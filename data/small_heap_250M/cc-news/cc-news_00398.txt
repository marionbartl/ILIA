In a new find, researchers have traced around 2000 ancient artifacts near the Norway glaciers. A group of archaeologists, while exploring Norway's glaciers got hold of theses artefacts that can reveal much information about ancient Norway and the history of mountain populations.
The archaeologists are from Norway and the United Kingdom, and they have been surveying the edge so of glaciers in Norway's highest mountains in Oppland since the year 2011 as part of the Glacier Archaeology Program and its Secrets of the ice projects. During their explorations, the archaeologists have discovered thousands of ancient artifacts like wooden skis, near complete bronze-age arrows, wooden shafts, Viking swords, clothing as well as the skulls of pack horses.
After analyzing those artefacts, the researchers found out that they date as far back as 4000 B.C. that means the artefacts are almost 6000 years old. Lars Pil√∏, co-director of the Glacier Archaeology Program said that in the glaciated mountain passes one can find basically anything. ‚ÄúObviously because of the fantastic artefacts, there's a lot of focus on the individual finds. But I think what is more important, perhaps, is the bigger picture,‚Äù he said.
The researchers were successful in getting ages of 153 artifacts out of those thousands of objects. They found out that the unearthed artefacts were not spread out evenly over time. The archaeologists got surprised when they found out that the activities got intensified during the Late Antique Little Ice Age (c. 536 ‚Äì 660 AD). At that time the earth was gradually cooling thus resulting in failure of harvest and falling of populations. The study indicated that during the Late Antique Little Ice Age the hunters and foragers dominated the mountain ranges and mountain hunting was a top priory work so as to supplement failing agricultural harvests in times of low temperatures.
The weapons and artefacts used by those hunters and foragers became frozen in glaciers over the years. But now, due to climate change, the glaciers are melting, and that has resulted in exposure of these 6000 years old artifacts. Although researchers are excited to study those artifacts, at the same time they are concerned that that exposure of these fragile artefacts to the elements might lead to their degradation. The ice of Norway's mountains had perfectly preserved those artifacts. The latest study was published in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

Re-signing Jason Pierre-Paul isn't quite as simple as bringing back a dynamic talent. The New York Giants must weigh the cost against the benefits.
From a pure talent and execution perspective, it's easy to argue that the New York Giants should re-sign Jason Pierre-Paul. He's one of the Top 15 edge defenders in the NFL and a cornerstone of the Giants' elite defense.
If general manager Jerry Reese is going to re-sign Pierre-Paul, however, the cost simply cannot be ignored.
The basics of the cost is what the Giants would have to pay Pierre-Paul directly. Even at this relatively early juncture, that much is somewhat understood by both the front office and the masses.
The true measure of the cost, however, is the amount of money New York would be paying between two defensive ends.
Reese signed 2016 free agent Olivier Vernon to a ‚Ä¶

Kim Kardashian, center, arrives with her attorney Shawn Chapman Holley at the security entrance of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, May 30.
Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP
Kim Kardashian West made waves at the White House Wednesday.
The reality TV star personally met with President Trump, who tweeted out a smiling photo with Kardashian West in the Oval Office.
"Great meeting with @KimKardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing," wrote the president.
In their version of Twitter diplomacy, she later tweeted her thanks to the president.
Dressed in all black with bright yellow pumps, Kardashian West arrived at a security entrance with her lawyer, attorney Shawn Chapman Holley, late Wednesday afternoon.
Great meeting with @KimKardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing. pic.twitter.com/uOy4UJ41JF ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2018
During the meeting, which was set to include senior advisor Jared Kushner, Kardashian West advocated for the release of 62-year-old Alice Marie Johnson, who is serving a life sentence for a first-time, nonviolent drug offense, according to her post-meeting tweet. She has shared her support of Johnson on social media, calling the sentencing "so unfair" on Twitter in October.
She thanked the president and expressed hope he would "grant clemency to Ms. Alice Marie Johnson" after they met.
I would like to thank President Trump for his time this afternoon. It is our hope that the President will grant clemency to Ms. Alice Marie Johnson who is serving a life sentence for a first-time, non-violent drug offense. ‚Äî Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 31, 2018
She added in a second tweet: "We are optimistic about Mrs. Johnson's future and hopeful that she ‚Äî and so many like her ‚Äî will get a second chance at life."

Earlier Wednesday, Kardashian West tweeted a birthday message for Johnson.
"Happy Birthday Alice Marie Johnson," she wrote. "Today is for you."
Happy Birthday Alice Marie Johnson. Today is for you üôèüèº‚ú® ‚Äî Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 30, 2018
Johnson's story went viral thanks in part to a Mic video interview that reached more than 4.1 million views. A change.org petition asking President Trump to grant Johnson clemency has also almost reached its goal of 300,000 supporter signatures as of Wednesday.
Kardashian West, who cites Mic's video as how she discovered Johnson, has also helped the case reach a wider audience.
Kushner has focused on prison reform since joining the administration. He was involved with the First Step Act, which plans to expand programs for prisoners and allow for more home confinement. The act was approved by the House of Representatives earlier this month.
A pardon or commutation for Johnson is unlikely today, though the president has not made a decision.
Kardashian West supported Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race, but recently, her husband Kanye West has tweeted his support for Trump.
The rapper met with Trump in December 2016 during a visit to the Trump Tower in New York. Trump posed with West after their meeting, calling him a "good man" with whom he talked about "life."
Kanye had previously declared his allegiance to Trump onstage the month prior.

She's not shy about making a statement, and Gigi Hadid has used her video for Love magazine's annual advent calendar to make a very empowering one indeed.
Rather than being waxed to within an inch of her life, the model instead sports some impressive armpit hair as she throws punches for the calendar's 'stay strong' theme.
‚ÄúI'm Gigi Hadid. Today is free form day,‚Äù she tells the camera.
And speaking about her bold move, she said of Love's annual offering, ‚ÄúIt's celebratory of epic human beings and always pushed boundaries.

‚ÄúThe Love Advent kind of feels like a holiday year book in a way."
It comes after the sexy star celebrated her second anniversary with boyfriend Zayn Malik.
To mark the occasion, the good-looking duo puckered up in a sweet Boomerang video on her Instagram stories.
"2 years with my favourite human," she captioned the cute post.
The pair first got together after Zayn approached Gigi at a Victoria's Secret after-show party in New York in November 2015.
Speaking about their first date, Gigi previously said they hit it off straight away.

"We played it cool for like 10 minutes and then I was like, 'You're really cute.'" the supermodel said.
"We connected like, really quickly, and just‚Äîwe just started, like yeah, we had the kind of same sense of humour and [started] sharing videos and obviously Noah Ritter videos started coming up‚Ä¶."
And back in March Zayn opened up about his girlfriend in a rare interview.
(Image: gigihadid/Instagram)

"She's been living with me for the past year. I've not taken her to Bradford, no - not yet. She's met my family in London a few times, though," he told the Sunday Times Style magazine.
He also revealed that, after they starred together in his Pillowtalk video, that she's "a really good artist - really creative".
Since giving that interview, Gigi has also met Zayn's mum Trisha on the other side of the pond, with the model's mum Yolanda recently sharing a sweet family snap of them altogether.

Former Real Housewives star Yolanda captioned it:Ô∏è "Eid Mubarak to everyone celebrating..."

Trisha also uploaded the same photo to her Instagram account and wrote an identical caption along with the hashtag "blessed day".
And those uploads came just a few days after Yolanda had posted a sweet shot of the Victoria's Secret beauty and Zayn sharing a warm embrace.
"Summer loving #family," the proud mum wrote next to it.
The Columbus Blue Jackets are in the midst of a 15-game winning streak. It's tied for the second-longest single-season such streak in NHL history. The Pittsburgh Penguins had a 17-game win streak during the 1992-93 season.
Everything is clearly going right for the Blue Jackets, but how long can they keep this up? They have three tough tests this week. Columbus faces the Edmonton Oilers on Tuesday, visits the Washington Capitals on Thursday and hosts the New York Rangers on Saturday.
The Jackets' keeping up their winning ways depend on the continued sharp play of goalie Sergei Bobrovsky, who is 14-0-1 in his past 15 games. The Oilers could play spoiler by using their speed to stifle the Columbus attack. But when you dissect the Blue Jackets' game right now, you don't find many holes. They are hardworking and play with determination and confidence while getting the puck to bounce their way.
It's hard to imagine how this team can lose right now, but it seems unlikely that it'll run the table for the rest of the season. Will this be the week Columbus comes back to Earth?
The Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs is hoping to see residential sprinkler systems installed in new homes.
In recent years, fires have been cutting through homes more quickly, Edmonton Fire Chief Ken Block told 630 CHED's Afternoon News on Wednesday, noting sprinklers would help keep them contained.
Block said new construction materials play a factor in the increase in fire volatility.
‚ÄúReally what's changed over the last 15 to 18 years is the materials that are used to construct homes, and the materials that are used to make furniture coverings, floor coverings and everything we put in those homes.‚Äù
READ MORE: Edmonton fire chief discusses overdoses, terror attacks in year-end interview
Block said those new materials are made from synthetics, rather than natural materials used in decades past.
He also said a shift towards open-concept homes also plays a part in the escalation of fire damage to homes.
Block added that sprinklers are not a perfect solution but would help firefighters move more quickly through homes that are on fire, since the flames would be subdued.
But he also said that he's heard pushback from new home builders over the idea.
‚ÄúI think there's some tunnel vision there,‚Äù Block said. ‚ÄúI would like to think that we could sit down and have a fulsome discussion. The costs, as the National Fire Protection Association measures it, are around $1.35 per square foot.‚Äù

Block said that most current fire codes need to be updated, as they relate to houses from the 1960s, when homes were smaller and made from natural materials.

(Bloomberg)‚ÄîIt's becoming an endless wait for U.S. inflation to pick up. And the fifth straight miss on core-price forecasts adds to the burden on Federal Reserve policymakers to explain why they're moving toward a December interest-rate increase.
Consumer prices continued to be subdued in July, a Labor Department report showed Friday, pushing against the idea that unemployment at a 16-year low will help inflation accelerate. Declines in hotel rates, vehicle prices and child care accompanied a continuing drop in wireless-phone service costs that some Fed officials have labeled as transitory.
Highlights of Consumer Price Index (July)
Consumer price index rose 0.1% m/m (est. 0.2%) after no change the prior month; up 1.7% y/y (est. 1.8%) Excluding food and energy, so-called core CPI rose 0.1% m/m (est. 0.2%); up 1.7% y/y (matching est.) Five-month gain in core CPI is the weakest stretch since 2010 Hotel costs fell record 4.9% m/m; new vehicle prices dropped 0.5%, most since 2009.
Economists also cite retailers' lack of pricing power and still-tepid wage gains as factors keeping price pressures subdued, with the July results another sign inflation may take longer to reach the central bank's goal even as it prepares to wind down asset holdings. The report adds fodder to the debate among policymakers over whether price gains are indeed making clear progress toward their 2 percent goal.
‚ÄúThis is a string of five weak prints in a row -- it is not just noise, it's the trend, and it reflects rotating factors that are pretty broad-based,‚Äù said Laura Rosner, senior economist and partner at MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC and a former New York Fed analyst. ‚ÄúIt probably lowers the odds of them hiking later this year after they start to normalize the balance sheet.‚Äù
While the central bank's gradual approach to raising borrowing costs has helped reduce unemployment, it has failed to lift inflation to its target, matching or exceeding it in only two months of the last five years. The gauge hit 2 percent early in 2017 only to slide back.
The weak inflation report helped push the dollar and Treasury yields lower. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg earlier this month saw the Fed lifting rates by a quarter percentage point at their Dec. 12-13 meeting. Analysts also cut inflation forecasts for this year and next.
Odds in financial markets for a December rate increase stood at 30 percent after the data, unchanged from before the report.
More Progress
‚ÄúI actually want to now see more evidence that we're making progress in reaching our inflation objective,‚Äù Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said Friday after the report. He said he feels comfortable that the current level of interest rates ‚Äúis the perfect place for us to be.‚Äù
William Dudley, head of the New York Fed, said Thursday that ‚Äúit's going to take some time‚Äù for inflation to rise to the central bank's target.
The Fed's goal is based on a separate Commerce Department price measure that is related to consumption and contains many components of the consumer price index. That gauge will be released on Aug. 31.
‚ÄúThe Fed will want to see a number of months of at least stable inflation, and preferably some uptick in inflation, before they'll be happy,‚Äù said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies LLC in New York. ‚ÄúFor the time being, rate hikes are on the back burner for the Fed.‚Äù
Inflation isn't totally disappearing: Even though the monthly rise in the main CPI fell short of economists' forecasts, the increase did follow an unchanged reading. Categories showing gains included apparel, medical care and transportation services, and owners equivalent rent.
Signs of stabilization, following several months of very weak inflation readings, may give some ammunition to those who project price pressures will build.
Inflation is ‚Äúweaker than the Fed would like, weaker than anyone would like, but not so weak that it calls the whole outlook into question,‚Äù said Roberto Perli, partner at Cornerstone Macro LLC in Washington, and a former Fed official. ‚ÄúWe're still within striking distance of 2 percent -- it's not the end of the world,‚Äù he said, referring to the Fed's inflation goal.
Still, ‚Äúthey have a lot of reasons to be cautious,‚Äù Perli said. ‚ÄúThey probably still think the weakness in inflation is temporary, but they cannot be sure.‚Äù
One of the big downward surprises was the record decline in hotel rates. ‚ÄúIf this single category had been flat, the core CPI would have rounded up to 0.2 percent and the narrative around this release would be entirely different,‚Äù Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC, said in a note.
The Fed will have several more reports on inflation to digest before its December meeting.
‚ÄúThey need to figure out what's going on with inflation before they continue to move,‚Äù Rosner said. ‚ÄúIt's going to require more analysis, more discussion, and we've seen that uncertainty slow them down in the past, and I think we'll see it slow them down again.‚Äù

Bitcoin futures rise as virtual currency hits major exchange
The first-ever bitcoin future jumped after it began trading Sunday as the increasingly popular virtual currency made its debut on a major U.S. exchange.
The futures contract that expires in January surged more than $3,000 to $18,580 eight hours after trading launched on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. The contract opened at $15,000, according to data from the CBOE.
The CBOE futures don't involve actual bitcoin. They're securities that will track the price of bitcoin on Gemini, one of the larger bitcoin exchanges.
The start of trading at 5 p.m. CST overwhelmed the CBOE website. ‚ÄúDue to heavy traffic on our website, visitors to www.cboe.com may find that it is performing slower than usual and may at times be temporarily unavailable,‚Äù the exchange said in a statement. But it said the trading in the futures had not been disrupted.
MORE: Millions of dollars may have been stolen in bitcoin hack
Another large futures exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, will start trading its own futures on Dec. 18 but will use a composite of several bitcoin prices across a handful of exchanges.
The price of a bitcoin has soared since beginning the year below $1,000, hitting a peak of more than $16,858 Dec. 7 on the bitcoin exchange Coindesk. As of 1:15 a.m. CST, it was at $16,733.49 on Coindesk.
Futures are a type of contract in which a buyer and a seller agree on a price for a particular item to be delivered on a certain date in the future, hence the name. Futures are available for nearly every type of security but are most famously used in commodities such as wheat, soy, gold, oil, cocoa and, as dramatized in the Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd movie ‚ÄúTrading Places,‚Äù concentrated frozen orange juice.
The futures signal greater mainstream acceptance of bitcoin but also open up bitcoin to additional market forces. The futures will allow investors to bet that bitcoin's price will go down ‚Äì a practice known as shorting ‚Äì which currently is very difficult to do.
There have been other attempts to bring bitcoin investing into the mainstream. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, twin brothers who own large amounts of bitcoin, tried to create an exchange-traded fund based on bitcoin, but federal regulators denied their application.
How much actual investor interest there will be in these bitcoin futures is still up in the air. Many larger Wall Street brokerages and clearinghouses, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, are either not allowing customers to trade bitcoin futures or only allowing select clients to do so. Other brokerages are putting restrictions on the amount of margin a trader can use in bitcoin futures, or putting limits on the amount that can be purchased.
The digital currency has had more than its fair share of critics on Wall Street. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin ‚Äúa fraud.‚Äù Thomas Peterffy, chairman of the broker-dealer Interactive Brokers Group, expressed deep concerns about the trading of bitcoin futures last month, saying ‚Äúthere is no fundamental basis for valuation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and they may assume any price from one day to the next.‚Äù
MORE: Tech stocks and bitcoin go wild ‚Äì in opposite directions
Peterffy noted that if bitcoin futures were trading at that time, under the CBOE's rules those futures likely would experience repeated trading halts because 10 percent or 20 percent moves in bitcoin prices have not been unusual in recent months.
Bitcoin is the world's most popular virtual currency. Such currencies are not tied to a bank or government and allow users to spend money anonymously. They are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they are traded.
A debate is raging on the merits of such currencies. Some say they serve merely to facilitate money laundering and illicit, anonymous payments. Others say they can be helpful methods of payment, such as in crisis situations where national currencies have collapsed.

North American stock markets started the week on a positive note, surging ahead as investor fears calmed slightly following a tumultuous week of rhetoric between the U.S. and North Korea.
The S&P/TSX composite index advanced 86.53 points to 15,119.91.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 135.39 points to 21,993.71, while the S&P 500 index rose 24.52 points to 2,465.84. The Nasdaq composite climbed 81.06 points to 6,337.62.
The Canadian dollar was trading at an average price of US78.71¬¢, down 0.12 of a U.S. cent.
The September crude contract shed US$1.23 to US$47.59 a barrel, while the December gold contract fell US$3.60 to US$1,290.40.
Elsewhere in commodities, the September natural gas contract fell US2.4¬¢ to about US$2.96 per mmBTU and the September copper contract declined US0.75¬¢ to US$2.90 a pound.
The Saskatchewan government said taxpayers in the province will save an estimated $9 million in 2017 due to indexation.
Income tax brackets and tax credit amounts will rise 1.4 per cent this year, matching the national rate of inflation.
‚ÄúIndexation helps keep taxes in Saskatchewan low by protecting Saskatchewan people from ‚Äòbracket creep,'‚Äù Finance Minister Kevin Doherty said in a statement.
‚ÄúOur government is committed to keeping Saskatchewan's tax system fair and competitive, and yearly indexation is part of an array of measures aimed at accomplishing just that.‚Äù

The increase means an individual will not pay provincial income tax on their first $19,490 of income.
For a family of four, no provincial income tax will be paid on the first $50,495 of income. Officials said that is the highest tax-free income threshold in the country for a family of four.
‚ÄúOver the period of 2008-2017, these personal income tax reductions will have provided a Saskatchewan family of four earning $50,000 in income with total income tax savings amounting to more than $23,000,‚Äù Doherty stated.

According to Doherty, various personal income tax deductions since 2008 have resulted in approximately 112,000 low-income people being removed for the tax roll.
Officials said some of those measures include increasing exemption amounts, introducing a new low-income tax credit and bringing in a new first-time homebuyers tax credit.

KARACHI - A petition was filed at the Sindh High Court seeking disqualification of PPP leader Faryal Talpur for allegedly holding iqama.
The petition has been filed by Moazzam Abbasi, submitting that Faryal Talpur is holding an iqama issued by the Saudi government for the work and residential purpose. He added that Faryal Talpur also formed a company in 2002 in Dubai which was made in Talpur's daughter Sahibzadi Ayesha's name. The petitioner alleged that the transfer of money to Dubai was hidden from the Election Commission of Pakistan.
A two-member judge bench headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar after hearing initial arguments from the petitioner's counsel has issued notices regarding maintainability of the petition by June 5. Earlier, as many as four identical petitions have been filed against the PPP leaders. Mumtaz Ali Chandio moved a petition seeking disqualification of Ghaibi Nawab Sardar Khan Chandio, elected from District Qambar Shehzadkot in 2013. The petitioner submitted that Khan is holding an Iqama of the UAE, but did not mention it to the election.
Similarly, others were filed to disqualify three former PP ministers Sohail Anwar Siyal, Ministers, Nasir Shah, Manzoor Wasan.
The petitioners pleaded the court to disqualify the PPP lawmakers for no declaring their Iqama. They also prayed to restrain them from contesting election and also declare them as disqualify for holding any public office.
The petitioners stated that it is tantamount to violation of Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution read with Sections 99(I)(f) of the Representation of People Act 1976.
The BlackBerry KEYone is stronger than you think.
The BlackBerry KEYone has been through the wringer over the past week or so, with claims that its screen, bereft of sufficient adhesive, easily detaches from the body with only a small amount of force. Popular YouTube channel JerryRigEverything entered the phone into its oh-so-sad Hall of Shame after Zack was easily able to break the phone with his bare hands. A small number of people had already reported the screen detaching through normal everyday use.
Shortly afterwards, BlackBerry Mobile released a statement saying it was looking into the problem ‚Äî which has only affected a handful of units ‚Äî and may alter the manufacturing process to include additional adhesive in future units.
Still, CrackBerry Kevin took the assertion that the KEYone was weak as a challenge, pitting the phone against the Galaxy S8+ and iPhone 7 Plus in a number of durability challenges. I won't spoil the surprise, but suffice it to say the KEYone did better than even I expected.

BY Ade Adefeko
It is not very often you are called upon to be part of a conversation that involves a behemoth and a global giant (not in size as per land mass or population) but with credibility built over the decades. I am writing this piece aboard an African bird with a Livery that is authentically African and that is Ethiopian Air which like its maxim says, is the New Spirit of Africa. I am quite enamored of them and will crave your indulgence to shower on them a few unsolicited encomiums.
I am extremely proud of the airline which by the way is the flag carrier of Ethiopia and flies to 113 destinations with 92 aircraft and another 60 in order. It is currently the largest, the only government owned but privately run airline in Africa and boasts a profit to boot. It is worth mentioning, that it is the second oldest airline in Africa and started business 73 years ago. What is more remarkable is the way they connect to major hubs in the world through Addis Ababa.
For a frequent flier and traveler like me, ability to connect is key to my work sojourn and this was given fillip by the opening of Kaduna their fifth gateway into Nigeria (Lagos, Abuja, Enugu, Kano) and I must buttress they put their best aircraft's forward-Dream liner from Boeing. For one who was flying to the land of the rising sun for the first time and flying Ethiopia air only for the second time, it was value for money and time as it was the shortest to the Asia Pacific country 17 hours with transit time. In this era of comparative advantage and competitiveness, Ethiopia Air stands out.
I digress, as a panelist at the 2nd Japan/Africa Business forum in Tokyo, the theme: Investment and Business Opportunities with Africa, organized by African Development Bank (AfDB) in conjunction with the African Diplomatic Corps Heads of Mission in Japan, resonated with me. Why? I remember reading Indian born Vijay Mahajan's AFRICA RISING where he confessed to seeing Africa initially as a charity case rather than a market opportunity.
The former Dean of the Indian School of Business went further and I quote him copiously ‚ÄúI have sought to learn as much as I possibly could about the African market, what it offers, how it is structured and its potential. Others have looked at Africa through a political lens, some have engaged in economic analysis, some have examined its complex history, and others have looked at medical or social challenges'. A few have even started telling the stories of specific African businesses but my focus is on understanding the continent through the perspective of the consumer, what is the African market, what opportunities do it offer and how are companies recognizing the opportunities in Africa's rising.''
This book was written in 2008 and the above could not be truer in Tokyo with our Japanese hosts, nine years after. The Japanese before now have always seen us from the prism of a Continent in need of AID rather than that in need of TRADE. The onus on us Panelist from across Africa in different spheres of endeavor was to change that narrative by telling them the opportunities that abound and the way to get in.
Speaking on the panel on Agriculture and Agri- business-Enhancing the Food Value Chain in Africa, I highlighted the need for the Japanese to seek ways in which they can improve trade with the continent particularly in the area of investments in factories that turn our primary products into semi or finished products and the need to see us as partners not mendicants.
The panel comprised of the Minister of Trade and Foreign Affairs for Madagascar, the Malawian minister for Trade and Industry and the Managing Director of OCP (Moroccan Phosphate giants) and we all spoke in unison telling our audience; which comprised of the Japanese government and organized private sector.
We are a continent that represents the new frontier for bilateral trade and investment and we must not only be seen as such but treated as such.
From a geographical perspective, Japan is an Island in the Asia pacific and for a first timer like me; offered an array of experiences from the clean pristine streets, to the architectural masterpiece buoyed by technology to its culture and lifestyle. Suffice to say, it has a population of about 126million people sitting on a landmass a third of Nigeria at approximately 365,000Km¬≤. Not forgetting the culinary repertoire that Japan boasts of like sushi etal and of course for whiskey lovers of single malt, the SAKI. Longevity seems to be a birthright of oriental Japan with life expectancy of 83 years. Boasting of an ageing population‚Ä¶there is something about Japan and longevity‚Ä¶
The Aged in Japan enjoy wealth as they progress on the life Richter scale, a lot of them credit it to genes and diet which is of course part of their lifestyle. Foods are less oily and very vegan. I happened to have met two ladies one 84 and the other 85, schoolmates who worked at the Hiroshima centre. They both are single with no kids and never married! Most Japanese are more familiar with the Maghreb/ North Africa and not sub-Saharan Africa; they view Africa as a continent rather than individual countries.
Students of history will recall that Japan colonized China and Korea during the Second World War and were truly the only imperial power at the time, hence their technological innovations. But as in everything in life; you have to open up. The Japanese were too insular and took time to open up. Unlike the USSR (Old Soviet Union), who embraced Glasnost and Perestroika (which signifies openness or change).
On the other hand, South Korea also opened up by setting up ‚ÄòChaebols' like Samsung, Hyundai and LG. Furthermore, Ask Xerox of America who claimed they taught the world to copy and paradoxically the world has since moved on. Ask Kodak of Polaroid fame. Ask Finland's Nokia ‚Äì innovate or die.
Anyway, pardon my digression, in Japan, quality of life is very high as measured by the following parameters: minimum wage is $3,500 for a start (USD equivalent to the Yen), healthcare is free and they do not entertain medical tourism as their country is built for their citizens and not foreigners. The quality and technological innovation in Japan is second to none, with minimal pollution and very low crime rates. Prisons look like motels and technology takes the place of humans' almost a robotic life.
The average Japanese family has a child and they have an ageing population where the young are not interested in relationships or marriages. They have the highest work ethic in the world to the point where the average Japanese wants to get it right the first time all the time. Else, they subject themselves to Harakiri which is loosely defined as a form of suicide as for them failure is not an option.
Coming back home, Nigeria can learn a lesson or two from the Japanese, particularly on the leadership front. In Japan, as I found out, the leaders already have a vision based on deep blue sky thinking and all the follower-ship does is to execute and run with the plans. Conversely, in Nigeria it appears the leadership at the top echelon do not seem to have a plan hence the follower-ship has nothing to execute as the follow-ship now becomes both thinker and doer.
This brings me back to the fact that we as a nation must have a collective plan that feeds into individuals' hopes and aspirations. So much to learn from the land of the rising sun‚Ä¶

COLOMBO: An Indian delegation is in Colombo to discuss a possible joint venture to operate the loss-making Mattala international airport in southern Sri Lanka, the Sirisena government said on Wednesday.Sri Lankan deputy minister of transport Ashok Abeysinghe stated this in parliament while answering an opposition query on whether the Mattala airport would be sold outright.Abeysinghe said India has expressed willingness to operate the airport as a Sri Lanka-India joint venture."Despite making losses the airport would never be sold," he said.Mattala airport, named after former president Mahinda Rajapaksa , was a China-supported infrastructure project in his home district of Hambantota.The $210 million facility is dubbed the world's emptiest airport due to a. The only international flight operating from there was halted in May due to recurrent losses and flight safety issues.The government in 2017 invited investors to turn the airport into a profit-sharing joint venture. However no proposals were received to operate, manage and maintain the airport.The seaport built in Hambantota, another Rajapaksa pet project, has beento set off Chinese loans as equity.The Rajapaksa-led opposition has called the Hambantota seaport deal a sell out of national assets to China.
DEAR ABBY >> I am a full-time nanny for a family with two children, ages 7 and 9. The mother is wonderful, and so are the kids. But the father, who is absent due to work travel most of the time, teaches his children attitudes I strongly disagree with. It is not often I must interact with him, but when I have, he says hateful things about people who are gay, obese or poor.
The children have now begun to repeat these comments, pointing out large people when we are in public, or saying nasty things about the homeless we see as we drive. I try to combat this hatred by sharing words of love or acceptance.
The mom is mortified when I tell her the things her children have said. She doesn¬ít share the same attitudes as her husband, but she works a lot and isn¬ít around to discuss things like this with her kids in the moment.
I feel like part of the family because I spend so much time with the children. But I wonder if I am overstepping my boundaries by admonishing them for saying things their father has taught them to believe. Is it my place to teach the kids lessons about acceptance that are contrary to what he tells them?

This statement was originally published on mfwa.org on 29 September 2017.
Thirty-four FM broadcasting stations have been shut down by the National Communications Authority (NCA), the Communications regulator and radio frequency licensing body in Ghana.
A statement released by the NCA on September 28, 2017 said the authorisations of the stations involved had expired over several years, but they had failed to apply for renewal 3 months before expiry of existing Authorisation as required by law. Moreover, some of them failed to respond to a notice the NCA sent to them earlier this year to regularise their operations.
The statement said while others responded to the regulator's notice to regularise their operations, their request for an extension was declined.
A total of 131 FM Authorisation Holders have been affected by the NCA clampdown which is being carried out in enforcement of Section 13 of the Electronics Communications Act (2009), Act 775.
These include very popular stations like Montie FM, a station aligned to the main opposition party, the National democratic Congress (NDC), Hello FM and Kapital Radio.
The regulator has also imposed fines on a number of stations ranging from GHC50,000 (US$11,000) to GHC61,000,000 (US$13.8 million) depending on the infraction and the duration the infraction persisted.
Eleven radio stations have been requested to pay application fees for renewal of Authorisation and to pay a fine in accordance with the NCA's gazetted Schedule of Penalties for failure to apply 3 months before expiry of Authorisation within 30 days. 16 radio stations have been asked to submit a renewal application, pay application fees and pay a fine within 30 days.
It would be recalled that the Minister of Communications, Ursula Owusu-Ekuful on July 6, 2017 hinted that the government was considering taking action against radio stations that are in breach of their licensing obligations.
"Much as the NCA recognises the key role the radio stations play in the socio‚Äêeconomic life of the country, dissemination of information, employment and investment opportunities it creates, it is important that players within that space adhere to the regulatory requirements and conditions of their Authorisations," the statement said.
The MFWA is concerned about this development, as it denies a section of the population their source of information. We find it a sad irony for radio stations to suffer such a fate on September 28, a day set aside to highlight the importance of universal access to information. We therefore urge the NCA and the Management of the stations involved to dialogue in order to find an amicable settlement to the issue.

Kim Kardashian West made waves at the White House Wednesday.
The reality TV star personally met with President Trump, who tweeted out a smiling photo with Kardashian West in the Oval Office.
"Great meeting with @KimKardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing," wrote the president.
Dressed in all black with bright yellow pumps, Kardashian West arrived at a security entrance with her lawyer, attorney Shawn Chapman Holley, late Wednesday afternoon.

During the meeting, which was set to include senior advisor Jared Kushner, Kardashian West was expected to advocate for the release of 62-year-old Alice Marie Johnson, who is serving a life sentence for a first-time, nonviolent drug offense. She has shared her support of Johnson on social media, calling the sentencing "so unfair" on Twitter in October.
Kardashian West tweeted a birthday message for Johnson Wednesday.
"Happy Birthday Alice Marie Johnson," she wrote. "Today is for you."
Happy Birthday Alice Marie Johnson. Today is for you üôèüèº‚ú® ‚Äî Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 30, 2018
Johnson's story went viral thanks in part to a Mic video interview that reached over 4.1 million views. A change.org petition asking President Trump to grant Johnson clemency has also almost reached it's goal of 300,000 supporter signatures as of Wednesday.
Kardashian West, who cites Mic's video as how she discovered Johnson, has also helped the case reach a wider audience.
Kushner has focused on prison reform since joining the administration. He was involved with the First Step Act, which plans to expand programs for prisoners and allow for more home confinement. The act was approved by the House of Representatives earlier this month.
A pardon or commutation for Johnson is unlikely today, though the president has not made a decision.
Kardashian West supported Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race, but recently, her husband Kanye West has tweeted his support for Trump.
The rapper met with Trump in December 2016 during a visit to the Trump Tower in New York. Trump posed with West after their meeting, calling him a "good man" with whom he talked about "life."
Kanye had previously declared his allegiance to Trump onstage the month prior.

DAVIS, Calif. ‚Äì Authorities say a 30-year-old woman is being charged with hate crimes after police say she broke windows and left bacon at a Northern California mosque.
The Sacramento Bee reports that the Yolo County District Attorney's Office announced the arrest of Lauren Kirk-Coehlo of Davis on Tuesday.
She is charged in the vandalism of the Davis Islamic Center last month. The vandal broke six windows and two bicycles and put bacon strips on door handles.

Harman International on Monday introduced its voice-activated speaker, Allure in India for Rs 22,490. The speaker which was unveiled earlier this year at IFA Berlin in August is now available Prime members on Amazon.in.
The Allure provides 360-degree audio while also featuring an ambient light that glows from the top half of the cannister-shaped speaker. The highlight of the Harman Kardon Allure is its capability of using Amazon's voice-based assistant Alexa for an array of hands-free interactions that the assistant can perform. Alexa is capable of playing music, read the news or even make purchases on the Amazon website.
The speaker also gets support for Bluetooth playback from any Bluetooth-based device, be it a smartphone or a portable multimedia player. The Allure also features a four-microphone array which provides better noise-cancellation for Alexa to work optimally.
Commenting on the launch, Sumit Chauhan, vice president, Lifestyle Audio Division for Harman India said, "Ever since its launch at IFA, we have seen tremendous interest and demand for the 'Harman Kardon Allure' from our Indian customers."
Harman had in October launched a range of JBL, Harman Kardon and Infinity products in India ranging from Rs 1,119 up to Rs 39,990. The company had also announced at the time that its JBL and Harman Kardon products would be available across 350 of Samsung's key brand stores in the country by the end of 2017.
New England Patriots defensive end Deatrich Wise may not be out long, according to the Boston Herald. Wise's concussion could only be a one-week setback.
Deatrich Wise might only miss about a week due to his concussion, per source. ‚Äî Jeff Howe (@jeffphowe) August 11, 2017
The rookie went down in the second quarter against the Jacksonville Jaguars during Week 1 of preseason. Wise, a 2017 fourth rounder, is in the mix to start at left defensive end for New England. He has taken reps with the top unit, but while many of the top defensive players rested during the preseason opener, Wise played. The Patriots were likely looking to evaluate him to determine if he's ready for the starting role. That evaluation got cut short.
Injuries derailed Wise's final college season. The Patriots are surely hoping they don't also derail his first NFL season.

* ‚Äç TRADING IN CO‚ÄòS SHARES HALTED PENDING ANNOUNCEMENT ON INSIDE INFORMATION OF CO‚Äã Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:
Quebec's auditor general has raised more concerns about the transport ministry. She said contracts are not fairly distributed ‚Äì small firms are often excluded and cost estimates are not properly conducted.
READ MORE: Transports Quebec suffers from breakdown in communication: auditor general
Last year, a whistle-blower alleged there was major corruption within Transports Qu√©bec. The province's anti-corruption squad opened 10 cases based on the information Annie Trudel gave them on a USB key.
But wednesday, the auditor general said she couldn't prove Trudel's allegations.
‚ÄúI'm not there to answer if the allegations had basis; it's not my role. The Treasury Board asked me to do a review,‚Äù said Guylaine Leclerc.
READ MORE: Fraud victim compensation program is costly but money isn't going to victims
What she did find was a ministry struggling to keep its costs under control.
Leclerc didn't give a dollar figure of how much mismanagement is costing taxpayers, but the overall takeaway from her report is that the ministry lacks the expertise necessary to make sure it's getting the best price possible.
And that's a big deal because the ministry contracts out 95 per cent of its work to private firms. Leclerc said the ministry is not properly ensuring the quality of the work being done either.
‚ÄúThis is absolutely what we've been saying since three weeks, since the beginning of our strike. We have a problem with the expertise at the Ministere des Transport du Quebec and the auditor general is saying absolutely the same thing,‚Äù said the engineers' union president, Marc-Andr√© Martin.
READ MORE: Could Quebec engineers be forced back to work?
Government engineers returned to work Wednesday after the government threatened to legislate them back. The union insists low wages are driving away experienced employees, but the Treasury Board president had a different interpretation of Leclerc's report:
‚ÄúNowhere in that report does the auditor general provide that there's not enough engineers at the transport department,‚Äù Pierre Moreau, said.
Moreau made a final offer to engineers at 5 p.m. As for fixing the problems with the transport ministry, he said the government has already started hiring more experienced employees.
BLANTYRE-(MaraviPost)-The High Court judge Zione Ntaba this week stopped her boss Chief Justice (CJ) Andrew Nyirenda and the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) from proceeding to recruit third grade magistrates until the decision is judiciary reviewed.
This follows an application last month by some 16 court clerks working across the country who dragged the two to court for allegedly breaching the law in recruiting the new third grade magistrates.
The judge has granted all the orders that were being sought by the disgruntled court clerks, including the injunction reliefs against the recruitment of the said magistrates.
High Court and Supreme Court of Appeal registrar Agnes Patemba and lawyer for the court clerks Chancy Gondwe confirmed the development to The Nation Newspaper in separate interviews on Tuesday.
‚ÄúThis means the Judicial Service Commission cannot proceed to recruit the new third grade magistrates up until the determination of the substantive judicial review action‚Ä¶ The Chief Justice cannot also proceed to appoint the new third grade magistrates,‚Äù says Gondwe.
On her part, Patemba said they would wait for the outcome of the judicial review proceedings for the way forward.
In her determination, Ntaba agreed with the court clerks that the case is suitable for consideration for judicial review; hence, granting them leave to apply.
She said: ‚ÄúThe claimants are granted leave to apply for judicial review and that the matter be expedited. And that all processes should have their times abridged due to the urgency of the matter.‚Äù
The displeased clerks, who hold different grades in the judiciary, are challenging the decision made by the two to employ ‚Äòoutsiders' after they were promised to be offered the jobs.
According to the workers, they were assured that upon obtaining their diplomas in law from University of Malawi they would be considered as third grade magistrates.
The Voice competition is coming to an end and Adam Cunningham's family says he is one step closer to hopefully reaching the Top 4. Eight performed tonight and tomorrow, the Top 4 performers will be announced.
"He has kind of lived a dream of his and I just hope he takes this and uses it for the rest of his life," said Mary Cunningham, Adam's mother.
His father, Tim Cunningham, said it has been an exciting journey.
"I'd like to see him make in the final because I told him if he gets in the final, I'm going out there," he said.
Adam's wife, Courtney, has been cheering him on from Nashville.
I feel like he's done incredible. He has been the bottom two two times and managed to save himself, so tonight is going to be really pivotal in his journey," she said.
Although he's been in the bottom two, his family says it did not bring him down.
"When he has heard negative comments like Tim has said, those spur him on. They make him work even harder and that is a good lesson to learn -- don't let them get you down," said Mary.
Adam was saved last week and his family is beyond proud of everything he has accomplished thus far.
"And I say he works for everything that he gets and the way he reacted when they called his name is exactly the kind of guy he is," said Mary.
Adam's wife, Courtney, said he gives it his all and that no matter what, he is already considered a winner at home.
"But he, he's already won. And as far as music goes, I think he was born a winner, so we're okay with whatever happens," she said.
While it is in the voters' hands tonight, Adam's family and community are certainly behind him.
"We love him, we're so proud of him. Iowa is cheering him on, Nashville is certainly cheering him on, so he has big stuff ahead of him no matter what," said Courtney.

OWINGS MILLS, Md. -- The Baltimore Ravens added an experienced arm for training camp, signing journeyman quarterback Thad Lewis on Monday.
Lewis is the latest quarterback to be signed by the Ravens since the team said it was considering signing controversial free agent Colin Kaepernick.
The Ravens have been shuffling quarterbacks all summer behind Ryan Mallett, who is filling in for the injured Joe Flacco. Baltimore has signed three quarterbacks since training camp began.
Lewis, 29, has played for seven teams over the past seven seasons, compiling a 2-4 record as a starter. He hasn't thrown a pass in a regular-season game since 2013, but he's had more extensive work than Dustin Vaughan, who was released by Baltimore on Monday.
The Ravens brought in Lewis after Vaughan struggled in Thursday's preseason opener and dropped to the bottom of the depth chart. Baltimore will go with Mallett, Lewis and Josh Woodrum in Thursday's preseason game at Miami.
Flacco won't play in the preseason because of a back issue but is expected to be ready to start the Sept. 10 regular-season opener in Cincinnati.
In a news conference held Monday morning, President Trump commented on the racially motivated violence that took place in Virginia over the weekend. In the statement, he referred to the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups, calling them repugnant. The groups have been lumped together when talking about the recent violence, but what is the difference among them?
The Southern Poverty Law Centre, a nonprofit legal advocacy organization, monitors hate groups and other extremists throughout the U.S. On their website, they describe the beliefs of these groups.
The SPLC says that these 'white nationalist groups' support white supremacist or white separatist ideologies, often focusing on the alleged inferiority of nonwhites. Groups are listed in a variety of other sub categories, including the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Confederate, neo-Nazi, racist skinhead, and Christian Identity, and could also be fairly described as white nationalist.
According to the SPLC; The Ku Klux Klan, has a long history of violence, is the most infamous and oldest of American hate groups. AThe Klan's primary target has been black Americans but, it also has attacked Jews, immigrants, gays and lesbians and, until recently, Catholics.
The SPLC says Neo-Nazi Neo-Nazigroups share a hatred for Jews and a love for Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. According to the SPLC, they also hate other minorities, gays and lesbians and even sometimes Christians, they perceive "the Jew" as their cardinal enemy.
Christian Identity is defined by the SPLC as a unique anti-Semitic and racist theology. They say that it rose to a position of commanding influence on the racist right in the 1980s. "Christian" in name only, the movement's relationship with evangelicals and fundamentalists has generally been hostile due to the latter's belief that the return of Jews to Israel is essential to the fulfillment of end-time prophecy.
Racist Skinheadsform a particularly violent element of the white supremacist movement according to the SPLC, and have often been referred to as the "shock troops" of the hoped-for revolution. The SPLC says the classic Skinhead look is a shaved head, black Doc Martens boots, jeans with suspenders and an array of typically racist tattoos.
Another group associated with the white supremacist movement is the "alt-right". The SPLC describes the "alt-right" as: a set of far-right ideologies, groups and individuals whose core belief is that "white identity" is under attack by multicultural forces using "political correctness" and "social justice" to undermine white people and "their" civilization. "Characterized by heavy use of social media and online memes, Alt-Righters eschew "establishment" conservatism, skew young, and embrace white ethno-nationalism as a fundamental value."

Sarah Sanders chokes up
A cub reporter got an emotional response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Wednesday. Benje Choucroun, a young student covering an event for Time for Kids, told her about the fear of being shot at school and asked what the administration would do. "Certainly as a parent, there is nothing more terrifying than for a kid to go to school and not feel safe, so I'm sorry you feel that way," Sanders said, her voice wavering. Guns have caused injury or death 21 times in 2018 on U.S. school campuses. Rep. Diane Black, a Republican candidate to be the next Tennessee governor, on Tuesday blamed the Internet, violent movies and pornography for school shootings. One video game that recently drew criticism from both sides of the aisle was "Active Shooter," which simulated a school shooting; the owners of the video game marketplace Steam said it was created by "a troll with a history of customer abuse" and removed it.
Trump is so regretting Jeff Sessions right about now
President Trump had five words after hearing Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy said he could've picked someone besides Jeff Session for attorney general: "And I wish I did!" Trump's tweet followed a New York Times report that investigators want to know just how Trump tried to persuade Sessions not to back out from the Russia investigation because of his Russian contacts. Meanwhile, a Senate panel is readying Congress' last chance to weigh in on Russia, and those on the committee ‚Äî from Trump fan Tom Cotton to Trump critic Kamala Harris ‚Äî remain hopeful they'll reach a bipartisan conclusion on whether Trump's campaign colluded with Putin & Co. Meanwhile, a legal defense fund has been launched for millionaire Paul Manafort.
Blame it on the A-A-A-A-A-Ambien
Roseanne Barr's apology and Twitter departure didn't last long. She was back with a vengeance Wednesday, slamming her co-stars after earlier blaming her racist tweet on Ambien (cue the jokes). Sanofi, which makes the sleep drug, was like, uh, yeah, racism isn't a side effect. President Trump, meanwhile, asked why ABC has never apologized for the "HORRIBLE statements" said about him (presumably not by Barr ‚Äî he's a fan). Other Roseanne fans said Barr's comments are no worse than Bill Maher's. Too bad for them, the show is unlikely to be picked up elsewhere.
Mexico reminds Trump about funding that wall: 'Not now, not ever'
Trump this week dusted off a crowd-pleasing promise largely missing since his campaign days: Mexico will pay for the wall. That vow, made again Tuesday at a Nashville rally, found swift repudiation from Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. "Mexico will never pay for a wall. Not now, not ever," he tweeted, signed "Mexico (all of us)." On Wednesday, advocates called on U.S. immigration authorities to stop holding transgender migrants seeking asylum in detention centers after a transgender woman died at age 33 while in custody at a facility in New Mexico. Policies regarding asylum seekers, unaccompanied minors crossing the border and families being separated at the border have become conflated in recent weeks. The debate comes as Republican campaign ads tout a tough Trump-style immigration platform (14,000 such ads have run this year).
Hey, Gen X: Get a colon screening
Most people should start colorectal cancer screenings at age 45, not 50, the American Cancer Society said Wednesday after years of those cancers surging among Millennials and Generation X. Experts aren't sure why it's hitting younger, though some blame obesity and diets too heavy on processed meats and alcohol. Not everyone would have to get a colonoscopy (some could do at-home stool tests), but those that do could have an easier time of prepping for it than their parents did.

The European Union (EU) yesterday said it had spent over N44 billion on elections matters in Nigeria since the country's return to civil rule.
EU's Ambassador to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Ketil Karisen, who stated this during the launch of its project on Democratic Governance support in Nigeria, held at the Transcorp Hilton Hotels, Abuja, added that the European body had offered about N44 billion worth of support to democracy, building institutions and engagement of key stakeholders in Nigeria since 1999.
The EU also promised more development partnership towards deepening democratic governance in Nigeria as the 2019 general elections approaches.
The launch of the EU-SDGN project, the envoy explained, was aimed at helping to improve the quality of electoral administration in Nigeria; supporting the National Assembly to effectively discharge its legislative functions in compliance with democratic principles and standards, and supporting political parties to enthrone internal democracy in the country.
Another objective of the project, according to Ambassador Karisen, was to help promote accurate and ethical media coverage, including radio and social media, as well as engage the civil society organisations to contribute towards enhancing the electoral process.
‚ÄúAhead of the 2019 general elections, Nigeria is at a very pivotal moment that allows the country to take important steps towards improving the electoral processes and the EU will continue to partner with the government and the civil society alike with a view to enhancing the quality and participation of Nigerians in these very important processes,‚Äù the ambassador stated.
It will be recalled that the United Nation's Needs Assessment team led by the Representative of the UN Secretary General, Mr. Serge Gakwandi Kubwiana, recently visited INEC to discuss areas of support for the Commission ahead of the 2019 general elections
INEC chairman, Professor Yakubu, noted that the EU and other development partners had made notable contributions in supporting INEC to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the Commission. ‚ÄúThe EU-SDGN support programme 2014-2020, funded through the 11th European Development Fund, is aimed at consolidating democracy in Nigeria,‚Äù the INEC boss said.
Prof Yakubu observed that although the basic indicators for the project derive from the recommendations of the EU election Observation Mission Report on the 2015 general elections, several national stakeholders made significant input to the formulation.
‚ÄúThe strategic areas of intervention in the project, including the support to INEC, were therefore carefully developed in close consultation and collaboration with all relevant election stakeholders‚Äù, he explained.
Professor Yakubu who acknowledged the support and confidence from Nigerians and the International community reposed on the Commission to improve the electoral process, expressed delight that the dedication of the Commission towards entrenching democracy was paying off as INEC had become a reference point to Election Management Bodies in Africa and was open to support other countries develop their own systems.
The INEC chairman said: ‚ÄúThe 2015 general elections was really a turning point not just for Nigeria, but for Africa, and we have been receiving a number of delegations from so many countries in Africa asking to come and understudy Nigeria's INEC.‚Äù

Teachers are being briefed about what to do if terrorists attack.
The nationwide initiative, comes amid fears schools , colleges and universities could be targeted by fanatics.
It was previously only given to businesses thought to be vulnerable to attack, including football clubs and shopping centres, but has now been widened to include schools, colleges and universities.
Thousands of secondary schools and all 154 higher learning institutions are being offered places on the course by the 45 UK police forces.
The training comes after Islamic State urged Muslim parents in France to remove their children from schools and to kill teachers in December 2015.
In March 2012, Mohamed Merah, a jihadist with links to al-Qaeda , killed three children and a teacher outside a Jewish school in south-western France.

Scotland Yard confirmed that Project Argus is a National Counterterrorism Security Office led initiative, which supports ‚Äústrategic leaders in businesses and other organisations to consider the preparedness of their organisations for a terrorist attack‚Äù.
It said in a statement: ‚ÄúAs part of our ongoing response to the threat from violent extremism we have worked with senior representatives from businesses, sports and social venues, as well as other agencies, running table top exercise's to help them evaluate, review and ultimately enhance their security plans. This has recently included educational establishments - particularly targeting higher education.‚Äù
The briefings are primarily being given to teachers in managerial positions responsible for security but are open to all. Forces are offering it to schools on an optional basis.
The Met said the briefings are not a response to any specific threat.

It said previous attacks show that terrorists target busy, well-populated places to ensure that attacks have a maximum impact.
The force added: ‚ÄúThe business, and wider community have an invaluable role to play in our fight against terrorists, violent extremists and other criminals. Their staff are often the first people to spot signs that something is wrong and these table top exercises help organisations to formulate and refine their security and preparedness plans.‚Äù
Scotland Yard has been reviewing security after twelve people were killed and 49 injured when a lorry ploughed through a Berlin Christmas Market last month.
The UK's security level currently stands at ‚Äúsevere‚Äù, meaning a terror attack is highly likely.
Members of the public have been urged to remain vigilant and report to police any concerns.
In this edition of our Bruins roundtable, we asked our B's writers which rookie exceeded their expectations the most in the 2017-18 campaign. Unsurprisingly, Jake DeBrusk's name rang through the answers as the player who began the season on the bubble but who cemented himself into a fan-favorite with his talent and, more importantly, his work ethic.
Check out what Brandon Share-Cohen, Drew Johnson and myself had to say about DeBrusk, and another B's forward.
BSC: Jake DeBrusk
While the results didn't always reflect it, Jake DeBrusk's effort throughout the season was unquestioned and commendable. Before he broke out in the postseason, his impact on the roster was felt from his tireless work ethic and hard-nosed style of play. He was far-and-away the most surprising rookie for me as I wasn't entirely sure he'd make the roster on opening day.
With that said, he went from ‚Äúpossible roster bubble‚Äù to ‚Äúuntouchable trade piece‚Äù in just one season in my mind. He has the potential for 30-goal and 60-70-point seasons in the NHL and his ability to make others around him better shouldn't be understated.
Drew Johnson: Jake DeBrusk, Danton Heinen
DeBrusk was the young gun who exceeded my expectations last season. While he was streaky, he showed that he has the potential to be a consistent goal-scorer in the NHL and will likely be a reliable top-six forward for some time. I expect him to become a permanent member of the second line during the 2018-19 campaign.
Danton Heinen also impressed me. Going into the 2017-18 season, I expected him to push for a roster spot but was 50/50 on whether or not he would stick. Clearly, he did, and I believe he will continue to develop into a solid third-line winger. While I have yet to see consistency from Heien, especially in his two-way game, I expect that will come in time.
Cam Hasbrouck: Jake DeBrusk, Danton Heinen
Just like the two fellas who answered before me, Jake DeBrusk was my first choice for Boston's most surprising rookie. As a first-round draft pick, it may seem silly to be surprised by a strong rookie campaign, but DeBrusk's first season in the big show was exceptional. His 43 points were solid, but those who consistently watched the B's last season know that DeBrusk brought more to the table than pretty stats.
The 21-year-old left a mark with his consistently exceptional effort, his willingness to work in the dirty areas, and his refusal to quit on any play. He quickly transformed from a player with a bright future to becoming a staple in Boston's nightly lineup. Just one season into his career, the youngster should be considered nearly untouchable in trade conversations.
Like Drew, I was also impressed with the level of play that we saw from Danton Heinen at points throughout the season. The former Denver standout wasn't the most consistent producer for the Bruins last season, but when he found his game he was a force. Heinen demonstrated natural offensive abilities and earned his spot as a regular in Boston's competitive lineup. If he can work on those skills and find a way to produce on a regular basis, he could have a very bright future in Boston.
Lastly, I'd like to address a player who was not mentioned in this piece: Charlie McAvoy. While McAvoy had a very strong rookie season, he was left out of this conversation because he was the Bruins rookie to watch coming into the season. So while he did have a big impact on Boston's success this season, it wasn't necessarily a surprise to any of our writers, so hold the riots.
After missing out on John Tavares, the Bruins aren't quite where they want to be entering the 2018-19 season in the powerhouse Atlantic Division. In all likelihood, the Bruins still have some moves to make this offseason. But assuming the players mentioned above remain in black and gold, they'll be worth keeping a close eye on right from the start of camp this fall.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress on Friday escalated a campaign against U.S. law enforcement agencies over their probe of Trump's ties to Russia, releasing a disputed memo that the FBI warned was misleading and inaccurate.
The previously classified document, written by Republicans on the House of Representatives intelligence committee, alleges that the federal probe of potential collusion between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia was a product of political bias against Trump at the FBI and Justice Department.
Ignoring a plea from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Trump approved the memo's release without redactions, deepening an extraordinary breach between the president and senior law enforcement officials over a probe that has dogged him during his first year in office.
Democrats said the four-page memo mischaracterizes highly sensitive classified information and was intended to undermine Special Counsel Robert Mueller's criminal probe into the Russia matter launched in May 2017 that grew out of an earlier FBI investigation. They warned Trump against using it as a pretext to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who hired Mueller and oversees the investigation, or Mueller himself.
Mueller also is examining whether Trump has committed obstruction of justice in trying to thwart the Russia probe.
Asked by reporters whether the memo made him more likely to fire Rosenstein or whether he had confidence in him, Trump replied, ‚ÄúYou figure that one out.‚Äù Dismissing Rosenstein would likely ignite a huge political firestorm, as his firing of FBI chief James Comey did last year.
A White House official later said there have been no discussions about firing Rosenstein.
When asked about the potential dismissal of Rosenstein, White House press spokesman Raj Shah told CNN late on Friday that there would be ‚Äúno changes‚Äù at the Justice Department.
‚ÄúWe fully expect Rod Rosenstein to continue on as the deputy attorney general,‚Äù he said.
The memo alleges that the Federal Bureau of Investigation concealed the Democratic ties of a source the agency used to justify surveillance on Carter Page, a former Trump campaign advisor with ties to Russia. The memo revealed the names of senior FBI and Justice Department officials including Rosenstein who it said had signed off on this.
‚ÄúI think it's a disgrace what's happening in our country,‚Äù Trump told reporters when asked about the memo, adding that ‚Äúa lot of people should be ashamed of themselves.‚Äù
Some lawmakers accused Trump of playing into the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin after, as Republican Senator John McCain put it, Russia ‚Äúengaged in an elaborate plot to interfere in an American election and undermine our democracy.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf we continue to undermine our own rule of law, we are doing Putin's job for him,‚Äù McCain, who is being treated for brain cancer, said in a statement.
Mueller's probe has led to guilty pleas by two of Trump's foreign policy advisers to charges of lying to the FBI, and indictments of former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Manafort's business partner Rick Gates.
Trump has called the investigation a ‚Äúwitch hunt,‚Äù denying any collusion with Russia or obstruction of justice. Moscow has denied any election meddling.

‚ÄòSACRED INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS'
In a swipe at U.S. law enforcement leaders on Twitter hours before the memo's release, Trump said, ‚ÄúThe top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago.‚Äù
It was his latest attack on top law enforcement officials. Trump fired Comey last May as the FBI pursued the Russia probe, leading to Mueller's appointment by Rosenstein.
The FBI on Wednesday had expressed ‚Äúgrave concerns about material omissions of fact‚Äù in the document and urged that it not be made public. Writing on Twitter, Comey branded the memo ‚Äúdishonest and misleading.‚Äù
FBI Director Christopher Wray sent a message to bureau employees apparently aimed at boosting morale after the memo's release. ‚ÄúI stand by our shared determination to do our work independently and by the book,‚Äù Wray said in the message, excerpts of which were seen by Reuters.

The memo was commissioned by the Republican chairman of the House intelligence panel, Devin Nunes. He said it laid bare ‚Äúserious violations of the public trust, and the American people have a right to know when officials in crucial institutions are abusing their authority for political purposes.‚Äù
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, criticized by Trump for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, offered praise for Rosenstein as well as the department's No. 3 official Rachel Brand on Friday, saying they ‚Äúrepresent the kind of quality and leadership that we want in the department.‚Äù
The memo focused on court-approved surveillance of Page, the former campaign advisor, and said the FBI used a source who was strongly biased against Trump, former British spy Christopher Steele, to justify the action.
It alleged that a dossier of alleged Trump-Russia contacts compiled by Steele, and funded in part by U.S. Democrats, formed an ‚Äúessential part‚Äù of requests to a special court to be allowed to conduct electronic surveillance on Page that began in October 2016.
It said the initial application and subsequent renewal applications, signed off on by various senior Justice Department officials, did not mention the link between Steele and the Democrats. It also portrayed Steele as ‚Äúpassionate‚Äù about Trump not becoming president.
Despite the memo's charges, neither the focus on Page nor the FBI's investigation of Trump-Russia ties began with the Steele dossier. Page came to the FBI's attention as early as 2013, when he met in New York with Russians who were officers of the Kremlin's foreign intelligence service, sources have said.
The memo acknowledges that the FBI counterintelligence investigation began in July 2016, three months before the request for electronic surveillance on Page, as a result of the activities of another Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos.
Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat in May 2016 that Russia had political dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, information Australian officials passed to the U.S. government, the New York Times reported in December.
‚ÄúThe selective release and politicization of classified information sets a terrible precedent and will do long-term damage to the Intelligence Community and our law enforcement agencies,‚Äù House intelligence committee Democrats said in a statement.
They said they hoped the panel would vote on Monday to release their own memo responding to the allegations. Shah, the White House spokesman, told CNN Trump ‚Äúwould be inclined‚Äù to let that memo be released if it clears a security and legal review.

It's going to be a snowy weekend in London.
Environment Canada says a low pressure system currently over the Dakotas is forecast to track across Georgian Bay early Sunday and into southern Quebec by evening, prompting a special weather statement for London-Middlesex.
READ MORE: Morning commute takes west-end Londoners two hours on slippery, snowy roads
The national weather reporting agency says although it's a relatively weak system, it will absorb some moisture from the Great Lakes on Saturday night and Sunday.
Some patchy light snow will develop Saturday, but the agency says more snow is expected Saturday night and Sunday.
Snowfall amounts will not be heavy, but total weekend amounts are expected to reach eight to 12 centimeters.
READ MORE: Middlesex-London Health Unit issues cold weather alert ahead of frigid weekend
On top of the snow, Environment Canada says a sharp Arctic cold front will sweep across the region Sunday afternoon. The sudden drop in temperature from near the freezing mark may cause snow-covered roads to quickly turn to ice late Sunday afternoon.
Motorists are reminded to give themselves extra time to reach their destination whenever snow is on the ground, but are advised to be particularly cautious tomorrow given the weather alert.
Also included in the statement are Parkhill, Strathroy and Komoka.
People with limited mobility encounter obstacles on a daily basis.
But there's an additional obstacle in the summer season: outdoor terraces, many of which are not wheelchair accessible.
‚ÄúI'm kind of insulted, sort of feel invisible,‚Äù said Bill Lavery, who has multiple sclerosis and relies on a scooter to get around.
On Monday, Lavery tried to meet friends at a popular pub on St-Laurent Boulevard.
With the Mural Festival underway, a temporary terrace had been installed.
READ MORE: Montrealer with MS calling on Health Canada to approve breakthrough drug Ocrevus
It has no access for people with limited mobility and blocks the usual entrance to the restaurant.
Lavery asked to speak to the manager.
‚ÄúHe told me that it wasn't their fault, that it was the city's fault for not enforcing the rule,‚Äù Lavery said.
According to city bylaws, the rules for temporary festival terraces are more lenient than for permanent ones.

Still, if a business was wheelchair accessible before the festival started, it must remain so.
Montreal lawyer Julius Grey says there is no constitutional protection that guarantees universal accessibility for people with physical disabilities.
‚ÄúI don't think the law says that every single place must be accessible at all times, because that would create a straight-jacket,‚Äù Grey told Global News. ‚ÄúThere would be a lot of unusable places and I don't think that was the intention.‚Äù
Still, some establishments are making an effort to remedy this problem.
READ MORE: Accessibility activists demonstrate on Montreal metro's 50th birthday
On Wednesday, Lavery made a reservation at the ITHQ restaurant on St. Denis Boulevard.
He was told that, while the terrace is not presently wheelchair accessible, a ramp will be installed in the coming days.
‚ÄúI'm glad to hear it,‚Äù Lavery said. ‚ÄúHe said that they hadn't thought of it before and that they just opened the terrace. And apparently it came to light that they needed to change it. So they took steps to take care of that.‚Äù
It's a small victory for Lavery and others with physical disabilities, but there's still a ways to go.
‚ÄúThere's no reason that these things can't be accommodated,‚Äù Lavery said. ‚ÄúSomeone just has to think a little bit ahead.‚Äù
Lavery hopes that greater attention will be paid to wheelchair accessibility in the years to come.
The six-year-old girl, who was allegedly raped and strangulated in Cuttack district on Monday, has gone into a coma.The SCB Medical College and Hospital has confirmed to News18 that the victim is now comatose.The girl, who suffered deep injuries in her head, face, neck, chest and private parts, was rescued from inside a school campus near her house in Jagannathpur village of Salepur. The girl is on life support system, and a team of doctors drawn from various departments are attending her round-the-clock.Meanwhile, the accused of the same village, arrested on Monday, was produced before a local court on Tuesday and remanded in jail custody, police said.(With PTI Inputs)
Neymar has writhed stuff, July 3
Neymar's antics are par for the course in a great tradition of childish behaviour demonstrated by Brazilian soccer players.
Remember Rivaldo in 2002? He should have won an Oscar for his performance.
How to get rid of this type of embarrassing behaviour? Easy! Roll over once ‚Äî acceptable. Roll over twice ‚Äî yellow card. Roll over three times or more, √† la Neymar ‚Äî straight red.
If this were the case, Brazil wouldn't be able to field a full team if they qualify for the final.
In addition to the line-up being named for the 2018 Pan Pacific Championships, the Japanese Swimming Federation also revealed its roster selections for the 2018 Asian Games taking place in Indonesia beginning August 18th. With most of the Pan Pac roster also named to the Asian Games, Japan's elite swimmers will jump from one international competition to the next with little training time in between.
The Asian Games take place every 4 years and is taken very seriously by the athletes involved. Swimming is just one of nearly 50 sports contested over the 2-week affair, with big guns China and Japan duking it out the entire time. At the 2014 edition of the Games, the 2 nations set themselves apart from the competition big-time in the medal table, with China collecting 47 overall to Japan's close 46. In terms of golds, however, China snagged an impressive 22 to Japan's 12.
Additionally of note, since the inception of the MVP award across all sports at the quadrennial event back in 1998, a swimmer has won it 3 times, including Kosuke Kitajima in 2002, Park Tae Hwan in 2006 and Kosuke Hagino in 2014.
2014 Asian Games gold medalist Junya Koga was originally named to his nation's roster for the 2018 but has been removed due to a positive doping test, as reported earlier this month.

Hong Kong-Hong Kong launched a landmark bill to ban its ivory trade Wednesday, describing it as an effort to ‚Äúeradicate‚Äù the illegal poaching of elephants. The southern Chinese city is a major hub for ivory sales and announced last year that it would ban the import and export of the goods, but later clarified it would only completely abolish the trade by 2021.
Critics say authorities are dragging their feet and lagging behind China, where officials in December pledged to halt the enterprise by the end of 2017.
A new amendment to the Protection of Endangered Species of Animals and Plants ordinance was presented to lawmakers Wednesday, designed to toughen regulations and ‚Äúphase out the local ivory trade‚Äù, but said it would be a five-year process.
Environment minister Wong Kam-sing said the city must respond to the demands of the international community as he formally introduced the bill at the legislative council Wednesday. The trade would ‚Äúfully come to a close‚Äù by 2021, he added. A frontline park ranger from the Democratic Republic of Congo last week delivered emotional testimony to legislators, describing the violent nature of the trade.
Garamba National Park manager Erik Mararv said he and his team were ambushed by poachers near an elephant carcass ‚Äúwith its face hacked off‚Äù last year, leading to the deaths of three rangers.
He went on to argue that Hong Kong should not compensate its own ivory traders as it could further encourage the violent industry.
Angry sellers in Hong Kong are demanding payback, claiming they have been unable to offload much of their remaining stock since the market diminished following an international ban nearly three decades ago.
The global trade in elephant ivory, with rare exceptions, has been outlawed since 1989 after populations of the African giants dropped from millions in the mid-20th century to around 600,000 by the end of the 1980s. There are now believed to be some 415,000.
Lawmaker Regina Ip on Wednesday raised the question of compensation for traders, but Wong said the government would not buy up the ivory as the city was ‚Äúdetermined‚Äù to close down the market.
African ivory is highly sought after in China, where it is seen as a status symbol, and where elephant tusks are used in traditional medicine or to make ornaments.
One of the busiest search and rescue teams in the country is looking for new recruits.
North Shore Rescue (NSR) is looking for roughly a dozen new members to fill spots that need to be filled due to retirement and to help cope with the growing demand of rescues performed in the North Shore mountains.
NSR is a volunteer mountain search and rescue team based in Vancouver and it's not a large crew. It's comprised of 40 active members, who do the field work and 20 resource people who provide support.
READ MORE: North Shore Rescue needs new recruits following busiest year
Over the last month, the team was kept busy rescuing lost hikers, retrieving skiers caught in avalanches and locating missing snowshoers.
Due to the situations the NSR team faces with each rescue, finding candidates who are physically fit and have the necessary mountain skills and first aid training can be tricky.
Anyone interested in applying for NSR needs to fill out their online application by April 18. The new online application form must be filled out in addition to sending your resume and cover letter by email.

ABC/Fred LeeCheers to Lady Gaga! According to celebrity site The Blast, the singer may be launching a new signature wine.
Reps for Gaga have reportedly filed the necessary paperwork to trademark two wines: Joanne Trattoria Vino Blanco and Joanne Trattoria Vino Rosso.
Joanne Trattoria is the New York City restaurant owned by Gaga's father, Joe Germanotta. The eatery, as well as Gaga's latest album, was named after Gaga's late aunt.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that a new NAFTA trade deal could be completed quickly, as ministers from Canada, Mexico and the United States prepared to meet later in the day to try to work out their differences and hash out an agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a tree planting ceremony with French President Emmanuel Macron on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S., April 23, 2018.
‚ÄúNAFTA, as you know, is moving along. They (Mexico) have an election coming up very soon. And it will be interesting to see what happens with that election,‚Äù Trump said at a cabinet meeting briefly attended by reporters.
‚ÄúBut we're doing very nicely with NAFTA. I could make a deal really quickly, but I'm not sure that's in the best interests of the United States. But we'll see what happens,‚Äù he added.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo are pressing for a quick deal to avoid clashing with Mexico's July 1 presidential election. That will entail overcoming major differences on several U.S. demands.
Guajardo said that flexibility will be needed to reach an agreement on a revamped North American Free Trade Agreement deal.
He also underscored that Mexico would not accept any U.S. tariffs on aluminium or steel, saying that a revised NAFTA should serve to settle the issue with its northern neighbour.
Asked by reporters if a deal was imminent, Guajardo said: ‚ÄúAny day that you start (to) walk towards a goal nobody can guarantee that you will achieve it, (it) depends on the commitment and flexibilities around the table.‚Äù
Negotiators have said a new NAFTA could be possible by early May, and officials hailed progress on the key issue of new automotive sector rules last week.
‚ÄúIn the coming 10 days we can really have a new agreement in principle,‚Äù said Moises Kalach, head of the international negotiating arm of the CCE business lobby, which represents the Mexican private sector at the NAFTA talks.
The three sides still need to iron out differences on content rules for autos, dispute resolution mechanisms and other issues.
‚ÄúAs soon as there is political will from the American government to go for a final deal, I think we can close this,‚Äù Kalach told Mexican radio. ‚ÄúWe've had all our (negotiating) teams in Washington for two weeks and we will continue working all this week, the weekend and into next week.‚Äù
Guajardo also said there was no need for a separate deal with the United States on steel and aluminium by May 1 when the current exemption on U.S. tariffs expires.
‚ÄúI think whatever we do has to take into account the kind of commitment that we're going to do in NAFTA, and definitely, Mexico has been very clear: we will not accept any type of restrictions in aluminium or steel,‚Äù he said.
Last month, Trump pressed ahead with import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent for aluminium but exempted Canada and Mexico and offered the possibility of excluding other allies.
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India said on Tuesday that 39 Indians, who were believed to have been kidnapped by militants in Iraq in 2014, had been confirmed dead after their bodies were found.

The bodies were recovered from a mass grave and DNA tests had confirmed them to be the construction workers who went missing from the Iraqi city of Mosul, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj told parliament.
‚ÄúWith full proof I can say these 39 are dead,‚Äù the minister said. The government had for years said it would only declare the men dead once it had full evidence.

‚ÄúPrince of Pot‚Äù claims smoking marijuana makes people better drivers
Marc Emery told Global's Jeff McArthur Monday on The Morning Show that he smokes and drives every day and maintains he has never been in a car accident. ‚ÄúRemember, pot doesn't impair you,‚Äù Emery said. ‚ÄúThis idea, one of the many myths I have to clear out in the next 18 months, is that pots impairs you.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria's capital Vienna once again defended its position as the city offering the best quality of life in the world, while Iraq's capital Baghdad remains the worst in an annual survey from consulting firm Mercer.

Mercer's survey of 231 cities helps companies and organisations determine compensation and hardship allowances for international staff. Its criteria include political stability, health care, education, crime, recreation and transport.
Europe has eight of the world's top 10 most pleasant cities: Germany and Switzerland each have three cities in the top 10, while New Zealand, Canada and Australia each have one.
With a population of 1.8 million, Vienna topped the survey for the ninth year in a row, boasting a vibrant cultural scene, comprehensive healthcare and moderate housing costs.
Vienna is followed by Switzerland's Zurich and then New Zealand's Auckland and Germany's Munich in joint third.
Vancouver, ranked fifth, offers the best quality of living in North America. Singapore at 25 and Montevideo at 77 topped the Asian and Latin American places. The best African entry on the list was South Africa's Durban in 89th place.

A year before Britain is expected to leave the European Union, its highest ranked city, London, fell one rank to 41 in an annual comparison.
‚ÄúCities in the UK continue to rank highly for quality of living, and remain attractive destinations for multinationals and their employees,‚Äù said Kate Fitzpatrick, Mercer's Global Mobility Practice Leader for Britain and Ireland.

Over the past 20 years, living standards increased the most in some eastern European cities such as Sarajevo, now at 159, and Bratislava, at 80, the report said.
‚ÄúAs a result of increased living standards, a competitive labour market and talent availability, many of these cities have started attracting multinational businesses setting up new operations,‚Äù said Martine Ferland, President Europe and Pacific.
Baghdad has been at the bottom of the list for a decade now. Waves of sectarian violence have swept through the city since the American-led invasion in 2003.
Yemen's capital Sanaa, devastated by conflict, ranked two places above Baghdad, and Syria's Damascus, seven years into a civil war, ranked six places above Iraq's capital.
The end of the 2017-2018 school year will mean the end of Villa Maria High School's private music school. Low enrollment was one of the reasons that led them to the decision.
‚ÄúThere were only 13 new students enrolled in the private music school this year in secondary 1,‚Äù the school said in an email to Global News. ‚ÄúThat is the smallest cohort ever in the history of the school.‚Äù

The closure means 20 teachers will lose their jobs. However, students at the school will still be offered opportunities to learn and practice music.
‚ÄúWe are keeping the music orchestra option, which is very popular with parents and students alike,‚Äù the school said. ‚ÄúIt is available to all students in secondary 1 through 5 in the regular curriculum.‚Äù

Welcome back, true believers! With last week's episode focusing on a Watchdog turned Inhuman with the ability to self combust, the gang unfortunately had Director Mace taken right from under their noses by the militant organization. With Mace and May both in the clutches of Radcliffe and company, the team mounts a counteroffensive in order to retrieve their fallen comrades. ‚ÄúThe Man Behind the Shield‚Äù works on two levels, managing to give us a nice breezy adventure in the present while also recollecting a fun and humor-filled romp through the past, with young Coulson and May bounding through a mission against the Russians. While most of the episode is solid, it's in the ending that big questions are laid bare, ones that may lead to huge ramifications for the season. Needless to say, while not a perfect episode,‚ÄúThe Man Behind the Shield‚Äù plays up the strengths of what makes Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. such an enjoyable show ‚Äî when it wants to be.
The episode takes us into a deep dive into technological by having the team explore the ‚ÄúFramework,‚Äù a virtual reality program that was originally created by Fitz and Radcliffe as training software. Of course, Radcliffe ‚Äî much like with the LMDs ‚Äî has decided to use the system for more nefarious reasons, such as keeping Agent May a prisoner. Personally, I would like us to see a bit more focus placed on the Darkhold, the mysterious evil book that seemed to be the deus ex machina for the start of Season 4. While its presence is still hinted at from time to time, we haven't seen it actually do much since the latter half of the season, merely granting Aida (and potentially the other LMDs) the ability to become more and more human as time marches forward. Understandably, with more of a focus on technology rather than the supernatural, I suppose the Darkhold would need to take a back seat, but still, it would be nice to see some magic seep its way into the series once again considering how big the Darkhold is in the Marvel Universe of the comics.
The gang manages to track down what appears to be a board created by Anton Ivanov, the apparent superior to the Watchdogs (I mostly say ‚Äúapparent‚Äù because there could always be a twist thrown in later on as to the true identity of their leader). While Anton's character doesn't have the personality of someone like Ward or Mr. Hyde, his motivation is at least an interesting one. Outside of simply trying to eradicate the alien influence on the planet that was somewhat ushered in by the reveal of the Avengers, he also believes that the impetus for these perceived threats is none other than Phil Coulson himself. The idea that Phil is linked to, or potentially the origin of, all of these different super-powered events makes sense in a sort of conspiracy theory kind of way, and that's definitely where Anton's mindspace is at the time. Honestly though, Ivanov would have made for a much better villain had he simply been more than a hired goon with a thick Russian accent. A villain can still be terrifying if they also have a personality attached to them ‚Äî just look at Freddy Krueger as an example. Ivanov wouldn't necessarily need to be invading people's' dreams while dishing out wisecracks, but at this point, it would be a welcome trait.
So when the episode takes us to a blast from the past in the adventures of younger Coulson and May, it's a welcome respite. That's not to say that the events in the present were bad by any stretch, just that seeing Clark Gregg and Ming-Na Wen shoot barbs at one another makes for a really fun scene. While the flashbacks don't exactly offer a ton of new information to the proceedings, it's a nice little reflection on the chemistry between these two actors and the strength of the series' humor. Agent May would have fit right in into the movies proper had she been a side character alongside Fury and Maria Hill. Hopefully in the future of the series we can get some more episodes that focus in more on the fantastic exchanges of these characters, though I do find that the season premieres and finales do ramp up the humor of the Agents.
As Mace attempts to escape again and again, failing each time due to his lack of super strength, the team manages to pinpoint his location and makes a flashy rescue attempt. Daisy takes out Ivanov with a display of her powers and martial arts prowess, Mack tears through a ton of Watchdogs with a combination of fists and his shotgun axe, and the gang manages to seemingly rescue their director from the clutches of the Watchdogs. As Fitz and Simmons watch Coulson, Mace, Daisy, and Mack return to their headquarters, the LMD detector they installed near the entrance alerts them that not just one or two of their friends have been compromised, but all four of our returning heroes are in fact Life Model Decoys! The episode ends with Fitz and Simmons reeling in horror while ‚ÄúFake Coulson‚Äù turns on the once deactivated May LMD, promising some more robot shenanigans coming down the pike.
Managing to revel in its technology focus and humor, the hour also delivers some nice surprises along the way. This episode was a strong showing for the series' latter half of Season 4, which has been one of its best if I do say so myself, in that it manages to highlight all of S.H.I.E.L.D.‚Äòs the best assets.

An Indian delegation is here to discuss a possible joint venture to operate Sri Lanka's loss-making Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport in Hambantota, the government said today.The USD 210 million facility, 241 km south-east of Sri Lanka's capital city, Colombo, is dubbed the "world's emptiest airport" due to a lack of flights.The only international flight operating from there was halted in May due to recurrent losses and flight safety issues.Sri Lankan Deputy Minister of Transport Ashok Abeysinghe stated this in Parliament while answering an Opposition query on whether the Mattala airport, which was funded by China, would be sold outright.Abeysinghe said India has expressed willingness to operate the airport as a Sri Lanka-India joint venture."Despite making losses the airport would never be sold," he said.Mattala airport, named after former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, was a China-supported infrastructure project in his home district of Hambantota. The airport was officially opened in March 2013.The airport has the capacity to handle one million passengers a year and is expected to handle five million passengers, 50,000 tonnes of cargo and 6,250 air traffic operations per annum by 2028.The government in 2017 invited investors to turn the airport into a profit-sharing joint venture. However no proposals were received to operate, manage and maintain the airport.The seaport built in Hambantota, another Rajapaksa pet project, has been leased to China to set off Chinese loans as equity. The Rajapaksa-led Opposition has called the Hambantota seaport deal a sell-out of national assets to China.
In his first season running a team and as the youngest head coach in NFL history, the Los Angeles Rams' Sean McVay won The Associated Press 2017 NFL Coach of the Year award.
Not to be outdone, his players, Todd Gurley II and Aaron Donald, won the Offensive and Defensive Player of the Year awards, respectively -- capping a remarkable turnaround season for the Rams.
McVay, who turned 32 on Jan. 24, led the Rams to an 11-5 record, a seven-game improvement from the mark they managed the previous season.
The Rams won their first NFC West title since 2003, and second-year quarterback Jared Goff improved exponentially under McVay's guidance.
Editor's Picks As Aaron Donald's price climbs, so might his desire to be with Rams Defensive Player of the Year is another feather in Aaron Donald's cap as he seeks a new deal, but the Rams' bright future helps their side of things.
Saints used patience, hustle to land Rookie of the Year winners The Saints were smart to wait for Marshon Lattimore and bold when they traded up for Alvin Kamara, and they swept the NFL rookie honors on Saturday.
Chargers WR Keenan Allen wins Comeback Player of Year Sidelined for nearly all of last season with a torn ACL, Keenan Allen's bounce-back Pro Bowl season made him the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year. 2 Related
"What it means is we had a good season that I think we can build on,'' McVay said. "But you have to earn it every single day. It's a very humbling league.''
McVay ran away with the voting by a nationwide panel of 50 media members who regularly cover the league. He drew 35 votes to 11 for Minnesota's Mike Zimmer. Doug Marrone of Jacksonville received two votes, while the Super Bowl coaches, Philadelphia's Doug Pederson and New England's Bill Belichick, each got one.
Gurley's 1,305 rushing yards, 13 rushing touchdowns and six TD receptions during the Rams' campaign earned him top offensive honors for the year. The third-year running back was the AP's top offensive rookie in 2015, then had a mediocre second season.
Gurley got 37 votes, which put him far ahead of Pittsburgh receiver Antonio Brown, who received eight votes. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady got four and Houston receiver DeAndre Hopkins had one.
"It just tells you the type of players we have on the team. We all help each other out, absolutely. We have some talent, but we're nothing without the whole nine yards and everybody together," Gurley said.
Only two other Rams players have ever won the offensive player award -- Eric Dickerson (one) and Marshall Faulk (three).
Donald, Gurley's teammate, became the first pure defensive tackle to win the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award since 1999
Often the province of outside pass-rushers and backs, Donald broke the trend by earning 23 votes from the 50-member panel.
"Words can't express what I'm feeling right now," Donald said. "Trying to hold back the tears."
Warren Sapp of Tampa Bay was the previous tackle to win the award.
"That's one of the best to ever do it, so for my name to be next to that guy's name is beyond a blessing," Donald said. "My dad's been telling me since I was 12 years old working out in my basement trying to work to this point, all the work paid off. You put the body of work in, it's going to pay off for you."
Other tackles to win the award have been Hall of Famers Joe Greene and Cortez Kennedy.
While the Rams' defense didn't rank highly in league stats, Donald was a force. The 2014 top defensive rookie spent 2017 destroying blockers, leading all players at his position with 11 sacks and had 58 pressures while usually being double-teamed.
Donald enters the final year of his rookie contract. He sat out last summer in hopes of getting a new deal and did not return in time for the season opener.
Defensive end Calais Campbell, in his first season with the Jaguars, was second with 17 votes. Arizona's Chandler Jones got five.
The Rams' hat trick of awards was not unprecedented. In 2003, Baltimore's Ray Lewis was top defensive player, Jamal Lewis won the best offensive player, and Terrell Suggs was Defensive Rookie of the Year. And in 1999, the St. Louis Rams had three award winners: Kurt Warner (MVP), Marshall Faulk (Offensive Player) and Dick Vermeil (Coach).
Saints' Kamara, Lattimore win rookie honors
The future is bright in the Big Easy as New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara and cornerback Marshon Lattimore won the top rookie awards.
In a year featuring outstanding rookie running backs, Kamara, third-round draft pick out of Tennessee, beat another third-rounder, Kansas City's Kareem Hunt, for the Offensive Rookie of the Year award.
Kamara, selected 19 spots ahead of Hunt, received 28 votes to 21 for Hunt. Houston rookie quarterback Deshaun Watson, despite playing in only seven games before a season-ending knee injury, got the other vote.
"You get caught up in the season, you don't really get time to pat yourself on the back,'' Kamara said. "But when the season is over you realize what you've done. I've kind of had to time to look back and say, I made some history this season.''
Kamara shared duties with veteran Mark Ingram as the Saints won the NFC South with an 11-5 record. He rushed for 728 yards with a 6.1-yard average and scored eight times. He also caught 81 passes for 826 yards, with 5 touchdowns.
No rookie had more impact on his NFL team this season than Lattimore, who won the 2017 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year.
The 11th overall draft pick and first from his position selected, Lattimore was a shutdown defender for the Saints.
The Ohio State product had five interceptions and 18 passes defensed in 13 games, was a sure tackler and, by midseason, was someone opposing quarterbacks tended to avoid.
He missed three games, one because of a concussion and two with an ankle injury.
Lattimore got 45 votes, far ahead of Buffalo Bills CB Tre'Davious White with four and San Francisco 49ers LB Reuben Foster with one.
The Saints are the first team to sweep the Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year awards since the 1967 Lions with Mel Farr and Lem Barney.
Chargers' Allen named comeback player
Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen returned from two devastating injuries to win the 2017 NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award.
Allen missed half of the 2015 season with a kidney issue, then was lost in the 2016 season opener with a torn right ACL.
There were questions about whether Allen would ever play at a high level again. He answered those emphatically this season with the best year of his career. Allen caught 102 passes for 1,393 yards and 6 touchdowns. He was targeted 159 times, nearly 10 per game.
That performance earned him 28 votes. He easily outdistanced Minnesota quarterback Case Keenum, who had eight.
Kuechly honored with sportsmanship award
Carolina Panthers linebacker Luke Kuechly has won the 2017 Art Rooney Sportsmanship Award.
The award recognizes the NFL player who best demonstrates the qualities of outstanding sportsmanship on the playing field, including fair play, respect for opponents and integrity in competition.
The award was founded in 2014 in honor of the late founding owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pro Football Hall of Famer Art Rooney Sr. Kuechly will receive a $25,000 donation from the NFL Foundation to a charity of his choice.
Shurmur tabbed top assistant coach
Pat Shurmur heads to his new job as coach of the New York Giants with a prize. For his work as offensive coordinator with the Minnesota Vikings, Shurmur has won the 2017 NFL Assistant Coach of the Year award.
With a backup quarterback, Keenum, and without prized rookie running back Dalvin Cook for most of the year, Shurmur helped Minnesota go 13-3 and win the NFC North with a strong attack.
The Vikings ranked 11th overall in offense, doing so without a true star. Shurmur -- a former head coach at Cleveland -- earned 24¬Ω votes, as he outdistanced New Orleans defensive coordinator Dennis Allen, New England DC Matt Patricia, and Los Angeles Rams DC Wade Phillips, who all got four votes.

Midland man charged with dealing meth

A Midland man accused of dealing methamphetamine at a local gas station earlier this month remains jailed while his case proceeds through court.
Stephan Carl Ohsowski, 26, faces three counts of second-offense delivery or manufacture of meth, as well as a habitual second offender notice.
He was arraigned on the charges on May 24. Midland County District Court Magistrate Gerald Ladwig set bond at $500,000 cash or surety.
The charges arise from an investigation that began when a Midland Police officer patrolling in the area of South Saginaw Road and Washington Street early in the morning on May 5 noticed three people standing by a dark blue Blazer at a gas station. When they noticed the officer, one of the group walked away, an affidavit filed in the case states.
The Blazer left the gas station, and the officer conducted a traffic stop for a defective muffler. Another officer used a police K9 to sniff the Blazer, and the dog indicated drugs were present.
After establishing the driver had a medical marijuana card, it was discovered he was driving without proof of insurance. That led to the Blazer being towed, which also resulted in officers conducting an inventory of the items inside the vehicle.
Inside a purse, officers found methamphetamine. The passenger in the vehicle also was found to have meth in her possession.
The affidavit states the passenger told officers she had purchased the drugs from the man who walked away from the Blazer at the gas station. Police used that information to obtain a search warrant for the Eastlawn Drive apartment the man lived in.
Multiple items, including a cellphone, two spoons with residue, multiple syringes and one syringe containing meth, were confiscated, the affidavit states.
The case is set for a June 12 preliminary examination before Midland County District Court Judge Michael D. Carpenter.

Pandora announced today it has appointed Robert Lynch as its new president and CEO.
Lynch was the founding CEO of Dish's Sling TV, previous to the move. He will also become a member of Pandora's board of directors, along with Snap Inc.'s Michael Lynton.
Naveen Chopra was serving as Pandora's interim CEO after Tim Westergren, Pandora's former CEO, announced he was stepping down from all official positions.
Lynch's new position comes just as Pandora has launched a rebranding effort to focus on conversion of free users to paying customers. The company started to see a climb this year in Q2 for its efforts, topping revenue targets and closing at 4.86 million total paid subscribers, sending shares up more than 7 percent in extended trading.
Pandora has seen a steady decline in the number of active users since 2014, when about 81.5 million people were actively using the service on a monthly basis. That number now stands at 76 million (compare that to Spotify's 140 million active monthly users, 50 million of whom are paying customers).
The addition of Lynch and board inclusion of Lynton, who ran Sony Pictures before joining Snap, could signal Pandora is thinking about getting into video in the future.
Lynch will begin his new appointment on September 18, 2017.

Here's an article from the Philadelphia Inquirer (thanks to several readers for calling this situation to my attention). Click on the screenshot to read the piece about PSU (Pennsylvania State University) and its new decision.
What happened? Here's the skinny:
A backpacking trip in the Rothrock State Forest and day hikes in the Laurel Highlands and Shenandoah National Park in Virginia were among the Penn State Outing Club's 2018 spring-term events. After this weekend, though, the 98-year-old organization has nothing on its calendar, and unless things change, it won't. The Outing Club isn't allowed to go outside anymore. According to an announcement posted by the club on its website last week, the university will not allow the club to organize and run outdoor, student-led trips starting next semester. ‚ÄúThis is a result,‚Äù the announcement said, ‚Äúof an assessment of risk management by the university that determined that the types of activities in which PSOC engages are above the university's threshold of acceptable risk for recognized student organizations.‚Äù After a two-month review that did not include consultation with student Outing Club leaders, the university's offices of Student Affairs and Risk Management made the determination that the hiking, canoeing, kayaking, trail building and camping activities the student-led club has long engaged in are too risky. The club is one of the oldest entirely student-run organizations at Penn State. . . . The other two outdoor recreation organizations, the Nittany Grotto Caving Club and the Nittany Divers SCUBA Club, were also judged too risky and directed to end trip offerings. Club sports that passed the risk review include the Archery Club, Boxing Club, Alpine Ski Racing Club and Rifle Club.
Note that the decision didn't involve any of the students, and, worse, the University won't even tell the students why they nixed the outings. Is it getting more dangerous out there? I suspect not.
‚ÄúStudent safety in any activity is our primary focus,‚Äù Lisa Powers, a Penn State University spokeswoman, said in an email response to questions about the school's assessment. Ms. Powers said the university conducted reviews of all campus recreation-supported student groups ‚Äî 76 sport and three outdoor recreation organizations ‚Äî to evaluate student safety risks and produce assessment reports. She declined to provide a copy of the assessment report for the Outing Club, saying it is not a public document.
This is ludicrous and embarrassing, especially in view of PSU's refusal to consult with the clubs and come clean about its decision.
Of course none of us know what really happened, but I think this is a result of universities increasingly deciding they really have to act in loco parentis since students are increasingly becoming consumers; the university thinks that the consumers must be safe. In this case, however, the University‚Äî probably afraid of being sued‚Äîmade the decision against the wishes of the students. The University is, in effect, acting as a Big Helicopter Parent, trying to shield its charges from all possible harm.
Most of us older folk have noticed this on a parental scale. Kids aren't allowed to play on their own anymore‚Äînot without a parent watching. When I got home from grade school, or wanted to do stuff on the weekend, I'd just get on my bike and ride off on my own, sometimes not even telling my parents where I was going. That was when I was ten years old or so. Everybody played unsupervised then, but it's unthinkable now, despite children actually being safer in today's world. So if the world is safer, what is Penn State's beef? Why, in a safer world, do colleges want even more supervision? You tell me.
Regardless, the students don't like it one bit:
On a Penn State Reddit site, and the Outing Club's Facebook page, reports of the university's decision to shut down the club's outings were derided by many as hypocritical. Some of more than 80 Reddit posters wondered if the school will shut down its highly ranked men's and women's rugby teams, full-contact club street hockey, and even football because they were risky and potentially injurious.
The Huawei P20 lineup is all but out in various leaks and renders over the past few weeks. The P20 Pro, is supposedly going to have a three-camera system on the back and an expected price of around ‚Ç¨899 (approx Rs 73,000). However, we were not aware of the resolution of these three bak cameras. Until now.
A Winfuture.de report has stated that P20 Pro will have a jaw-dropping 4o MP primary sensor and an 8 MP secondary sensor. The third camera is a standalone sensor with a 20 MP resolution and could possibly have Monochrome functionality. All the sensors will be co-developed by German camera maker Leica, who had worked previously with Huawei on the Mate 10 series.
Now the report states that Huawei has implemented a 5X optical lossless zoom on the dual-camera setup. Yes, you read that right. Till now almost all the smartphones had been privy to 2X lossless zoom thanks to the introduction of a second telephoto lens. However, this 5X optical zoom, which Huawei is calling the Hybrid Zoom, is unheard of. Matter of fact the Nokia Lumia 1020 with its 41 MP sensor could come as close as 4X optical zoom. The apertures of the three lenses on the Huawei P20 Pro are said to be between f/1.6 and f/2.4.
This is the insane Huawei P20 Pro - the first Leica triple-cam smartphone - with a 40 MP main cam, 8 MP 5x hybrid zoom lens, 20 MP b/w sensor. (almost) all specs etc. here: https://t.co/Oa238dToNS ‚Äî Roland Quandt (@rquandt) March 19, 2018
Now there have been other reports that the third sensor might also have some kind of AI capabilities, however, this report does not mention anything about it. In the front of the device we see a 24MP selfie camera which will also be present on the Huawei P20.
A tweet by leakster Roland Quandt suggests that the Huawei P20 will come with a 5.8 inch display, 4 GB RAM and 128 GB internal storage and that it will be priced at ‚Ç¨679 (around Rs 54,000). The P20 Pro is expected to come with a 6.1 inch display, 6 GB RAM and 128 GB of internal storage priced at ‚Ç¨899 (around Rs 73,500) in Europe.
Another leak spotted on ithome.com suggests that the smartphones will be available in three more variants in other countries. This includes 4 GB RAM/ 256 storage, 6 GB RAM/64 GB storage and 6 GB RAM/256 GB storage variants.
Batley sent Pudsey St Lawrence crashing out of the Bradford League Twenty20 Cup in a dramatic quarter-final on Tuesday night.
The Mount Pleasant side defied their lowly league position to secure a tie with Saints and with the sides losing the same number of wickets, the clash was decided by the comparative score in the first five overs and that favoured Batley 32-2 to 25-1.
Batley overseas player Abubaker Khan produced a fine innings of 68 as he hit three sixes and eight fours to help his side to post 147-8.
Opener Charlie Best top scored with 36 for St Lawrence but no-one was able to take command as the innings was kept in check with Awais Munir claiming 4-28.
Oliver Ashford was run out off the final ball of his side's 20 overs which meant they finished on 147-8 ‚Äî the same score as Batley, who won after the comparative scores were checked.
Hanging Heaton progressed to the semi-finals with a 15-run victory over Pudsey Congs and will face Batley in a keen derby on June 20.
The match was played out amid dramatic scenes as plooms of smoke could be seen and loud explosions heard from a nearby factory fire.
David Stiff produced an explosive innings of his own as he smashed seven sixes, including four in four balls off one over to make 50 off just 18 balls.
Callum Geldart struck 26 against his former club, while Joe Fraser (25) and Gary Fellows (24) helped the home side post a challenging total of 176-8. Jacques Allen was pick of the Congs bowlers with 4-32.
Ashley Slater (44) and Irfan Amjad (41) led a spirited Congs reply which saw them make 161-9 with Geldart claiming 2-27.
Birstall progressed to the semi-finals of the competition for lower ranked clubs when they beat Oulton by 60 runs.
Ian Carradice struck seven fours and five sixes in an impressive innings of 68 from just 28 balls, while Rishi Limbechaya (53) and Charlie Orme (36) supported as Birstall posted 184-7.
Jonathan France led the Oulton reply with 50 not out but lacked the support as Kamran Khan claimed 2-17 from his fours overs and they were restricted to 124-8.
Birstall travel to Altofts or Great Preston in the semi-finals on June 20, while Hopton Mills face a trip to Sandal or Hunslet Nelson in the last four after they overcame Rodley by four runs in another exciting quarter-final tie on Tuesday.
Hopton posted 135-8 and held their nerve as they restricted Rodley to 131-8 from their 20 overs.
Both the Premier and Group B Twenty20 finals will be held at Pudsey St Lawrence on Sunday July 16.

In our weekly roundup of the best celebrity make-up and hair Instagrams, Kriti Sanon definitely takes the cake. While her hairstyle looks like a regular top knot from the front, look around and you'll notice a French braid moving upwards, into the bun‚Äîdefinitely a fun update. We also spotted Deepika Padukone in cherry red lips and a messy ponytail and Shilpa Shetty Kundra had her loose waves tied up in a pony with a pretty side part. Priyanka Chopra played around with mandarin lips this past weekend, while Sonakshi Sinha gave a nod to her classic winged eye, this time in a glossy finish as opposed to her regular matte.
Anushka Sharma took to textured hair with skinny braids and loaded up on mascara. We loved Aditi Rao Hydari's bitten red lip with just enough hue to make a statement. Lily Aldridge debuted beautiful bronzed skin, her look for the Victoria's Secret Holiday 2017 campaign shoot, while Bella Hadid reminded us that we're all the same, with a towel-head selfie. Plus, Jacqueline Fernandez continued with promotions for her upcoming movie, A Gentleman, in smooth, partly-pinned back hair and accentuated eyes. Can't think of what your look of the day should be? Take cues from Pooja Hegde's basic ponytail, pink lips and eyeliner; a no-brainer.

The Washington Post is reporting that President Trump told federal officials to deny Iowa's request to stabilize the individual health insurance market.
The Washington Post reports Trump became outraged after he read a Wall Street Journal account of what has become called the state's ‚Äústop gap‚Äù plan. It's an attempt to help up to 72,000 Iowans buy individual insurance policies for 2018 through the Affordable Care Act exchange. Trump reportedly directed the federal agency in charge of reviewing the state's request to tell Iowa no.
Iowa officials say there's been no denial delivered. The only notice they've gotten is that Iowa's waiver request has been ‚Äúdeemed‚Ä¶.complete.‚Äù That triggered a required public comment period that ends October 19.

Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Most Rev. Hassan Kukah, has enjoined politicians to provide quality governance, saying that Nigerians ought to be grateful to the military for their increasing patience for democracy.
The founder of the Kukah Centre, who made this comment in the light of the worsening quality of governance in Nigeria, noted that if now were the era when military coups were in vogue, the high level of frustrations experienced since the over 17 years of democracy in the country would have attracted more than one military coup.
He commended the military for their patience in allowing democracy to evolve, but he cautioned politicians to clean up their act in order to ensure that the soldiers remain in the barracks.
Briefing journalists at the Kukah Centre in Abuja yesterday, the clergyman stated: ‚ÄúDemocracy requires lots and lots of patience and hardwork. And I think we are mightily grateful to ourselves as a
people that despite the frustrations, despite the temptations, unlike before we have witnessed 16 to 17 years of patience on the side of the military because if it were 20 to 30 years ago, we would have had at least three or four coups already.
‚Äò'I think it is a measure of the faith of the military itself on the urgency of democratisation that has kept them in the barracks. But I think the politicians and the political class cannot take this patience for granted.‚Äù
Calling on the political leaders to be more sensitive to the plight of the people, Kukah noted that ‚Äúwhat we have experienced in the last few years has made us a laughing stock of other nations.
‚ÄúIn fact, people cannot understand why with so many resources we still cannot feed ourselves and we cannot do the basic things.‚Äù
Kukah condemned the religious sentiment being introduced to cover up for misgovernance, calling it ‚Äúa tragedy of tremendous proportion.‚Äù
‚ÄúAdding a religious dimension to the issue by politicians is dubious and criminal. In fact, we do need people with the requisite tools to be in power irrespective of their religion or faith,‚Äù Kukah declared.
Challenging Nigerians to be ready to interrogate all promises made by leaders, the bishop said that Nigerians shared in the blame for bad governance they are getting because they are not courageous enough to engage leaders on key issues.
‚ÄúThose in power have been holding us hostages, so we need to wake up and take the necessary steps. Our people are too naive to have taken all promises seriously. For example, we were told that corruption would be fought but we never asked questions on how. ‚ÄúNigerians have lost the sense of integrity and courage. We should take seriously the issue of courage in our convictions.‚Äù
On the call for a new coalition, Kukah said that democracy thrives through constant engagements, adding that the solution to a bad marriage is not necessarily in new marriage.
He pointed out that the issues that surrounded the last elections are still very much around and lamented that ‚Äúwe are far more divided now than we were before the 2015 elections.‚Äù
Kukah urged the government to be more tolerant of opposing views, noting those who express differing opinions should not be taken as enemies of government.
He announced that the centre had initiated a leadership forum to enlighten people about the virtues and sustenance of democracy.
According to him, Ghanaian President Nana Akufo Addo would be in Nigerian later this month to deliver a lecture on sustaining democracy in Africa.
Ok, let's get it out of the way: Whitecaps star Yordy Reyna was stapled to the bench for Peru in their 0-0 draw with Argentina in Buenos Aires on Thursday night.
Peru play at home against Colombia on Tuesday. A win for Peru would clinch at least a playoff spot against New Zealand.
The final standings odds are nuts, but if it shakes out that way, a Reyna vs. Marinovic qualifying series would be a fun thing to write about.
De regreso a lima ‚úàÔ∏èüí™üèæ A post shared by Yordy Reyna (@yordyreyna26) on Oct 6, 2017 at 11:48am PDT
In related news, Reyna took to social media this week to share the news his dog was missing and that he was desperate for the pup's return. He even offered tickets to whoever might track down his white furball.
Crisis averted, his dog has been found. And the tickets? The woman who found the missing pooch said she didn't want anything in return.
Now, to the big news: Argentina is in big trouble because of the draw.
More here from the Associated Press:
It's getting late for Lionel Messi, who'll be 31 during next year's World Cup in Russia.
He's yet to deliver a major trophy for Argentina, his country of birth. And it may not happen next year. In fact, Messi and Argentina may not even get there.
Argentina is on the verge of missing the World Cup for the first time since 1970 after stumbling to a 0-0 draw against Peru before a capacity crowd on Thursday at Boca Juniors' Bombonera stadium in Buenos Aires ‚Äî one of the dominant home-field advantages in all of world soccer.

Only one day of qualifying games remains in South America, and Argentina is off the pace for direct qualification.
‚ÄúOur situation is not very comfortable,‚Äù Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli said, ‚Äúbut it depends on us.‚Äù
Argentina, the runner-up to Germany three years ago in Brazil, plays on Tuesday against Ecuador in the thin air of Quito in the Andes. The Argentines are in sixth place, with the top four teams advancing automatically to Russia 2018. The fifth-place team can advance by winning an intercontinental playoff against Oceania champion New Zealand.
Brazil, which has already qualified, drew 0-0 against Bolivia on Thursday. Brazil has 38 points, followed by: Uruguay (28), Chile (26), Colombia (26), Peru (25), Argentina (25) and Paraguay (24).
Uruguay is expected to get through the final round on Tuesday. After that, it's too close to call, with four teams chasing the two automatic spots.
That will leave two teams trying to reach the playoff, which looms as Argentina's most probable route. The Argentine squad must win at 2,850 metres (9,350 feet) in Quito and get some help.
In other results Thursday: Paraguay beat Colombia 2-1, Chile beat Ecuador 2-1 and Uruguay was held to a 0-0 draw at Venezuela.
The last matches next Tuesday feature: Uruguay vs. Bolivia, Peru vs. Colombia, Ecuador vs. Argentina, Brazil vs. Chile and Paraguay vs. Venezuela. Ecuador, Venezuela and Bolivia are already out of contention.
‚Äî‚Äî
NO ARGENTINA?
It's almost unthinkable. No Messi. No Argentina in Russia. But it could happen.
Several generations of Argentines have no idea what it's like to be out of the World Cup. And that includes Messi, who will turn 31 when the Cup in being played next year in Russia.
Argentina had all the possession. Messi had a handful of good chances and hit the post in the first minute of the second half. In a fair world, Argentina would have won by several goals. Dario Benedetto had several chances, too.
In three qualifying matches under new coach Sampaoli, Argentina has scored just one goal.
Sampaoli tried to sound upbeat.
‚ÄúI remain confident we'll be in the World Cup,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt would really be unfair if a group that put it all out there ‚Äî like they did ‚Äî does not advance.
‚ÄúThroughout the game we had a marked advantage again them, but we could not break through.‚Äù
Peru's Argentina-born coach Ricardo Garcea was happier.
‚ÄúGetting a result in Argentina is really difficult,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut qualifying now depends only on us, which is important.‚Äù
The Senate passed by a vote of 97-2 a measure to toughen sanctions on Russia, a rare bipartisan move intended to respond to various aggressions by Russia against the U.S.
The measure, attached as an amendment to a broader bill dealing with Iran, firms up existing sanctions against Russia and imposes new ones.
Among those targeted are a wide array of what senators called "corrupt Russian actors," including those engaged in hacking, seizure of state resources, human rights abuses and supplying arms to the Syrian regime.
The measure also requires Congress to review any effort by the Trump administration to loosen sanctions on Russia.
The White House has not said whether Trump would sign the bill, raising the possibility of a veto standoff.
Attempts to sanction Russia for interfering in the election had stalled in Congress but gained momentum last week as the Senate began considering a separate bill to impose broader sanctions on Iran.
Democrats insisted that the Congress should also respond to Russia's aggressions, including its annexation of Ukraine, attacks in Syria and interference in the U.S. election.
A new bombshell report exposes the fact that the NFL players association donated to a multiple radical leftist Soros group.
From Breitbart
If you ever wondered why the NFL Players Association has never cracked down on their players, for disrespecting the flag and advocating leftist politics. It turns out that's because the NFLPA is every bit as radical as their players.
In tax documents recently released by 2ndVote, a conservative watchdog group, we learn that the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) made a donation of $5,000 in 2015 to the Center for Community Change Action, a George Soros funded and adamantly anti-Trump organization.
Yet, that just scratches the surface of the NFLPA's dealings and donations to the extreme left.
In 2013 and 2015, the NFLPA also contributed to the AFL-CIO's community affiliate, Working America. This group, according to Open Secrets, contributed $1 million to defeat President Trump during the 2016 election. However, the group's anti-Trump activities were not limited to the election. According to the Washington Times, ‚ÄúWorking America has since mobilized against the Republican tax-cut framework, denouncing it as the ‚ÄúTrump tax scam.‚Äù
Also according to the Times:
The NFLPA contributed $5,000 in 2014 to Jobs with Justice, another pro-union group backed by Mr. Soros, and $5,000 in 2013 to the progressive Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy.
The NFLPA donations from 2013, 2014 and 2015 were made before Mr. Trump was elected.
Other NFLPA charitable contributions went to a mix of groups supporting veterans, medical research and youth, including the Wounded Warrior Project, the Packard Center for ALS Research at Johns Hopkins, Active Minds, and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Washington.

TSB's Spanish owner Sabadell has proudly boasted about the success of its IT integration - amid widespread chaos for customers in Britain still grappling with the fallout out of a botched systems upgrade.
Last weekend TSB was supposed to complete the move of its customers' data from Lloyds' IT systems. The bank split from Lloyds Banking Group in 2013 and was sold to Sabadell in 2015 for ¬£1.7bn.
But the shift has caused on-going internet and mobile banking outages, as well failures of in-branch services, not to mention customers inadvertently accessing the accounts of other TSB users.
Now chair of the Treasury Select Committee, Nicky Morgan, is demanding urgent answers from the bank. "Potentially millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption. It simply isn't good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money," she said.
At least Sabadell seems pleased with its efforts, claiming last night that the digital platform Proteo4UK ‚Äì based on Sabadell's Proteo platform ‚Äì would integrate more than 5.4 million customers and provide greater operational simplicity.
Chairman of the bank Josep Oliu, said: "With this operation, Sabadell demonstrates its capacity of technological management not only in national but also international integrations. The new Proteo4UK platform is an excellent starting point for organic business growth and improved TSB efficiency."
The Register has asked TSB whether the Proteo4UK migration is related to the on-going outage problems, and in what way the migration ‚Äúdemonstrates its capacity of technological management not only in national but also international integration.‚Äù
Paul Pester, TSB's CEO said in update today:
I've just resurfaced after 48 hours with my teams who have been working as hard and fast as they can to get our services back up and running. This isn't the level of service that we pride ourselves on providing, and isn't what our customers have come to expect from TSB, and for that I'm truly sorry. "We're still seeing issues with access to our digital services. One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours. We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon. We'll let [our] customers know as soon as it's available again.
TSB said 402 customers had access to some data they would not normally be shown on Sunday during a "20-minute window". ¬Æ

A princess, a former French spy, and a Finnish Woman are on board Nostromo, a US registered luxury yacht in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The yacht is getting close to Goa, India. The princess contacts an NGO in London and asks for help. She says she is S heikha Latifa Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum of Dubai the middle daughter of the ruler of Dubai, ‚ÄúI am the one skydiving, not to be mixed with the other two daughters, both also called Latifa!‚Äù
This story could be the stuff of the weirdest Hollywood thrillers, but it seems to be true and unfolding right now.
In a Video sent to Radha Stirling, the CEO of Detained in Dubai, she says she could not cope with all the restrictions imposed on her by her family and is escaping the ‚ÄúGolden cage‚Äù she lived in. Her aim is to get to India, take a flight to the United States and seek asylum. Helping her in her escape are a former French intelligent officer, Herv√© Jaubert, and a friend, who later is confirmed to be a Finnish woman.
Since the first contact, the trio maintains frequent communication with Radha, until on Sunday the 4th of March 2018, when the story takes an even more thrilling turn. Herv√© informs Detained in Dubai, that they were within 50 miles of Indian shore as of 11:00 GMT, with the plan to disembark and fly to the US from Mumbai. Seven hours later, a distress call is made from Sheikha Latifa to Radha Stirling. Latifa tells Radha that she was hiding with her friend, that men were outside, that she didn't know what was happening and that she was ‚Äúhearing gunshots‚Äù. Then contact with the trio ceases immediately and permanently. This was two weeks ago and there is no trace of the three and the yacht since.
Detained in Dubai knew that in addition to Herv√©, there was a third person; a friend on board the yacht, but her identity was unknown until today. It turned out the person in question is a 41-year-old Finnish woman called Tiina Johanna Jauhiainen who has now been reported missing by her family. All three have been officially reported as missing in France, the UK, the USA, India, Finland and the UAE.
According to the Jauhianen family, who has released a statement through Detained in Dubai, Tiina was a close friend of Sheikha Latifa Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum of Dubai, known for her skydiving, a sport that Tiina was also passionate about and they had bonded over the years, becoming close confidants.
Sheikha Latifa had confided in Tiina that she had been imprisoned and abused as a result of a prior escape attempt and, since her release, was working on a plan to flee the country. Tiina had in turn, told her family of the situation and Latifa's ideas to leave the country. The two friends found public figure and French ex-secret service agent Herv√© Jaubert, who is famous for his book ‚ÄúEscape from Dubai‚Äù.
Tiina's family was contacted by Tiina from the yacht and they maintained communication with her. The last time Tiina was seen online was a few minutes before the distress call was made from Latifa to Radha.
‚ÄúWe have a US flagged yacht that has disappeared, a US/French national, a Finnish national and the daughter of the ruler of Dubai missing after reporting gunfire. We now have the daughter of the ruler of a country making serious allegations of criminal actions against her father.‚Äù States Radha Stirling of Detained in Dubai. ‚ÄúThe UAE has such strong commercial, trade, media and diplomatic ties, that this incident is likely to have a snowballing effect on the political and economic stability.‚Äù
So far, Authorities in the UAE, Finland, and France have been silent.
Social media users are using hashtags #FindLatifa #FindHerv√© #WhereisLatifa? #WhereisHerv√©? #EscapefromDubai#WhereisNostromo? to source information and raise awareness. #WhereisTiina?
‚ÄúTiina left our small town for the world, first to London in 1997, later settling in Dubai. She had always wanted to see the world, and she cares very little for material wealth or possessions.‚Äù Says Tiina's brother Oku Jauhiainen in the family's statement released today. ‚ÄúSince 2001, Tiina has lived in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, working mainly in real estate and fitness industries. In mid-2000s Tiina became an avid enthusiast of capoeira, a Brazilian martial art. In 2010 the sport also connected Tiina with Sheikha Latifa Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum of Dubai when Tiina became her instructor and personal trainer. They became close friends, with a particular passion for skydiving. Sheikha Latifa referred to Tiina as ‚Äúmy angel‚Äù and ‚Äúthe only person I can talk to about anything‚Äù.
Jauhiainen's family's last contact with Tiina was on Saturday 3rd of March. They were contacted by a friend the next day and heard about the possible raid on the yacht. The family contacted the Finnish Police and Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland and filed a missing persons report.
‚ÄúWe appeal to Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum as a father and to the Crown prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum as a brother, like us, to investigate this matter urgently, to contact Detained in Dubai and to make a public statement,‚Äù says Oku.
Since the incident, parties who had known the missing persons have confirmed their identity and last known location. Close friends have confirmed that the woman in the video is indeed Sheikha Latifa who explained that there are three Sheikha Latifa's and that she was the middle one known for skydiving, with the Instagram account latifa_1.
It has been reported to Escape from Dubai that UAE authorities have ‚Äúrounded up at least ten people who were known to be in communication with Tiina after the duo went missing in late February‚Äù. Detained in Dubai is seeking further information on those who may currently be in CID custody.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland have confirmed to Detained in Dubai, that they are seeking any information that may assist their investigation and that the Finnish Embassy in Abu Dhabi is following the case.
Detained in Dubai is a UK based NGO specializing in helping foreigners who are detained in Dubai. Escape from Dubai was founded in response to this incident to act as a central information point.

After a tip came in from a Good Samaritan, the Page Police Department has made an arrest in the case involving break-ins along church row.
On Saturday, February 4th the Page Police Department investigated a burglary at the Lutheran Church in Page in which a Baldwin piano, an amplifier and a Sony flat screen television were stolen. The night prior, a break-in also occurred at the Methodist Church.
Last Tuesday, the Police Department received anonymous information that a subject was seen pushing a piano on Lake Powell Boulevard near where the crime occurred. The piano was loaded into a truck and taken to a residence on the 100 block of Calle Hermosa.
After receiving the tip, Lieutenant Tim Lange and Sergeant Sam Meyers went to the residence on Calle Hermosa. During the visit, information was obtained that the piano, amplifier, television, and other illegal items were located inside the residence.
A search warrant was then obtained and the piano, amplifier, and flat screen television stolen from the church were recovered.
24-year-old Charmaine Black of Page was arrested and booked for felony possession of stolen property, felony possession of marijuana, felony possession of drug paraphernalia and other charges.
The investigation is on-going.
No player exemplified the Dodgers' late-season swoon more than reliever Pedro Baez, who seemed to ignite opponent rallies ‚Äî and incite the ire of the home fans ‚Äî whenever he was summoned from the bullpen.
Yet, when the club announced its 25-player roster for the National League division series Friday morning, the right-hander was on it. And manager Dave Roberts said it was an easy choice.
‚ÄúUltimately, Pedro has been a big part of what we've done all year,‚Äù Roberts said during a news conference before the game. ‚ÄúI trust him. Arguably, he's been our high-leveraged reliever outside of Kenley [Jansen] all year. So, I just think it makes sense.‚Äù
Roberts said he would ‚Äúprobably‚Äù deploy Brandon Morrow as the primary setup man for Jansen during the playoffs, with Tony Cingrani and Tony Watson as ‚Äú1 and 1A‚Äù from the left side.
Baez, 29, has season statistics that would have made his selection a no-brainer. He had a 2.95 earned-run average in 66 games and limited opponents to a .099 batting average with runners in scoring position ‚Äî second-best among all major league relievers.
But in the first three weeks of September, as the Dodgers were sliding toward 16 losses in 17 games, Baez had an ERA of 20.77. After a particularly tough outing at Philadelphia in which he faced seven batters and gave up four runs, he received tutelage from Jansen.
Jansen, the club's All-Star closer, advised Baez to change up his patterns and not rely solely on his fastball. The guidance seemed to help. Baez was able to string together four scoreless outings to finish the season, striking out seven of the last 12 hitters he faced.
Baez's roster candidacy was also bolstered by his competition for a spot. Fellow right-handed relievers Walker Buehler and Brock Stewart also struggled in September. Left-hander Luis Avilan is coming off an injury.
One factor that probably wasn't in Baez's favor: his past postseason experience. Entering Friday's game, he had made 11 playoff appearances and given up seven earned runs in 9 2/3 innings.
Buehler and Stewart traveled to the club's Arizona training complex at Camelback Ranch, where they will throw and be on call if the club needs them later.
For seconds
Logan Forsythe got the start at second base over Chase Utley in Game 1 of the NLDS, even though Arizona started a right-hander, Taijuan Walker.
‚ÄúI don't think that we could have made a wrong decision,‚Äù Roberts said before the game. ‚ÄúI think that part of it is I think there is a tick grade better from defense from Logan. You've got your ace on the mound and the ability to have Chase on the bench to use him at any point in time ‚Ä¶ I think holds huge value.‚Äù
Another consideration, Roberts said, was that Friday marked Forsythe's first career playoff appearance. ‚ÄúI think it's a benefit for him to start a game, to get into the game, the flow of the postseason, as opposed to ‚Ä¶ taking his first pinch-hit or postseason at-bat off the bench.‚Äù
Silence of the Lamb
Jake Lamb had four hits in Arizona's wild-card game win over Colorado on Wednesday. He hit 30 home runs and drove in 105 runs.
And he was not in the Diamondbacks' starting lineup Friday.
On Thursday, shortly after Arizona arrived at Dodger Stadium for a workout, Lamb said there were ‚Äúa couple‚Äù of pitchers he could face during the postseason that he would tell manager Torey Lovullo he was uncomfortable facing.
Clayton Kershaw might have been one of them. Lamb, a left-handed hitter, has never faced Kershaw and his career batting average is just .159 against all left-handers. Adam Rosales, who batted .225 this season ‚Äî .240 against left-handers ‚Äî started at third base.
‚ÄúI just felt like we've been doing something like that through the course of the year since we got Rosie, and I felt like I wanted to just stay with the script,‚Äù Lovullo said before the game.
An upgrade? Very debatable. Rosales came into the game with one hit in six at-bats against Kershaw, with three strikeouts.
The Dodgers will start another left-hander, Rich Hill, in Game 2, but Lamb might get a start Saturday. He is two for four against Hill, with a home run and three RBIs.
In other lineup decisions, Lovullo went with Jeff Mathis at catcher over Chris Iannetta. Mathis is superior defensively but batted .215 this season. Iannetta batted .254 with 17 home runs. At second base, the Diamondbacks started Brandon Drury over Daniel Descalso. Drury came into the game one for 11 life-time against Kershaw. The hit: a home run.
Germany's Penta is the latest European startup to throw its banking wares into the ring. The burgeoning company is launching a new digital bank account targeting SMEs. Running on top of Banking-as-a-Platform solarisBank, the new offering perhaps resembles something like Tide in the U.K., and is designed to meet all of the banking needs of small to medium-sized businesses, including, of course, startups.
Opening in Beta today, the premise for Penta is that SMEs and startups are currently underserved by banks and that ‚Äúbusiness banking can be really awful,‚Äù co-founder and CEO Lav Odorovic tells me. This typically sees traditional banks make account opening cumbersome and much more difficult than it should be, whilst simultaneously charging exorbitant fees for making payments or international money exchange.
There's also a long list of other unmet needs, such as tracking employee spending and automating accounting and invoicing. ‚ÄúWe ultimately concluded that business owners want a fully digital bank that's easy to use and that has the apps and products they need to help them scale quicker, save more time and money,‚Äù he says.
Through its partnership with solarisBank, Odorovic says Penta is able to offer a full-fledged business bank account, and not a freelance or retail bank account labeled as business, like some other challenger banks do. And, in a nod to marketplace banking, beyond a business bank account, the startup isn't planning on developing additional financial products of its own to upsell, but instead wants to integrate the best third-party fintechs and other service providers.
‚ÄúWe strongly believe that we can create the most value for our customers by partnering with the best fintech and business app providers and offering their products directly to our customers in our Business App Store,‚Äù says the Penta CEO. ‚ÄúPartners can include someone like TransferWise or Revolut for FX, or Debitoor/SMACC for accounting‚Äù.
To that end, Odorovic say Penta's typical customer is a high-tech startup founder who uses Slack or Trello with their team on a daily basis. ‚ÄúTheir startup is a team of two or as big as 50 and is building tech that is hopefully solving a problem and making people's lives easier!.‚Äù he says.
This is also reflected in Penta's pricing model: the digital-only bank is offering a completely free account for ‚Äúbootstrapped‚Äù or very early-stage businesses that doesn't charge a monthly account fee and provides 10 free transactions per month. Thereafter, each additional transaction costs ‚Ç¨0.10 cents per transaction.
‚ÄúOnce you start growing, your business banking needs to become more complex. You may need to start doing your accounting, send or receive money from abroad, manage your cash-flow better, or do payroll. So we'll offer you these products via our Penta Business App Store. We call this: Pay as you Grow,‚Äù says Odorovic.
For now, Penta is only available to businesses registered in Germany. The startup bank plans to go Europe-wide next year.
"I knew what I was signing up for," said Cozart, who was back starting at third base Tuesday. "I've said from the get-go that whatever the teams needs at the time I'm going to do it."
Some may be surprised to learn that the ballot at the voting booth on June 7 for the Ontario election will feature as many as eight names for the Guelph riding.
The winner that will represent the Royal City at Queen's Park will likely be one of Sly Castaldi of the Liberals, New Democrat Aggie Mlynarz, Progressive Conservative Ray Ferraro or Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner.

But there are four others that have been on the campaign trail, trying to get their message out the residents.
Michael Riehl is the Libertarian candidate for Guelph and said his party is quite different from the others.
‚ÄúThe four main parties always have the same response and solution to every problem. They want to increase this program or add this amount of dollars to this program or add this policy,‚Äù he said in a phone interview.
‚ÄúThe Libertarian Party wants to reduce the amount of government, return to small government, return to local community-based organizations and let individuals determine how they go about their daily lives.‚Äù
Riehl said the party has candidates in 117 ridings in Ontario ‚Äî the most in the party's history.

Juanita Burnett, of the Communist Party, ran in the 2014 Ontario election and is the only candidate that has returned for this campaign.
She said her party is focused on providing assistance to the less wealthy.
‚ÄúFor Guelph, we need more low-cost housing, rental housing that people can afford,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúWe need at the very least a $15 an hour minimum wage. Our party is asking for $20 an hour because $15 is a bare minimum.‚Äù
Burnett is also a proponent of a 32-hour work week, doubling the corporate tax rate and looking at expanded, free 24-hour child care.
Thomas Mooney has had a bit of a rocky campaign going to the newly-formed Ontario Party from the Ontario Alliance after that party dissolved a number of riding associations in the province.
Mooney touted his ‚ÄúGuelph first‚Äù agenda and said his party allows him to put the interests of his constituents on the forefront.
‚ÄúThe whole idea of the Ontario Party is we're putting Ontario first. We keep hearing that with many of the parties across the province, but the problem is that as soon as we elect those people then we lose our local say,‚Äù Mooney said.
‚ÄúOne of the key things with the Ontario Party is, I, as your local representative, will remain able to freely speak for the people of Guelph.‚Äù
READ MORE: Here's what Ontario's parties are promising voters for dental care
Finally, Paul Taylor represents the ‚ÄúNone of the Above Party‚Äù which has a unique philosophy.
Candidates are accountable to their constituents and there are no central party policies or controls on elected MPPs, according to Taylor.
‚ÄúThe beautiful thing with this party is, it actually throws it back to me and says, ‚ÄòYou do whatever is best for Guelph,'‚Äù Taylor explained.
One local issue Taylor feels strongly about is the need for more funding for Guelph General Hospital.
‚ÄúThey're running at a level right now at that hospital of what I would call ‚Äòan emergency status,' so if, Lord forbid, a real disaster did happen, they wouldn't be able to manage,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúSomething that I would fight for on day one is to make sure that hospital gets the proper funding it needs to provide Guelph with the proper health care.‚Äù
So-called fringe parties rarely win seats in the Ontario Legislature, but would have the ability to affect an electoral result, and with Guelph in a tight race, they could make quite an impact.
New Delhi: Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday said both pollution and traffic congestion in the National Capital Region (NCR) will be reduced by half in the next two months.
"We are working on projects worth Rs 40,000 crore and this will help the people living in NCR," Gadkari said at India TV Budget Conclave in New Delhi.
He said that vehicles can run on ethanol extracted from paddy husks that are burnt rampantly in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.
"One tonne of paddy husk can yield 280 litres of ethanol. We will be setting up ethanol industry, which will give jobs to 40 to 50 lakh youths, and prevent air pollution too. This will also lower petro products import," he said.
Gadkari, who also heads Shipping and Water Resources Ministries, also claimed that they would clean up the Ganga by 80 percent by March 2019.
On the Budget, he said that it is the first one which can be "rightfully described as an agricultural budget".
"I hail from a place (Vidarbha) where more than 10,000 farmers have committed suicide. When I became a minister, I felt that our voice was not being heard in Delhi.
"But now I can say, for the first time since Independence, this is the first budget presented by Arun Jaitley under the leadership of Narendra Modiji, which can be rightfully described as an agricultural budget," he said.
Taking a dig on Congress President Rahul Gandhi over his tweet that the Modi government had promised better income for farmers four years ago, Gadkari said that some people keep their reactions ready in writing even before the budget is presented.
"Those unemployed and frustrated because of us, can you expect praises from them?"
He said that for the first time Operation Greens will be launched to protect prices of onion, potato and tomatoes for which Rs 500 crore have been allocated and this will "help in controlling demand and supply".
The chairperson of National Commission for Women, Rekha Sharma, said on Friday that the violence at BHU campus was a conspiracy by outsiders.Speaking to the media in Varanasi, Sharma said that the girls were protesting peacefully but some outsiders and anti-social elements hijacked the protest, and this eventually led to the violence.‚ÄúThe lathi-charge on girls is condemnable, but the situation went out of hand when outsiders hijacked the protest and started provoking students. Police had to resort to lathi-charge,‚Äù she said.On being asked about her meeting with vice-chancellor Girish Chandra Tripathi, she said, ‚ÄúHe did not meet me and neither did he answer my call. He will be summoned to Delhi as he did not play his role in controlling the situation.‚ÄùTripathi is under fire for his alleged mishandling of the student protests. He has gone on leave amid indications from top HRD Ministry sources that the central government was upset with the manner in which he handled the entire episode. Tripathi even blamed the girls for dishonouring the university by protesting against harassment.Sharma further said that a few men are living in the hostel illegally and she has asked the female students to identify and list them. The list will be given to the SSP and action will be taken against the culprits, she said.‚ÄúOur team found that there are many cases of harassment on campus,‚Äù she said, claiming that it was mostly BHU students involved in such cases.The security at the campus has been increased, Sharma said. ‚ÄúWe have instructed the university administration to increase security outside the Naveen Hostel. CCTV cameras have also been installed in the campus. The SSP has also been asked to deploy extra police force,‚Äù she added.Last month, a number of students, including women and two journalists, were injured in a lathi-charge by the police after students launched a protest against an alleged harassment and university inaction.

CHINIOT - Two suspects were held for allegedly abducting a married woman and shaving her head accusing her of being a police informer, at Sardaray Wala here on Wednesday.
According to the police, the accused identified as Akram Bhatti, Azmatullah and Ehsanullah kidnapped the married woman namely Razia Bibi, wife of Sabir Ali, when she was going through a village street. They brought her to their den where they shaved her head with a razor.
The reason behind the incident was that Akram Bhatti and accomplices were hardened criminals and were declared proclaimed offenders by police. They were arrested by police about two years back. They suspected their arrest a result of information given to police by Razia Bibi and her husband.
After their release on bail, they decided to teach a lesson to the couple. So, they abducted Razia and shaved her head.
On being informed of the incident, Muhammad Wala police reached the spot and arrested two of them including Akram Bhatti and Azmatullah. Ehsanullah succeeded in fleeing away.
Police spokesperson Waqas told the media that police were taking necessary steps for arrest of the third accused. A special team has been formed for the purpose, he added.

New Delhi: Former IPL commissioner Lalit Modi hit out at the BCCI after the apex body revoked Rajasthan Cricket Association's suspension on the condition that he stays away from its functioning.
The RCA was suspended in 2014 when Modi stood and triumphed in the state body's elections. The domestic and age-group competitions were taken care of by the BCCI, which lifted the suspension at its Special General Meeting (SGM).
"Wow ??. Amazing. Not been in india for 7 Years. But the #Crook's in @BCCI @IPL are even afraid of my name. Clowns just living off what I created for india.Good luck to these jokers who never did a days work in their life except live off what others created," Modi wrote on his twitter handle.
The BCCI had suspended Modi on April 24, 2010 ‚Äì a day after that year's IPL final, holding him guilty on 22 charges.
Earlier in the day, Modi said he was happy for Rajasthan cricket after the ban was lifted.
"RCA ban revoked. Happy for #Rajasthan cricket & more importantly for our cricketers. It's been a challenging journey of patience & grit and the right thing has been done. Pray for to ascend of #RajasthanCricket."
Modi's son, Ruchir Modi, too, welcomed the development.
Sixthman/Crush MusicJust a few weeks after the release of their new album a girl, a bottle and a boat, the members of Train are boarding an actual boat today, for their fourth annual Sail Across the Sun fan cruise.
The cruise, which goes from Tampa to Cozumel, Mexico on the Norwegian Jade, features Train, of course, but also about 20 other musical acts, plus comedian Jim Breuer. This year's lineup includes Natasha Bedingfield, Matt Nathanson, Michael Franti, the '90s hip-hop group Arrested Development, Eric Hutchinson, LOLO, Yacht Rock Revue and tons more.
In addition to the music, there are theme nights where fans are encouraged to dress in costume, plus a variety of games and activities ‚Äî hosted by bandmembers ‚Äî for fans of all ages. Last year, during one activity for children, Train singer Pat Monahan fondly remembers letting kids smash cupcakes into his face.
Wine tastings are also a big draw on the cruise, because Train has its own line of wine. In fact, their winemaker is going on the cruise with them.
Four years into the event, Monahan tells ABC Radio, ‚ÄúI think we're trying to discover new, exciting things. This year, we're gonna have wine slushies, which is very adventurous and dangerous.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe cruise has become kind of a lifestyle for certain people,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúI love that people come from Australia during their summer, and a lot of people from the U.K. and a lot of New Jerseys and New York [fans]‚Ä¶I love that.‚Äù
What's important for Monahan, though, is that the fans and the bands all have a great time hanging out together.
‚ÄúI know that Kid Rock goes on his cruise and sits in the hot tub and drinks Bud Lights with everybody,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd that's just the kinda vibe we wanna have.‚Äù

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau intends to introduce legislation by the end of year which will erase the convictions of those who were punished in Canada for sexual activity with a same-sex partner.
Trudeau made the announcement on Parliament Hill at a ceremony where the Pride, Transgender Pride and Canada 150 flags were raised.
‚ÄúOur government believes in equality and equal treatment for all Canadians,‚Äù Trudeau said. ‚ÄúThat is why we are moving forward on legislation that makes it possible to erase the convictions of Canadians who were unjustly convicted of a crime ‚Äì simply for who they were, or who they loved.‚Äù

Trudeau said his government also intends to apologize for the historical wrongs committed against gay, lesbian and transgendered Canadians.
The initiative is one of several the Liberal government has made in order to address LGBTQ rights.
Bill C-16 is currently under review in the Senate. The bill would add gender identity and gender expression to the national Human Rights Act and Criminal Code of Canada.
In March, Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould proposed legislation to repeal Section 159 of the Criminal Code which ‚Äúunfairly discriminated against the LGBTQ community.‚Äù
READ MORE: Parents of transgender youth urge Senate to back Bill C-16
MP Randy Boissonnault, Trudeau's special advisor on LGBTQ issues, said in April the federal government will issue an apology to gay and lesbian Canadians purged from the military and public service because of their sexuality.
‚ÄúIt's certainly something that's going to happen in this mandate,‚Äù Boissonnault told Global News in an interview. ‚ÄúI know the community is impatient.‚Äù
Researchers with the ‚ÄúWe Demand an Apology‚Äù network estimate thousands of LGBTQ Canadians were kicked out of the military and other national security agencies beginning in the 1950s because their homosexuality was seen as a weakness that could make them vulnerable to the ‚Äúenemy.‚Äù
Stocks opened solidly higher on Wall Street on Monday as the market comes off its worst week since March.
Gains in technology companies and banks helped send indexes higher. Apple, Microsoft and Facebook each rose about 1% in the first few minutes of trading.
Bank of America was up 1.6%, and JPMorgan Chase rose 1.1%.
Signs of anxiety in the market that flared last week were on the wane. Prices for bonds and gold fell.
The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 19 points, or 0.8%, to 2,460.
The Dow Jones industrials rose 128 points, or 0.6%, to 21,988. The Nasdaq composite rose 59 points, or 1%, to 6,315.
THE SMOKING GUN:
A woman is facing a felony animal abuse charge after she was recorded kicking and stomping her small dog inside an elevator at a Florida condominium.
Police allege that Keevonna C'Ante Wilson, 24, attacked the dog late last month in Aventura, a city 20 miles north of Miami.
The September 20 incident was recorded by a surveillance camera inside an elevator at the luxury Artech condominium, according to a police report. Investigators subsequently identified Wilson (seen at right) as the alleged abuser and arrested her last Tuesday.
Building security officials happened upon the footage of Wilson stomping on Chasitywhile reviewing surveillance tapes after receiving a report about a dog defecating in the elevator.
The puppy‚Äìa Shih Tzu-Yorkie mix named Chasity‚Äìwas removed from Wilson's custody by Miami-Dade Animal Services, which provided medical care to the canine. While no visible injuries were detected on the animal, cops noted that, ‚Äúthe dog winced a few times when being held.‚Äù
Charged with felony animal cruelty, Wilson was released from custody after posting $5000 bond, according to court records.
FREETOWN, (Reuters) - A mudslide killed more than 200 people on the outskirts of Sierra Leone's capital Freetown on Monday, sweeping away homes and leaving residents desperate for news of missing family members.
The Red Cross said at least 205 bodies had been taken to the central morgue in Freetown. Police and military personnel were at the scene in the mountain town of Regent searching for people trapped in the debris.
Many people living at the foot of Mount Sugar Loaf were asleep when the mountainside collapsed, burying dozens of houses, including two-storey buildings, witnesses said.
Standing in the rain, residents sobbed as they mourned family members and waited for news of those missing. Adama Kamara wept as she described a failed attempt to rescue her 7-week-old child.
"We were inside when we heard the mudslide approaching. I attempted to grab my baby but the mud was too fast. She was covered alive," said Kamara, who escaped with bruises. She said she was not sure what had happened to her husband.
A man said he had left early in the morning to buy bread. When he returned, his wife, children, siblings and in-laws were all dead.
The death toll is expected to rise as more bodies are recovered, Red Cross spokesman Abu Bakarr Tarawallie said.
Vice President Victor Foh told Reuters at the scene: "It is likely that hundreds are lying dead underneath the rubble." He said a number of illegal buildings had been erected in the area.
"The disaster is so serious that I myself feel broken," he said. "We're trying to cordon the area. Evacuate the people."
An excavator plowed away at the mountainside and ambulances rushed back and forth to the city center with bodies and wounded, but rescue efforts were hampered by bad roads and the weather, a Reuters witness said.
Community chief Fatmata Tarawallie said she had started calling for help at 4 a.m. (0400 GMT) but that it did not come soon enough.
"Now our community has sunk," she said.
Could a fire like the one that ripped through a London apartment tower Wednesday morning break out in Metro Vancouver?
It's a question some are asking after a night of horrifying images of the blaze, which left at least 12 dead and dozens more injured.
CKNW's Steele & Drex checked in with Capt. Jonathan Gormick of the Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services who says while our city may be packed with towers, residents can sleep easy knowing they're unlikely to meet the same fate.
LISTEN: Vancouver Fire Rescue's Captain Jonathan Gormick discusses the possibility of an apartment fire in Vancouver
‚ÄúIt seems like a multi-system failure to me,‚Äù said Gormick of the devastating Grenfell Tower fire.
Gormick said we'll have to await the results of the investigation, but the age of the building and recent renovations that may have damaged suppression systems are possible red flags.
But he said by those same measures, Vancouver residents have little to fear.
New city, new codes
‚ÄúThe initial images looked unreal. It literally looked like something out of Hollywood, and I think that's really because we just don't see those kinds of fires, with that much extension, in North America or specifically in the city of Vancouver.‚Äù
Gormick said Vancouver is lucky in that it's a relatively young city, one that has seen virtually all of its densification take place in the last three decades.
‚ÄúSo that means that all of the high-rises and multi-family dwellings are built to modern standards,‚Äù he said.
On top of the modern construction, Gormick said Vancouver has ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù fire codes that were instituted in the 1990s, over protests from developers.
‚ÄúWe have a large degree of compartmentalization, and we have very extensive and complex fire suppression systems,‚Äù Gormick said.
Those include systems designed to stop a fire from spreading, and others, such as pressurized stairwells, that protect exits for occupants fleeing from disaster.
Enforcement
But what about older buildings in disrepair, including Downtown Eastside SROs like the notorious Balmoral?
‚ÄúAll of the systems in the world don't do any good if they're in a state of disrepair,‚Äù said Gormick.
But he said Vancouver inspectors are themselves aggressive about the fire code ‚Äì conducting annual checks on all buildings to ensure safety systems have been tested, maintained, and tagged by a qualified person.
Gormick said if owners don't keep up, the city isn't afraid to penalize them.
‚ÄúIf we come back and find that's not done, at the very least we can start to impose fines and we can go as far as to prosecute owners.‚Äù
Vancouver has been home to several high-rise fires, but they've largely been contained to one or two units.
However the city is now home to the world's tallest wood-and-steel high-rise, the 18-storey Brock Commons at UBC.
It will soon be surpassed by an even taller 19-storey wood construction building in Coal Harbour.
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) ‚Äî Get your shovels ready: another round of lake-effect snow is coming to West Michigan.
A vigorous clipper system will pass through the Great Lakes Monday evening, dropping a few inches of snow and leading to hazardous travel, mainly along and south of Interstate 96.
If you have to go out, check in with 24 Hour News 8 for traffic updates beginning 4:30 a.m. Tuesday on Daybreak.
>>Inside woodtv.com: Interactive radar | Weather alerts | Traffic map
The clipper system coupled with lake-effect snow that will kick up late Monday night will lead to several inches of snow across the area, especially near Lake Michigan.
The cold air that flows in after the clipper's departure will lead to the biggest lake-effect snow event of the season so far.
The lake-effect snow Tuesday may drift as far inland as Kent County, although most of it will be focused on the lakeshore.
The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warnings for Allegan, Ottawa, Muskegon, Van Buren, Oceana, Mason, Berrien, St. Joseph and Cass counties.

Richardson International Limited has announced the acquisition of Bestland Air Ltd., an independent crop inputs retailer located near Starbuck, Manitoba.
‚ÄúThis business is an excellent addition to our Richardson Pioneer network as it will be an extension of our full-service Richardson Pioneer Ag Business Centre in Starbuck,‚Äù says Tom Hamilton, Vice-President, Agribusiness Operations. ‚ÄúIt will provide us with additional capacity and enhance our ability to continue providing local producers with leading seed, fertilizer and crop inputs technologies.‚Äù
The transaction closed on Friday.
Richardson recently acquired 10 retail crop inputs locations from CHS Canada in October and purchased two independent, full-service retail crop inputs centres in Vermilion and Forestburg, AB last summer.
The company is also expanding its network by building new crop inputs facilities across the Prairies. Two new crop inputs centres opened in Elrose, SK last summer and in Pasqua, SK in November. A third new crops inputs facility is currently under construction in Wakaw, SK and will be open for business in 2018.

It seems Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess isn't quite sure what to say about Tesla.
About a month ago, we shared that Diess (whose personal car is a VW eGolf) believes Volkswagen can stop Tesla. His reasoning behind the statement was simply VW has abilities that Tesla doesn't possess. Of course, this type of statement sends some into a frenzy, but honestly, Volkswagen's scale speaks for itself. Volkswagen Group sells more cars globally than any other automaker. The company's manufacturing capability in a mere two days matches Tesla's yearly output.
This is not to say that Volkswagen isn't aware of competitors, and when it comes to the EV market, a different picture can be painted. According to Reuters, Diess was questioned about who he sees as VW's primary competitors, he shared in an internal publication:
‚ÄúIn the old world it is Toyota, Hyundai, and the French carmakers. In the new world it is Tesla.‚Äù
The above statement comes as no surprise. However, Diess took his words a step further:
‚ÄúTesla belongs among the competitors which has abilities that we currently do not have.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis shows that we need to significantly improve. We can do this. We measure ourselves against Tesla quite deliberately. Our goal: Using our abilities not just to catch up, but even to overtake.‚Äù
Diess' recent share can be seen as a striking contradiction to his prior statement mentioned above. However, it can also be understood that both automakers have abilities that the other does not. VW, of course, with its enormity and experience, but Tesla with its cutting edge technology, substantial head start, and domination in the EV segment.
To put it all into perspective, Volkswagen sold 5,987,800 cars last year, and Tesla sold 83,922. Both companies face adversity and reputation issues, but for very different reasons. VW is still on the rebound from the infamous ‚ÄúDieselgate‚Äù scandal. Tesla is up against traditional dealerships trying to stop its direct sales methods, unions hoping to step in an organized its factory, and the simple fact that it's still viewed as a niche market startup without the ability to make money in a not-yet-popular segment.
Additionally, Tesla's engineers are primarily software experts, whereas VW is still entrenched in the old. VW aims to change that, however, and while it's going to be a while, the automaker claims to be well ahead of most others. It premiered its all-new I.D. family of electric vehicles at various auto shows over the last year, and just announced that its all-electric compact car could be as much as $8,000 cheaper than the Tesla Model 3.

: Mumbai BJP president Ashish Shelar on Monday adviced Raj Thackeray not to punch above his weight, a day after the MNS chief called for a "Narendra Modi-mukt Bharat" while addressing a party rally in Mumbai."The Maharashtra Assembly is already free of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) as it has only one MLA of that party, who has almost become a part of the BJP," Shelar told reporters outside the Legislative Assembly.Addressing the annual Gudhi Padwa (Maharashtrian new year) rally of the MNS in central Mumbai, Thackeray had appealed to all parties to unite to ensure that the country becomes "free" of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Taking a dig at Thackeray, whose party is battling for political survival in the state, Shelar said the corporators who had won the Mumbai civic polls last year on the MNS ticket had already left the party."I think he has taken too much liberty to make 'Modi-Mukta Bharat' appeal. He should speak what suits his stature," said Shelar.A few months back, six out of the seven corporators of the MNS had defected and joined its arch rival Shiv Sena in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).In an apparent reference to Thackeray visiting NCP chief Sharad Pawar at the latter's residence in Mumbai in south Mumbai a day ahead of the rally, Shelar said the MNS chief seems to be under the influence of the Maratha veteran now."Earlier, Raj Thackeray's speeches used to have some influence of Shiv Sena supremo late Balasaheb Thackeray, but of late it looks like they have the influence of Pawar. The way people are leaving Raj Thackeray, I don't think anybody in Maharashtra believes him," said the BJP leader.

LIEGE, Belgium/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgian authorities faced questions on Wednesday over why a prison inmate, suspected of links to radical Islamists in jail, was let out for a day, enabling him to carry out what police called a "terrorist attack" in the city of Liege.
The justice minister, who oversees the prison service, said he felt "responsible" for Tuesday's bloodshed in which two policewomen and a bystander were killed. The attacker was shot dead by police at a nearby school shortly afterward.
Interior Minister Jan Jambon said authorities were still examining the motives of Benjamin Herman, a 31-year-old Belgian drug dealer who had been in jail for years but was let out for two days on Monday to prepare for an eventual release in 2020.
Herman had shouted "Allahu Akbar", the Muslim affirmation of faith, during his attack and he had had contact with Islamist radicals in jail in 2016 and early 2017.
He also appeared to have followed online exhortations from Islamic State to stab police officers and use their service weapons to shoot others, prosecutors said.
A school cleaning woman who found herself "nose to face with the killer" told public broadcaster RTBF that he spared her because she was Muslim.
While he briefly held her hostage, he told her he wanted the police to "writhe; I want to make them stew."
Justice Minister Koen Geens told RTBF radio he was having pangs of conscience over whether the man should have been allowed furlough.
Still reeling from the attack, residents of Belgium's third biggest city lay flowers and candles at the scene of the shooting on Wednesday, and officials held a moment of silence.
"We had all of the little ones from the high school who were evacuated," said an emotional nursery school teacher, Joelle Chalon. "I walk this way to work every day."
Authorities praised the quick-wittedness of the cafe owner outside whose bar Herman had killed the two policewomen, aged 54 and 44. By the time the killer, wielding two police pistols, came in looking for more victims, the cafe proprietor had got all of his customers into hiding.
Jambon described Herman as a psychologically unstable man who might have been on drugs, pointing to his murder of an acquaintance 50 km (30 miles) away on Monday night.
"There are signs he was radicalised in prison but is it that radicalisation which drove him to commit these acts?" Jambon said, adding that although Herman was flagged up in security reports in 2016 and early 2017, he had been a fringe figure.
Unlike the aftermath of previous suspected "lone wolf" militant attacks in Europe, there has been no claim of responsibility by Islamic State.
JAIL TO JIHAD?
In and out of jail for a variety of crimes since 2003, Herman may have found a path to violence that has heightened concerns that Europe's prisons are incubators for jihadism.
It was the fourteenth time since his detention that he was granted temporary leave, Geens said. "Everyone in Belgium is asking the same question: how is it possible that someone convicted of such serious acts was allowed to leave prisons?" Deputy Prime Minister Alexander de Croo was quoted as saying.
The national crisis centre, on high alert since a Brussels-based Islamic State cell helped kill 130 people in Paris in 2015, did not raise its alert level, indicating no follow-up attacks were expected.
"I think it was just one individual who completely snapped," said Pieter Van Ostaeyen, a specialist on jihadism. "I don't think it was an organised attack."
Convicts have been behind several Islamist militant attacks in Europe. In Belgium, around 450 prisoners are deemed radical, including 46 that are seen as a threat of radicalising others, according to lawmaker George Dallemagne, who sits on several Belgian parliamentary security committees.
"We have a tragic experience in Belgium, with people entering prison as petty criminals and leaving as terrorists," he told Reuters.

RAPING and killing of tender aged girls by middle or old aged males is a collective embarrassment. There is something seriously wrong with the men.
The incidence of heinous crime of molestation and murder of minors is dangerously increasing. If we can't stop it, we must die somewhere in dry pond, shamelessly.
Raping becomes a norm now. An order which is being assumed to be entering the cultural territory. Yes, the rape culture it will soon be addressed with. When the word rape and the news about it strikes the minds regularly, it would slowly kill its sensitivity vis-a-vis rape.
So the mind would not mind about the rape as a crime. It would be a common phenomenon, not a specific or disturbing one. The equation of thoughts, emotions and beliefs would change. Raping then would be accepted as habit. Which finally would lead to be the part of attitude and then behavour.
Once anything becomes the identity of behavour or character, it is hard to retrieve it from the climax to the brain mechanism to reshape the thought process leading to the manifest results in behaviour.
Or, to put it simply, the paradigm shift would be much more difficult. Because, it would make the entry in subconscious part of mind. And, we shall live up with this mind set quite easily, unless something extraordinary triggers ripples in thinking process to re-arrange it. So, the alarm must wake up us all. Today, it decomposes the individual essence, tomorrow the society would fall prey to it.
Rape is an unpardonable crime. Because, this signals the hegemonic traits of men and the subjugation of women for their no sin that too so brutally. Why is man too free to release his carnal frustration anywhere, anyway or with anyone he chooses to? Why is he so wild to growl over the little angels like Ashifa here and Zainab there across the boarders for his lust and killing them through spine shivering means?
Earlier, these beasts molested Nirbhaya and killed her the way even devil can't resort to do so. This is a continuous brutality, seldom being noticed or reported. More surprisingly, it is quite away from the ambit of humanity when the men in uniform would turn into wrath over all females of twin villages who could surely fall in the age of their own daughters, sisters, mothers and grandmothers too. This too happened in the near past around us.
The question is not the oppression, religion or resistance, it is the matter of humanity, rights and gender exploitation. By no way, the justification is entertained. It only exposes the perpetuators to the depth of their nature they are wrapped with.
Targeting the soft gender is not bravery. It is an embarrassment for the spirit of humanity, instead. She is mother. She is daughter. She is sister and the better half too. She is significantly an honourable part of God's broader scheme of perpetuation of universe. She has a status which the men easily ignore.
Yes, the decent, reasonable and wise men never do that. They always extend fair views and care for women of all ages. Such noble men realise that they are not born out of stones. It is actually the woman by who's pains and agonies they are existing as being themselves.
Neither state nor society succeeds in curbing the incidence of rape. Who else is coming to check it, we are waiting for. Now all parents, who are bestowed with daughters, are apprehensive. The feelings of fear and anxiety grip them all. We claim to be living in enlightened age of mutual trust and respect.
But, shall our daughters and sisters dare to walk alone from bus stop to home in the time ahead in near future? Who is certain to reply in affirmative? Almost none.
Verma Committee, after the much hyped gruesome incidence of Nirbhaya, had recommended certain changes to be effected in the judiciary and police. Nothing was changed.
So remained the rate of incidence as it was. At times, these brutal crimes are politicised too in the midst of heart rendering cries for justice by the victim families. But it fails to strike the ear drums of those who are at the helm.
The recent instance is the case of Ashifa, which is perhaps being communalised in its worst form, an unfortunate part of the painful event. We all must remember that criminals like rapists have no religion.
Any one from any community could be their prey. They have nothing to do with your status, faith, power and position. So, it is not our, your or their issue. It is a serious concern of humanity as whole.
We surely need a tough legal structure to break the back of this unacceptable crime against much revered gender. Because that potentially matters. We hardly listen such bad news from certain Arab countries.
It must be admitted beyond prejudices that their laws, at least in securing the chastity of women, are effective and functionally correlated with society, as of now. Sooner or latter, we too shall have to come up with something stronger to protect the women folk, if the prevailing dirty mind set continues to dominate.
Strong system doesn't mean the society is exonerated. No way. Social institutions do have to deliver with more responsibilities and commitment to build up the crime free software of thoughts and beliefs in minds of boys well in the beginning with a proper gauge. It obviously starts from family to schools and to religious institutions.
We are also listening the weird justifications of raping women on streets. Some question their dressing styles and walking late night alone. Reasonable questioning and preaching regarding the decent dresses or so is a right to propagate by both, men and women. If done with manners, it would surely have its impact, too.
But that doesn't mean any female dressed not properly deserves to be molested and then tortured to death. That is a sick-mind thought. If, for just a moment, we accept such a strange view, but, what is the crime of little girls aging just 7 or 8 years to become the victim of rape and murder? Such minds need a permanent treatment.
Islam never teaches us that which is being put forth by some ill-minded to virtually support the crime. Rather, it enjoins upon both men and women to keep down (gaze-basar) their eyes. If women are accountable for their dresses or deeds, men too are equally answerable regarding the decency of their eyes and purity of heart and thoughts.

Grant McCann insists Woking will face a much-improved Peterborough United side in their FA Cup second round replay at the ABAX Stadium tomorrow (December 12).
Posh were lucky to escape with a 1-1 draw against the mid-table National League side in the original tie on December 3 when manager McCann admitted he employed the wrong tactics.
Posh boss Grant McCann.
Midfielder Leo Da Silva Lopes should return to action tomorrow after missing Saturday's (December 9) League One defeat at home to Blackburn, but captain Jack Baldwin is suspended after receiving a red card in the final stages of that game.
Key midfielder Anthony Grant has been passed fit to play after suffering a knock to the head against Blackburn as Posh chase an attractive third round tie at Championship promotion hopefuls Aston Villa.
‚ÄúWoking won't see the same Peterborough side,‚Äù McCann insisted. ‚ÄúI set the team up in the wrong way in that game. I am big enough to admit I made a mistake, but I don't make the same mistake twice.
‚ÄúOur approach will be completely different. Our incentive is to play much better than in the first game and to win the match.
‚ÄúThe players were hurting after the first tie. We have a massive point to prove. We want to prove we are a much better side than we showed in that match.
‚ÄúIt's a big game for us as no matter what competition we are playing in we need to start winning matches on a more consistent basis.
‚ÄúWe were disappointed with the Blackburn result at the weekend. We want to put that right by putting on a winning show for our fans.‚Äù
Alex Penny is favourite to replace Baldwin at right-back unless McCann chooses to revert to the wing-back system that served Posh well in the opening month of the season.
Posh have covered the ABAX Stadium pitch since the Blackburn game. Temperatures are expected top drop below freezing after the 7.45pm kick off.
Sony Corp. named Chief Financial Officer Kenichiro Yoshida as its new president and CEO on Friday, replacing Kazuo Hirai, who led a turnaround at the Japanese electronics and entertainment company and will stay on as chairman.
Yoshida has experience in Sony's U.S. operations, as well as its network, financial and investor relations businesses. Yoshida and Hirai were to talk to reporters later Friday. Sony's board members said they were surprised Hirai wanted to step down.
But Hirai said in a statement the timing was right to "pass the baton" to the next leadership.
Hirai became president and CEO in 2012, taking over from Howard Stringer, an American. He turned around an embattled Tokyo-based Sony, which had sunk into losses as its once prized TV business lost out to rival such as Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea.
Sony is now headed to booming profits because of its successful chips business, outpacing company targets. Yoshida, who now also serves as executive deputy president, promised to forge ahead with the changes Hirai had led to realize sold profits and growth to stay globally competitive.
As Sony moves into a new mid-range plan from April, Hirai felt Yoshida was the right person to lead the company, he said.

Cape Town: South Africa are trying to tune out the noise behind the scenes of a bad-tempered series against Australia and focus on the third Test, opening batsman Dean Elgar said on Monday.
"It's been a hectic last two weeks with everything that's been happening behind the scenes," Elgar told journalists.
The chief drama involves fast bowler Kagiso Rabada who on Monday gave his version of events in his appeal against a ban that could sideline him for the two remaining Tests of the series.
Rabada was banned for making physical contact with Australia captain Steve Smith during the second Test in Port Elizabeth.
Cricket South Africa said he would learn the result of his appeal by Wednesday, the day before the third Test starts at Newlands.
"We are just trying to isolate ourselves from that situation. As players, we can't influence what's happening. It will be nice to put it behind us.
"There's been so much noise and people have forgotten there's a great Test series going on between two extremely strong and competitive teams."
Players of both teams welcomed the break they had enjoyed after South Africa levelled the four-match series with a six-wicket win in Port Elizabeth last week.
"It's been nice to get some time off," said Elgar.
The Australians behaved like regular tourists during what opening batsman Cameron Bancroft described as "four really important days off" ‚Äî although he said he would not be in a hurry to get into a boat again after being seasick while shark-diving.
Some players had explored Cape Town tourist attractions such as Table Mountain, while others had gone on safari.
'Just as guilty'
The break over, hostilities are set to resume.
Bancroft told Australian journalists that his team would likely remind South African fast bowler Vernon Philander of a tweet, which the player claimed was as a result of a "hack" of his account, accusing Smith of being "just as guilty" in the Rabada incident.
Elgar said he did not expect Philander to be too concerned about anything the Australians might say. "I think he'll take it in his stride. I'm sure he'll expect them to say something on the field and he'll be prepared for that."
Elgar acknowledged that feelings had run high in the first two Tests.
"There has been a lot of needles," he said. "It comes from both sides and it's what you expect when you are playing against quality opposition. The intensity should be there. I think that's what makes this (Test) format very much exciting."
The match will be played on the same pitch that was used for South Africa's New Year Test against India, which was effectively completed in three days, with 40 wickets falling for only 760 runs, an average of 19 runs a wicket.
The groundsman said the pitch would be less lively than it was for the India Test, although he expected it to have enough pace and bounce to give assistance to seam bowlers, with some help to spin bowlers later in the match.
On Monday the pitch had an even covering of grass, although it was thinner near both ends after being worn bare during the India Test.
"I would like to see this match going to five days, although it depends on the skill of the bowlers," said Flint.
While South Africa sweated on the availability of Rabada, Australia had concerns over their spearhead, Mitchell Starc, who did not bowl on Monday because of what was believed to be a calf strain.
Bancroft said he was not aware of a problem with the tall left-armer: "In the past, he's bowled a couple of days out and had that third day as a rest day."
While Starc sat out training, fellow speedsters Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins had a full-scale workout. All-rounder Mitchell Marsh, who suffered a groin strain during the second Test, bowled at a gentle pace but was expected to be fully fit by Thursday.
Several books have been written about the Ukraine genocide through famine, known as the Holodomor. MACOMB DAILY PHOTO
The Michigan Governor¬ís Genocide Studies Council will pursue developing a curriculum to educate students about the genocide through starvation of the Ukrainian population in the early 1930s.
Council Coordinator Judith Kovach said it will embark on developing lessons about the Ukrainian genocide once the council approves curricula for the Holocaust and the Armenia Genocide at its Jan. 9 meeting at the Holocaust Memorial Center in Farmington Hills.
¬ìIt will happen,¬î Kovach said.
Inclusion of the Ukrainian genocide, known as the ¬ìHolodomor,¬î in school lessons has been pushed recently by local Ukrainian-Americans as part of an overall national effort over the past 15 years to bring more attention to it. Establishment of a Holodomor memorial, advocated by U.S. Rep. Sander Levin, was dedicated in Washington, D.C., in 2015. Last month, the Michigan lawmakers last month passed a resolution recognizing the Holodomor introduced by state Sen. Steve Bieda of Warren and state reps. Patrick Green of Warren and Martin Howrylak. Other states have recognized it.
¬ìThat is wonderful,¬î said Marie Zarycky of Warren, one of Ukrainian activists, of Kovach¬ís comments. ¬ìIt is important because we don¬ít want this to happen again. We have to call attention to all wrongdoing against humanity, and we have to name them.¬î
Advertisement
Kovach, a psychologist, agreed.
¬ìWe want the curriculum to help children not be bystanders but stand up to genocide,¬î she said. ¬ìIt goes beyond a history lesson and really teaches children how to use this information for moral development.¬î
The Holodomor resulted in the death by famine of 3 million to 5 million Ukrainians under Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin to break the resistance to Soviet totalitarian rule and destroy Ukraine as a nation.
Zarycky, a member of the Holodomor Remembrance Committee of the Detroit Regional Council of the Ukrainian National Women¬ís League of America, and other metro-Detroit activists have been pushing for the inclusion and attending meetings of the council, which was created by Gov. Rick Snyder in 2016. They have been somewhat frustrated by the council¬ís response and noted that all 15 council members are associated with the Holocaust or Armenian genocide.
But Kovach said the council wants to first approve the curricula for the Holocaust and Armenian genocide before working on the Holodomor¬ís lesson plan. She noted the council¬ís members are volunteers and have limited time to devote.
Education about the extermination of 6 million Jews during World War II and Armenian Genocide from 1915 to 1917 was required in Michigan schools beginning in September under a new state law though a formal lesson plan wasn¬ít approved, Kovach explained.
She said the council ultimately wants to develop curriculum for not only the Holodomor but for genocides in Rwanda, Cambodia and Bosnia. The council has a termination date of next August, but Kovach said members plan to continue through another mechanism, perhaps as a nonprofit organization.
Vera Andrushkiw, president of the Detroit Regional Council of the Ukrainian National Women¬ís League of America, said the Holodomor didn¬ít get a great deal of attention in the years immediate following because Stalin and Russia was a crucial U.S. ally during World War II and Ukraine remained part of the Soviet Union until its dismantling.
¬ìThere was an in-born fear in people living in Ukraine,¬î she said. ¬ìThey refused to talk about it.¬î
She noted that while the Holocaust has been the subject of many books and films, the Holodomor has not, although a movie called, ¬ìBitter Harvest,¬î and a book called, ¬ìRed Famine Stalin¬ís War on Ukraine¬î by Anne Applebaum, were released this year.

A ¬£7.5 million care village built by the private health firm Bupa in the centre of Scunthorpe has opened six weeks ahead of schedule.
The Scunthorpe Telegraph has been given a tour of the new Sandhills Court complex at the corner of Doncaster Road and Exeter Road in the town centre. To see inside it, click on the video at the top of this page.
The first resident to sign in at the ¬£750-a-week care village has given it the thumbs-up.
Mother-of-three Anna Korczrewski, 90, said: "It's a first class home and the staff are brilliant."
Anna will be well known by many Scunthorpe people as the receptionist at the former Garbo's and Pepper Lounge on the High Street for more than 30 years.
She was joined this week by a second resident and three more will join them next week as Sandhills starts to fill up.
Twenty-seven of the 70 employees have so far been recruited.
Among the recruits is mother-of-two Andrea Jetten, 52, a former nurse at York Royal Infirmary.

Mrs Jetten, who hails from West Butterwick, used to run her own care home business called Domus in York.
She said: "The next few weeks will continue to be busy as more residents and staff join us. We're really looking forward to meeting them all.
"Our rates are competitive for the quality of care we are offering. Our research around the area showed rates vary between ¬£600 and ¬£800 a week."
Sandhills offers a cinema, a hair and beauty salon and a cafe, as well as landscaped gardens.

Staff at the nearby Royal Hotel have offered to equip a bar in the cinema.
Mrs Jetten said she was hoping - subject to risk assessment - to bring in a house cat or dog and create a mini bowling green on the lawns.
She was also aiming to forge links with two local schools in the hope that the chidlren would "adopt" some of the residents.
Mrs Jetten admitted that she and her colleagues were mystified over the choice of Sandhills as the name for the centre and would welcome clues from local residents.
The 77 bedrooms and flats are accommodated in three suites and have been named Appleby, Redbourn and Frodingham in honour of the local steel industry.
Head chef is Scunthorpe-born chef Dave Elsom, 50, who for 27 years worked for the local NHS Trust as catering manager.
In recent years Dave has worked for the Hull-based charity Case, teaching disabled people how to cook. His wife Hayley still works at Scunthorpe General Hospital as a chef.
The Mayor of North Lincolnshire Councillor Peter Clark will officially open the new home on February 21.
Sandhills Court is built on the site of the former Gala bingo hall and Arrow Park bowling centre and Tito's night club.
Bupa also owns the 56-bed Edmond House care home on Everest Road, Ashby.
UPDATE: On 27 November 2017, the Buganda Road Court charged the Red Pepper editors and directors with seven counts including libel and offensive communication (HRNJ-Uganda).
This statement was originally published on rsf.org on 23 November 2017.
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) calls for the immediate release of eight senior employees of the Kampala-based Red Pepper tabloid, arrested on 21 November, and for the reopening of the newspaper, which was closed the same day.
The eight employees arrested during an anti-terrorist police raid on Red Pepper's headquarters were directors Patrick Mugumya, Arinaitwe Rugyendo, James Mujuni and Johnson Musinguzi Byarabaha, financial manager Richard Tusiime and editors Ben Byarabaha, Richard Kintu and Tumusiime Francis Tinywana.
According to police sources, they are being held at Nalufenya detention centre in Jinja, a city 85 km east of Kampala. The centre is known for the use of brutal interrogation methods. They are said to be accused of endangering state security but the charges have not yet been confirmed.
The arrests were prompted by a 20 November article headlined M7 plots to remove Kagame, which claimed that Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni (nicknamed "M7") was plotting against his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame. According to local sources, Red Pepper took the article from a Rwandan online newspaper without verifying the information.
'This kind of reaction by the authorities is completely disproportionate," RSF said. "Charging journalists with endangering security because of an article? Sending anti-terrorist police to a newspaper? What is the Museveni government afraid of? We call on the authorities to free the arrested journalists at once, and to allow the newspaper to resume operating freely, in accordance with Uganda's laws."
The raid began when the anti-terrorist police arrived at Red Pepper's headquarters with a search warrant and surrounded the building. In the course of the search, they examined all the computers and electronic equipment and other documents used by the newspaper's journalists.
Referring to the newspaper's headquarters as a "crime scene," police spokesman Emilian Kayima said it was closed "until further notice."
The Ugandan government has of late taken several measures to restrict media freedom and intimidate journalists. This has included banning live transmission of parliamentary debates and interrogating newspaper publishers.

ISLAMABAD - Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-Fazl) chief Fazlur Rehman has developed serious differences with the government on the way, he claims it is ‚Äúselectively‚Äù implementing the National Action Plan (NAP) and the rulers' intention to extend the tenure of the military courts in Pakistan.
Sources aware of the developments informed The Nation that in the last meeting with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, which had taken place a few days ago, the JUI-F Chief, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, had made it clear to him that his party would not support any move to give extension to the military courts in Pakistan.
The military courts were given constitutional cover through 21st Constitutional Amendment passed in the beginning of January 2015 for a period of two years, and now the timeframe for these military courts would be expiring and would require grant of extension through parliament, if the government wanted to keep these courts intact.
Otherwise, these courts would seize to exist after lapse of the timeline given to these courts through the 21st constitutional amendment.
Sources in the parliament informed The Nation that the ruling PML-N wanted to extend the period for those courts for another two years and there was also proposal to keep those courts on a permanent basis till the time the menace of terrorism was weeded out from the society.
Sources in the JUI-F confirmed to The Nation that party chief Fazlur Rehman had made it clear to the government that this time his party would come out in protest, if any attempt to make the military courts permanent was made through a constitutional cover.
Sources further said that the JUI-F wanted a debate in the parliament on the efficacy of those courts and the achievements made during the two years of their existence before considering grant of any extension.
The JUI-F chief was of the view that instead of running a parallel judicial system the government must focus on strengthening the existing system to make it deliver.
It is pertinent to mention here that the JUI-F along with Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) had abstained from voting on the 21st Constitutional Amendment but the reason of their staying away from the process was not the formation of the military courts but the definition of terrorism and its linkage with religion.
Though the JUI-F chief was appeased by the ruling PML-N that the concerns of the party would be addressed by adopting another amendment to rectify the things in 21st Constitutional Amendment but he was still waiting for the fulfilment of that commitment made with him, a source in the JUI-F informed The Nation.
The JUI-F was also having serious issues with the ruling PML-N on the federal government's policies toward Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government.
Both the coalition partners also have differences over the Fata reforms as the JUI-F is opposing the merger of the area in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and wants to see its separate identity intact.
Parliamentary sources said that the JUI-F leadership was just exerting pressure on the government to get some of its demands met, and the dissent to the military courts issue was just for the consumption of the diehard vote back of the party, particularly in Khyber-Pakhtunkhawa.
These sources said that the JUI-F chief was unhappy with the prime minister for noncompliance of the coalition agreement and not giving them the promised ministerial slot to the party vacated by its member Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri.
Similarly, he is also putting the stake on the slot of the Council for Islamic Ideology (CII) chairmanship, which was vacated by the party's central leader Maulana Mohammad Khan Sheerani in the second half of last month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Regardless of a return to solid economic growth, the risk of sharp appreciation in the yen means Japan's central bank would be in no rush to exit its ultra-loose monetary policy, say sources familiar with the bank's thinking.

Stubbornly low inflation would also make the Bank of Japan hesitant to taper its huge crisis-mode stimulus programme and shift away from rock-bottom interest rates too quickly.
While the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target remains elusive, its money printing strategy has brought about a desirable depreciation in the yen.
‚ÄúYen moves have been, and will continue to be, very important factors for BOJ policy,‚Äù said one of the sources.
Though the BOJ officially does not target the yen as it would invite accusations of currency manipulation from G20 countries, arresting abrupt yen rises has been a priority for policymakers in supporting the export-reliant economy.
‚ÄúThe BOJ's main worry is the risk of causing a yen spike, as a weak yen is among the few accomplishments of its policy,‚Äù said Koichi Haji, chief economist at NLI Research Institute.
‚ÄúThe yen could rise sharply the moment the BOJ signals the chance of normalizing policy. That makes it really hard for the bank to head for an exit.‚Äù
DANGERS
Letting policy be held hostage by the yen means the BOJ would fall further behind its U.S. and European counterparts emerging from their easing cycles.
The Federal Reserve is set to raise rates on Wednesday and predict more hikes next year, while the European Central Bank and the Bank of England hold their policy meetings on Thursday.
Perpetuating the ultra-easy stance would also leave the BOJ with scant ammunition to fend off a recession if the global environment turns sour.
With financial institutions complaining of the hit from ultra-low rates on their margins, the BOJ too has been dropping subtle hints it could edge away from crisis-mode stimulus earlier than expected.
That is unsurprising with consumption picking up, the economy expanding an annualized 2.5 percent in July-September to mark the best uninterrupted run of growth in 16 years and job availability nearing a 44-year high.
But any hike in the BOJ's yield targets, which could come next year, would be a modest, one-off move rather than the start of a full-fledged rate hike cycle, the sources said.
‚ÄúWith the inflation outlook uncertain, there's no need to rush,‚Äù said one of the sources.
RECURRING POLITICAL PRESSURE
Many analysts expect core consumer inflation, now at 0.8 percent, to slow next year unless firms pay heed to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's calls to hike wages by 3 percent - no easy task given how wary they had been in raising salaries so far.
While Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has signaled the bank could adjust rates before his price target is met, many policymakers feel that inflation needs to exceed 1 percent to even ponder a rate hike, the sources say.
An impending leadership change at the BOJ, as Kuroda ends his term in April, further complicates the outlook since candidates for the job include Abe's former aide Etsuro Honda - a vocal advocate of aggressive easing.
Most of all, the BOJ wants to avoid triggering a yen spike that could choke off the recovery, the sources say.
Whenever the yen has spiked, BOJ officials have come under political pressure to act. Kuroda's predecessor, Masaaki Shirakawa, was heavily criticized for being too slow in responding to the pain from sharp yen gains.
The priority Abe puts on stock prices also makes it hard for the BOJ to slow purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETF), despite criticism from investors it is distorting prices.
The BOJ is already slowing government bond purchases to around 40 trillion yen ($352 billion) per year - roughly half the amount it loosely pledges to buy.
And yet, its balance sheet - roughly the size of Japan's 500-trillion-yen economy - keeps rising at a much faster pace than that of the Fed and the ECB.
By raising its yield targets and slowing asset purchases next year, the BOJ could stock up some tools to fight any shocks to the economy, analysts say.
Otherwise, it may be forced to deepen negative rates, a hugely unpopular move that may destabilize the banking system, or opt for extreme steps like bankrolling government debt, they say.
‚ÄúThe economy is doing remarkably well and may be near its peak,‚Äù said a third source. ‚ÄúIf not now, I wonder whether the BOJ could ever start normalizing policy.‚Äù

TV's Jeff Stelling is set to meet with a potential investor to discuss a potential takeover of Hartlepool United.
The presenter of Sky Sport's Soccer Saturday and passionate Poolie says he will meet the unnamed party next week but urged fans not to get their hopes up just yet.
Fans at the Vic
He said: ‚ÄúI have got a couple of meetings next week, but I don't know if there is any likelihood anything will come of it.
‚ÄúIt is very speculative at this stage.‚Äù
Jeff told how he is still in touch with another potential investor who showed an interest in the club several weeks ago.
He said: ‚ÄúThey have been looking at the books and seeing if it is feasible to go ahead or not.‚Äù
Jeff said there is work going on behind the scenes with a view to the setting up of a consortium of investors to get together and save the club from administration.
He reasserted his intention to put some of his own money in as part of a long-term plan for the club.
Jeff added: ‚ÄúMy would-be investor is going to try to talk to some of the people who have shown an interest to see if they could put together a consortium that could raise enough to keep the club going for a couple of years.
‚ÄúI would be a small scale player with the amount of money needed.
‚ÄúYou have got to try to talk to as many people as you can.‚Äù
Hartlepool United issued a fresh appeal for investment this week as the club faces a race against time.
A number of bills are understood to be overdue, as well as wages and running costs to cover between now and the end of the month needed.
It comes after a hoped for deal with Hartlepool entrepreneur Chris Musgrave broke down last week.
A club statement released on Wednesday said there have been further and new expressions of interest.
The statement read: ‚ÄúWhat is clear is that if timescales were permitting there is little doubt that an iconic club such as Hartlepool United FC would have little difficulty attracting a new equity owner, who is looking to invest in and engage in owning a football club for the long term.
‚ÄúThere have been several expressions of interest of some people willing to join together as part of a consortium, but may not have known others to join in with. ‚ÄúWith this in mind therefore we would urge anyone that is thinking along these lines that they should contact the solicitor with their appetite for equity investment and proof of funds for that level.‚Äù
All potential equity investor enquiries can be directed to Geoff.cunningham@walkermorris.co.uk.
It was revealed last month that the club was facing financial difficulties.
There has been a huge response from fans, including a sellout for the home game against Wrexham which saw 5,500 tickets sold to football supporters nationwide rallying to help the club.
A crowdfunding page has also been set up and raised more than ¬£80,000 for the cause.

After a year off, local residents can once again board the ‚ÄúGhost Train‚Äù in Griffith Park as part of the 17th annual Halloween-themed event staged by the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum.
The Live Steamers is a nonprofit of train enthusiasts who convert their year-round 1/8-scale trains and track system into a haunted ride for guests across roughly 30 professional Halloween displays.
Diana Manchester, the nonprofit's art director, said the organization's members are excited to return after taking last year off for facility maintenance, and they hope past attendees will enjoy the new displays.
‚ÄúMany of the displays will be ones people have seen over the years, but we always try and change it with twists and turns that we've never done before,‚Äù she said.
Returning will be a steam engine operated by skeletons, a pirates' cove and an abandoned mine.
For the first time, there will be a ‚Äúzombie containment zone,‚Äù which will be a fake warehouse dedicated to the undead. A 350-pound, fire-breathing, metal dragon will also debut this year.
Manchester said she likes to remind attendees about Ghost Train's family-friendly atmosphere, with no actors in scary costumes jumping out of dark areas, no blood and no gore.
Gary Baker, who has produced the event since its inception, will return this year. He also produces a Halloween festival called ‚ÄúMidsummer Scream‚Äù at the Long Beach Convention Center.
The Ghost Train is also an annual fundraiser for the nonprofit to help pay for maintenance of the 13-acre railroad facility and museum.
The Live Steamers was founded in 1956 by lovers of all things railroad. Many of the trains are owned, operated or renovated by the group's volunteer members, who also operate the Ghost Train.
This year's Ghost Train will run for 11 nights from 7 to 10 p.m. over three weekends this month, starting on Oct. 13. The event will also be held on Halloween, which falls on a Tuesday this year.

Rawalpindi - A court of law on Tuesday sentenced a man to 20 years in prison and imposed a fine of Rs 100,000 fine for raping a 13-year-old girl on gunpoint in 2015.
The court also sent a female doctor of private clinic behind the bars for 3 years for carrying out the abortion of the rape victim against a hefty bribe paid by the rapist. ASJ Taxila Malik Ahmed Arshad Mehmood Jasra has convicted and awarded 20-year rigorous imprisonment to Muhammad Ashfaq, the resident of Bahter and local leader of PML-N.
However, two other accused Amir and Asif, the brothers of rape convict Ashfaq, have been acquitted due to lack of evidences against them. Nasir Bilal Advocate, the counsel presenting the rape victim HS, earlier, pleaded to the judge to award the hardest punishments to the accused as they had ruined the life of an innocent young girl.
According to the complainant, Ashfaq, who is her husband's cousin took her daughter HS in June 2015 to his house to give company to his daughter Zainab. Ashfaq‚Äòs wife had separated from him.
She added that after taking the girl home, Ashfaq raped her thrice on gunpoint and impregnated her. The victim did not inform her mother about the incidence out of fear of her uncle.
However, after a passage of few months, she complained of stomach pain. Ashfaq then took her to a private clinic in Basti Wah, against the victim's mother's wish, and bribed Dr Talat to conduct an abortion on the girl.
Police lodged case and held accused. The accused were released on bail by a court of law.
Later on they were tried in ASJ Taxila Court. As many as 13 prosecution witnesses appeared before court and recorded their statements in HS rape case.
‚ÄúI've listened to that album so many times, I thought, ‚ÄòI've so got this!'‚Äù she said with a wide grin. ‚ÄúBut as soon as I started trying to figure out actually what he did and how he did it, I started wondering what I'd got myself into.‚Äù
Better standards are in place in British Columbia, meaning less fish have escaped, reports show
The federal government isn't properly managing the risks that farmed salmon pose to their wild counterparts, nor is it doing enough to ensure Canada is meeting its international commitments on biodiversity and sustainable development, Canada's environmental watchdog says.
In a series of new audits released Tuesday, environment commissioner Julie Gelfand takes a closer look at Canada's management of the $1-billion salmon farming industry, which she warns is lacking when it comes to assessing the risk that diseases among farmed fish pose to wild salmon.
The department has no requirement to monitor the health of wild salmon or the status of the ocean floor beneath penned salmon farms, said Gelfand, and the department is also providing better funding for research related to fish farms than it is for research to help monitor their impact.
‚ÄúThe department is at risk of being seen to promote aquaculture over the protection of wild salmon,‚Äù Gelfand said after the reports were tabled in Parliament.
The research gaps are extensive enough that there's no way to determine the impact of fish farms on wild fish, she said. Those gaps include a lack of knowledge about the risk of disease, as well as the impact of the drugs used to treat those diseases. Canada also lacks an impact threshold to determine when to shut down or limit fish farming, she added.
Canada also lacks standards for the nets used to contain farmed salmon in the ocean ‚Äî a particular problem in the Atlantic, where heavy storms often batter salmon farms and destroy nets.

In 2015, 40,000 salmon escaped from farms in Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Better standards are in place in British Columbia, where fewer escapes have occurred, the report says.
Gelfand's spring reports also look at Canada's commitment to the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, both of which, she warns, could become the latest international environment agreements Canada signs but does little to actually implement.
She cited a lack of government leadership to address the targets in those agreements, saying there is no way to properly assess how effectively government policies can contribute to meeting those goals.
The agenda for sustainable development is an international agreement for countries to work towards sustainable environmental, economic and social development, including gender equality, eliminating poverty, climate action and industrial innovation.
Canada committed to the 2030 agenda in 2015 and recommitted to it last year, but the audit says the government hasn't yet put in place the fundamental requirements to do more than pay it lip service.
‚ÄúThe federal government committed to implementing the 2030 agenda three years ago, but again, it is not ready to respect its international commitment,‚Äù Gelfand said. ‚ÄúWhen will it be ready?‚Äù
The audit report looked at the period between September 2015 and November 2017. The federal budget tabled in February promised nearly $50 million between now and 2030 to create a specific government unit to oversee the agenda, as well as to fund monitoring and reporting by Statistics Canada, Gelfand acknowledged.
The statistics agency also expects this spring to have a data portal ready to report on the Canadian indicators around the UN 2030 agenda. That could address one of Gelfand's concerns that there are too many departments assigned as co-leads on the agenda, leaving no one to take full ownership of or leadership on the file.
‚ÄúIn my opinion, it is difficult to move forward with 10 hands on the wheel,‚Äù she says.
Gelfand's third audit this spring looked at another unmet Canadian UN environment commitment, this one the UN Convention on Biological Diversity ‚Äî a legally binding treaty acknowledging that a global decline in biodiversity is one of the ‚Äúmost serious issues facing humanity.‚Äù
Canada has had a biodiversity strategy under the convention since 1995; in 2002, signatories committed to reducing the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010. New targets were set for 2020 after that original deadline went wanting.
Environment Canada isn't taking the necessary steps to hit the 2020 targets, Gelfand found, focusing its efforts on international meetings and creating national committees rather than analyzing whether its actions will do anything to help. There is also no comprehensive monitoring or reporting on whether there is any progress to meeting the 2020 targets.

State and federal courts lifted the two primary obstacles Arkansas faced Monday in its plan to execute eight inmates before the end of April, but the executions of the first two inmates scheduled to die remained in limbo.
The decisions from the U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals and the state Supreme Court were among a flurry of legal actions that threatened to stop a series of lethal injections that, if carried out, would mark the most inmates put to death by a state in such a short period since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.
The state Supreme Court had earlier stayed the executions of two men originally scheduled to be put to death Monday night. Separately, a federal appeals court overturned U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker's decision to halt the executions over the use of lethal injection drug midazolam, but the state Supreme Court's rulings remain in place.
‚ÄúUnder our view of the correct legal standard, we cannot agree with the district court that the prisoners have demonstrated a significant possibility of establishing a known and available alternative that would significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain,‚Äù the court said.
A little over an hour later, the state Supreme Court lifted a judge's ruling that had effectively blocked the executions by prohibiting the state from using its supply of vecuronium bromide, one of the other lethal injection drugs. A medical supply company said it was misled by the state and that the drug was sold for medical purposes, not executions.
Earlier Monday, the state Supreme Court issued a 4-3 decision granting stays for Don Davis and Bruce Ward. The inmates wanted stays of execution while the U.S. Supreme Court takes up a separate case concerning access to independent mental health experts by defendants. The U.S. high court is set to hold oral arguments on April 24.
Three Arkansas justices dissented, with Associate Justice Shawn Womack writing that Ward and Davis ‚Äúhad their day in court, the jury spoke, and decades of appeals have occurred. The families are entitled to closure and finality of the law.‚Äù
The inmates' attorneys argued that their clients were denied access to independent mental health experts, saying Ward has a lifelong history of severe mental illness and that Davis has an IQ in the range of intellectual disability.
Atty. Gen. Leslie Rutledge's office said she would appeal the state ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. Rutledge said in a status update with the U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals that she believed the state court's ruling was based on a misinterpretation of federal law.
‚ÄúThis decision was not unanimous and the dissenting opinions reflect the harm the delays cause the families of the victims and it also expresses my frustration in the continued delayed justice,‚Äù Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who set the execution dates, said in a statement.
The death warrants for Davis and Ward expire at midnight, and it was not clear whether Hutchinson would immediately set new dates for the men.
The Arkansas high court already had issued one stay for Ward after a Jefferson County judge said she didn't have the authority to halt Ward's execution. Ward's attorneys have argued he is a diagnosed schizophrenic with no rational understanding of his impending execution.
The back-and-forth with the courts came as the state seeks to execute eight prisoners before its supply of the sedative midazolam expires at the end of the month. If court proceedings are pushed into May, Arkansas won't be able to carry out the executions with the drugs it has on hand.
The state was still moving forward with plans to conduct the Monday night executions in the event that all stays were lifted, with Davis being served his last meal of fried chicken, rolls, beans, mashed potatoes and strawberry cake.
The eight inmates also asked the U.S. Supreme Court for a stay until the high court rules on their request to reconsider whether to weigh in a state court decision upholding Arkansas' lethal injection law.
It's unclear whether the state may face additional challenges over its execution drugs. McKesson, the supplier that sued Arkansas to try and block the use of vecuronium bromide, asked to drop its case after Baker's order but has left open the possibility it may refile its lawsuit if executions move forward.
Meanwhile, the Arkansas Supreme Court also barred a state judge who blocked the multiple execution plan from taking up any death penalty cases after he participated in a protest where he appeared to mimic a death row inmate about to receive a lethal injection.
Justices reassigned any death penalty cases from Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge Wendell Griffen, who banned the state from using the vecuronium bromide obtained. After issuing the order, Griffen participated in an anti-death penalty demonstration where he was strapped to a cot. The high court asked a disciplinary panel to consider whether Griffen violated the code of conduct for judges.
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan said that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif is using Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz to create a rift between country's institutions.
"Nawaz is not fighting for any rights rather he is trying to hide his corruption", he said while addressing a press conference on Friday.
If money laundering allegations are proven against Nawaz then all of his assets abroad would be frozen, he claimed. "An attack on Supreme Court is an attack on democracy," he added.
The PTI chief also spoke on Fata reforms and said the government has no other option than to integrate Fata and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
"The conditions in tribal areas especially north and south Waziristan are really bad," he remarked, adding, "It is important that people from those areas also get representation in the provincial assembly."
If Fata reforms are not implemented that it would affect people in tribal areas the most, he said, stressing that the process should start by 2018.
During the occasion, former district general secretary JUI-F Mufti Sajjad also announced to join PTI.
‚ÄúIt is necessary to eliminate the menace of corruption for a strong and prosperous nation,‚Äù said Mufti Sajjad.
SHELBURNE, Ont. ‚Äî Police west of Toronto say a suspect in the death of a 30-year-old woman from Brampton, Ont., has been found dead.
Peel Regional Police say 46-year-old Nicholas Anthony Young was found dead in Shelburne, Ont., on Friday.
They say his death has been deemed not suspicious.
Young was the subject of a Canada-wide warrant for second-degree murder in the death of Hoden Said, whose body was found in a home in Brampton last Saturday.

The most preferred unknown source of funding for Congress was "sale of coupons" under the party collected a total of Rs 115.64 crore which formed 91.69 percent of the party's total income from unknown sources during FY 2016-17.
The ADR advocates that no part of the Form 24A submitted by political parties providing details of donations above Rs 20,000 should be left blank and that full details of all donors should be made available for public scrutiny under the RTI.
"Some countries where this is done include Bhutan, Nepal, Germany, France, Italy, Brazil, Bulgaria, the US, and Japan. In none of these countries is it possible for nearly 50 percent of the source of funds to be unknown, but at present, it is so in India," the ADR report pointed out.

Radhanpur: The state highways are smooth but the journeys are long and arduous.
So they take refuge in their smartphones, mostly encased in plastic, shutting themselves off from the rest of the world.
The occasional chuckle from the youngsters and the sound leaking from ear plugs give some hint about the source of entertainment ‚Äî mostly video clips of Bollywood flicks, regional albums or comedy clips.
Prince Parmar is on one such bus, travelling to Gandhidham, a town in Kutch district, from Patan town.
The 23-year-old youth, son of a landless farmer, works as a "supervisor" in a garments company in Gandhidham for a meagre salary of Rs 10,000 per month.
"And they deduct half the salary if you take even three days off," Parmar, a Dalit, says.
While sharing his angst and frustration, Parmar suddenly asks, "How much do you earn? What did you study?"
As Gujarat prepares to vote in the second and last phase of the election on 14 December, Parmar's question takes on added import, reflecting not just the many worries of youth in the state but also sending out a message for parties competing for power.
A recurrent highlight of a nearly 550-km road trip across north Gujarat is the Gujarati youth's curiosity about the world of white-collar jobs and their sense of astonishment over the perks and privileges that come with it.
Koradiya Wasimbhai Mehbubbhai, a resident of Radhanpore's Jain Boarding locality, drops in at the makeshift poll office of the Congress with two of his friends.
Mehbub says he finished school and underwent vocational training at an ITI (Industrial Training Institute).
When a local Congress worker interjects saying he is now doing sundry jobs to eke out a living, the 20-year-old snaps.
"What he is saying is not true. I am looking for a good job," Mehbub says, his voice choking with anguish and a sense of shame.
Later, walking towards his shanty on the fringes of the town, Mehbub narrates how circumstances forced him to quit studies after high school. His father is a driver, who earns Rs 5,000 per month.
Minutes later, Mehbub, in a manner nearly identical to Parmar, inquires about this correspondent's job profile, qualifications and salary.
"Did they also pay you separately for this trip over and above the salary? Do they have entrance exams for the job?" Mehbub asks.
En route to Patan's Sami tehsil, Deepakbhai Devipujak, a resident of the district's Baspa village, pulls out his China-made tablet to show images of devastation caused by the July 2017 floods in his area.
"All our standing crop was levelled by the surge of water. And till date, we have not received compensation for the loss despite numerous promises by the authorities," he says.
Deepak says he will pursue a law degree, in accordance with his farmer father's wish. However, only reservations can ensure a government job that can secure his future, he affirms.
"Our caste numbers around 1.5 crore across the country. We are listed as Backward Castes by the Gujarat government. But we want reservations to end the discrimination against us and ensure our proper representation in the government," he says.
The Devipujak community, listed among the Nomadic Tribes and Denotified Tribes in Gujarat, fall in the OBC category. But they have been demanding a separate quota within the 27 percent reservation for OBCs as they are too marginalised to compete with other groups.
In Vadgam constituency's Chhapi village, Bhawesh Kumar echoes a similar sense of despair. The 29-year-old, who has completed his MA and BEd, is desperately seeking a government job but runs a mobile repairing shop out of necessity.
These voices have little presence in the prevailing political discourse of the state, saddled by raging debates on wild conspiracy theories and a heady dose of religious polarisation.
The Patidar agitation for reservations, led by Hardik Patel, reflected similar frustration even among the youth of the landed Patel community.
According to the RBI's handbook of statistics, Gujarat's growth driven by capital-intensive industries has not generated adequate amount of jobs, and in recent years the rate of manufacturing output has steadily fallen.
Small and medium-scale enterprises have also shut shop more than ever before, especially after the introduction of GST and demonetisation, resulting in further shrinking of job opportunities, data reveals.
Will Gujarat's youth make their presence felt in this election? Counting day on December 18 should provide some answers.

LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - European shares will end 2018 just ahead of their January peak, recovering from current levels as a resilient economy gradually overcomes a temporary slowdown and corporate earnings continue to rise, a Reuters poll showed.

The poll was taken May 15-30, largely before a mounting political crisis in Italy sparked worries over a possible breakup of the euro zone, triggering a heavy sell-off in Italian assets.
The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark index is expected to reach 406 points by year-end, according to the poll of 29 brokers, fund managers and analysts, up 5.6 percent from Tuesday's close and 4.3 percent on the year.
That will be enough for the index to surpass a 29-month high of 403.7 points it reached in January.
Euro zone blue-chips are expected to rise a bit further, up 7.9 percent from Tuesday's close to 3,700 points, according to the median of 37 responses.
Prospects for European shares faded at the beginning of the year as economic growth slowed more than expected, raising concerns there will be no return to boom.
But analysts were optimistic economic activity should be robust enough to modestly prop up shares and company earnings.
‚ÄúFor now, synchronized economic expansion, solid earnings growth and still relatively low volatility levels look supportive for global equity markets‚Äù, Deutsche Asset Management analysts said.
According to Thomson Reuters IBES estimates, earnings for STOXX 600 companies are expected to grow 8.7 percent in 2018 on revenues up 5.1 percent.
A majority of investors in Europe answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù when asked if they thought global stocks would continue to rise in 2018.
Among the risks identified by investors are Italy, Brexit talks, a U.S.-China trade war, oil prices surging above 100 dollars a barrel or international tensions involving Iran or North Korea.
‚ÄúThe economic picture stays positive but political risks are the top concern,‚Äù said Tomas Hildebrandt, senior portfolio manager at Evli Bank in Helsinki.
A faster-than-expected acceleration in U.S. inflation and interest rates is also seen as a threat after a rise in American wages took the market by surprise in February.
With the current rise in the dollar, investors said they believed the biggest risk of a sell-off was in emerging markets, where returns looked less attractive given rising U.S. government bond yields.
MEETOTAMULLA, Sri Lanka ‚Äî Rescuers on Monday were digging through heaps of mud and trash that collapsed onto a clutch of homes near a garbage dump outside Sri Lanka's capital, killing at least 29 people and possibly burying dozens more.
Hundreds of people had been living in the working-class neighbourhood on the fringe of the towering dump in Meetotamulla, a town near Colombo, when a huge mound collapsed Friday night during a celebration for the local new year, damaging at least 150 homes.
By Monday morning, authorities had pulled 29 bodies from beneath the debris, according to lawyer Nuwan Bopage, who has worked with local residents to protest the dump. Authorities were unsure how many more people could still be trapped, but about 30 were reported missing, Bopage said.
Soldiers were digging with backhoes and shovels, as relatives of the missing pointed out where their houses once stood amid coconut, mango and banana trees. Those homes now lay in piles of collapsed concrete walls encased in a wall of mud up to 8 metres (25 feet) high and mixed with plastic bags, broken glass and other trash. Bicycles and auto-rickshaws, the three-wheeled vehicles used as local taxis, were crushed or lying topsy-turvy.
More than 600 of the area's residents were sheltering in nearby schools, while 11 people were being treated at a hospital for injuries.
One auto-rickshaw driver described a narrow escape. He was returning home with his wife, two sons and daughter when they stepped out from his rickshaw and his daughter said the ground seemed to be moving beneath her feet.
‚ÄúThere was a strong wind from the side of the dump, and my daughter shouted that the mound is splitting,‚Äù Rasika Sanjeewa, 41, said Monday. ‚ÄúSuddenly, one slice of the mound came crashing down. The whole area was shaking.‚Äù
Debris blocked them from fleeing immediately, but eventually they found a way out, Sanjeewa said. When they arrived later at their friends' home, where they had planned to celebrate the new year, they found it buried and their friends dead ‚Äî a mother and daughter who worked as daily wage labourers.
The prime minister vowed over the weekend to shut down the dump, which has absorbed much of Colombo's garbage over several years amid heavy construction and renovations in the capital. As the garbage piled up, it began threatening the nearby homes, prompting residents to stage regular protests while complaining of health hazards.
‚ÄúThese people did not choose to live next to a dump. But they brought the garbage in and made this place horrible,‚Äù said rickshaw driver Dilip Mirmal, 34, whose home was spared while those surrounding were completely subsumed. He counted 23 of his neighbours among the dead.
‚ÄúThis is a government-made disaster,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI have a mix of feelings ‚Äî of anger, frustration and sorrow. We have been trying to protest and raise these issues, but no one was listening.‚Äù
In any other year, Dodger fans would wake up today in a blue-faced fury.
The baseball winter meetings are underway, and already their team has struck out!
The Dodgers swung and missed with Shohei Ohtani. They whiffed on Giancarlo Stanton. They kept the bat on their shoulder for reliever Brandon Morrow.
That's three Cody Bellinger-sized strikes, enough for fans in any other year to scream at Andrew Friedman and Farhan Zaidi to get moving and try to win now.
But this December is different. Friedman and Zaidi are coming off a season in which they moved mountains in building a team with the best record in baseball. Not only did they try to win now, but they also came within nine innings of winning now, right now, on the first day of November to be exact.
So a couple of thoughts are bouncing around locally as Dodgers administrators hang out across the country disguised as disinterested ducklings at Disney's Swan and Dolphin Resort in Orlando.
First, let's be honest, it's really hard for fans to get worked up over next season when they haven't recovered from last season. Is that how you're feeling? That's how virtually all Dodgers fan I know is feeling. The cold shower that was Game 7 of the World Series against that Houston Astros has pretty much leaked all over this year's hot stove.
The usual questions about who they are acquiring for 2018 have been drowned out by the continual questions surrounding how they blew it in 2017.
During a recent breakfast with an old friend, we spent most of the meal discussing whether the Dodgers should have started Clayton Kershaw instead of Yu Darvish in Game 7. I still say no. My friend insists yes. It was a lively October debate still raging in December.
At a recent holiday party it happened again. I asked a friend to name his biggest World Series turning point, and the smart guy cited Ross Stripling's four-pitch walk to Marwin Gonzalez to lead off the seventh inning in Game 3 and send the bullpen spiraling into an 11-inning defeat. I, instead, cited Kenley Jansen's gopher ball to Gonzalez in the ninth inning of that game. We spent a few minutes of a winter night arguing like it was summer, which was completely crazy, yet made total sense.
So, yeah, most of us aren't really over it yet, OK?
Once the hangover ends, the realization will surely hit that these Dodgers don't really need much, and what they do need they won't really need for several months.
They need another starting pitcher, but they have time to find one. Friedman and Zaidi proved last year that they can do that even if it takes until the final seconds of the trade deadline. That deal was for the ill-fated Darvish, but still ...
They also need bullpen help, but every spring these guys seem to create middle relievers out of the swirling Camelback dust.
They could use another power bat, but at this point would they trade prospects to get one after relying so much on some of those prospects in last season's playoff run?
Friedman and Zaidi are smart enough to know that they can't get back to a World Series Game 7 with the same cast of characters ‚Äî even minus Darvish ‚Äî but they're also smart enough not to break up a league champion.
On Monday in Orlando, Friedman made sense when he told reporters, ‚ÄúOur thought process is we're really happy with the talent base that we have right now. ‚Ä¶ We're not going to try to force anything.''
Did they need Shohei Otani, who signed with the Angels? Sure, but this winter's most compelling free agent wants to both pitch and hit, which makes him a much better fit in the American League, where Mike Scioscia will have a much easier time keeping him happy.
Could they have used Giancarlo Stanton, who the Miami Marlins handed to the New York Yankees? Absolutely. But for the sort of budgetary restraints his enormously expensive presence would have put on the rest of the roster, they can live without him. They weren't 59 home runs from a championship last year. They were nine innings.
Should they have tried harder to keep Brandon Morrow, their tremendous middle reliever who is probably headed off to be a closer for the Chicago Cubs? Nah. He's 33, has had arm issues, they've seen him at probably his best ‚Ä¶ they should be thankful with his miracle comeback year and let him try to extend himself elsewhere.
The Dodgers reinforced the core of this team last winter with the big-money signings of Jansen, Justin Turner and Rich Hill. They've held tight to kids who have become stars such as Bellinger and Corey Seager. They've made smart trades that turned up diamonds such as Chris Taylor, Austin Barnes, Enrique Hernandez and Alex Wood.
‚ÄúWe consciously did a lot of our heavy lifting last winter, recognizing that we were locking a core in place for the forseeable future,'' Friedman told reporters. ‚ÄúAnd we were happy about it then. And we're happy now.''
They should be. The worst that could happen is if they suddenly try to be too smart and mess with a magic that extended from the field to the clubhouse to the final game of the season, which was lost by a celebrated starting pitcher who wasn't big enough for the moment, a pitcher who will never wear a Dodgers uniform again.
Friedman and Zaidi have work to do, but not a lot of work, and not enough to cause anyone to go crazy just yet ... at least not until last season is finally washed away with the start of spring training. At that point, the media's first question to manager Dave Roberts will be about why he didn't pull Darvish sooner.

Canadian writer and actor William (Bill) Whitehead has died. HarperCollins Publishers says he died Thursday in Toronto after recently being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. He was 86. Whitehead was known for his work at the CBC, where he wrote many seasons of The Nature of Things, for which he won several awards. He was also the longtime partner of the late Canadian author Timothy Findley, with whom he collaborated on many radio and TV scripts, including the miniseries The National Dream: Building the Impossible Railway.
Article Continued Below
The two were together for over 40 years and met when the Regina-raised Whitehead was acting at the Red Barn Theatre in Jackson's Point, north of Toronto. When Findley died, Whitehead edited a collection of his work Journeyman: Travels with a Writer, published in 2003. ‚ÄúBill was the person who made (Findley's) life and art possible, creating the space that allowed (him) to write the works of fiction that made him one of the most beloved authors in the country,‚Äù Iris Tupholme, senior vice-president and executive publisher of HarperCollins Publishers Ltd., said in a statement.
If there are two aspects that Tiger Shroff is known for, it is his martial arts moves and dancing abilities. We have seem them in his films, music videos and have marvelled at them (or sometimes, laughed out loud at the memes they inspired).
Now, Hindustan Times reports that Shroff is planning to open a martial arts and dance school in Mumbai. The idea behind this initiative is to make the current generation physically active rather than just fiddling with their smart phones all the time.
The report quotes him as saying, "I've been getting a lot of requests from fans and families asking from where I've learnt martial arts. This made me think, why not open a school for them?"
Mumbai Mirror reports that Shroff has joined hands with entrepreneur-turned-film producer Imtiaz Khatri to set up a chain of 12 martial arts schools across the country within the next two years. They have jointly purchased a 3,000 sq feet plot in Bandra, close to Shroff's residence, where they will construct a martial arts school that is likely to go operational in three months.
The report quotes Shroff as saying, "I am and will always be a student of mixed martial arts which is the fastest growing sport globally. Since my first movie, Heropanti, I've wanted to give something back to young people who have showered me with so much love and there's no better way to do that than give them a safe place to learn this amazing sport and channelise their energy in a disciplined way."
It is doubtful whether Shroff will be able to take time out from his hectic shooting schedule to train the students personally ‚Äî perhaps the task will be outsourced to handpicked instructors. Nonetheless, it is a noteworthy initiative by the actor.
The National Reined Cow Horse Association (NRCHA) Snaffle A bit Futurity Open rein work preliminaries wrapped up Thursday, Oct. 5, at the Will Rogers Equestrian Center in Fort Worth, Texas.
The high score in the Open and Intermediate Open, a 223.5, belonged to Metallic Rays (Metallic Cat x Margaret Rey x Dual Rey), a stallion shown by NRCHA Professional Ricky Nicolazzi, of Scottsdale, Arizona. Metallic Rays is owned by Sarah Davis.
High scorers in the three Futurity preliminary events ‚Äì rein work, herd work and cow work ‚Äì always receive paychecks and awards for their top performances. In 2017, the go-round money for the Futurity Open is more than double the 2016 payout, thanks to increased purses resulting from the Futurity's move to Texas this year. Nicolazzi collected approximately $5,000 for the high score in the open, and another $2,000 for winning the Intermediate Open rein work go-round.
The NRCHA Snaffle A bit Futurity Open preliminary action resumes Friday, Oct. 6, with the second of the three reined cow horse events, the herd work, in the historic Will Rogers Coliseum. Friday's schedule also includes the first of the horse show classes for horses older than three, with the Non Pro Limited in the John Justin Arena.

The municipality of Emerson-Franklin wants to have some input on how crown land near the Emerson port of entry will be developed in the future.
The province plans to re-design and re-align the northbound and southbound lanes of PTH 75 leading in and out of the Pembina-Emerson Ports of Entry. The highway re-design will accommodate the expansion of both the Canadian and American ports of entry that are planned.
Tracy French, CAO for the municipality says those alterations will result in the creation of surplus crown lands that would have significant commercial value along the busy highway.
"The municipality would like to look at private investment into the area and think that there might be an opportunity for some of the surplus lands to be used for that purpose."
French says the municipality would like to collaborate with the various provincial government departments and private interests to come up with a development plan for those surplus crown lands.
"Council feels it's important a feasibility study be conducted with respect to the impact of PTH 75, to be able to identify some of the servicing capacity requirements for the area and potential for land development," said French.
The municipality is working on a proposal outlining a collaborative planning process that they hope to submit to the provincial government later this month.
There is a sense of urgency in completing a feasibility study before work is finished on the expansion of the border facilities. According to French, the surplus lands, if developed properly, could be a real economic driver for their municipality.
"It definitely could, and for a municipality our size a project like this could have considerable positive impacts on the economic development of the area."
: India's exports to China, which have been showing signs of revival this year after years of slump, registered a 40.69 percent rise year-on-year to reach USD 10.60 billion in the first seven months of 2017.Fired by exports of zinc, iron ore and steel, total Indian exports to China registered a 38.6 percent increase year-on-year in August this year totalling to USD 1.26 billion, the sharpest increase this year.However, the trade deficit expanded to USD 44.51 billion in the first seven months despite surge in Indian exports as imports from China continue to increase.The India-China bilateral trade increased 18.34 percent year-on-year to reach USD 55.11 billion from January to August this year, according to official data accessed by PTI in Beijing. India's exports to China increased by 40.69 percent year-on-year to reach USD 10.60 billion during the seven months.India's imports from China saw a year-on-year growth of 14.02 percent to reach USD 44.50 billion.The cause for surge of Indian exports to China was a result of exponential increase of 353.99 percent of exports of zinc and related items, 248.19 percent of iron and steel and 100.7 percent increase in ores and slag and 151.17 percent rise in copper.India was the second largest exporter of diamonds to China totalling to USD 1.63 billion with a market share of 32.97 percent after South Africa.India was the second largest exporter of salt, sulphur, earths and stone, plastering materials, lime, and cement to China totalling to USD 692 million with 17.39 percent market share after Turkey.India's cotton exports, including yarn and woven fabric, to China showed a growth of 6.77 per cent to reach USD 844 million.The country was the third largest exporter of cotton to China after Vietnam and the US accounting for 15.05 percent share in the Chinese market.India-China bilateral trade increased by 14.93 percent year-on-year in August to reach USD 7.51 billion.Despite the increase in Indian exports to China, Indian business and trade circles associated with bilateral trade however advise caution as it is mostly led by iron ore and steel exports which started declining in 2013 due to a domestic crackdown on mines as well as China scaling down its steel production due to the global economic crisis.The trade deficit began expanding ever since iron ore exports, the mainstay of Indian exports started declining. Last year, the trade deficit climbed to USD 52 billion.India has been pressing China to open up its pharmaceutical and IT software sectors to expand the base of Indian exports.So far, there has been no major breakthrough in both areas, despite promises by China.
For Salam, a resident in the Islamic State-held Old City of Mosul, the holy fasting month of Ramadan this year is the worst he's seen in a lifetime marked by wars and deprivations.
"We are slowly dying from hunger, boiling mouldy wheat as soup" to break the fast at sunset, the 47 year-old father of three said by phone from the district besieged by Iraqi forces, asking to withhold his name fearing the militants' retribution.
The only wish he makes in his prayers is for his family to survive the final days of the self-proclaimed caliphate declared three years ago by IS's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi from a nearby mosque.
The eight-month old U.S.-backed campaign to capture Mosul, IS's de-facto capital in Iraq, reached its deadliest phase just as the holy Muslim month started at the end of May, when militants became squeezed in and around the densely populated Old City.
Up to 200,000 people are trapped behind their lines, half of them children, according to the United Nations.
Hundreds have been killed while trying to escape to government-held lines, caught in the cross-fire or gunned down by Islamic State snipers. The militants want civilians to remain in areas under their control to use them as human shields.
Many bodies of the dead remain in the street near the frontlines. Four of them are relatives of Khalil, a former civil servant who quit his job after IS took over Mosul.
"Daesh warned us not to bury them to make them an example for others who try to flee," he said, using an acronym for Islamic State.
Those who decide not to run the risk of fleeing are living in fear of getting killed or wounded in their homes, with little food and water and limited access to healthcare.
"Seeing my kids hungry is real torture," said Salam, who closed his home appliances shop shortly after the start of the offensive as sales came to a complete stop."I wish the security forces would eliminate all Daesh fighters in a flash; I want my family to have normal life again."
Where food can be found, the price has risen more than 20-fold. A kilo of rice is selling for more than $40. A kilo of flour or lentils is $20 or more.
The sellers are mainly households who stockpiled enough food and medicine to dare sell some, but only to trusted neighbors or relatives, or in return for items they need. If militants find food they take it.
Residents fill water from a few wells dug in the soil. The wait is long and dangerous as shelling is frequent.
‚ÄúThe well-water has a bitter taste and we can smell sewage sometimes, but we have to drink to stay alive,‚Äù said Umm Saad, a widow and mother of four, complaining that the militants are often seen with bottled water and canned food.
‚ÄúWe have been under compulsory fasting even before the start of Ramadan," she said. "No real food to eat, just hardened old bread and mouldy grains."
About 800,000 people, more than a third of the pre-war city's population, have already fled, seeking refuge either with friends and relatives or in camps. But in areas still held by the militants escape has become harder than ever.
"Fleeing is like committing suicide," said Khalil, the ex-civil servant, who lives near the medieval Grand al-Nuri Mosque, the offensive's symbolic focus, where Baghdadi proclaimed himself caliph.
IS's black flag has been flying over its landmark leaning minaret since June 2014, when the Iraqi army fled in the face of the militants, giving them their biggest prize, a city at least four times bigger than any other they came to control in both Iraq and neighboring Syria.
Justin Turner tied a team postseason record with five RBIs and Yasiel Puig had two hits, including a triple, and two RBIs as the Dodgers won Game 1 of the best-of-five series.
Game 2 is Saturday at 6 p.m. PT at Dodger Stadium. Robbie Ray will be on the mound for Arizona and Rich Hill for the Dodgers.

LUNCH on the third day. This session definitely belonged to the Indians as Virat Kohli and boys picked 3 wickets and now need 6 more wickets to seal the game and the series along with it. Mathews and skipper Chandimal have been solid in the last hour, but it will be highly unlikely that the duo can stall play for the next two sessions. Should end by today evening. Sri Lanka's score reads 82/4
Given the setup, picking an expansion draft protected list of just 11 players was always going to be a bit of a challenge.
Sure, homegrown players ‚Äî like Alphonso Davies and Russell Teibert ‚Äî and new signings ‚Äî hi, Anthony Blondell ‚Äî were going to be exempt.
And yes, LAFC only gets to pick five players total from all of Major League Soccer in Tuesday's draft. And, yes, if you do lose a player, you can't lose any more.
And, yes, with a slew of players out of contract, the decisions in the end were few.
But it's still a bit of a surprise to see Marcel de Jong, Bernie Ibini, Cristian Techera and Brek Shea all left exposed.
Whitecaps head coach Carl Robinson could only protect 11 players.
Most of those 11 are no-brainers, like new addition Kei Kamara. Others in this ‚Äòof course' category are Aly Ghazal, Stefan Marinovic, Jake Nerwinski, Tim Parker, Tony Tchani and Kendall Waston.
It's really not that surprising that Nico Mezquida, solid, loyal soldier that he is, has also been protected by Robinson. Same goes for Erik Hurtado.
But then you get to the last two spots, and you might really be raising your eyebrows. First, were Yordy Reyna not currently in a world of legal trouble, it would be no shock to see him protected. The guy was a shining star for the Whitecaps in 2017. But his connections to the death of a teenage girl in Peru ‚Äî he rented the apartment where she suffered a fatal injury, that much we know for sure ‚Äî aren't good and make you wonder how the Whitecaps feel about him now.
And then there's Fredy Montero, who is almost certain not to play again for Tianjin TEDA, the Chinese club he joined in 2016 but who then loaned him to the Whitecaps for 2017 because they had run out of foreign player spots on their roster. The Whitecaps have protected him too, though they don't currently have a deal for him to play in MLS in 2018.
That's two spots that perhaps might have been used on a depth winger like Ibini, a potential starting left back like de Jong, or a pair of top quality wingers in Brek Shea and Cristian Techera.
Techera sure looks like the most appealing player on the Whitecaps' list, given his playing credentials and his status as a non-designated player. But he also would cost an international spot and perhaps LA would see his salary ‚Äî his cap hit is $377,000 ‚Äî as being a sticking point.
Shea is an intriguing option as well. He's a designated player, but he's exactly the kind of player targeted allocation money is designed for. His salary could be bought down to below the designated player threshold, allowing a team use the spot on another top-end player.
There are a handful of players who don't have contracts for 2018 but who would surely interest: Christian Bolanos, Nosa Igiebor, Matias Laba, David Ousted and Sheanon Williams. All remain top-quality players.
Bolanos has said in Costa Rican media that he would love to be back, but even though he's 33, still has thoughts of Europe. Given his playing style Caps would clearly like to bring back Igiebor, but haven't been able to reach a deal yet. Do LA see the same ability? Laba will miss half the year, so would LA risk a DP spot on him? David Ousted was after a raise on his 2017 salary, but he's a proven performer and LA might want a guy like him protecting the goal. And then there's Sheanon Williams, who was suspended in May after a domestic incident ‚Äî the crown eventually stayed charges against him ‚Äî barely played thereafter and when he did he fared poorly.
Of course, there are 20 other teams for LA to consider, though many lists don't present the kind of options the Whitecaps' does.
At least this won't take long on Tuesday.
Available Whitecaps for LAFC expansion draft
Under contract: Marcel de Jong, Bernie Ibini, Brek Shea, Cristian Techera
Needs a new contract: Christian Bolanos, David Edgar, Kyle Greig, Nosa Igiebor, Matias Laba, Brett Levis, Aaron Maund, David Ousted, Mauro Rosales, Cole Seiler, Sheanon Williams

Loaned out for 2018: Spencer Richey, Deybi Flores
Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of protecting mining baron G Janardhana Reddy-led "Ballari gang" and BJP's chief ministerial candidate BS Yeddyurappa, Congress on Tuesday alleged that the CBI closed all cases of illegal mining against them "outlandishly."CBI shutdown cases against Yeddyurappa, Reddy and his "gang" in connection with the plundering of Rs 35,000 crore worth iron ore in six out of nine ports in four states of Karnataka, Goa, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala alleged.This happened within 165 days of BJP national president Amit Shah announcing Yeddyurappa as their chief ministerial face in Karnataka elections, Surjewala told reporters here."The truth is, according to Modi government, no one stole iron ore of Rs 35,000 crore. Modi government has actually come to the rescue of, what all Kannadigas call, the Ballari gang," he said."Karnataka has been betrayed by BJP and its puppet CBI to protect the mining barons," Surjewala said.He said the Siddaramaiah government handed over the matter to the CBI on November 18, 2013 pertaining to sale and export of iron ore in four states in nine ports. Accoding to him, these ports are Karwar and New Mangalore Port Trust in"Karnataka, Panaji and Mormugao in Goa, Ennore and Chennai in Tamil Nadu and Krishna Patnam, Vishakhapatnam and Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh.All these nine ports were used to siphon off Karnataka's iron ore, Surjewala added. "On May 27, 2017 as the CBI was examining these cases, BJP national president Amit Shah declares Yeddyurappa as their chief ministerial face in the ensuing Karnataka election. Within days thereafter, on June 13, 2017, CBI writes to Karnataka government saying that there is no criminal case, no iron ore was stolen from the two ports in Goa," he added.According to Surjewala, CBI closed down cases in Goa ports because the ores of Karnataka and Goa got mixed together. It shut down the criminal cases of iron ore smuggling and stealing for both the ports in Karnataka also without assigning any reason, he alleged.The cases at two ports of Tamil Nadu were closed because the CBI did not receive the notification from the government and thus it was shut, he said."No wonder that Narendra Modi and Amit Shah have gone out of the way to give eight assembly tickets to Reddy brothers and associates, whether it is Gali Karunakara Reddy, Somashekhara Reddy, we all know B Sriramulu, Lallesh Reddy, Suresh Babu, Sanna Fakirappa and Sai Kumar," Surjewala said.Defending Congress for giving ticket to some mining barons, Surjewala said investigations into these cases were still progressing.
A former Newtown resident who operated a law practice in Bridgeport pleaded guilty Wednesday, May 30, to stealing more than $1 million.
Thomas Murtha, 62, now of Birmingham, Mich., entered a guilty plea to one count of wire fraud at federal court in Hartford.
John H. Durham, United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, said Murtha operated a law practice under the name Maher & Murtha LLC in Bridgeport. Beginning in approximately November 2011, Murtha stole at least $1.3 million from more than 20 individuals, including law clients, friends and family members. More than $516,000 of the stolen funds were for the benefit of an individual with mental health issues. As part of the scheme, Murtha submitted false or forged documents to victims, according to Durham. Murtha also incurred charges on credit cards in the names of others without their knowledge or permission.
The investigation revealed that Murtha used some of the stolen funds in connection with the purchase of a $725,000 house in Michigan.
In September 2016, Murtha resigned from the bar after three grievance complaints were filed against him. He was arrested on a federal criminal complaint on April 5, 2017, and a grand jury returned a multi-count indictment against him on Aug. 16, 2017.
Murtha is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Michael P. Shea on Sept. 11. He faces a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years.
Murtha has agreed to pay total restitution of at least $1,364,119.15, and to forfeit his interests in the house in Michigan and a 2.11-carat diamond engagement ring that the government has seized.
Murtha is free on a $10,000 bond pending sentencing.
This matter is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Greenwich Police Department, with the assistance of the Connecticut Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jennifer R. Laraia and David T. Huang.

Elon Musk has big dreams for Puerto Rico. On Thursday, the Tesla Inc. chief executive said he would discuss building a high-tech solar grid for the island with Ricardo Rossello, Puerto Rico's governor.
"Let's talk," Rossello tweeted at Musk.
"I would be happy to talk," Musk replied. "Hopefully, Tesla can be helpful."
Although Musk's idea doesn't solve Puerto Rico's current crisis ‚Äî 90% of the island is still without power, and many are having trouble getting clean water ‚Äî it could set the island on the path to sustainable, renewable energy, which could reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels and ultimately bolster its economy. The proposal, in other words, makes a great deal of sense, even if it doesn't help right away.
Puerto Rico's electric company already was in shambles. In July, it basically filed for bankruptcy, saying it owed $9 billion and needed an additional $4 billion to revamp its power plants, whose median age is 40 years old.
That was before Hurricane Maria struck. Now, in light of the damage to Puerto Rico's electric grid, people such as Musk are seeing the crisis as a chance for the island to move away from centralized, vulnerable electricity systems.
"The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt, PUC, any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of PR," Musk posted Thursday on Twitter.
Among the "many smaller islands" to which Musk is referring is the island of Ta'u in American Samoa. Last year, Tesla said it had wired Ta'u with thousands of solar panels and batteries that would meet nearly all of the energy needs of its 600 residents. It was an example of how, under the right conditions, an island population could shift almost entirely away from fossil fuels.
According to Musk, there's no reason something similar couldn't be achieved in Puerto Rico.
Musk isn't exactly going out on a limb here. Scientists and energy experts say that a distributed grid that doesn't rely on a single power plant for energy generation could help vulnerable island regions such as the Caribbean weather strong storms like Irma or Maria.
Solar panels, which can feed their power into batteries and be linked together into local or regional power grids, are one example of a technology that could spread the potential risk out across a population. And at tropical latitudes, you get the most bang for your solar buck: Photovoltaic panels located there are even more effective at energy generation than they are at higher latitudes.
The long-term economic benefits could be equally transformative. Island residents face some of the highest energy prices in the world because the vast majority of their fuel must be imported. Reducing those fuel costs by switching to wind or solar could permanently set these island economies on a more positive trajectory.
"When we are facing the sort of infrastructure destruction we have seen this hurricane season, it only makes sense to give some pause before reinvesting in the exact same system that proved too vulnerable," Gwen Holdmann, who directs the Alaska Center for Energy and Power at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, said in an email.
"If [Puerto Rico's] system were redesigned around microgrids incorporating local power production," Holdmann said, "there would still be losses, but the number and duration of outages due to severe weather events would decrease."
So it's really no surprise to see solar advocates such as Musk reaching out to Puerto Rico.

"Ferguson is wanted in connection with a series of serious offences and we will arrest him for those offences. Any further delays caused by other individuals assisting him will not be tolerated.
‚ÄúMy message to anyone helping him is, is this worth your own liberty? Are you really prepared to be arrested in order to help him?
‚ÄúI want to reassure the decent law-abiding citizens, who are the majority of the community, that we will be relentless in the pursuit of anyone evading justice and their accomplices.
"We have officers out in the area continually to ensure you can feel safe in your own community.‚Äù

It's been two and a half years since we last saw former WWE World Heavyweight Champion Batista in a WWE ring, and it doesn't look like we'll see him return anytime soon. According to a new report from Cageside Seats, The Animal is ‚Äúdone with WWE,‚Äù and he isn't planning to return to the company for a retirement match. Of course, after he left WWE in the spring of 2014, the ex-pro wrestler turned movie star said that he would love to come back and have a retirement match against his mentor, Triple H. But, it looks like he's changed his mind. Batista was offered a special guest referee spot in the main event of last year's WrestleMania 32, which ended up being Triple H vs. Roman Reigns, but he turned it down. At the time, he was furious with the company because of how they handled the Titus O'Neil situation. He also advised Titus to quit the company, but, the former Tag Team Champion didn't take The Animal's advice. [Image by WWE] During a recent interview with Chris Van Vliet, Batista said that he would actually be interested in coming back if he could just work the non-televised live events, because those shows are much easier to do than WWE's weekly television shows. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, I love WWE, and I've proven that I wouldn't wrestle anywhere else. I feel like wrestling anywhere else is a step down. I love the company, and I'll always be appreciative for what they've done for me, and I would love to go back, it's just that they're really hard to deal with, and right now, my passion is acting. But if they would allow me to go back and just do house shows, I'd be all over it, because then you just skip over all the red tape ‚Äî you don't have to deal with any of the writers, or any of that bulls**t.‚Äù Batista did express frustration with how his return was handled by WWE back in 2014 during his appearance on Chris Jericho's podcast ‚Äî Talk is Jericho. He said that he wanted to come back as a heel, but the company thought he should come back as a babyface, which he knew would flop. Long story short, it did, and WWE had to change their plans because of the audience's poor reaction to his return. Batista's departure from WWE in mid-2014 led to him being replaced in The Authority, which at the time was just the Evolution trio which featured himself, Randy Orton, and Triple H, by Seth Rollins, who turned on The Shield on the very same night that Batista left. [Image by WWE] Originally, Batista was supposed to come back and have a couple more matches, but his transition to Hollywood was going so well, and he didn't want to stop the momentum that he had built in his new career. Batista, who will turn 48 in a couple of weeks, is still in great shape, and he probably will be for a very long time. So, the door will always be open for him to return to the ring. Will he return anytime soon? Probably not. But, it's hard to believe that he'll never return to the ring. The Animal is also a great candidate for the WWE Hall of Fame, as he was one of the company's biggest stars in the mid and late-2000s, and whenever he does get inducted, he'll likely be inducted by Triple H. There's also a chance that the entire Evolution faction [Triple H, Ric Flair, and Randy Orton] will induct him whenever he goes in. [Featured Image by WWE]

A possible solution to curbing road accidents caused by black ice is making its debut in Chilliwack, and it could be a sign of the future.
Developed in New Zealand, the ‚ÄúPATeye‚Äù is now embedded in 10 different stretches of road in the city, buried deep enough so it doesn't get dug up by snow plow blades.
The small stud is packed with sensory technology that measures temperature and moisture, and lights up with blue flashes when ice forms on the road.
The in ground Pateye has landed. Get to work safely ‚Äì plough right over these babies! #icedetection #roadsafety pic.twitter.com/qk465GWYRs ‚Äî Solar Bright (@SolarBrightNZ) October 26, 2014
City officials say the combination of freezing temperatures and the position of the sun can allow ice to form extremely quickly, often before more traditional warnings can be issued or addressed.
‚ÄúEspecially in the fall, the winter and spring, road conditions can change throughout our community,‚Äù the city's public safety specialist Samantha Piper said.
READ MORE: Here we snow again? Winter weather forecast for Metro Vancouver Thursday
‚ÄúYou can have your windows down on one side of Chilliwack and drive to another side, and the temperatures drops several degrees.‚Äù
The device, which is powered by solar energy, casts a light bright enough that it can even be picked up on traffic cameras, giving road crews an early warning of where trouble spots might be.
Craig Young with ATS Traffic, which sells these and other road safety devices to cities throughout western Canada, says the PATeye can do much more than just detect ice.
READ MORE: 63% of B.C. drivers set to repeat last year's winter-driving mistakes
‚ÄúTraffic counts, vehicle classifications, seismic [activity], snow depth sensors ‚Äî those are actually being tested right now,‚Äù Young said.
The 10 devices are part of a pilot program that the city hopes to expand if it proves to be effective, but officials are confident that it will become a useful tool in their efforts to move to a networked road system.
Matias Laba's name may bubble up fairly often in the coming weeks ‚Äî or has the transfer boil has already started?
Laba's contract is up at the end of the season.
Monday morning, a report out of Argentina is suggested famed club Racing is after the defensive midfielder services, even despite concerns over a knee injury suffered this weekend against New England. (The Whitecaps say he's slated for an MRI this week.)
#Racing ofert√≥ formalmente por Mat√≠as Laba. El jugador de Vancuover (hoy se hace estudios por una lesi√≥n que ser√≠a leve) ve con agredo venir pic.twitter.com/ik3FrLour5 ‚Äî C√©sar Luis Merlo (@CLMerlo) August 14, 2017
According to Argentine soccer reporter C√©sar Luis Merlo, Racing are serious and have made a formal offer. The Whitecaps, as you'd expect, aren't commenting.
Laba is one of three designated players for the Whitecaps. He was added from Toronto FC in a 2014 loan deal; his move was made permanent in 2015. TFC paid just over $1.5 million (U.S.) in 2013 to Argentinos Juniors. He spent one season in Toronto, but the Reds were forced to move him west after signing Jermaine Defoe, Michael Bradley and Gilberto as designated players before the 2014 season.
And while the Whitecaps may be keeping mum on Racing's offer it is notable the team signed Aly Ghazal last week. By reputation, the Egyptian is a very similar player to Laba: a player whose primary strength is removing the ball from the opposition, who's perfectly happy to play in the defensive half of the park.
Caps manager Carl Robinson has openly said he likes having two potential starters at every position to drive internal competition, but he'd also admit it's important to have cover at all those positions because you never know what will come along, be they injuries or clubs swooping in with offers, what have you.
That a good player like Laba would be coveted by other clubs should be no surprise.
Racing finished fourth in the 2016017 Primera Division season. The current Argentine transfer window closes on Sept. 17; if no club pays for his contract before then, they could add him as a free agent when his contract with the Whitecaps expires at the end of 2017.
Assuming, of course, the Whitecaps don't try to extend his contact. Laba is making $885,000 (U.S.) this season.

Google has been talking about ARCore on Android for a while now. Apple's been championing ARKit for iPhone for about as long. Today, the first cross-platform ARKit/ARCore app has launched on both app stores respectively. It's called Just a Line and you and your friends can make drawings in the air, and even draw on top of each other's art, using augmented reality.
Free - Download now
It's just a simple app. One person draws in the air using their phone. Another person draws in the air using their phone. Both air drawings show up on both phones, in real time. You can also record video of your AR doodles to share on your sosh meeds.
It uses Google's Cloud Anchor system, which allows one person to "host" and AR session that others can join. The information is sent to Google's cloud servers and directed back to each device, which makes it possible to play games and share experiences on Android and iOS devices.
This is just the first of what's sure to be a lot of cross-platform apps and games that will make use of both ARKit and ARCore.
I can't wait to play a rematch of that battle game I played with Russell Holly. You won't beat me next time!

As complaints rack up against floor company, former employee says he hasn't been paid
A former employee with Bonita Springs Floor Covering contacted WINK News after seeing our story about customers complaining.
More: Remodeling nightmare for some customers of Bonita Springs Flooring Company
‚ÄúThe guy is a crook. Really, he's just a crook,‚Äù said the former employee who asked to remain anonymous. He also claims every time he asked the company President, Chris Pascale, for his paycheck, all he got was excuses.
‚ÄúHe was saying, ‚Äòoh I'm with a client right now, I'm with a client,' and then he said, ‚Äòoh well I'll wire transfer it to you.' Nothing. And he just kept putting it off and putting it off.‚Äù
Customers tell us those responses are similar to what Pascale told them.
‚ÄúI called and emailed for probably over two weeks, didn't hear anything,‚Äù said Maryann Galluccio of her experience hiring Bonita Springs Floor Covering.
‚ÄúAnd it just kept going on and on and on,‚Äù said Maurice Bielicki of the excuses he received from Pascale.
This former employee says he felt bad for the customers, some who were out a lot more money than himself.
‚ÄúI would always be constantly apologizing and that's one of the reasons why I stayed with him as long as I could because I felt bad for the customers.‚Äù
Three people have filed lawsuits against the company and there are more than 20 complaints against them between the Better Business Bureau, the Department of Business and Professional Regulation and our WINK News Call for Action office.
We tried to reach the president of Bonita Springs Floor Covering, Chris Pascale, a number of times, but have yet to have an actual conversation with him.
We checked on Thursday, February 1, and the door of his business was locked and a note said they were short office staff due to the flu.

Last year, the Boston hardcore band Firewalker released an absolutely ferocious self-titled debut album. And now they've got another absolute rager of a new song called ‚ÄúRole Model.‚Äù It's a short track, less than two minutes, and much of that runtime is given over to audio footage of some other, unidentified hardcore singer fuming about girls in the hardcore scene. The rest of the song is a fiery riposte to that sort of bullshit, with frontwoman Sophie Hendry fuming, in her death-metal growl, about ‚Äúa roomful of assholes.‚Äù It's a strident, inspiring song, and you can hear it below.
Fresh! Volume 1 Track by Firewalker
‚ÄúRole Model‚Äù appears on the new Teeny Tiny Records compilation Fresh! Volume 1, which also features bands like Krimewatch and Luxe. You can get that here.
‚ÄúI think the creative drive is a very powerful thing if you have it. Part of it's just a measure of your own growth, your own spiritual growth, your intellectual growth. Part of it is just ego. You're like an athlete or anybody who wants to accomplish something in life, you don't want to be told, ‚ÄúWell, it's time to hang up your gloves and just enjoy life.‚Äù We're all driven to keep on going.‚Äù ‚ÄìJohn Adams
At age 70, composer John Adams shows no signs of slowing down. Early next month, he's conducting performances of his seminal 1987 opera Nixon in China at the LA Philharmonic in Walt Disney Concert Hall. He's currently finishing his most recent opera, The Girls of the Golden West, which will be premiered at San Francisco Opera in November. As topical as ever, Adams says that opera will approach race relations, women's rights, and ‚Äòfake news.'
Adams is consistently (this year included) the most frequently performed living composer by American orchestras. On this, his 70th birthday, here are some of the KUSC staff's picks of Adams' essential work.
Harmonielehre (Brian): This 40-minute work for large orchestra is what got me hooked, not just on Adams' music, but on contemporary music in general. I went to a performance of it by the Atlanta Symphony because there was something else on the program that I wanted to hear and I thought, well, I'll just give this Adams thing a chance. Little did I know that I would be literally blown away by the music. (Be sure to listen to the last couple of minutes of the piece, which are just spectacular!)
Harmonium (Alan): Similar title, but a different piece. In this work, Adams sets poetry by John Donne and Emily Dickinson. I found it exciting on first hearing and it continues to be a favorite.
Grand Pianola Music (Gail): An open-hearted, glorious calling card proclaiming independence from the serialism and hyper-seriousness of the mid-to-late 20th century in concert music
Scheherazade.2 (Brian): A feminist update to the story, famously set to music by Rimsky-Korsakov, of Scheherazade that focuses on the strength and resiliency of the woman, rather than her cleverness and ability to keep entertaining her warped, murderous husband.
Slonimsky's Earbox (Alan): A colorful tribute to a colorful and witty musical personality, Nicolas Slonimsky.
‚ÄúBatter My Heart‚Äù from Doctor Atomic (Gail): Set to the poetry of John Donne and maybe our greatest 21st century opera aria so far.
John's Book of Alleged Dances (Brian): Composed in 1994 for the Kronos Quartet, this set of 10 short dances is a total blast. Adams says they are ‚Äúalleged‚Äù because ‚Äúthe steps for them had yet to be invented.‚Äù My favorites are ‚ÄúPavane: She's So Fine,‚Äù ‚ÄúRag the Bone,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlligator Escalator.‚Äù
On the Transmigration of Souls (Alan): A chilling piece in memory of 9/11 that includes the recitation of the names of victims and texts from signs that were posted around Ground Zero.
The Gospel According to the Other Mary (Gail): I was lucky enough to hear it live twice, in L.A. and Paris. Its poignancy and uncanny vocal, choral and orchestral textures are unforgettable.

It seems that worries are not leaving Rao Anwar. Muhammad Khan, the father of the slain Naqeeb Mehsud, is determined to tighten the noose of justice system around the neck of Rao Anwar. He is keen on probing the luxurious lifestyle of Rao who is accused of holding a fake encounter resulting in the killing of Khan's son. The move suggests that Muhammad Khan does not want to leave any aspect of the case uncovered. Whether a probe into Rao's means of income will affect the proceedings of the already pending case in any way or not? One cannot say anything with absolute surety in a country like Pakistan where every law and procedure is tweaked to protect prisoners and defendants with influence.
The complainant maintains that given his pecuniary resources are not in proportion to Rao's known sources of income, he must have made his fortunes through means that are not legally accepted. Lifestyle not proportionate with one's income constitutes an offence under section 9(v) of NAB Ordinance 1999. The anti-graft body should act swiftly if the allegations of Mr Khan hold any weight. It is about time for the anti-graft body to look into the matter. The suspended official is at his weakest position these days. It is a perfect opportunity for the anti-graft body to find out the sources of income that allow Rao Anwar a lavish lifestyle.
Despite the fact that the case in hands has gained so much coverage, it is ironic that the matter is subjected to delaying tactics by the accused as well as the officials. Only recently, investigation officer (IO) failed to appear before the court. The absence of IO shows the seriousness of the officials in settling the case in hands. Mr Khan along with social activist, Jibran Nasir, criticised the slow pace and performance of prosecution in Naqeeb's case.
Whereas Jibran Nasir called such moves as shameful delaying tactics, these moves speak volumes about the inefficacy of Pakistan's criminal justice system. People have already lost faith in the criminal justice system of the country. Therefore, we see frequent cases reported on the daily basis of people taking the law into their own hands. With the preferential treatment given to Rao Anwar, the credibility of the court, the justice system and the state is in question. The Sindh government needs to control the damage that it has already caused to the institutions and systems mentioned before by protecting its blue-eyed encounter specialist.
BOSTON (AP) ¬ó A purported psychic who charged an elderly Massachusetts woman more than $3.5 million for exorcisms and "spiritual cleansing" has pleaded guilty to evading taxes.
Federal prosecutors say 41-year-old Sally Ann Johnson of south Florida ran businesses that claimed to offer "psychic readings" and "spiritual cleansing and strengthening."
Between 2007 and 2014, prosecutors say a Martha's Vineyard woman paid Johnson more than $3.5 million for services that claimed to rid the woman of demons.
Prosecutors say Johnson didn't report the income and tried to hide the money so she wouldn't have to pay taxes on it.

Johnson pleaded guilty in the federal court in Boston Thursday and has agreed to repay the woman. She's expected to be sentenced in January.
Johnson's attorney declined to comment.
A late rally propelled the Joel Barlow High baseball team to a 6-2 win over host Bunnell on Monday, April 17.

Iowa's new state climatologist, Justin Glisan, says he won't be spending all of his working hours in his office in Des Moines. ‚ÄúGetting out into the state is a big thing I'm excited about,‚Äù Glisan says.
The Missouri native was hired as Iowa's state climatologist in May. He plans to travel the state as much as possible. ‚ÄúAnd talk to farmers, the ag sector, talk to any group that'll have me,‚Äù Glisan says. ‚ÄúThis is an important job and getting more people in the observation role, with a thermometer and a rain gauge in their backyard, so they can report those.‚Äù
One task of the state climatologist is coordinating a group of volunteers who report daily weather observations. The multi-state group is known as CoCoRaHS, the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow network.
The 35-year-old old Glisan is only the third person to hold the job of state climatologist in Iowa. He replaced Harry Hillaker, who recently retired after three decades in the position.
Glisan is also hoping to keep the job until he retires. ‚ÄúI really think that being in a position like this for a long time gives you an idea of how the climate of Iowa has changed or how the weather patterns have changed. Harry liked to call himself ‚Äòthe weather librarian' and I'd really want to emulate his career,‚Äù Glisan says. ‚ÄúSo, I hope I can be here for a long time.‚Äù
The state climatologist's office is part of the Iowa Department of Agriculture. Glisan is in charge of compiling weekly, monthly, and annual reports about precipitation totals, shifts in temperatures, and other climate-related data.
A 30-year-old leader of the BJP's youth wing is in a critical condition after he allegedly shot himself outside the residence of his female friend to "prove his love for her" police said on Wednesday.The incident occurred last night when the Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) leader, Atul Lokhande went to meet the 27-year-old woman's father at their home.After a heated argument between the two, Lokhande came out and shot himself in the temple. He was rushed to a nearby hospital where his condition was critical, police said.Confirming the incident, Bhopal Superintendent of Police (SP) South, Rahul Lodha, said, "The seriously injured man is undergoing treatment in the hospital. Police have registered a case in this regard an further investigation is going on."Lokhande took the step as he wanted to marry his 27-year-old friend, he added. In a Facebook post by Lokhande before taking the extreme step, he said that the woman's father asked him to come to their house in Shivaji Nagar area and prove his love for his daughter."Her father asked me to visit their home in the evening and kill myself to prove that I love her daughter. If I survived, he would let me marry her. I am at her residence, take me away from here (if I die). If I survive, I will come back on my own," he said in a long message posted at 8.56 pm."I won't be able to live without you, therefore, I am going," he added. Lokhande further said: "Many people fall in love, but no one love you like I do... I can't forget you...Truth is that I don't want to forget you... Because you are mine. I will love you forever... Till I die and even after that... All lovers give their heart, but only I will give my life."He also posted nearly 40 photos of himself with the woman and claimed that they were in relationship for the last 13 years and had even got married . "The more inter-caste and inter-religious marriages happen, the more powerful India will become," he said further.
The new Jesus and Mo strip, called ‚Äútrade‚Äù, came with a message from the pair:
We've done Reiki before, but exorcism is in the news again [JAC: see here], and the irony of exorcists being sceptical about reiki is just too tasty to resist.
If you don't know what Reiki is, it's a form of ‚Äúalternative healing‚Äù (aka ‚Äúquackery‚Äù) based on channeling ‚Äúuniversal energy‚Äù through the palms of the practitioner into the patient (see here). Many millions have been spent by credulous sufferers on this tomfoolery.

Alternet notes that Jeremy Sherman ‚Äúis a decision theorist studying how life deals with dilemmas from the origins of life to everyday and political life.‚Äù In the article below (click on the screenshot), he also shows himself to be deeply muddled about evolution. The headline is tantalizing, but the ‚Äúbiological mystery‚Äù that science can't explain turns out to be trivial: something that's eminently explainable from what we already know about life and evolution.
So what is the Big Biological Mystery? It's that organisms appear to be striving‚Äîtrying to do things. This striving takes the form of things like organisms ‚Äútrying‚Äù (I use the word as he does) to stay alive, trying to reproduce, trying to regenerate damaged bodies, trying to protect themselves from the multifarious harms that threaten every creature.
Sherman gives this appearance of striving and ‚Äúpurposefulness‚Äù a fancy name: ‚Äúfunctional fitted effort‚Äú, which he further explains this way:
Effort is purposeful work, an organism trying to achieve what is functional ‚Äì of value to it, fitted or representative of its circumstances. Effort value and representation only make sense with respect to organisms. Organisms try to benefit themselves given their environment. Inanimate things don't. In the physical sciences, there's simply no room for explanation from functionally fitted behavior. Any physical scientist who claimed that subatomic, atomic, molecular, geological or galactic phenomena as trying to benefit itself given its circumstances would be drummed out of the physical sciences. A physicist knows better than to say the moon tries to lift the tides for the moon or the tide's benefit. In contrast, in the life and social sciences, one can't do without explanations that assume functional fitted behavior. That's what's meant by an adaptation, a trait that enables an organism to engage in effort that functions for itself, fitted to its environment.
In short, what scientists can't explain are organisms. Sherman, who says he's an atheist, is not offering a creationist alternative, but simply says that here we have a big gap in our understanding of life. If rocks don't strike to protect themselves against rolling downhill, or try to repair themselves when they're cracked, or try to create other rocks, why do organisms? How could this be, given that organisms evolved from chemicals that don't show the same ‚Äúfunctional fitted effort‚Äù? (Actually, rocks do ‚Äútry‚Äù to roll downhill, and they ‚Äútry‚Äù to turn themselves into smaller rocks and then gravel and then sand. Is this a flaw in Sherman's logic?)
The obvious answer to anyone who knows biology and evolution is this: organisms are the products of genes, which themselves originated way back when, perhaps in concert with rudimentary protein-building systems, as an arbitrary point in a continuum of chemical evolution. Granted, we don't understand how life began. But once there were creatures possessing heredity material that could replicate (that's tautological!), then it's clear that those replicators who left more copies would come to dominate the population of replicators. One way replicators can do this, as Richard Dawkins pointed out in The Selfish Gene, is to build themselves a vehicle that protects the hereditary material from damage and facilitates its reproduction. Those vehicles are called bodies (I include here plants). Given bodies, the replicators will then make them behave in ways that further replication. So we get behaviors that keep you alive, repair your replicator, prey on other replicators, and, of course, have the drive to reproduce‚Äîthe sine qua non of evolution.
This is how the adaptations evolve, in both body and behavior, that Sherman sees as unexplainable ‚Äústriving‚Äù or ‚Äúfunctional fitted effort‚Äù. It's almost as if Sherman knew nothing of Dawkins's explanations. In fact, Sherman does consider the genic explanation I've just given and rejects it (I've bolded the worst muddling):
What then explains the transition from phenomena that can't be explained in terms of functional fitted effort to behavior that can't be explained without reference to functional, fitted effort? A tacit assumption in the sciences is that evolution explains it. It doesn't. This assumption takes three forms. The most popular is that evolution starts (here, 10 billion years into the history of the universe) once there are molecules that replicate ‚Äì special molecules ‚Äì probably RNA since its instrumental in life today. Once there are copying RNA molecules, there's heredity and variation. According to this view, the differences in replicating molecules is the beginning of evolution and therefore the beginning of life. This doesn't explain functional fitted effort. There's no effort. The molecules aren't trying to copy. They're passive, like any molecular products of catalysis. They copy when conditions cause them copy. Is there function or fittedness? Is anything useful or functional for the copying molecules fitted to their environment? You could say that any molecule that copied better functioned better, but given their passivity (they're not trying to copy) that's just an observer's perspective, no more about true function than it would be to say that of two balls rolled down a ramp the one that arrived at the ground first had more useful, functional features. Yes, from the observer's perspective it did but that's just an outsider's impression. The ball isn't trying to win any races. Nor is a copying molecule trying to copy, even if it happens to be the kind of molecule that, in us is functional as a repository of functional information that constrains our behavior. A repository. In us, RNA and DNA aren't making effort to benefit themselves either. Genes are not selfish. There's no self in those molecules that is trying to do anything for its own sake.
This is so dumb that I hardly find it worthwhile to reply. Molecules don't have brains and they aren't ‚Äútrying‚Äù to do anything; copying was something that happened, and once it happened all else follows. It's almost as if Sherman believes that molecules of DNA must come with little brains attached that make them consciously ‚Äútry‚Äù to replicate in the sense that humans ‚Äútry‚Äù to drive to work. His pan-psychist refutation becomes obvious when he says ‚Äúthere's no self in those molecules that is trying to do anything for its own sake.‚Äù Yes, he's right: there is no self. Selves, in their conscious form, involve epiphenomena that came much later, when big brains evolved. But evolution doesn't NEED consciousness: all it needs are molecules that can replicate, with the property that the replication isn't always perfect. (You can't have evolution without mutations.)
Later on in this muddled piece, Sherman claims, correctly, that we don't know how life began. But that doesn't mean that plausible scenarios can't be limned‚Äîor even tested. But once we have the replicators, and their ability to make proteins that build bodies (a linkage that we also don't yet understand), the rest is history: evolutionary history.
Sherman is the worst kind of science popularizer‚Äîmaybe worse than creationists‚Äîfor he's not lying, and he's not pushing religion. Rather, he's making big, non-religious claims about the lacunae of science, and yet those claims are simply wrong. Still, many laypeople who ingest his pabulum will think, ‚ÄúYes, yes, evolution must be wrong, because it can't explain organisms; and if it can't do that, well, how can it be right?‚Äù All because Sherman can't understand that the difference between rocks and organisms is that the latter have hereditary material that reproduces itself.
If you want the video version of Sherman's confusion, you can see 20 minutes of it below.
The jury is now deliberating in the Taylor Swift civil trial against (is that the right word? Against?) former DJ David Mueller who allegedly groped her ass during a meet and greet in 2013. Following Taylor's testimony last week, the judge threw out David Mueller's case against Taylor (he claims she got him fired and ruined his reputation) for insufficient evidence. His suit against her mother, Andrea, remains. And her sexual assault countersuit is also still on the table. On this week's new episode of Show Your Work, Duana and I discuss the Taylor who showed up in court, who spoke clearly and defiantly on the stand, and how she has been showing her work. How did she prepare? How did we see that preparation in her actions leading up to and during the trial, through her words in particular, and in the way she's managed this process? And does this trial mark a turning point in her career?
We may be watching a turning point in John Cho's career. He's the leading man in a new film called Columbus, directed by Kogonada who told Vulture recently that his hope for John's character is to ‚Äúrepresent Asian male sexuality‚Äù. It's been a year since #StarringJohnCho was all over social media. It's been many, many years since John Cho first started working in Hollywood. He's now 45 years old. Will he be able to enjoy the opportunities he's creating?
I mentioned the Insecure season 2 ‚Äúglow-up‚Äù a couple of weeks ago. Last week Dee Lockett wrote specifically about the wardrobe decisions on the show and ‚Äúwhy everyone has better clothes this season‚Äù. As Ayanna James, the show's costume designer, explains it's not just about having a bigger budget and pulling from high-end labels. The clothes are part of the character and part of the story. Duana and I analyse the work of the clothes and how the clothes cannot be separated from the work, ahem Blake Lively.
But what about makeup?
In this week's installment of Do We Need To Care About‚Ä¶
Makeup? And lighting?
Jessica Williams, who's currently starring in The Incredible Jessica James on Netflix, told Allure recently that she often brings her own makeup kit to shoots because ‚Äúa lot of makeup artists don't know how to work with African American skin‚Äù. Do you think Blake Lively has ever shown up at a shoot and the makeup artist didn't know how to work with white person skin? And it's not just makeup. It's also lighting. We talk about the actress-singer had to get lip injections while working on her Oscar-winning performance because they couldn't figure out how to light her mouth. This is still a problem. This is why diversity needs to happen across the board, in every department.

: RSS leader Indresh Kumar on Sunday said there were no takers for former vice president Hamid Ansari's recent "insecurity among Muslims remark" even within the community.He called the former vice president "unfortunate" as no one came out in support of his remarks."Hamid Ansari is such an unfortunate (durbhagyashali) person that no one in the country came forward in his support. Muslims in large numbers also opposed his comments," said Kumar, who was in the city today.Attacking the former vice president, he said all the while during his ten-year tenure as vice president he (Ansari) was secular and after demitting the post he has become hardliner (kattarpanti).The RSS leader also exhorted all those sharing a similar mindset to tell the name of the country where Muslims are secure."I have one request to him (Ansari) and people like him who feel that Muslims are insecure, they should tell the name of the country where Muslims are secure and they should go and live in that country where they feel secure," Kumar said.
MGM CEO Gary Barber has been fired by the studio's board of directors ‚Äî just five months after he signed a new contract that runs through 2022.
MGM Holdings made the announcement Monday evening, saying it had initiated a CEO transition and and executive search for Barber's successor. The company said Barber had led MGM ‚Äúwith distinction over the past eight years.‚Äù
MGM gave no reason for his firing. Sources familiar with the situation said Barber was blindsided by the news Monday in a meeting with board members. Barber was said to have been told the board wanted to take the company in a different direction. Sources close to the company said there had been no outward indications of discord between Barber and the board but it's understood the ouster was done at the direction of MGM chairman Kevin Ulrich, CEO of major MGM equity shareholder Anchorage Capital Group.
The timing is surprising given that Barber has been active during the past year cutting deals and partnerships with an eye toward long-term growth. MGM completed the $1 billion acquisition of Epix last September. The company recently relaunched the Orion Pictures banner and has been investing big in an expanded television production entity. MGM TV scored a triumph last year with Hulu drama ‚ÄúThe Handmaid's Tale‚Äù becoming a cultural phenomenon and landing the Emmy for best drama in its first year.

For sure, MGM is in better shape than when Barber took the reins with his longtime partner Roger Birnbaum in 2010 after it emerged from bankruptcy. Barber streamlined its Hollywood operations, cut costs and made better use of MGM's library than the previous regime of Kirk Kerkorian and Alex Yemenidjian. He sold off a number of underperforming international channels with an eye toward investing in content production. The Epix acquisition was designed to allow MGM TV a platform to launch shows that could be the monetized through international TV sales. MGM also moved to expand its unscripted TV capacity with the acquisition of Evolution Film & Tape for about $18 million last July.
On Barber's watch, MGM has released two highly successful James Bond movies: ‚ÄúSkyfall‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpectre.‚Äù After much speculation about Daniel Craig bowing out as 007, the actor is attached for the 25th Bond movie, as is director Danny Boyle, for release on Nov. 8, 2019. MGM in October took a step toward reviving its own domestic distribution infrastructure in a pact with Megan Ellison's Annapurna Pictures, although the studio is still shopping for a major distributor to handle the international rollout of the next Bond pic.
MGM for the nine months ended in September reported net income of $305.5 million on revenue of $856.8 million.
‚ÄúOver the past eight years, MGM has successfully built a world class company and talented team,‚Äù said Ulrich. ‚ÄúWith this transformation complete, MGM is uniquely positioned for exceptional future growth in the evolving entertainment landscape. Now is the right time to enable the next generation of leadership who can help drive the creativity, collaboration and partnership needed to continue the Company's positive trajectory. Looking forward, we are committed to empowering our team to take charge, innovate and execute on the promising opportunities in front of MGM.‚Äù
The board has temporarily formed an Office of the CEO to oversee the company's day-to-day operations during this period. The Office of the CEO will report directly to the board and include a group of divisional heads and senior executives.
There's speculation Ulrich may take a more active hand in running the company with Barber's dismissal. It's not immediately clear what Ulrich's move means for Barber's key lieutenants including Mark Burnett, president of TV and digital, or Motion Picture Group chairman Jonathan Glickman.
The announcement noted that the Office of the CEO will have the ‚Äúactive support‚Äù of the board of directors, including members with extensive media and digital experience: Ann Mather, formerly of Pixar, Paramount Pictures and Disney; Fredric Reynolds, formerly of CBS and Viacom; Nancy Tellem, formerly of Microsoft/Xbox Studios and CBS; David Krane, CEO of Google Ventures; and James Dondero, CEO of Highland Capital Management.
Ulrich continued, ‚ÄúOn behalf of MGM's Board of Directors, I would like to thank Gary for his contributions and for leading MGM with the highest integrity over the last eight years. Gary has played a key role in the development and execution of our strategic plan, which laid an important foundation for MGM.‚Äù
MGM Holdings announced on Oct. 5 that it had extended Barber's contract as chairman and chief executive officer of the entertainment company through December 2022. Barber and Birnbaum, formerly partners in film finance and production banner Spyglass Entertainment, were appointed co-chairmen and CEOs of MGM in 2010. Barber became the sole leader with Birnbaum's departure in 2013.

Onelink by First Alert
See at Apple
This $120 HomeKit-enabled sensor from First Alert is actually two products in one. Along with serving as a smoke detector, the OneLink can detect unhealthy levels of carbon monoxide in your home. It's sold in both battery-powered and hardwired configurations and works how you'd expect: It will alert you with an alarm in the event of a smoke or carbon monoxide emergency. Because it's smart, it'll also alert you with notifications. If you're out of your home when an emergency happens, you'll be able to know immediately.
If you choose to replace all your smoke and carbon monoxide alarms with the OneLink, they can wirelessly connect to each other over Bluetooth, automatically sounding in the event of an emergency. What's more, the wired model comes with a built-in battery back-up that will give you 10 years of juice in the event of a power outage.
With HomeKit, you can use the OneLink as part of an automation. Maybe along with the alarm sounding in the event of an emergency, you'd also like all the lights to come on in your house ‚Äî this HomeKit-enabled sensor can make that happen. You can also use Siri to test or silence the alarm in the event of a false positive. "Hey Siri, shut that OneLink off, I'm burning popcorn over here!"
Vigil@nce - Cisco AnyConnect: external XML entity injection via Profile Editor

Students are reaching out to help their classmates, making sure they, and others, don't go hungry.
Students at the Shepherd Middle and High Schools are collecting food.
It will go to the Mt. Pleasant Salvation Army and help some of their own.
So far they have collected more than three thousand canned and boxed goods for the drive.
Throughout the week, students were given incentives like extended lunches if they brought something in.
They are also taking donations for their food assistance program.
The programs allow the school to provide bags of food for students in need while they are home for spring break.
‚ÄúI think it's good for the community because it's helping people who might not need help and it's really easy for kids to bring in a couple cans to help out. I think it's really cool seeing everybody come together and helping out anything little you can do to help out it goes a long ways,‚Äù says Nicholas Raymond, High School student.
Shepherd schools are always accepting food donations to help students and the community.

Canada's self-proclaimed ‚ÄúPrince of Pot‚Äù claims smoking marijuana makes people better drivers, just days after the federal government released its highly anticipated bill to legalize pot.
Marc Emery told Global's Jeff McArthur Monday on The Morning Show that he smokes and drives every day and maintains he has never been in a car accident.
‚ÄúRemember, pot doesn't impair you,‚Äù Emery said. ‚ÄúThis idea, one of the many myths I have to clear out in the next 18 months, is that pots impairs you. Marijuana makes you more self-aware of your situation, so you'll be a better driver if you smoke pot regularly.‚Äù

Introduced last Thursday, the new law would allow adults 18 and over to possess up to 30 grams of dried cannabis or its equivalent in public, share up to 30 grams of dried marijuana with other adults and buy cannabis or cannabis oil from a provincially regulated retailer.

New penalties for offences would range from a simple police citation to 14 years behind bars.
The legislation would also permit people to grow up to four plants per residence for personal use, as well as make legal cannabis-containing products at home.
But law enforcement agencies in Canada and safety experts are warning incidents of drug-impaired driving could rise.
Data from Toronto police indicates, however, that drugged driving in Canada's most populous city represents a fraction of overall impaired-driving arrests, while alcohol impairment remains number one, with 1290 arrests in 2016.

The Nova Scotia government is seeking feedback on a legal age of 19 for marijuana use, with sales through a Crown corporation like the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation.
The province launched an online survey Friday asking for input on marijuana restrictions ahead of its legalization next summer.
READ: N.S. marijuana activists concerned with Ontario's plan for legalization
It is also asking where recreational cannabis use should be allowed, and what to do on drug-impaired driving.
Justice Minister Mark Furey says the province wants to hear from Nova Scotians as the government develops ‚Äúa well-regulated legal market that encourages responsible use and minimizes organized crime.‚Äù
He said the government's top priority is protected citizens' health and safety.
The online survey runs until Oct. 27.
The federal government tabled legislation in the spring to legalize recreational use of marijuana by July 1 and provinces have been consulting with the public or rolling out details of their cannabis plans.

On Wednesday, Alberta proposed to make 18 the minimum age to use cannabis, with no decision yet on whether to sell cannabis through government-run stores or through private operators.
Last month, Ontario announced it plans to set the minimum age at 19 and sell cannabis through government-run outlets. New Brunswick has said it will use a Crown corporation model, and a legislature committee has recommended a minimum age of 19.

Ottawa has remained firm on the start date for the new laws liberalizing marijuana, despite pushback from provinces, territories and police organizations that say it might be too ambitious given the complexity of the regulations involved.
Instead of a Wall, an Open Door: Why Ethiopia Welcomes an Enemy's Refugees
Cultural similarities have helped Ethiopia absorb more than 160,000 refugees from Eritrea, despite a still-bitter border dispute. But it's also a strategy at a time when other countries are doing the opposite. (CSM)
CS Monitor
BADME, ALONG THE ERITREAN-ETHIOPIAN BORDER ‚ÄîWhen Yordanos and her two young children slipped safely across the Mereb riverbed between Eritrea and Ethiopia late one recent night, they thought the worst of their journey into exile was over. The smuggler had done his job, and they were safely over the border.
Then they heard the hyenas.
Yordanos and her children began to yell for help, their panicked calls fading into the solid darkness. Suddenly, she saw a group of Ethiopian soldiers coming towards them. The men comforted the young families, and then escorted them to the nearby town of Badme. ‚ÄúThey were like brothers to us,‚Äù says Yordanos, who asked that her last name not be used for fear of reprisals from the Eritrean government against her relatives at home.
In some regards, Ethiopia ‚Äì and in particular this sliver of Ethiopia's arid north ‚Äì is the last place you might expect an Eritrean refugee like Yordanos to receive a warm welcome. In 1998, after all, an Eritrean invasion of this sleepy border town touched off a two-year war between the two countries that cost tens of thousands of lives and more than $4.5 billion, along with destroying most of the then-flourishing network of trade between the two countries. And before that conflict, Eritreans fought a 30-year civil war for independence from Ethiopia, which ended only in 1991.
Even today, the ashes of those conflicts still smolder. The internationally-brokered peace settlement ending the 1998-2000 war decreed that Ethiopia should give this region of the country back to Eritrea, which claims it as historical land. But Ethiopia never did, and border clashes between the two countries' militaries continue into the present.
Still, Yordanos' story is not uncommon. Fleeing enforced, indefinite military service, illegal imprisonment, and torture, about 165,000 Eritrean refugees and asylum seekers currently live in Ethiopia, according to the United Nations. Upon arrival and registration, they are automatically granted refugee status, and the country continues to welcome more. In February of this year alone, 3,367 new Eritrean refugees arrived in the country, according to Ethiopia's Administration for Refugee and Returnee Affairs (ARRA).

2018 AUBURN INVITATIONAL
Live Results
Hosted by Auburn
Friday, February 2nd ‚Äì Sunday, February 4th
25 Yards
Invitational Format
The 2018 Auburn Invitation continued today in Alabama. Swimmers competed individually in the 400 IM, 100 fly, 200 free, 100 breasts, and 100 back. Some teams also opted to participate in the 200 medley relay and 800 free relays to bookend the session. Read on for some highlights from tonight's session.
Auburn freshman standout Hugo Gonzalez picked up a win in the 200 free. Gonzalez set the pace early on, leading in 46.36 at the halfway mark as Florida's Gerry Quinn and Grady Heath trailed by just a few tenths. Gonzalez extended his lead through the back half, touching the wall over a second ahead of the field in 1:34.79. Heath came in 2nd with a 1:36.02 as he held off a late charge from teammate Dakota Mahaffey (1:36.06). Quinn wound up 4th, closely behind in 1:36.15.
Aly Tetzloff had another impressive night for the Tigers. She was dominant in the 100 fly, turning in 23.89 en route to a 51.79 victory. Teammate Ashton Ellzey gave the Tigers a 1-2 punch with her 53.89 for 2nd place. That swim for Tetzloff was a new lifetime best and her first swim under 52 seconds. Her former best, per the USA Swimming database, was a 52.38 from the 2016 SEC Championships. Tonight's victory was Tetzloff's 2nd win of the meet. She also won the 50 free last night in a personal best 22.08.
Also picking up their 2nd wins of the meet were Florida freshman Santiago Corredor and Auburn's Zoe Thatcher. Corredor, who won last night's 500 free, topped the 400 IM field tonight. Corredor broke 3:50 for the first time, dropping over 2 seconds as he touched in 3:48.53. Thatcher, who won the 200 IM last night, won the 200 free this time with a 1:47.49.
Additional Event Winners:
The Kings are expected to recall top forward prospect Adrian Kempe.
Their first-round pick from 2014 has spent two seasons with Ontario of the American Hockey League and has yet to make his NHL debut. The Kings concluded their bye week Tuesday and next play Thursday against the Arizona Coyotes at Staples Center.
The promotion of Kempe would occur after Devin Setoguchi reportedly cleared waivers and was re-assigned to Ontario.
Kempe, 20, was expected to take strides this season, his second full season as a professional, following his development in Sweden. He was thought to perhaps compete for a job, especially after early injuries to Marian Gaborik and Nick Shore, and he drew praise from Kings Coach Darryl Sutter in the exhibition season.
‚ÄúHe's just a year older, just straight maturity,‚Äù Sutter said in October. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ With the hockey IQ he has and the speed that he has, the only adjustment is experience. He's adjusted to the ice and you can see that. He's a fun player to watch.‚Äù
Kempe has 11 goals and 19 points with a minus-seven rating in 43 games with the Ontario Reign this season.
By Kanupriya Kapoor JAKARTA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Malaysian palm oil futures slipped slightly on Friday after data showed that exports from the world's second-biggest producer of the edible oil fell 8.8 percent in January. The benchmark palm oil contract for April delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange was down 0.8 percent at 2,472 ringgits ($635.97) per tonne at the midday break, touching the lowest price in nearly two weeks. Palm was down 0.5 percent on the week. Trading volumes stood at 11,118 lots of 25 tonnes each. "It looks like the market is reacting to weaker exports," said David Ng of Phillip Futures in Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia's palm oil exports in January fell 8.8 percent to 1,312,679 tonnes - the biggest monthly decline in almost a year - data from cargo surveyor Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Surveillance showed on Thursday. In other related oils, the March soybean oil contract on the Chicago Board of Trade fell 0.4 percent. The May soybean oil contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange was down 0.2 percent, while the Dalian May palm oil contract was little changed.

VIENNA (Reuters) - While much of the West has barred smoking in restaurants and bars, Austria's impending ban is set to be stubbed out. FILE PHOTO: A woman holds a cigarette in a cafe in Vienna April 10, 2015. REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File PhotoThe small, affluent country is famed for its Alpine scenery and its capital, Vienna, is regularly rated as the world's best city to live in. But many visitors are surprised to find that nights out often feature the acrid smell of decades past. Austria passed a law banning smoking in bars and restaurants as of May 2018. But that will now be overturned under a deal between the conservative People's Party (OVP) led by Sebastian Kurz and the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) reached during their ongoing negotiations on a governing coalition, according to a person familiar with their discussions. ‚ÄúThe current rules will remain in place,‚Äù the person said, confirming reports by local media. Smoking is banned in general in the restaurant industry but various exceptions are allowed. Scrapping the impending ban was an idea championed by FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache, 48, who has repeatedly tried, in vain, to quit smoking. Kurz, who is just 31, has never acquired the habit and even shuns coffee, a rare abstinence in a country with a celebrated cafe culture. Smoking was not a major issue in the election, in which Kurz made a hard line on immigration his theme. But some restaurant owners pushed for the planned ban to be dropped, supported by Strache, who has said they should be free to choose whether they allow customers to smoke. ‚ÄúOverturning the total ban on smoking in the restaurant industry is an enormous step backwards on health policy,‚Äù said Health Minister Pamela Rendi-Wagner of the Social Democrats, who plan to go into opposition once a coalition deal is reached. ‚ÄúThis shows that people's health is of no importance to black-blue,‚Äù she said in a statement, referring to the OVP and FPO by their traditional colors. The coalition deal also included lifting the smoking age from 16 to 18 and banning smoking in cars when a minor is inside, the person familiar with the talks said. While both sides have yet to clinch a coalition agreement in talks that began soon after Kurz's party won an Oct. 15 parliamentary election, a deal before Christmas is likely, people familiar with the negotiations say.

ISLAMABAD - The nation Monday celebrated 70 years of independence with a patriotic display including a giant flag and a show of airpower.
Celebrations began at the stroke of midnight with firework shows in major cities.
In Karachi the day began with a changing of the guard at the mausoleum of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, where politicians and military commanders laid floral wreaths.
At the highly symbolic Wagah border crossing, Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa raised a massive national flag on a 400 foot pole as crowds chanted patriotic slogans.
In Lahore youth cruised through the city streets on motorbikes and cars waving flags, blowing horns, and screaming ‚ÄúLong live Pakistan!‚Äù
As per their festive tradition, Lahories danced on the roads with national songs plying in their decorated cars, vans and rickshaws.
In Islamabad, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, along with top generals and foreign dignitaries, presided over a 31-gun salute and flag-raising ceremony to mark the holiday.
‚ÄúThe independence that we got 70 years ago was the fruit of the exemplary struggle of our ancestors,‚Äù said Abbasi in an address to the nation. ‚ÄúThousands of Muslims have made sacrifices for our future and the future of our children.‚Äù
President Mamnoon Hussain urged the nation to bury their differences and unite for the stability and development of the country, in his address at Jinnah Convention Centre in Islamabad.
The skies above the federal capital were later streaked with multi-coloured smoke as the Pakistan Air Force hosted country's largest air show to date.
Fighter jets criss-crossed over the leafy capital in aerobatic manoeuvres as thousands packed shoulder-to-shoulder applauded from a park below. Planes from close allies Saudi Arabia and Turkey also took part.
Up north in the Swat Valley near the restive border with Afghanistan celebrations were more subdued, with events at schools cancelled due to ‚Äúprevailing law and order‚Äù issues.
In nearby Peshawar, Christians held special services at a church and freed doves to mark the holiday. ‚ÄúFour years back my father and brother died in this church in a suicide attack, but I am still here praying for my beloved country,‚Äù schoolteacher Neelam Anwar told AFP.
Dressed in green, with Pakistani flags painted in their faces, Sikh youth and children were also a characteristic of celebrations in Peshawar ‚Äì the only city of Pakistan having considerable population of this religious minority other than in Nankana Sahib.
Speaking at the Convention Centre ceremony in Islamabad, Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Yang highlighted the significance of Pak-China ties and felicitated the Pakistani nation on its 70th independence anniversary.
He expressed China's determination to support Pakistan in its efforts for development, regional stability and securing its national interests and sovereignty.
Yang said the Chinese government desired to accelerate and accomplish the mega project launched under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor for greater economic prosperity of the Pakistani nation.
He said China wanted to further increase the bilateral cooperation in other sectors such as health, sports, academic, scientific knowledge and exchanges of cultural and academic delegations.
President Mamnoon Hussain in his address advised parents to teach their children moral values and make them demonstrate wisdom to become a source for the fulfilment of national goals.
He said that the national issues should be judged in their true perspective rather than seeing them out of context.
Mamnoon said that the poet-philosopher Allama Muhammad Iqbal and Father of the Nation Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah had encouraged the Muslims to follow the path of moderation and sagacity.
The president said the nation needed to reiterate the strong resolve to always uphold the values of determination and dedication for the objective of development of Pakistan.
‚ÄúToday let us make a firm commitment that we will adhere to our national objectives and goals. This will pave the way for better governance,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt will lead to maturity of democratic traditions, and will also strengthen the process of national progress,‚Äù he added.
Mamnoon Hussain urged the nation to rise above their minor differences and work for the solidarity and stability of the country.
‚ÄúLet us promote love and harmony by overcoming hatred and misgivings and secure the future of our nation by turning despondency into hope in order to celebrate freedom in its true sense,‚Äù he added.
The president said in the wake of challenges confronted by the country today, it was imperative to promote moderation and rationality, while availing any available opportunities.
‚ÄúIn such a situation, it is necessary to unite under the Constitution in the national interest by setting aside differences and ensure its supremacy. The Constitution is a document which will show us the path to realise national objectives by rising above our personal interests. It will also guarantee progress and stability of the motherland as a manifestation of national aspirations, God Willing,‚Äù he added.
President Mamnoon said the undeterred resolve of its people and security forces had brought Pakistan closer to success which would beget stability and prosperity, not only in the country but the whole region.
He said the whole Pakistani nation was united as a strong force for country's defence.
Later, President Mamnoon Hussain also addressed the PAF aerobatics show in Islamabad. He said that Pakistan armed forces and entire nation had always responded befittingly to the aggressive designs of the enemies of the country.
He said that both internal and external threats would be countered jointly by the security agencies and the nation.
Mamnoon Hussain said the secret to economic development lied in national unity and solidarity. He also paid rich tribute to the security forces for ensuring peace and security in the country.
The president said that the JF-17 Thunder aircraft, jointly designed by the Pakistan Air Force and China would further enhance the defence capability of the country.

The private pilot was conducting a short flight to his home airport after picking up his Cessna 182C following an annual inspection.
There were no recorded communications between the pilot and air traffic control services.
Radar data first showed the 182 about 20 miles east of the departure airport. The radar targets indicated that the plane traveled toward the southeast with the final radar target about 11 miles west of the accident site in Pattonsburg, Missouri.
Several witnesses near the accident site reported hearing or observing the airplane flying in a low altitude and maneuvering to the north, east, and south. Witnesses described the airplane as flying about treetop level.
Examination of the accident site indicated a high-airspeed, near-vertical impact with trees and terrain consistent with a loss of airplane control. The pilot died in the crash.
Post-accident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. No medical issues were identified with the pilot that would have contributed to the accident.
Probable cause: The pilot's loss of airplane control while maneuvering during low-level flight for reasons that could not be determined because examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any preimpact anomalies.

ISLAMABAD Aug 14 (APP): Blazing after-burners and
thunderous roar of fighter aircraft over the skies Monday
enthralled the people of twin cities gathered to celebrate the
70th independence Day celebrations and evoke a sense of
national pride.
The event, at the F-9 Park was also witnessed by
President Mamnoon Hussain, along with the Minister of Defence
Khurram Dastgir, Chief of the Air Staff Sohail Aman, diplomats
including the specially invited ambassadors of Saudi Arabia
and Turkey, from atop the building of Shaheen School, adjacent
to the park.
The festive event, a special, to mark the 70th
Independence celebrations, was participated by internationally
acclaimed Aerobatics teams from Turkish Air Force ‚Äì Solo
Turkey, and Saudi Hawks of the Royal Saudi Air Force, besides
the aerobatics team of Pakistan Air Force and commandoes of
the three services. The air show along with the Saudi and Turk
Air Forces reinforced their strong brotherly ties with
Pakistan.
Excited children carrying the green and white national
flags, many dressed in the national colours, donned matching
hats and goggles and shouted Pakistan Zindabad as the fighters
thundered by. Age also seemed to be no barrier as young and
old all kept their eyes fixated on the twists and turns of
their favourite aircraft in the backdrop of the hazy sky.
The thrilling show began with a flypast by three Mirages
aircraft of the Pakistan Air Force, upgraded with modern
avionics and armament packs, that dropped flares and dispersed
in a bomb burst.
It was followed by the aerobatics show by the lone F-16
known as; Solo Turk, by the Turkish Air Force, an event that
tested the machine and the pilot to the limits.
Solo Turk got a loud applause for flying past the dias
at near the speed of sound ‚Äì equivalent to 650 kms per hour on
ground. The pilot than almost hovered the aircraft at the
minimum possible speed by a aircraft of its type and waved at
the crowd before pulling it up 90 degrees, as it dispensed
flares.
The crowds around the F-9 Park started to build since
early morning and by the time the show started past the
midday, hundreds of thousands of people gathered, raising
slogans of Pakistan Zindabad and singing and dancing to the
tune of national songs. The roads leading to and from the F-9
Park were jam packed with people on motorbikes, cars, vans
carrying Pakistani flags and playing national songs.
The manoeuvres of Solo Turk included a 8-point role,
flying upside down, rolls and tight turns in which he pulled
almost 9 Gs, besides flying in a wave mode.
The six-member team of the Saudi Hawks were the next to
enthrall the record crowds by flying in different formations.
Flying the BAE Hawk aircraft the team did barrel rolls, bomb
burst, besides their signature manoeuver of forming the Saudi
government logo of a palm tree with two swords.
The most exciting manoeuvres were the ones in which two
aircraft flew in from opposite directions and zapped past each
other with less than 100 meters separation. Emitting Red smoke
they also made a heart, as another aircraft flew through it
making an arrow.
The PAF's SAAB 2000 AEW&C (Airborne Early Warning and
Control System) Surveillance aircraft also flew past the dias.
The recently inducted Augusta Westward 139 helicopters
for combat Search and Rescue missions of the PAF made their
debut and their pilots showed their skills of handling this

Cyclone and Hawkeye football fans who plan to cheer on their teams in bowl games this month will spend many hundreds of dollars for airfare, lodging and tickets, with Iowa fans shelling out the most.
Travel agent Jeanenne Tornatore says game tickets will run $63, minimum, to see the University of Iowa play Boston College in the Pinstripe Bowl in New York's Yankee Stadium on December 27th.
‚ÄúNot bad compared to a lot of the other bowl games,‚Äù Tornatore says. ‚ÄúIf you compare this to some of the huge bowl games, like the Cotton Bowl is $145 and median ticket prices to the Sugar Bowl are $375. So, think of it that way and you're getting a bargain.‚Äù It's a long drive to New York, but also it's an expensive flight. She ran the numbers to fly from Des Moines to New York, leaving December 26th and returning on the 29th.
‚ÄúNon-stop out of Des Moines to New York City was $838 while one-stop flights out of Des Moines were a little bit cheaper at $636,‚Äù Tornatore says. ‚ÄúIf you happen live somewhere in Iowa that may be the same distance to get to Chicago, that's going to be your best bet. Non-stop flights from Chicago to New York were just $304 so that's definitely the way to go.‚Äù As you'd expect, hotel rooms in the Big Apple don't come cheap.
‚ÄúThey're a bit pricey. It's the week of Christmas,‚Äù Tornatore says. ‚ÄúAlso, with these big games, four-star hotels in the city are starting at $250 per night. Three-star hotels from $165. Nothing crazy. I've seen them a lot higher in New York with different events going on. This is about the average any time of year you'd be paying to stay in New York City.‚Äù
Iowa State University is headed to Memphis, Tennessee, to play Memphis in the Liberty Bowl on December 30th. Tornatore says Cyclones fans will have to pay more for game tickets but they can likely find cheaper hotel rooms in Memphis than Hawks fans in New York.
‚ÄúGame tickets are starting at $85, so they're actually a little bit pricier than what folks going to the Pinstripe Bowl will be paying,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúFlights out of Des Moines, one-stop flights are $698 and flights out of Chicago are around $300.‚Äù While Iowa fans will be paying big bucks to stay overnight in New York, I-S-U's fans will be able to find much cheaper places to stay during their bowl game.
‚ÄúHotels in Memphis are definitely where you're going to be able to save,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThree-star hotels are starting at $127. Plenty of options, plenty of availability. Four-star hotels coming in just under $200, so Memphis is definitely more of a bargain when it comes to your lodging options.‚Äù I
owa State was allotted 15,000 tickets for the game and they've all been sold, but Tornatore says reputable secondary-market ticket outlets still have plenty of Liberty Bowl tickets available.
Increased wait times for knee and hip replacements in Alberta can be explained quite simply, says the health minister ‚Äî a lack of money.
‚ÄúThe funding in this area hasn't kept pace with the increased demand,‚Äù Health Minister Sarah Hoffman said Thursday.
‚ÄúThat's the full truth, and that's one of the reasons we added $40 million (in the budget) this year ‚Äî to address that backlog.‚Äù
Albertans needing a hip or knee replacement were, on average, waiting at least one month longer to receive their surgeries last year, according to figures released Wednesday in an annual Canadian Institute of Health Information study.
The report compares wait times across the country for several common medical procedures. It also showed declining performances for cataract and bypass procedures.
While Alberta ranked fairly well in a handful of categories in 2017, the numbers show the province's health system has slipped in several areas and is lagging behind much of the country.
No bang for our health-care buck: Kenney
Hoffman faced questions on the issue from United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney in the legislature Thursday.
Kenney said afterwards he's concerned not just about the waits, but about Albertans who end up on opioids as they await surgery.
Hoffman's mother has had two hip replacements, and the minister said most Albertans know somebody who is in pain, awaiting surgery.
‚ÄúObviously, we want the shortest wait times possible for everyone, and that's why we're increasing investment in his area,‚Äù she said.
But Kenney argues throwing more money at the problem won't work.
Alberta's health-care system has seen a $3-billion funding hike over the past few years ‚Äî about a 15 per cent increase ‚Äî and yet wait times continue to go in the wrong direction, he said.
And that's despite the fact Alberta has the highest per-capita health spending in Canada.
‚ÄúThere is a massive waste of resources through middle management in our health system,‚Äù Kenney told reporters.
‚ÄúWe're not getting bang for our buck.‚Äù
More cash coming
Hoffman said the province has initiatives in place to beef up early intervention supports to keep people out of the surgery queue in the first place.
‚ÄúBut once you're in the queue, the only solution is to get your surgery ‚Äî and that requires public investment,‚Äù she said.
Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Shaharyar Khan on Wednesday called off a round-table conference with former cricketers and experts, which was to be held in Lahore in March to address the mounting woes of the national team, to instead deal with a scandal that has rocked Pakistan cricket.
The PCB will be focusing its attention on the Pakistan Super League (PSL) spot-fixing fiasco, which has seen Islamabad United's Sharjeel khan and Khalid Latif suspended and formal proceedings initiated against them.
Speaking to media in Lahore, the chairman clarified that if the accused players did not confess, a trial court would be held by the PCB's Anti-Corruption unit (ACU) and a sitting judge would decide their fates.
He also said that the two players accused of match fixing, Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif, will be given one to two weeks to present their statements, after which the board will bring formal charges.
"We will give evidence to them which we have against them ... it's necessary to give them a chance," Shaharyar said.
Shaharyar said the PCB was aware of the fact that bookmakers were targeting players in the PSL and that was the reason players were briefed before the inaugural match between Islamabad United and Peshawar Zalmi on Feb 9 in Dubai.
The chairman also rubbished any doubts of the board adopting leniency in the matter, and clarified that in case the duo are found guilty, then the PCB will levy the maximum possible punishment as a deterrent.
Beatrice Fihn had a stark warning about nuclear war while accepting her Nobel Peace Prize Sunday.
The executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) said the world is closer to atomic warfare than it may realize.
WATCH: ICAN receives Nobel Peace Prize, says abolishing nuclear weapons is ‚Äòonly rational choice'
‚ÄúThe deaths of millions may be one tiny tantrum away,‚Äù Fihn warned while in Oslo, Norway, to accept the group's award.
ICAN is a coalition of 468 grassroots non-governmental groups that campaigned for the United Nations' Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, adopted by 122 nations in July. The treaty doesn't apply to countries with nuclear weapons ‚Äî such as the United States, North Korea and Russia.

On Sunday, the Nobel winner once again urged the remaining countries to sign the treaty.
‚ÄúIt provides a choice. A choice between the two endings: the end of nuclear weapons or the end of us,‚Äù she said.
If countries don't abandon their weapons, Fihn painted a bleak future, explaining that this time the potential for damage is far worse than it was during the Cold War.
WATCH: How Canada is preparing for North Korea missile threat
‚ÄúUnlike the Cold War, today we face many more nuclear-armed states, terrorists and cyberwarfare,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúA moment of panic or carelessness, a misconstrued comment or bruised ego, could easily lead us unavoidably to the destruction of entire cities.‚Äù

Fihn's warning comes amid rising tensions between the U.S. and North Korea. The two countries have exchanged insults and threats, while North Korea has carried out missile tests. This month, an unnamed North Korean official claimed that a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula has become a matter of when, not if.

How to pick the perfect iCloud storage plan for you!
iCloud provides a host of features, including mail, calendar, contacts, reminders, notes, sync, and much, much, more. A lot of it comes for free, but if you find yourself storing a lot of iCloud Drive documents, iCloud Photo Library content, or multiple device backups, you may need more than the 5 GB free plan provides. If you're close to the limits or have already run out, you have several other tiers to consider, from $1/m for 50GB to $20/m for 2TB. Here are your options!
iCloud storage plan options
iCloud currently offers five different subscription options. The storage that you get will be split between any and all devices you're using. This includes iPhones, iPads, Macs, and access on supported Windows computers. Your iCloud storage space will account for any files you store in any apps and your iCloud backups for all your devices.
5GB of storage - Free
50GB of storage - $0.99 per month
200GB of storage - $2.99 per month
1TB of storage - $9.99 per month
2TB of storage - $19.99 per month
What to consider before picking an iCloud storage plan
Before making a decision, it's always important to consider a few things. These are the questions you should consider before deciding on an iCloud storage plan:
Are backups already making you run out of iCloud storage space?
Do you use iCloud Drive to store your documents or are they mainly in Dropbox, Google Drive, or somewhere else?
Do you use iCloud Photo Library to store your pictures and videos or are they mainly in Dropbox, Google Photos, or somewhere else?
Are you using iCloud Drive Desktop and Documents to sync multiple Macs in macOS Sierra?
If your answers indicate you're going to be using iCloud a lot, you'll likely need the storage space to match.
Who should stick with the free iCloud option?
If you own only one iPhone or iPad and don't store a ton of things on it, or if you're already heavily invested in Dropbox or Google or another storage provider, you can likely get away with the free iCloud tier, at least for a while.
Who should get the 50GB iCloud subscription?
If you want to make sure your iPhone and/or iPad is backed up without worries, if you use a reasonable amount of documents and take some photos an video you want to sync and otherwise keep available, or if you use Dropbox or Google or another storage provider but also want the security of multiple backups with Apple, the 50 GB plan is a good place to start.
Who should get 200GB iCloud storage plans?
If you have multiple Apple devices and want to keep them all backed up, if you use iCloud Drive regularly or are building up a substantial iCloud Photo Library, or if you simply want to use iCloud as your starting point for storage, you'll likely need the 200 GB plan.
Who should get the 1TB iCloud storage plan?
If you need 1TB of iCloud storage, you probably don't need me to tell you that. You're all in. You want all your devices always backed up, all your documents on Apple's servers, and all your photos and videos up on the iCloud. If money is less important to you than the knowledge all your stuff is taken care of, the 1TB plan is there for you.
Who should get the 2TB iCloud storage plan?
Basically, this plan is designed for groups of people, like families, that have multiple iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices and use multiple services like iCloud Photo Library, iCloud Music Library, and iCloud Drive. The 2TB plan is big, but there are some of you out there that are already thinking that you wish you could get 3TB.
How to buy more iCloud storage
If you find that you need more iCloud storage, it's pretty easy to upgrade on your iPhone or iPad.
Open Settingson your iPhone or iPad. Tap on the Apple ID banner. Tap iCloud. Tap on the storage graph. Tap Change Storage Plan. Tap on an available plan to upgrade your storage. Tap Buy. Enter your iCloud account password Tap OK.
How to downgrade your iCloud Storage
If you don't need as much storage as you thought, you can downgrade your iCloud storage in much the same way that you can upgrade.
Open Settingson your iPhone or iPad. Tap on the Apple ID banner. Tap iCloud. Tap on the storage graph. Tap Change Storage Plan. Tap Downgrade Options. Choose which plan you want to downgrade to. Tap Done. Tap Downgrade.
Which iCloud storage plan did you pick?
After you've made your decision, let me know in the comments what you picked and why! Are you abandoning any existing cloud storage subscriptions to make the switch? Be sure to let me know that too!
HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's main opposition leader Nelson Chamisa made a veiled threat on Wednesday to boycott elections on July 30 if there is no agreement between the independent election agency and political parties on ballot papers.
Chamisa and his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) are the main rivals to President Emmerson Mnangagwa in the first presidential and parliamentary vote since Robert Mugabe resigned last November following an army coup.
The MDC is wary of any attempt to put it at a disadvantage to Mnangagwa and the ruling ZANU-PF party, insisting there be a deal on how to design, print and store ballot papers.
Chamisa said his party rejected the papers being printed by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC).
"We do not and will not accept the current ballot paper that has been printed without our participation," he told reporters.
Asked whether he would boycott the polls if ZEC ignored his party's demands, Chamisa said: "There will be no election, there can't be an election. Choose what to call it, but there can't be an election."
He would not reveal how the MDC could stop the vote, in which 23 candidates are running for president, but added that the opposition would not "repeat the mistakes of 2013" when it suffered a crushing defeat.
The MDC called Mugabe's victory five years ago a monumental fraud that had been engineered through manipulation of the voters' register by state security agents.
ZEC chief Priscilla Chigumba said her commission alone was empowered to deal with the issue of ballot papers, and demands by the MDC were meant to usurp its powers.
Presidential and parliamentary ballots were being produced by the central bank's printing arm Fidelity Printers, she added in a statement.
An MDC official said the party had notified police it would demonstrate next Wednesday to press its demands. Thousands of MDC supporters marched to the ZEC offices on June 5, demanding reforms that the party said were vital for a credible vote.
Zimbabwe Defence Forces spokesman Colonel Overson Mugwisi separately rejected MDC allegations that soldiers had been deployed in rural areas to campaign for ZANU-PF and intimidate opponents.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day address, touched on the Kashmir issue and said this age-old dispute can only be resolved with compassion. He said, ‚ÄúNa gali se na goli se, Kashmir ki samasya suljhegi gale lagane se.‚Äù‚Ä¢ People of India stand shoulder to shoulder with those affected due to natural disasters and the tragedy in Gorakhpur.‚Ä¢ We have to leave this 'Chalta Hai' attitude. We have to think of 'Badal Sakta Hai' ‚Äî this attitude will help us as a nation.‚Ä¢ We have pulled up Rs 800 crore benami properties. This nation is for the honest. No place for corruption.‚Ä¢ The nation stood with the women who spoke out against triple talaq. We stand by women who protested against it.‚Ä¢ Every one of the 1.2 billion population will work towards a new India in 2022, to celebrate the 75th year of Independence. No one is small or big in our country.‚Ä¢ All our security forces, our bravehearts have never faltered in protecting the country, be it protecting the nation against terrorists or during the surgical strike or helping those affected in natural calamities.‚Ä¢ India is self-sufficient to protect itself from all outside forces.‚Ä¢ Cooperative federalism has taken a new leap with GST implementation. People are amazed at how India could implement GST across the nation so successfully and across sectors.‚Ä¢ The poor and tribal people have received gas connection, they have been empowered.‚Ä¢ The young unemployed population were given loans. The homeless have been given assistance to build homes.‚Ä¢ Other nations are with us in fighting external threats and terrorism. I thank all nations who are helping us in doing so.‚Ä¢ Along with the Kashmir government, it's also the nation's concern to develop J&K and its youth. The Kashmir issue cannot be solved with either bullets or abuses, but with love. We are committed to restoring Kashmir's status as 'heaven on earth'.‚Ä¢ I was a chief minister for a long time. I know how important the states are for the nation's development. We've empowered the states with cooperative federalism. The Centre is successful in walking shoulder to shoulder with the states.‚Ä¢ We have fulfilled 21 of the schemes that I announced in last year's address. We will soon fulfill the other 50 schemes left. We cannot leave out farmers in the road towards development. We've taken forward the idea of FDI, in food processing. This will change the lives of our farmers for betterment.‚Ä¢ We have empowered the youth with funds so that instead of seeking employment, they are in a position to give employment.‚Ä¢ Our future depends on the future and security of our female population.‚Ä¢ This is the land of Buddha and Gandhi. There is no place for violence here. We will not tolerate violence in the name of faith. There can be no room for divisions. We have to move forwards together. No place for violence in the name of faith (astha). Casteism and communalism will not help the nation.‚Ä¢ We have successfully taken back all illegal money into the formal economy. Rs 3 lakh crore has come back into the economy after demonetisation. Over Rs 2 lakh crore is under scrutiny. Around 56 lakh new individual taxpayers filed Income Tax returns between April 1 and August 5. At least 3 lakh companies have been found to be shell companies doing hawala transactions. Of these, we have shut down 1.75 lakh companies.‚Ä¢ We have built airports, railway stations. The entire eastern India has huge potential to take the country to new heights. This includes West Bengal, Odisha and Northeast India. We must tap into this potential.‚Ä¢ Highway movement has eased. GST has fast tracked transportation across Indian highways. It takes 30% less time now to move on the highways.‚Ä¢ We will work towards a new india in 2022, when everyone will have a house, job. Every youth, woman will get an opportunity to fulfill their dreams. Corruption free. We'll create a clean and new nation.‚Ä¢ The upcoming January 1 is not an ordinary date. Those born in the 21st Century will turn 18 next year. They are the ones who will chart the course of this century. India invites them to come and write a new future, design a New India.

DeMonaco: Everyone always asks me why didn't I direct [the fourth film] or the TV show. I've grown increasingly disturbed by this idea ‚Äî there was an abstraction to the idea, and now that the abstraction is gone.

Do I think the Purge will happen?

Who is your Hartlepool United player of the season so far?
Scott Loach? Of course, it has to be, despite the goals from fellow summer signing Jonathan Franks, and the run of form from Keith Watson, before his untimely injury.
Competition does spur you on, not just on match days, but also during the week in training MICHAEL WOODS
But a contender for the number two spot would have to be Michael Woods.
Man of the match and match-winner in midweek against Barrow, the 27-year-old is certainly the man of the moment.
While there has been more to the revival than the former Chelsea midfielder, his restoration to the side has been no coincidence.
Hauled off at half-time in the opening match of the National League ‚Äì a 1-0 home defeat to Dover ‚Äì Woods spent the next five matches getting spelks in his backside.
But Craig Harrison ended that irritation by bringing him back at Guiseley, where Pools ended their wait for a first win.
He was a man inspired that Bank Holiday afternoon and has been ever since, a driving force for the team and, on Tuesday evening, the goal hero as he headed in a Nicky Deverdics cross in the seventh minute of added time to beat Barrow.
‚ÄúIt was frustrating,‚Äù admitted Woods, when asked about his absence from the starting XI.
‚ÄúEveryone in the squad wants to be playing, but it shows the options that the gaffer has available.
‚ÄúCompetition does spur you on, not just on matchdays, but also during the week in training. If you don't do it, you'll be sitting next to the gaffer, it's as simple as that.
‚ÄúIt's down to you and, once you get the shirt, it's yours to lose. Hopefully I can keep it a little bit longer.‚Äù
Woods is way too modest to give himself any credit, for him it has been all down to squad spirit and sheer hard work.
The stats do tell you a bit ‚Äì 17 points out of the last 24 when Woods has started, compared to two from 15 in his period on the sideline.
‚ÄúWe got together after the Fylde game,‚Äù he recalled.
‚ÄúThat was a real turning point ‚Äì there were a few harsh words spoken and we were locked in the dressing room for quite a while after that game.
‚ÄúWe're looking forward now, we're on a good run, but we haven't achieved anything yet. ‚Äú
Following the tough midweek battle against Barrow, Pools are braced for another difficult test against a side at the wrong end of the division.
Solihull Moors are second-bottom after a run of six games without a win and sacked their manager on Wednesday, with Liam McDonald making way for Richard Money, who was appointed a day later.
For all the Birmingham outfit may be struggling for results, Woods knows they will not be lacking in feet and inches, a trait he has seen most opponents in the National League.
‚ÄúThey all are,‚Äù laughed the side's longest-serving player.
‚ÄúBarrow's team were enormous!
‚ÄúThe difference I'm noticing from last year is that they're predominantly big, physical lads.
‚ÄúWalking out the tunnel, I'm looking up at the most of the players again.
‚ÄúThat's where the nitty gritty comes into it.
‚ÄúYou have to do the horrible bits of the game, to earn the right to play, then hopefully our quality will shine through.
‚ÄúWe have shown away from home, at the Orient and Woking, that we can go to teams and take points.
‚ÄúWe will be going to Solihull full of belief, for sure.‚Äù
Woods's first goal of the season ‚Äì and his second ever headed effort while at Pools lifted the roof off the Vic after being ‚Äúfrustrated‚Äù by the visitors.
‚ÄúIt was bouncing at the end,‚Äù said Woods. ‚ÄúThe fans were great.
‚ÄúThere was a bit of frustration at times, because they were quite hard to break down. They sat a lot of men behind the ball.
‚ÄúWe had some really good chances, and they did too. Louis Laing made a great block, Loachy a good save.
‚ÄúThey came for a point, so it makes it that little bit sweeter, getting it right at the end.‚Äù
So is a blood and snot 1-0 against Barrow as good as a sparkling afternoon against Maidstone?
‚Äú I think so,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen you are 2-0 up or 3-0 up with 20 minutes to go, and everyone is on the ball, flying around, those games are just as enjoyable.
‚ÄúBut nights like Tuesday will happen.
‚Äú You can't tell in this league [what's going to happen]. Everyone is beating everyone, we just need to carry on.‚Äù

As 3 February 2018 marks the Queer Azadi Pride March in Mumbai, we're publishing six compelling coming-out stories: first-person accounts of coming out about your sexuality or gender to friends, loved ones, colleagues or even to yourself. This interview was part of Harish Iyer's 'I'm Coming Out', published by Juggernaut Books, in which the personalities he speaks with explore what it means to be gay in India.
This story contains parts which some readers may find disturbing. Discretion is advised.
On a warm Sunday afternoon in 2016 I was at home glued to Facebook when I read a post by one of my friends. She was going to commit suicide. The reason behind her decision was that a relative had been accusing her of sexually preying on her female cousins. She had had enough of the bullying and had decided to end her life. She was a lesbian. I, of all people, knew how members of the LGBTQ community were subjected to such hostile accusations. I acted on impulse and quickly rang her up. She picked up after a few rings.
This was not the first time she had expressed that she was upset on Facebook. And this was not the first time I had called her after reading her update. She opened up to me, I heard her out. After she finished speaking, I asked her, "So, are you going to hang yourself or jump from the balcony?" Suddenly, she burst out laughing. I breathed a sigh of relief. I had defused the bomb. "Well, that's what all of us go through, darling," I told her, "We all are predators until proved otherwise."
She laughed.
Prachi is erratic, impulsive, lovely. Sometimes, she is also suicidal. I first met Prachi Kathale, or as we fondly call her, PK, at the Queer Azaadi Mumbai event. She was part of Umang ‚Äì a wing of The Humsafar Trust for lesbian, bisexual and transgender women. Later, she also became a part of Yaariyan, a queer youth collective forum managed by The Humsafar Trust. We hit it off instantly.
That's where it all started. And here I was, a few years later, rushing to greet her with a hug. We were at a coffee shop. She ordered a cappuccino between our chatter and quipped, "My life can be made into a film."
I quickly seized the opportunity to ask her, "How about I write your story first?"
"Sachi?" she asked, in disbelief.
"PK, tell me about your life. Where do you come from? Tell me about your family."
"I am an adopted child. I was one of those foetuses that were thrown into the dustbin."
At this point, I started laughing. "Come on, don't joke. I'm being serious here."
‚ÄòI'm serious. I am really a girl child who was thrown into the dustbin. I was later adopted by my parents."
At this point, the tone of the conversation changed. I couldn't indulge in my usual self-deprecatory talk. She was really being serious.
"So when did you find out?" I asked her.
"I was apparently born in Amravati. I was rescued by a social worker who found me in a dustbin. She picked me up and took me to an orphanage in Vile Parle, Mumbai."
"That's quite a start," I said, dumbfounded.
"I have been quite open about it. My parents are the ones who looked after me‚Ä¶ I no longer have anger or resentment towards my mother, who abandoned me. I count my blessings rather than regret that which I don't have."
"Then why do you get these suicidal thoughts?"
She laughed. "It sucks to be a minority. A gender minority. A sexual minority. Just because I'm gay doesn't mean I prey on other women in my family. By the same logic, I want to ask them, since they are straight men, should we assume all of them will abuse women? We don't, right? We find it absurd, right? Then how is it okay for someone to say the same about LGBT people?"
I agreed wholeheartedly.
"And Harish, I have been through awful things‚Ä¶' she continued, "I remember hearing your story, about how you were abused by your uncle‚Ä¶"
"Don't tell me you've been through the same thing?"
"Yes, I was raped too. And I would have been pregnant too."
A deep silence descended.
"It happened when I was just in Class 2," she said, as her voice choked, "It was during the summer vacations. My uncle‚Ä¶ he shut my mouth so hard I lost my teeth. Then he raped me. Afterwards he told me, 'If you utter a word about this, your mother will hate you, and no one will talk to you ever again.' I'll never forget his words."
"He's dead now," she said with a certain joy in her voice.
It gave me courage to break the monotony of painful thoughts and ask her jokingly, "Darling, did this lead you to become a lesbian? Like they say, you hate men so you become a lesbian."
She chuckled. She knew I was pulling her leg.
You actually don't ‚Äòturn' gay or lesbian. It is not something that is acquired by experience, whether good or bad. Sexuality is innate. I knew this. I wanted to know what she felt about it.
"I am and always have been a lesbian. I knew I was attracted to girls right from Class 3. Every time I had a crush on someone, it happened to be a girl. I have loved girls since the time I remember love. The rape had nothing to do with my sexual identity."
"But when did you realise you are a lesbian?"
"It was in Class 7 when I realised there was a word to describe who I was. Suddenly, I realised that my feelings had a name and that my sexuality was also an identity. It felt so good then. And then a year later, when I was in Class 8, I fell in love with a girl. We were in a relationship that lasted for eight years. It was like a seal of homosexuality."
"Were there any straight girls you fell for? Did you feel jealous when they liked boys instead of girls?"
‚ÄòI always wondered‚Ä¶' PK responded quickly, "I am better looking than that guy, I am more powerful than that guy, why is she not looking at me? Boys were always competition‚Ä¶"
"To make things clear for the reader, you mean only straight and bisexual boys were competition, right."
"PK, how did you come out? We live in a world where people still don't know or accept that there are different forms of sexuality. Was it difficult?"
"You know, Harish, coming out was not dramatic at all. My father and I were at dinner and I told him. I told him that I get attracted to girls. He asked me, 'Do you like any girl?' and I said yes. And he just told me to go with the flow. It was that easy."
"Wow!" I said. I was shocked. I had never heard a better coming out story in my life. "You are a lucky girl. And does your mother know you are a lesbian?"
"My school teacher and principal did me the favour," said PK.
"How?" I was intrigued.
"I was dating this girl in school. I went down on one knee with a rose in my hand. I proposed to her in front of everybody."
"Seriously, you are crazy! You know that, right?" I laughed.
"That I am. Love should be set free, right?," she said cheerily.
'What happened next? Did you get beaten up?"
"Nothing like that happened. Her family understood. My family understood. My mother thought it was a phase but she didn't react negatively either."
"What about your girlfriend, PK? Where is she now?" I inquired curiously.
Although she continued to smile, PK's eyes welled up. "She passed away in 2007. I lost her to cancer. She was a fighter. She wanted to live. But she had a small life and I had a big place in her heart."
"I am so sorry to hear that," I said softly. "So you slipped into depression after that? I would have‚Ä¶"
"Oh yes. After her, my world fell apart. It took me a lot of time to regain my strength and accept that I was alone in this world."
PK lost the love of her life in 2007. She is in a happier place now. She is as charming as charming can be. I decided to ask her if her extended family had taken it well.
"Now I am out. Some cousins have unfriended me. Some don't talk to my parents. It's okay. The lesser people in my life, the lesser the tension."
PK roams the city on her bike. She works at a BPO and is an established photographer. She has an identity. She is a brand. But she too, gets lonely, sometimes suicidal, especially when someone insults her. She is getting better with every passing year. I have seen her grow from a bud to a flower. I asked her about the lesbian dating scene because so little is known about it.
"Gay girls go after rich gay girls. There is classism here too. Also, they are quick to assume I'm butch."
A lesbian who's called ‚Äòbutch' is considered the masculine one in the relationship between two women. The one who is more feminine is called the femme. But yes, there is a world beyond all these wordy definitions of people's appearances. There can be lesbians who do not subscribe to this binary of femme and butch and just call themselves lesbians or queer.
"Are you going to start dating again?" I asked PK.
"Yes. If there's someone worthy. You know, love happens. Pyaar kiyaa nahi jaata, ho jaata hai."
I asked PK if she would like to share something with the people who are reading her interview. She concluded with this: "I know life can get very tough when the world doesn't look in the direction you are looking. I know how it feels like to be ostracised, to be teased, to be forced, to be raped‚Ä¶ but hold on to dear hope. Things will change if you believe in change."
PK is a lucky girl in many ways. She has a very understanding father. Her story is an exception, not the norm. The same is not the case with many lesbian women in India and around the world. Many are forced into heterosexual marriages and go through a lifetime of marital rape. Some women start believing that this is their life and their fate; they bear children and spend a lifetime as slaves of heterosexuality. Life is not easy when you hide your true self and try to be something you are not.
Lesbianism is not just about sex between women. We should abstain from reducing it to something like that. It is an orientation. Lesbian women dream of a lifetime with their lovers. They write poems, songs and feel their toes curl up when they see someone they are hugely attracted to. The emotions are the same.
People like Prachi define an alternate world that is filled with love. She had her challenges, still has some and will continue to face challenges, but she has won a battle with herself. She has reclaimed her life as a true, out and proud lesbian.
You can, too.
Like Oscar Wilde said, ‚ÄòBe yourself, everyone else is taken.'
If you are a lesbian and are struggling when it comes to dealing with your sexuality, feel free to call the Umang helpline or write to them at umanglbt@gmail.com. You can also reach out to them on Facebook. You can check out the Gaysi website to meet other lesbians.

BOSTON (AP) ¬ó Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey sued the Trump administration Friday for allowing more employers to opt out of providing birth control coverage by claiming religious or moral objections.
The Democrat called the actions "a direct attack on women's health and the right to access affordable and reliable contraception."
Under new rules issued by Trump on Friday, employers with religious or moral qualms also will be able to cover some birth control methods, but not others.
Healey said Trump's action is unconstitutional because it allows employers to impose their religious beliefs on their workers. She said it also violates equal protection guarantees by targeting the ability of women to access contraception.

"It is a woman who should decide, not her employer, whether she uses birth control," Healey said. "What President Trump and his administration has done is unprecedented."
"It is a terrible, terrible rule," she added.
Healey, a fierce critic of the Republican president, said the change could be felt by as many as 1.4 million women in Massachusetts and 55 million nationwide ¬ó and could cost women as much as $25 million annually to cover the costs out of pocket.
She said the rule also violated normal processes because there was no public period before it was imposed.
Healey's office filed the lawsuit Friday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts. The suit seeks to immediately block the change and have it ruled unconstitutional.
Democratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren also criticized the move.
"News flash to Republicans: The year is 2017, not 1917," Warren said in statement. "Millions of Americans use birth control to plan their pregnancies ¬ó allowing them to go to school, get jobs and plan their economic futures.?"
Supporters of Trump's decision, including Catholic bishops, called it a return to common sense. Dozens of dioceses and Catholic charities had sued President Barack Obama over the requirement in his 2010 health care law that employers provide coverage for birth control.
Catholic Action League of Massachusetts Executive Director C.J. Doyle opposes Healey's lawsuit.
"No one has a moral or a constitutional right to demand that someone else pay for their contraceptives, abortifacients or sterilizations. President Trump is to be commended for keeping his campaign promise to defend religious freedom," Doyle said, adding that Healey "believes that Catholics have no right to choose when it comes subsidizing other people's birth control."
Many others see birth control coverage as a key health care issue. That includes Hatt Kelley, visiting Massachusetts from San Francisco.
"I was a Catholic chaplain in a hospital, so I don't understand why birth control is less helpful if you are hoping to stem abortion," she said. "I think you'd want to make birth control available in that case."
Marisa Curran, a hairstylist from Somerville, Massachusetts, said access to contraception is critical for women's health and the Trump administration "needs to stay out of the bedroom."
"It's for rape victims, it's for people who, you know, can't afford to have babies," she said. "It's important for people who are having health risks because they can't have a baby because they might die."
Trump's rules change is seen as another step in chipping away at Obama's health care law that required most companies cover birth control as preventive care for women at no additional cost.
As a result of Obama's health care law, most women no longer pay for contraceptives.
New Delhi: Celebrated Indian wrestler Sushil Kumar lost his first bout in more than four years while competing at Tbilisi Grand Prix in Georgia even as his compatriot Bajrang Punia progressed to the semi-finals.
Sushil lost 4-8 to Polish grappler Andrzej Piotr Sokalski in the 74 kg category. This was not an ideal result for Sushil in the build-up to the Asian Games. The WFI had exempted him from trials held last month.
The 35-year-old was handed exemption, given his past result and form as he had won his third CWG gold in Gold Coast.
Before Wednesday's defeat, Sushil had lost a bout way back in May 2014 in Sassari (Italy) when he lost to Luca Lampis of France.
Sushil was re-admitted to the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) after a gap of two years last month.
In the 65kg freestyle, Bajrang beat Iran's Yones Aliakbar Emamichoghaei 3-1 to enter the semi-finals. He earlier defeated Ukraine's Gor Ogannesyan to enter the quarter-finals.
Deepak Punia outwitted Georgy Rubaev of Moldova in the round of 1/8 but lost 4-6 to local hope Saba Chikhradze in the 86kg quarter-finals.
Meanwhile, in the Cadet World Championships at Zagreb, Croatia, Gaurav Baliyan assured himself of a silver medal in the 71kg category after setting up the summit clash with Bagrati Gagnidze of Georgia
Aman (51kg) defeated Adem Burak of Turkey to won bronze medal. He had earlier beaten Ibrat Khabibullaev of Uzbekistan 8-6 in the repechage.
Ravinder (60kg) defeated Albania's Emanuel Cekrezi 10-0 in the repechage to set up a clash with Sabir Jafarov of Azerbaijan for the bronze medal.
Among other Indians, Sukhdev (45kg) lost 4-6 to Shakhbos Komilov of Uzbekistan, Vipul Suresh Thorat (48kg) suffered a 0-10 thrashing from Mahdi Mehrdad Veisi of Iran, Vishal Sahani (55kg) went down 4-6 to Norik Harutyunyan of Armenia.
LONDON ‚Äì Anglo American (AAL.L) unit De Beers is launching a company to sell laboratory-produced diamonds for jewelry in a departure from its century-old business model of promoting natural stones.
Real diamonds created over thousands of years remain the priority, but De Beers is responding to customer demand for more affordable jewelry using stones made in days or weeks and sold for hundreds rather than thousands of dollars.
‚ÄúThey're not to celebrate life's greatest moments, but they're for fun and fashion,‚Äù De Beers Chief Executive Officer Bruce Cleaver said of synthetic stones in a telephone interview.
‚ÄúWe have always said we are a natural diamonds business. We remain a natural diamonds business,‚Äù he said, adding that man-made diamonds used in fashion would not undermine the business for real diamonds as they served different markets.
READ MORE: Diamonds from another ‚Äòlost planet' fell in meteorite on Earth, study shows
As the world's biggest seller of natural diamonds by value, De Beers is a leader in technology and security processes to guarantee the authenticity of natural stones.
To ensure there is no confusion between man-made gems that have little resale value and the real thing, the manufactured diamonds used in jewelry will include a tiny mark showing they are made by Element Six, a unit of De Beers that until now has focused on making stones for industrial uses.
WATCH BELOW: New symbol of love gaining popularity
The technology to insert the mark has been developed by Opsydia, an offshoot of Oxford University, and the diamonds will be sold by a new company called Lightbox Jewelry beginning in September in the United States, the world's leading diamond jewelry market where demand hit an all-time high last year.
De Beers' parent, Anglo American, was hit by the commodity price crash of 2015-16, but has recovered strongly and is leading the sector this year with a 13 per cent rise in its share price.
The diamond business accounted for 16 per cent of the Anglo American group's full-year earnings.
Element Six does not publish separate earnings figures, but industry sources say it has returned to profit as recovering oil prices have increased demand for industrial stones for drill bits used in oil exploration.

If the move by De Beers into fashion jewelry gains traction, Element Six's existing capacity will need to expand.
De Beers plans to invest $94 million over four years to build an Element Six factory near Portland, in the U.S. state of Oregon, which should produce more than half a million rough carats a year when fully operational in about 2020.
That remains modest in comparison to De Beers' investment in maintaining production of natural diamonds of $3 billion over five-to-seven years.

The latest project from Tom "Tom7" Murphy is an unmodified NES running Super NES games . "Murphy breaks down this wizardry in a pair of detailed videos laying out his tinkering process," reports Ars Technica. "Though the NES hardware itself is untouched, the cartridge running this reverse emulation is a heavily customized circuit board (ordered from China for about $10), with a compact, multi-core Raspberry Pi 3 attached to handle the actual Super NES emulation."

The track and field team split its time between the Mt. SAC Relays in California and the Western Illinois Lee Calhoun Memorial Meet this weekend. The Panthers sent seven to California while the remainder of the team competed at Western.
At the Mt. SAC Relays, senior Ruth Garippo set a school record in the 10,000-meter run in her first collegiate race in the event. She placed 40th with a time of 35 minutes, 20.52 seconds which beat previous record-holder Emily Brelsfoard by 40 seconds.
Senior Ivy Handley also set a school record in the event over the weekend in the open division in which she placed 14th. Handley ranks seventh on the Eastern career list after finishing with a time of 36:35.94.
Senior Rachel Garippo is now second all-time at Easter in the steeplechase. She placed 17th at the relays with a time of 10:42.14.
Senior Julie James rounded out the record-setting performances by the women. James ran the 800-meter dash in 2:09.84, moving her to eighth on the school's career list. Senior Kristen Paris placed 17th in the same race with a time of 2:11.13.
Seniors Riley McInerney and Jamal Robinson were the only two men that competed in California.
McInerney finished 16th in the steeplechase with a time of 8:53.51. He moved into fourth on the school record list. Robinson ran the 100-meter dash in 10.69 seconds, earning him 25th place.
The Mt. SAC website boasts that the relays are where ‚Äúthe world's best athletes compete‚Äù. This year's competition was hosted by El Camino College.
The Panthers faced competitors from all across the country and across the world with competitors representing organizations from as far as Japan.
The other track and field athletes racked up 11 first-place finishes at the Western meet.
There were also three school record-breaking performances.
Senior Riley Kittridge won the shot put competition with a throw of 54'4.25‚Äù. The performance places Kittridge at 10th all-time in the event.
He also placed first in the discus throw with a mark of 161'1‚Äù.
Junior Darneisha Spann is now fifth on the EIU career list in the 100-meter hurdles. Spann won the race this weekend in 13.98 seconds.
Junior Lexie Yealey was the final Panther to move up in school-record rankings. Yealey's 153'6‚Äù discus throw ranks her fourth in the event all-time. She was also second in the shot put with a mark of 42'9.5‚Äù.
The Panthers will be reunited closer to home this weekend as the travel to Champaign for the Illinois Twilight meet. Eastern has just three regular-season meets left before the Ohio Valley Conference Championships in May.

(Reuters) - Newcastle United have completed the permanent signing of Slovakian goalkeeper Martin Dubravka from Sparta Prague after a successful loan spell last season, the Premier League club said on Wednesday.
The 29-year-old arrived at St James' Park in January and made 12 league appearances as Rafa Benitez's side finished 10th in the top flight.
Dubravka becomes Newcastle's first signing in the close season, on a contract until June 2022, after the club activated the option to sign him.
"Ever since he arrived with us on loan he has shown a fantastic attitude and great work ethic, and of course we have been very impressed with his performances for us on the pitch last season," Benitez said in a statement.
"This was one of the key positions we had identified we needed to strengthen and had been concerned about, so it is excellent news that we are able now to sign him on a permanent basis."

For months Connecticut Citizens Against Crumbling Basements (CCACB) said it would ask the feds for help if it didn't get the assistance it wanted from the state.
Last month the group acted. The federal complaint it filed with the U.S. Attorney's Office, however, will not be investigated by that agency.
On Monday, CCACB learned the U.S. Attorney's Office will not take up the case. It said the group had insufficient materials to initiate a federal criminal proceeding. Instead, the U.S Attorney's Office suggested the group ask the FBI to start an investigation.
CCACB tells the NBC Connecticut Troubleshooters it will ask the FBI to initiate an investigation in the very near future. It wants the federal government to look into its claim that the crumbling basements crisis grew for years in Connecticut without any state intervention, while insurers rewrote homeowner policies that do not cover basements that are slowly falling apart
If there is a throne to be won in music streaming, Spotify won it years ago. They've got a great selection, they've somehow gotten a better reputation for algorithms than Google, and with their Student pricing, they lure in younger listeners in droves and then hook them into staying long after they graduate. Not even Apple ‚Äî the name synonymous with music players for the last 20 years ‚Äî could make much of a dent. But there is a new challenger coming for the king. If you're going to try and fight Spotify, you need more than great value, superior selection, and fancy new features ‚Äî all of which the all-new YouTube Music has. No, you need two things that aren't found in an app's feature-list or shiny, new web client. You need brand power, and you need to have history. YouTube's brand power and history are far more storied than Spotify's, but how much of that will translate to YouTube Music this time around?
Plans, Pricing, and Device Limits YouTube Music and Spotify both offer free versions and paid versions. Neither let you download music for offline listening, but YouTube Music will pause the music when free users turn off the screen or leave the Now Playing window, which means that YouTube Music Free will monopolize your screen and thus your battery while you're listening to it.
Spotify Premium and YouTube Music Premium are both $9.99/month for a single user. Spotify offers a family plan of $14.99/month for up to 6 users at the same billing address, and a $4.99/month Student plan that bundles in a basic (ad-support) Hulu subscription. Spotify Premium can bundle with basic Hulu for non-students at $12.99/month. Spotify only has a device limit for downloads, which is 3 devices, each with a download limit of 3,333 songs, which is easy to remember and easy to hit for music addicts. See at Spotify YouTube Music Premium's family pricing is still coming, but right now, users can still sign up for a family plan of YouTube Red/Premium for $14.99/month for 6 users, and get access to YouTube Music Premium, YouTube Premium on the main YouTube app, and Google Play Music's unlimited subscription. Google has never offered a student discount on its music offerings, but if that changes, we'll let you know. The new YouTube Music is also only available right now in 5 countries ‚Äî Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, South Korea, and the US ‚Äî but Google says it intends to roll the service out to more markets like Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom down the line. See at YouTube Music Library and Selection
Spotify has over 30 million songs in its catalog, and while YouTube Music doesn't have a hard number for the songs in its service, it doesn't matter what the official number is, because that would only count the official songs YouTube Music hosts through its deals with record labels. And there is so much more to YouTube Music's selection than that. YouTube Music has official songs and albums from the record labels, and to that it adds official music videos, live concert videos ‚Äî both official and fan-uploaded, fan covers, remixes, and mashups. Then there's also the millions upon millions of songs that aren't in YouTube Music's official library, nor any official streaming library, in many cases.
Some of this fan-uploaded content is illegal. When copyright holders serve DMCA requests, YouTube pulls that content, but that's a constant game of whack-a-mole that most labels don't have the time or resources to play. There are also labels that have folded, songs that have partially or entirely lapsed rights, songs that labels have lost, and much of that is only available via fan uploads, so YouTube Music will be the only legitimate streaming service that can even hope to have them unless the service has a personal music locker. In short: Spotify has more official songs, but YouTube has far, far more music that's actually available to listen to.
The one caveat to YouTube Music's awesome library right now is that library management is still somewhat lacking. Everything you do in YouTube Music shows up in YouTube's main app, from searches to added albums to every song you listen to cluttering up your watch history. YouTube has told Android Central they "are working on making it easy to separate YouTube Music & YouTube Main watch history and will also have a way to hide playlists/albums added from Music in Main." Stations and Mixtapes ‚Äî A battle of algorithms
Spotify is known for its algorithms. From the Daily Mixes that will adjust and tweak their listening-based stations every day to the much-beloved Discover Weekly to everyday artist- and playlist-based radio stations, Spotify's recommendations are consistently lauded by tech enthusiasts and music addicts alike. They even break out the algorithm-based Daily Mixes into several different mixes so that you can get more rock recommendations without the teeny pop you play for your daughter sneaking in. YouTube Music's algorithms don't have the pedigree of Spotify's, and they only have two main mixes for users: Your Mixtape and Offline mixtape. In the new YouTube Music, all genre radio stations have been completely hidden unless you explicitly ask for them. Once you get a station going, though, Google's stations shine like the diamonds in the rough they are.
YouTube Music's station offerings seem inadequate, but only until you listen to one. Your Mixtape may be a bit diverse in its genres since everything in one mix, rather than separated by genre/type like Spotify, but Your mixtape dials into your tastes very quickly. YouTube Music has years of YouTube history to feed its radio algorithms as well as the recommendations that litter the Home feed. Spotify's algorithms may package things a little better with Daily Mixes 1-7, but those 7 mixes still haven't learned me as well in months as YouTube Music has in a week. Then we have Offline Mixtape, one of the features of the original YouTube Music. Offline Mixtape takes the algorithm from Your Mixtape and uses it to generate a playlist that is regenerated and re-downloaded daily. You choose how many songs the playlist includes, up to 100, and it presents you with a new mix every day to rock out to during your commute. Offline Mixtape is a downloadable Daily Mix, something that not even Spotify's many mixes can do. Stability and Sound Quality YouTube Music is in the "Early Access" stage right now, and it is quite clearly not a final product. There are serious UI bugs, especially when using the app offline, casting, and trying to manage or browse your own library, as every category in Your Library is sorted by date added rather than name.
YouTube Music's audio quality right now is also rather average. Spotify offers audio streaming qualities up to 320 kbps via Spotify Premium's "Extreme" audio quality option, whereas YouTube Music's current music quality in the app is about 128 kbps. YouTube Music has told Android Central that more robust audio quality settings are coming in an upcoming update. Spotify also has Android Auto support, something every music subscription service should have in 2018, and video-based YouTube Music needs it even more than most. For now, YouTube Music sounds fine unless you're an audio snob, and it's a bit buggy. We expect things to improve soon, but we have to compare what we have right now. Why Spotify is better right now‚Ä¶
Spotify has almost a decade head-start over YouTube Music: a decade to build a loyal user base around the world, one of the best-known brands in music, and enough history with its users to deliver consistent and consistently awesome mixes to its users daily, weekly, and yearly. It's also had a decade to smooth out its rough edges and refine their experience, while YouTube Music is still firmly in the growing pains stage of its development. Spotify is still the clear winner for students, as $5/month for Spotify Premium and Hulu is pretty hard to beat, and by the time the Student discount ends, most users have too deep a library and history in Spotify to just pick up and move to a new service. Read more: Everything you need to know about Spotify ‚Ä¶and why YouTube Music is going to dethrone it sooner than you think Spotify has built itself up as one of the biggest names in music, but its brand power is still a drop in the bucket compared to YouTube, which is one of the most-visited sites on the internet. YouTube's brand power even extends to music already ‚Äî from the most viewed music videos ever to viral covers from upcoming artists, from mind-blowing remixes to that one song that you can't remember the lyrics to.
You already use YouTube for music. Google just needs to convince you to pay for it. YouTube Music has a few very compelling arguments already ‚Äî if you're a free user, you have to keep the screen on the whole time, which is a battery drain and keeps you from using your phone for anything else. You also can't download music for offline playback without Premium, which is a more common practice. However, the most compelling reasons for subscribing aren't even in YouTube Music ‚Äî at least, not today. YouTube Premium is $2/month more than Music Premium, and is the no-brainer for anyone considering paying for a YouTube subscription. For $2 more, you get offline and background playback on all of YouTube instead of just on YouTube Music content. You get rid of YouTube ads on all of YouTube, and you get access to YouTube Originals, should you need any more freebies thrown in.
Then there's the news that Google Play Music is going to eventually give its best feature to YouTube Music: its music locker. Google Play Music's free, 50,000-song music locker is something that doesn't really have a rival on the market right now. If a user can't find a song in Google Play Music's subscription library, they can upload it to their library themselves. That's invaluable, and it's coming to YouTube Music, which will combine the biggest, baddest music subscription catalog on the planet with the ability to patch any conceivable hole in it a user finds.

The machines are taking over! By all means this is not about the 1987 hit movie "Robo Cop" but as facts would have it a reality.
In the 1987 action film, Officer Alex Murphy is murdered by a group of criminals. His body was then revived by the OCP, remodelling him into a "half man half machine" cop enlisted with the police to fight crime.
As we would have it right now, the Dubai police has recruited the "Dubai RoboCop" into the force to help combat crime in the streets of the Middle Eastern tourist hub.
According to reports, the Dubai RoboCop can identify wanted criminals and even collect evidence from crime scenes.
Adorned in the colors of the Dubai Police Force, though it still looks like a robot, it shakes hands, salutes in the military style, reads license plates, recognises faces and possesses an inbuilt camera which police use in monitoring activities around it.
According to the Dubai Police, the Dubai RoboCop will work 24 hours a day with no maternity leaves or breaks unless there is a circuit malfunction.
The robot also talks to people and crime reports can be made to it.
From the look of things, it won't be long before you see RoboCop on your streets, that's if you don't live in Dubai.
What's your take? Is this a good or a bad idea?

DEVILLE ‚Äî Buckeye Panthers hosted Leesville in the annual Squirrel Bowl to kick off the District 3-4A slate and Leesville made a big statement, handing Buckeye a 42-7 home loss.
Leesville scored quick and often, holding a 28-0 lead at halftime.
Buckeye was without its star running back Austin Daily who left the game on the Panthers first offensive drive with an apparent concussion and that really caused some pain to the Panther offense.
The Wampus Cats were able to turn a 28-0 halftime lead into a nearly insurmountable 42-0 lead after a 15-yard touchdown run by Dante Gallashaw in the third quarter and a four yard touchdown run by Jalen Shepherd in the fourth quarter.
Buckeye was able to find the end zone one time during the game on a 15-yard run by Justin Belgard.
SCORING SUMMARY
Leesville 14 14 7 7 ‚Äî 42
Buckeye 0 0 0 7 ‚Äî 7
NOTABLE
Buckeye senior running back left the game and did not return after a concussion in the first quarter. Daily was the second leading rusher in Central Louisiana heading into this game.
Leesville had 333 offensive yards compared to only 203 for Buckeye.
Leesville had nine penalties for 45 yards while Buckeye had only two penalties for 12 yards.
Buckeye dominated the time of possession in the loss, holding the ball for 30:49 of the 48-minute game.
The Wampus Cats had 19 first downs compared to 14 for Buckeye.

THEY SAID IT
Leesville junior quarterback Chris Vargas
‚ÄúWe came in knowing we needed to bounce back after last week's loss to Rayne. We know we are the type of team that can bounce back and we have the talent to do so and that's what we did. It feels good to open district with a win. I believe in my teammates and we have great coaches that push us every day.‚Äù
Leesville head coach Robbie Causey
‚ÄúIt was a hard fought victory. We know that anytime you come to Buckeye it's gonna be a tough game with what they do. They are very physical up front on both sides of the ball and they are so efficient in running the triple option. It is hard to replicate that offense in practice in the live speed in which they run it so that had me worried. We were coming off a hard fought loss last week and how we would handle it plus the short week this week with the fair in town. You know how teenagers are when it is fair week, you aren't sure how they will handle it. Every week is different. Your opponent is different, your preparation is different, the matchups are different. I tell them all the time it's not what you have done it's what you are going to do so we need to put this win in our back pocket and start getting your mind right for the next one.‚Äù
Buckeye head coach Jonathan Landry
‚ÄúWe could have held onto the ball better and sustained some drives. We knew they would be explosive on offense and we would have some trouble covering the pass but our kids fought hard but we just didn't execute well. We aren't sure the extent of Austin Daily's injury yet. He left the game and went to the emergency room to get a CT scan done. That was definitely a big blow because he has been our workhorse this season rushing for over 700 yards and we lost him on the first drive. It hurt us offensively and also hurt us defensively because we had to put our middle linebacker at fullback. None of that matters though and we hope and pray that he is OK and hopefully we will get a good report on him.

Sony Pictures had the first major studio presentation at CinemaCon in Las Vegas yesterday, the biggest convention for exhibitors around the world, where the studio unveiled a new trailer for their upcoming animated movie Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. While the trailer has not yet officially arrived online yet, the footage did confirm some interesting details, including the fact that Jake Johnson has been set to provide the voice of Peter Parker. The footage also offered a glimpse at three iconic comic book villains that will be featured in the animated adventure, the Green Goblin, Kingpin and The Prowler.
Last year, Sony confirmed that Shameik Moore has signed on to provide the voice of Miles Morales, while Liev Schreiber was brought on to voice an unspecified villain, although he has still not been identified yet. Since this new footage showcases both Green Goblin and Kingpin, it's definitely possible that he could be voicing one of these villains, but it isn't known when Sony plans on releasing a full voice cast list. The trailer did feature Peter Parker, and while he didn't speak during the footage, it was later revealed that Jake Johnson is voicing Peter Parker.
Even though we now know who provides the voice for Peter Parker, he may not have a substantial role. In the first trailer that was released back in December, Miles Morales was seen visiting a grave, which many speculated was in fact the grave of Peter Parker, which would follow the Ultimate Spider-Man comic book continuity. This CinemaCon trailer confirms that Peter Parker does in fact die during a battle with the Green Goblin. The only other cast members that have been confirmed at this time are Brian Tyree Henry (Atlanta) as Miles' uncle, Aaron Davis, a.k.a. The Prowler, and Oscar winner Mahershala Ali (Moonlight) as Miles' father, Jefferson Davis.
With just under eight months left until Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse hits theaters, it remains to be seen when Sony will release more details about the voice cast and the story. Given the details gleaned from the trailer and this new footage, this story will be based on the Ultimate Spider-Man comics, which is where Miles Morales first appeared, created by Brian Michael Bendis and Sara Picheli. It seems unlikely that there will be any connection to the live-action Spider-Man franchise, since Tom Holland played Spider-Man in Spider-Man: Homecoming and Aaron Davis/The Prowler was played by Donald Glover.
Sony Pictures has issued a December 14 release date for Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, putting it up against 20th Century Fox's Mortal Engines. It will also arrive one week ahead of a packed holiday frame including 20th Century Fox's Alita: Battle Angel, Warner Bros.' Aquaman, Paramount's Bumblebee and Sony's Holmes and Watson. Sony Pictures has not revealed when this CinemaCon footage will be made public, but hopefully we'll have more details soon. Jake Johnson can currently be seen in the final season of Fox's New Girl, and he stars in the upcoming summer comed Tag, hitting theaters June 15. Head on over to Geek Tyrant for their report on the CinemaCon presentation.

SAINT-PAUL-DE-VENCE-Fashion giant Louis Vuitton bent the knee to legendary Vogue stylist Grace Coddington in a show in rural Provence paying tribute to her daring through the decades.
The Welsh-born creative director at large for American Vogue magazine is credited with creating some of fashion's ‚Äúmost memorable imagery‚Äù and is known as ‚ÄúAmazing Grace‚Äù to her many fans.
Vuitton designer Nicolas Ghesquiere even sent several red-haired models weaving down a catwalk between Miro sculptures at the Maeght Foundation art gallery and gardens on Monday in a nod to Coddington's own trademark mane. The 77-year-old was the longtime righthand woman of Vogue editor Anna Wintour, and the star of an acclaimed 2009 documentary about the iconic magazine, ‚ÄúThe September Issue‚Äù.
Ghesquiere, who has just renewed his contract with fashion's richest luxury brand, said he wanted to celebrate Coddington's unique eye, and the way she juxtaposes clothes and designs no one else would dare to.
‚ÄúEccentricity is to define your own personality and to mix things in a unique way,‚Äù he told AFP. ‚ÄúFor me, Grace with her very strong style represents a kind of eccentricity.‚Äù The designer tried to recreate that glorious individuality in 59 looks which covered her time as model in the London of the swinging sixties right up the present.
With Coddington looking on, ‚ÄúBeautiful Mind‚Äù star Jennifer Connelly read from her memoir, ‚ÄúGrace‚Äù, as the models traipsed around the artworks in the foundation's gardens at Saint Paul de Vence, in the hills behind the French Riviera. Connelly's fellow film stars Emma Stone, Isabelle Huppert and Lea Seydoux were also on the front row to see a collection that was strong on a typically Coddington mix of short skirts, Prince of Wales check jackets and lots of spots, stripes and flower motifs.
Coddington also designed some of the accessories to go with the cruise collection, with her illustrations of dogs and cats intertwined with Louis Vuitton's famous monogram. Ghesquiere said he also drew inspiration from works in the Maeght gallery, which includes work by Balthus, Bonnard, Braque, Calder, Chagall, Giacometti and Leger.
‚ÄúI also wanted to pay homage to this place, which for me is the genesis of (all the other) art foundations. It is a love story between a family, artists and architecture,‚Äù he said. The Louis Vuitton Foundation opened its own art gallery designed by Frank Gehry in the Bois de Boulogne on the edge of Paris in 2014.
EDWARDSVILLE ‚Äî New storage compartments under the pavilions at Leon Corlew Park and Splash Pad offer an ideal framework for a new program called Create Art for Leon Corlew Park.
The new storage cubbies were designed with a functional purpose in mind, offering convenience for visitors to store personal items during the summer or when enjoying the dry playground. The open-air cubbies are well-suited for placement of items like flip-flops, towels, or extra sunscreen.
Katie Grable, assistant director of parks and recreation, saw an opportunity to create art on the structures' backside.
‚ÄúWhen the cubbies were installed, I noticed that the backside lacked personality and saw an opportunity to create something fun for the children in the community to participate in,‚Äù Grable said. ‚ÄúWe are offering a chance for children 14 years old and under to submit artwork based on the theme of Outdoor Activities Around Town. The artwork will be used to create an oversized compilation mural that will be installed on the back of each cubbie structure. Eventually, the park will have four storage structures.‚Äù
Forms for submitting the artwork can be picked up at the city of Edwardsville office and the Edwardsville Arts Center, and can be downloaded from the city's website link on the Parks and Recreation home page. The arts center will also be offering a Create Art for Corlew Park class on Saturday, March 31, at their art center. Children can stop in and submit their artwork between 11:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. For those unable to attend, completed artwork forms can be submitted to the city of Edwardsville office, attn: Katie Grable, 118 Hillsboro Ave. in Edwardsville. Electronic copies can also be accepted by emailing kgrable@cityofedwardsville.com. Artwork space is limited, so there is a limit of one entry per artist. For information, contact Katie Grable at (618) 692-7538.
‚ÄúWe look forward to the unique artwork we are going to receive,‚Äù Grable said. ‚ÄúIt's really going to add some beauty and creativity to Leon Corlew Park to be enjoyed for years to come.‚Äù

Robert Englund is a living legend known for portraying Freddy Krueger in the Nightmare on Elm Street series. While he'll likely never return to that role, he hasn't given up his passion for acting. And in the horror world, a new Robert Englund movie is a cause for celebration, even if it's a low budget schlock fest that goes straight to VOD. The later half of that sentence may be true for his latest terrifying outing, a dark thriller called Nightworld. But it actually looks like a scary movie that will have horror fans excited all over again.
Robert Englund stars in Nightworld, which has the iconic actor fighting off a malevolent force while coming face to face with a very dark afterworld. Bloody Disgusting debuted the first trailer, which you can see below. They also have the first poster, which features an eery looking Englund who wears dark shades to cover up his glassy eyes. Standing alongside him is Jason London, perhaps best known for his performances in Man in the Moon and Dazed and Confused.
In Nightworld, When Former LAPD Officer Brett Irlam Jason London takes a job as head of security at an old apartment building in Bulgaria's capital, Sofia, he soon begins to experience a series of bizarre and terrifying events. Once he begins to delve deep into the building's sinister history, and investigate it's shadowy owners and past employees, Brett soon uncovers a malevolent force nestled deep in the bowels of the building basement that will do anything to be set free into our world.
Robert Englund plays the former head of security for the old apartment building. In the trailer, he comes to help London when mysterious things start to go bump in the night. At one point, he removes his dark glasses to reveal that his eyesight was taken from him while on the job.
Instructed not to go into certain areas of the building by himself after hours, Irlam, in true horror movie fashion, disregards those warnings and goes anyway. We soon learn that he has a late wife. And as Brett delves deeper into the building's mysteries, he comes face to face with his old spouse, who has seemingly risen from the dead. Englund delivers this scary bit of advice, which no one heeds until it's too late.
"If you do not do as I ask, everything you know, everything you love, will end."
Robert Englund recently appeared at Monsterpalooza in Pasadena, California, which has become the Comic-Con of horror. He was there to mostly talk about his long tenure with the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. But he also opened up about Nightworld in his Sunday Q&A. Addressing an at capacity audience, he declared Nightworld one of the scariest scripts he's read 'in a long time'.
The trailer originally had its world premiere at Monsterpalooza, wowing the crowd in attendance. As you can see, it looks pretty scary, and is not your average straight-to-DVD affair. Patricio Valladares directs the supernatural thriller, which was recently picked up by VMI Worldwide.
The Nightworld story is by Barry Keating, with Loris Curci and Milan Konjevic writing the script. The movie will arrive later this year, and could get a small theatrical debut before heading starting to Blu-ray and VOD. We have the trailer and poster for you to check out. It may not be A Nightmare on Elm Street, but it has the potential to be a new horror classic.

Cape Town: 'Day Zero' is approaching, as South Africa's showcase city of Cape Town prepares to turn off most water taps amid the worst drought in a century. Tensions among the four million residents are highlighting a class divide.
The top international tourist destination has both sprawling informal settlements and high-income oceanside neighborhoods. Some say poorer residents are unfairly blamed as concerns rise over wasting precious water. The military is prepared to help secure water collection points if 'Day Zero' occurs.
AP is exploring how residents are coping as water restrictions tighten in an attempt to avoid the possible shut-off in April, and it spoke with researchers about where the water usage problems lie.
Kirsty Carden with the Future Water Institute at the University of Cape Town pointed to the city's leafy suburbs. "It has been in the areas where people have gardens, they have swimming pools and they are much more profligate in the way that they use water, because they're used to the water just being, coming out of the taps," she said.
About a quarter of Cape Town's population lives in the informal settlements, where they get water from communal taps instead of individual taps at home, Carden said.
"And there are always pictures of running taps and broken fixtures and "look at the leakage" and all the rest. But the reality is that those 1 million people out of a population of 4 (million) only use 4.5 percent of the water," she added.
In one of the crowded settlements of corrugated-metal homes, resident Vuyo Kazi washed her laundry outside as others poured used water into the street. "Before, I was using two kettles of water to wash myself," she said. "So now I use one kettle of water."
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) ‚Äî A man accused of beating his grandmother to death in Sparta in August will stand trial.
The judge ruled Friday there is enough evidence against 23-year-old Matthew Malleaux, who was charged with the beating death of his 85-year-old grandmother, Anne Parker, at her Sparta home.
Police said Malleaux had been drinking heavily and became angry when his grandmother's Care Link medical alarm started going off, which was when they began to argue and he turned violent.
The alarm brought first responders to the house, where they found Parker on the ground inside with several injuries. She was taken to a hospital but died the next day.
In a hearing Friday, a Michigan State Police detective who interviewed Malleaux twice testified about her second conversation with him at the jail.
‚ÄúHe said he put his hands on her shoulders and then he did a shaking motion,‚Äù Detective Sgt. Denise Bentley said. ‚ÄúAt one point he said there was some type of frenzy and there was a headbutt.‚Äù
Despite that, Malleaux also told police he did not hurt his grandmother, and that she had tripped and fallen down the stairs.
However, the medical examiner ruled the death a homicide, testifying Parked suffered around 20 blows to her body that weren't consistent with falling down the stairs.
Police said Malleaux waived his Miranda rights before being interviewed by detectives. On Friday, his defense attorney raised questions over whether or not he specifically asked for an attorney and didn't get one.
The issue is likely to be brought up again during the trial.
Malleaux is also facing charges for resisting and obstructing for being accused of throwing a large cement object at an EMT when police tried to subdue him the night of his arrest.
In December, he was found competent to stand trial, which does not have a set date at this time.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi Monday called on all parties concerned to abide by relevant UN resolutions on the Korean Peninsula issue. Wang made the remarks when meeting the press after talks with visiting Mongolian Foreign Minister Damdin Tsogtbaatar. He was asked to comment on the US decision to consider imposing more sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) after its recent missile test.
‚ÄúAfter two months of relative quiet, tensions on the Korean Peninsula have increased again,‚Äù Wang said. He added that it was a regret that the parties involved failed to seize on China's appeals. ‚ÄúChina has always been open-minded to new propositions to resolve the issue, however, the stipulations and spirit of UN Security Council resolutions should be a common principle for all parties to follow,‚Äù Wang said, adding that UN Security Council resolutions represent the common will of the international community.
Wang said China has fully implemented relevant UN resolutions on the issue and opposed the nuclear and missile programs of the DPRK. He said China firmly opposes actions to increase the tension on the Korean Peninsula and has always been working to promote peace and dialogue in accordance with all previous UN resolutions.
‚ÄúPropositions and measures that are against or not included in the resolutions lack international legal support and will jeopardize the execution of UN resolutions,‚Äù Wang said. The Republic of Korea and the United States launched a large-scale joint aerial drill Monday. The Vigilant Ace drill will run until Friday.
‚ÄúThe situation on the Korean Peninsula is highly sensitive, and we hope that relevant parties can avoid provocation and do more to ease tension,‚Äù Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said later Monday.
CAIRO (Reuters) - Arab foreign ministers late on Saturday urged the United States to abandon its decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, saying the move would increase violence throughout the region.

The announcement by President Donald Trump on Wednesday was a ‚Äúdangerous violation of international law‚Äù, had no legal impact and was ‚Äúvoid‚Äù, the Arab League said in a statement after a session attended by all its members in Cairo.
Trump's endorsement of Israel's claim to all of Jerusalem as its capital would reverse long-standing U.S. policy that the city's status must be decided in negotiations with the Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.
‚ÄúThe decision has no legal effect ... it deepens tension, ignites anger and threatens to plunge region into more violence and chaos,‚Äù the Arab League said at 3 a.m. local time after hours of meetings that began on Saturday evening.

It said it would seek a U.N. Security Council resolution rejecting the U.S. move.
Lebanon's Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil said during the emergency meeting that Arab nations should consider imposing economic sanctions against the United States to prevent it moving its Israel embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.

‚ÄúPre-emptive measures (must be) taken ... beginning with diplomatic measures, then political, then economic and financial sanctions,‚Äù he said, without giving specific details.
The Arab League statement made no mention of economic sanctions.
Arab criticism of Trump's plan contrasted sharply with the praise Washington's traditional Arab allies heaped on him at the beginning of his administration in January.

Evangelical Voters And Roy Moore
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
Alabama Senator Richard Shelby made a statement yesterday.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
RICHARD SHELBY: I couldn't vote for Roy Moore. The state of Alabama deserves better.
INSKEEP: The Alabama Republican says he could not follow the national Republican Party and back the party's Senate candidate. In a special election, Shelby told CNN he wrote in another Republican on his absentee ballot. The white evangelical vote is a big part of the Alabama electorate, and we've called Penny Young Nance, president of Concerned Women for America, which is a national evangelical group based in Washington. Good morning.
PENNY YOUNG NANCE: Good morning, Steve.
INSKEEP: So, as you know, Roy Moore supporters have said just focus on the votes that they think he'll cast once he's in the Senate. Would you be able to do that?
NANCE: That would be a very difficult decision, and, frankly, I'm glad that I don't have to make it. But, you know, we're watching nationally this unfolds. It's almost like turning on the light switch and watching the cockroaches scatter as, you know, media falls, I mean, in NPR and The New York Times and, you know, around the country. And then, of course, corporations have had their problems in the past, and now it's government, and it's very serious. We have called on Congress to give out publicly and be transparent about the members of Congress who have had sexual harassment settlements to the tune of $17 million. We believe very strongly that the American people have a right to know how their tax payers were spent in this issue.
INSKEEP: Well - so you feel this is a very important subject, but here's Roy Moore, he's accused of having had inappropriate relations or even assaulting teenagers, including one who was as young as 14. He's denied - effectively denied everything. Does that make him someone who's worthy of being in the Senate?
NANCE: Well, I think that's a question for the people of Alabama. I mean, that's what they're going to decide tomorrow. They have - unfortunately, the Democrats could have won this handily if they'd been willing to put forward a pro-life Democrat. You know, in the past, we had plenty of those. And slowly but surely, they've been run out of the party. This is going to be - 2018 is going to be a very close election. The numbers in the Senate are 52-48. I counted about nine races that would be competitive if they would be willing to support pro-life Democrats.
INSKEEP: Sounds to me like in spite of the accusations against Moore, this is still a dilemma for you and maybe still a dilemma for many Alabama voters because of abortion.
NANCE: That's correct, and the issue of the Supreme Court. But let's - and so let's think about that for one second. This is a terrible accusation that was held until, you know - what? - a month before the election. I think there still needs to be due process. I think people of Alabama need to go forward in the state looking at the allegations. But what the people of Alabama are troubled by is the fact that Doug Jones supports abortion, even late-term abortion that requires dismemberment of a baby. And so that's...
INSKEEP: Let me just stop you there. I'm sure that Doug Jones would describe it differently. But we'll just note there's been a lot of discussion about abortion for sure.
NANCE: I'm sure he would.
INSKEEP: But let's just focus here for a moment on sexual harassment. This clearly is an issue that troubles you - not quite enough to say that Roy Moore should not be elected. And is it correct that you...
NANCE: No, hold on. I am saying that this needs to be investigated.
INSKEEP: OK.
NANCE: The Washington Post held this until the very last moment. And so the question is whether it's true or not.
INSKEEP: I wouldn't - I would say I'm not sure that they held it either. It seems to me they sent a reporter down and learned it.
NANCE: Well, I don't know. He ran nationally twice. And this did not come up and then he came up about a month...
INSKEEP: Well, he ran in statewide elections. That's true.
NANCE: Oh, sorry, excuse me, correct, statewide.
INSKEEP: Understand.
NANCE: And it absolutely should have come up before now. If it was an open secret, as they suggested, then it should have come up. So the question is why is it just now - I'm not saying it's not true. Every woman deserves to be heard. I personally come from a background of being a victim of physical assault, attempted rape on a running trail in Virginia. I tend to believe the accuser. But there has to be due process. In all of these matters, everyone deserves that, whether they work at NPR or whether they work in Congress. But we must just look at it.
INSKEEP: Just so we know, that experience - I think you've written about it. This was a boss who - or is that a different experience?
NANCE: No, I'm sorry. I - unfortunately...
INSKEEP: You've had more than one.
NANCE: I also have an - I've written about that. Unfortunately, I was - the difference is sexual harassment versus attempted assault.
INSKEEP: I understand.
NANCE: And those are very difficult subject matters to talk about, but it does give me the perspective, the fact that this is real, and the powerful prey on the weak. And we cannot turn our faces as evangelical Christians away from the suffering. But we deserve to give everyone their say.
INSKEEP: Penny Young Nance - president and CEO of Concerned Women for America. Thanks very much.

Drew Goddard has commented on how the arrival of the new team in Deadpool 2 influenced the direction for the upcoming X-Force movie. The promotional campaign for the Merc with a Mouth's second big screen offering introduced X-Force, which was pretty exciting since it had been previously announced that Goddard was on board to helm the X-Force movie late last year. However, things didn't really go the way many thought that they were going to go while watching the sequel in theaters. There are SPOILERS for Deadpool 2 below, so read ahead at your own risk.
While X-Force is introduced in Deadpool 2, they don't really make it too far past that introduction sequence, since all of the new members of X-Force end up dying before they can hit the ground and get into battle. Even though the scene was taken directly from the comics, it was still very much a shock to everybody sitting in the theater. So, what does that mean for the X-Force movie? As it turns out, Drew Goddard always wanted to have the focus on Deadpool, Cable, and Domino from the start, so the events of Deadpool 2 weren't that big of a deal. He explains.
"When I think of the comics, I think of Cable and Domino and Deadpool, and it's really just knowing, Oh, right, there's a world in the X-Universe for the blunt instruments of mutantdom. It's much more about the characters and my love for them than it is about any plot or story line. It's more about loving them and wanting to see them bounce off each other."
Speaking further about the radical introduction of X-Force in Deadpool 2, Drew Goddard said, "To be honest, I think that's why it excited me so much." Ryan Reynolds and crew threw a huge curveball at audiences and at Goddard, but that was the allure to the project for the director. Goddard was more concerned with the Reynolds and David Leitch taking their time to craft Deadpool 2 and not have any restrictions. He had this to say.
"One thing I said to Ryan was, Don't worry about it, we'll come up with new ideas; you guys go make your movie, and do your thing. We'll figure it out. That tends to be the way I like to work. It's much more important to focus on making the movie that you're making than focusing on the next thing. It's much more important to just make one good movie and take your time, then let that dictate what the movies are after."
Drew Goddard seems to enjoy a challenge, but it doesn't appear that Deadpool 2 really had much of an effect on X-Force, except for introducing Cable and Domino. Since those characters, along with Deadpool, were always going to be the focal point to begin with, Goddard can start from scratch and make a movie that is just as surprising as Deadpool 2 was. Hopefully, if he does decide to introduce some more characters, they stick around a little longer this time around.
Ryan Reynolds has recently said that X-Force will be Deadpool 3, so Drew Goddard's decision to put most of the focus on the Merc with a Mouth, Cable, and Domino makes more sense now as well. It will be very interesting to see how they take these characters and have them riff off each other for an entire film. While we wait, Deadpool 2 is in theaters and still making a killing at the box office. You can check out the rest of the interview with Drew Goddard and his plans for the X-Force movie at Entertainment Weekly.

International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, a nuclear disarmament group, has won the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize. The coalition of grassroots non-government organizations is a decade old and has been awarded the Peace Prize for its efforts towards building a global consensus against atom bomb. Their efforts culminated in the passing of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) in July this year.The treaty, which ‚Äúprohibits the development, testing, production, manufacture, acquisition, possession, stockpiling, transfer, use, and threatened use of nuclear weapons‚Äù will come into effect once it is ratified by 50 member states of the United Nations.‚ÄúThe organization is receiving the award for its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition of such weapons,‚Äù a statement from the Nobel Prize Committee said.The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW), another Nobel Peace Prize-winning organization, during a September 2006 convention in Geneva, Switzerland, decided to adopt a resolution that would finally launch ICAN. One of the motivations behind the formation of ICAN was the visible success of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which was instrumental in negotiating a treaty against anti-personnel land mines. On April 30, 2007, during the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) preparatory committee meeting, ICAN was formally introduced to the world.Since its inception, ICAN has partnered with 468 Non-governmental organization (NGOs) in 101 countries. It has three partner-organizations each in India ‚Äì Indian Doctors for Peace and Development; Indian Institute for Peace, Disarmament and Environmental Protection; and Popular Education and Action Centre ‚Äì and in Pakistan ‚Äì Community Motivation & Development Organization; Pakistan Doctors for Peace and Development; and Alliance for Peace and Disability Rights (APDR).In December 2014, during the Vienna Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons, over 600 ICAN campaigners turned up at the conference and pressured member states to push for a new legal instrument banning nuclear weapons. ICAN called for the ‚Äúlong overdue implementation of the NPT‚Äù. Following ICAN's plea, Austria issued a ‚ÄòHumanitarian Pledge' to work towards filling the ‚Äúlegal gap for the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons.‚ÄùICAN took Austria's pledge forward and spent nearly a year campaigning for it. By November 2015, it managed to get 127 countries around the world to sign the Humanitarian Pledge. Around the same time, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) set up an Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) to look at possible ways of achieving ‚Äúmultilateral disarmament‚Äù. ICAN then campaigned with the OEWG, which eventually recommended to the UNGA to ‚Äúauthorize negotiations‚Äù for elimination of nuclear weapons. It was finally by July 2017 that the TPNW was passed by a 122-1 vote in the UNGA and ICAN's efforts bore fruit.The Nobel Committee statement on Friday said, ‚ÄúWe live in a world where the risk of nuclear weapons being used is greater than it has been for a long time. Some states are modernizing their nuclear arsenals, and there is a real danger that more countries will try to procure nuclear weapons, as exemplified by North Korea.‚ÄùThis award comes at a time when the world is on edge as US President Donald Trump and the North Korean dispensation are in a public spat over the latter's nuclear weapons program. Currently, there are eight nations in the world that possess nuclear weapons. These are the United States of America, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan and North Korea. Israel, too, is believed to possess nuclear weapons, though the middle-eastern nation has not officially declared such. India, Pakistan and North Korea are not signatories to the NPT. India had refused to be a part of it in the 1960s, claiming the NPT regime to be discriminatory. India said it created a world of ‚Äúhaves‚Äù and ‚Äúhave-nots‚Äù. In 2006, after a round of negotiations between then US President George W Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, India decided to separate its civilian and military nuclear programs.
Helen Faye Owens (n√©e Belt), 93, of Maryville, died Friday, Aug. 11, 2017, at Liberty Village in Maryville.
Visitation will be 5-8 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 16, at Irwin Chapel, 591 Glen Crossing Road in Glen Carbon. Services will be at 10 a.m. Thursday, Aug. 17, at the funeral home. Interment will be in Valhalla Gardens of Memory in Belleville.
Hearing Adjourned For Former Auto Shop Employee Jailed For Illicit Photos
April 17, 2017
A Williamston man who allegedly secretly photographed women in the bathroom of a Brighton auto shop where he worked has had his hearing adjourned.
Hearings for 37-year-old Joshua David Porter in 53rd District Court were adjourned twice this month to allow time for review of discovery materials. Porter was charged earlier this month with three counts of capturing/distributing images of an unclothed person and two counts of using a computer to commit a crime. Michigan State Police identify Porter as a Williamston resident, but court records show an Ypsilanti address.
Porter reportedly installed a camera in the women's bathroom at Brighton Auto One where he worked, prior to being transferred to the store's Wixom location. After a photograph was posted to social media, a police raid of the Brighton store was conducted at which time the camera was discovered. Court records indicate the incident took place April 1st of 2016. He is due back in court April 25th. (DK)
In Defence of Animals India (IDA) is rescuing more than 1,000 abused animals every month
IDA India is a non-profit animal protection organisation dedicated to the defence, love and care of animals. Their work includes not just the rescue and rehabilitation of abused domestic animals, but also wildlife. They're also trying to educate the public through campaigns in surrounding towns and awareness talks in schools.
Last month, Disney CEO Bob Iger made some interesting comments about the highly-anticipated Han Solo spin-off, revealing that fans will learn how Han meets his Wookie partner Chewbacca, and that it will follow Han between the years of 18 and 24. The Disney head also dropped quite a big bombshell that has had fans up in arms ever since, revealing that Han Solo isn't actually this smuggler's real name. Thankfully, during Star Wars Celebration this past week, LucasFilm president Kathleen Kennedy said that Han Solo's name will not change.
Ever since Bob Iger made this revelation in late March, some fans have theorized that this Han Solo movie will reveal his real name to be Han Ren, which would explain why his son Ben changed his name to Kylo Ren when he turned to the Dark Side before the events of The Force Awakens. This fan theory has yet to be confirmed, but MTV managed to catch up with LucasFilm President Kathleen Kennedy, who stated that she didn't think Bob Iger meant Han Solo's name will change in this movie, but she did tease there is more to his name.
"I'm not sure that that's entirely what Bob meant. There's more to Han Solo's name, but it's not that it's not his name. It's obviously his name. It will always be his name."
Bob Iger also teased that this movie will show how Han Solo acquired a "certain vehicle," i.e. the Millennium Falcon. Fans learned during the 1980 sequel Empire Strikes Back that Harrison Ford's Han Solo won the ship off of his friend Lando Calrissian, played by Billy Dee Williams, during a game of Sabaac, a popular card game. After Donald Glover was cast as the young Lando, many fans assumed that this game will in fact be played in this spin-off. There has also been speculation that fans could see the Kessell Run, which Han Solo mentions completing in less than 12 parsecs when he first meets Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) in A New Hope.
Another rumor surfaced last month that claimed this adventure will finally showcase Han Solo's home planet of Corellia for the first time. While that report was never confirmed, many speculated that the production's recent shift from the U.K.'s Pinewood Studios to the island of Fuerteventura, one of the Canary Islands, means that this new location will be used for Corellia scenes. The story has been confirmed to be set 10 years before A New Hope, and there have also been rumors that this story may introduce Han Solo's first wife, Sana Solo, but that has yet to be confirmed.
A report from last July claimed that Disney is actually planning a three-part Han Solo trilogy, but that has yet to be confirmed either. Alden Ehrenreich stars as the title character with Donald Glover playing Lando Calrissian, Woody Harrelson playing Han's mentor Garris Shrike, Joonas Suotamo playing Chewbacca and Emilia Clarke, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Thandie Newton and Ian Kenny playing unspecified characters. Take a look at this video interview with Kathleen Kennedy discussing the highly-anticipated Han Solo: A Star Wars Story

What up people! The show that vexes me to no end, The 100 returns to The CW for its 5th outing this week and I have to say the first episode of season 5 made me remember why I used to adore this show. Unfortunately, after the greatness that is episode 1, episode 2 brought me crashing down to earth (see what I did?) and reminded me why the show drives me NUTS. I won't bore you with the Tedious Plot Summary (TPS) because if you are watching S5, you know the characters already. This review is based on the first 4 episodes and contains minor spoilers. The 100 returns to The CW Network, Tuesday, April 24th.
Let's start by what's great ‚Äì the pacing and structure of this season is so much better and more solid than season 3 and 4. The story lines and episodes feel tighter, more focused and less unwieldy than in the past and that's understandable since show creator/writer Jason Rothenberg killed almost his entire cast in the last two years. Only people left are all the people I hated. I'm not going to rehash all the reasons every character on this show was awful.
Rothenberg does something I thought was impossible, he made me like Clarke (Eliza Taylor) again and hell I even like Bellamy (Bob Morley) now. Although it is still hard to fully invest in his character after the events of S3. If this was S2 Bellamy, I'd totally be in love with S5 Bellamy. He's grown up and is now someone who thinks before he acts, doesn't shoot first before knowing all the facts and has finally gotten rid of the chip on his shoulder and is acting his age and thinks strategically.
Bellamy only had to go on a self-righteous, self-serving, xenophobic, murderous rampage and kill over 300 innocent people for him to get to this point, but, whatever. Clarke and everyone else forgave him, even though he never once admitted that what he did was wrong. Grounder lives don't matter. Don't get me started. Anyway, I like this version of Bellamy, I still will probably throw my controller at my expensive OLED TV when this inevitably happens.
Morley does an amazing job with this version of Bellamy, he gives the character a lot of layers, while I say his redemption wasn't earned, you can tell his actions weighed on him just by the way he carries himself now and the subtle looks he gives everyone.
Back to my original point about the pacing. Each of the first four episodes focus tightly on just a few storylines. Episode 1 is mostly Clarke's journey alone on earth and we find out what she's been up to and how she spent 6 years as the only living person on earth. There's a whole Castaway vibe to how the episode is structured and Eliza Taylor really knocks it out of the park, dare I say this was Emmy level acting and writing? It really was one of the best single hours of TV I've seen all year.
During her walkabout, Clarke meets the only other living human during her first few months alone. Even as a small girl, Madi (Lola Flanery) was feisty and kicked Clarke's butt. The show does a great job of using only two scenes to get me hooked on Madi and by the end of the episode I thought she was a great addition to the show. Can't wait to see where the character goes.
The last 15 minutes of episode one focuses us on the what's happening with Bellamy and the others up on the arc. There's really not much to say, other than, I really hated what they did with Murphy. They basically threw away most of Murphy's character growth to return him back to a modified version of S1 douchebag Murphy. It really annoyed me because Murphy is the only character on this show who actually had a full character arc and changed for the better. Everyone else is pretty much exactly the same as they were in S1.
The nice thing about the time jump is they no longer need to act and look like they are teenagers and are able to act their ages, and while I do say these characters haven't really changes since s1, they all are definitely more world weary, but Murphy, he went on a true character journey and came out a better man because of it.
Bellamy has gone on that same type of journey, but his redemption and change hasn't been earned. I feel like I get whiplash whenever I watch Bellamy. His character changes based on whatever the plot needs. So while I like Bellamy now, I won't be surprised if he goes on another rampage.
MAJOR SPOILERS FOR EPISODE 2
After the greatness that was Episode 1, we're hit with Episode 2 which focuses on things happening in the bunker and everything that I loathe about this show. We have the last remaining humans on earth and instead of trying to find a way to live together they are still fighting and killing each other and Octavia (Marie Avgeropoulos) went from being one of my favorite charcters on TV to having all her potential completely wiped out. She's a one note character, all she does is sit on her high horse and judge everyone else around her and acts like she's a perfect human being.
Now that she's leader of the entire human race ‚Äì supposedly, she once again does absolutely nothing in this episode to make things better. To strive to be better, to get her people to act better. No, the entire episode is basically cage fight after cage fight with Octavia and her horribly cheap, looking face paint standing judgement. The episode lost me in the very beginning when Skaikru still holding grudges decides to take over the bunker. Of course, the people who end up getting slaughtered by Octavia for Skaikru actions are the grounders.
I understand you need to do something to get these people to cooperate, but I'm sorry it's the end of the freaking world and the only thing the writers could think to do was have a Conclave at the end of season 4 and essentially keep them fighting throughout 6 years trapped in a bunker? The show is so focused on showing grounders as only one thing and it's just tired and irritating now.
I really hoped they would show everyone as using this as an opportunity to evolve and they would come out of the bunker fully unified and ready to not repeat the same mistakes of the past. Kane and Abby are basically useless in this episode and I won't spoil what happens to them in later episode 4 but none of it makes a lick of sense. Anytime Indra is the only reasonable, sane person you know there's trouble.
Episode 3 puts the new mystery people from Prison Station in the spotlight. The entire episode was basically designed to put Clarke in the shoes of the grounders, namely Lincoln and some of the scenes feel like they were lifted straight from S1. She doesn't know who these strangers are and is scouting them.
It turns out the Prisoners were cryogenically frozen and sent into space before the world ended. So they are over 100 years old. Their leader Diyoza (Ivana Milicevic) is a reasonable, but hard ass ex-navy seal who turned into a terrorist. She's kind of an older version of Clarke, she's not someone who wants to just kill everything in sight, but she's also all about eliminating any potential threat. There are a couple of really intriguing twists here in this episode that I don't want to spoil.
I do think these Prison station people are a red herring and that there will be something bigger than this fight to deal with. I have no idea what that can be since the entire world has literally been wiped out. I believe the show is going to end with most of them being back on the Ark. Similar to how Gilligan's Island end with them back on the Island.
Without delving too deeply into Ep 3 here, it was a pretty solid return to form after the mess of Ep 2. Believe me there's more that happens but I don't want to spoil. Imagine how much greater this season could have been if they didn't have S3 and S4 and there was actually peace between the grounders and skycrew and then Prison station landed. Overall, I really love the first 4 episodes of this, it starts strong but I think Octavia and the bunker crew are going to drag this season down.

Clemson wins third-straight, tops Wake Forest
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. ‚Äî A 12-3 run to end the game helped seal Clemson University men's basketball's road victory at Wake Forest, 75-67, on Saturday afternoon.
The Tigers (19-4, 8-3 ACC) were led by Gabe DeVoe who stayed hot with 24 points on 8-for-11 shooting, including 5-for-7 from long range. DeVoe's long range sniping has now contributed to a Tigers team that has made at least 10 3-point field goals in three consecutive games for the first time since 1983.
Marcquise Reed finished with 18 of his 22 total points in the second half, including six free throws in the last 3:39 of regulation. Reed also shared the rebounding lead with Elijah Thomas, adding seven boards.
Shelton Mitchell added in 10 points and five boards in the effort.
After taking a 35-30 lead into the locker room, DeVoe began the second half hitting three free throws after being fouled in the act of shooting. It opened up Clemson's largest lead of the game to that point at eight.
From the 18:02 mark until 14:45 left in the game, the Demon Deacons (9-14, 2-9 ACC) went on an 11-0 run to reclaim an advantage at 44-41.
With the Tigers trailing 61-58 and 7:08 left in the game, Clemson went on a small 7-3 run sparked by a DeVoe three and a Reed layup. In the last four minutes of the game, the Tigers shot 10-for-11 at the foul line in the waning moments of the game to help seal the victory.
Clemson returns the court on Thursday, Feb. 8 at 7 p.m. when it hosts Pittsburgh.
Notes: The win improves Clemson to 8-3 in the ACC for the first time since 1996-97 ‚Ä¶ also with the win and Duke's loss on Saturday to St. John's ‚Äì the Tigers own sole possession of second place in the ACC ‚Ä¶ as it currently stands, Clemson would own the largest preseason to postseason ranking differential in ACC history of +11 (Clemson was picked to finish 13th in the preseason) ‚Ä¶ Clemson has now made at least 10 3-point field goals in three consecutive games for the first time since 1983 ‚Ä¶ Gabe DeVoe has been lights out this week and that continued with a game-high 24 points shooting 8-for-11 from the field and 5-for-7 from distance ‚Ä¶ for the week, DeVoe has shot 24-of-38 from the field and 15-of-23 from three ‚Ä¶ his 24 points is the second-highest total of the season for the senior ‚Ä¶ Reed poured in 22 points ‚Äì his seventh 20-point game of the season.

Morgan Freeman‚Äòs lawyer has asked CNN to retract a report from last week which claimed Morgan Freeman, a celebrated actor, sexually harassed eight women.
Robert M. Schwartz, Freeman's lawyer, sent a letter to CNN president Jeff Zucker, calling the story false and demanded the network apologize to the actor over the accusations, Variety reports.
The 80-year-old actor has denied the claims since the CNN report was published on May 24. The outlet interviewed 16 people‚Äìeight of which corroborated claims of sexual harassment.
RELATED: Morgan Freeman Responds To Misconduct Allegations In A Second Statement: ‚ÄòI Did Not Assault These Women'
One of the reporters who wrote the story, Chloe Melas, claimed that during a press round for the 2015 film ‚ÄúGoing In Style,‚Äù Freeman called her ‚Äúripe‚Äù and made her feel uncomfortable. At the time she was six months pregnant.
In the letter to Zucker, Schwartz writes that Melas ‚Äúbaited and prodded‚Äù witnesses and alleged victims to come forward because she had a personal vendetta against the actor. Schwartz also points to an internal report conducted by Warner Bros. which found no wrongdoing on Freeman's part. Melas was the only victim who was explicitly named in the CNN story, but Schwartz says that another witness, Chicago WGN-TV's, Tyra Martin, says the outlet misquoted her account with Freeman.
‚ÄúThe problem with Ms. Melas' account, which infected everything that she and CNN thereafter did, is that her version of the interview is false,‚Äù Schwartz's statement reads. ‚ÄúIt is based on her imagining that Mr. Freeman had said or done anything to harass her. However, there is substantial evidence that Ms. Melas imagined an incident, or exaggerated a non-malicious remark wildly out of proportion to reality, to give her a basis to go after Mr. Freeman and cause him the grave harm that CNN's story has inflicted.‚Äù
CNN has refused to retract the story, saying that it stands by its journalist standards of reporting.
‚ÄúThe unfounded accusations made by Mr. Freeman's lawyer are disappointing and are difficult to reconcile with Mr. Freeman's own public statements in the aftermath of the story,‚Äù the statement reads. ‚ÄúCNN stands by its reporting and will respond forcefully to any attempt by Mr. Freeman or his representatives to intimidate us from covering this important public issue.‚Äù
Since the story broke, Freeman has lost multiple endorsements, including a marketing campaign with Visa and a possible revoking of his SAG-AFTRA lifetime achievement award.

In a unanimous decision, Judges of the Court of Appeal of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court has upheld a decision by Justice Errol Thomas and dismissed the appeal of Abel ‚ÄúChecko‚Äù Jno Baptiste in a defamation lawsuit which was filed by Dr. Philbert Aaron.
This means that Calypsonian ‚ÄòChecko' has to pay $130,000 in damages to Aaron.
The matter goes back to 2011 when ‚ÄòChecko' penned a calypso called ‚ÄúBug Her‚Äù and Aaron sued him for defamation in 2013 but he failed to file a defense.
Judgment in default was entered and the court awarded general damages in the amount of $75,000.00 for slander contained in the song published by the defendant during the period December 2011 to the first week in March 2012 in the calypso tent, on radio, at the semi-final and final calypso shows and on the road during carnival.
For aggravated damages, Dr. Aaron was awarded the sum of $50,000.00 and a further $5,000.00 for exemplary damages on account of the re-mix of the song because of ‚ÄòChecko's' desire to win the road March title.
The total was $130,000.
In court on Tuesday, Checko's lawyer Singolla B Williams argued that her client has accepted that the allegations made were ‚Äúserious‚Äù but the amount awarded were ‚Äúway off the scale compared to others and excessive in the circumstances.‚Äù
She told the court her client had ‚Äúapologized‚Äù and ought to have been given some ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù.
But the Appeals Court Judges, Paul Webster, Gertal Thom and Louise Blenman said that the accusations made by ‚ÄòChecko' were ‚Äúserious and very aggravating‚Äù.
Williams countered and told the court that the matter had to do with a mere ‚Äúcalypso‚Äù which was part of Dominica's culture and her client had tried his best to mask it, but had done a poor job at it.
The Judges were not amused stating that, ‚Äúwe don't want to give people the license that because it is calypso they can defame people.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe is a married man and a prominent person in society,‚Äù the Judges said of Dr. Aaron. ‚ÄúDominicans feel strongly against buggery, people have gotten killed‚Ä¶ we have reviewed the submissions and authorities and have found no legal basis in law to interfere with the decision of the learned trial Judge, accordingly the appeal is dismissed and the decision of the trial Judge is affirmed.‚Äù
Dr. Aaron said he felt ‚Äúvindicated.‚Äù
‚ÄúI feel vindicated and it's a message to calypso and all communicators: do not make allegations for which you cannot provide evidence,‚Äù he said.
He called on those writing calypso to know that they don't have the unfettered right to defame and slander people.
‚ÄúReputation that has been built with hard work and expending of monies showed, not be stolen, and snatched with impunity‚Ä¶I hope every member of society takes note,‚Äù Dr. Aaron said.

The final table leaves Thatcham in fourth place, 16 points behind champions and Southern League-bound Thame United.
It's one of the most all-consuming questions ever asked in American politics, a tried and true part of any investigation of what could be a serious scandal.
Who knew what? And when?
Good morning from the state capital. I'm Sacramento Bureau Chief John Myers, and we begin with the intense fight over what happens now that retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn has stepped aside as President Trump's national security advisor.
OUT LIKE FLYNN
Monday night's sudden and surprising resignation by Flynn (or was it a firing?) came just 24 days into Trump's presidency. And it's likely to cause ripples that last for weeks or months.
After several days of damaging accusations about his post-election conversations with Russia's ambassador, Flynn's departure may temporarily stop the political bleeding. But it does nothing to stop more worrisome questions about Moscow's meddling in the U.S. elections, and whether Trump will be able to stay on course with his stated goal of improving relations between the two countries.
TRUMP KNEW FOR THREE WEEKS
Back to those key questions, though, memorialized by the Watergate scandal of 1973 and 1974: What did (insert the name of prominent person here) know, and when did he or she know it?
The White House said Tuesday that the president knew about the concerns over Flynn's Russian communiqu√©s for three weeks and that Trump had been ‚Äúevaluating‚Äù the situation.
Consider, too, some other notable nuggets offered on Tuesday by Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. First, he said Trump asked for the resignation ‚Äî a distinction from early reports that Flynn simply offered it.
And perhaps more important, Spicer sought to portray the entire episode as not ‚Äúa legal issue, but a trust issue.‚Äù
Not that Democrats are buying that.
DEMOCRATS DEMAND ANSWERS
Democrats demanded on Tuesday a full investigation of Flynn's dealings with Russian leaders. They want an independent review of the situation.
‚ÄúGen. Flynn's resignation is not the end of the story, it is merely the beginning,‚Äù said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.)
Republicans, meanwhile, were less than unanimous in their reactions to what should happen next. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (D-Wisc.) said he would ‚Äúleave it up to the administration‚Äù to determine what happens next. And two prominent California congressmen, from different parties, are also sparring about the next steps.
Are there other shoes to drop? How does the president react to what will certainly be a drumbeat of Democratic calls for a deeper dive into alleged deception? We'll keep on top of all of this on our Essential Washington daily news feed.
And while you ponder what's next, check out our timeline of the events in the Flynn saga.
A LEADER IN IRAQ, NOW AT THE PRESIDENT'S SIDE
Trump tapped retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg to fill Flynn's boots for now. And the solider has a fascinating backstory, having served as chief of staff to L. Paul Bremer when Bremer led the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq after the 2003 war.
‚ÄúI'm the guy who's supposed to make the trains run on time,‚Äù said Kellogg at the time, the focus of a 2003 profile in The Times.
IN OTHER TRUMP HEADLINES‚Ä¶
A stinging rebuke was issued Tuesday to Kellyanne Conway, the president's senior counselor, for her comments last week that seemed to offer free advertising for Ivanka Trump's clothing and jewelry line.
The Office of Government Ethics said it looked as though Conway's comments crossed the line.
On the other hand, Tuesday saw success for the president's choice to lead the Small Business Administration. Linda McMahon was overwhelmingly confirmed by the Senate. She is a former wrestling and entertainment executive who twice ran unsuccessful campaigns for the U.S. Senate.
NO EASY PATH FORWARD ON OBAMACARE
One of the biggest policy debates of 2017, from Washington to here in Sacramento, is what's next for Republican promises to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.
Two notable markers became clear in the last couple of days. First, new data shows the ranks of the uninsured have dropped to the lowest level ever recorded ‚Äî just 8.8%. That's a lot of newly insured Americans who have a stake in what's crafted to replace Obamacare.
But bad news, too, for some Obamacare recipients: Humana, one of the nation's largest health insurers, announced on Tuesday that it's leaving the 2010 law's exchanges in 2018. That prompted a tweet from Trump that proclaimed the news as evidence of Obamacare's failure.
ROLLING BACK REGULATIONS
Congressional Republican leaders are churning out a steady stream of bills designed, in part, to undo President Obama's regulatory agenda.
The list includes coal mining rules and U.S. corporate disclosure regulations.
‚ÄúWith President Trump's signature, every one of these regulations will be overturned,‚Äù said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield).

CALIFORNIA GETS HELP, BROWN DOWNPLAYS THE FIGHT
Taking the historic step, the Supreme Court on Monday ordered the installation of CCTV cameras in all states and union territories to record proceedings in trial courts and tribunals across the country."Installation of CCTV cameras is useful to achieve objective of transparent judicial system," said a bench of Justices Adarsh K Goel and Uday U Lalit.The Court observed it was time that every word uttered during the proceedings should be recorded."We are a court of records. Every word should be recorded. We don't see any problem with this," remarked the bench, as it asked all 24 high courts to initiate the process of installing CCTV cameras inside courtrooms and also in the court precincts.The Court, which had in March started the exercise on a trial basis, gave its go ahead to expand it to courts as well as tribunals in the country. While only video recording was to be done in pursuant to the previous order, the bench on Monday said audio will also be recorded henceforth.The Court asked high courts to devise modalities and complete the exercise as soon as possible. It gave one month to the Union Ministry of Information Technology and Department of Justice to come up with standards of technical specifications and pricing of these CCTV cameras."We however make it clear nobody will record the proceedings without authorisation from the high court concerned," said the bench.It added that third party will not be given such recordings and that these recordings will be deleted after a specific time period.The judicial order on cameras inside courtrooms has come following several rounds of deliberations between the Central government and the top judiciary on the issue of audio-video recording of court proceedings.Since August 2013, Union Law Ministers have written to the then Chief Justices of India at least thrice to consider recording the court proceedings in the interest of transparency and better case management.But the Supreme Court judges demonstrated reluctance with the latest communication in August 2016 telling the government that the judges felt a ‚Äúwider consultation‚Äù was necessary before a final decision could be made. Not just this, many PILs demanding audio-video recording of proceedings were being dismissed in the past even though Law Commissions have made recommendations favouring audio-video recording.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders gets picked on a lot as President Donald Trump's White House press secretary, but there's no argument that her job is a tough one. And the state of the socio-political climate might actually be getting to her too these days. On Wednesday, a 13-year-old kid's question about school shootings made Sarah Huckabee Sanders tear up as she gave her response, in a very rare show of emotion. Twitter, which is used to watching her on the defense as she takes questions from the podium, was understandably in awe of this new side of our country's spokesperson.
Benje Choucroun, a 13-year-old with Time for Kids was in the briefing room on Wednesday and told her that he was scared to be shot at school, as The Hill reported. The budding journalist then asked her what the administration is doing, or plans to do, to make schools safer for children. It was a very timely, telling question.
Sanders responded, according to video of the briefing, "I think that as a kid and certainly as a parent there is nothing that could be more terrifying for a kid to go to school and not feel safe." On social media, people were debating whether those were tears she was fighting back or if she just has allergies.
Her voice trembled a little bit as she continued, "So I'm sorry that you feel that way.‚Äù She then added that the president "takes it very seriously" and had a school safety commission meeting this week to "discuss the best ways forward and how we can do every single thing within our power to protect kids in our schools."
According to The New York Times, that commission is led by Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and it hasn't really done all that much yet. After the Parkland, Florida school shooting Trump seemed to be getting involved and suggested arming teachers as a solution to school gun violence and looking into getting stricter background checks for people who buy guns. He also suggested raising the minimum age to buy a gun but later tweeted that there was no political support for that, as reported by The Denver Post.
All of the inaction on taking meaningful steps towards preventing senseless gun violence and Sanders response to the 13-year-old had Twitter legitimately shook.
They Saw Another Side Of Her, Sort Of
Choucroun told People after the briefing that he was pretty nervous to ask a question. He said, "because I knew that these press conferences were a big deal and Sarah Huckabee Sanders is a big deal.‚Äù He added that he was "surprised" that the press secretary got choked up but that he was glad he drew attention to the issues. Choucroun added:
I'm glad I did it because school shootings, as we saw in Santa Fe, are something that needs to be stopped. And I'm happy that I raised awareness to the issue.
Fox News on YouTube
Since the Parkland, Florida shooting, there have been two other school shootings, in Texas and in Indiana, along with the March for Our Lives, led by student activists for gun safety, but not a whole lot of actual work to change some of the rules surrounding gun ownership.
On social media, some were quick to note that getting emotional is akin to sending thoughts and prayers after shootings instead of taking real action, such as redefining how we define and disarm domestic abusers, pushing for universal background checks, or passing Red Flag Laws in states to give law enforcement some more preventative power.
Hopefully, kids like Choucroun, parents, and legislators will keep pushing for some change when it comes to gun violence prevention. Even if we all feel like crying about the scary and sad state of the gun policy debate, there's a lot more work to be done.

Noblesville West Middle School science teacher Jason Seaman is greeted by his students, over a fence, at the IHSAA baseball championships, the Noblesville vs Hamilton Southeastern game, Monday, May 28, 2018. This is the first time his students have seen him since Friday May 25's school shooting. When a student opened fire in the seventh grade science classroom, Seaman intervened to stop the shooter from shooting more students. He and one student were shot in the incident. He was shot three times. He told the students he couldn't hug them just yet, because he was still a little tender, but he could high five them.

NOBLESVILLE, Indiana ‚Äî When Jackson Ramey saw the scab-like wound near Jason Seaman's elbow he found it almost funny.
It was caused by a bullet, the Noblesville High School senior said, but it looked more like a scrape a kid would get from falling off a bike.
That shows how tough this guy is, Ramey said.
Before the shooting, Ramey, like most of the country, had no idea who Seaman was. He went to Noblesville West Middle School, but never had him as a teacher.

Then Friday morning the seventh grade science teacher was shot three times, according to family members, while intervening after a student opened fire in his classroom injuring Seaman and a student.
Suddenly to Ramey, again like most of the country, Seaman was a hero. And Ramey wanted to do something.
"I was like, 'I feel so helpless right now I need to do something to help him out,'" Ramey said.
At 3 p.m Friday he started trying to set up a GoFundMe. It took until around 6:30 p.m. to post. Ramey had to reach out to the school board and prove he had a way to get any money raised to Seaman, his wife and their two young kids.
The first goal was $4,000. They hit that within the first few doners.
By the time he went to sleep Ramey changed the goal to $10,000. It exceeded that by the time he woke up Saturday.

Ramey organized the GoFundMe page for Seaman that has raised over $70,000! #WAT pic.twitter.com/M9Q1ZFEUwH ‚Äî The Noblesville Millers (@MillerNationAD) May 28, 2018
By Wednesday, as Noblesville West Middle School students headed back to school, many for the first time since the shooting, the goal was $100,000. At 1 p.m. it had raised more than $97,000. A separate GoFundMe for Ella Whistler, the 13-year-old student who was critically injured in the shooting, has raised more than $54,000.
Ramey never expected that. Getting $20,000? That was fathomable. Not this.
Seaman couldn't believe it either.
"I can't really fathom how someone I have not personally met would do such an act of kindness," he said during a press conference Monday, "And how the Noblesville community has been so generous in their response to it."
The fund for Whistler was started by Katie Benosky. She declined to comment, but appears to work with Ella's father, according to the company website.
Ramey was in class at the high school when he first heard about the shooting from his girlfriend. Her little sister was in the middle school.

"These are just seventh graders," Ramey said. "If the student got past him...He was the first and last line of defense. If he were to get past him who knows what could have happened."
On Monday, Ramey got his chance to meet Seaman. He's a baseball player, and helped his team win the IHSAA championship playoff game. The district considered moving the game, then decided instead to turn it into an opportunity for the community to pull together and honor Seaman and Whistler.
Ramey was called over afterwards. He shook Seamans hand. Gave him a hug. Seaman wasn't wearing any obvious bandages or slings.
"He said the monetary value does not matter, and that kind of took me back," Ramey said.
What mattered to Seaman, Ramey said, was that he had given the community something to rally behind, a way to express hope.
"That really just speaks levels of his character," Ramey said.
Afterward, Seaman tweeted his thanks to Ramey, calling him an "incredible young man."
"It was an honor to meet you," Seaman said. "Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
Jackson, you are an incredible young man. It was an honor to meet you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. https://t.co/V8w8o1Tb1p ‚Äî Jason Seaman (@SeamanNWMS) May 28, 2018
As for Ramey, he just keeps repeating he wanted to help.
"It was to pay back a deed that can't be repaid," he said. "Because what he did cannot be repaid."

LANSING, Mich. (AP) ‚Äî A government panel is scheduled for a briefing on a recent agreement between Michigan officials and the company that operates twin oil pipelines in the Straits of Mackinac.
The Michigan Pipeline Safety Advisory Board will discuss the deal during its quarterly meeting Monday in Lansing. It calls for the state and Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge Inc. to decide the future of Line 5 by Aug. 15.
Line 5 carries 23 million gallons daily between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario. Long-term options include placing the lines in an underground tunnel or shutting them down.
Enbridge officials also will update the advisory board on recently discovered gaps in the pipelines' protective coating.
Environmental groups plan to use a public comment period to continue their push for decommissioning Line 5.

Six dead in Montreal as much of Canada remains under blanket of hot, humid air

Montreal health officials are blaming the heavy heat and humidity for at least six deaths in recent days.
Dr. Mylene Drouin told a news conference today the deaths have been investigated and are linked directly to the heat wave.
Drouin says the victims fit the profile of people authorities describe as at risk: those with chronic illness or mental-health problems, people who live alone and people without air conditioning at home.
She says there has also been a rise in the number of calls to ambulance services in recent days and that the city wants to avoid what happened in 2010, when intense heat claimed 106 lives.
In the Eastern Townships region southeast of Montreal, four deaths are under investigation to determine if they are related to the extreme heat. Authorities were expected to provide more details on Wednesday morning.
The oppressive weather has enveloped much of Central and Eastern Canada since the Canada Day long weekend.
Environment Canada says humidex readings were to be in the 40 Celsius range today from southwestern and northeastern Ontario through southern Quebec and into the Atlantic region.

The weather agency says a ‚Äúvery warm and humid air mass‚Äù has settled over the Maritimes and above normal temperatures and humid conditions will stick around into Thursday. Maritime temperatures are expected to return to seasonal normals for the weekend.
A hot and humid air mass is also entrenched over southern Quebec, with Tuesday's highs expected to be in the low 30s with a humidex reading between 35 and 40 C, also through Thursday.
Southern Quebec was rocked by violent storms on Monday, leaving thousands of homes and businesses without electricity, or air conditioning. Most of the outages were in the Outaouais region of western Quebec in addition to areas north and northeast of Montreal.
Environment Canada said much of southern Ontario, including Toronto, also remains under a heat warning, with a humidex reading of 43 expected on Tuesday. The extreme heat was expected to ease off on Friday with the passage of a cold front.
In western Alberta, meanwhile, the problem is rain and lots of it.
As of late Monday, about 30 millimetres of rain had fallen in the Jasper region, creating the possibility of flooding in low-lying areas. Environment Canada said another 25 to 50 millimetres of rain were expected before it tapers off Wednesday morning.

Sergio Cabral, former governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, has been sentenced to 14 years in prison on corruption and money laundering charges and is the latest in the ongoing saga of politcal scandals across Brazil that might feel very familiar to Americans.
Cabral served two terms as governor of Rio de Janeiro from 2007 to 2014. Cabral and his right hand man in the state's interior department Wilson Carlo Carvalho were convicted on charges of corruption after it was proven that they recieved bribes from private construction firms in exchange for awarding them pricey government contracts.
His arrest was just one of many investigations into government corruption dubbed "Operation Car Wash" that is sending shockwaves through the halls of Brazilian government at the state and national levels. Former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff was removed from office in August 2016 amidst allegations of giving kick backs to her former employers at state-run oil company Petrobras.

Rousseff's running mate and current President Michel Temer is currently feeling the heat from the judiciary investigations into corruption. Although Temer is personally not under investigation, almost a third of his administration is. Temer is also denying the existence of a recording of him allegedly bribing a jailed official for his silence in upcoming investigations. Does any of this sound familiar?
The political and economic climates in Brazil haven't been looking good and don't seem to be clearing up soon. Rousseff's predecessor former President Lula da Silva will stand trial on corruption charges. Thousands of angry demonstrators marched to Congress in the capital of Brasilia to protest economic reforms that President Temer is endorsing and to demand his resignation amidst a storm of corruption and pay-for-play charges.
Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi is beginning to wind down it's epic box office run, which means that he's able to talk more openly about the decisions that he made while making the movie, since nearly everybody has seen it. Many of the director's decisions have been savagely picked apart by Star Wars fans. One of the more controversial decisions in The Last Jedi was the way that Supreme Leader Snoke was portrayed, but now, Johnson is giving some insight into a key scene that left many fans shocked. There are SPOILERS for The Last Jedi ahead, read at your own risk.
Rian Johnson spoke about the controversial Snoke scene in a new Q&A where he revealed Kylo Ren's state of mind during the scene. The director has spoken at great length about why he did not delve more into Snoke's backstory and insists that the movie is supposed to be based around the characters of Kylo Ren and Rey, and Snoke was a plot device to get a particular point across about Kylo Ren. Ultimately, Kylo is able to kill Snoke, but when did he decide to do it?
Rian Johnson revealed that Kylo Ren knew beforehand that he was going to betray Snoke, but he didn't know the exact time that it would happen. It wasn't until he brought Rey up to Snoke that he knew that it was time, but he still didn't know how it was going to go down. Johnson explains.
"In my mind, he walks in there knowing basically that he is going to betray Snoke but he doesn't know yet exactly what the mechanism is and what his opportunity is going to be. But he's gone in there with the intent of, whether it's now or whether it's later or whenever it is, when he brings Rey in there, he's had that connection with her and what he says in the elevator... from that, in my head I thought, Okay, he knows he's going to do this but he doesn't know how yet and when he sees that opportunity with that lightsaber next to him and sees Snoke distracted and realizes he can give this an attempt, he goes for it."
Throughout The Last Jedi we see Kylo Ren's conflicts in his head about who he's supposed to be. We finally see him trash his superficial homage to Darth Vader and begin to come into his own, which means that Snoke had to go.
Now that we know what was going through Kylo Ren's head, it's safe to say that he never considered joining the Resistance. It's at this point that his thirst for power has only started to be fulfilled, it's a time where he can see himself as Darth Vader powerful. It's going to be really interesting to see how J.J. Abrams addresses the quest for power in Star Wars 9 because Rian Johnson set him up to go down a pretty dark path, which is really saying something since he killed his dad in The Force Awakens.
While Rian Johnson was quick to share Kylo Ren's thoughts during the Snoke scene, he was not as open when asked about the end of the movie where he's shown on Crait with Han Solo's holographic dice when the Millennium Falcon speeds away. That scene is open to our interpretation, but it could be some regret after being beaten by his uncle in hologram form, regret that turns into even more anger and rage. You can check out the rest of what Rian Johnson had to say about The Last Jedi via Sleemo's Tumblr.
PANAJI: With the end of the extended deadline on January 23, 2017, the state revenue department has received 3,889 applications from across the state under the Goa Regularisation of Unauthorised Construction Act, 2016 to regularise structures built on private land.
The applications received will now be scrutinised by way of physical inspection by the nodal officers.
As per information received by this daily from the revenue department, 1,929 applications have been received from north Goa and 1,960 applications from south Goa. When contacted, Under Secretary of revenue department Ashutosh Apte said that the Deputy Collectors and sub-divisional officers are the nodal officers, who have received these applications from their respective jurisdictions. He said that the government has constituted special teams, which will carry out the further procedure of scrutinising the applications followed by physical inspection of the said unauthorised structures built on private land.
In order to give relief to many Goan families which were living in such residential structures besides those that had constructed institutions and residential cum commercial structures before February 28, 2014, the state government enacted the law in August 2016.
According to the law, the owners will have to pay all conversion fees, infrastructure tax, occupancy fees plus the construction licence fee, besides a penalty. The penalty would be five per cent for residential and institutional structures, 15 per cent for commercial and ten per cent for residential cum commercial structures.
Structures to be covered include any construction in one's own property, construction in a property held by co-owners (provided necessary written consent of such co-owner has been obtained), construction of mundkarial structure by a person duly declared as mundkar under the provisions of the Mundkar Act, or a farmhouse constructed by a tenant or owner on agriculture land.
Also, any structure on undivided property held jointly by a unit of family or families, provided consent of every such member of the family is annexed will be covered under the new law.
The proposed legislation will not hold good if the structure to be regularised is situated in a protected forest area, within a wildlife sanctuary, in areas covered under coastal regulation zone 2011, no-development zone, open space, public land, structures in or for scrapyard, eco-sensitive zone notified by the Union Environment Ministry, khazan land or has been built by obstructing any natural water channel or by filling up of water bodies.
An official said that though the applications have been received by the authorities, the actual exercise would be carried out after the end of assembly election process, as all the Deputy Collectors are returning officers for the election.

Four months after a Falcon 9 rocket exploded on a Florida launch pad, SpaceX has determined that the cause was a failed composite overwrapped pressure vessel used to store liquid helium.
In the final update to its investigation released Monday, the Hawthorne space company said one of three such tanks in the rocket's larger, second-stage liquid oxygen tank failed, probably after a buildup of liquid oxygen between the vessel's aluminum inner liner and its carbon overwrap ignited.
In November, SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk described the cause of the explosion as something that has ‚Äúnever been encountered before in the history of rocketry.‚Äù
The company said its accident investigation team ‚Äî made up of officials from SpaceX, NASA, the National Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. Air Force, the Federal Aviation Administration and industry experts ‚Äî found ‚Äúbuckles,‚Äù or valleys, in the vessels' inner liners.
Super-chilled liquid oxygen can gather in buckles, and when pressurized, the oxygen can get trapped. Then, ‚Äúbreaking fibers or friction can ignite the oxygen in the overwrap,‚Äù causing the vessel to fail, SpaceX said.
The company also said the loading temperature of the helium was cold enough to create solid oxygen, ‚Äúwhich exacerbates the possibility of oxygen becoming trapped as well as the likelihood of friction ignition.‚Äù
To fix this issue in the short term, SpaceX said it will change the configuration of the composite overwrapped pressure vessels ‚Äúto allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded.‚Äù It will also change helium loading operations to a ‚Äúprior flight proven configuration‚Äù that is based on procedures that were used in hundreds of successful loads.
SpaceX plans to eventually change the design of the vessels to prevent buckles, which the company said will allow for faster loading operations.
The company is now targeting Jan. 8 for its return to flight, pending FAA approval. SpaceX plans to launch 10 satellites for Iridium Communications Inc. from Vandenberg Air Force Base.

Perhaps the most remarkable aspect is that at any given moment in songs such as ‚ÄúJust a Closer Walk With Thee‚Äù or ‚ÄúSt. James Infirmary,‚Äù the central melody may or may not be evident, yet the song's guiding principle keeps the players unified no matter how far afield each may get in his or her own interpretation of that melody.
PORTLAND, Ore. -- The National Weather Service has issued a Red Flag Warning for the Fourth of July in parts of the Portland metro area and western Columbia River Gorge.
The warning means a fire could expand rapidly in affected areas because of wind and low humidity.
It began at 1 p.m. and ends at 8 p.m. Affected areas include parts of Multnomah, Clackamas, Clark, Skamania, and Hood River counties. The warning extends as far east as Cascade Locks, west to Portland, north to Battle Ground and south to West Linn.
Clark County fire officials also said Southwest Washington residents should be aware of "extremely high wildfire danger" today, and asked residents to be cautious with fireworks.
"Aerial devices, in particular, can behave unpredictably in the forecast high winds of up to 35 mph," said Camas-Washougal Fire Chief Nick Swinhart. "A small vegetation fire can quickly grow out of control before fire department crews can arrive."

Winds are expected to reach 10 to 20 mph blowing from the east and northeast. Gusts could reach 30 to 35 mph.
The NWS says people enjoying the holiday should be careful with anything that could ignite a fire, especially in grassy areas. Outdoor burning is not recommended.
Fire officials suggested residents who use fireworks have a garden hose or fire extinguisher nearby.

Lt. Governor Brian Calley recently introduced a proposal to make Michigan's Legislature part-time that threatens representative government, McNeilly writes. (Photo: John M. Galloway / Detroit News)
Statewide officials have been clashing over the misguided notion of a ‚Äúpart-time legislature.‚Äù
Both Lt. Gov. Brian Calley and Attorney General Bill Schuette have voiced support of this idea. Both are wrong. However, Calley makes it worse by proposing a specific proposal that will bring glee ‚Äî if adopted ‚Äî to the bank accounts of lobbyists, consultants and professional politicians alike.
A part-time legislature is a great idea ‚Äî if you hate a representative republic.
The proposed scheme specifically limits the legislature to three months of consecutive work each year and cuts legislators' salaries in half. According to its pushers, savings could reach ‚Äútens of millions‚Äù of dollars, so that would mean slashing legislative staff as well, leaving offices shuttered, phones unanswered, and constituent concerns unheard.
The move would make Michigan the only state in the United States with such restrictive term limits and a part-time legislature. There are a host of good reasons no other state does what supporters have proposed. Attracting talented women and men willing ‚Äî and able ‚Äî to serve is near the top of the list.
While term limits have made it more difficult to truly attract the best and brightest, it's still true that just about anyone can serve in the Michigan legislature and represent the needs and interests of his or her hometown, county and district. That's because it's a full-time job with a fair bit of certainty (at least for two years).
Most Michiganians would be hard pressed to find a job or career that offers up three consecutive months of vacation each year. More likely, legislative work would quickly become a more exclusive realm of the independently wealthy, while working-class men and women looking to serve would face a decision over whether or not to give-up long-term employment for a few exciting weeks in Lansing.
Perhaps more troubling, individuals who do find a way to maintain their employment may be confronted with very real and very serious conflicts of interest that challenge their integrity and threaten their livelihood.
Just this month in West Virginia, a state with a part-time legislature, the leader of the state Senate was fired by his employer after casting a vote on a bill his company didn't like. Conflicts like these would be routine and ordinary, and they'd undoubtedly stretch the conscience of even the most upright part-time legislator.
Another major problem with the proposal is the troubling way it would shift power away from voters and into the hands of unelected bureaucrats, lobbyists, and other Lansing insiders. The fact of the matter is that while the proposal may limit the legislature to 90 consecutive days of action each year, the government will still be up and running ‚Äî and interfering in our lives ‚Äî for 365 of them.
Our state and our nation are built on the idea and the structure of a functioning representative democracy; or a Republic (if we can keep it). Moving the legislature to part-time status might limit the amount of time politicians hang out together at the state Capitol, but it also means stripping the people's elected representatives from the process and leaving control in the hands of well moneyed special interests, their powerful and influential lobbyists, and unelected executive branch bureaucrats.
Under the part-time scheme, only the well-financed will be able to swiftly orchestrate changes to policy with little to no input from the state's voters, let alone due process and reflection.
What's worse, these bureaucrats and insiders will never face re-election, and lack any incentive at all to behave, govern, or spend responsibly.
But perhaps the most glaring problem with this part-time proposal is the way it would immediately undermine the state's system of governmental checks and balances, taking institutional knowledge and sheer manpower out of the legislature and centralizing it with the executive branch and the Governor's office. Not surprising that the plan was put forth by a presumed candidate for governor.
The scheme is a wholesale power grab by the executive branch, unweighting the originally designed separate but equal and balanced government. Our separation of powers, many argue, is our Constitution's most salient accomplishment. This wisdom would literally be traded for folly.
Voters who value representative democracy ‚Äî or a republic ‚Äî should reject this misguided and dangerous proposal.

A family of seven living in Edmonton is desperate for help and says a deportation order will tear their tight-knit family apart.
Through an interpreter, the parents of five children told Global News a border agent confirmed flights out of the country have been booked for July.
‚ÄúI've never been apart from my children,‚Äù Yolanda Duarte Martinez said through tears. ‚ÄúI've always been with them.‚Äù
Martinez and her husband Jilmar Picon Pineda said they made the decision to send four of their children, one as young as six, to the United States where they were born. They will live with a relative.
The parents said they had been working illegally in the U.S. before they fled to Canada in 2011.
They and their adult son will be forced back to Guatemala, where they claimed other family members have been murdered.
Pico Pineda said he brought his family to Canada for safety and security and a return to Guatemala would be a death sentence.
‚ÄúOnce we get there, I'm going to be dead.‚Äù
A refugee claim had been denied, but the family applied for permanent residency through humanitarian and compassionate grounds.
Citizenship and Immigration Canada confirmed it received the application on Feb. 22, 2017. There has been no word on when that application will be reviewed.
A friend and interpreter for the family said they had trusted someone else to file the proper paperwork, but that didn't happen. They now want Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen to halt the deportation order until their case is considered.
The minister's office said he has the authority to intervene based on exceptional circumstances. Because of privacy laws, he could not comment on a specific case or application.
Ralph Goodale, the federal minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, can temporarily halt a deportation order to provide the immigration minister time to consider if something fell through the cracks.
‚ÄúThe decision to remove someone from Canada is not taken lightly,‚Äù Goodale's office said in a prepared statement.
‚ÄúEveryone ordered removed from Canada is entitled to due process before the law and all removal orders are subject to various levels of appeal.‚Äù
Edmonton Manning MP Zaid Aboultaif said he is monitoring this case closely and contacted the immigration minister's office.
With deportation looming, the parents said they will not only lose medical care for their daughter and schooling for all of their children, but each other.
‚ÄúThey're [our]children, they need our care,‚Äù Picon Pineda said.
‚ÄúWe've never been separated. We've always been together.‚Äù
There's a new kind of trophy case in town ‚Äì and the best part is, it's full of wine.
Advancements in wine storage and trends in contemporary architecture have put wine collections front and center in high-end luxury homes in ways once reserved for fine art and rare books.
The glass-enclosed rooms and cases can hold hundreds, and sometimes thousands of bottles, chicly displayed in customized temperature and humidity controlled environments behind protective ultra violet (UV)-resistant glass.
‚ÄúIt's not so much about being a show-off,‚Äù said Jamie Kasza, founder and president of Stact, a modular wine storage company, in Vancouver, Canada, ‚ÄúI think when you're passionate about [what] you're collecting‚Ä¶people don't want to bury it in the cellar.‚Äù
Kasza said one residential project included a 4,200-bottle wine storage tower designed with two parking spaces on top to showcase the homeowner's exotic sports cars. Kind of like the Bat Cave, but with wine.

Because and a great place to see whale sharks.
Whether towering over a vaulted loft space or built into an entire wall, the new direction in personal wine storage represents an industry disrupt in the centuries-old tradition of cellars.
It's a look and a philosophy, however, that is catching on fast.
Luxury real estate agent Sam Real at Nest Seekers International agreed with Kasza and said for many high-end developers customized, glass-fronted wine storage has become a staple.
‚ÄúIt's something that can add value to the property itself,‚Äù Real said.
Real said his company is currently building two large homes in Doheny Estates that are expected to sell for between $25 and $35 million dollars each. They both have wine rooms.
‚ÄúWe are about to bring a property to market in Suffolk Circle, a gated community in Beverly Hills‚Ä¶and there's a 700-bottle wine room in that one,‚Äù Real said. ‚ÄúWe just sold a Cape Cod style home in Brentwood that was about 6,000 square feet, and we had a 554-bottle wine cellar in there as well.‚Äù
Real said evidence of the growing trend can be seen in the flats of West Hollywood, Miracle Mile, and Hancock Park. ‚ÄúThese smaller homes are not necessarily doing wine rooms, but they're still doing enclosed glass cases that showcase the wine.‚Äù
Bottom line, it's a focal point that raises the bar of a well-appointed home. In this case, quite literally.
‚ÄúI don't think they're used a lot,‚Äù admits Real. ‚ÄúMany clients look at it as a showcase or trophy room...it gives another element of luxury.‚Äù

Team playing well in early season
By Tim Wester
Sports Correspondent
The freebies are over.
That's the message Union Grove baseball coach Michael Arendt wants to send his opponents this season after a sloppy 2016 campaign that saw the Broncos give opponents too many unearned runs.
After four games this season, the Broncos are already showing signs of improvement, with three wins.
‚ÄúWe played some tough competition at the Adams Friendship tournament,‚Äù Arendt said. Our two losses came against two top 15 teams in Division one.‚Äù
But in those losses, the Broncos provided a snapshot into how they want to play this season, rising to the level of the competition against Eau Claire Memorial and Eau Claire North.
‚ÄúWe played very well against Memorial and competed,‚Äù Arendt said. ‚ÄúJust an inning or two that did us in.
On top of the improved defense for the Broncos is a deep and interchangeable pitching staff that figures to be a team strength.
Nolan Rebernick is projected to be the ace of the pitching staff after earning the win in the Broncos' 7-4 victory over Racine Lutheran/Prairie. Sophomore Luke Hansel has also thrown well in the early season and figures to see plenty of time on the mound, while senior Derek Andersen figures to be a key contributor out of the bullpen.
Rebernick earned another win on the mound in Tuesday's 7-2 home victory over Delavan-Darien.
‚ÄúOur pitching is coming around nicely,‚Äù Arendt said.
‚ÄúWe have good depth with a lot of interchangeable parts that will surely help us with the pitch count rules.‚Äù
The Bronco offense figures to score a fair share of runs as well.
Returners Bradley Hansen, Alex Spang, and Peter Rossman are off to solid starts this season and figure to provide an offensive spark this spring. Shortstop Jason DeBrabander and third baseman Logan Johnson also have impressed Arendt thus far.
‚ÄúOur guys in the field are doing well and starting to learn,‚Äù Arendt said ‚ÄúWe had question marks coming into the season, but that's been something we have been trying to figure out yet.‚Äù
With improved defense and hitting and a deep rotation, the Broncos look to improve from a 10-15 record in 2016.
Unfortunately for the Broncos, the rest of the Southern Lakes Conference looks to be improved as well.
‚ÄúBurlington will be tough again and Wilmot has a great team coming back with a lot of quality players returning,‚Äù Arendt said. ‚ÄúWestosha Central should hit well and they'll be up there, and Waterford should have a nice team. Everyone in the Lakes will be tough and I expect our conference to perform well in nonconference games.‚Äù
Where do the Broncos figure in?
‚ÄúWe'll need our hitting to continue to develop and we'll need our defense to be strong,‚Äù Arendt said. ‚ÄúIf we can do both with our pitching depth, we should be able to win a lot of games.‚Äù

IONIA, Mich. (WOOD) ‚Äî In an hours-long hearing Monday, animal control officers said they do not think that three goats and a cat were killed by dogs that have been on ‚Äòdeath row' for months.
The two dogs belong to a U.S. Army veteran who lives in North Carolina. The other animals were killed in July 2016 while the veteran and dogs were visiting family in the Ionia area. The dogs were seized after being found in a pen with the dead goats and a judge later ruled common sense dictated they were probably responsible.
The family has been fighting to save the dogs, saying there's no evidence they did it. They argue the timeline doesn't add up ‚Äî that a veterinarian said the goats had been dead for hours before the dogs got out.
Monday, Ionia County Animal Control officers took the stand to say they don't believe the dogs are responsible for the attack. They said the dogs should be returned to their owners.
The defense says that the way the goats were killed indicates coyotes are the likely culprits.
The hearing is stretching into the evening and the judge says it could last until 10 p.m.
The dogs may be euthanized if the judge rules in favor of the prosecution.

Washington: Donald Trump plans to repeal a number of President Barack Obama's executive actions in his first day in the White House that he feels have ‚Äúhampered‚Äù both economic growth and job creation, the US President- elect's close aide has said.
Sean Spicer, Trump's incoming White House press secretary, said on ABC's ‚ÄúThis Week‚Äù that Trump will immediately ‚Äúrepeal a lot of the regulations and actions that have been taken by this administration over the last eight years that have hampered both economic growth and job creation.‚Äù
It was one of two moves Spicer said Trump will make immediately after he takes the oath of office on January 20. He did not specify which executive actions Trump will repeal.
However, the 70-year-old real estate billionaire-turned- politician has long been critical of Obama's moves on immigration, energy regulation and foreign policy, and could look for ways to undo those and other actions. Spicer also said Trump will begin reforms intended to ‚Äúbring a new brand to Washington‚Äù with a restriction on members of his administration becoming lobbyists for a period of five years after they leave Trump's government.
‚ÄúIt's very forward-thinking,‚Äù Spicer said. ‚ÄúWhat we've had in the past is people who have looked in the rearview mirror. This time, we're thinking forward. If you want to serve in a Trump administration, you're going to serve this country, not yourself.‚Äù
When asked whether Trump would continue his unusual and deeply controversial approach of making major policy statements over Twitter, Spicer replied, ‚ÄúSure, why not.‚Äù
‚ÄúWith all due respect,‚Äù he continued, ‚ÄúI think it freaks the mainstream media out that he has this following of over 45-plus million people that follow him on social media, that he can have a direct conversation.‚Äù
Spicer added: ‚ÄúBusiness as usual is over‚Ä¶ There's a new sheriff in town.‚Äù
When pressed repeatedly on whether Trump might reverse President Obama's steps, including the expulsion of 35 Russian agents, aimed at punishing Moscow for interfering in the US election, Spicer just said that Trump would delay any decision until he receives an intelligence briefing on the matter.

A Rancho Cucamonga man whom police chased into the heart of the tourist district on Hollywood Boulevard as bystanders looked on has been sentenced to three years in prison, Los Angeles County prosecutors said.
Tony Calloway Jr., 24, pleaded no contest to fleeing police while driving recklessly in connection with the slow-speed chase on March 9. Calloway had stolen a car in Colton and was spotted by police on the 101 Freeway. Police then chased him to Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue.
With the stolen car surrounded by police, Calloway remained in the car briefly and smoked a cigarette as officers ordered him to surrender and bystanders snapped photos and recorded the standoff on their phones.
‚ÄúThey had all their guns out and so we were like, ‚ÄòOK, maybe this is serious, maybe he has a gun,' so finally we all kind of stepped back,‚Äù witness Anette Chavez told KCBS. ‚ÄúBut at first I was like, ‚ÄòThis is exciting,' but it does get a little dangerous.‚Äù
Calloway was eventually taken into custody and dozens of tourists had a bona fide L.A. police chase story to take back home. The entire pursuit can be viewed here.

Source: Dangote eyes PPC takeover ‚Äì The Zimbabwe Independent October 6, 2017
ALIKO Dangote's 2015 deal to construct a US$400 million cement plant in Zimbabwe could be dead in the water, after Africa's richest man approached a South African cement producing company, PPC Ltd, with a takeover proposal, the businessdigest has learnt.
Hazel Ndebele
PPC is South Africa's largest cement producing company with eight manufacturing facilities and three milling depots in South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe.
This development comes as it emerged Zimbabwe only attracted US$319 million in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows last year, a plunge from US$421 million in 2015.
Zimbabwe still lags behind its regional peers such as Mozambique, South Africa and Zambia who registered US$3 billion, US$2,3 billion and US$469 million respectively in FDI inflows last year.
In 2014, the country's FDI amounted to US$545 million, showing that investment amounts have been decreasing over the last few years.
The Dangote Cement Plc, in a recent statement to the Nigerian Stock Exchange, said it has expressed its interest to the PPC board to buy ‚Äúthe entire share capital. This communication is still at the preliminary stage‚Äù, the cement maker said.
In response PPC in a statement confirmed the approach by Dangote to buy PPC.
‚ÄúThe independent board of PPC is considering the indicative proposal and will make a further announcement in due course,‚Äù the South African company said.
Sources in the investment sector told businessdigest that Dangote's interest in buying PPC could derail his cement plant investment plans in Zimbabwe as PPC already has infrastructure in the country.
‚ÄúIt has been two years since Dangote came to Zimbabwe to express his interests in different projects, one of them being to set up a cement plant. We have been told that the delay in the implementation of the different projects is that Africa's richest man is weighing his options while considering a number of issues,‚Äù a government source, who requested anonymity, said.
‚ÄúNow that Dangote wants to buy PPC, which is already set up, it can only mean that his plans to set up a cement plant in Zimbabwe could be dead in the water.‚Äù
According to the 2017 Forbes magazine, Dangote has a net worth of US$12,2 billion and his major sources of wealth are trading in cement, flour, sugar and salt.
Dangote's team of experts flew into Zimbabwe in 2015 and registered a company, Dangote Cement Zimbabwe.
However, the investment plans are yet to be implemented and the cement plant is still to be built. Dangote was granted an investment licence in September 2015 for projects entailing a cement plant, coal mine and power station.
In the same year, South African-based Zimbabwean businessman Mutumwa Mawere, who at one time had vast interests covering mining, finance, insurance, agriculture, telecoms, real estate and media, warned Dangote to tread carefully on Zimbabwe's explosive economic landscape, which he said was a minefield for investors.
He said Zimbabwe was a hostile investment terrain because of personalisation of the state, break down of the rule of law and violation of property rights, among other things. Zimbabwe ranks lowly on the World Bank Ease of Doing Business index, making it one of the worst investment destinations.
The ‚ÄúArmenian genocide‚Äù ‚Äì still stuck in Wonderland
2018-04-24 16:35 | www.trend.az | 2
Baku, Azerbaijan, April 24
By Azer Ahmadbayli ‚Äì Trend:
The traditional torchlight procession held every year on April 24 in Yerevan and dedicated to the anniversary of the ‚ÄúArmenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire in 1915‚Äù, with the mandatory burning of the Turkish flag, will not take place this year, Youth Union of Armenian Revolutionary Federation Dashnaktsutyun announced yesterday.
What is this ‚Äì softening of ultra-nationalist position towards Turkey, or lack of time to arrange the event due to the celebration of the ‚Äúvelvet revolution‚Äù?
Imagine there's a trial going on. Armenia is a potential plaintiff, while Turkey is a potential defendant. Subject matter of the trial is: Armenia asserts that an act of genocide was committed against Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire in 1915 by the authorities of that state. That is, Armenia claims that the representatives of their people were deliberately killed on racial grounds.
Turkey denies the accusation, contending that during the deportation of Armenians from Eastern Anatolia to the south of the Ottoman Empire, due to their betrayal in the rear of Turkish troops during the WWI, there were numerous cases of cruelty and violence resulting in numerous deaths, but this can never be called genocide.
What are the sides' proposals?
The Armenian position is simple. They say that there are truths that cannot be debated because of their absolute certainty. Such an "undeniable truth", as Armenians claim, is the "genocide", and Turkey must unconditionally plead guilty.
Isn't it similar to the Red Queen's "sentence first - verdict afterwards" approach from Alice in Wonderland?
Almost 30 countries recognized the events of 1915 as genocide, and, as a rule, these are the countries where there is a strong Armenian Diaspora. However, this is just a political recognition.
Legally, under international law, the final judgment to qualify the 1915 events as genocide may be made by the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
For many years, Armenia has been able to initiate the process of recognition in the International Court, but it has never done that. Why?
Maybe, because it has still doubts that Turks had the goal to eradicate Armenians as a nation? Or, there are fears that the Court may not recognize a century-old tragic event as genocide?

Romelu Lukaku, the prime one after most big games, gave further reasons for the United fans to take his case on Sunday, as his exploits at the wrong end and the lack of it at the end where it mattered, seemed the obvious factors behind the noise in the neighbourhood rising to unpleasant levels.
The numbers too don't do the Belgian any favours. In his previous 40 games against the Premier League top six, he has found the net just five times. In a United shirt, he is yet to have a hand in any goal against the big teams in the six games he's played this season.
But was there more to Red Devils' loss in the derby than just Romelu Lukaku?
United, from the first minute to the last, appeared disjointed. Their game play and strategy didn't match up to their ambitions, and it reflected in the end result. They were forced into a low defensive block after their plans of man-marking Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva were thrown out of the window in the early stages thanks to the fluid movement of City's attacking quintet.
Thereafter, United players didn't seem to have faith in their own ploy despite managing to reduce City to just two shots on target in the first 40 minutes that David de Gea would have saved even in deep sleep.
There was a lack of assurance in the home side's play as their attacking resources were exhausted in keeping City quiet. 46 percent of Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial's touches in the entire game were inside United's half. The duo was deployed in wide areas to exploit space vacated by City's full-backs, but that threat never materialised. In the end, Martial and Rashford made just five touches inside the City penalty area.
Lukaku was isolated, and despite winning five aerial duels in the entire game‚Äîthe most by any United player‚Äîthere was no United player around to make something out of it. Jesse Lingard who was playing off the Belgian was chasing Fernandinho for most parts of the game.
In a strange end to the first half, both defences cracked to leave us with a 1-1 scoreline that seemed unlikely five minutes before the interval. Both sides produced two shots on goal each in those final five minutes of the first half. Having conceded the lead to City, United had got out of jail at the break.
The home side continued with their timid display in the second half despite getting a late lifeline in the first. Jose Mourinho's ploy was to keep it tight at the back and nick one on the break somehow, but his side conceded minutes after the restart, once again from a set-piece to gift the lead back to City.
Once bittern twice shy, Pep Guardiola brought on defensive reinforcements almost immediately after regaining the lead to prevent any more defensive lapses that would invite United back into the game.
The hosts looked lost for most parts of the game after going behind as they never truly got out of their defensive gear. It was only late in the day that United conjured their best move of the game. Substitute Juan Mata lofted a ball over the defence to find Martial on the edge of the penalty area on the left side. The Frenchman drilled a low cross across the face of the goal that Lukaku could only fire straight at Ederson. The Brazilian goalkeeper then produced another fine save to deny Mata off the rebound as City held on fairly comfortably in the end to seal a massive victory.
The defeat didn't just send City 11 points clear, but further tarnished Mourinho's big-game record. Once a man known to rule the roost in matches against fellow rivals, the Portuguese now seems a shadow of his illustrious past.
In the 18 games against top six sides in the league as Manchester United manager, Mourinho has won just four. For a team of United's calibre who have invested millions in their squad over the past three seasons, it's a poor return. So if Lukaku is a flat-track bully, what must be said of Mourinho?
The Portuguese's track record leaves little room for doubts, but for the first time in his career, the former Real Madrid and Chelsea manager might have to mend his ways, especially in big games. The game against Manchester City was alarming in that aspect. United players didn't seem at home in the system they played or were forced to play in. They didn't seem to believe in what they were doing. There seemed to be a gap in how the players would like to play and how they were actually playing.
A Mourinho team never loses the way United did against City. It never gives away cheap goals in big games, it plays with an unwavering belief, sometimes even when their own fans jeer them. May be, United aren't a Mourinho team, maybe not just yet. Or is Jose Mourinho not a Manchester United type of manager?
Mourinho over his time in charge has tried his best to create a siege mentality in his team. He did so even after the defeat on Sunday where he indirectly accused the referees of favouring City, of the runaway leaders being lucky and his team being denied "big penalties". That siege mentality is what has made his teams bring that bit extra onto the pitch.
But the United players, apart from a few, don't seem to be buying into it. The performance against City and in the few other games against the big boys has shown that.
May be, it's time Mourinho takes the shackles off his players in big games. Maybe it's time, he treads a different path. After 18 games of playing his way and not quite succeeding, it may be time for him to empower his players with a bit more freedom in big games and allow them to show what they are capable of.
Ariana Grande's outpouring of love and support for Manchester following the terror attack at her concert on May 22 hasn't gone unnoticed. As part of a new system to recognise non-citizen's outstanding contributions to the city, the council is proposing that the singer become the first honorary citizen of Manchester following her "great many selfless acts and demonstrations of community spirit," including her benefit concert, One Love Manchester, which raised money for the victims of the bombing.
"This seems a fitting moment to update the way we recognise those who make noteworthy contributions to the life and success of our city," Manchester city council leader Sir Richard Leese said. "We've all had cause to be incredibly proud of Manchester and the resilient and compassionate way in which the city, and all those associated with it, have responded to the terrible events of 22 May, with love and courage rather than hatred and fear," he added. "Ariana Grande exemplified this response. I think many people would already consider her an honorary Mancunian and we would be delighted, if the council approves the proposal, to make it official."

Xinhua ‚Äì Cuba and Dominica on Tuesday agreed to deepen ties for the benefit of both peoples.
Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel and visiting Dominican Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit discussed bilateral and regional issues at the Presidential Palace, Cuban State TV reported.
They agreed that bilateral ties are in ‚Äúgood state‚Äù and vowed to deepen economic and social cooperation.
Skerrit thanked the Cuban government for its collaboration, particularly the help offered by rescue workers, doctors, construction personnel and other staff in the recovery after hurricane Maria devastated the Caribbean island last year.
Meanwhile, Diaz-Canel reaffirmed Cuba's continued support for Dominica, said the report.
Skerrit's visit to Cuba came just a day before the 39th meeting of Heads of State of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in Jamaica.

CARICOM leaders will seek to tackle a number of critical issues that impact the economic and social advancement of regional countries.
Apple buys Shazam, the song-recognition app
Apple has bought Shazam, the maker of a song-recognition app that the technology titan's Siri digital assistant already uses to help people identify the music playing on their iPhones.
The companies didn't disclose the price of the acquisition announced Monday. Recode previously reported Apple (AAPL) is paying about $400 million for Shazam, citing three unidentified people familiar with the deal. Previous funding rounds had valued the startup as high as $1 billion, according to Crunchbase.
Snap and Spotify had also approached Shazam about a possible deal, according to reports.
Apple issued a statement describing Shazam as ‚Äúnatural fit‚Äù with its services, but declined to say whether Shazam's app will still be available after the deal closes. It's unclear what will happen to Shazam's existing partnership with Spotify.
In 2014, Siri began using Shazam's technology to answer questions about songs as part of an update to the iPhone's operating system. Since then, Apple has launched a music streaming service that has more than 27 million subscribers.

Note: Police forces in England and Wales can class five types of racially or religiously aggravated offences as hate crimes: assault with injury; assault without injury; harassment; public fear, alarm or distress; and other criminal damage. These categories are defined by statute, and have been used to compile the figures listed above, based on police force open data. Forces can decide to identify other types of offences as hate crimes, however, meaning the overall total could be higher.
WorkSafeBC wants you to keep safe while hanging those Christmas lights this year
On average more than 930 workers in British Columbia are seriously injured each year due to falls from ladders and many of those incidents were preventable.
With the holiday season in full swing, WorkSafe BC wants you to know that using a ladder around the house has risks too.
WorkSafeBC has released six new ladder-safety videos to remind workers, employers and homeowners to use ladders safely, both on the job and while decorating at home for the holidays.
‚ÄúLast year, more than 1,000 workers were seriously injured in falls from height, including while using stepladders, extension ladders and scaffolding,‚Äù says Dan Strand, Director of Prevention Field Services for WorkSafeBC.
‚ÄúThe new videos and our ladder safety resources illustrate how the right ladder, the correct positioning and hazard assessments could prevent a life-changing serious injury or death.‚Äù
From 2012 to 2016, six workers died and there were 4,920 accepted time-loss claims ‚Äî including 1,634 serious injuries ‚Äî as a result of falls from ladders across all industries in B.C.
It's time to use ladders safely:
Select the right ladder for the job and ensure the ladder is long enough to extend one metre above the upper landing
Place the ladder on a firm, level surface and inspect it before each use to ensure it's in good working condition, looking for issues such as cracks or loose rungs
Always maintain three points of contact while climbing a ladder: two feet and one hand or two hands and one foot
Don't carry heavy or bulky objects while climbing up or down a ladder
Don't work from the top two rungs of the ladder or have more than one worker on a ladder at once
Wind, rain, and snow may pose additional hazards that need to be mitigated
Check for power lines and ensure a minimum distance of three metres can be maintained at all times before starting work

MULTAN - The Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) secretary general said on Tuesday that the MMA aimed to enforce Nizam-e-Mustafa in the country, and that it would announce its manifesto on June 4.
Talking to journalists and addressing a meeting of MMA office-bearers here on Tuesday, Secretary General of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) and the Jamaat-e-Islami Liaqat Baloch added that the MMA would hold a series of public meetings across the country to make the people aware of its manifesto and win their support for upcoming elections. He disclosed that the MMA would hold a public meeting in Peshawar on June 24, Multan 29, Karachi July 1, Quetta July 4, Rawalpindi July 8 and Abbotabad July 12.
He said that the motive behind MMA's struggle was to enforce Islamic code in the country, introduce Islamic law and justice, bring prosperity to the society, ensure healthcare and education to all, across the board accountability, just distribution of resources, elimination of interest, getting the country rid of foreign loans, supremacy of law and constitution, retrieval of rights of minorities, labourers, farmers and youth and protection of national institutions.
He said that the creation of South Punjab province was basic right of the residents and the MMA would create South Punjab and other provinces on administrative grounds after coming to power. He strongly condemned police baton charge on people protesting FATA merger in Peshawar. He said that the KPK government deprived the people of their constitutional right of peaceful protest. He declared that the MMA would chalk out its line of action on FATA issue in its upcoming Karachi meeting. He said that the electoral sign book had been allotted to the MMA and its candidates would contest upcoming elections on the same sign. He said that efforts were underway to bring all the religious parties on board at the MMA platform. He declared that the MMA would enforce Islamic code in the country after winning the election.
He claimed that the MMA's June 28 public meeting in Multan would create a new history. He added that the major agenda of MMA was to eradicate injustice, oppression and corruption as well as enforce Nizam-e-Mustafa in the country.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Standing on the field at the Miami Dolphins' stadium, Serena Williams used a two-hand grip to stick her shovel in the dirt, flashed a smile and flicked a forehand.
When she comes back, she plans to be holding a racket.
On the eve of the Miami Open on Key Biscayne, the tournament held a groundbreaking ceremony Monday at its future site -- the Dolphins' stadium. The tournament will move there in 2019, and the draw is expected to include Williams, an eight-time champion who now has a financial stake because she owns a small share of the Dolphins.
"She'll probably be the first person to win a tennis tournament she owns," Dolphins majority owner Stephen Ross said with a laugh.
Ross overcame much skepticism to swing a deal for the move. The tournament has been held since 1987 on Key Biscayne, but a 2015 appeals court decision prevented upgrades to the complex there, raising speculation the Miami Open might leave South Florida, with potential sites ranging from South America to China.
Ross reached out to Mark Shapiro, co-president of IMG, which owns the tournament, and proposed moving it 18 miles north to the Dolphins' home.
"Mark thought I was crazy -- 'What do you mean? It's a football stadium?'" Ross said. "Most people when I spoke to them about the idea said, 'It's crazy. It's not going to happen.' But I think we're going to create one of the truly great sports venues in the world. And this is going to be the greatest tennis tournament in the world."
Williams nodded as Ross spoke.
"I thought Steve was crazy too, for the record," Williams said. "But he's a visionary and always thinking out of the box, and it's such a great idea. We want this to be the best tournament ever."
Ross spent $500 million on recent stadium renovations, including a canopy, and now the backhoes and front-end loaders have returned. While the ceremonial groundbreaking was Monday, work began weeks ago to construct outer courts and a spectator plaza in the parking lot adjacent to the stadium.
Center court will be in the stadium, with the net over the 50-yard line. Most of the seats will be temporary to create a 13,800-seat showcase court in a building that can hold 65,000. Fabric screens will help hide unused seats.
Ross swears it will work. And others attending the ceremony insisted the new complex represents progress for the tournament, even if the spectacular drive over Biscayne Bay to the island of Key Biscayne can't be replicated in a suburban setting.
"We're talking about a footprint here that is really unimaginable, filled with music and art and culinary attractions and culture for families," Shapiro said. "It will be much, much more than just tennis. Every aspect of the tournament will be improved."
New tournament director James Blake agreed.
"We'll have more practice courts, better facilities, better locker rooms, cutting edge video screens, more parking," Blake said. "Every single aspect is going to be an upgrade."
Williams, along with the other pros, will play on Key Biscayne for a final time beginning with her first-round match Wednesday. She grew up 90 minutes to the north in Palm Beach Gardens, attended the tournament as a youngster and has long considered it her hometown event.
"When I heard they were going to move it, it literally broke my heart," she said. "I'm so happy this tournament is still going to be in Miami."

LONDON Iranian forces killed three members of a Sunni Muslim jihadist group in the city of Chabahar on Wednesday and arrested five others, state media reported, as security forces stepped up measures to prevent militant attacks.Last week, suicide bombers and gunmen attacked parliament and Ayatollah Khomeini's mausoleum in Tehran, killing 17 people in what was an unprecedented security breach for the Islamic Republic.
Islamic State claimed responsibility and threatened more attacks against Iran's majority Shi'ite population, whom the hardline Sunni militants consider heretics.Iran has arrested almost 50 people in connection with the attacks. On Wednesday, state media reported that security forces had fought with members of Ansar al-Furqan, a militant Sunni group, in Chabahar, a city in southeastern Iran.
State media said three militants had been killed and five arrested. One security officer was also killed and one wounded. Authorities said they had found ammunition, explosive belts and weapons.
Ansar al-Furqan - or Partisans of the Criterion - is a Sunni group based in Sistan and Baluchestan province that has threatened to carry out suicide attacks on economic and military centres in revenge for the government's execution of Sunni prisoners.The group, which was formed by the merger of some Sunni Baluch insurgent groups in 2012, is not linked to Islamic State. But it has carried out periodic attacks on military and civilian targets, aiming to highlight what it says is discrimination against Iran's Sunni ethnic groups.

BJP leader files complaint against John Abraham's Satyamev Jayate, alleges film hurts Shia sentiments
A complaint has been filed in Hyderabad against John Abraham's upcoming film Satyamev Jayate for allegedly hurting the sentiments of the Shia community. Jafri, who is the general secretary of the BJP Minority Front has alleged that the trailer of the film portrays the procession of Muharram in a bad light, according to a report by National Herald.
Jafri has also requested the local branch of Central Board of Film Certification to transfer the complaint to their head office in Mumbai. Speaking about what exactly has irked the, he says, "There is one shot in the trailer which shows the festival of Muharram and it depicts a scene of Matam (self-flagellation). The actor is later shown committing a murder following Matam. This has hurt our sentiments."
A lawyer reportedly close to the development has also claimed that the Muharram scene is not pivotal to the story of the film and could have easily been done away with. The complainant have also requested the CBFC to remove the altogether and have threatened to stage protests and not let the film release if their demands are not met.
Written and directed by Milap Zaveri, Satyamev Jayate also stars Manoj Bajpayee. The film hits the theatres on 15 August and is clashing with Akshay Kumar's sports drama, Gold.

Yer a dealer, Harry! A teenager with the same name as The Boy Who Lived has been arrested in York, England for possession of cannabis. The Metro reports that Potter, 19, was pulled over by police and found with a few wraps of the green stuff and around $90 on him.
For some reason, the cops decided to waste taxpayers' time and money by charging the kid with possession and intent to distribute, and thus a bunch of Potter-related headlines were born.

It's long been posited that marijuana exists within the Potterverse, specifically in the chilled-out, bader-loving herbology house Hufflepuff. It doesn't take much to imagine Professor Sprout trundling into the Forbidden Forest to harvest that dank Hogwarts ganj. Just don't let Snape catch you with it: he's unlikely to believe it's just Gillyweed...
Poll Is this news? No, why arrest some kid with a bit of ganj?

Indore: No incident of ceasefire violation by Pakistan on the international border has come to light in over a week in the areas guarded by the Border Security Force (BSF), the force's director general KK Sharma said on Friday.
However, any misadventure by the neighbouring country will get a befitting reply from the paramilitary force which has been deployed along the border, he warned.
Speaking to reporters, Sharma said there has been peace in the areas along the International Border since 23-24 January, where the BSF is deployed. "No incident of ceasefire violation from the Pakistan side has been reported in this area of late," Sharma said.
On 25 January, there was a flag-meeting at the request of the Pakistan Rangers and both sides decided there would be no ceasefire violation on the international border, the top official said.
He also said the BSF is ready to face any situation on the border and if Pakistan indulges in any misadventure it would get a befitting reply.
There were several instances of ceasefire violations by Pakistan last month.
Collision shuts highway in both directions about 10 kilmotres east of that community
One person has been taken to hospital in critical condition following a crash that occurred this morning and has closed Highway 3 south of Cranbrook.
Few details are available, so far, but according to DriveBC, Highway 3 and Highway 95 and closed in both directions about 10 kilometres east of Yahk.
BCEHS paramedics are on the scene with four ground ambulances and one air ambulance. We will update you when more information becomes available. https://t.co/PSd9xlVUD3 ‚Äî EmergHealthServices (@BC_EHS) February 3, 2018
Westbound traffic is currently being turned around just east of the collision, while flaggers in Cranbrook are warning drivers about the road closure.
No detours are available. Estimated time the road will re-open is 6 p.m.
USC coach Clay Helton said he would never forget the first time he saw Joseph Lewis IV play in person for Hawkins High. If he was lucky, Helton thought, he'd be getting a very nice receiver prospect. But he saw more.
‚ÄúI was even more impressed with him defensively,‚Äù Helton said. ‚ÄúHe reminded me of JuJu. It was like, oh my god, this guy can play wideout or safety if you wanted to.‚Äù
Lewis provides what USC's receiving corps lacks: Star potential ‚Äî the kind it lost when JuJu Smith-Schuster left for the NFL in the offseason ‚Äî and a big, physical presence.
As USC's offense adjusts after the reality check it received in Saturday's scrimmage, freshmen such as Lewis and Randal Grimes could tempt.
Helton reviewed the scrimmage film, when the offense had only one drive out of eight that didn't result in a three and out or a turnover, and the results were something short of catastrophic.
"It's never as bad as you thought or never as good as you thought,‚Äù Helton said.
Helton blamed the same culprit he did after the scrimmage: The playbook, he said, was bigger than a normal game week. That resulted in missed assignments and a toothless offense.
Overall, he said he came away happy with the offensive line. USC's running backs are deep, talented and proven. Quarterback Sam Darnold didn't play well in the scrimmage, but he is a star. That leaves on area of concern: the wideouts.
The Trojans lost experience and play-making ability with the departures of Smith-Schuster and Darreus Rogers. They also lost size. Smith-Schuster was 220 pounds, Rogers was 215.
Replacements USC has used on the first team include Jalen Greene (200 pounds), Steven Mitchell Jr. (195) and Tyler Vaughns (185). Slot receiver Deontay Burnett is 170 pounds.
Size doesn't determine everything for a receiver. And USC has lots of speed at the position. But it was clear Saturday that bigger secondaries, like the Trojans' own, could disrupt timing.
Helton said he was less worried about size than finding three effective players.
‚ÄúI look at a guy like Deontay Burnett who might not be the biggest guy in the world, but he's so productive,‚Äù Helton said. ‚ÄúAnd we do things offensively and schematically to be able to get guys open, whether it's put them in motion, stack them, be able to get hands off of them.‚Äù
Yet, aside from Burnett, no receivers have become indispensable. Green and Vaughns have started a majority of the snaps, though their statuses are not locked.
There are bigger options available. Michael Pittman Jr. is 6-feet-4 and 215 pounds. However, his opportunities in practice have dwindled.
The freshmen have already added considerable bulk. Grimes is listed at 6-4, 205; Helton says he has added 10 pounds. Lewis is listed at 6-2, 205; Helton said he weighs 220 now, ‚Äúa huge person,‚Äù he said.
Neither has cracked the first-team offense yet. But Helton said each could make an impact this season.
After a groin injury limited Lewis early in camp, he returned to make a tough catch in traffic for a touchdown in the scrimmage, against the second-team defense.
He lacks much time to prove his case. Helton is getting close to settling on a depth chart for USC's first game.
"This is a really important week for us this Monday through Saturday to let kids show us one last time where they're at,‚Äù Helton said.
He added that he is open to changes throughout the season.
O-line OK
The offensive line must replace three starters from last season. Helton said the first signs on film left him optimistic, particularly on the interior of the line.
"We are extremely deep,‚Äù Helton said. ‚ÄúI love our one- and two-deep right now. And some people would be envious of the threes. Are they young? Yes. There are not many older guys up there, but at each position you could see guys that I think could start for a lot of people in this league.‚Äù
Quick hit
Tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe has shown signs of progress as he continues a running program to rehabilitate an injured hip flexor. Helton expects him back in about one week.

To gift or not to gift
Posted on December 11, 2017 by Eric Gullotta
That is the question. As Christmas time approaches, seemingly fast every year, I wanted to discuss gifting. No, not the re-gifting you're going to do with the fruitcake or massaging cell phone case. The gifting you do to transfer wealth to the next generation in a way that minimizes fees and most importantly, taxes.
There are essentially two types of gifts; intervivos and testamentary. Yes, that is Latin and yes, I'm trying to impress you. Simply, intervivos gifts are gifts made ‚Äúduring life‚Äù and testamentary gifts are those made ‚Äúat death‚Äù. Let's explore the basics of the two types and then get into the nitty-gritty.
Gifts during life are a common occurrence for most of us. We give our loved ones gifts for birthdays, milestones and holidays. Sometimes we give our loved ones (usually children) large gifts as a way to transfer wealth. Many people know the IRS' gifting rules; you can only give away $14,000 per person per donor before you have to start paying gift tax. Yes, there is a tax on gifting money. In 2018, this amount increases to $15,000. So, what happens when you gift more than that?
When you make a gift during life of more than the amount allowed to pass tax free, you must file a 709, ‚ÄúUnited States Gift Tax Return‚Äù declaring the gift to the IRS and paying the tax (or showing a reduction in your lifetime gift allowance. This form also serves to report your ‚Äútax basis‚Äù for the purposes of calculating gain or loss in the future. Acciridng to IRS rules, the receiving party's ‚Äútax basis‚Äù is the same as the ‚Äútax basis‚Äù from the person making the gift.
Let's look at an example. You gift your home to your son. You originally purchased the home for $150,000. It is now worth $1,000,000. This is Sonoma after all! When you gift your home to your son, his ‚Äútax basis‚Äù is now your original $150,000. This means that if your son sells the house, he has deferred or built-in gain of $850,000. This would result in tax of approximately $250,000. Ouch.
What about ‚Äútax basis‚Äù? The rule says that if you receive a gift from someone because of the donor's death (and not during the donor's life) then the person receiving the gift's ‚Äútax basis‚Äù is the fair market value at the donor's date of death.
OK, it'll clear what this means with this similar example: You gift your home to your son. You originally purchased the home for $150,000. It is now worth $1,000,000. When you die you leave your house (via a well thought out and comprehensive estate plan created by a competent estate planning attorney). Your son's tax basis is the fair market value of $1,000,000. This means that if your son sells the house, he has NO deferred or built-in gain and there is NO tax to pay ‚Äì compare this to the gift during life of the same house that yielded $250,000 in tax.
The simple lesson here is that gifting at death will likely result in favorable tax consequences to the recipient. If you want your kids to get more and the IRS less, create a gifting strategy that minimizes taxes and maximizes the benefits.
Please note that our current tax bill could change this but it is unlikely. Many of the issues they are discussing won't affect the gifting rules but they could change the gifting amounts. Stay tuned!
There are 800 hundred vacant houses and buildings in the city of Davenport. City leaders say they're an eyesore, but tonight they have a plan to fix the problem, starting with 4 empty houses.
On Walling Court in Davenport sits an abandoned house, that's been collecting more than just dust and the neighbors are feed up.
‚ÄúIt's not fun to look at it. It's run down, said Erica Krog, a resident in the area.
The house has been in the same condition since Daniel and Erica Krog moved in back in 2013.
‚ÄúIt's just getting worse and worse and more run down and deteriorated. When are we going to do something about it? Does it have to completely fall down and who will be around when that happens,‚Äù said Erica Krog.
Not only do they worry about the structure of the house, but other neighbors also say it's bringing the value of the neighborhood down.
‚ÄúThis is a nice neighborhood and we have got a lot of houses that have had a lot of work put into them, said Jay Detmer, a resident in the area.
Neighbors on Walling Court aren't the only ones having to deal with empty houses.
On Bridge Avenue, it's the same thing and city council members say something has to be done about the 800 hundred vacant properties lingering around in the city.
‚ÄúWhen you look at cities across the countries that are dealing with vacant properties, Davenport has a relatively modest problem, but it's a problem for us,‚Äù said Marion Meginnis, 3rd Ward Alderman.
That's why they are starting a process to obtain properties like Walling Court and Bridge Avenue. Council members say they would go to court and have to prove to the judge the houses are empty. If the judge agrees the city would take over the houses and they can decide what to do with them.
Neighbors on Walling Court say at this point anything is better than the house sitting there.
‚ÄúIt's possible to renovate it into a living area or a duplex. Something like that, since it's already there we can put it to use,‚Äù said Daniel Krog, Erica's husband.
City leaders say if they get approval for this, one option would be to auction the properties off to the highest bidder.
This statement was originally published on article19.org on 23 April 2018.
On 25 April 2018, the African Commission on Human and People's rights will hold its 62nd ordinary session in Nouakchott, Mauritania, to discuss the situation of human rights across the continent, including freedom of expression. From 21 April, NGOs from Africa and beyond will join the pre-session NGO Forum, to discuss issues to be raised in the main session. Key amongst these will be the situation of freedom of expression and access to information on the continent.
The agenda of the main session will have several slots addressing freedom of expression and access to information, most importantly the address by the Vice-Chairperson & Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa. The Commission will also review reports from Eritrea, Togo and Nigeria.
ARTICLE 19's Eastern Africa team will be present during the NGO Forum and the main session to advocate for the adoption of progressive access to information and freedom of expression standards, while also urging state parties to put an end to impunity for attacks on journalists, human rights defenders, and others exercising their right to free expression in Africa.
Our priorities for ACHPR 62 are:
Seeking accountability for violations of freedom of expression in Eritrea, Tanzania, and Kenya.
Discussion on the revision of the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa.
Participation in launch of the Guidelines on Elections and Access to Information in Africa.
Country situations
The situation of freedom of expression has been on the decline in most countries in the Eastern Africa region, owing in part to turbulent socio-political currents in the region. ARTICLE 19 will be raising our concerns on several countries where this decline has been most concerning. We will address the session during the review of Eritrea's initial report to the Commission to highlight the dire situation for free expression in the country, and will be advocating for accountability throughout the session for recent media freedom violations in Tanzania and Kenya.
Eritrea submits initial report to the ACHPR
While we welcome the long overdue submission by the Eritrean government of its report to the ACHPR on the situation of human rights in Eritrea, assessing its progress towards the guarantee of the rights laid out in the Banjul Charter, there remain serious questions of accountability for freedom of expression violations in the country, which has made little progress in recent years.
We will be addressing the state and Commission to push for the release of approximately 60 journalists, human rights defenders (HRDs) and others arbitrarily arrested and detained by the regime since 2001 for expressing their opposition to the systematically entrenched oppression by the state. In this regard, we will be calling for implementation of the Article 19 v Eritrea (2007) decision that ordered for the unconditional release of all journalists and HRDs detained by the state. We will also be advocating for the government to open up media ownership to non-state actors to encourage media pluralism as a step towards the enjoyment of the right to free expression for all Eritreans.
Freedom of expression plunges in Tanzania
Since 2015, freedom of expression has significantly deteriorated in Tanzania with TV, newspapers, and radio stations closed for airing content deemed unsavory by the state.
There has also been the enactment of a litany of laws that encourage self-censorship by introducing criminal sanctions for certain types of expression both online and offline. These have even led to the imprisonment of parliamentarians who have openly stated their opposition to the activities of the state.
The country also passed Access to Information law in 2016 with a clause that heavily sanctions wrongful disclosure of information, while not sanctioning the wrongful withholding of information, meaning it fails to guarantee access to information in any meaningful way.
Spotlight on media violations in Kenya
The 30 January 2018 shutdown of three major TV stations in Kenya is by far the biggest indication of the increasingly alarming level of state interference in media freedom in the country.
There are also significant concerns about increased impunity for attacks on journalists and HRDs in the country, in addition to the close to 100 people who were killed in protests during the instability of the election period.
Revision of the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and launch of the Guidelines on Elections and Access to Information
ARTICLE 19 was one of the lead organizations involved in pushing for the adoption of the Declaration on Freedom of Expression in Africa in 2002. In 2012, Section IV of the Declaration was expanded to include access to information provisions. Since then, over the years, both the Commission and CSOs have agreed that the Declaration needs to be revised to make it capable of addressing freedom of expression in a much more evolved telecommunications environment.
At ACHPR 62, we're pushing for the adoption of guidelines or general comments on the Declaration to include our principles on pertinent expression issues in the digital age, including data protection and privacy as safeguards of expression online, addressing internet shutdowns, mass surveillance, and regulation of speech in online platforms in line with international standards. The Declaration is already a crucial tool for the promotion of freedom of expression and access to information in the continent, with the Commission making reference to it during the review of periodic and national reports delivered by state parties. The revised Declaration will go further in clarifying what obligations states have regarding promoting expression in online spaces.
Additionally, we will be participating in the launch of Guidelines on Elections and Access to Information in Africa. Having been part of the process of the drafting and adoption of the guidelines, we will be addressing the forum on critical information that ought to be disclosed proactively by Electoral Management Bodies, and that ought to be disclosed upon request. Access to information regarding elections is not only key to promoting integrity of the electoral process but also in ensuring voters are well informed about the procedure.
A lost dog that was turned in to the Hawaiian Humane Society was never returned to its owner.
A woman contacted KHON2 saying by the time she went to the humane society to claim her dog, she was told it had already been adopted.
The dog did not have any identification, so the humane society says it didn't have a choice.
Without an ID tag or a microchip, lost pets will be up for adoption after 48 hours.
‚ÄúAfter the two days are up, the dog will be assessed for health and behavior, and if they have not been sterilized, then they will be spayed and neutered and they make it out to our adoptions floor,‚Äù said Suzy Tam from the Hawaiian Humane Society.
Officials say it's critical to have some form of identification.
If your pet has proper identification, the humane society waits nine days before it is adopted out. During that time, the humane society will also try to get a hold of the owner.
‚ÄúWe will make every effort to contact you, so it's really important to make sure your contact information is also updated with us. We will send out an email. We'll try to call you, so we'll do everything we can to reunite you with your missing pet,‚Äù Tam said.
Tam says a microchip is the best form of identification, because it can't get lost. Dogs, cats, and rabbits can get microchipped, and the humane society provides them for $20 each.
In the past fiscal year, the Hawaiian Humane Society tells us that it has reunited more than 2,600 pets with their families. Tam adds that once you lose your dog, you should fill out a report right away on the humane society's website.
‚ÄúUpload a photo of your pet, and it's really important to do that as long as you know your dog or your cat or whatever animal you have is not there, and that way we can try to make a match just on the picture or descriptions you have,‚Äù Tam said.
As for the woman who contacted us, she wanted to know who adopted her dog. The humane society says it cannot provide that information.
‚ÄúWe really want to protect the privacy of our guests and any adopters, so we don't release any information to anyone. We just want to make sure everyone stays safe and that their privacy is safeguarded through us,‚Äù Tam said.

Civil rights organizations have sounded the alarm again on voter suppression. This time, Georgia Republicans are trying to pass a bill that would put an end to Black parishioners voting early either before or after they have attended church services in Atlanta. Yes, they want a Suppression Sunday.
But there's more to the story: GOP lawmakers want to also reduce the number of evening hours that voters can head to the polls. The majority-Republican House Governmental Affairs Committee approved Senate Bill 363 on Wednesday, saying that polling places should close at 7 p.m. instead of 8 p.m., and that voting should be limited to only one weekend day, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.
This move, opposed by the committee's five Democrats, is undoubtedly controversial.
‚ÄúThe impact of this bill is to eliminate the extra hour of voting opportunity that's been granted to city of Atlanta voters,‚Äù Democratic Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, who represents Decatur, said. ‚ÄúSo this is anti-voting rights for Atlanta.‚Äù
The bill will stop African-American voters, who make up the majority of the city's population, from turning out in droves as part of Souls to the Polls events, a voter mobilization effort for Sunday voting in Georgia. Curtailing voting hours is also out-of-sync with Georgia regulations.
Atlanta can keep its precincts open until 8 p.m. for municipal elections, according to a state law passed in the 1970s.
Voting must be allowed on Saturdays for elections with state or federal candidates, but Sunday polling has been a hot-button issue. Georgia Republicans have been against Sunday voting since at least 2014, the year that DeKalb County extended early voting hours to include the Sunday before Election Day, according to Think Progress.
If the bill passes, activists will most likely be coming in full force against GOP legislators. They, along with Democrats, may oppose the bill under the Voting Rights Act after voter ID laws, same-day registration eliminations and more suppression efforts have disproportionately targeted voters of color.
Voting right advocates have already sounded off about the bill on Twitter.
Georgia Republicans snuck in a provision to a bill that eliminates Sunday voting which specifically targets African Americans voters. Retweet if you're enraged about this blatant attempt to suppress voters. #FridayFeeling ‚Äî Let America Vote (@letamericavote) March 16, 2018

Hugh Jackman revealed that he was recently treated for skin cancer on his nose again. This was his fifth treatment in four consecutive years.
According to US Magazine, the 48-year old Hollywood prodigy took it to social media and shared a photograph with bandaged nose with his fans and explained what it looks to have a cancerous nose surgery. The Oscar-winning alum revealed that he was treated for his nose cancer again on February 13.
Another basal cell carcinoma. Thanks to frequent checks & amazing doctors, all's well. Looks worse w the dressing on then off! WEARSUNSCREEN pic.twitter.com/IA7N6Ca3Oe Advertisement ‚Äî Hugh Jackman (@RealHughJackman) February 13, 2017
The actor appeared to be in high hopes as he mentioned that everything is sorted out well. According to him, frequent medical examinations and with the guidance of qualified medical examiners, he was able to post this selfie.
"Another basal cell carcinoma. Thanks to frequent body checks and amazing doctors, all is well. Looks worse with the dressing on than off. I swear! #wearsunscreen,"
The Wolverine star revealed his first-time skin cancer case in 2013. He was diagnosed with skin cancer and posted a similar selfie at that time as well. Since then, the actor has undergone five surgeries and has made sure to stress how essential wearing sunblock is.
He explained that his wife Debora Lee Furness had asked him to get the apparent "mark" on the nose get examined by the professionals. However, the results were a bit jaw-dropping as it turned out that he had basal cell carcinoma. He continued writing and suggested others get themselves checked to add Hugh is also advising people to wear sunscreen for direct exposure to the sun.
Basal cell carcinoma, even though not fatal, but can cause a lot of skin damage if not treated on time. This can easily cause disfigurement of the skin or distortion of tissues surrounding the affected area. It is still considered to cause discomfort.
Hugh had made sure to communicate with his fans regarding the case. He said that basal cell carcinomas are not life-threatening, but rather than assuming, it's foolishness to not visit a doctor, reports E! News.
On May 2014, Hugh attended the red carpet premiere of X-Men: Days of Future Past just a couple of days after his nose surgery. While his nose bandage was still on, Hugh remained high-spirited and continued clicking photos with fans.
Twenty-one-year-old Alaa ad-Dali was among the recipients of 1,100 bicycles Turkey sent as gifts to the Gaza Strip, to improve cycling as a sport in the Palestinian territory under an Israeli blockade.
For two years after receiving the bicycle, ad-Dali worked hard to become a long-distance cyclist, his childhood dream. But little did he know that his dreams would come crashing when he joined the activists at the Great March of Return.
The young cyclist was among those rallying on the Gaza border for a six-week protest that will end in May, calling for a right of return for Palestinians driven from their hometowns during the creation of Israel. Some 41 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops indiscriminately firing on protesters since the rallies began on March 30.
"I had an athlete's uniform and was visiting tents of [protesters], when an Israeli bullet hit me," ad-Dali told Anadolu Agency (AA). He was only 200 meters away from the barbed wire marking the border. "I felt like being electrocuted when I was hit. I was in a pool of blood when I fell down," he recounted the moments of shooting as a bullet hit him in the right leg.
He was taken to a nearby hospital, which was already flooded with people injured in the protest. He had to wait for about three hours for treatment and was admitted to intensive care where he spent two days. He underwent eight surgeries as desperate doctors raced against time to save his leg from amputation but all efforts proved futile.
Leaning on the crutches he is trying to get accustomed to, ad-Dali says he feels like his dreams were "shattered altogether." Nevertheless, he believes he can rebuild them and "hang the Palestinian flag high" in the cycling world, "if only I can have a prosthetic leg." Time will tell if he can resume what was a budding career that he hoped would flourish as he competed for a spot in the Palestinian cycling team for an upcoming event in Indonesia.
Riding since eight, ad-Dali had made it to the Palestinians' national cycling team in 2014 and had several medals under his belt. He says he hoped to win more. "I am grateful to Turkey for helping us realize our dreams," ad-Dali said.
He counts on the country for his treatment too as the Gaza Strip, under the Israeli blockade, suffers from a severe shortage in medical staff and medical equipment for prosthetic surgery.
Earlier this month, three wheelchair-bound siblings from the Gaza Strip were transferred to Turkey with Ankara's efforts. Siblings between the ages of one and nine, who were born with a congenital amputation, will be implanted with prosthetic legs.
Cycling is among a few fledgling sports for would-be athletes in Gaza. Saed Tamraz, head of Federation of Palestinian Cyclists says along with regular bicycles, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan personally sent 10 racing bicycles to them. "We didn't have bicycles complying with international standards for racing. We couldn't afford them before," Tamraz told AA. "Erdoƒüan's gifts helped us set up a cycling team in Gaza," he added. Still, they need more bicycles as their team grows. Another obstacle they face is the ban on travel imposed by Israel. They were invited to three different races but Israel prevented them from traveling to the West Bank and Tunisia. Egypt, which controls a border with Gaza, also prevented them from leaving for Jordan for another competition.
Since 2007, the Gaza Strip has suffered a joint Israeli-Egyptian blockade that has deprived the enclave's roughly 1.9 million inhabitants of their most basic needs, especially food, fuel, medicine and construction supplies. The Gaza Strip largely depends on foreign aid as the economy has stalled under the Israeli blockade.
In the past, some European actors were anti-Turkey, while some others supported it. Those who prioritized rational and strategic thinking had been supporting Turkey and considered Turkish EU membership as one of the main instruments for transforming the organization into a global actor. On the other hand, those who had a civilizational European perspective "otherized" Turkey and strongly opposed its full membership. However, today we have a different picture. The EU governments have been divided into two camps about Turkey-EU relations: All of the governments and political actors are anti-Turkey, however, some of them are blatant while others are disguised.
Turkey-EU relations have almost always been thorny and difficult throughout their history. However, we have been witnessing a paradigm shift in Turkey-EU relations due to recent developments both in the EU and in Turkey. There are two sets of changing conditions that determine this paradigm shift.
The first set of conditions emanate from the EU. The EU institutionalization was at its peak after the collapse of the Cold War system and the EU enlargement toward Eastern Europe. Nevertheless, it faced important challenges stemming from new topics such as defense and foreign policy, and new members. As a result of these developments, the EU has lost its attractiveness for many European states. At last, the British decided to leave the EU. This was the first step back in the EU and most probably this backward tendency will continue. Other member states began to discuss both the future of the EU and their future in the EU.When looked closely, we can see that that there are too many fault lines inside of the EU. The EU faces difficulties in dealing with its domestic problems as well as external challenges. The biggest inner threat to the EU is the rise and normalization of racism, far-right political parties, ultranationalist feelings, xenophobia and Islamophobia. There is an increasingly effective wave of illiberal and anti-globalization actors throughout Europe.
The second inner problem inside of the EU is the shallowness and mediocrity of European politics, that is to say, the new generation of European politicians lack the visionary outlook of the previous generations. They are mostly trapped in conjuncture policies and short-term concerns. That is, they just try to save the day. This new political elite in Europe does not believe in the EU values, and therefore they are hesitant in promoting these values to other countries.
Third, some EU members are reluctant to share the burden of other members. Southern tier EU countries have been experiencing economic problems and struggling against a refugee influx, but the northern tier countries are relatively free of these problems and do not want to import these issues into their domestic politics.
The second set of conditions that has determined the paradigm shift is related with Turkey and its policies. More specifically, Turkey has also been in a process of transformation. Unlike the previous politically dependent and economically vulnerable country, nowadays, Turkey is a politically stronger and economically solid country. In addition to European countries, Turkey has developed a complex network of foreign policy and accordingly improved its relations with Middle Eastern, Asian and African countries. Turkey has normalized relations with its long-time ignored partners and established an Ankara-centered perspective. It has diversified its bilateral relations and redefined its national interests. At this point, European countries were not accustomed to initiating healthy relations with this new Turkey.
The old EU has been trying to continue its hierarchical approach toward Turkey. That is, the EU wants to continue giving instructions to Turkey and to dictate its domestic and foreign policy. With such thinking it becomes clear that the EU failed to accept the new Turkey and it has been following policies that are not only in contradiction with the democratic values that EU "so strongly supports," but directly threaten Turkish national security and interests. Once the biggest and most important motivation of the Turkish democratization process, the EU in recent years began to support anti-democratic actors in Turkey. European countries host members of terrorist groups and provide a safe heaven for coup plotters. European actors have been hesitant in defending democratic institutions against undemocratic forces. EU institutions and members opened their platforms for violent non-state actors and ignored the Turkish warnings and sensitivities. Ironically, European actors still expect from Turkey to take necessary measures in order to protect Europe against detrimental developments such as the refugee problem and international terrorism.
Both the EU and Turkish sides are well aware that the full-membership perspective regarding Turkey-EU relations is lost. After the above mentioned developments, the small chance that used to exist now is totally lost. The two sides need to develop a new type of relationship ‚Äì a realistic, reciprocal, horizontal and strategic perspective. The EU and Turkey are two interdependent actors and it is impossible for them to neglect one another. The two sides have to redefine their bilateral relations and to prioritize a positive agenda, and most importantly, European countries have to stop instrumentalizing Turkey in their respective domestic politics.
Wooing farmers ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Centre on Wednesday hiked the minimum support price for paddy by a record Rs 200 per quintal with Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling it historic and asserting the BJP-led government has fulfilled the poll promise.While Modi said he was happy that the assurance to the farmers of giving MSP at 1.5 times the production cost has been honoured, the Congress sought to debunk his claim, terming it another "jumla" and "electoral lollypop".The CPI(M)-affiliated farmers body All India Kisan Sabha dubbed the MSP hike as "historic betrayal".The decision to hike the MSP of 14 kharif (summer-sown) crops, including paddy, cotton and pulses, was taken by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) meeting chaired by Modi."I am very happy that the promise made by the government to our farmer brothers and sisters of giving minimum support price at 1.5 times the production cost has been fulfilled. There has been a historic increase in the MSP. Congratulations to all farmers," the prime minister tweeted later.The decision is being seen as the BJP's outreach to farmers, who have in recent months held protests in parts of the country against government's policies, with less than a year left for the general elections next year.BJP chief Amit Shah hailed the decision as "historic" and said the move would benefit the farming community in a major way."I want to thank the prime minister and his cabinet colleagues...This is a big decision in the interest of the farmers...This will resolve many problems faced by the farmers," he told reporters in Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh.Accusing the government of "duping" farmers, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said it has not given cost plus 50 per cent to farmers for any crop as was recommended by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP)."The MSP declared today does not fulfil the promise of cost plus 50 per cent of produce If this is not betrayal with farmers, what is it?," he asked.The MSP announced today will be given to farmers next year by when this government will be out of power and another one will pay, he said.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra told a press conference that the hike in MSP underscores Modi's "maximum support for the poor" and will lead to the nation's and farmers' growth.It is a historic move aimed at doubling their income by 2022, he said.
Madrid: Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said on Friday that he was delighted to have two weeks of calm to "refuel" before the Valentine's Day showdown with Paris Saint-Germain (PSG).
Zidane told at a press conference that he wanted his team to find the "necessary intensity" in their play.
"When we have free weeks, like this week and the next, that's the time to refill the tank and work," he said.
Real have two weekend games in La Liga before their Champions League game in Paris: against Levante, who knocked Real out of the Copa del Rey, on Saturday and against Real Sociedad on 10 February.
"The calendar does not benefit us, not at all," Zidane said. "They have their calendar, we have ours, it's like that," Zidane said.
Nevertheless, Zidane did say that Real's easier period gave them the chance to convalesce after a woeful January.
"What's attractive is to have longer training than usual, for example. That's good for stamina," Zidane said. "We have to rediscover, rebuild, and improve our intensity. If we can achieve the necessary intensity for as long as possible over the course of match, we will hurt any opponent, I am convinced of it."
Real are 19 points behind leader Barcelona in La Liga and only has the Champions League to save their season.
Zidane said he was optimistic and "blindly confident" in his squad, which he refused to reinforce the winter transfer window.
"I'm not bothered what happens to me next year, I'm here to think about what I'm doing now and to prepare for Liga matches. People are saying we should fold in La Liga, but I don't think so. In football we must never say never."
Even so, Zidane made clear that the Champions League, which Real have won 12 times, is the target.
"In the Champions League, we are very excited. Real has already won it a lot and we will give everything to win our next match of the Champions League," he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid on Tuesday as 10-year Treasury yields hit the highly anticipated 3 percent mark for the first time in four years, stoking concerns over higher borrowing rates for companies already facing rising costs, and as quarterly results failed to deliver positive outlooks.
The S&P 500 and the Dow fell the most in two-and-a-half weeks, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down for a fifth day in a row. The S&P 500 is now down 1.5 percent year-to-date.
The 10-year yield, a benchmark for global borrowing costs, has been driven steadily higher by a combination of concerns over inflation, growing debt supply and rising Federal Reserve borrowing costs.
"It makes borrowing costs more expensive for corporations. This market rally for the last nine years has been driven by low interest rates, accommodating monetary policy and excess liquidity," said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist for Bruderman Asset Management in New York.
Higher bond yields could also prompt portfolio managers to weigh moving money into more attractive fixed-income securities at the expense of equities. The stock market had already been spooked by a climb in bond yields earlier in the year, sliding sharply in February..
Technology and industrial stocks weighed on the major indexes on Tuesday, with Alphabet Inc , Facebook Inc , 3M Co and Caterpillar Inc all falling more than 3.5 percent.
Alphabet shares fell GOOGL.O;-PCTCHNG:277 percent, erasing the stock's year-to-date gains as rising expenses and shrinking margins overshadowed the company's better-than-expected profit.
Industrial bellwether Caterpillar tumbled CAT;-PCTCHNG:2 percent on fears of increasing steel prices, despite the company's beating earnings estimates due to strong global demand.
Diversified industrial manufacturer 3M was the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Industrial Average . Shares fell MMM;-PCTCHNG:2 percent after the company posted in-line profits as lower taxes offset a miss in operating profits and the company lowered its 2018 earnings forecast.
"We're seeing some of the earnings numbers have come out, and after further review, (investors) realized where all this revenue was coming from," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. "They didn't see it as recurring or indicative of the core business.
"I think what investors had hoped the benefit from taxes would get redeployed back into the company. That's not happening," Nolte said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI;NETCHNG_1,PCTCHNG;[F1<0]fell -F1 points, or -F2 percent,[F1>0]rose F1 points, or F2 percent,[F1=0]remained unchanged to .DJI;TRDPRC_1, the S&P 500 .SPX;NETCHNG_1,PCTCHNG:2;[F1<0]lost -F1 points, or -F2 percent,[F1>0]gained F1 points, or F2 percent,[F1=0]remained unchanged to .SPX;TRDPRC_1 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC;NETCHNG_1:2,PCTCHNG;[F1<0]dropped -F1 points, or -F2 percent,[F1>0]added F1 points, or F2 percent,[F1=0]remained unchanged to .IXIC;TRDPRC_1:2.
Apple Inc shares lost AAPL.O;-PCTCHNG:2 percent as worries over softening demand for high-end smartphones were underscored as Corning Inc reported a drop in screen glass sales for the first time in at least four quarters.
Other technology stocks in the FAANG group, Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc , also weighed on the Nasdaq.
"They're kind of pulling each other down," said Nolte. "Investors are saying, 'You know, the group has had a tremendous run over the last two to three years, maybe we should take some money off the table here.'"
Shares of Lockheed Martin Corp , the Pentagon's largest weapons supplier, dropped LMT;-PCTCHNG:2 percent. The company reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and boosted its full-year sales and profit forecast but did not raise its 2018 cash-flow projections.
So far, 24 percent of S&P 500 companies have reported first-quarter results, with 77.1 percent coming in above the Street consensus, versus the 64 percent average since 1994. Analysts estimate 21.1 percent growth in earnings for the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data.
On the economic front, U.S. consumer confidence rebounded in April, according to the Conference Board, as short-term optimism improved and the share of consumers expecting their incomes to decline in the coming months hit its lowest level since December 2000.
Oil rose above $75 a barrel to its highest level since November 2014, but then reversed course as U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron pledged to try to resolve U.S.-European differences on Iran, easing concerns that the United States might reinstate sanctions against Iran.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.94-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.71-to-1 ratio favoured decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 21 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 61 new highs and 90 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.22 billion shares, compared to the 6.80 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

After paving into the FMCG sector, then dipping toes in telecom recently with the Patanjali SIM, Yoga guru Baba Ramdev has now entered the digital sector with the launch of a ‚Äòswadeshi' version of WhatsApp, or what they like to call, the Kimbho app.
The app, which is being called the Bharat first messaging app, was launched on 30 May in New Delhi. Patanjali spokesperson SK Tijarawala tweeted that the app is a #SwadeshiMessagingPlatform. According to him, Kimbho is a Sanskrit word which means ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù
So they literally looked up what 'What's up' is called in Sanskrit? Great!
We took a look at the app and cannot help but notice its similarities to WhatsApp. To begin with, the logo is pretty much the same as WhatsApp's. Except the telephone icon in the middle of the chat bubbles in WhatsApp, Kimbho's logo has a conch in that chat bubble, assuming that is how people would call each other in the ancient ages. Though Kimbho is entirely different in terms of the shade green they have used in the logo, a lot punchy and brighter, we must say.
Entering the app, the registration is quite basic like every other platform, you add your number and verify using an OTP sent by Kimbho. After that, all your saved contacts appear in your contact list. Since it is in the beta stage (beta 0.95), it could be missing some details required for messaging apps.
The app's homepage has three tabs: Chats, Contacts, Activity. In Chat, your chats with your contacts will appear. In the Contacts section, there are contacts and three other features. These include Create New Group, Broadcast Lists, Follow Celebrities, and Kimbho Team.
While the former two are similar to WhatsApp, Follow Celebrities page is empty, one can assume it to be like Instagram or Twitter where users can explore follow celebrities accounts. Finally, there is Kimbho Team where users can seek help regarding the app.
As of now, users are free to send messages to their friends even if they are not a part of the Kimbho, which is quite a strange. Inside the chat, you can see various options. It includes Quickies (quite a name!), shortcut to Gallery, stickers, voice recorder, and paint. In stickers, there are three sets of stickers. It includes funny caricatures of young aged man, an old middle-aged man and a middle-aged woman.
In the Quickies section, there is a list of questionable intuitive messages. It includes suggestions like Namaste, Ram Ram, You know what I mean, Good Luck and many others.
In the app's third section is the activity section, where users can get updates about the activities of their friends, and is expected to be different from the chat section somehow.
You can change your profile pictures and use the already fed pictures in Kimbho, or Gallery, or via camera.
It also has a paint section, above three apps, near settings. This has different objects to write which include a quill, pencil, pen, and a paint brush.
Since the app is still in beta stage, features like VoIP and video calls are yet to be a part of the system.
However, the biggest question is privacy. The Kimbho team claims that ‚ÄúEvery message is end-to-end encrypted and secured by (Advanced Encryption Standard)". French security researcher, Elliot Anderson has already tweeted his reservations about the app.
Ok, I will stop here. The #Kimbho #android #app is a security disaster. I can access the messages of all the users...‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ‚Äî Elliot Alderson (@fs0c131y) May 30, 2018
The researcher also claims that the app is a blatant copy of an existing messaging app.
The @KimbhoApp is a copy and paste of another #application. The description and the screenshots in the app stores are the same. Moreover, the #Kimbho app is making request to bolomessenger[.]com pic.twitter.com/gOKOhash5X ‚Äî Elliot Alderson (@fs0c131y) May 31, 2018
The launch of Kimbho has led to a flood of reactions on Twitter.
With #KIMBHO one thing is clear that Ramdev is in full mood to come up with Indian version of Tinder called #SAMBHOG
‚Äî Ritik Kalra (@ritikkalra) May 30, 2018
I'm alive to witness the launch of new planet by Baba#Kimbho ‚Äî DG (@Dhirajgawande) May 30, 2018
I hope #KIMBHO will not ask me link my adhar card ‚Äî Bidita Bag (@biditabag) May 30, 2018 The irony here, Baba Ramdev's app #Kimbho features callers from outside India, showing kids playing football with location shared of Fremont, CA. Also, the mobile carrier is AT&T pic.twitter.com/9STANgERfe ‚Äî Akshay (@TheWrenchMate) May 30, 2018
The official version of the app is yet to be seen in full swing. Ram Ram!
Kevin Winter/Getty ImagesThis Friday will mark one year since Prince's untimely death, but only now are we learning new details surrounding the music icon and the drug use that killed him, thanks to investigative records unsealed Monday.
One revelation: in April of 2016, on the day Prince's private plane landed in Moline, IL for a medical emergency, a Minnesota doctor named Todd Schulenberg prescribed oxycodone for the singer but put the prescription in the name of Prince's longtime friend and bodyguard, Kirk Johnson, ‚Äúfor Prince's privacy.‚Äù
The documents also show the extent to which detectives went to track down the source of the synthetic fentanyl that an autopsy determined was the drug that killed Prince.
Investigators searched Prince's Paisley Park residence and recording studio, scoured an Apple laptop computer in his bedroom, and examined email accounts and phone records. Even so, nothing suggests they're any closer to determining where Prince obtained the fentanyl.
The records also describe a large quantity of narcotics scattered throughout Paisley Park, despite Prince's reputation as being vehemently anti-drug.
‚ÄúThere was a sizable amount of narcotic medications located inside Paisley Park,‚Äù one document said. ‚ÄúMany of those areas where the pills were located would be places Prince would frequent, such as his bedroom and wardrobe/laundry room.‚Äù
The pills weren't stored in typical prescription bottles, but in ‚Äúvarious other containers such as vitamin bottles.‚Äù Prince also had not been prescribed any of the controlled substances found in his home, the documents reveal.
Also, associates interviewed by detectives said Prince had a history of going through withdrawals, which were believed to be the result of his abuse of prescription medication.

The first year of my kids' lives is kind of a blur. When I look at their baby pictures the majority of my new-mom moments sort of blend together. It's not that my kids weren't amazing, or that I didn't love them, it's just that I was utterly exhausted. Fortunately, I came to realize that every single day, in little ways, my babies all tried to tell me to take a break. I actually learned to take every single one of my little ones up on their offers, too.
Now that I have been through that grueling first year of mom life more than once, I've realized that it does get incrementally easier. Eventually your babies don't need you to touch them, hold them, or feed them 24 hours a day. And when it seems like they still need more than you can give, you learn to recognize the subtle ways they're trying to tell to relax. As a result, you realize you can take a moment to breathe, take a shower, change your shirt, or drink a cup of coffee while it's still hot.
I've also learned the hard way that we, as moms, have got to start taking breaks. After 40 weeks (more or less) of pregnancy, an untold number of hours of labor and delivery, and postpartum life, we deserve it and we shouldn't feel guilty for not losing ourselves to motherhood. At the capacity that we care for our children it's impossible to keep up with their needs if you are burnt out, exhausted, or sick. Eventually something has to give, and in my experience it's usually self-care. It doesn't have to be that way, though, and even our babies are trying to tell us to prioritize our health and wellness.
When They Let You Put Them Down I pretty much held my daughter constantly for her first three months of her life. I didn't realize that I could put her down, and I, honestly, didn't want to. I needed to, though, so she could learn to sleep, play, and be OK without touching me all day long. Once she started letting me put her down, I actually got stuff done and was able to enjoy a break here or there.
When They Finally Fall Asleep Giphy My babies have all been crappy sleepers, so I kind of got in the habit of staying awake way too late or waking up multiple times in the middle of the night. I also learned that even a little sleep is worth having when you are an exhausted new mom. So when your little one finally enjoys eight hours, they're silently begging you to do the same.
When They Sit Calmly On Their Own Without Touching You As a new mom it was so hard to let my babies be alone on their mat or in their swing. But seeing them stay calm, or even smile, and hearing them chatter or coo, let me know that they would be just fine if I checked Facebook from across the room.
When They Let Someone Else Hold Them Giphy Speaking of holding babies, my youngest babies definitely had a preference for me. It was cute, sure, but it was also exhausting. Once they started letting my husband, mom, or babysitter hold them, it was so wonderful. I mean, I could actually leave the room without hearing them cry and you know, pee by myself.
When They Finally Stop Crying Hearing your baby cry makes you feel so helpless. Like, you are willing to do anything to help calm them down. When they finally stop, though, they are sending you a clear message.
When You Successfully Put Them Down In Their Crib Giphy Transferring a baby from your arms or their carseat to their crib without waking them up is pretty much expert-level parenting. Nothing says "you deserve a glass of wine" like your baby staying asleep while you back out of the nursery and close the door.
When They Play Independently Courtesy of Steph Montgomery At some point, my babies all started to sit with toys and play by themselves. OMG it was so amazing to realize that I didn't have to entertain them all day long.
When They Self-Soothe Sleep-training, in my experience, involves a few days of unbearable anxiety, followed by a lifetime of having a short break every single evening. When my baby started falling asleep on his own without being fed, rocked, or held, it was kind of shocking. I wish I had sleep-trained my older kids, honestly.

: A British Muslim man was Friday sentenced to six years' imprisonment by a UK court for showing an Islamic State (ISIS) beheading video to schoolchildren.Zameer Ghumra was found guilty of disseminating terrorist propaganda and trying to brainwash young boys into supporting ISIS at Nottingham Crown Court Friday.The 38-year-old pharmacist, believed to be of Arabic origin, also told the children they should kill anyone who insulted Islam and instructed them to make only Muslim friends."These were shocking crimes which damaged the children and caused offence to the vast majority of law-abiding Muslims," Judge Gregory Dickson said.The judge also noted the lack of remorse shown by Ghumra during his trial when determining his sentence. The jury was told that the children, who came in contact with the accused at a madrassa he had set up, were encouraged to go to Syria to fight with the ISIS where they would have to behead people.Ghumra also followed various ISIS-linked social media accounts and made the two children follow similar accounts. Prosecutor Simon Davis said Ghumra had told a customer that ISIS were "not bad people they're only defending themselves".Ghumra, from the city of Leicester, was working as a pharmacist in Oundle, Northamptonshire, when he was arrested at Birmingham Airport in September 2015.He had denied the charges and claimed that the children had been induced to make "false allegations" against him. Sue Hemming of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said: "Zameer Ghumra tried to brainwash impressionable children with this violent ideology by making one watch beheading videos and urging them both to adopt a hard line religious outlook.""The CPS case was that he intended to radicalise them in the hope that they would go on to be involved in terrorism."The children were brave to give evidence and we would like to thank them for helping to secure this conviction of a dangerous man," Hemming said.Ghumra was found guilty of the charge of disseminating "terrorist propaganda" in the form of a graphic Twitter video on his mobile phone between January 2013 and September 2014.Detective Chief Superintendent Martin Snowden, head of Counterterrorism Policing North East, said: "That act alone is unforgivable. His teaching role increases his risk, potentially giving him direct access to young or vulnerable people who may look up to him as an authority figure."
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea violated United Nations sanctions to earn nearly $200 million in 2017 from banned commodity exports, according to a confidential report by independent U.N. monitors, which also accused Pyongyang of supplying weapons to Syria and Myanmar.
The report to a U.N. Security Council sanctions committee, seen by Reuters on Friday, said North Korea had shipped coal to ports, including in Russia, China, South Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam, mainly using false paperwork that showed countries such as Russia and China as the coal origin, instead of North Korea.
The 15-member council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, banning exports including coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood, and capping imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products.
‚ÄúThe DPRK (North Korea) is already flouting the most recent resolutions by exploiting global oil supply chains, complicit foreign nationals, offshore company registries and the international banking system,‚Äù the U.N. monitors wrote in the 213-page report.
The North Korean mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. report. Russia and China have repeatedly said they are implementing U.N. sanctions on North Korea.
SYRIA, MYANMAR
The monitors said they had investigated ongoing ballistic missile cooperation between Syria and Myanmar, including more than 40 previously unreported North Korea shipments between 2012 and 2017 to Syria's Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which oversees the country's chemical weapons program.
The investigation has shown ‚Äúfurther evidence of arms embargo and other violations, including through the transfer of items with utility in ballistic missile and chemical weapons programs,‚Äù the U.N. monitors wrote.
They also inspected cargo from two North Korea shipments intercepted by unidentified countries en route to Syria. Both contained acid-resistant tiles that could cover an area equal to a large scale industrial project, the monitors reported.
One country, which was not identified, told the monitors the seized shipments can ‚Äúbe used to build bricks for the interior wall of a chemical factory.‚Äù
Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013. However, diplomats and weapons inspectors suspect Syria may have secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability.
The Syrian mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. report.
The U.N. monitors also said one country, which they did not identify, reported it had evidence that Myanmar received ballistic missile systems from North Korea, along with conventional weapons, including multiple rocket launchers and surface-to-air missiles.
Myanmar U.N. Ambassador Hau Do Suan said the Myanmar government ‚Äúhas no ongoing arms relationship, whatsoever, with North Korea‚Äù and is abiding by the U.N. Security Council resolutions.
BANNED EXPORTS, IMPORTS
Under a 2016 resolution, the U.N. Security Council capped coal exports and required countries to report any imports of North Korean coal to the council sanctions committee. It then banned all exports of coal by North Korea on Aug. 5.
The U.N. monitors investigated 16 coal shipments between January and Aug. 5 to ports in Russia, China, Malaysia and Vietnam. They said Malaysia reported one shipment to the council committee and the remaining 15 shipments violated sanctions.
After the coal ban was imposed on Aug. 5, the U.N. monitors investigated 23 coal shipments to ports in Russia, China, South Korea and Vietnam. The U.N. monitors said all those shipments ‚Äúwould constitute a violation of the resolution, if confirmed.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe DPRK combined deceptive navigation patterns, signals manipulation, transshipments as well as fraudulent documentation to obscure the origin of the coal,‚Äù the monitors said.
The U.N. monitors ‚Äúalso investigated cases of ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products in violation (of U.N. sanctions) ... and found that the network behind these vessels is primarily based in Taiwan province of China.‚Äù
The monitors said one country, which they did not name, told them North Korea had carried out such transfers off its ports of Wonsan and Nampo and in international waters between the Yellow Sea and East China Sea between October and January.
The report said several multinational oil companies, which were not named, were also being investigated for roles in the supply chain of petroleum products transferred to North Korea.
Washington: Several hundred highly-skilled Indian workers, in long agonising green card wait, along with their children and spouses held a rally in front of the White House in Washington in support of President Donald Trump's plan for a merit-based immigration system that among other things ends chain migration and diversity lottery visa.
Flying to the US capital from as far as California, Texas and Chicago and driving several hundred miles from places like Florida, New York and Massachusetts, these highly skilled Indians, living in the US for the past several years and in many cases for more than a decade, urged Trump to end the per country limit on legal permanent residency so as to eliminate the massive Green Card backlog of highly skilled Indians.
"We are looking strictly for a merit-based immigration. That will bring prosperity and fast economic growth of the US," Krishna Bansal, national policy and political director of Republican Hindu Coalition, told the rally of highly skilled Indians, who want to make the US now their permanent home.
"We are with President Trump for taking initiative towards a merit-based immigration system," Bansal said, adding that his group is working with the White House and lawmakers towards a comprehensive immigration bill that should include all these things.
Giving green cards to thousands of highly skilled professionals from India would help them realise their full potential and boost country's growth and prosperity, he said.
The participants, many of them software engineers, at Saturday's rally had banner and posters with slogans like 'Cut Green Card backlog', 'strictly merit-based point system', 'end country limit', 'we need to support legal dreamers', and 'We support Trump.'
This was one of the rare pro-Trump immigration rallies at the White House.
"Green Card backlogs have been taunting most High Skilled Immigrants who have come to this country for a better life. The wait expectancy for a Green Card for a High Skilled immigrant from India tends to be somewhat from 12 Years to 70+ Years, when most of the world can get their Green Card in less than 2 years," said Akshita Ramesh, 13, a student of Ronald Reagan Middle School in Virginia.
Thanjavur-born, Akshita was one and half year old when she moved to the US along with her father Ramesh Ranathan, who is in the IT profession and had a H-1B visa.
Describing herself as legal H-4 dreamer, Akshita said the current green card waiting period for Indians means that her parents are unlikely to get legal permanent residency for next few decades.
"I have always known I was born in India, and that I was on H4 Visa with my dad having an approved petition to apply for Green Card, but I didn't know about everything to the full extent. I didn't know that being on a H4 could mean that it will be much harder for colleges to accept me, no matter how good my grades are," she said.
"I didn't know that having a H4 until 21 would mean possibly getting pretty much 'kicked out' of the US, the only home I've ever known, the land that I felt all the happiness of achievement, and the burning anger of disappointment," Akshita said in a passionate plea.
"And all of this just because I was born in a different country that I barely even lived in? Don't you think that's unfair?" she said, adding that she feels that her dreams would be shattered.
"It sounds scary when I think the day I would turn 21, I would be made to feel a bit like an outcast, or a misfit in the country that I grew up in, how would you feel if you were the only one kid in an area who will be stamped as an alien, a foreigner when you turn 21, even though you've lived in the country your whole life?" she asked.
"I urge all lawmakers and the President to hear me and support us in every way you can to solve the backlogs ASAP, and guarantee that this problem is solved once and for all, and no single ambitious kid and parent will have to go through the same scenario as me," Akshita said.
According to Republican Hindu Coalition, there are nearly 2,00,000 children of legal immigrants-in-line from India, who have never broken the law, but who simply age out at 21 and have to go back, because their parents have a 60 year wait to get their green card after it is approved.
"US Economy if it was to grow four per cent per year will need another 4,00,000 high-skilled workers added to the work force each year. Immigration reform needs to address this issue as well. The Hindu and Indian community has some anxiety related to Immigration issues," said Anil Sharma a member of the organizing team.
Souptik Mukherjee, another member, said that for the high skilled professional with advanced degrees the green card wait seems to be endless. "Any initiative to move towards a merit-based immigration system is highly laudable."

The post is captioned, ‚ÄúHello 2017‚Ä¶‚Äù In the video, a silent Ed sits on a couch and holds up a handwritten sign that features his message, which simply reads, ‚ÄúNew music coming Friday!!‚Äù
Ed smiles, waves and puts the sign in his mouth before the clip cuts out.
The singer has been on a musical hiatus for about a year. Last month, Ed returned to social media by changing his profile pic to a blue-colored square. Many speculated it has something to do with his new music.

California's bar exam is notoriously difficult. Or, more to the point, it's notoriously difficult to pass, which is not quite the same thing. The questions that prospective lawyers must answer aren't necessarily harder here than those on other states' exams, but the grading is tougher. It's as if you only have to get a C+ to be an attorney in Illinois, but you need an A- in California. Fewer than half the would-be lawyers who took the test here in the last three years passed it.
That might be OK if it meant that California's attorneys were more competent, and the public better protected against poor lawyering, than in other states. But there is no evidence to support any such contention. The pass rate, as set by the state, is relatively arbitrary.
The low pass rate would make sense if it turned out that fewer California test-takers were as capable or as prepared as their counterparts in other states. But that doesn't appear to be the case either. The average California score on the multiple choice portion ‚Äî the one part of the bar exam that is identical in most states ‚Äî is higher than the national average.
An exam that significantly, if artificially, depresses the number of new attorneys each year might nevertheless have some appeal in a society that harbors at best a mixed level of enthusiasm about lawyers. So we have fewer of them than we might otherwise. Is that such a bad thing?
California and its residents have been poorly served by an unusually high bar exam cut score.
But there are indeed negative ramifications. It means California's legal establishment is more exclusive than those in other jurisdictions, leaving out people who in almost any other state (only Delaware's exam is as restrictive as California's) could provide highly competent counsel to those who need it.
More specifically, the unusually high cut score ‚Äî the term that the testing establishment gives to the line that separates those who pass from those who don't ‚Äî means California's bar is disproportionately white.
A study of the July 2016 exam showed that reducing California's cut score from 1440 to the national median of 1350 would have increased the number of successful African American exam-takers by 113%. There would have been a 75% increase in success for Latinos, and 58% for Asians. Of course more white exam-takers would have passed using the national median as well ‚Äì 42% more. But the ranks of lawyers in this state would have been a bit more representative of the population that enters and graduates from law school, and the population of clients who need legal counsel.
Again, there is no evidence to suggest that lawyers in states with somewhat lower cut scores ‚Äî including New York, where the line is set at 1330 ‚Äî are any less competent than those in California. Once an applicant clears the bar that (somewhat arbitrarily) delineates minimum acceptable competence, ever-higher scores don't appear to guarantee ever-finer attorneys or, to put it another way, better-served clients and public. It is noteworthy that California has long had something that the legal establishment calls a ‚Äúunified bar‚Äù ‚Äî meaning that the same agency responsible for licensing and disciplining attorneys just also happened to be the lawyers' biggest trade association. This made for something of a conflict of interest. Attorneys would argue that they have a role in keeping professional standards high, and that may be true ‚Äî but they also have a clear interest in keeping their numbers low. One way to accomplish that is to make the exam unreasonably difficult for would-be competitors to pass. That makes the exam more of an artificial barrier to entry, and a sort of hazing ritual, than a test of competence.
Things are about to change. Gov. Jerry Brown on Monday signed a bill to make the State Bar a strictly regulatory agency while spinning off the trade association into a private nonprofit. It's a good step but will not by itself solve the problem of undue exclusivity that is caused by the bar exam's atypical cut score.
Ultimately, it is the state Supreme Court that will decide this question. It is considering how to respond to a demand by the deans of most of the state's largest accredited law schools to lower the score to something closer to the national mean.
The deans are right. California and its residents have been poorly served by an unusually high bar exam cut score. The court would be wise to adjust the cut score to something closer to the national average ‚Äî and perhaps then commission a study to determine whether an exam based on early 20th-century methodologies actually determines a person's fitness to practice law at all.

Laura Prepon and fianc√© Ben Foster welcomed their first daughter last summer, but it hasn't changed the actress' outlook on balancing both her career and motherhood. She's currently directing and starring in shows like Orange Is the New Black and most recently penned her first health and wellness book, The Stash Plan. However, Laura Prepon's message about being a working mom is perhaps her best advice yet, and it's an important reminder for new parents about why they shouldn't give (or feel the need to give) work a negative connotation.
Appearing on a recent segment of The MOMS to talk about her new book, as People reported, Prepon shared a little bit about what it's like to be a working parent. ‚ÄúBen and I are really great about if I'm at work, he's [at home], and if he's at work, I'm [at home],‚Äù she said during the segment, according to People. ‚Äú[But] I do feel guilty, and I just know that she'd be proud if she knew. I've talked to a bunch of women [asking], ‚ÄòHow do you do this?' And they're just like, ‚ÄòThere's really no solution. You just do it.'"
She went on to say that it's really important not to give work a negative connotation. As per the advice of a friend, Prepon shared that she learned that when she's communicating to her daughter that she has to leave for work, she does it in a positive way so as to develop a healthier perspective on it. "If you make it like, ‚ÄòUgh, I gotta go to work, that sucks,' it's negative," she said. "You never want that.‚Äù
Prepon and Foster ‚Äî who have known each other for over 18 years ‚Äî got engaged in October 2016, as People reported. They welcomed their daughter, Ella, 10 months later (Prepon only recently revealed her baby's name on the aforementioned episode of The MOMS). She's offered her fans glimpses of what she experienced with her pregnancy, and how she's learning the ins and outs of new motherhood.
In November, for example, she shared photos of herself struggling to set up her daughter's crib and saying: ‚ÄúHaving a little trouble with the new crib‚Ä¶ Any tips on traveling with a newborn so I can avoid stuff like this?! #MomTipMonday." If that wasn't relatable enough, as Us Weekly reported, she also said that she started craving foods from her childhood when she got pregnant:
[My father] was a doctor and when he would have a break we would go to this Jewish deli. We would get this pastrami on rye sandwich with a Dr. Brown's black cherry soda. When I was a kid that's what we would get with my dad. With like mustard and sauerkraut. What's so funny is I have not eaten that stuff probably since I was a kid with my dad. So when I got pregnant all of a sudden I was like: "I need a pastrami on rye. I need a Dr. Brown's black cherry soda. I need mustard and sauerkraut." These crazy Jewish deli cravings hit me so hard.

It's refreshing to hear celebrities be so candid about such relatable topics, especially when it comes to balancing work and parenthood. Drew Barrymore, for instance, also shared a similar sentiment with Working Mother recently, saying:
Sometimes I feel like the two are pulling in different directions, and I feel really torn and freaked out in my head and my heart and kind of all over the place. I think there are a lot of days where I feel like, "Good, I took care of work stuff, now I can focus solely on my kids," and I'm revitalized by work to just go and be a mom and nothing but a mom... It makes me feel reenergized. I think if you did nothing but work, you'd be exhausted and resent work. And if you do nothing but [be with] your children, you'd be exhausted by that. It is a balance.
It's clear that celebs like Barrymore and Prepon have an abundance of wisdom to share, and though they're figuring it out as they go (like anyone else) they're definitely right about making sure that you take care of yourself physically and mentally, and still prioritize your own goals, even when your life has changed after you become a mom.

I'm not attractive enough. I'm not fishing, I'm being honest. When you do those roles, and I've done a few and really got a lot out of portraying those characters," McAvoy told Heat magazine."But in the back of your mind is the niggling doubt, 'Is anyone going to believe this beautiful woman is going to fall in love with someone who looks like me?'

(Reuters) - More than half of patients with advanced multiple myeloma who had run out of therapeutic options remained in complete remission after receiving bluebird bio Inc's experimental gene-modifying immunotherapy in a small, early stage study, according to updated data released on Sunday.
Of 18 patients who received a therapeutic dose of bb2121, all but one responded to the treatment, a 94 percent response rate, while 56 percent remained in remission with a median follow-up of 40 weeks after treatment.
Researchers, who reported the data at the American Society of Hematology meeting in Atlanta, said the initial response to the treatment was very quick and that many of the patients continued to improve over time.
Patients in the Phase I dose-escalation study had received seven prior treatment regimens, including regimens with the newest multiple myeloma drugs, such as Johnson & Johnson's Darzalex, and had undergone at least one stem cell transplant before receiving bb2121, which is being co-developed with Celgene Corp.
‚ÄúSome of these patients were going to hospice until they got this,‚Äù said Dr. Jesus Berdeja, the study's lead investigator.
‚ÄúThis is unheard of, something that we haven't seen with any drugs approved for myeloma in this type of population. The excitement among all the myeloma providers is crazy,‚Äù said Berdeja, director of myeloma research at the Sarah Cannon Center for Blood Cancer in Nashville.
bb2121 belongs to a potentially revolutionary new type of one-time treatment called CAR-T therapy that involves genetic manipulation of a patient's immune system. A patient's own disease-fighting T-cells are harvested and genetically reengineered to target specific proteins on cancer cells before being replaced so they can circulate seeking out and attacking the cancer, possibly for years.
The first two CAR-T therapies from Novartis and Gilead Sciences, through its acquisition of Kite Pharma, were approved earlier this year for other blood cancers.
Three patients who received what proved to be sub-optimal doses of cells early in the bb2121 study died. Of the 18 who received higher doses, four patients have now experienced disease progression, while 14 continue to respond, researchers reported.
The treatment was very well tolerated for a CAR-T product, Berdeja said.
Only two patients experienced serious cytokine release syndrome with no reports of serious brain toxicity, both common side effects of CAR-T treatment. The most serious side effect was neutropenia, or very low white blood cell count, researchers said.
While this was a small Phase I study, the results were considered so impressive that Celgene plans to begin enrolling patients this month for a larger, potentially pivotal trial that could position bb2121 to become the third approved CAR-T.
‚ÄúThey're hitting it so far out of the park that they're not wasting any time,‚Äù Berdeja said.
Cristiano Ronaldo has received an offer to leave Real Madrid and join Italian champions Juventus, a source close to the player told Reuters on Wednesday.Ronaldo, who joined Real from Manchester United in 2008 for a then world record 80 million pounds ($105.65 million), is the Spanish club's all-time top scorer with 451 goals in all competitions and has won two La Liga titles and four Champions League trophies with them.Despite the glut of silverware, however, the five-times world player of the year has had frequent fallouts with Real and has declared on several occasions that he wants to leave the club.Moments after lifting a third consecutive Champions League trophy by beating Liverpool 3-1 in the final on May 26, Ronaldo appeared to suggest he had already decided to leave Real, telling a television reporter on the pitch at Kiev's NSC Olympic Stadium: "It was beautiful to play for Real Madrid."Ronaldo, 33, appeared to backtrack on that statement during Real's celebration parade through the Spanish capital the next day, when he told a mass of supporters: "See you next season."The Portugal forward was reported to be on the verge of leaving last June after a news story appeared in Portuguese newspaper Record declaring he was unhappy with the club.He also caused a stir in 2012 when he declared in a post-match interview after a game with Granada: "I'm sad and the club know why."Spanish newspaper Marca suggested on Wednesday that Ronaldo is unhappy at Real because they are searching for a successor to him and president Florentino Perez has publicly courted Paris St Germain forward Neymar, urging the Brazilian last year to come to Madrid if he wants to win the prestigious Ballon d'Or award.Ronaldo scored two goals against Juventus in Real's 4-1 win in the 2017 Champions League and struck a jaw-dropping bicycle kick against the Italians in a 3-0 win in a quarter-final first leg game in Turin which prompted Juve supporters to give him a standing ovation.The Portuguese converted a stoppage-time penalty in the second leg to knock the Italians out 4-3 on aggregate.Ronaldo had an explosive start to the 2018 World Cup by scoring a hat-trick in his side's 3-3 draw with Spain and he hit the winning goal in a 1-0 win over Morocco. He missed a penalty in a 1-1 draw with Iran and failed to score in his side's 2-1 defeat by Uruguay in the last 16.
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) ‚Äî We are officially one week away from arguably the biggest celestial event of the century.
In West Michigan, here is what you need to know to get ready for the Aug. 21 solar eclipse.
WHAT WILL IT LOOK LIKE HERE
Michigan is outside of the path of totality, which means the sun won't be fully blocked by the moon during the eclipse. Depending on where you live in West Michigan, the sun will be 75 percent to 85 percent covered during peak eclipse time, which will take place in the Eastern time zone from 2:10 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. Google has created a simulator that allows you see what the eclipse will look like depending on location. You can view that simulator by clicking or tapping here.
WITHOUT PROTECTION, THE ECLIPSE IN WEST MICHIGAN WON'T BE SAFE TO VIEW
Here in West Michigan the sun will never be completely covered by the moon. That is why is essential to protect your eyes if you plan on watching the eclipse first-hand. Cities and towns that are in the path of totality will have roughly a 2-minute window to watch the eclipse without glasses.
During totality, the sun's light is blocked out, making it safe to stare. Even though a big chunk of the sun will be covered in West Michigan during the eclipse, there will still be enough sunlight to cause major eye problems if you risk anything more than a glimpse unprotected. Sunglasses are not safe. Eye problems may not be apparent immediately after staring at the sun. Experts say blindness or vision problems may not appear for hours or even a day after the damage has been done.
Pinhole projection is a great way to watch the eclipse without looking at the sun at all. The smaller the hole in a pinhole projector, the better the shadow will be. Leaves can be used as a cheap and beautiful way to watch the eclipse. The shadows cast by the leaves will each turn into mini-projectors, with crescent cuts taken out of them as the eclipse peaks.
LIST OF SAFE ECLIPSE GLASSES
In the mad rush for eclipse glasses, imposters are popping up and they could do damage to your eyes. In West Michigan, you may still be able to find a pair or two at Walmart, Lowes, libraries or the Grand Rapids Public Museum.
Here is a list of safe glasses by the American Astronomical Society. See a list of reputable sellers by clicking or tapping here.
RECORDING VIDEO OF THE ECLIPSE WITH YOUR CAMERA PHONE COULD DAMAGE IT
Quick pictures of the sun during the eclipse should be fine with your phone, but extended use during the solar eclipse could permanently damage it. There is an ongoing debate as to how much damage a phone will sustain if it is used extensively during the eclipse. Click or tap here for the complete argument from NASA.
THINKING OF HEADING TO THE PATH OF TOTALITY?
The path of totality is roughly 400 miles away from us here in West Michigan. If you are planning on making last-minute travel plans to see the eclipse, expect to find expensive hotel costs or no vacancies. Traffic is expected to gridlock in major cities and areas during the eclipse with limited water and bathroom options in the most popular areas.
The next time a total solar eclipse is expected to cut across America with such an extensive path of visibility is April 8, 2024. That path of totality will cross much closer to us in Michigan than the upcoming August eclipse.

Kim Kardashian West is planning on visiting the White House Wednesday in a bid to free 62-year-old great-grandmother Alice Marie Johnson, who's been locked up in prison for 21 years on a first-time drug offence.
Kardashian West, 37, is expected to sit down for a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and his senior adviser Jared Kushner to discuss prison reform. The meeting is scheduled to take place before 4 p.m. ET, and the trio will likely gather in the Oval Office.

Johnson's story was first brought to Kardashian's attention via Twitter, and she previously told Micthat she'd been ‚Äúin communication with the White House‚Äù to also make them aware of her.
This is so unfair‚Ä¶ https://t.co/W3lPINbQuy ‚Äî Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) October 26, 2017
She explained, ‚Äú[I'm] trying to bring her case to the president's desk and figure out how we can get her out. That's such a huge step from where we started with that not even being on their radar. If you think about a decision that you've made in your life and you get life without the possibility of parole for your first-time non-violent offence, there's just something so wrong with that.‚Äù
Johnson is currently serving life behind bars at the Aliceville Federal Correctional Institution in Alabama.
The meeting will take place following two American criminal justice developments at the White House over the last few weeks.

First, Trump granted a posthumous pardon to former boxing heavyweight champion Jack Johnson ‚Äî the first black man to achieve that status ‚Äî after his great-great niece and movie star Sylvester Stallone submitted pleas.
Secondly, the House approved the First Step Act, a legislative proposition of Kushner's, which allows more prisoners to serve sentences in halfway houses and funds support programs to prevent recidivism.
Reports say that Kardashian West's lawyer, Shawn Holley, would be joining Trump, the reality TV star and Kushner on Wednesday afternoon. Sources also say that Kardashian West would be making the trip without the Keeping Up with the Kardashians cameras.
According to the Prison Police Initiative, 2.3 million Americans are currently being held in correctional facilities, and 1 in 5 of those incarcerated people are locked up for drug offences.

U.S. President Donald Trump supports the goal of peace between Israel and the Palestinians, even if it does not involve the two-state solution, a senior White House official said on Tuesday.
Speaking a day before Trump holds a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the official said peace was the ultimate goal.
"Whether that comes in the form of a two‚Äìstate solution if that's what the parties want, or something else," the official said, adding that Trump would not try to "dictate" a solution.
Failure by a U.S. president to explicitly back a two-state solution would upend decades of U.S. policy embraced by Republican and Democratic administrations. It has long been the bedrock U.S. position for resolving the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has been at the core of international peace efforts.
Any sign of a softening of U.S. support for eventual Palestinian statehood could also anger the Muslim world, including Sunni Arab allies, which the Trump administration needs in the fight against Islamic State and to back efforts against Shi'ite Iran.
Trump considers Middle East peace a "high priority," the White House official said. The president has given his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the job of negotiating a peace deal.
"We would want to work on it very quickly," the official said.
Trump's choice for U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who has not yet been confirmed by the Senate, will not be involved in the president's discussions with Netanyahu on Wednesday, the official said.
Friedman advocates settlement building and has questioned the two-state solution.
The White House said earlier this month that Israel's building of new settlements or expansion of existing ones in occupied territories may not be helpful in achieving peace.
The statement was a shift in tone for Trump, who signaled during the campaign that he could be more accommodating toward settlement projects than his predecessor, Barack Obama.
For this week, I would like to continue the cocktail machine project which I had started it from the first week (http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/cocktail-machine.html). I would like this machine to be more immersive and gives new experiences as well as bring social connections between participants. I've been looking at the olfactory experience as the smell is one of the most important aspects to enhance a taste of cocktails.
The first project that I looked at is AlcoholicArchitecture by Bompas and Parr. This project offers a new unique experience of enjoying cocktails. They create a breathable cloud-like cocktail in the space where people can inhale or taste the cocktails by their tongue.
(Fig.1 AlcoholicArchitecture by Bompas and Parr)
(Fig2. Scent Drops at Grand Museum of Perfume in Paris by Harvey & John)
The next project, Scent Drops, is in Grand Museum of Perfume in Paris, As you can see from fig.2, Participants will lift off the copper balls which contain natural sources of fragrances like jasmine, orange blossoms and smell the scent of ingredients inside. Following this, participants can listen to the explanation about the particular ingredient from a speaker inside the balls.
(Fig3. collected smells by Smell Lab)
Smell Lab in Berlin has done several projects that experiment on the sense of smell, olfaction in general and fragrance. The first project that they've done is collected smells which is the installation made up of sheets of cloth imbued with scents from the surroundings in Berlin, for example, water, soil, cigarette smoke. Then they have participants to smell then describe and try to guess what the smells are and also discuss if the smells remind them of the city.
For the cocktail machine project, there is great potential to integrate olfactory experience and use it as a tool to encourage people to participate and express their preferences which will be a representation of them in the collaboration. To elaborate, there would be twelve or more of beverages. Participants will be able to choose the beverage they like by smelling it then they would control the interface to distribute the ones they like to make a collaborative cocktail together. In this way, participants will feel like they are a part of a collaboration and as the beverages they choose will be a kind of their representation to the collaboration. Therefore, I believe, the outcome which is the collaborative cocktails will give a sense of ownership to them and this might be where we assess the achievement of participation.
From the first week that I had done a simple prototype of a collaborative cocktails machine which aims to see how it can encourage collaboration and social connections between participants. However, from the first experiment, I do feel like there are a lot of things missing and there are a lot of issues that need to be figured out. so I stepped back and gives myself a bit more clear picture what collaboration is in this context and in what ways that we can encourage human connections. To do so, I looked into Werksatz by Franz Erhard Walther, It is a set of incomplete installations that never truly complete until participants interact with it. Werksatz consists of fabric objects with openings, fastenings or straps that participants could wear and use it together to active incomplete works to be complete. In this work, Walther was interested in exploring the relationships between objects and multi-users or the interrelation of bodies, materials and shared space between bodies.
(Fig.4 Werksatz by Franz Erhard Walther)
I also looked into activities or something that require two people or more to complete the task together, for example, three-legged race, Loren Carpenter's Pong experiment which a group-controlled game which a group of people has to work together to control a game.
(Fig.5 Loren Carpenter's Pong experiment)
In fig 6, It is the friendship machine by CocaCola. They designed 3.5-metre tall structure that requires two people to help each other to get two coke bottles for the price of one promo. These projects make me think about the interface that requires two or more people interact with it together. Let's call it ‚Äòco-operative interface'. To elaborate, two buttons need to be triggered by two people at the same time in order to control something. If just one button is triggered, the system will not work.
(Fig 6. The Friendship Machine by CocaCola)
Cocktail machine
I see possibilities to integrate the idea of having participants to be a part of the system to complete the installation, together with providing them with a co-operative interface where the discussion between participants arises to make a decision collaboratively.
For the next step, I have the following questions that will be a starting point and guideline for me to go for a further design.
// How can co-operative mixology experiences encourage human connections and group immersive experiences?
// How do people get involved in the cocktails machine?
// How do people collaborate or work together?
// How do we assess human connections?
// How do they know that they have control or be a part of the system?
Several people who hung a banner calling for abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement from the Statue of Liberty's pedestal on the Fourth of July have been arrested, and authorities say a person is scaling the statue's base.
National Park Service spokesman Jerry Willis says the climber was at the base beneath the statue's foot Wednesday afternoon. Willis says police are atop the base, advising the climber to go down.

It's unclear whether the climb is related to the earlier banner demonstration.
Willis says at least six people were taken into custody then. He says federal regulations prohibit hanging banners from the monument.
The banner said "Abolish I.C.E.," referring to part of the Department of Homeland Security. ICE officers arrest and deport immigrants who are in the United States illegally, among other duties.

For many companies in China it became more difficult to get funding on the bond market. The risk premium for corporate bonds with lower ratings is on the highest level in the last two years. More credit defaults mean that investor demand shifts to debt issued by state-owned enterprises. Christopher K. Lee, China Country Specialist with rating agency Standard & Poor's, sees liquidity tightening which affects in particular weak borrowers.
Mr Lee, defaults in the Chinese bond market are on the rise. Is this a surprise for you?
We have expected in our outlook for 2018 that defaults in China will rise this year from a very low base. Also we expect that Local Government Financing Vehicles, LGFVs, will likely default because of the tightening of liquidity in the market and toughening policy to control the debt of local government.
Did market participants share these expectations?
I don't think that at the end of last year there was a common expectation in the market that defaults will rise as investors expected good liquidity conditions to continue and a benign operating environment with strong company profits. The rise in defaults over the last few weeks was surprising for the market, especially the default of listed companies. Listed companies tend to have stronger balance sheets and better access to funding than privately held companies.
Christopher Lee: ¬´Investors had expected the government to intervene to support companies when the going gets tough.¬ª
What would the default of a local government bond mean?
A default of a bond of a local government funding vehicle would be a major event. It would reprice a lot of local government funding vehicle bonds more significantly even though spreads for weaker borrowers have widened in recent months. This would mean that the funding costs for such issuers would increase significantly. Until now we heard of defaults of trust products which are bilateral agreements between a LGFV as the borrower and a trust company as the lender. But we have not seen yet a default of a public bond.
What kind of issuers have defaulted already?
So far we have seen private companies defaulting. These are the group of companies most vulnerable to the tightening of liquidity. The big banks which are state-owned have a preference to allocate capital to SOEs, state-owned enterprises. In the early stage of the liquidity tightening due to the deleveraging campaign we expect that private companies are in the first wave of defaults. Now, the liquidity tightening will also affect weak borrowers across the board. The weak borrowers are those that have excess capacity and are highly leveraged.
Why did the market not expect a rise in defaults?
The market has underestimated the effect of the deleveraging campaign. Investors had expected the government to intervene to support companies when the going gets tough. Certainly the government has provided liquidity to ensure that enough companies can get financing, but as state-owned borrowers have been preferred private companies were starved in terms of credit. The funding channels for quasi-sovereign borrowers are still wide open.
But was not one goal of economic reforms to stop the preferential treatment of state-owned enterprises?
The long-term goal is still to reform the financial system, to open up and improve the depth of the capital market as well as to internationalize the Renminbi. But the immediate concern for the authorities is the high leverage in the system which means that a lot of companies depend on cheap credit to survive. The priority for the government now is to control the debt growth and reduce financial risks. This was announced already in July last year in the National Finance Work Conference. There is still a high degree of excess capacity in the economy that the government needs to remove.
What is the current policy towards local government funding?
Local government debt is a concern as it is growing at a very rapid rate. The central government is concerned about debt which is hidden in funding vehicles and companies owned by the local governments. These entities rely on back channels using shadow banking instruments like trust products, and entrusted loans. These back channels are not transparent to the central government, investors and the public. At the same time, the central government opens up the front channels to allow local governments to borrow in a transparent manner by issuing bonds and taking up regular bank loans. It also increases for local governments the bond issuance quota and also allocates more of the quota to special purpose bonds, for example bonds for land development and toll road building.
What is the outlook for property developers as the housing market cools down and many have debt denominated in foreign exchange?
One issue with property developers in China is that they do very little hedge as it is too costly. Until now that was not a big problem as the Renminbi is strong despite the weakening of many Emerging Market currencies. My expectation is that the currency will remain stable and the foreign-currency debt will remain manageable. But the financing conditions for property developers like for other private companies is quite difficult.
Could there be an increase in defaults of property developers then?
There a lot of small and medium sized property developers which are highly leveraged and could come under stress. They expanded aggressively over the last few years as the times were good by buying land and taking on debt. We are back in the cycle where some small and medium size developers could default. But this is not a systemic problem as they have only regional exposure and rely more on the local banks for funding.
But then local banks could find themselves under pressure?
The local banks are the ones who are most heavily squeezed by the deleveraging campaign. They depend on the wholesale funding market where costs became much higher. At the same time these banks need to unwind the shadow banking and wealth management trust products. There are squeezed on both sides: their funding position and their ability to extend credit has weakened.
Could an influx of foreign investors to the Chinese bond market provide more liquidity and funding?
My personal view is that foreign investors will play a more important role in the Chinese bond market. But in the beginning, foreign market participants are more comfortable buying quality government and bank bonds, not corporate bonds. They will buy rather the interest rate than credit products. Foreign investors are not sure about the credit quality and corporate governance of many companies. They will likely build up resources in China to assess the credit quality in order to become more comfortable with corporate bonds. Currently we are in early days, the share of foreign investor is still very small ‚Äì less than 3 per cent.

'D√©paysement' is the sound of being somewhere far, far away from home. It hums with the shock of being suddenly alone - in a place where no one cares who you are or what you're doing.
SUZUKA, Japan -- Lewis Hamilton smashed the track record at Suzuka to claim a comfortable pole position for the Japanese Grand Prix, where he will start ahead of title rival Sebastian Vettel on the front row.
After struggling for pace at the last two races in Singapore and Malaysia , Mercedes returned to form in Japan with Hamilton looking untouchable in all three qualifying sessions. His final benchmark was 0.332s quicker than the nearest man, teammate Valtteri Bottas, but the Finn will drop five places down the order once his grid penalty for a gearbox change is applied. That penalty will elevate Ferrari's Vettel one place after he set the third fastest time -- 0.140s off Bottas' time and 0.472s off Hamilton's benchmark.
Hamilton's advantage over Vettel was mainly found in the opening sector of the lap, which consists of the pit straight and a series of sweeping esses back up the hill. The combination of all three sectors saw him set a lap time 1.7s faster than Michael Schumacher's 2006 Q2 lap time at Suzuka, which had stood as the track record for over a decade. It was also Hamilton's first pole position at Suzuka -- the only track on the current calendar where he has not started from pole position during his career.
Red Bull drivers Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen took fourth and fifth ahead of the second Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen, which was repaired between sessions after he crashed at Degner 2 in final practice. Ricciardo was just 0.026s faster than his teammate Verstappen, and 0.192s faster than Raikkonen, who also faces a five-place grid penalty due to a gearbox change ahead of qualifying.
Force India locked out the fourth row of the grid, with Esteban Ocon 0.149s ahead of teammate Sergio Perez, who will be investigated after the session for impeding Lance Stroll's Williams during Q1. Felipe Massa took ninth on the grid in the other Williams ahead of Fernando Alonso, who looks set to start from the back of the grid due to a 35-place grid penalty for a power unit change.
Stoffel Vandoorne was knocked out of qualifying ahead of Q3 after setting a time 0.029s off Alonso's Q2 time. He will start ahead his teammate once Alonso's grid penalty is factored in and will have a free choice of tyre compounds to start the race. Nico Hulkenberg qualified 12th in the highest-placed Renault ahead of Kevin Magnussen in the Haas and teammate Jolyon Palmer, who faces a 20-place penalty for an engine change. Carlos Sainz will also drop 20 places after he set the 15th fastest time of the session for Toro Rosso.
Romain Grosjean crashed out of the first part of qualifying after losing control of his Haas between Turns 4 and 5. He complained of a handling problem on the car, but the accident itself was caused by him running wide on the exit of Turn 4 and losing the rear on the grass. The impact destroyed the front of the car and appeared to damage every corner, leaving the team with a big repair job ahead of Sunday's race.
Pierre Gasly qualified 17th behind Grosjean but ahead of Stroll, who will point to Perez as an explanation for his lowly starting position. The two Saubers will start on the back row of the grid, with Marcus Ericsson outqualifying teammate Pascal Wehrlein.

When Marvel TV first announced its intention to create original TV series for Netflix, the lineup consisted of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist, all leading up to the miniseries The Defenders. But Daredevil Season 2 introduced the comics character The Punisher into the mix, played by Jon Bernthal, and fans reacted so strongly that Marvel and Netflix moved forward with their first spinoff series: The Punisher.
The series debuted in November 2017 and was quickly renewed for a second season, which is currently in production. Collider's own Steve Weintraub spoke with The Punisher showrunner Steve Lightfoot at the Saturn Awards recently and asked him about the crafting of Season 2, fan expectations, and more.
When asked if he took fan reaction to Season 1 into account when putting together The Punisher Season 2, Lightfoot had an encouraging response:
‚ÄúThat's always tricky because you get such a variation, some people love it, some people hate it, some people are in the middle. My personal opinion with that stuff is you just have to be true to the character and the story you choose to tell. You want them to love it obviously, but if you start worrying about the audience it can be a trap. I think we just have to keep trying to be true to Frank's character and make him someone peoples want to hang out with.‚Äù
When Lighfoot pitched his take on The Punisher, did he have a full series arc in mind?:
‚ÄúVery loosely. What happens when you then start writing a season is you find things and writers come up with things and things appear in episodes and it sort of takes on a life of itself, so you can't be too rigid with that stuff. I always knew what the journey of Season 1 was which meant I knew what Season 2 would be.‚Äù
As for whether he'd rather have 10 episodes per season as opposed to the Marvel Netflix tradition of 13, Lightfoot said he's a fan of the slow burn:
‚ÄúIt's an interesting thing, that. People have always said to me, ‚ÄòDo you wish you'd have had 10?' and then I say, ‚ÄòWell then you would've had less story.' I always wanted it to be a slow burn show. I always felt like we had the right amount for 13, and you've gotta have enough story for that but I like how slow burn and character-driven the shows are.‚Äù
See what all Lightfood had to say about The Punisher in the player above. A premiere date for Season 2 has not yet been announced.
This weekend, Nebraska will honor its 1997 team that won the national championship.
It was a great squad led by stalwarts like Grant Wistrom, Aaron Taylor, Jason Peter, Ahman Green, Scott Frost, Mike Brown and Ralph Brown, who all still cast a big shadow in Lincoln. Even cooler: The crew punctuated the season with a win over Tennessee in the Orange Bowl in what was Peyton Manning's final game. It also was the final game for legendary Tom Osborne, as the triumph allowed Nebraska to claim the coaches' poll national title; Michigan won the AP championship.
The title was Nebraska's third in a four-year period. Heck, with a few breaks, the Cornhuskers may also have won it all in 1993 and 1996, too. But Nebraska missed a potential game-winning field goal vs. Florida State in the Orange Bowl that cost it the 1993 crown. And a 10-1 NU squad got stunned by 7-4 Texas in the inaugural Big 12 title game in 1996.
That's how close Nebraska came to winning five national championships in a row. Think about that.
It was a dominating run that few have been able to match in the last 20 years. But two schools have come close: USC and Alabama. And, it can be argued, Alabama's current run of excellence is on par or perhaps even more impressive than what Nebraska did in the mid-1990s.
‚Äì USC: The Trojans under Peter Carroll were an NFL team masquerading as a college unit in the early-2000s. USC won titles in 2003 and 2004. And it could have made it three in a row but the Trojans got stunned by Texas in the epic 2005 BCS title game.
‚Äì Alabama: The Crimson Tide machine is still smoking. Bama won four titles in seven years, taking home the hardware in 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2015. Alabama could have made it five championships in eight years but it lost to Clemson in the title game last season. Don't look now, but the Tide may win it all this season.
College football has changed a lot since that 1997 season. Scholarship limits have played a big role in leveling the playing field. And for the Huskers, the formation of the Big 12 in 1996 gave it increased competition with the likes of Texas and Texas A&M.
Nebraska got close to winning it all in 2001, when a Frank Solich-led team lost the BCS title game to a monster Miami (Fla.) squad. Since then, the Huskers have done a slow slide from the elite level. That makes clinging to memories of 1997 that much more special for Husker fans.
The end of the 1997 season was unique. Michigan entered the bowl season No. 1 in both the AP and coaches polls. Nebraska was No. 2. So, it stood to reason that if the Wolverines beat Ryan Leaf's No. 7 Washington State team in the Rose Bowl, they would be the national champ. And, Michigan prevailed, 21-16, behind Brian Griese.
But after the Huskers dispatched No. 3 Tennessee, 42-17, in the Orange Bowl, Nebraska lobbied and argued that it deserved to be national champs. There also was a sentimental aspect around the Cornhuskers, as prior to the bowl, Osborne announced he was retiring.
That confluence of events led Nebraska to being vaulted to No. 1 in the coaches poll and getting a share of the national title. The 13-0 Cornhuskers received 32 first-place votes in the coaches poll to 30 for the 12-0 Wolverines. Entering the bowls, Michigan had 53.5 first-place votes to Nebraska's 8.5 in the coaches poll.
Was it right for Nebraska to leap Michigan? Wrong? Doesn't matter. The Huskers were a champ ‚Ä¶ again. And it was a fitting way for Osborne and the program to end one of the most dominating runs in college football history.
Attorney General Bob Ferguson filed a consumer protection lawsuit today against a Massachusetts-based company, alleging it deceptively advertises and sells training packages to potentially thousands of Washingtonians for as much as $35,000 with promises of inside information on how to make money selling on Amazon.
Instead, the company, FBA Stores LLC, peddled bad advice and in some cases bad products likely to cause Amazon to shut down consumers' accounts, leaving them without the promised income and sometimes in debt.
‚ÄúThe defendants promise easy money, but deliver a scam,‚Äù Ferguson said. ‚ÄúI will not tolerate scammers preying on Washingtonians.‚Äù
The lawsuit, filed in King County Superior Court, accuses brothers Adam Bowser and Chris Bowser and their companies, including FBA Stores, of numerous violations of Washington's Consumer Protection Act (CPA) and Business Opportunity Fraud Act.
Separately, Amazon has filed its own lawsuit against the Bowsers.
The company has offered trainings in at least eight cities in Washington this year, with potentially thousands of Washingtonians receiving deceptive advertising and hundreds purchasing training.
Amazon Affiliation
The Bowsers deceive consumers by using multiple Amazon trademarks in their presentations and promotional materials, including the Amazon logo, creating the impression that they and their company are affiliated with or endorsed by Amazon. There is no such connection.
Some consumers told the Attorney General's Office that a presenter at a seminar talked about a recent meeting between the defendants and upper-level executives of Amazon. The presenter also told consumers that the defendants had agreements directly with Amazon, that Amazon was pleased with the defendants' operation, and that Amazon was considering contracting with the defendants to sell Amazon-branded merchandise.
The lawsuit alleges that the Bowsers' representatives have also intimated to consumers that complaints against them and their company might result in retaliation from Amazon (such as the suspension of the consumer's Amazon store) because Amazon did not want the defendants' operation disrupted.
Misleading advertising: ‚ÄúSecrets to making a stinking fortune on Amazon‚Äù
FBA Stores sends direct mailers promising a free ‚ÄúAmazon Workshop‚Äù in-person or online.
The brochures advertise a ‚Äúspecial invitation private event,‚Äù use various Amazon logos and promise to teach consumers to ‚Äú[m]ake $5,000-$10,000 in the next 30 days. ‚Ä¶ Even if you have never sold anything online before‚Äù or ‚Äújust make some extra $$ [sic] to Pay Your Basic Bills.‚Äù
Most mailers include ‚Äúcomplimentary VIP tickets‚Äù with a listed value of $147. In fact, these events are offered for free.
The defendants also send consumers email solicitations, signed by Chris or Adam Bowser, to encourage them to attend a free training or ‚Äúprofits workshop.‚Äù
The emails promise consumers that they will ‚Äúdiscover the secrets to making a stinking fortune on Amazon.‚Äù
The emails represent these as exclusive events: ‚ÄúIs this Fate? I don't know, but I believe it wasn't an accident that you were able to get tickets when other [sic] are going to be left out.‚Äù
High-pressure trainings
During a webinar, Chris Bowser claims he and Adam Bowser have made more than $75 million in online sales in 18 years of business, $12 million of which was through Amazon in only one year, and that they both have done more than $1 million in sales on Amazon in the last 30 days. He also claims that by using the system for sale to consumers, he made over $200,000 in a single year while in his twenties.
At the trainings, FBA Stores promises their ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù will allow clients to earn $5,000 to $10,000 per month by working less than an hour a day. Then, FBA Stores engages in aggressive sales tactics to get consumers to register for additional training ranging from $1,000 to $35,000, the lawsuit alleges.
FBA Stores then pressures consumers to apply for financing for starter capital, often pressuring consumers to apply for multiple credit cards or to take out mortgages on their property to cover the cost. Third-party credit vendors are on-site during these events, and may have an affiliation with FBA Stores, according to the lawsuit.
Consumers are required to pay at least $995 before they are allowed to read the contract.
The ‚Äútechniques‚Äù taught at the seminars, such as buying fake reviews or opening second accounts, violate Amazon's terms of use. As a result, Amazon may shut down the accounts of FBA Stores' clients. The defendants do not disclose this risk. Separately, the Bowsers operate a service where consumers pay for help in getting their account suspension lifted.
Products not as advertised
According to the lawsuit, FBA Stores encourages clients to use the company as a product supplier or an intermediary with other manufacturers and distributors.
In many cases, the lawsuit alleges, items advertised by FBA Stores as ‚Äúnew‚Äù are in fact used or refurbished, and items that are advertised as being in original packaging have been perceptibly repackaged. Often, items are of a lesser quality than advertised.
When FBA Stores' customers do not detect these problems themselves ‚Äî or use another service called ‚ÄúFulfillment by Adam‚Äù where products process and ship without ever reaching the client ‚Äî they may be confronted by their own customers or Amazon itself for selling mislabeled items or providing a misleading listing. This can lead to Amazon suspending their account.
Ultimately, clients may be unable to sell items purchased from FBA Stores at the profit promised in the trainings and advertising, and if Amazon shuts down their seller accounts, clients may be unable to sell the items at all.
The complaint asks the court to order the Bowsers and FBA Stores to stop their deceptive practices, provide restitution to affected consumers and impose civil penalties of up to $2,000 per violation.
Victims of FBA are encouraged to file a complaint with the Attorney General's Office.
Assistant Attorney General Andrea Alegrett and Special Assistant to the Attorney General M. Elizabeth Howe are handling the case.

Washington: Once an absentee first lady, Melania Trump embraced her moment in the spotlight Tuesday for the French president's state visit, ditching her trademark dark sunglasses and shining in a look-at-me white skirt suit and matching hat.
All eyes will again be on the former model Tuesday evening when she steps out in a designer gown to greet Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, as they arrive for the first state dinner of Trump's administration. The gown reveal is typically a highlight of any White House state dinner.
But for once, the gown may end up in a supporting role. To that hat.
Mrs. Trump wore the stylish belted suit with her broad-brimmed chapeau for her public appearances throughout the day, including on a brief outing to the National Gallery of Art with Mrs. Macron to view an exhibit of works by French painter Paul Cezanne.
The hat stayed atop her head as she returned to the White House and took her front-row seat in the East Room for the president's joint news conference with Macron. It bobbed up and down across the bottom of television screens as she entered the room and again as she rose to leave, spawning many a Twitter meme.
The hat was designed by Herve Pierre, the first lady's French-born stylist, according to Mrs. Trump's office.
"Designing is too big a word for a hat that classical," Pierre texted The Associated Press.
The skirt suit was a creation of Michael Kors, a designer the first lady has worn in the past.
Mrs. Trump was largely absent from Washington during the first six months of the administration, opting to continue living full time at the family's Trump Tower penthouse in New York City so their now-12-year-old son, Barron, wouldn't have to change schools in the middle of the year.
She was rarely seen ‚Äî and even more rarely heard ‚Äî during those months, even after she finally moved to Washington last June.
But she seems to be trying to change that, even pushing back publicly against her critics. She recently convened a White House discussion on cyberbullying, an issue she identified as her platform despite her husband's penchant for belittling and berating his foes on Twitter.
She acknowledged that people were skeptical of her commitment to curb cyberbullying but said it would not stop her from doing what she believes is right: helping children and the next generation.
Mrs. Trump's white outfit Tuesday recalled another high-profile occasion, the president's first State of the Union address, when the first lady wore a white pantsuit.
Trump gave the speech shortly after news broke earlier this year that his personal attorney had paid adult-film star Stormy Daniels $130,000 just before the 2016 presidential election to keep quiet about a sexual encounter Trump says didn't happen.
Inquiring minds wondered what kind of statement the first lady sought to make with her attire.
Her first state dinner seems to be another area where she is aiming to make a statement. The White House stressed that Mrs. Trump, who planned her 2005 wedding, had a hand in every detail of what is the social denouement of Macron's visit.
She released a brief video showing her working on the details with her staff, including the menu and the cream-and-gold table settings.
Clearly in her comfort zone, Mrs. Trump was seen exchanging pleasantries in French with members of Macron's delegation during the outdoor arrival ceremony. Her Louboutin stilettos also paid homage to the colors of the French flag with their trademark red sole, towering white heel and blue body.
About 130 guests, seated at round candle-lit tables decorated with bouquets of white flowers, will dine on rack of lamb and nectarine tart served on a mix of china settings from the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. After-dinner entertainment will be courtesy of the Washington National Opera.
State dinner tickets are highly sought after by Washington's political and business elite and the rather small guest list, compared to the hundreds of guests who came to some of President Barack Obama's dinners, gives Tuesday night's soiree a more exclusive feel.
Among those in attendance are Vice President Mike Pence, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Apple CEO Tim Cook and two Winter Olympians, who flashed medals on their way into the pre-dinner reception.
In a break with tradition, Trump excluded congressional Democrats and journalists, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the arrangements publicly. But some Democrats did make the cut, including Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards.

The AIADMK MPs have continued protests in the Parliament premises over the Cauvery issue.
The Opposition MPs held a meeting and will meet the Rajya Sabha chairperson to state that they want the House to function.
The Telugu Desam Party and the YSR Congress have asked all their MPs to be present in Parliament for a vote on a motion of no-confidence against Narendra Modi's NDA government.
The Parliament on Monday could not transact any business as the Opposition parties continued to stall proceedings over their demands, resulting a wash out of the second part of the budget session for eleven consecutive days.
In Lok Sabha, no-confidence motions tabled by arch rivals Telugu Desam Party and YSR Congress against the Modi government were not taken up in the Lok Sabha as the logjam continued amid no signs of thaw between the opposition and the government.
No substantive business could be transacted in last 11 days except for the passage of the Finance Bill, 2018 and relevant appropriation bills in the Lok Sabha.
After the House was adjourned for an hour and when it met again at 12 noon, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan sought to put the notices of the motion for leave of the House so that a discussion could be initiated. At least 50 members should back the motion for it to be admitted. But as has been happening for the last two weeks, AIADMK and the Telangana Rashtriya Samithi members raised slogans and walked to her podium, shouting slogans in support of their demands, creating a din.
The TRS members were demanding the increase in the reservation quota for jobs in Telangana while AIADMK members wanted the setting up of a Cauvery Management Board.
Several opposition parties including the Congress, Trinamool Congress, Nationalist Congress Party, Samajwadi Party, the AIMIM and Rashtriya Janata Dal have expressed their support for the notices.
The Speaker called the members to stand up so that the numbers could be counted to see how many supported it. But with members from the TRS and AIADMK holding placards and surrounding the Speaker's dais, Mahajan said she could not count the members who were standing. "Please go back to your seats. If the House is not in order, I will not bring the notices," she said, before adjourning the House for the day.
Minutes before Mahajan made her comments, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said the government was ready to face the motion. "We are ready for any discussion... We are also ready for a discussion on the no-confidence motion. I appeal to all political parties to cooperate," he pleaded.
Earlier, the Lower House started with disruptions and was adjourned till noon within a couple of minutes amid noisy protests by AIADMK and TRS members.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar told reporters before the House met that the government had the numbers to defeat the motion. "We are ready to face the no-confidence motion as we have support in the House. We are confident."
Telugu Desam Party MP RM Naidu said they were trying to gather as much support as possible from all the opposition parties in Parliament knowing fully that the motion would fall because the government has enough numbers.
At present, the Lok Sabha has 539 members. The BJP has 273 ‚Äî more than the half-way mark of 270. It also has the support of several allies like the Shiv Sena and the Akali Dal. But the Shiv Sena has said it would abstain. "We will support neither the government nor the Opposition," said party MP Arvind Sawant.
Meanwhile, TDP MPs protested in front of Mahatma Gandhi's statue in Parliament, demanding special category status for Andhra Pradesh. They were joined by Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury.
Scenes were no different in Rajya Sabha and amid the din the House was adjourned for the day within minutes after protests by TDP members. Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu adjourned the House as opposition members trooped near his podium immediately after tabling of papers.
Objected to the display of placards in the House he said the chair was willing to allow the discussion but members are not allowing the House to run. "How long the disruptions will continue," he said before adjourning the House.
The first two weeks of the last phase of the Budget session have been virtually washed out due to protests by several parties on different issues. The government has, however, managed to get some key bills and the budget passed amid the din through a voice vote without a debate.
The protests have been over wide ranging issues, including the Punjab National Bank fraud, special category status for Andhra Pradesh and constitution of Cauvery management board to solve water sharing dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.
It's no secret that British Columbia is facing a housing crunch and affordable rentals are hard to find in the Okanagan.
Coldstream resident Alexah Zarr is feeling the impacts first-hand.
She is looking for a new place for her family of five, including three kids, to call home.
‚ÄúWe are super stressed out,‚Äù she admits.
The family was given four months' notice they'd have to move out of their current rental home.
However, with less than two months to go, the family is struggling to find a new rental even with a budget of $1,500 to $1,800 per month.
‚ÄúWe are super worried. If we could buy a house we would, but unfortunately even the housing prices are insane,‚Äù said Zarr.
Zarr just one of those feeling the squeeze.
‚ÄúWe know the Okanagan is really struggling around affordable rental,‚Äù said provincial Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Selina Robinson.
Robinson said making sure British Columbians have affordable homes is her government's primary focus.
‚ÄúWe announced 1,700 units of affordable rentals that we are investing in around the province and there is certainly more in the upcoming budget,‚Äù said Robinson.
This week the Union of B.C. Municipalities came out with 32 recommendation aimed at tackling B.C.'s housing challenges: they included allowing zoning for affordable rental housing and looking at a sellers' tax to discourage quick, speculative resales.
‚ÄúHaving local governments willing to partner with the province and with the federal government really means that together we are going to be able to deliver on housing for people who need it most,‚Äù said Robinson.
However, for now the minister is staying tight-lipped about what recommendations Victoria might implement.
‚ÄúThere are lots of things that we've been considering and when we move forward on the throne speech and the budget, people will see exactly how we are moving forward on this housing agenda,‚Äù she said.
Those longer-term fixes likely won't come soon enough to help Zarr's family find a new home by April 1.
‚ÄúWe are super scared for our future and I'm scared for my kids' futures. If it this bad now, what is it going to be like in 20 years?‚Äù said Zarr.
That will likely depend on how politicians choose to tackle the current housing challenges.
Becky McCabe had the perfect proposal in mind: get down on one knee during a trip to the Memphis Zoo.
But it turns out her girlfriend, Jessa Gillaspie, had the exact same idea.
Over the weekend, Gillaspie posted a video of the couple's proposal on Facebook, one that has social media users in awe.
I had no idea she planned to propose, and she had no idea I planned to propose to her! We were both so surprised! We were surrounded by our friends and had the most amazing night. I am the luckiest girl in the world to be able to call her my fianc√©,‚Äù she wrote on the social media site.

In the video, both are seen posing for a photo with matching pretzel necklaces, while the videographer, a friend, asks the couple to look at each other for Instagram.
In that moment, with McCabe clearly holding a ring box behind her back, she asks Gillaspie to marry her, by going down on one knee. Gillaspie, shocked and excited, runs to her bag and brings out the ring she planned to propose with.
‚ÄúI guess that's a yes,‚Äù the unnamed videographer said.

According to NBC affiliate WTHR, the two planned on proposing at the zoo because it was the location of their first date. They also plan on getting married next summer.
‚ÄúWe had no idea this would blow up so quickly! But I can't say I'm not thrilled, because all I've ever wanted was for Beck and the world to know how much l love her. We are overwhelmed with all of the positive responses. Really, you guys have no idea how much that means to us,‚Äù Gillaspie wrote after the video went viral.
Social media users in love
On Facebook, hundreds of strangers and close friends wished the couple well, as well as acknowledging how hilariously timed their proposal was. Countless vendors have also offered to shoot the couple's engagement pictures and take part in their wedding.
‚ÄúI can't stop watching this ‚Ä¶ My wife and I are at a year and a half of marriage and there's nothing like it,‚Äù user Jackie McGinnis wrote.
‚ÄúI've been secretly stalking this beautiful relationship for a while. It's about time,‚Äù user Carolyn Durant wrote.
‚Äúdon't know you two, we have a mutual friend‚Ä¶ But THAT was the best proposal ever. Just absolutely PERFECT! So much love shared,‚Äù user Terry Hogan Coulston wrote.
Earlier this year, Tori Monaco and Berkley Cade of Texas also both planned proposals on the same day.
‚ÄúWhen in the universe will there ever be two lesbians that want to propose at the same time, the same day, the same place, and the same way? I have to get it right,‚Äù Kristy told BuzzFeed News in February.

Jason Day is getting better at forgetting. He's letting go of things that bother him, trying to keep distractions from infecting his golf swing. Most of the time, it works for the 29-year-old Australian who has been the No. 1 golfer in the world since last March.
Sometimes it doesn't.
For a stretch last weekend at Pebble Beach, he looked more like a guy who'd rather go look for seals in Carmel Bay than swing a club on one of the world's most famous golf courses.
Day had completed the suspended second round very early Saturday, and his 64 gave him a share of the lead. That disappeared quickly.
He shot a 41 for his first nine holes of Round 3 to basically fall out of contention.
But what happened next illustrated how Day, already a force in professional golf, is still evolving. On his second nine, he shot 34 and the next day bounced back to shoot a five-under-par 67 to finish in a tie for fifth.
‚ÄúI felt like a 75 was the best score I could have shot, which sounds terrible, doesn't it?‚Äù he said Tuesday as he prepared to play in the Genesis Open at Riviera Country Club.
‚ÄúBut I actually came on strong and had four birdies in the last six holes.‚Äù
With the effect of three back surgeries on Tiger Woods' game not far from Day's mind, he has tried to shorten his swing to lessen the strain on his lower back. He's still adjusting to it, and occasionally gets stuck thinking too much rather than letting the swing flow. Day's back issues forced him to withdraw from the Tour Championship last September.
‚ÄúI got a little bit too technical with my swing,‚Äù he said of the 41. ‚ÄúWhen you're free flowing and in the zone, you don't think of anything other than trying to get the ball from point A to point B.‚Äù
Either Dustin Johnson or Hideki Matsuyama could overtake Day as No. 1 with a victory this weekend, depending on Day's performance. He wants to hold the spot for a full calendar year, but he'll recover if he doesn't.
‚ÄúWinning takes care of everything,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf someone takes if off me, I'm OK with it. I'm not going to be angry or sad about it‚Ä¶.
‚ÄúI feel like I've really learned a lot about myself over the past year, being able to let things go. ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI've got to point where things are different for me. When I used to play bad golf, I'd lock myself in the back of the bus and want to go mad. It's not like that anymore; I feel really good about how things are in my life right now.‚Äù
Day has always been known as a deliberate player, slow by some standards. But he insists his pace when he gets to his ball is predicated on how to execute the shot.
‚ÄúYou know, I would think that everyone in this room would take just a little bit longer if they had a million dollars on their mind,‚Äù he said.
Any reaction from other players on his pace of play?
‚ÄúI think Bubba [Watson] got me in the restroom one time. He said he was going to report me. ‚Ä¶ I said OK, it's fine, you can fine me as long as I keep beating you."
Riviera hasn't been kind to Day. He's played three times, missed the cut twice and finished tied for 62nd in his most recent effort, 2012.
‚ÄúLooking at that, I probably shouldn't tee it up,‚Äù he said jokingly. ‚ÄúWith that said, I feel like I'm a better player now than I was. ‚Ä¶ I've just got to keep my head down and keep playing and keep fighting on forward.‚Äù
Coming home ‚Ä¶ sort of
Thomas Pieters, the animated Belgian who won four points for the Europeans in the 2016 Ryder Cup at Hazeltine, is playing at Riviera on a sponsor's exemption. Pieters, who mockingly raised an index finger to his mouth to quiet fans during the Americans' lopsided victory, won the 2012 NCAA individual championship at Riviera while playing for Illinois.
What's his fondest memory of that week?
‚ÄúJust staying in Santa Monica,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe used to play in the Midwest and it's not very pretty down there.‚Äù
Storms on the horizon
The weather forecast is foreboding for Friday and Saturday morning. Heavy rain, with 100% chance of precipitation according to the Weather Channel, could threaten play Friday. In 2006, Adam Scott was declared the winner after only two rounds had been played because of rain.
Matt Morton, Riviera superintendent, said the design for drainage of the course helps keeps water off the playing areas and he has doubled the normal grounds crew from 40 to 80 for the event. He expects the course to hold up well.
‚ÄúWe'll have quite a few people to help move water off the golf course, if need be,‚Äù he said.

Ontario Provincial Police say a post-mortem examination confirms the human remains found in the Grand River in Belwood on Saturday are that of three-year-old Kaden Young.
Kaden was swept away by the floodwaters on Feb. 21, after the van he and his mother were in, was pulled into the river just west of Orangeville.

Police were called to Belwood on Saturday afternoon after a local fisherman discovered the body of a child in the water underneath a bridge about 13 kilometres downstream from where Kaden went missing.
In a Facebook post on Sunday, Kaden's mother, Michelle Hanson said the search had come to an end and thanked everyone who ‚Äúhelped in the efforts‚Äù to bring Kaden home.

I was pretty excited when I learned that Natalie Portman was going to be hosting Saturday Night Live, but I was extremely jazzed when I saw that the inimitable Tina Fey and Rachel Dratch crashed the Super Bowl SNL sketch and Twitter was here for it. Sometimes, you just need to bring in a ringer. (Or two). And it was definitely one of my favorite sketches of the night, and I don't even watch football.
The sketch opened during the American Revolutionary War, in which the founding fathers are talking about how New England won another battle, which is technically a good thing, but they're just so obnoxious when they win. Enter a troupe of Bostoners (and one person from Connecticut), who come into the room celebrating with mugs of beer and loud catchphrases, led by none other than Rachel Dratch. I had hardly had time to register my excitement when the group from Philadelphia showed up, led by Tina Fey. Seriously, nobody does folksy impressions like Tina Fey. Can these two just come back to the show full time please? I would watch them argue over nothing for hours upon hours on end. Especially if they're doing specific regional accents.
The founding fathers are all standing around talking about how New England has just won a great battle and sighing heavily. "Is this not good news?" Pete Davidson asks Beck Bennett, who responds, "Now we have to hear the boasting from the New England Patriots." Wow those Colonial Patriots sure seem a lot like the fans of the New England Patriots football team. When congratulated on their many victories, Dratch responds in a perfect Boston drawl, "Try five, boss." That's how many times the Patriots have won the Super Bowl. Their braggadocio even included a shout out for "Thomas Brady."
Since the Patriots are facing off against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday, the next entry into the room makes perfect sense. Representing Philadelphia was the one, the only, Tina Fey, who was greeted with a huge round of applause as soon as she entered the room. "Yeah how yous doing? we crossed many waters up the Scoogle River to give all yous a message: Philly is mad strong. From the little babies to all our mommoms and poppops we's ready to fight!" It was at about that point that Pete Davidson had to hold his piece of prop paper over his face to keep from breaking character. "Call us the eagles cuz we's ready to fly!" said Fey, except she pronounced eagles like "iggles." I am in love with this.

Condo Cruising
MSC Seaside has the ultimate rooms with a view.
There are very few cruise-related things that I have no desire to experience and I always believed a shipyard visit was one of them. I mean, yeah, it might be fun for about 20 minutes seeing a ship in its early stages but then I'd be looking around for a waiter with a tray of Champagne flutes and realize I'd have to wait about a year for him to materialize.
In the meantime, I'd be surrounded by blow torches and jackhammers, cables and all those wires that I'd likely trip over. The cranes soaring above my head would scare the hell out of me and the hard hat I'd have to wear would mess up my hair something awful.
But recently, I saw photos of MSC Seaside under construction at Fincantieri shipyard in Monfalcone, Italy, and I suddenly understood the allure of a shipyard visit.
It probably has a lot to do with MSC Seaside herself. Now, I'm usually a purist when it comes to what I consider a beautiful ship. I expect a ship to look like ‚Ä¶ well ‚Ä¶ a ship, small to midsize. I don't want to sail something that looks like an office building riding the waves, and at 160,000 grt and a capacity of more than 4,000 guests, you'd think that MSC Seaside would fall into that category. And yet ‚Ä¶ I'm dazzled.
Okay, I'll admit it ‚Ä¶ it's those 14 aft corner ‚Äúbeach condo‚Äù accommodations ‚Äî they have me positively drooling. They look like those fabulous Miami luxury apartments advertised in the pages of Delta Sky magazine with ‚Äústarts at $1.8 million dollars‚Äù in small print underneath. And even in their current skeletal form I can see myself standing on the balcony under the Caribbean sun, glass of wine in hand, staring at the ship's hypnotic churning wake.
If I should ever decide to leave my beach condo, MSC Seaside has other stuff that grabs me ‚Ä¶ her sea-level wraparound open air promenade, 20 bars, a ton of restaurants, and an interactive waterpark that, judging from MSC's promotional video, looks like everything on deck has sprung a leak at the same time. Way cool.
I'm not sure that I'll be trying out the 425-foot zip line or strolling along the overwater glass catwalks, but, hey, with those 20 bars on board, anything's possible.
MSC Seaside is open for booking and will start sailing in December 2017 from Miami to the Caribbean ‚Ä¶ and for anyone who's looking to buy me a Christmas gift, one of those beach condos ‚Äî fully constructed ‚Äî would be absolutely perfect.

After 20 years, Intel is scrapping its marquee annual Intel Developer Forum event, where tech enthusiasts gathered to load up on the chipmaker's news and technologies.
IDF started off in 1997 as a small event in Palm Springs, California. The show was later moved to San Francisco and vastly expanded during a boom in the PC market.
But with the PC market slowing down, the attraction of IDF has also dwindled. Intel's future isn't tied to PCs but instead to areas like data centers, autonomous cars, modems, the internet of things, and manufacturing.
Last year, IDF events were held in San Francisco and Beijing, and neither will happen this year. An event was scheduled this year from Aug. 15 to 17 in San Francisco, according to a calendar for Moscone Convention Center, but it has been canceled.
In lieu of IDF, Intel will instead hold small events, workshops, and participate in trade shows to highlight its technologies and connect with customers. Intel has a big presence every year at shows like CES, Computex, and Mobile World Congress.
Apple iPhone launches in the past have upstaged IDF San Francisco. From 2012 to 2014, iPhone launches around the time of IDF became the main topic of conversation on the show floor.
In 2011, IDF clashed with Microsoft's Build Conference being held in Anaheim, California, and Windows 8, Windows RT, and ARM chips were part of the conversation at Intel's show.
To avoid a clash with Apple's iPhone launches and other shows like TechCrunch Disrupt, Intel eventually moved IDF to mid-August in 2015.
Major PC, chip, and data-center announcements were a staple of the show, but such announcements have dwindled in the last few years.
Over the final years, IDF started losing its technical edge and became more of a marketing vehicle for the company as it expanded into wearables, drones, cool gadgets, and other devices. The company used the show to send a message that it was more than a technology company.
Intel in 2013 scrapped a popular third-day opening keynote by former CTO Justin Rattner, who showed off future-looking technologies like a solar-powered PC. It was replaced by keynotes that didn't touch on deep technology.
Privately, attendees grumbled that Intel was losing its core audience of engineers and technology specialists with its grand show of cool devices.
Intel will be able to connect to developers via trade shows and workshops, which are more targeted, a company spokeswoman said.
EyeWire, neuroscience's most audacious experiment, just opened up a digital museum.
Constructed with the help of a quarter million gamers, EyeWire Museum is one-of-a-kind: the 3D interactive playground showcases neurons in a mouse's retina in exquisite detail, down to every bend and turn in a cell's sinuous branches.
Unlike previous ‚Äúbrain atlases,‚Äù EyeWire Museum doesn't just chart the physical structure of its neurons. Ripe for exploration are data about how individual neurons spring to action. Like humans, each neuron has its own character: in the light of stimuli, some may choose to respond quickly but soon shut off; others may activate in a slow burn. The new museum contains these functional data for exploration. Linking physical structure to functional data is extremely rare. Making it available at the level of single cells‚Äîroughly 400 in total‚Äîis even rarer.
The museum isn't just aesthetically pleasing. Releasing it open-source to the neuroscience community offers a detailed, expansive resource that could help collaborations in projects such as retinal prosthetics. As the light sensor and first stage of visual processing in the brain, the retina holds the key to how our brains process images with such ease. Unveiling their secrets could even help machine vision scientists construct AI systems that mimic nature's solution to vision.
‚ÄúThis interactive viewer is a huge asset for these larger collaborations, especially among people who are not physically in the same lab,‚Äù said Amy Robinson Sterling, the executive director of EyeWire.
It's a significant contribution, said Dr. Marla Feller at UC Berkeley's Department of Molecular and Cell Biology & Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, who was not involved in the research.
‚ÄúEstablishing a relationship between the structure and function of a neuron is a primary goal of neurobiologists,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúBy completely reconstructing neighboring neurons of the same type within one piece of the retina, we can now examine their spatial relationships.‚Äù
You can check the museum for yourself here. The results were published in the prestigious academic journal Cell, with‚Äîhooray!‚Äîcredit to the EyeWire players that made it happen.
Citizen Connectomics
When Sebastian Seung left a promising career in theoretical neuroscience in 2005 for brain mapping, his colleagues thought he was crazy.
Although projects that ‚Äúmap the brain‚Äù seem commonplace these days, the idea was inconceivable a mere decade ago. The scale alone is staggering: the human brain contains 80 billion neurons densely packed into a space smaller than a football. Untangling the trillions of connections that neurons make is like tracing a single string of spaghetti in a bowl the size of the Pacific Ocean.
Yet Seung saw the potential in charting the brain's unexplored connectivity.
The theoretical physicist-turned-neuroscientist is an early evangelist for connectomics, a wild plan to map the functional connections between neurons in an effort to figure out how the brain works. In a popular TED talk, Seung laid out his theory of ‚Äúyou are your connectome‚Äù: every memory, experience, and personality trait that makes you you are stored within the physical structure of the connections in your brain. Reconstruct the connectome and‚Äîin theory‚Äîscientists may be able to reconstruct you.
Imaging the brain is a crazy complicated engineering project. First, scientists treat the brain with chemicals so it doesn't melt into mush when it's extracted. The entire brain is then sliced into wafer-thin sections on a machine that looks somewhat like a deli meat slicer. Each section is then carefully imaged under powerful microscopes, a tiny snippet at a time, and the resulting images are pieced together in files on the scale of gigabytes per section.
That's the easy part.
Even harder work comes after the images are assembled. When Seung began his then-unorthodox pursuit of connectomics, he estimated that it would take a single human tracer roughly a million years to trace all the neurons and their branches in a cubic millimeter of human cortex. An entire human brain would require a trillion years.
Obviously he needed some help. His solution? Gamify brain mapping.
EyeWire, the Game
In 2012, when Angry Birds was in its prime, Seung had an inspiration.
‚ÄúWhat if,‚Äù he wondered, ‚Äúwe could capture even a small fraction of the mental effort that goes into Angry Birds (for brain mapping)? Think of what we could do.‚Äù
Although the initial idea was to use deep learning-based AI tools to reconstruct the neurons, humans were‚Äîand still are‚Äîbetter at spotting the patterns of neuronal branches and connectors than machines. Collaborating with Dr. Kevin Slavin, a fellow professor at MIT with a background in game design, Seung tried to make a game about brain tracing as enthralling as a first-person shooter. Spoiler: you can't.
Since its inception, the game has garnered some die-hard fans (and an anime-style intro on the website) with its numerous achievement badges, a scoreboard and swag for competitions. Nevertheless, EyeWire still resembles a game you would ‚Äúplay‚Äù in biology class, and the 265,000 plus gamers contributing do it ‚Äúfor science!‚Äù rather than as nighttime relaxation.
‚ÄúThe community has really been the driving force behind why Eyewire has been successful,‚Äù said director Sterling. ‚ÄúYou come in, and you're not alone.‚Äú
In the game, each player is given a tiny cube of the retinal tissue, about 4.5 microns wide‚Äîthat's about the width of a human hair for a 10-by-10 block of cubes. To ensure accuracy, each cell is reviewed by between 5 and 25 gamers‚Äîif the results match up, the trace is accepted by the game as being complete. These traces are then fed as ‚Äútraining data‚Äù to the deep learning algorithm, which learns to better recognize individual neuronal branches among a giant tangled mass.
Eventually the goal is to automate the entire process. While a pipe dream just five years ago, the power of deep learning in biology has been transformative. A recent study used a powerful algorithm to identify dead neurons in microscope-generated images, a task normally relegated to junior neuroscientist trainees. As more data pours in, EyeWire may eventually learn to self-map, and such a strategy could be adopted to explore other regions in the brain in other species.
A Whole New (Retinal) World
The biggest surprise in the latest EyeWire Museum release is the discovery of six new types of retinal cells. Just a few years ago, scientists estimated the number of ganglion cells‚Äîthe major cell type in the retina‚Äîto be around 15 to 20. The team found more than 35 types.
‚ÄúThere's a little sliver of a mouse retina, and almost 10 years later, we're still learning things from it,‚Äù said Seung.
Making sense of the roughly 400 densely packed retinal cells was a challenge. ‚ÄúThe prior studies were limited to tens of neurons sparsely sampled from a single individual,‚Äù explained Seung and his team.
Here, they found that different cells grow along different physical planes in the retina‚Äîin fact, a brief look in the museum shows how remarkably flat these cells are stretched in space, compared to a neuron in the cortex.
Unlike previous brain atlases, EyeWire lets its users browse multiple neurons at the same time‚Äîrather than a single reconstruction. This simultaneous display lets scientists visualize overlaps between the neuron's branches as potential points of connection, explained the authors.
These may just be among the first discoveries as scientists around the globe experiment with the dataset.
Neuroscientists are still in the early stages of assembling the brain's ‚Äúparts list,‚Äù explains study author Nicolas Turner, adding, ‚ÄúIf you know what parts make up the machine you're trying to break apart, you're set to figure out how it all works.‚Äù

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Bonds recovered all intraday losses following a report that the central bank might conduct open market purchases to support the government's borrowing programme.
The Reserve Bank of India might undertake open market operations to support the bond market and the budgeted bond buybacks are also likely to be completed by March, local newswire Newsrise said, citing an official.
The news pulled down the 10-year benchmark bond yield to 7.55 percent. The yield had risen to a high of 7.68 percent earlier in the day, the highest since February 2016 on worries that the RBI might come out with a hawkish policy next week.
The paper had ended at 7.6 percent on Thursday.
A 92-year-old woman in the US state of Arizona allegedly shot dead her son, 72, to scuttle his plans to send her into a care home, police said on Wednesday.Anna Mae Blessing, who is charged with murder, contemplated her son's intentions to put her into care for days, US media reported."You took my life, so I'm taking yours," she reportedly said as she was escorted out of the Arizona home she shared with her son and his girlfriend.She told police she had intended to kill herself, too."From my understanding, she had thought about it for a few days because there was a dispute regarding her son wanting to put her in an assisted living home," Maricopa County Sgt. Bryant Vanejas told CNN affiliate KPHO.The incident happened in the morning of July 2 in the town of Fountain Hills, Maricopa county, police said.Blessing's son, whose name has not been released, wanted her to leave for an assisted living facility because she "had become difficult to live with".The mother concealed two firearms in her robe pockets before confronting her son in his bedroom, police said in a statement. During the ensuing argument, she pulled out one revolver, purchased in the 1970s, and fired at her son.Police found the son dead, with two bullet wounds to his neck and jaw.Blessing then pointed the gun at her son's 57-year-old girlfriend, who managed to wrestle it away and throw it into a corner of the room.She then pulled out a second pistol, which she told police her late husband had given to her in the 1970s. The girlfriend managed to knock this one out of Blessing's hands, too, before escaping and calling the sheriff's office.Police found Blessing in a reclining chair in her bedroom. She later told them she deserved to be "put to sleep" for her actions.She is charged with first-degree murder, aggravated assault and kidnapping, and her bail was set at USD 500,000.Police said they had visited the residence before, following a verbal altercation between Blessing and her son.
West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday claimed that she won't give any credit to BJP for winning the Tripura elections as winning in Tripura is like ‚Äúwinning the municipal elections‚Äù.Discrediting the BJP's massive victory in Tripura, which had remained a Left bastion for 25 years, Banerjee told News18 Bangla in an exclusive interview that the recently concluded elections is not a cause of worry for her.The Tripura elections were being touted as the gateway for BJP to make inroads into Bengal.Speaking on Congress' refusal to go into an alliance with the Trinamool Congress in Bengal, she added, ‚ÄúWe wanted to give 30 seats to the Congress in Tripura, to which they did not agree. But now the time has come to think collectively.‚ÄùReflecting her opinion of the Left stalwarts of Bengal, Mamata said that except for a few Left leaders of the earlier generation, most don't have any ideology and in Bengal they have struck a secret deal with the BJP to take on the Trinamool Congress.She said, ‚ÄúFormer Chief Minister Jyoti Basu used to believe in an ideology. Even Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, also ex-CM, believes in an ideology. But most of the Left leaders in Bengal today do not believe in any such thing. They are opportunists.‚ÄùShe went on to elaborate on her claim saying, ‚ÄúI have all the information on who is having lunch and dinner together and who all are meeting with the BJP leaders. ‚ÄòRam' (BJP) and ‚ÄòBaam' (Left parties) are together in Bengal.‚ÄùSpeaking on the violence during panchayat poll nomination procedure, she said, ‚ÄúCertain media houses in Bengal have joined hands with the BJP and are spreading hatred. I would like to ask them if our workers were involved in violence then how come the Opposition parties managed to file nearly 96,000 nominations.‚ÄùShe added, ‚ÄúThere is one media house in Bengal which broadcasts fake news. They brought goons from neighbouring Jharkhand and created problem in Birbhum's Suri. One person was killed and it is a matter of investigation as to how did the particular media house manage to get footage of the dead body. The person who was killed was a TMC worker and if they think that they can get away with such crime, then we will not spare them.‚ÄùShe also said that it would be tough for the BJP to win the 2019 General Elections because of the blunder they had made with the twin decisions of demonetisation and GST.

Terrorism an enemy of basic human rights: Swaraj at SCO Foreign Ministers' meet in China | External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj today said that terrorism is an enemy of the basic human rights and the fight against it should also identify States that encourage, support and finance the menace and provide sanctuary to terror groups. Swaraj, during her address at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Foreign Ministers here, raised the issue of global terrorism and protectionism. There are a number of challenges that are being faced by the world today, foremost being the threat of global terrorism and the imminent need to build a strong security architecture to combat it, the minister said. "Terrorism is an enemy of the basic human rights: of life, peace, and prosperity," Swaraj said. "Protectionism in all its forms should be rejected and efforts should be made to discipline measures that constitute barriers to trade. "India is committed to working with the SCO to strengthen our economic and investment ties.We believe that economic globalization should be more open, inclusive, equitable and balanced for mutual benefits," Swaraj added.
Lawyers for the NFL urged a federal judge Wednesday to appoint a special investigator to look into what the league said is extensive fraud in claims on the $1 billion concussion settlement.
NFL attorneys said a study by the independent auditors in the claims process showed about 440 claims were flagged for denial based on evidence of fraud by attorneys, doctors or former players. Lawyers representing the former players and their estates said most of the opportunity for fraud has been resolved because anyone filing a claim after the settlement's effective date has to see a neuro-specialist from a list of approved certified physicians.
The settlement, which took effect January 2017, resolved thousands of lawsuits that accused the NFL of hiding what it knew about the risks of repeated concussions.
It covers retired players who develop Lou Gehrig's disease, dementia or other neurological problems believed to be caused by concussions suffered during their pro careers, with awards as high as $5 million for the most serious cases.
"We are talking about significant evidence of widespread fraud. We're not talking about a difference in medical opinion," said NFL attorney Richard Tarlowe.
Tarlowe showed evidence in fraud designations against eight doctors, two law firms and a former player. He focused on practices including doctors seeing players for evaluation not in clinical settings, but in hotel rooms, law offices or other places. He also cited a doctor who said she spent seven to 12 hours evaluating each patient, but approved sometimes as many as eight patients a day.
"That's physically impossible based on how long she said it takes," he said.
Three different attorneys who represent dozens of claimants spoke for the former players Wednesday. Two said they objected to the appointment of a special investigator with subpoena power and the ability to compel testimony.
They said the current structure is more than adequate for identifying fraud and not paying out claims. They also said the rules that became effective in January 2017 including the approved physicians list will greatly reduce the opportunity for fraudulent claims.
League lawyers said investigating the fraud claims has contributed to the slower determinations and awarding of money for legitimate claims. Plaintiffs' attorneys have said the settlement process is moving too slowly.
The claims administrators confirmed Wednesday that more than $300 million has been paid out from about $439 million that has been awarded through the claims process‚Äî nearly three times the expected amount for the first year of the settlement.
They also said they have the ability to determine if a claim is fraudulent and flag it for denial. The power of a special investigator would be to determine if there was purposeful intent behind the fraudulent claims.
Tarlowe said if intent is determined, cases could be referred to the Department of Justice, lawyers and doctors could be turned in to professional ethics panels and lose their ability to practice or other punitive measures might be taken.
Judge Anita Brody said she had only seen one case of fraud against a former player out of almost 20,000 possible claimants who registered.
"To be clear we are talking mostly about the doctors and lawyers in these cases," she said.
Fifteen rights groups have today written to 11 states and the European Union calling for action ahead of the conclusion of Bahraini human rights defender Nabeel Rajab's appeal against his two-year sentence for stating that Bahrain bars reporters and human rights workers from entry into the country.
In the letters, which are addressed to the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union, as well as Germany, Ireland, France, Sweden, Italy, Denmark, Switzerland, Norway and Canada, the rights groups ask the states ‚Äúto urgently raise, both publicly and privately, the case of Nabeel Rajab, one of the Gulf's most prominent human rights defenders.‚Äù The letter further urges governments to support Rajab ‚Äúby condemning his sentencing and calling for his immediate and unconditional release, and for all outstanding charges against him to be dropped.‚Äù
On 22 November 2017 Mr Rajab is expecting the conclusion of his appeal against a two-year prison sentence. Rajab was sentenced on 10 July 2017 on charges of ‚Äúpublishing and broadcasting fake news that undermines the prestige of the state‚Äù under article 134 of Bahrain's Penal Code, in relation to his statement to journalists that the Bahraini government bars reporters and human rights workers from entering the country. In a previous appeal court hearing earlier this month, the judge refused to allow the defence's evidence, including testimonies of journalists and researchers who had been banned from entering Bahrain.
The human rights defender, who is President of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR), has been detained since his arrest on 13 June 2016. He was held largely in solitary confinement in the first nine months of his detention, violating the UN Standard Minimum Rules for Non-Custodial Measures (Tokyo Rules).
Nabeel Rajab has been imprisoned for exposing injustice in Bahrain. Three of my own family members have been imprisoned and tortured for my human rights campaigning. The Bahraini government pursues a pattern of revenge tactics against human rights defenders, but we will not rest until they are freed. If the UK government cares for the rights of Bahraini people, then it must tell its repressive ally that this violent campaign to silence us is unacceptable.
Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, Director of Advocacy, Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy
Rajab faces up to a further 15 years in prison on a second set of charges related to comments he made on Twitter criticising the Saudi-led war in Yemen and exposing torture in Bahrain. His 18th court hearing will be held on 31 December 2017. In September, the Public Prosecution brought new charges against related to social media posts made while he was already in detention; he has also been charged with ‚Äúspreading false news‚Äù in relation to his letter from a Bahraini jail published in the New York Times.
Rajab was transferred to Jau Prison on 25 October 2017. He was subjected to humiliating treatment on arrival, when guards immediately searched him in a degrading manner and shaved his hair by force. Prison authorities have singled him out by confiscating his books, toiletries and clothes, and raiding his cell at night. Rajab is isolated from other prisoners convicted for speech-related crimes and is instead detained in a three-by-three metre cell with five inmates.
The ongoing judicial harassment of Nabeel Rajab is a gross injustice. Nabeel is a man of peace who seeks democratic reforms for his country. His persecution for expressing his opinions -- something taken for granted in many nations -- must not stand. We call on Bahrain to recognise international human rights norms by releasing Nabeel and ending its prosecution of him.
Jodie Ginsberg, CEO, Index on Censorship:
Campaigners today protested outside the Bahrain embassy in London to call on the Bahraini regime to release Nabeel Rajab and end reprisal attacks against the family of Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, a prominent UK-based human rights campaigner living in exile from Bahrain, who is Director of Advocacy at the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy.

By MSUE AZA, Kaduna
Hundreds of youths drawn from various states in the North, have staged a peaceful rally in Kaduna, urging President Muhammadu Buhari to ignore calls for his resignation.
Speaking on behalf of the group, Ibrahim Garkuwa,while declaring total support for the Buhari's administration,said they were happy with the manner in which he has governed the country in the last two years.
A member of the group, Mohammed Sani, also noted that in spite of repeated attempts to portray the present administration as not performing, the President has achieved far better than his predecessors.
The group insisted that President Buhari has fulfilled his campaign promises to Nigerians, especially in areas of anti-corruption fight and security despite the challenges he met on ground.
They described those calling for his resignation as enemies of the country who are not happy with the successes recorded by his administration in riding Nigeria of corruption.
The group maintained that the President has not violated the Constitution to warrant the call for his resignation after he had properly handed over to Acting President Yemi Osinbajo.

Jenson Button will return to racing next season but not in Formula One after spending one year too many in the sport, the Briton said on Friday. The 2009 world champion raced in the 'Suzuka 1000km' endurance race earlier this year as a one off, on the same circuit as this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix.Despite his desire to resume racing since giving up his seat at McLaren-Honda at the end of the 2016 season, the 37-year-old said that he had no qualms about leaving his Formula One career in the past. "Do I miss F1? No, I don't," Button told reporters on Friday."I miss racing. I'd sort of fallen out of love a little bit with motorsport. I think that maybe I left it a year too long, racing in Formula One." Button, who won his only world title with Brawn, raced in Formula One for 17 seasons.He remains the last driver to have won a race for McLaren, nearly five years ago at the 2012 season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix, and has stayed on as the team's ambassador and reserve driver. The 15-times grand prix winner made a cameo at this year's Monaco event, standing in for former teammate Fernando Alonso, who chose to skip the sport's blue riband race to compete in the Indy 500 instead.But Button has otherwise spent a majority of his time in the United States training for triathlons. "It's nice to have some free time and sort of look back on the last 17 years because while you're racing in F1 you don't do that," he said."It's been very emotional actually. It's been lovely and it's been necessary as well." However, Button added that his Suzuka appearance earlier in the year had rekindled his love for racing, just not enough to consider competing against the likes of Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel again."It's been a while since I've had that feeling so I've been itching to drive anything to be fair," said Button, who also ruled out racing in the American IndyCar single-seater series and Formula E. "So next year I'll be racing something. I don't know what yet, whether it'll be in America or in Europe or in Japan. But there are few options and I want to do a full season and take it properly seriously."
SUNNY ISLES BEACH, Fla. (AP) ¬ó Perched in trees and scampering down sidewalks, green iguanas have become so common across South Florida that many see them not as exotic invaders, but as reptilian squirrels.
Native to Central and South America, green iguanas that escaped or were dumped as pets have been breeding in the Miami suburbs and the Keys for at least a decade without making headlines like other voracious invasive reptiles such as Burmese pythons or black-and-white tegu lizards.
They¬íve been considered mostly harmless because they eat plants instead of native animals. But their burrows undermine seawalls, sidewalks and levees, and they eat their way through valuable landscaping as well as native plants. Their droppings can be a significant cleanup problem, as well as a potential source of salmonella bacteria, which causes food poisoning.
Compared with elusive pythons in the Everglades, iguanas are easy to spot. They can grow to more than 5 feet long, and they like what draws people to Florida: nice landscaping, waterfront views, swimming pools and sunbathing.

One iguana even stopped a first-round tennis match at this year¬ís Miami Open by crawling over a scoreboard onto the court. German player Tommy Haas snapped a selfie with it, but his Czech opponent Jiri Vesely complained to the umpire that he couldn¬ít concentrate. An ATP Tour video shows the umpire telling Vesely, ¬ìIt¬ís not a dangerous animal.¬î
Trapper Brian Wood easily caught three iguanas one recent afternoon, each roughly 3 feet long, basking on a condominium¬ís seawall in the resort community of Sunny Isles Beach. Using a long fishing pole, he looped wire around their necks, reeled them in, and placed them in a narrow metal cage.
Janet Sarno, board chairwoman at King¬ís Point Imperial Condo, hired Wood because the number of iguanas ¬ó big adults and bright green babies ¬ó hanging around the building¬ís pool has been growing despite residents¬í attempts to chase them away or block their entry.
¬ìMaybe 10 years ago, you might see one or two on the seawall. Now there¬ís 20 at a time coming out. There¬ís just too much,¬î she said.
The iguanas burrow under the seawall and first-floor patios, climb trees to reach second-floor balconies and eat the bright blooms off recently planted bougainvillea, Sarno said.
¬ìThey just come and they eat, they dig ... they¬íre in the pool,¬î Sarno said. ¬ìLately, there¬ís crap all over. It¬ís terrible.¬î
Wood primarily hunts alligators and tans their skins for luxury leather goods, but he¬ís received so many calls from homeowners seeking help with iguanas in the last several years that he created a pest control business called Iguana Catchers.
He wants to breed the iguanas he catches to sell hatchlings as pets in northern states with cold winters. In the meantime, he euthanizes them and sells their meat as a delicacy. He¬ís also trying to generate interest in iguana skins as a sustainable leather source, alongside alligator and python skins available in his Hollywood store.
¬ìThey¬íre like rats, they¬íre always going to be here,¬î Wood said. ¬ìI think it¬ís going to be a growing business.¬î
Not much threatens adult iguanas here except cars and cold weather, which has kept them from spreading farther north. Prolonged cold snaps in 2009 and 2010 killed off many of them ¬ó news stations showed frigid iguanas stiffly falling from trees ¬ó but the population rebounded. Scientists say development has only increased their preferred habitat.
The damage, cleanup and health concerns associated with iguanas, as well as their dramatic population growth, has prompted state officials to start thinking about management strategies.
¬ìCalls from residents about iguanas have increased, which pushed us to address them this year,¬î said Sarah Funck, non-native species program coordinator for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
In the Florida Keys, iguanas ate up the host plant for the endangered Miami blue butterfly in Bahia Honda State Park. Nearly 600 iguanas have been removed from the park in the last two fiscal years, according to Florida¬ís Department of Environmental Protection, but the quarter-sized butterflies haven¬ít returned.
State officials worry their digging may exacerbate long-term ecological damage if their burrows destabilize water restoration projects or flood-control structures near the Everglades. The South Florida Water Management District has reinforced some canal banks in Palm Beach County to prevent damage from burrowing iguanas, said Rory Feeney, the district¬ís land resources bureau chief.
¬ìBurrowing in these levees, particularly around structures, can cause hydraulic eddies and can increase erosion to our system,¬î Feeney said.
Florida wants to protect its smaller native lizards and keep green iguanas from becoming as big a pest as they have become in the Caribbean. In the Cayman Islands, researchers have confirmed with DNA evidence that green iguanas have hybridized with native iguanas.
On Grand Cayman, the adult green iguana population grew from 127,660 in 2014 to more than 400,000 last year, according to Jane Haakonsson, a researcher with the terrestrial resources unit of the Cayman Islands¬í environment department. An experimental hunt in July on the 22-mile-long island netted nearly 14,500 iguanas ¬ó 16 tons of carcasses ¬ó hardly enough to control them.
¬ìEveryone is complaining about it. Everyone has issues with their pools and their gardens, and on the roads they¬íre being run over all the time,¬î Haakonsson said. ¬ìA lot of the hatchings being born are surviving. What we¬íre doing is not stopping them.¬î

Lauren Brami, 24, graduated from the College of Charleston in 2015, looking to explore the world. She had studied in Paris for a semester and returned there after graduation. She taught English and traveled around the continent, meeting interesting people along the way. She often stayed with people who open up their homes to passing travelers for free, through an online platform called CouchSurfing.
Why did you want to go back abroad after college?
When I studied abroad I fell in love with Paris. It's really hard not to fall in love with that city. When I graduated from college, I knew that I wanted to go back to France so I found a program.
What was your program like?
The program is called TAPIF and it's the teaching assistant program in France run through the government. You work 12 hours a week, and you're helping English teachers teach their classes. I was teaching in two middle schools. One was in a city called Blois, and the other one was in the countryside, and they were very, very different.
What was so different about the two schools?
The kids in Blois thought they were the bad kids from the city and were kind of difficult. They didn't really want to learn English because they didn't see any point to it because they were in the middle of France and didn't think they'd ever need to use English. The ones in the countryside were completely in awe of a person who was not from France and wanted to learn about America and English and they were really excited about it.
Did the program come with housing?
It really varies where you're assigned. Some teachers will offer to house their teaching assistants if they have a spare bedroom. Some people will rent an apartment in the area. But I ended up staying in a student dorm kind of situation, which was probably the worst apartment I will ever live in. It was an efficiency apartment and it was comical. The guy who ran it was an old romantic French man and every time I had a problem he would try and woo his way into my heart with tales of his past and I would forget the reason I even went to go talk to him. It was quite the scene.
Where else did you travel to and which was your favorite?
I went to Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Budapest, I was all over. But my favorite trip was the one I took to Italy over spring break.
What kinds of places did you stay in when you traveled?
I was couch surfing in a few of the cities I visited. When you tell people you're couch surfing, they ask why you're doing that. But when you're really broke and you want to travel, you don't really have any other options, especially in cities that aren't super touristy, they might not have cheap lodging. Somebody had told me about couch surfing and I was like, all right, I guess I'll try it.
What was your most interesting couch surfing experience?
Italy was the first time I'd ever done it. The most poignant experience I had couch surfing was with this guy called Mossimo. He was just your very typical Italian man who would wake up singing opera in the morning and bring me an espresso. He was just a character. He took me around Bologna. I've met so many people from it and I still keep in touch with some of them today.
What's your biggest takeaway from the trip?
When I first went abroad, I really thought that I wanted to live in Europe for a while. Being there for an extended period of time, the romantic idea that I had about Europe the second time around kind of evened out a little bit. Especially since when I was there, the terrorist attacks were happening in Belgium and Paris, so that was a little shocking. I was ready to come back to the United States by the time I got back here, but now I'm kind of on that wanderlust train again and I'm itching to go back.

For reasons beyond my understanding, we as a society have turned our backs on grains. It's not a new thing, but it is becoming increasingly trendy to not only avoid eating grains like rice and bread (potatoes, while not a grain, are also a victim here) but also to create healthier, vegetable based dishes.
Out with the noodles and in with spiralized vegetables.
I happen to be in a very long-term relationship with bread. I certainly don't eat mountains of it, but I could certainly see myself winding up in a fist fight with Oprah over who loves bread more (she would win, I mean I'd see her and just be in awe of her). However, I am guilty of joining the vegetable substitution bandwagon. I make zoodles with pesto pretty often. I sometimes tease my friends by preparing buffalo cauliflower bites instead of making buffalo wings.
Given that this time of year there's an abundance of dense meals being passed around the holiday tables I thought it might be a good idea to try something to give my body a break from the series of bread rolls that have graced my plate.
I haven't tried to make fake bread yet, but I did attempt fried cauliflower rice to see if it could hold its own again fried rice.
As I've mentioned in a previous column, I'm very attached to my Chinese food, so the idea that I could snub regular rice and be some sort of health goddess by replacing it with shredded cauliflower was tempting. Admittedly I was hesitant to try this out, as I wasn't sure if there would be enough soy sauce in the world to stomp out the cauliflower odor and allow me to forget that I wasn't eating rice, but it turned out pretty well.
Fried Cauliflower Rice
Serves 4
1 head of cauliflower
2 tablespoons sesame oil
1 carrot
2 garlic cloves
2 eggs
2 tablespoons soy sauce
6 scallions
Shred the cauliflower with a cheese grater or a food processor until the pieces are the size of rice grains (pre-shredded cauliflower is also available in most grocery stores). Cube the carrot and dice the garlic (or if you have a jar of pre-minced garlic just use 2 tablespoons of that) and stir fry them in a skillet with the sesame oil over a medium low heat. After five minutes add the cauliflower and cook until it is tender. Once the cauliflower is tender, lower the heat and make a well in the middle of the pan. Crack the eggs in the opening and scramble them. Once the eggs are fully cooked add the soy sauce (low sodium works) and the chopped scallions and serve.
The rice is pretty simple, so feel free to add pork or edamame to the recipe. Or if you hate veggies, the recipe could be used to make regular fried rice by nixing the cauliflower for the real deal. Happy eating!
Death tolls in the devastating Assam floods has crossed 100 so far with 16 fresh casualties in the past 48 hours. According to estimates, over 85% of the Kaziranga National Park is submerged underwater and 22 lakh lives have been thrown out of gear in the 21 districts that have been badly hit with the incessant rainfall and landslides.Railway connectivity in the North East region is completely cut off.The annual floods hit the Northeastern state on August 10 this year and the situation is not likely to improve over the next few days. Before this, floods in June and July killed another 84 people across the state.Kokrajhar, Dhubri and Bongaigaon in western Assam and Kaliabor, Dhemaji and Dibrugarh in Upper Assam are the worst hit districts. The Indian Army has been deputed in these areas to rescue thousands who are stranded in the rising waters.According to data available with the Assam government, over two lakh people are living in 490 relief camps across the state. This comes even as seven rivers including Brahmaputra, Subansiri, Beki and others are still flowing above the danger mark.The flood situation in western Assam is likely to worsen further even as the meteorological department forecasts very heavy rainfall in the neighbouring Meghalaya and other parts of the state till Wednesday. The Kokrajhar belt which is already inundated in water flowing down from Bhutan, will also have to bear the brunt of more water flowing in from Meghalaya.Brahmaputra wreaked havoc in Koliabor sub-division in Nagaon district when the key Hatimura embankment was breached early on Sunday morning. It forced people to abandon their houses in the middle of the night.With portions of National Highway 37, which passes through Koliabor and leads to Kaziranga, submerged, it stopped all vehicular communication between Upper and Lower Assam.The rail link between Northeast and rest of the country snapped after railway tracks were hit at 12 different locations. While seven of them have been repaired, rest continue to remain inundated.Railways spokesperson, Pranav Jyoti Sharma said the situation has worsened. ‚ÄúWith railway tracks near Dalkhola, Barsoi, Sudhani stations submerged and the main line connecting the Northeast with the rest of the country blocked, the danger level further went up.‚ÄùSharma added, ‚ÄúAs a result, a number of trains had to be stopped at various stations and some other trains had to be cancelled or rescheduled/short-terminated. Some of the trains had to be brought back to their originating stations or other convenient stations.‚ÄùAssam has always been vulnerable to floods. With Brahmaputra valley being is one of the most hazard-prone regions in the country, more than 40% of the land in the state is susceptible to flood damages.In the last 50 years, Assam has already lost 7% of its land to soil erosion in the state's 17 riverine districts. Despite knowing that Brahmaputra is chipping away at the land, response by successive governments, has been tardy at best. Over Rs 30,000 crore has been spent on making embankments, but most of it turns out to be either insufficient or at times even counterproductive.
Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's populist scheme, Indira Canteen, is set to be inaugurated by the Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on 16th August.In the last budget, Siddaramaiah had announced Project Indira Canteen which envisaged providing affordable food to the poor in all 198 Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) wards.The authorities on ground had just four months to implement his vision and worked on war-footing starting from finding the suitable land in the ward to mobilising the funds.However, the project has run into controversy in many wards as the sites of the canteen were allegedly public places.In Chamrajpet, BBMP razed a portion of the compound of the 300-year-old Rameshwaram temple and faced serve backlash. So much so, the Chief Minister issued orders to civic authorities to rebuild the compound and change the location of the canteen.According to reports, near Cantonment Railway underpass where the structure started to take shape, the South Western Railway put up a board that the land belonged to them. However, the construction has still not stopped. According to BBMP, a MoU was has been signed with the Railway Department to use the land.In Murphy Town, a library which was housed a ‚Äòheritage' structure inside was demolished to make way for the canteen. Sensing backlash, authorities took down the building early in the morning.However, G Padmavathi, Bengaluru Mayor, defended what happened in Murphy Town. She said that the old reading room had become a den for men for illegal activities. The residents had complained about the place being misused. She also added that the Chief Minister had given instructions that no public places like parks, playgrounds can be used for the canteen space.‚ÄúBJP is creating ruckus, they are creating problem and opposing it because the canteen will come with Indira Gandhi logo. Common people are not opposing it, poor man who needs who is not against it,‚Äù she added.BJP MLA Suresh Kumar said that the Congress government was in a hurry to finish the constructions and has been going about it unilaterally. ‚ÄúCongress is not asking anyone for their opinion. Instead of every BBMP ward, they should have started first in every assembly constituency. There is arrogance and that's working against them,‚Äù said, Kumar.The canteen will be open to public from Wednesday with affordable breakfast at Rs 5 and lunch at Rs 10.

Everyone who has partied a little too much on occasion, or been on a diet of potato chips and salty fries (we all have), will be familiar with water retention. Even if the weighing scale doesn't show too much of a weight difference, we all experience the feeling of heaviness from time to time. While it's usually around your period or post a night of one too many drinks, a lot of other foods can cause that temporary inflammation, too. But if you experience water retention frequently, your diet might be to blame. Mumbai-based nutritionist Madhuri Ruia sheds light on everything you should keep in mind about the issue and the foods that cause it.
What exactly is water retention?
Water retention is an abnormal accumulation, an excessive build-up of watery fluid inside the body's circulatory system, tissues and cavities. Our body is 70 per cent water, which means that our blood, body's organs and muscles are all made up of it. Water retention or accumulation is a result of inefficiencies of hormonal and physiological processes that interrupt the processes of excretion of water from the kidneys and result in its accumulation.
What are the most common causes of water retention?
Leaky capillaries or blood vessels; physical inactivity or standing repeatedly, for long hours; protein deficiency and a diet heavy in refined sugar and salty foods are some of the most common reasons why unwanted water accumulates in your body.
But isn't a lot of water good for you?
About three to four litres of water are required for the body's metabolism to work effectively. However, just drinking water is not enough, we need a rich array of nutritious food in our diet and healthy eating practices, as well as regular exercise that prevents water from accumulating out of turn in the body's tissues.
How can your diet cause water retention?
Salty foods, like papad, pickles and sauces with extra sodium as well as refined foods and sugar retain water within the tissues. A diet high refined foods including white sugar, maida and in some cases, even wheat, increases blood insulin levels which in turn increase sodium and water retention. A high carb, fruitarian diet that eliminates protein reduces albumin levels in the body, which can also cause this concern.
If you're already suffering from water retention, these are the foods you need to avoid: refined foods, cakes, pastries, white bread, refined pastas, pizzas, wheat products including whole wheat if it is severe, fruit juices, aerated beverages, cured and smoked meats like salami and sausages, packaged soups and meats that are stored in brine.
Can changes to your diet help reduce the puffiness?
Include egg or skimmed paneer, yoghurt and poultry in your diet if you are non-vegetarian. Eat more leafy greens including spinach, parsley and arugula, peppers and salads, and healthy fats like pumpkin seeds, almonds, desiccated coconut and flaxseed as snacks. It's a good idea to consume seafood like tuna and salmon and to include coconut milk in your gravies. Replace the 20 per cent of recreational calories, which include sugar sweeteners, with more nutrient-dense versions like pure maple syrup, which is rich in magnesium and does not cause insulin spikes when consumed in moderation.
How do you keep yourself fit when suffering from water retention?
First things first, know that it is a temporary condition that you can overcome. Your diet should include all the foods mentioned above at regular intervals. For instance, a balanced meal would look like this: egg and nachni roti with peppers for breakfast, palak paneer for lunch, almond and maple yoghurt with tea and broccoli soup and tuna with quinoa for dinner. Try to include three days of resistance training and three of cardio for a minimum of 40 minutes to strengthen the circulatory system. Ten minutes of trampolining is especially good for strengthening the one-way valves of the calves to prevent water retention in the legs.

Last month, Queen announced a deluxe box set celebrating the 40th anniversary of their 1977 album News of the World. In the press release, the band promised ‚ÄúEvery lead vocal is different, as are most of the lead guitar parts and a great many other instrumental details.‚Äù Now Queen has revealed the reissue versions of ‚ÄúWe Are the Champions‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe Will Rock You,‚Äù two of the band's best-loved songs.

Dubbed the ‚ÄúRaw Sessions Versions,‚Äù the tracks are prototypes for the songs we know: Freddie Mercury's vocals are a bit looser on ‚ÄúWe Will Rock You,‚Äù which begins with a few warmup bars of singing. Brian May's guitar solo is quite different, too. You get the sense that Queen were feeling their way through the tracks as they recorded earlier versions. The piano arrangement on ‚ÄúWe Are the Champions‚Äù is brighter and happier.
The News of the World box set debuts November 17. Listen to the never-before-heard raw sessions here:
Chorley recorded their first away win in the National League North since January 7 to boost their play-off prospects thanks to a priceless goal from Andy Teague.
The skipper struck the killer blow midway through the first half to secure the Magpies' second 1-0 win of the Bank Holiday weekend.
Chorley opened brightly and following a poor clearance from the goalkeeper Jake Cottrell had a shot kicked off the Celtic line.
For Stalybridge, James Roberts angled a good effort just past the far post before Matt Jansen's men were unlucky not to go in front when Dale Whitham's 20-yard rocket crashed down off the underside of the bar.
Chorley did go ahead on the half hour when from Whitham's cleverly placed free kick Teague looped a header beyond keeper Grant Shenton into the far corner.
Roberts continued to threaten for Celtic firing just past the far post and then heading inches over following an Andy Bishop flick-on.
But at the other end, Marcus Carver broke through and tried to bend a shot beyond Shenton only for the keeper to palm the ball aside at full stretch.Whitham had an early shot charged down after the break but there were few signs of a goal at either end though Chorley keeper Ritchie Branagan did pull off one fine save diving to his right to parry a shot from Celtic sub Christian Platts.
The Magpies' well-marshalled defence saw out the closing stages comfortably enough to take a step closer to the play-offs.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton and Prince William, welcomed their third child on April 23, 2018, at 11:01 a.m. London time. Middleton gave birth to a son, fifth in line to the throne, born after just five hours of labor. And like every royal birth, fans are anxious to know all the details surrounding Kate, her new baby, and her childbirth experience. So, what is hypnobirthing? Kate Middleton reportedly decided to bring her youngest son into the world in the most zen way possible, and, apparently, she's not alone.
A hypnobirth, according to Women's Health, is an assisted birth utilizing the practice of tapping into the subconscious and relying on instincts to achieve relaxation that's "free of the resistance that fear creates." In other words, specially-trained practitioners teach a form of guided meditation to help promote a calmer, more serene ‚Äî sometimes even pleasant ‚Äî birthing experience. The "Mongan Method," widely used by celebrities, is inspired by the work of Dr. Grantly Dick-Read, an English obstetrician and author of Childbirth Without Fear. Marie Mongan M.Ed., M.Hy., hypnotherapist and Harvard University Ford Foundation fellow, developed the technique with both mom and baby in mind. Her philosophy is based on the belief that the bodies of mom and baby were meant to do the whole childbirth thing and can work together to create a harmonious experience.
According to Mongan, during a hypnobirth you're "awake throughout, you will be aware of your body's surges and your baby's progress; but because you will have trained yourself to reach complete relaxation, you will be able to determine the degree and the manner in which you will feel the surges." Practiced deep breathing, visualization, prompts from laboring partners, and labor comfort measures are all used in harmony to elicit a peaceful birthing experience.

Kristen Olberz, R.N., C.H., H.B.C.E., labor and delivery nurse at Portland Providence Medical Center and a certified HypnoBirthing educator, tells Fit Pregnancy that a hypnobirth "supports moms being OK with what's going on during labor" as they're "fully supported by staff and loved ones" and are "feeling safe and empowered." She goes on to add that some of the most important aspects of labor and delivery can't be "realized" if you're frightened or letting the pain control the way you labor.
In the event a mother goes into labor with the intent to hypnobirth, but circumstances ‚Äî such as emergency medical intervention ‚Äî change, the tools hypnobirth employs can still be used. You can still go through the breathing exercises, your birthing partner can still guide you through meditations, and you can still feel somewhat in control. Just having the tools can ease laboring fears, even if things don't go according to plan.
A large component of hypnobirthing relies heavily on the fact that the laboring mom remains calm during times of high-intensity stress in order to help the uterine muscles relax. This prompts the release of oxytocin and endorphins, which ease laboring pains, shorten the first stage of labor, and lessen post-birth fear and/or anxiety. The practice doesn't necessarily eliminate the need for alternative pain relief, but merely facilitates a calmer atmosphere for bringing a baby into the world.

Medical Daily describes the practice similar to "daydreaming or intense focus." While this method may not appeal to everyone, and it doesn't promise the complete elimination of pain, it does promote a fear-free process that can allow your muscles to do their job "as nature intended." Stress hormones, they say, are what constrict muscles and the body in general, causing added pain and making labor more difficult than it needs to be.
Still not sure if hypnobirthing is for you? Dr. Lorne R. Campbell, Sr., Clinical Assistant Professor of Family Medicine at University of Rochester, penned the foreword to Mongan's book, HypnoBirthing: The Mongan Method: A natural approach to a safe, easier, more comfortable birthing, which spoke to the importance of hypnobirthing and included the following: "I now truly believe that normal birthing does not have to involve pain." No matter what your birth plan includes, all women deserve a more peaceful birthing experience.

Criminals looking to find or sell sex online now have fewer places to turn. But, some experts worry sex-trafficking victims may be at greater risk than before.
Prominent websites used by sex-traffickers are shutting down, now that a new law leaves them legally-exposed. "And that's exactly what we intended," said Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio).
Portman helped steer the legislation through Congress, and watched on as President Donald Trump signed it into law.
Sex-traffickers already faced penalties, but now sites like 'Backpage' and 'CityVibe' where they advertised, are no longer immune to criminal prosecution or lawsuits from victims.
"By signing this today Mr. President, you will make a huge difference in the lives of so many, women, girls, [and] boys going forward," Portman said during the signing.
Portman said the next step in the fight against trafficking is to provide more services to help former victims get back on their feet.
About 95 percent of lawmakers on Capitol Hill voted for the new law. Despite its popularity - researchers like Kim Mehlman-Orozco said the new law creates more problems than it solves. She's served as an expert witness for prosecutors and defense attorneys, written books on the subject, and teaches at George Mason University.
"In my interviews with sex traffickers and pimps, and commercial sex consumers, they have told me unequivocally, this changes nothing," Mehlman-Orozco said.
Online or on the street, Mehlman-Orozco said shutting down sites only makes criminals harder to find. She said ads are moving to social media, password-protected sites, and pages run overseas - beyond the reach of U.S. law enforcement. "Which will further inhibit law enforcement's ability to find those ads, to rescue those girls and to catalyze those arrests of sex traffickers," she said.
Mehlman-Orozco said Congress should focus on funding digital law enforcement efforts, and forcing webpages to inform rat-out questionable users.
Both Portman and Mehlman-Orozco expect those in the online sex-trade to adapt. Some sites that are down - like 'USAsexguide' - are already promising to be back online in just days.
An explosion of unknown origin took place in the New York City subway near the Times Square area of Manhattan on Monday, according to several media reports. A pipe bomb that was strapped to a man went off, injuring the suspect and three others on the platform at the height of the morning rush hour, law enforcement officials.

One person was taken into custody by New York Police Department while subway lines A, C and E lines were being evacuated, the New York City Police Department tweeted.
The person on the platform was being treated for non-life-threatening injuries, The Associated Press reported.
The explosion, which happened around 7:30 am, triggered a massive emergency response by New York police and fire both above and below ground, tangling subway and bus service at the nearby Port Authority bus terminal.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders has tweeted that President Trump has been briefed on the explosion.
Video from above the "Crossroads of the World" showed lines of police and emergency vehicles, their lights flashing, lining the streets and no other vehicle traffic moving.
Everything around the Port Authority in the 42nd Street area was shut down ‚Äî a surreal scene of still at what would ordinarily be a bustling rush hour.

New Delhi: The Delhi High Court today granted former Union Minister P Chidambaram interim protection from arrest till 3 July in the Central Bureau of Investigation's (CBI) INX Media corruption case.
Justice A K Pathak asked Chidambaram to join and cooperate in the questioning session as and when called by the CBI.
The court also sought the investigating agency's response on the Congress leader's anticipatory bail plea and listed the matter for further hearing on 3 July.
Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, opposed the anticipatory bail plea saying he was merely called for questioning.
Chidambaram had yesterday rushed to a trial court for protection from arrest in Aircel-Maxis case before approaching the Delhi High Court in connection with the INX Media case, in which he has been asked by probe agencies to join investigations.
Chidambaram's role has come under the scanner of investigating agencies in the Aircel-Maxis deal of Rs 3,500 crore and INX Media case involving Rs 305 crore. It was during his tenure as finance minister in the UPA-1 regime that FIPB clearance was granted to the two ventures in which alleged irregularities have been found.
In the INX Media case, the CBI had registered an FIR on 15 May last year against alleged irregularities in the FIPB clearance to INX Media for receiving overseas funds to the tune of Rs 305 crore in 2007 when Chidambaram was finance minister.
Chidambaram's son Karti Chidambaram was also arrested in the matter for allegedly receiving funds to the tune of Rs 10 lakh in the case.
The other accused in the case include then INX Media Director Indrani Mukerjea and then INX News Director Peter Mukerjea

New Delhi: "Human life is worth much more than the right to employment," the Delhi High Court said on Tuesday while referring to a 2013 incident of fire in a shoe factory in Mangalpuri which killed three young men and a minor boy, and injured a workman.
The observation by a bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar came during the hearing of a PIL seeking compensation for the victims from the authorities for their failure to stop functioning of such illegally operating units.
The Delhi government, represented by its counsel Ramesh Singh, told the court that there is a 2011 policy which provides for compensation of Rs 2 lakh for an adult's death, Rs 1 lakh for a minor's death and Rs 50,000 for serious injuries as a result of such incidents.
The court, however, observed that with the passage of time the compensation policy also needed revision and asked the Delhi government to have a re-look at it.It directed the Delhi government to file an action taken a report regarding the compensation released to the victims. A direction was also issued to the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, in whose jurisdiction the factory was located, to file an affidavit on what compensation it would disburse to the kin of the victims.
The direction was issued by the corporation in an earlier status report had admitted its culpability in permitting the factory to operate illegally.
The court ordered the Station House Officer of Mangolpuri police station to trace the next of kin of the victims and to produce them before the sub-divisional magistrate of the area. The PIL was filed in connection with the fire which broke out in the early hours of March 12, 2013 in a shoe factory at Mangolpuri and in which three young men, Kuldeep (22), Chander Shekhar (20) and Raj (24), and a 13-year-old boy, Salman, were killed and a workman, Mithlesh (18), was seriously injured.
The petitioner, a lawyer, has contended in her petition that the state cannot abrogate its responsibility in the matter and ought to pay compensation to the victims.
Las Vegas is preparing to be the first city in the nation with vending machines dispensing clean needles in an effort to help combat the spread of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV, while also possibly leading some drug users into treatment.
Three machines will be available for users starting in May. The pilot program is a coordinated effort between Trac-B Exchange, the Southern Nevada Health District and the Nevada AIDS Research and Education Society to discourage the sharing of needles among users.
Trac-B Exchange program director Rick Reich said that to participate in the vending machine program, users would have to fill out a form for the sponsoring groups and obtain an eight-digit identification number to ensure confidentiality and track their use. Each kit will contain sterile syringes and needles ‚Äî along with a compartment for used needles that can be disposed of safely at the machines.
But unlike snack, soda or movie rental machines left in open spaces, these $15,000 machines will be located inside the three facilities and would be accessed only during the hours the buildings are open for business. Reich said the cost of each kit was under $10, but they would be free for users.
Reich said putting one of the vending machines inside the Community Counseling Center of Southern Nevada was designed to allow some drug abusers to interact with trained counselors if they decided they wanted to get help.
Patrick Bozarth, executive director of the counseling center, said his staff had been undergoing training in anticipation of reaching drug abusers who may use the vending machine and learn about treatment options.
‚ÄúI think we're optimistic it will help,‚Äù Bozarth said. ‚ÄúBut it's such a new program and we want to make sure we're prepared.‚Äù
Needle exchange programs have been used successfully throughout the world, with several nations adopting vending machine technology into their mix to curb the spread of blood-borne pathogens.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported the effectiveness of needle exchange programs, and the North American Needle Exchange Network counts 228 syringe service programs in 35 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.
The CDC reported on a study that looked at the effects of New York's exchange program on the prevalence of hepatitis C infection between 1990 and 2001, and found the needle exchange program reduced the disease's prevalence from 80% to 59% among intravenous drug users.
Needle and syringe possession was illegal in Nevada up until 2013, when the state Legislature repealed the law. Pharmacies can sell needles and syringes but have discretion about who can purchase them.
Reich said the machines helped remove some of the stigma faced by users who felt uncomfortable during transactions with pharmacists ‚Äî some of whom may question why the syringe and needle are needed.
‚ÄúVending machines are not born with a bias,‚Äù Reich said. ‚ÄúIt doesn't have a personality and doesn't care how you look when you approach it.‚Äù
Jenny Gratzke, disease investigator and intervention specialist with the Southern Nevada Health District, said there were an estimated 5,800 injection drug users in Clark County, a number she believed was low.
Most of the users, she said, are either injecting heroin or methamphetamine, with a smaller number shooting up cocaine. A small percentage of needle users, she said, are transgender people using hormones or steroids.
Gratzke said she hoped users took advantage of the vending machines, but she acknowledged the initial rollout faced some challenges.
‚ÄúIt does take time to gain the trust of the community,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe people who are injecting the drugs have been stigmatized, and so I think they may be a little hesitant initially. But once it catches on, I think it will be beneficial for everyone involved.‚Äù

A TOOWOOMBA man will be hoping third time really is lucky after his second attempt at bail was denied in the Toowoomba Magistrates Court today.
During the hearing, police prosecutor Rowan Brewster-Webb told the court that Reece James Boxshall was caught in the act and arrested by three off-duty police officers eating breakfast in a Toowoomba cafe earlier this year.
Some of his 10 charges, including entering a dwelling at night and attempted stealing, were allegedly committed just 10 days after he was granted bail on other matters - the court heard.
He was also on parole at the time.
"He has most certainly used up the graciousness of the court," Mr Brewster-Webb said.
His lawyer argued that some of the charges may not hold up to scrutiny given Boxshall was arrested by officers not technically on the clock, something Mr Brewster-Webb said would fall short given they are "technically always on duty".
Magistrate Viviana Keagan denied the 28-year-old bail and ordered that his matters be adjourned to be heard back in the same court on July 18.
More drugs and guns have been seized in the tri-region, after RCMP executed a search warrant on a storage locker in Stony Plain on May 17, marking the second such seizure in just one month.
Inside the storage locker, RCMP found two rifles, ammunition and a loaded high-capacity magazine. That seizure led to the arrest of Jeffrey Ryan, 31, of Parkland County, who was found to be in possession of 5.8 grams of Fentanyl, 16 counterfeit Oxycodone tablets ‚Äî suspected to also be Fentanyl ‚Äî Cocaine, Methamphetamine and drug trafficking paraphernalia.
Ryan was charged with a number of offences including using an imitation firearm in the commission of an offence, possession of property obtained by crime, and various drug and weapon offences. He is currently being held in custody with a court date set for May 30.
On May 7, RCMP executed a similar search warrant on a storage locker in Parkland County, resulting in the seizure of two AR-15 rifles, firearm suppressors, high-capacity magazines and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. RCMP also found large amounts of GHB (a liquid drug occasionally used as a date-rape drug), Methamphetamine and Cocaine.
RCMP did say that while they can't say that the cases aren't connected in someway, they stated that at the present time they don't have any evidence to suggest that the two offenders were working together or connected in any way.
If you want a modern-day definition of uncomfortable, you surely don't have to look any farther than U.S. President Donald Trump at the official White House Easter Egg Roll yesterday, hosted this year by the (oh-so-living of the middle class) Trump family.
‚ÄúWe're going to come out and join you, and enjoy your company for a roll,‚Äù said the president from his papal-like perch overlooking the White House lawn.
‚ÄúI'm coming down ‚Äî my whole family is here.‚Äù
And boy, did the First Family, complete with young Barron in tow, look thrilled to be taking part.
READ MORE: The War on Easter that wasn't
Trump also commented on the crowd size, reiterating as usual, ‚ÄúWe're going to have a lot of people here.‚Äù
Apparently the crowd was smaller than in past years, but that was apparently largely due to the shortage of White House staff to host the event, positions the Trumps have yet to fill.

The authorities at a regional passport office in Lucknow have okayed the passport issued to the inter-faith couple Tanvi Seth and Anas Siddiqui in the city as per the new rules of the Ministry of External Affairs.The clearance was granted as the Local Intelligence Unit (LIU) did not file any adverse report related to the six points mentioned in the new passport verification rules.Speaking to News18, Regional Passport Officer, Piyush Verma said, ‚ÄúThe new proforma for Police verification is implemented with effect from June 1, 2018 and which is confined only to criminal verification and citizenship of the applicants. There are no adverse reports on those 6 points proforma, therefore it cannot be considered as adverse.‚ÄùLast week, the Lucknow police filed an adverse report saying Seth has been living in Noida for the past one year and not the Lucknow address she mentioned in her application form, after which it was speculated that Tanvi Seth could be served a notice and her passport could also be revoked.The incident was first reported by News18 when Siddiqui and Seth were allegedly harassed and shamed by passport officer Vikas Mishra, who then rejected their application.Hours after Seth tweeted to External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, secretary of the ministry DM Mulay took cognizance of the matter and assured ‚Äúappropriate action‚Äù.Union Minister, Sushma Swaraj was also abused by a few Twitter users, who took umbrage at the minister for instructing the passport office to take action against the accused officer. However, her Cabinet colleagues and senior BJP leaders Nitin Gadkari and Rajnath Singh supported her and said it was unfortunate that Swaraj received abusive messages.

| CARACAS
CARACAS Venezuelan opposition lawmakers on Wednesday said security forces used excessive violence during a raid to capture protesters in a sprawling middle-class apartment complex carried out after officers came under fire.Videos taken during the raid show an armoured truck smashing through the gates of the Los Verdes complex, in an operation that Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said resulted in the capture of 23 people who had been involved in attacks on security forces."These subjects were involved in violent acts in which several officials were injured by gun fire," Reverol said, describing clashes at a barricade close to the apartments as the trigger for the raid.Los Verdes is located in a Caracas neighbourhood that has been the site of almost nightly clashes over two months since protests broke out against government restrictions on the opposition and chronic shortages of basic consumer goods. With at least 68 killed since April, the increasing intensity of protests and the government response has led some to warn that Venezuela risks descending into deeper political violence.
The government calls violent protesters "terrorists" who want to overthrow President Nicolas Maduro, and says that acts including attacks on police, the burning of vehicles and a looting and arson attack on a court building this week delegitimize their cause.Dozens of car windows were smashed and at least 12 elevators broken during the operation on Los Verdes, said a Reuters witness at the site on Wednesday. One resident said an agent shot her dog in the eye.
"They are mafia criminals armed by the government," said opposition lawmaker Tomas Guanipa, describing as "vandalism" the government action at the complex, which houses some 4,500 people. Small protests and clashes rumbled on in several parts of Caracas and other cities on Wednesday, with security forces firing tear gas to clear a roadblock in a wealthy part of the capital and protesters burning a car.Reverol said two people were killed in an accident when one motorcycle hit another after turning back from an opposition barricade on Wednesday.
The opposition street movement has been fanned by Maduro's plan for July 30 elections for a special assembly to rewrite the constitution, which critics say are stacked in the government's favour and will result in the opposition-controlled congress being dissolved.The opposition is determined to stop the vote, calling instead for a presidential election. In a sign of how heated rhetoric has become, opposition lawmakers warn the situation could descend into armed conflict if protesters are not heard."If this government insists on going ahead, the world needs to know, sadly, what is coming here is a major war for the Venezuelans," said lawmaker Juan Requesens at a sit-in protest blocking a Caracas highway on Wednesday.

Student societies sent unsolicited packages containing everything from electronics to sex toys
Some of the items that have mysteriously been sent to Camosun College Students Society in recent weeks. (Photo submitted)
A pair of Victoria student societies are on the receiving end of what would appear to be an expensive practical joke.
Student societies at the University of Victoria and Camosun College have been receiving mysterious parcels in recent weeks, containing everything from electronic items to sex toys.
‚ÄúI wouldn't say anything's worth over $50 at this point, but it's pretty substantial,‚Äù said Michael Glover, Camosun Student Society services co-ordinator. ‚ÄúWe got a turntable that plugs into USB, but none of us have any records.‚Äù
He said they've probably received 30 or 40 items in all over the past three months or so, all coming in Amazon packaging.
‚ÄúWe've talked to Amazon to try and find out what's going on and they're as perplexed as we are,‚Äù said Glover.
Pierre-Paul Angelblazer, UVic Student Society's interim director of outreach and university relations, said they have also been receiving numerous packages for the past few weeks.
‚ÄúThey're generally fairly valuable things,‚Äù he said, adding the first packages were donated to the campus food bank.
‚ÄúWe're continuing to get the packages but we're just turning them away and having them shipped back to Amazon. We're not opening the boxes anymore.‚Äù
Glover says Victoria schools aren't alone in receiving the mysterious packages, as he's heard of schools around B.C. and across the country who have been receiving them.
He said the student society hasn't decided what to do with all of the merchandise that includes a dash cam, a pair of HDTV antennas, fishing tackle and sex toys.
‚ÄúWe've got about $1,000 worth of merchandise here. If they're sending them to 100 student unions, that's $100,000 [not including the shipping],‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAmazon is winning, someone is winning, but what all this junk is for ‚Ä¶ I have no idea. We'll go fishing later? Some lucky student will win a vibrator?‚Äù
Glover said the latest shipment arrived on Thursday, and the student society is just waiting for the issue to resolve itself.
‚ÄúFor us it's kind of neat ‚Äì it's like ‚ÄòOh, what did we get today?' And if you need an HDTV antenna in black or white, we're your guy.‚Äù
Meat Loaf last played Victoria on June 25, 2016. That may be the last time you'll see him perform live.
In a new interview with Rolling Stone, Meat Loaf said health issues may keep him off the stage. ‚ÄúI haven't been able to sing in a year,‚Äù the 70-year-old said. ‚ÄúYou use everything to sing, and I just cannot do it.‚Äù
On that 2016 tour, Meat Loaf almost didn't make it to Victoria. The singer collapsed onstage during a concert in Edmonton. At the time he blamed dehydration but in the new interview, he said pain was shooting down his back ‚Äúlike a sword.‚Äù
Meat Loaf is still acting. He currently stars in the B.C. filmed series Ghost Wars. But that might be it for touring and recording new material.
‚ÄúMy back is driving me crazy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut then I'm probably a little crazy anyway.‚Äù

It's only a few weeks until the 20th anniversary of Princess Diana‚Äòs death, and the documentaries and tell-alls are popping up across TV networks.
One documentary in particular ‚Äî National Geographic's Diana: In Her Own Words ‚Äî boasts audio from never-before-heard secret recordings, taped in 1991 at Kensington Palace for a biography about her life.
Diana: In Her Own Words features archival footage of the late royal with her ex-husband, Prince Charles, and her two boys, Princes Harry and William, in various stages of childhood. The visual imagery will be overlaid with Diana's voice, played directly from the transcriptions.
READ MORE: Princess Diana TV special set to examine death conspiracy theories
She discusses a variety of topics, including how she and Prince Charles met, his relationship with now-wife Camilla Parker Bowles, her personal battle with bulimia and her occasional thoughts of suicide. Of course, she describes at length how the pressure of suddenly becoming a royal was almost unbearable.
Diana is very candid on her courtship with Prince Charles, saying at the beginning, he was ‚Äúall over [her] like a rash.‚Äù
After the pair were married, Diana describes an isolation from both her own family and her new royal family; this is when she developed bulimia.
‚ÄúEverybody knew about the bulimia in the family,‚Äù she says in the recordings. ‚ÄúThey all blamed the failure of the marriage on the bulimia, and that's taken some time to get them to think differently.‚Äù

In one of the more jaw-dropping confessions, Diana says she confronted Bowles about the affair she was having with Prince Charles.
‚ÄúI'm sorry I'm in the way,‚Äù she supposedly said to Bowles. ‚ÄúI'm in the way, and it must be hell for both of you. But I do know what's going on, don't treat me like an idiot.‚Äù
Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, has reportedly reached out to Britain's Channel 4 and asked them not to air the recordings due to the pain it will cause her sons.
‚ÄúThe excerpts have never been shown before on television and are an important historical source,‚Äù said a spokesperson for Channel 4. ‚ÄúWe carefully considered all the material used in the documentary and, though the recordings were made in private, the subjects covered are a matter of public record and provide a unique insight into the preparations Diana undertook to gain a public voice and tell her own personal story. This unique portrait of Diana gives her a voice and places it front and centre at a time when the nation will be reflecting on her life and death.‚Äù
Princess Diana died in a car crash in Paris, France, on Aug. 31, 1997.

‚ÄòDiana: In Her Own Words' airs on National Geographic on Monday, Aug. 14 at 9 p.m. ET.
The Conjuring universe is getting bigger by the minute. New Line has just given the green light to another spin-off in the form of The Crooked Man. The character made his horrifying debut in The Conjuring 2 and is now the second character to get a spin-off from that movie, following Valek the nun.
The news comes courtesy of The Hollywood Reporter, which means you can pretty much take it to the bank. The Crooked Man does not yet have a director, but up-and-comer Mike Van Waes has been hired to pen the script based on a story by James Wan, who directed both The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2. As THR puts it, James Wan is serving as the "chief architect of the Conjuring universe". The Crooked Man, a tall, slender, horrifying creation, isn't based on much, but the character comes from an English nursery rhyme which, hopefully, Van Waes can make use of in the story.
"There was a crooked man, and he walked a crooked mile. He found a crooked sixpence upon a crooked stile. He bought a crooked cat, which caught a crooked mouse. And they all lived together in a little crooked house."
Those who are looking forward to seeing The Crooked Man join The Conjuring universe may be wondering who Mike Van Waes is. He doesn't have a lot of produced work to go on, but his stock has been rising lately. New Line recently bought his pitch for a horror movie set in the world of The Wizard of Oz. His movie Hammerspace was also purchased by Warner Bros. after making it onto the Black List, which is a list of the best unproduced screenplays in Hollywood. The Conjuring is a very important franchise for Warner Bros./New Line, so they wouldn't just let anyone write something that could be a huge moneymaker. At this point, the universe has been built on the backs of promising new talent.
New Line is doing one hell of a job building out this Conjuring cinematic universe so far. Annabelle came out in 2014 as the first spin-off and, even though critics and fans did not enjoy the movie, it made an incredible $256 million worldwide with a budget of less than $7 million. Later this year, Annabelle 2, Annabelle: Creation, will be looking to add to the box office total, while also, hopefully, doing a little better with critics and fans. With director David F. Sandberg (Lights Out) at the helm, that seems likely. Director Corin Hardy (The Hallow) is also working on The Nun right now, which will center on the terrifying nun Valek from The Conjuring 2 who, interestingly enough, was a last-minute addition to that movie.
To date, The Conjuring franchise has made $895 million worldwide and, considering the relatively modest budgets these movies carry, that makes this a monster franchise. The Conjuring 3 is also still being planned, but no release date has been set and it isn't clear if James Wan will return to the director's chair. We will be sure to keep you up to date as more information on The Crooked Man is made available.

The government's drive against black money and the success of the demonetization drive figured prominently in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Independence Day speech on Tuesday.Modi said Rs 3 lakh crore, which was earlier not included in the banking system, got deposited after the ban on high value notes in November last year.Interestingly, Modi said this number was computed by ‚Äúoutside experts‚Äù as neither the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) nor the government has yet given out the exact figure of money deposited during or right after demonetisation.‚ÄúRs 3 lakh crore of additional money came in‚Ä¶ the government didn't do this research, outside experts say this‚Ä¶ this money came into the banking system because of demonetisation,‚Äù Modi said while hailing the drive as an example of what Indians can achieve.An economist with a multinational bank said the figure was of the rise in bank deposits and is not necessarily black money.‚ÄúThis number also includes money that was not reported, but not necessarily black money. It could be money that your grandmother or grandfather kept under the mattress for a rainy day, but which they had to deposit after the notes were demonetized,‚Äù explained the economist, who wished to remain anonymous.Pronab Sen, former Secretary of the Statistics Ministry said the Prime Minister may have added the outside experts caveat because officially the government has not yet released the exact figures.On November 9, 2016 the Prime Minister announced denomination of Rs 500 and 1,000 notes. This constituted around 86% of the total currency in circulation, amounting to Rs 15.4 lakh crore. Some unofficial reports indicate that 97% of the demonetized currency made its way back.Harping on his government's efforts towards eradicating black money, Modi said that in the last 3 years Rs 1.25 lakh crore of illicit cash had been unearthed. The Prime Minister also said that Rs 1.75 lakh crore that came into banks post Demonetization is ‚Äúunder suspicion‚Äù and the Income Tax department is investigating this cash.Modi said that 18 lakh Income Tax assesses were found to have disproportionate income and a quarter of these have provided an explanation for this and accepted their mistake.Modi also said that around 3 lakh shell companies were found to be engaging in hawala transactions and the registrations of 1.75 lakh companies had been cancelled.
An Inland Empire woman was sentenced to 30 days in jail and three years probation after pleading guilty this week to two misdemeanor charges in connection with a series of vehicle burglaries in Laguna Beach.
Laguna Beach detectives launched an investigation June 3 after receiving multiple vehicle burglary reports in the northern part of the city.
During the investigation, police identified Rachel Alvarez, 28, of Redlands and Johnny Cervantez, 22, of San Bernardino as two possible suspects, said Sgt. Jim Cota.
Detectives interviewed Alvarez in Redlands, where she confessed to her involvement in the burglaries and handed over stolen property, which included a laptop that belonged to a schoolteacher, Cota said.
Detectives searched Cervantez's residence in San Bernardino, where police said they found additional stolen property.
Alvarez pleaded guilty in Orange County Superior Court on Monday to grand theft and receiving stolen property, both misdemeanors. She also was ordered to pay restitution, according to court records.
Cervantez is facing charges of possession of a controlled substance paraphernalia, possession of a controlled substance, receiving stolen property and grand theft, all misdemeanors.
Cervantez was released on his own recognizance and has not yet entered a plea. He is scheduled to be arraigned July 24, according to court records.
Detectives are continuing to investigate and pursue additional suspects in connection to the case, Cota said.
‚ÄúIn almost all of these cases, the victims left their vehicles unlocked. Crooks enjoy the path of the least resistance, and it is much easier to target victims who do not protect their property,‚Äù Capt. Jeff Calvert said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe best way to prevent crimes of opportunity is to secure your belongings and hide valuables from the public view.‚Äù

RIO DE JANEIRO - A Brazilian nursery school guard burned six small children and a teacher to death after spraying them with alcohol and setting them alight Thursday in an attack which has horrified the nation.
Dozens of people were also hurt in the blaze while the guard, who was reported to be mentally ill, died after succumbing to his own burn injuries. The tragedy occurred in a modest quarter of Janauba, a city of 70,000 about 600 kilometers (370 miles) north of Belo Horizonte city. The nursery school was called "Innocent People."
The initial death toll of four rose to six when two badly burned kids died, according to news reports which quoted fire officials. Janauba's mayor decreed seven days of mourning.
About 50 people were hospitalized with injuries, said Bruno Ataide Santos, director of the local hospital.
Hours later, 10 people remained hospitalized in serious condition.
The guard, who was aged about 50 and identified as Damiao Soares, died in hospital several hours after the incident, which left him with burns all over his body, Santos told AFP.
About 80 children were in the nursery school when the attack occurred, prompting terrified parents to rush to the school, where they found one classroom reduced to ashes.
"As the creche is near our house we heard noise and rushed over," Nelson de Jesus Silva, the father of one victim, told Globonews TV.
"My little girl was so good, so smart," he said of his dead daughter Ana Clara Ferreira.
Grief also struck Jane Kelly, the mother of Juan Miguel Soares.
"I was thinking of changing nursery schools because we are preparing to move. I woke him up early to bring him here and when I saw him again he was dead in the hospital," Kelly said between sobs.
The dead children were aged four, the G1 news site reported.
Police visited the home of the suspect and his family members to try to determine a motive.
But police superintendent Renato Nunes told the website of the Hoje em Dia newspaper that the guard had had mental health problems since 2014.
The guard had worked nights for at least eight years at the nursery school, where he was not directly in contact with the children.
Janauba's mayor Carlos Isaildon Mendes said an even greater tragedy was narrowly averted.
"This could have been worse because the babies' room was in the hall next door. Evacuation would have been more difficult. As the children were bigger a lot of them were able to escape," the mayor explained.
Police searched the guard's home and found many jugs of alcohol. He reportedly told his family this week - which includes the anniversary of the death of his father - that he was going to give a "gift" to them and that he would die.
Brazil's President Michel Temer expressed his condolences on Twitter.
"I am deeply saddened by this tragedy involving children in Janauba, and I want to express my solidarity with the families," Temer wrote.
As the father of a school-age child, Temer said he understood "this must be an extremely painful loss" for the parents.
Careful what you wish for.
Hartlepool United fans wanting Craig Harrison to be picking up his P45 before Christmas are growing in number and in volume.
The supporters, promised a promotion campaign, are being fed not just defeat after defeat, but thrashing after thrashing.
Poolies are furious and it's hard not to agree with them.
This truly is unacceptable, there is no other word for it.
Well, there are other words for it but not ones which can appear in print in these pages of SportMail.
Saturday's 4-0 subsidence at Dover Athletic did not speak voumes about where Pools have ended up, it screamed them.
For a team who dominated play and possession to come away on the wrong end of a four-goal ‚Äòbeating' beggared belief. If the goals conceded to Macclesfield seven days earlier were excruciating then this was even worse.
An opener on two minutes when Pools needed a solid start to heap pressure on an out-of-sorts Dover was followed by an all-too-simple second.
Mitch Pinnock got both and goals three and four late on, from Ryan Bird, were also too easy as he was given the freedom of the six-yard box.
Pool fans sang ‚Äúyou're not fit to wear the shirt‚Äù at the Crabble Athletic Ground to the players, though Harrison is the focal point of their fury. That is no shock, he is the gaffer.
He should be under pressure, certainly under pressure to deliver results, because Pools being down in 14th is a scandal.
But what would the sacking of a man in charge for just six months achieve? That's even assuming Pools would.
Can the club afford it? You suspect not. Harrison would have to be paid up, presumably along with assistants, Paul Jenkins, Matthew Bates and Bernard Hirmer. Then there is the compensation required to bring in a new boss ‚Äì surely the better ones will be in work?
You then have to stump up the readies for the new manager and his own backroom staff and then hope he hits the ground running.
There are other risks. Remember when Pools sacked another Craig, Hignett, and replaced him with Dave Jones. A fantastic CV, but no idea about League Two. He proved a complete disaster.
Now is the time for Pools, their owners and, dare I say, the fans to hold their nerve and keep the faith.
If Pools are to have any chance this season they need the sort of run they enjoyed post-Guiseley when they went along at an average of two points per game.
Fans, management and players, I've gone in alphabetical order, dug Pools out with a team effort and that's where it's going to have to come from again. The players have to launch the revival by going back to basics.
They must mark, track, tackle, block, save, shoot. Just those six things which were absent in Kent, I'm not asking them to donate a kidney.
The misery began on two minutes when Pools stood and watched as Pinnock exchanged passes unchecked with his friends before shooting early, Scott Loach being beaten badly at his near post.
Bird went close to a second after another neat home interchange while Loach made amends with a super diving save from Manny Parry's header. But the keeper was culpable again as Dover doubled the lead in the 25th minute.
Louis Laing was robbed too easily by Anthony Jeffrey who crossed low into the six-yard area where Pinnock slotted in from a few yards. The goal was all-too-similar to the Macclesfield equaliser.
Loach is a class keeper, some of his saves this season have been breathtaking, he's a class act as a fella, but a revival surely begins at number one?
Thereafter, to say Pools dominated and Dover barely got a touch would be no exaggeration. The away side were in total control of possession ‚Äì they won the corner count 11-3 ‚Äì and they played with passion and confidence ... until they got to the home area.
Rhys Oates had a shot blocked, Liam Donnelly was denied by a decent save from Mitch Walker who got down to hold a shot from sub Tomi Adeloye. Jack Munns could not connect to a Conor Newton cross as well.
The Crabble pitch was not in great nick so why weren't Pools shooting on sight? This reporter could be wrong but I think, Donnelly (with three) and Carl Magnay (two) had the most chances, the skipper's late piledriver produced a stunning Walker save with the ball heading into his top right corner. That is not right. The attacking players must take more responsibility.
Sure enough, when Dover had the sight of goal again, they scored in the 79th minute. Laing was turned inside out by sub Kadell Daniel whose cross was headed in by Bird from inside the six-yard box.
Bird made it four in injury time, this time with his right foot, when no one bothered to mark him at Pinnock's free-kick.
Pools were down to 10 men at that point after Nicky Deverdics was dismissed when he caught Connor Essam with his right arm. It was untidy but hardly the elbowing the ref suggested. It merely resulted in another addition to the cock-up catalogue, and this time it wasn't Pools.
The club must not compound it by axing the boss now ‚Äì the team must be given a chance to turn it around, although they can't leave it too long.
United Nations: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has started a 100-day countdown to the International Day of Peace, with a strong appeal to citizens, governments and leaders worldwide to "put peace first."
Guterres on Wednesday said the International Day, marked annually on September 21, "embodies our shared aspiration to end the needless suffering caused by armed conflict", reports Xinhua news agency.
The Secretary-General said: "It is a day on which the United Nations calls for a 24-hour global ceasefire, with the hope that one day of peace can lead to another, and another, and ultimately to a stilling of the guns."
The UN chief explained that there is more to achieving peace than laying down weapons.
"True peace requires building bridges, combating discrimination and standing up for the human rights of all the world's people."
The theme for this year's International Day of Peace is "Together for Peace: Respect, Safety and Dignity for All" with a particular focus on the plight of refugees and migrants throughout the world.
Guterres urged everyone - over the next 100 days - to remember that millions of vulnerable members of our society, many of whom have lost everything, need our understanding and assistance.
The International Day of Peace, unofficially known as World Peace Day, was first celebrated in 1982.

BEIJING-Beijing woke on the first morning of the New Year covered in thick toxic fog, with a concentration of harmful particles 20 times higher than international standards.
After a long period of pollution in December, the Chinese capital was again smothered Sunday in an acrid grey haze which limited visibility to a few hundred metres.
Luminous signs on top of the skyscrapers seemed to float in the fog, while some tourists wore respiratory masks.
Levels of PM 2.5 - microscopic particles harmful to human health - exceeded 500 on Sunday morning, according to US Embassy estimates, vastly above the maximum threshold of 25 recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for a 24-hour exposure.
On Sunday the exasperation of people in Beijing overwhelmed social networks.
‚ÄúWhy didn't they trigger the red alert? Because it would be a bad omen for the first day of the year?‚Äù wrote a surfer on the Weibo microblogging platform.
‚ÄúPollution now has its hukou (residence permit) in Beijing. It's made. It will never leave again,‚Äù replied another.
Most of China's greenhouse gas emissions come from the burning of coal for electricity and heating, which spikes when demand peaks in winter and is the main cause of smog.
Between December 16-21, Beijing along with some 30 other major cities in northern China was on ‚Äúred alert‚Äù, a maximum alarm level triggered when severe pollution is likely to last more than 72 hours.
Across the region, construction sites and schools closed and authorities reduced the number of vehicles allowed on the roads in hopes of reducing the thick haze.
On Friday and Saturday 24 Chinese cities in the north and east were again placed on red alert, according to media reports.
Almost all of the alerts were dropped on Sunday, according to official sites, with the notable exception of various districts of Shijiazhuang, the capital of the highly industrialised province of Hebei, where in mid-December pollution was 40 times the maximum recommended WHO threshold.
The issue is a source of enduring public anger in China, which has seen fast economic growth in recent decades but at the cost of widespread environmental problems.
According to official meteorological predictions, the pollution haze will disperse ‚Äúprogressively‚Äù from January 5.
China has set a target of reducing its annual coal capacity by 800 million tonnes, according to a government plan reported Saturday by state media.
Despite the target, Beijing expects total coal output to rise to around 3.9 billion tonnes by 2020, compared to 3.75 billion tonnes in 2015, the official Xinhua news agency said, citing a document from the country's top economic planning body.
(Adds analyst quotes, details throughout; updates prices) * Canadian dollar at C$1.2426, or 80.48 U.S. cents * 1.3 percent drop for the currency is deepest since January 2017 * Loonie touches its weakest since Jan. 23, at C$1.2438 * 10-year yield reaches the highest intraday since May 2014 By Fergal Smith TORONTO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar suffered it the sharpest drop in one year against its U.S. counterpart on Friday after a pickup in U.S. wage growth boosted the greenback, while multi-year highs for bond yields pressured global stock markets. At 4 p.m. EST (2100 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading 1.3 percent lower at C$1.2426 to the greenback, or 80.48 U.S. cents, its biggest drop since January 2017. "The Canadian dollar is getting hit from all sides today," said Adam Button, currency analyst at ForexLive in Montreal. "Equities are tumbling, commodities are softer and the U.S. dollar is jumping due to an outstanding employment report." U.S. job growth surged in January and wages posted their largest annual gain in more than 8-1/2 years. The data helped push the U.S. dollar higher against a basket of major currencies as expectations rose that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates three times this year. All three major U.S. stock indexes tumbled, pressured by prospects of higher inflation and climbing bond yields. "The Canadian dollar needs a strong global economy to flourish and stocks are having second thoughts," Button said. The currency's strongest level of the session was C$1.2256, while it touched its weakest since Jan. 23 at C$1.2438. For the week, the loonie fell 0.9 percent. U.S. crude oil futures settled 0.5 percent lower at $65.45 a barrel. Oil is one of Canada's major exports. Speculators raised bullish bets on the Canadian dollar for the fourth straight week, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed. As of Tuesday, net long positions had risen to 33,465 contracts from 22,557 a week earlier. On Wednesday, the loonie touched its strongest level in four months at C$1.2250. Canadian job growth in 2017 was revised slightly higher, data from Statistics Canada showed, confirming a stellar year for the country's labor market. Canadian government bond prices were mixed across the yield curve. The 10-year rose 3 Canadian cents to yield 2.361 percent. Its yield touched its highest intraday level since May 2014 at 2.392 percent. The gap between Canada's 10-year yield and its U.S. equivalent widened by 7.4 basis points to a spread of -48.3 basis points, its widest since Dec. 20.

A murder investigation has been launched after an aspiring actress fell from the 19th floor balcony of a luxury London tower block.
Bethany-Maria Beales, 22, died after plunging from The Heron, a 36-storey residential skyscraper, over the Bank Holiday weekend.
Her body was found with "significant injuries consistent with a fall from a height" on a sixth-floor communal terrace on Saturday.
City of London police have arrested a man and a woman, both aged 38, on suspicion of murder. They have since been bailed.

Miss Beales' family have paid tribute to their "shining star" who studied drama at the University of Roehampton.
In a statement they said: "Beth was a kind, funny, loyal, intelligent, talented and stunningly beautiful person who changed the lives of everyone fortunate enough to know her and lucky enough to be loved by her.
"She was more than a daughter, grandaughter, niece, cousin, stepsister, step-auntie, goddaughter or friend. She was the world to us all.
"She had the brightest smile and the most beautiful singing voice. She was our songbird.
"She had an amazing talent that, if it had been seen by the world, would have become known to millions.
"To say we will miss her does not come close to describing how we feel. Our world will never be as bright again now that our shining star has gone."

A police spokesperson said: "The City of London Police have arrested two people on suspicion of murder after the body of a woman in her 20s was found in an open area of the Heron building on Moor Lane on Saturday 26 May 2018.
"Bethany-Maria Beales, 22, from London was found with significant injuries consistent with a fall from a height and died at the scene.
"A man and a woman, both aged 38, from London were arrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday 26 May and Sunday 27 May respectively.
"They have both since been released on conditional police bail whilst the investigation into the circumstances of this incident continues.
"A post-mortem took place on Monday."

Detective Chief Inspector Edelle Michaels said: "We would like to extend our thoughts and condolences to Bethany's family and friends at this difficult time and reassure them we are doing everything we can to determine the circumstances of this tragic incident.
"Anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or may have information which can assist our investigation is asked to contact police as soon as possible.
"We are particularly keen to speak to anyone who was in the Heron building, or the vicinity, on Saturday that may have seen or heard something."
A mill nearly as old as Canada must be sold if it is to survive, its owner says, since the spring flood has just washed through it, and through her hopes of creating a bed and breakfast.
The mill on Brennan's Creek in Old Killaloe has been there since 1870. Owner Anette Clough says it's part country home, part storehouse of history.
"It has a pile of stuff in there: Manual wooden planes, sickles, big wagon wheels, things that fit around a horse's neck." There is equipment for sending flour down a chute into bags, and flour sifters, all pushed to one side of the building.
The other side is renovated: a three-bedroom home on the top two levels, and a smaller apartment with a separate entrance.
She and her soon-to-be ex-husband bought it about four years ago. The couple eventually split; she moved out two years ago and her husband left last fall. The mill has been unoccupied since then.
"I would love, love, love to keep the place. It's an incredible building. I would really love to turn it into a bed and breakfast," she said Monday.
Previous owners blasted out bedrock and put in a 50-kilowatt turbine that generates electricity for sale to the provincial grid. At least it did until a flood three years ago. Clough figures the turbine itself is still fine, but the turbine room may need electrical repairs.
"We almost had it ready to turn on, we had all the electricals checked and cleaned, and then we got flooded three years ago. And that is because we didn't have enough stop logs pulled out of the dam," she said.
With the couple splitting up, she can't afford to invest more money in repairs that are needed in one foundation wall, or in putting the turbine system back into shape.
It's a lovely setting, with a pond behind the dam, walking trails and a foot bridge to the far side of the creek.
"I haven't put it on the market yet because I haven't been wanting to sell it because I really love it. But looking at what happened this year..."
Last week, the rising runoff water spilled past the dam and through the first floor of the mill, in one door and out another.
Clough said a structural engineer looked at the mill since then, recommending repairs to one foundation wall and an overall review of the building when water levels drop.
Stop logs work like plugs in a drain, meaning they can be dropped into position in a dam or lifted out to control how much water can flow through. They are intended to be lifted out in fall, so that the spring flood has an opening where it can rush right through. But the logs are heavy, and Clough and her husband couldn't remove them all last fall, so the dam was partially blocked. Then spring came.
The result is familiar to anyone who has tried to flush a blocked toilet: Water backs up and overflows. It's now receding.
The Killaloe Post, an online magazine that's largely the work of local photographer Lynn Flokstra, recently traced the history of the mill that was built by an Irish immigrant in 1849, and rebuilt after a major fire in 1870.
"At its peak the mill was powered by one wood- and one water-powered engine and was in operation 24 hours a day grinding the wheat harvest for local farmers," the Post notes. "When flour was no longer profitable they ground grain for livestock feed. With the rise of national commercial mills local grain milling became a thing of the past."
The mill had a second life sawing and planing lumber from the 1940s until 1968.
If no one maintains the building, Clough says, "it could get worse, and then the town and the area lose something that has been there forever and is really amazing."

Moviegoers bid adieu to 2016 and welcomed in 2017 over the four-day holiday weekend, spending about $200 million to see just the 10 top-grossing films, a pack led once again by ‚ÄúRogue One: A Star Wars Story.‚Äù
The continued forceful showing by Disney's ‚ÄúRogue One‚Äù was expected to add $64 million to its total by the time the weekend drew to a close, bringing its domestic total to $439.7 million, according to figures from ComScore.
That would make it the second-highest-grossing film of 2016 after only 18 days in theaters, behind another Disney enterprise, ‚ÄúFinding Dory,‚Äù which has taken in $486 million during the year. Globally ‚ÄúRogue One‚Äù has grossed nearly $775 million through Sunday, ComScore reported.
See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour ¬ª
Close behind ‚ÄúRogue One‚Äù over the holiday weekend was Universal's new animated musical comedy ‚ÄúSing,‚Äù with an estimated four-day take of $56.4 million to bring its two-week domestic box office total to $180 million.
The film featuring the voices of Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Seth MacFarlane, Tori Kelly and others at the top of its cast fared modestly with critics, posting a 69% positive score at rottentomatoes.com and a 60 (out of 100) at Metacritic.com aggregate movie review sites, but faring noticeably better with audiences, who awarded it an A rating, according to the audience polling site Cinemascore.com.
The worldwide total for ‚ÄúSing‚Äù through the weekend is expected to hit $285 million, Universal officials estimated.
Those runaway hits are contributing to what industry sources are projecting to be a record year at the box office. Movie executives are expecting total domestic box office revenue to hit $11.3 billion when all is said and done, up from $11.14 billion a year earlier.
That news is tempered by the expectation that the number of tickets sold remained essentially flat in 2016 compared to 2015, and that because of the increase in movie streaming, studios are continuing to see profits drop from home video sales.
Also in its second week of release, Sony Pictures' sci-fi thriller ‚ÄúPassengers,‚Äù starring Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt, placed third with an estimated four-day take of $20.7 million, having earned a B rating from fans but getting hammered by critics, scoring a 36% favorable rating at rottentomatoes.com and a modestly better 41 on Metacritic.com.
Disney retained a second film in ComScore's Top 5, with ‚ÄúMoana‚Äù continuing to pull in moviegoers in significant numbers after six weeks, adding an additional estimated $14.3 million during the New Year's weekend to elevate its domestic total above the $200 million mark to $213.4 million. It is barely shy of the $400 million mark globally, Disney officials report.
Rounding out the Top 5, Fox's comedy ‚ÄúWhy Him?‚Äù starring Bryan Cranston and James Franco, posted an estimated four-day gross of $13 million, bumping its two-week take to $37.6 million.
‚ÄúWhy Him?‚Äù demonstrated another notable divide between fans and critics, moviegoers giving it a B+ rating at CinemaScore, while critics questioned its merits with a 38 rating on Metacritic and a 40% favorable score at Rotten Tomatoes.
One of the best-reviewed films of 2016, Paramount's screen adaptation of August Wilson's play ‚ÄúFences,‚Äù lands at No. 6, with a four-day estimate of $12.7 million in its third week, raising its domestic total to $32.4 million.
In reprising their roles from the Broadway production, using Wilson's own screenplay, stars Denzel Washington, who also directed, and Viola Davis wowed critics and fans alike. ‚ÄúFences‚Äù earned a 95% positive rating at Rotten Tomatoes and a 78 on Metacritic, and an A- audience grade at CinemaScore.
Doing even better on both fronts, Lionsgate Films' ‚ÄúLa La Land,‚Äù the L.A.-based movie musical with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, took in an estimate $12.3 million while still in limited release on 750 screens, compared with those that outgrossed it in general release and playing on more than 2,500 screens.
Its four-week domestic total has reached $37 million as director Damien Chazelle's latest is poised to open wide on Friday on more than 1,500 screens. Audiences have given it an 89% positive rating at Rotten Tomatoes, while critics are even more enthusiastic about it, awarding it a 93% positive rating.
‚ÄúLa La Land‚Äù also took honors for highest per screen average of the 10 highest-grossing films, taking in an estimated $16,440 per screen over the holiday weekend, according to ComScore.
After two weeks of release, Fox's video game adaptation ‚ÄúAssassin's Creed‚Äù logged an additional $10.9 million for the four-day weekend, putting its domestic gross to date at $41.9 million.
Despite the presence of acclaimed actors including Marion Cotillard, Jeremy Irons and Charlotte Rampling, along with star Michael Fassbender, the time-jumping tale of a secret society sworn to safeguarding no less than the free will of humanity received a dismal 16% positive response on Rotten Tomatoes and 36 on Metacritic, while largely winning over fans and earning a B+ at CinemaScore.
At No. 9, director Kenneth Lonergan's ‚ÄúManchester by the Sea‚Äù is another late-in-the-year critical darling, scoring 97% positive reviews at Rotten Tomatoes and a 96 at Metacritic, while audiences have scored it as 82% favorable at Rotten Tomatoes.
The RSA Films release posted an estimated gross of $5.5 million for the four-day holiday weekend, pushing its domestic gross to just under $30 million in seven weeks.
Completing the Top 10, Warner Bros.' Harry Potter series spinoff, ‚ÄúFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,‚Äù brought in an estimated $5.4 million, also in its seventh week in theaters, which puts its domestic gross to date at $225.4 million.

Report: Prince Harry Invited Obamas To His Wedding And Guess The Orange Fool Who Didn't Get An Invite
New Delhi: Congress is not the main player in many states and regional adjustments, based on the ground realities, have to be worked out during elections in which there can be no "macro-level" understanding, CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury has said.
"The diversity of our country reflects in everything, including politics. Now, SP and BSP get together in Uttar Pradesh. Neither the Left, nor the Congress is of any consequence (there). The same thing happened in Arariya (in Bihar)," he told PTI in an interview after being re-elected to the post at the CPM's Congress in New Delhi which concluded on Sunday.
To questions about putting up a joint fight against the BJP, he said in several states, the Congress is "not the main player."
"That is why every front or (political) formation in India takes place only after elections. There will be regional adjustments. There will be regional level understandings. It cannot be a macro-level understanding. Political leaders also should realise this", he said.
Soon after his re-election at the party congress, Yechury began receiving hundreds of congratulatory messages, tweets and phone calls from various people including top leaders of the Congress, BSP, SP, and other Left and Opposition parties.
While thanking them, he said some opposition party leaders called including Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, BSP chief Mayawati and senior leaders of Samajwadi Party and other parties. Congress leaders have also tweeted and called.
"I am really grateful to all of them. All of them are hoping that we will all work together," Yechury said.
Yechury, who was re-elected the CPM general secretary for another three-year term, had been targeted by a section of his party for his "minority view" on having an understanding with all secular democratic forces including the Congress to jointly take on the BJP.
His political viewpoint was later adopted at the congress, the highest decision-making body of the party, as its officially approved political line.
He said "what will be done during elections depends on the ground realities ... The central committee would then take a decision".
"But the question of any front or alliance with the Congress was never been the case earlier and would not happen now too," Yechury said.
Talking about the prevailing political situation and the challenges of defeating BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls, Yechury said though his party has always been the key element in the formation of an alternate government like United Front or the UPA, it has never been part of the government but given outside support.
"During Emergency, we never became part of the Janata Party government or the United Front ... We were key element forming that front but we were never there in the government. We gave outside support to that government.
"Even to the UPA, we gave outside support again. We have to keep in mind that both United Front and the UPA were formed after the elections. Our support from outside was based on a common minimum programme," Yechury said.
He said it was only after the common minimum programme was drafted that "we gave our support. That's what we mean to say that it will depend on the policies.
"We have a long experience on all these fronts, but our decision is always to support them based on policies".
To questions on the differences that came out in the open within the party at the five-day congress here, Yechury is confident that the CPM would work unitedly towards the goal of defeating the BJP.
"Party congress has decided what our line is. So now there cannot be any minority or majority. There should not be."
"The collective (political) line of the entire party has been decided now. So that is what there will be.... a united party moving on the basis of the political line we have adopted at the congress", Yechury said.
New Delhi: Economists on Monday suggested a range of measures, including increasing social security pension, to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley as part of pre-budget consultations.
"The amount (for social security pension) has been Rs 200 per month. This is totally unacceptable. There is no reason to keep it so low. So, make it at least Rs 500, I would say even Rs 1,000, if possible and increase the coverage," noted economist Jean Dreze said after the meeting here.
Asked if social security pension is raised it would result in stress on fiscal deficit, he said, "this is peanuts. This is nothing".
He also suggested full-fledged implementation of maternity entitlements. This has been pending for four years. Former Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Virmani said the government should carry out customs and exim duty reform as the sector has not seen reforms for 10 years.
According to Rathin Roy, member Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, the government is expected to stick to fiscal deficit target.
"I think there is a political commitment (to do this). I reinforced that. I am sure they will. I said that we understand that there is a genuine commitment to maintain the fiscal deficit and revenue deficit targets. Operational constraints may vary but political commitment is there," Roy said.
Besides, some economist also recommended imposition of long term capital gains tax on equity, sources said, adding interest rate also figured during the meeting along with rural distress and job creation.
Even the Reserve Bank of India at several occasions has asked banks to pass on the rate cut quickly through the repo rate reduction to consumers but banks are reluctant to do so for some reason or other.
Besides Jaitley, the meeting was also attended by top finance ministry officials, including Finance Secretary Hasmukh Adhia, Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian, Expenditure Secretary A N Jha and Financial Services Secretary Rajiv Kumar.
NEWARK, N.J. (AP) ‚Äî Mario Batali is giving up oversight of the daily operations at his restaurant empire following reports of sexual misconduct by the celebrity chef over a period of at least 20 years.
The online site Eater New York, part of Vox Media, reported Monday that the incidents involve at least four women, three of whom worked for Batali. The women, who were not named in the Eater story, claim that Batali engaged in behavior including groping one's chest and grabbing one from behind and holding her tightly against his body.
In a prepared statement sent to The Associated Press, Batali said that the complaints ‚Äúmatch up‚Äù with his past behavior.
‚ÄúI take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family,‚Äù Batali said.
A spokesperson for Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group says an employee reported inappropriate behavior by Batali in October. The company told Eater it was the first formal complaint against Batali and that he was reprimanded and required to attend training.
Batali will also take leave from his ABC cooking show, ‚ÄúThe Chew.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe have asked Mario Batali to step away from The Chew while we review the allegations that have just recently come to our attention,‚Äù the network said Monday. ‚ÄúABC takes matters like this very seriously as we are committed to a safe work environment. While we are unaware of any type of inappropriate behavior involving him and anyone affiliated with the show, we will swiftly address any alleged violations of our standards of conduct.‚Äù
The allegations against Batali are just the latest in a series of incidents that include Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Louis C.K., Matt Lauer, resignations in the U.S. House and Senate and calls again for President Donald Trump to address sexual misconduct allegations that he's faced. Last week Time magazine named the ‚Äúsilence breakers,‚Äù those that have shared their stories about sexual assault and harassment, as Person of the Year.
The 57-year-old Batali was well known in culinary circles, taking jobs early in his career as a sous chef at the Four Seasons in Santa Barbara and San Francisco.
His career took off after opening Po in New York City in the early 1990s, and he skyrocketed to fame with the airing of ‚ÄúMolto Mario,‚Äù a show that ran on the Food Network for eight years, until 2004. It was there that his signature look, a fleece vest, shorts, and orange Crocs, became instantly recognizable to most people.
The Food Network, which was planning to relaunch ‚ÄúMolto Mario,‚Äù said Monday that it was placing its plans on hold. ‚ÄúFood Network takes matters like this very seriously,‚Äù the network said in a statement.
Batali also co-owns restaurants in a handful of cities. The Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group owns or operates several restaurants, including Babbo in New York, Carnevino Italian Steakhouse in Las Vegas and Pizzeria Mozza in Los Angeles. It's also a partner in Eataly, an Italian food hall and grocer, which has locations in New York, Chicago and Boston.
Batali has long been socially active. The Mario Batali Foundation advocates child nutrition. He has come out forcefully against hydraulic fracturing, a method used to extract oil and gas.

THE USPTO grants patents at record rates, but patent litigation is falling every year. That's because the certainty associated with granted patents is decreasing.
‚Äú‚Ä¶the certainty associated with granted patents is decreasing.‚Äù3 days ago came a new press release which speaks of a ‚Äúnew chief licensing officer‚Äù in InterDigital, a company whose entire ‚Äòbusiness' is patent shakedowns. We are guessing that they have trouble. IAM took note of that. There are lots of turbulence and resignations (the ‚Äúrats jumping the sinking ship‚Äù so to speak) in the patent trolls ‚Äòindustry' these days, with many examples of that. We have been covering several in the past few months. Now, according to IAM, a few of these entities go east. ‚ÄúTu joins an organisation that, as well as former Ericsson chief IP officer Kasim Alfalahi [he is a patent troll] at its head,‚Äù IAM said about the Marconi Group on Friday.
So they will try their luck in China, the ‚Äònew' Eastern District of Texas.
‚ÄúSo they will try their luck in China, the ‚Äònew' Eastern District of Texas.‚ÄùWhat we found noteworthy is this report about Nokia, sent to us also by two readers. Nokia is fighting against Linux/Android with patent blackmail ‚Äòon behalf' of Microsoft; it specifically targets companies that Microsoft could never successfully shake down with patents, notably Apple and Huawei [1, 2]. As the report puts it: ‚ÄúThe Finnish telecoms equipment maker said on Thursday its fourth-quarter profit grew by 7 percent to 1 billion euros from the previous year, helped along by a patent payment from China's Huawei.‚Äù
Earlier (this morning) we found another report of interest. The Microsoft-connected Intellectual Ventures tops the chart in ‚ÄúPatent Trolls Activity Update: Transport Zone 2017‚Ä≥ from Unified Patents (published a short while ago). To quote a couple of portions:
NPEs continue to pose a serious risk to automotive companies and account for 72 percent of litigation in 2017. The majority of these threats came from Patent Assertion Entities (entities whose primary purpose is patent assertion), however auto companies also faced threats from a small handful of individual inventors. [...] Figure 5: 2017‚Ä≤s most frequent plaintiffs for the Transport zone Intellectual Ventures (14 assertions)
Somaltus LLC (12 assertions)
Magnacross LLC (11 assertions)
Location Based Services, LLC (9 assertions)
Blue Sky Networks, LLC (8 assertions)
As we have been pointing out for a while, Microsoft likes to arm and unleash trolls at its competition, in order for people to run to Microsoft for perceived ‚Äòsafety' [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. We gave another example a month ago and days ago. Another serious antitrust probe should be in order. ‚ñà

A 35-year-old villager was shot dead by Indian Army personnel in Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh on Wednesday, media reports said. The army claimed it was a case of "mistaken identity".
Sources say a man shot dead by Army in Arunachal Pradesh. More details awaited. ‚Äî ANI (@ANI_news) June 15, 2017
According to NDTV, Thingtu Ngemu was shot dead by the troopers of 21 para-special forces during a counter-insurgency operation on Wednesday night. Operations have been intensified in the area since it is a transit route for both NSCN-K terrorists and Ulfa (I).
According to the NDTV report, the army released a statement saying, "The army troops had laid an ambush in this particular area based on hard intelligence with regards to the movement of a group of hardcore terrorists. It was during this time the individual, who was killed, came into the ambush and on being challenged he made very suspicious movements and rushed towards the ambush party, which forced them to open controlled fire resulting in the individual suffering fatal injury. It is a case of mistaken identity." On 10 June, Union minister Kiren Rijiju had said most of the demands of the pro-talk faction of the ULFA are "worth considering" and a final solution is expected "very soon". "The peace talks with the Arabinda Rajkhowa faction of the ULFA is going on very well and with confidence. We genuinely feel that maximum demands by the pro-talk Arabinda Rajkhowa faction are worth considering," the minister of state for home affairs had said. But social media users on Twitter were enraged about the attack.

US Army Military Auxiliary Radio System (MARS) Headquarters is recommending that MARS members ‚Äúmigrate to stand-alone computer systems for [MARS] radio operations,‚Äù subject to the availability of a dedicated computer.
‚ÄúThese computer systems (or their associated local area networks) should be ‚Äòair-gapped' from the internet,‚Äù Army MARS Headquarters Operations Officer David McGinnis, K7UXO, said in a message to members. ‚ÄúAlthough not a requirement for membership at this time, we will continue make this a condition of certain parts of our exercises.‚Äù
McGinnis pointed to remarks by Cisco researchers in a recent Ars Technica article about VPNFilter malware: ‚ÄúHackers possibly working for an advanced nation have infected more than 500,000 home and small-office routers around the world with malware that can be used to collect communications, launch attacks on others, and permanently destroy the devices with a single command.‚Äù
McGinnis told Army MARS members that MARS Headquarters does not discuss specific cyber threats with MARS members or with the public. ‚ÄúWe also cannot confirm or deny information about specific threats,‚Äù he said, adding that he had ‚Äúno specific knowledge‚Äù about VPNFilter malware and no comment on the Cisco report.
For communication exercises this year, MARS established conditions for a certain portion of the drill that requires use of standalone computer systems ‚Äúnormally not connected to the internet.‚Äù
MARS member and software consultant Steve Hajducek, N2CKH, has recommended that members using the MIL-STD (military standard) Data Modem Terminal (MS-DMT) communications software employ stand-alone computers in conjunction with the software as a best practice for achieving a high level of performance. McGinnis said discussion of stand-alone computer systems on Hadjuceks's support forums and their use in communications exercises let Army MARS Headquarters weigh in on the discussion. He pointed out that the MARS mission assumes that an internet connection is not available. He said used or refurbished PCs are widely available at low cost and could be dedicated to serve a stand-alone function.
‚ÄúThe most effective way to protect against threats that come from the internet is to isolate from the internet,‚Äù McGinnis added.
‚ÄúDespite a stand-alone environment, we assume that all computer systems in private citizens' hands are infected with hostile software code of some sort and are not secured,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNo amount of virus and malware scanning software changes that assumption. We can, however, isolate computers by disconnecting them from the international network in which hostile software will report and receive instruction.‚Äù
McGinnis said future versions of MARS software will check for an internet connection and will disable the software. ‚ÄúWe understand this lock-out does not provide security in and of itself; rather, its value is in changing the behavior of members,‚Äù he explained.
He encouraged MARS to monitor for internet security threats and determine how to secure their internet-connected and stand-alone devices.
MARS Program Manager Paul English, WD8DBY, told ARRL that the MARS goal is to isolate MARS members' computers from the internet as much as possible. ‚ÄúHaving stand-alone computers running as few other resources than MARS-related software improves the overall MIL-STD system software performance and further isolates computers from infections, malware, and hacking,‚Äù he said. English added that isolating the computers that members use for MARS-related activity is ‚Äúa goal, but has not been directed.‚Äù
The Edmonton Oilers have kept the San Jose Sharks off the scoreboard for six straight periods in taking a 2-1 Stanley Cup series lead.
While that puts the spotlight on Edmonton goalie Cam Talbot, he is quick to share the credit.
‚ÄúCan't say enough good things about the guys in front of me the last couple of games,‚Äù Talbot said Monday after a practice in preparation for Tuesday night's Game 4.
‚ÄúI mean, we've given up less shots in the last two games combined than we did in the first game alone. We really tightened it up on the back end, not giving them much off the rush.‚Äù
READ MORE: Edmonton Oilers blank San Jose Sharks 1-0 in NHL playoffs
San Jose fired 44 shots on net in its 3-2 overtime win in the series opener, but totalled only 39 in its two losses.
The emphasis on team defence that is paying off now has been part of the Oilers philosophy since Todd McLellan took over behind the bench before the 2015-16 season.
‚ÄúIt was pretty obvious it was something that needed to happen,‚Äù McLellan said. ‚ÄúWhen you threw the numbers at the group two years ago when we started, Edmonton had a reputation of playing real fast, get on offence and see what happens. That doesn't win at this time of the year and I think we're proving that.‚Äù
The year before McLellan arrived, the Oilers had given up an average of 3.37 goals per game, the highest of any NHL team. This season, that figure was down to 2.52 per game, eighth best in the NHL.
Three of the six Edmonton defencemen charged with containing the Sharks this series are finishing their first season with the Oilers. The biggest acquisition came last June when the team acquired Adam Larsson from the New Jersey Devils for popular forward Taylor Hall.
Kris Russell and Matt Benning also signed as free agents, but it was the trade for Larsson that got the most attention from critics who thought the Oilers gave up too much for too little.
‚ÄúThe outside noise occurred one, because Taylor Hall's a tremendous hockey player,‚Äù McLellan said, ‚Äúand two, not many people knew a lot about Larsson. He wasn't a well-known quantity out west.
‚ÄúWe believed he could come in and help us, and I believe he's certainly met our expectations. Not only as he made our team better, but he's made people around him better.‚Äù
READ MORE: Edmonton Oilers trade Taylor Hall to New Jersey for Adam Larsson
Watch below: On June 29, 2016, Quinn Phillips filed this report after the Edmonton Oilers stunned their fans by trading Taylor Hall, its former first overall draft pick, to the New Jersey Devils for Adam Larsson, a badly-needed defenceman.
Oscar Klefbom, Larsson's defensive partner, echoed his coach's sentiment.
‚ÄúHe's been so good for us all year, playing a physical game,‚Äù Klefbom said of Larsson.
‚ÄúThis kind of games, he loves to be on the ice. For me as a player, (I) can just focus on my game and you know he's going to take care of his business.‚Äù
At times, Larsson and Klefbom have drawn the challenge of covering San Jose captain Joe Pavelski, the Sharks' top-scoring forward in the regular season with 29 goals and 68 points. Pavelski set up Melker Karlsson for the overtime goal in Game 1, but has been limited to only three shots on net the past two games.
READ MORE: Oilers head coach expects Oscar Klefbom to be back for Game 3
‚ÄúHe puts himself in a spot where it's really hard to defend because you really need to pay attention to where his stick is at,‚Äù Klefbom said of Pavelski, known for his net-front tips. ‚ÄúYou can move his body around a little bit, but as soon as the shot comes he's there.‚Äù
The return of centre Joe Thornton to the Sharks lineup in Game 3 should not change Edmonton's basic defensive approach, Klefbom added.
‚ÄúOn the ice you can see how he buys time for everyone around him,‚Äù Klefbom said. ‚ÄúIt's very impressive to see, but if we just focus on our game and take care, we should be fine.‚Äù
PORTLAND, Maine (AP) ‚Äî The second Zumwalt-class stealth destroyer has passed its sea test.
A statement from Naval Sea Systems Command says the future USS Michael Monsoor successfully completed its acceptance trials Thursday.
The Portland Press Herald reports the statement says onboard systems such as navigation, damage control, mechanical, combat, communication and propulsion met or exceeded specifications.
The 610-foot-long Monsoor headed out to sea for the first time in December. Its first sea trials were cut short because of equipment failures.
The Monsoor is the second built at Maine's Bath Iron Works in a class of three futuristic-looking ships that feature electric-drive propulsion, new radar and sonar, powerful guns and missiles and a stealthy shape.
The cost of the three Zumwalt-class destroyers is estimated at $22 billion, the most expensive Navy destroyers ever built.

Facing severe criticism over the implementation of Goods and Services Tax, the government on Friday announced a slew of measures to ease the concerns of traders, exporters and small business while slashing the rates on 27 items of common consumption, including roti, khakhra, namkeens, stationery, man-made yarn ‚Äî with most of them brought to 5% category.The tax rate on services, including government contracts involving large labour, job work services in relation to imitation jewellery, some food and food products has been reduced from 12 percent to 5 percent.However, in the midst of all this, the thin cracker snack - khakhra, popular in Gujarat, became the centre of the discussion with many criticising Jaitely's move while others simply stuck to cracking jokes around it.
Two economic partners with growing trade volume, Turkey and the European Union (EU) are expected to benefit from the expanding bilateral trade in the upcoming period with strong economic growth data in the eurozone and Turkey.
After the Eurozone achieved the fastest growth rate of the past decade in 2017, there is an increased expectation that the demand rise in Europe will support Turkey's exports. Economic growth in the eurozone reached the highest in a decade, at 2.5 percent last year.
The rising economic momentum has also boosted expectations that Europe's demand for goods and services from Turkey will increase in the upcoming period.
Angel Talavera, the Lead Economist at London-based Oxford Economics, stated that Turkey will be one of the countries that will benefit the most from Europe's economic growth, stressing that it is certainly good news for Turkey that the European economy has started to rise again. Talavera continued, "This will provide considerable support to Turkey's exports. The external environment will continue to be extremely positive for Turkey this year as it was last year."
Stressing that the Eurozone's 2.5 percent growth is above the region's potential growth, Talavera noted that a sustainable growth of nearly 2 percent in the Eurozone is expected in the upcoming period. "According to what we have now, we are in the middle of the economic cycle in the Eurozone. We are optimistic that economic growth can continue for a few more years," he added.
In 2017, more than half of Turkish exports, which totaled to $157.1 billion, went to the 28 EU countries and the union has received Turkish goods worth $73.94 billion, according to the data provided by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat). As much as the EU is a perfect destination for Turkish goods, Turkey is also an indispensable market for EU exports as the country ranks among the top five destinations for EU goods. Last year, the value of exports from 28 EU countries to Turkey amounted to $85.2 billion dollars.
The main risks for the Eurozone continue to be political
Talavera said that the strong economic growth trend in the Eurozone could boost the speed of implementing economic reforms in the region and strengthen the region's resistance to possible shocks.
Referring to possible future risks in the Eurozone, Talavera stated that the main risks for the Eurozone remain political, with the most important risks being the results of the elections in Italy and the possibility of the U.K.'s secession from the EU without an agreement (a harsh Brexit scenario.)
Growth in region countries this year will occur on a broad basis
A report released by the international credit rating agency Moody's last month showed that economic recovery in the Eurozone supports the 2018 outlook despite the irregular structural reform program.
The report revealed that the economic growth of the Eurozone will be 2 percent on average this year, continuing, "The domestic demand supports the upside potential of growth in Germany, France, Spain and Italy. When we look in general, even though growth remains relatively light compared to the
pre-crisis period in the Eurozone countries, the region is experiencing a productive cycle of rising employment, strong household spending and growing investments. Growth in the region's countries this year will be broad-based with all demand components."

We weren't big fans of the Sam Smith track that served as the sonic backbone of 2015's James Bond flick Spectre, especially after hearing the song Radiohead composed that was ultimately turned down by the film's producers. Aptly titled ‚ÄúSpectre‚Äù, Radiohead eventually shared the track for public enjoyment, though they've yet to play it live as a full band.
However, as Stereogum points out, the song served as the second encore to Thom Yorke's solo set last night in Milan. Played solo with piano, Yorke's rendition eschews the song's cinematic strings, resulting in something infinitely more harrowing. Check out some fan-shot footage of Yorke's ‚ÄúSpectre‚Äù below.
The ‚ÄúSpectre‚Äù debut comes on the heels of Yorke premiering a brand-new solo song, ‚ÄúAxe‚Äù, in Florence on Monday night. He plays Zurich tonight, then will play nine more shows throughout the month of June. Lord knows what other surprises he might have in store. All this new music ‚Äî ‚ÄúI Am A Very Rude Person‚Äù and ‚ÄúSaturdays‚Äù debuted back in December ‚Äî bodes well for Yorke's follow-up to 2014's solo effort Tomorrow's Modern Boxes. In the meantime, he's also prepping his film scoring debut with Luca Guadagnino's Suspiria remake.
Five years after Colorado voters approved a measure to legalize marijuana, Gov. John Hickenlooper warned California officials Tuesday that they face challenges now that voters have approved recreational use in the Golden State.
Legalization requires urgent attention to multiple public health issues that include preventing impaired driving and making sure edible pot products are not made to be attractive to minors, Hickenlooper told California lawmakers Tuesday at a legislative hearing at the Capitol.
California voters followed Colorado's lead in November by approving Proposition 64, which allows the sale of marijuana for recreational use.
‚ÄúWe made an awful lot of mistakes as we were trying to wrestle with some of these issues,‚Äù Hickenlooper told the California legislators.
Hickenlooper was elected after Colorado approved legalization and initially opposed it, but has since come around to believe a regulatory system can work.
It took Colorado officials a year to reach an agreement to set a standard for what constitutes impaired driving, the governor said. The standard is met if a blood test finds 5 nanograms of THC per milliliter of blood, but the governor warned that it may be difficult for Californians to agree on a standard because people may argue that a particular level is too high or too low.
‚ÄúWe think 5 nanograms is the right number,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe went through a lot of testing.‚Äù
Proposition 64 does not set a standard, and California's police chiefs have called on the Legislature to adopt a 5-nanograms standard, but marijuana activists say the measurement is not a good way of determining impaired driving.
Hickenlooper also said that Colorado initially did not require proper labeling of edibles, so brownies containing up to eight doses of THC were being sold without the consumer knowing the levels. He also said some edibles were made to look like popular candies, but that the state has since adopted labeling and marketing rules.
California lawmakers asked Hickenlooper about the election of President Trump and whether that has led to more federal enforcement, given that marijuana remains an illegal drug according to federal law.
Hickenlooper said there has been some federal enforcement against illegal growers and gangs, but he thinks Trump will not order a crackdown in states where it has been legalized.
‚ÄúWe're optimistic that he is going to let the experiment continue,‚Äù the governor said.
One of the most difficult challenges for California will be to put a system of regulations, taxes and licensing in place by a Jan. 1, 2018, deadline. Colorado also had a year to put something in place.
‚ÄòIt's one of the hardest things we have ever done,‚Äù Hickenlooper said.
The governor's comments were helpful to California's work to put a regulatory system in place, said Sen. Mike McGuire (D-San Rafael), chairman of the Senate Governance and Finance Committee, which held the hearing.
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) ‚Äì The U.S. News & World Report has awarded a five-star rating to the Mary Free Bed's Sub-Acute Rehabilitation program, earning the facility a spot on the list of 2017-2018 ‚ÄúBest Nursing Homes.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe rating is a reflection of patient rehabilitation outcomes and the way we deliver care,‚Äù said Leslie Shanlian, administrator of the Mary Free Bed Sub-Acute Rehabilitation program. ‚ÄúOnly 28 percent of Michigan's 444 skilled nursing facilities attained a five-star rating. The average in Michigan is 3.4. We're delighted with this news.‚Äù
Of the more than 15,000 nursing homes analyzed by U.S. News, only a percentage qualified as ‚Äúbest nursing home.‚Äù The report uses the rankings to help people make informed decisions concerning health care.
This is not the first national rating for the Mary Free Bed Sub-Acute Rehabilitation program. Earlier this year, it was also awarded a five-star rating from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), based on on health inspections, staffing and quality of medical care.
West Michigan had a total of five nursing homes named as top-performers.
Partnering with Trinity Health Senior Communities, the Mary Free Bed Sub-Acute Rehabilitation program provides short-term inpatient rehabilitation to patients recovering from an injury, surgery or illnesses including:
Multiple injuries, including complex fractures
Stroke
Amputation
Cancer
Heart attacks and cardiac surgery
General weakness or deconditioning after illness or surgery
Orthopedic surgeries, such as laminectomy/fusion, hip and joint replacement, and hip fracture repair.

LONDON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Cardiff City continued their impressive start to the English Championship season, beating Aston Villa 3-0 with two goals from new winger Nathaniel Mendez-Laing and one by Junior Hoilett.
Neil Warnock's side are among four teams who have won both of ther opening games, sitting top of the table ahead of Wolverhampton Wanderers, Nottingham Forest and Ipswich Town.
Villa were one of the pre-season favourites for the title after signing Chelsea's former England captain John Terry but, after drawing their opener, they disappointed 5,000 travelling fans with a lacklustre display that upset manager Steve Bruce.
Forest's Greek midfielder Andreas Bouchalakis, who joined from Olympiakos Piraeus last month, scored two fine goals on his league debut as Mark Warburton's side won a seven-goal thriller to give the manager a happy return to his former club Brentford.
Goals from new signing Barry Douglas and Ivan Cavaleiro gave Wolves an excellent 2-0 win at Derby County while Ipswich came from behind to beat Barnsley 2-1 away.
Former Russia manager Leonid Slutsky achieved his first league win in England as Abel Hernandez scored a hat-trick in Hull City's 4-1 home win over Burton Albion.
Fulham recovered from the first-minute dismissal of Tomas Kalas to draw 1-1 at Reading after Lucas Piazon scored against his former club who led through Liam Kelly's strike.
In the late game, Garry Monk's Middlesbrough secured their first points of the season with a 1-0 win at home to promoted Sheffield United. (Reporting by Neil Robinson; editing by Ken Ferris)
Minister of Civic Education, Culture and Community Development Grace Chiumia has disclosed that some members of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have planned to end her political career following her sentiments against the electoral reform bills.
Chiumia said this over the weekend adding that there are deep divisions within the governing DPP and that she is one of the targeted politicians to be pulled down.
According to her, all is not well in the ruling DPP especially at this time when the party is nearly to hold a national convention.
While failing to mention the name of the suspects, Chiumia said ‚ÄúI know the people who are fighting me. I feel sorry that instead of us strengthening the party in readiness for 2019 polls there is internal fight. They are taking advantage of what I said recently in Mzimba concern the electoral reform bills.‚Äù
During the rally she held at Mpherembe in Mzimba West Constituency last week, Chiumia said President Peter Mutharika's administration is not in support of the proposed electoral reforms, especially the proposal to have 50 percent-plus-one majority in the presidential election.
Chiumia said apart from that, Malawi is not ready for change in elections management, as it will be a waste of resources.
She then accused members of the clergy for being confusionists especially for pressurizing Parliamentarians to pass the bills.
Ironically, two other Cabinet ministers who attended the rally‚Äî Jappie Mhango (Transport and Public Works) and Goodall Gondwe (Finance, Economic Planning and Development)‚Äîdid not comment on Chiume's remarks in their addresses to the meeting.
Later after the media carried the story Chiumia said Malawians misinterpreted her remarks.
‚ÄúWhat I meant is, it is my responsibility to outline the disadvantages of such reforms so that Malawians can properly make a decision after comparing the advantages which PAC and other stakeholders are advocating,‚Äù she said.
Chiumia said she has written PAC to clarify her remarks, saying her ministry ‚Äòs mandate is to civic educate the people.
PAC has organised nationwide marches on December 13 2017 to demonstrate dissatisfaction with how government has handled electoral and local government reforms.
The Electoral Reforms Bills include an amendment of Section 80(2) of the Constitution and Section 96 (5) of the Presidential and Parliamentary Elections Act proposing 50 percent+1 percent majority in presidential election and an amendment of Section 81 (3) of the Constitution for swearing-in of the President and Vice-President to be done after 30 days.
Proposals to have the reforms date back to 2004 and the subsequent Constitutional Review Conference in 2007.

GREENVILLE ‚Äî The Piqua football team wasted no time putting last week's loss to Sidney behind them and evening its record in GWOC North play Friday night at Harman Field.
The Indians exploded for 28 points in the first quarter and never looked back in a 42-7 romp over Greenville.
Piqua improved to 4-3 overall and 1-1 in the GWOC North, while Greenville dropped to 2-5 and 0-2.
‚ÄúI think so,‚Äù Piqua football coach Bill Nees said about taking some frustrations out on Greenville. ‚ÄúThe kids were focused and were sharp with everything.‚Äù
Piqua took the opening kickoff and went 55 yards in three plays in a half where they only ran the ball three times.
Austin Davis opened the game with a 14-yard pass to Colin Roe ‚Äî after Mick Karn recovered a short kick at the Piqua 45.
Then Davis hooked up with Hayden Schrubb ‚Äî who would catch five passes for 133 yards ‚Äî on consecutive plays for 25 yards and 21-yard TD.
On a two-point pass on the PAT, Ben Schmiesing appeared to catch the ball, but the officials ruled otherwise, leaving the score at 6-0 just 1:05 into the game.
Greenville was moving the ball on the ground on its opening drive ‚Äî until Schmiesing stepped in front of a Wave pass attempt and returned it 59 yards to the Greenville 5-yard line.
After a holding penalty, Davis threw an 18-yard TD pass to Cale Meckstroth and Robbie Comstock's kick made it 13-0.
After some great kick coverage, Piqua forced Greenville to punt from deep in its own territory.
‚ÄúI thought our kick coverage was exceptional,‚Äù Nees said. ‚ÄúSam Herndon had six solo tackles and I don't think that is something that happens a whole lot.‚Äù
On a first-and-15 from the Greenville 46, Davis hooked up with Schrubb again for a 46-yard TD pass and Comstock's kick made it 20-0.
After Greenville was pinned back after the kickoff again, the punter bobbled the ball, them missed it when he tried to kick it ‚Äî with Piqua's Matt Blankenship recovering at the 6-yard line.
On another one-play drive, Schmiesing ran it in from six yards out and Karn threw to Jacob Bushnell for the two-point PAT to make it 28-0 still in the first quarter.
In the second quarter, there was any scoring until Piqua's Makeegan Kuhn stepped in front of a pass at the Piqua 33-yard line and took it 67 yards for a pick-six. Comstock's kick made it 35-0 at the half.
The Piqua defense had a stop to open the second half, but on a fumbled exchange in the shotgun, Greenville's Tony Sells picked it up and ran 45 yards to the Piqua 2-yard line.
Micah Light ran it in on the next play and Ethan Flanery's kick made it 35-7.
But, Piqua came right back down the field on four completions by Davis. The last was a 7-yard TD pass to Devon Brown and Comstock's kick made it 42-7.
That brought and end to the night for the Piqua starters and neither team scored again.
‚ÄúThis game couldn't have gone any better,‚Äù Nees said. ‚ÄúWe were able to keep everybody fresh. That is big with a short week and a big game with Butler to get ready for on Thursday night.‚Äù
Davis finished the night 12-for-14 for 219 yards and four TDs.
The Indians will host Vandalia-Butler in a Thursday Night Lights game at 7 p.m. at Alexander Stadium/Purk Field.
After doing exactly what they needed to do Friday night.

Retail Therapy‚Ä¶we all know what that means. When the stress goes up, the tough go shopping. But, sadly the options of brick and mortar stores are decreasing. On April 10, the IBD Weekly (Investors Business Daily) headline caught my eye: The Death of Retail. This was an assessment of the many store closings happening before our eyes. I think everyone expected Sears and Payless Shoes to always be around, but, the times, they are changing. It seems the experts all attribute the changes to the growth of online shopping. However, I wonder if anyone is really listening to the customers.
Days after this article appeared, women went online to voice their opinions‚Ä¶.and they had a lot to say. The assumption is women prefer online shopping now, but that is an assumption and really far from the truth. Here is a summation of comments made by the shoppers:
‚ÄúI am almost 80 and still enjoy shopping. The lack of customer service however is appalling. A ‚ÄúHello‚Äù from somewhere in the store as you enter does not take the place of good customer service. We will lose an important part of the shopping experience if we lose the brick and mortar stores.
I've been looking for new tops/shirts for spring. Several times I've been to the mall and left discouraged and upset. In all of (certain brand) women's departments there were only two sales people and they were at the purchase kiosk. The woman who I tried to deal with was bored, unhappy and not interested in my purchase at all.
I think when the larger chain stores moved the cash registers out of each department and converted to one main kiosk it started the beginning of their demise. It's like shopping in a warehouse.
If retailers carried their ‚Äòtall' sizes in their brick and mortar shops, I would be there. Alas, those sizes are always online only. Why bother going to a store and trying on clothes that will never fit? I go to the store to return online purchases only.
I do enjoy trying things on in the comfort of my home, which is a perk of online shopping. I do not enjoy packaging things back up to ship off a return, or making a trip to a store just to make a return. I note increasing disparity in sizing even in the same or similar brands. Quality of the clothing is frequently not good. I want good quality, basic colors, and I do not wear athleisure or whatever the new trend is in clothing. I don't see that trend as a good thing. Seriously, one thing that has turned me off on brick and mortar stores is making the trip there, only to learn the sale ended yesterday or isn't on until tomorrow‚Ä¶.all the special promos, the upselling, the trying to sell you a credit card at the checkout. By the time I am home I am exhausted, and usually didn't find what I wanted or needed.
Excellent customer service, face to face contact and stepping away from the screens that invade our lives are extremely important for the Human Condition. I hope it will not be the case of ‚Äúthat we don't know what we've got until its gone‚Äù‚Ä¶..
I have stopped shopping online after one too many bad experiences of buying something that was supposed to be a certain color and arrived in a strange color; or that was called ‚Äúleather‚Äù but upon arrival it was clearly PU; or claimed to be silk but is clearly polyester. Or the wrong shade of a color ‚Äî poor or misleading photography. I am SICK SICK SICK of it, and will never shop online for clothes again, except for specific, known brands that are not being shipped from China.
I don't shop online for clothing very often and only on a website where I know the quality of the clothing because I've been to the brick and mortar store. To me online shopping is like days gone by where we shopped from catalogs because we didn't have the stores close to us. I live in Canada and the shipping from online stores which are mostly US based is ridiculous. It can add as much as $40 to your order. I sure hope we don't come to the place of losing brick and mortar stores. I do agree with the issue of customer service, it's definitely not what it used to be.‚Äù
This is just a sampling of what women had to day. So, San Antonio Women, what is your opinion about shopping online vs. the stores? If you have left the stores, what will it take to get you back?
Just to be clear, I am a fan of the store! I love the whole experience and believe I save time and money by going into a favorite store or boutique. Less time returning items!
Now, it is your turn!

Trollhunters has come to an end with it's third season and while it's certainly hard to say goodbye, fans can rest assured that the Tales of Arcadia are far from over. In fact, they're only just getting started as there are two more installments to come in the popular series. The second installment will be 3 Below and then there are Wizards. While 3 Below is set to premiere in late 2018, many fans are wondering when will Wizards be released?
While there is no official release date yet for Wizards, it is set to premiere some time in 2019. Not much is known about the final installment of the Tales of Arcadia, but Netflix did release the show's synopsis:
DreamWorks Wizards brings together the three disparate worlds of trolls, aliens and wizards who have found themselves drawn to Arcadia. The final chapter of the Tales of Arcadia culminates in an apocalyptic battle for the control of magic that will ultimately determine the fate of these supernatural worlds that have now converged.
During the third season of Trollhunters, Merlin (David Bradley), one of the most iconic wizards, appeared and during an interview with Collider the show's executive producer Marc Guggenheim all but confirmed that Merlin would be back. "I will say that Merlin is a wizard... That's about as much as I can get away with," he said. Thus fans should probably expect to see some familiar faces in Wizards.
DreamWorksTV on YouTube
However, before the Tales of Arcadia comes to an end with Wizards, fans will first get to enjoy 3 Below, which will follow two royal teenage aliens, Aja (Tatiana Maslany) and Krel (Diego Luna), and their bodyguard who flee a surprise takeover of their home planet by an evil dictator and crash land in Arcadia. On the run from intergalactic bounty hunters, they struggle to blend in and adapt to high school while also trying to repair their ship so they can return home and defend their planet. Aja and Krel were introduced in the third season of Trollhunters while they helped Jim and the rest of the Trollhunters fight against the evil Morgana.
In the interview with Collider, Guggenheim noted that 3 Below would be a bit different than Trollhunters. "I think Trollhunters is a classic, Campbellian hero story like The Force Awakens, telling a very tried-and-true story that you've seen the classic structure of," he said. "3 Below is a lot wackier and a much more unconventional show. I'm just as proud of 3 Below as I am of Trollhunters, just for completely different reasons."
Guggenheim also confirmed that there will be characters from Trollhunters in 3 Below, though of course he didn't say who. "If you're a fan of Trollhunters and certain characters, you're going to see them again in 3 Below," he said. "In fact, 3 Below allows relatively minor characters from Trollhunters the opportunity to shine, so we get to revisit those characters." Additionally, Guggenheim also noted that 3 Below is "even more visually impressive than Trollhunters," which is quite impressive since Trollhunters is already stunning.
Thus, there is a lot to look forward to with the next two installments of Tales of Arcadia. Although fans will be leaving the Trollhunters behind, this won't be the last time they're seen, so fans should definitely keep watching to see what's next for everyone in Arcadia. The story has only just begun and there's even more adventure to come. For now though, fans and newcomers can now watch Trollhunters from beginning to end. So whether you've already seen the series or have never watched it before, now's the perfect time to see what all the hype is about.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron pledged on Tuesday to try to resolve U.S.-European differences on Iran but Trump gave no clear signal about whether he would carry out a threat to abandon an international nuclear deal with Tehran.
After lengthy talks at the White House, Macron told a joint news conference with Trump that they had discussed ‚Äúa new deal‚Äù that would strengthen the 2015 accord along the lines Trump wants, such as by addressing Iran's expansion in the Middle East and its ballistic missile program.
But with a deadline on U.S. economic sanctions against Iran looming next month, it was unclear whether the two allies made substantial progress on the future of the nuclear deal, which the West sees as vital to preventing Iran from building a nuclear bomb.
Trump continued his hostile rhetoric toward the nuclear deal, calling it terrible, ridiculous and insane and threatening Iran with repercussions should it restart its nuclear program.
‚ÄúIf Iran threatens us in any way, they will pay a price like few countries have ever paid,‚Äù Trump said.
Trump has until May 12 to decide whether to keep the United States in the agreement and is under strong European pressure to remain in it, with Macron saying that while imperfect it holds the best chance of containing Tehran.
The two leaders also discuss Syria with Macron urging Trump to keep U.S. forces there for the time being as bulwark against Iran and to ensure the defeat of Islamic State militants.
Trump did not promise to leave the troops in Syria but made clear they would not be withdrawn imminently.

‚ÄúWe want to come home. We'll be coming home. But we want to leave a strong and lasting footprint,‚Äù Trump said.
Iran has said it will ramp up its nuclear program if the deal collapses and a senior Iranian official said on Tuesday that Tehran might quit a treaty designed to stop the spread of nuclear weapons if Trump scraps the agreement.
Under the deal, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear ambitions in return for relief from economic sanctions. Tehran says its nuclear program is only for peaceful means.
Trump said he and Macron could have an agreement soon on the Iran deal. ‚ÄúWe could have at least an agreement among ourselves very quickly. I think we're fairly close to understanding each other.‚Äù
Trump called the Iran agreement, struck between Iran and world powers, a ‚Äúterrible deal‚Äù that was ‚Äúinsane‚Äù and ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù because it did not deal with ballistic missiles or Iran's involvement in conflicts such as those in Yemen or Syria.
A U.S. withdrawal from the Iran agreement would raise tensions in an already volatile region, possibly prompting an arms race involving Saudi Arabia. Iran says its nuclear program is aimed only at peaceful purposes.

Pulling out of the Iran agreement would also raise questions over how Trump could coerce North Korea into giving up its nuclear weapons. Trump is trying to arrange a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in late May or early June.
Netflix has cancelled Naomi Watts-starrer drama Gypsy after just a single season.The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that the 10-episode series was scrapped despite its impressive cast and production team.Gypsy told the story of Jean Holloway, a therapist who formed intimate relationships with the people who were close to her patients."We've cancelled very few shows. I'm always pushing the content team. We have to take more risks you have to try more crazy things. Because we should have a higher cancel rate overall," said CEO Reed Hasting.Meanwhile, the streaming giant has renewed Jenji Cohan's GLOW for a second season.
U.S. President Donald Trump needed only 10 months to defeat ISIS in Iraq after years of failure on the part of his predecessor Barack Obama, according to Trump's ally and former chief strategist Steve Bannon.
Speaking at a rally for Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore at a campaign rally in Midland City, Bannon took time to heap praise on Trump's ‚Äúbold‚Äù foreign leadership.

‚ÄúWhat did Iraq do yesterday? They said the war with ISIS was over in Iraq,‚Äù Bannon said. ‚ÄúIn 10 months, [Trump] destroyed the physical caliphate of ISIS.‚Äù
On Saturday, Iraq's prime minister said that a three-year combat mission had resulted in the extremists being driven out from all of their former territories.

Bannon went on to add that as recently as 2014, ISIS had millions of people in enslavement in Iraq and Syria, were actively recruiting terrorists in Europe and had custody of oil wells.
‚ÄúThey were a more robust nation state than Iraq and Syria at the time,‚Äù Bannon claimed.
He insisted that none of the military victories over ISIS in Iraq were down to Obama, even though the crucial assault on Mosul was launched by coalition-backed Iraqi forces in October 2016, when Obama was president.
‚ÄúI don't wanna hear that this was Obama's plan. This was not Obama's plan,‚Äù Bannon said. ‚ÄúGeneral Mattis and President Trump said they were going to physically destroy the caliphate of ISIS.‚Äù

Bannon also hailed Trump for working with countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to help battle terrorism and the threat posed by Iran.
‚ÄúThis is part of the world that's always double dealing ya. They took action, bold action. That's Donald J. Trump's leadership.‚Äù

Thousands remain without electricity across the Deep South days after a winter snow storm snapped power lines across the region.
MGN
At least 18,500 homes and businesses in Georgia were still in the dark Monday according to Georgia Power and Georgia Electric Membership Corporation. Metro Atlanta got several inches of snow Friday and Saturday, while some areas farther north saw up to a foot of snowfall.
Utilities in Louisiana reported at least 1,000 customers were still waiting for power to be restored. Mississippi had about 700 outages and Alabama roughly 500.
Several school systems closed Monday in Georgia because of a lingering threat of icy road conditions.
The unusually heavy December snow storm brought flurries to New Orleans and dumped several inches in Mississippi and Alabama.
New Delhi: Basketball continues to grow in India with each passing day, thanks mainly to the establishment of the NBA academy in the Greater Noida, as well as the presence of the league's basketball schools in cities such as Mumbai, New Delhi and Pune.
Among the NBA's latest endeavours in India happen to be the Basketball Without Borders (BWB) Asia Camp that got flagged off on Wednesday at the NBA Academy, with several noted players from various teams turning up at the camp that saw the participation of 66 selected boys and girls from across the Asia Pacific.
The league's initiatives in India have started to bear fruit already, if the opinion of some of the visiting NBA players is to be taken into consideration. The key takeaway would be the fact that young Indian basketball players are starting to get better at the sport, and that the game is starting to get a lot more acceptance in the cricket-mad nation, if Oklahoma City Thunder player Corey Brewer is to be believed.
"I just feel they've got some talent. Kids are starting to get better. You can tell they're starting to love the game around in here.
"Soccer's the number one sport (sic), so we're trying to get them to play basketball," said Brewer, who added that he came up with an instant "Yes!" when offered a trip to India.
There are few sports in the country that enjoy the fanfare and financial clout as cricket does, the indicators of which would be the salaries and endorsements that the cricketers earn, as well as the success of the Indian Premier League (IPL). When asked about the drawbacks that hinder the growth of the sport in India, Brewer pointed towards the trend of youngsters picking up the game a little late, especially when compared to the basketball culture among American kids.
"Just start playing earlier. Younger age groups. A lot of (Indian) kids don't start playing till they're 14-15, so they're behind. They have to work a lot harder, and they're still behind, because kids in America start playing at an early age.
"So I felt over here, once kids start playing at an earlier age, kids are going to be better," said the Thunder shooting guard, adding that the inclusion of another player from the country in the main league would be NBA's next goal as far as India are concerned.
Would there ever be something as big as an NBA exhibition game in the country though, one featuring some of the biggest names from the two conferences? Brewer didn't entirely rule the idea out.
"That'll be cool! You never know, the way the NBA's going, the way it's growing, and it's going global. India is definitely a destination there, where NBA is concentrating on. So, it could happen."
NBA first made its entry into India by setting up a basketball school in Mumbai in March, 2017, which was followed by the establishment of the Academy two months later in the National Capital Region (NCR).
Like many sporting leagues around the world, the NBA too is keen on going after untapped resources in countries such as India, China, Brazil, among others, in a bid to make the league truly global.
"Africa. Brazil. China, for sure. There are a lot of places. NBA's just trying to go global. They're trying to hit everything, so this is good," said Brewer.
Before starting off with the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2007, and going on to represent teams such as the Dallas Mavericks and Los Angeles Lakers, Brewer sharpened his skills in college sport, representing the Florida Gators (University of Florida).
In a country that finds itself at the top of the Summer Olympics medal table more often than not, college sport plays a central role in shaping future sports stars and enjoys a massive following among its masses, with a number of teams as well as individual sports falling under the aegis of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).
"It's very important just because you get better, you develop (and) you got to learn the game, 'cause once you get to the NBA, you're thrown out there, and you should know a lot of stuff. So when you go to college, they teach you. So when you get to the NBA, you can pick everything up faster," added Brewer.
Brewer joined Oklahoma from LA Lakers in March earlier this year, appearing in a total of 18 games for his new side (including 16 starts). While Oklahoma clinched the fourth seed in the regular season, they went down to Utah Jazz in the first round of the playoffs.
"We got some good players. We got Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony, a lot of good guys. Andre Roberson got hurt, and it kind of really hurt us, but we had a good run. It's tough getting beaten by Utah in the playoffs. But, this summer I face a big summer," added the veteran of more than 700 games.
Like Brook Lopez and Kevin Durant before him, Brewer's itinerary included a trip to the Taj Mahal among others. From the looks of it, the 32-year-old seems to have taken a liking to the people and the food here.
"It's been really good with the Taj Mahal the other day. Just learning about it ‚Äî why it was built and how it was built. That was great. Pretty good food, sure. Spicy, I like spice. And everybody's been real nice. So it's been good. Good trip."
The other active players who will be attending the BWB Asia 2018 event are Caris LeVert (Brooklyn Nets), Kelly Olynyk (Miami Heat), Dwight Powell (Dallas Mavericks) from the NBA as well as two-time champion Ruth Riley (San Antonio Silver Stars) and Ebony Hoffman (Indiana Fever) from the WNBA. Also attending the event are Indian players Satnam Singh and Amjyot Singh, the former being the first Indian to get drafted into the main league when he got picked by the Dallas Mavericks.
Carmelo Anthony and La La Anthony have separated after nearly seven years as husband and wife, according to a report Monday.
The "Power" actress and TV personality moved out of the home she shared with the New York Knicks player and their 10-year-old son, Kiyan, last week, TMZ reported. The split is said to be amicable.
The two got married in July 2010 after a six-year engagement, with LeBron James, Spike Lee, Serena Williams, Ciara, Kim Kardashian, Amar'e Stoudemire, Ludacris and Kelly Rowland reportedly among the guests.
A rep for La La Anthony (n√©e La La V√°zquez) did not respond immediately to a request for confirmation.
With all the talk about aging baby boomers and life-extending health care advances, it might be a bit bewildering deciding which seniors housing assets are best primed for success.
Lee Everett, managing consultant at research firm CoStar Portfolio Strategy, might be able to provide some clarity. Two product types‚Äîactive adult communities and continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs)‚Äîwill be the winners in the seniors housing race both in the short and the long term, Everett says.
Everett and his CoStar colleagues are bullish about active adult communities, which are age-restricted developments that offer an independent lifestyle and relatively maintenance-free housing. Growth in this segment is ‚Äújust around the corner,‚Äù with more baby boomers getting older and seeking alternatives to traditional homes and apartments.
‚ÄúWe're looking at a period where there's going to be a lot of fast and explosive growth in active adult communities,‚Äù Everett says.
The amount of growth in active living communities will depend on how the projects are developed, says seniors housing consultant Andrew Carle, an adjunct professor at George Mason University. For instance, baby boomers aren't inclined to live in a community anchored by a golf course. They do, however, feel comfortable in community settings, since many of them attended big high schools and colleges, and have worked at big corporations, Carle says.
‚ÄúWhat we know about baby boomers‚Äîand I'm one, by the way‚Äîis we actually will congregate. We've never been alone; we're probably the most social demographic in history,‚Äù Carle says.
One company capitalizing on that social aspect is apartment developer and manager Greystar.
Greystar's Overture brand specializes in resort-style apartment communities for residents 55 and over. In the Austin, Texas, market, for instance, Greystar is rolling out three Overture properties. The amenities include a spa, library, game room, theater, yoga studio, fitness center and full-service salon. Activities include cooking demonstrations, tai chi sessions, wine tours and educational workshops.
‚ÄúWe found that active adults over 55 years old are looking to downsize, but also retain a peer community,‚Äù Joanne Broadway, managing director of real estate for Greystar, told the Zillow residential real estate website. ‚ÄúTheir desire to connect and socialize is driving their decision for a new apartment home, which ultimately is based on choice versus needs.‚Äù
As for CCRCs, also known as ‚Äúlife plan‚Äù communities, Everett and others at CoStar expect less explosive growth. By definition, CCRCs feature a continuum of care, including independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing. Everett anticipates a continuing consolidation of those functions, which today are often housed in stand-alone facilities, into CCRCs.
CCRCs represent a longer-term play in seniors housing, he notes. These communities will ‚Äúbecome more en vogue as the senior population continues to age over the next 20, 25, 30 years.‚Äù
Andrew Nesi, executive vice president and a member of the seniors living finance team at HJ Sims, an underwriter of tax-exempt bonds, says he and his colleagues have a ‚Äúvery positive‚Äù outlook for CCRCs. Among the biggest developers of CCRCs are Greenbrier, Greystone and Life Care Services; non-profits operate about 80 percent of these communities.
‚ÄúWe think the market is mature. We think that it's well-received by the investment community. We think as an asset class it has performed better than other real estate asset classes through the recession,‚Äù Nesi says.
CCRCs are a ‚Äúwonderful model‚Äù in seniors housing because of the high retention rate of residents as they move from one care level to the next, says Joshua Jandris, senior managing director of investments for the national seniors housing group at brokerage firm Marcus & Millichap.
As an alternative to CCRCs, Jandris anticipates new independent living properties popping up over the next five to 10 years, as a lot of the current facilities date back two decades or more.
In the second quarter of this year, the occupancy level at CCRCs was 90.9 percent, according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care (NIC).
Occupants of CCRCs need to have deep pockets, however. Under the ‚Äúentrance fee‚Äù model, the average amount that had to be paid upfront in the second quarter of this year was $320,000, NIC data shows. Meanwhile, the average second-quarter rent for the independent living portion of CCRCs was $3,266 a month.
For developers, two of the drawbacks to CCRCs are the amount of development capital required‚Äî$5 million to $10 million or more‚Äîand the typical five- to seven-year path from concept to construction, Nesi says.
However, not all activity in the CCRC market revolves around brand-new properties. Many existing CCRCs were built decades ago, experts say, and some of those properties are now being updated or expanded to compete with modern facilities.
Another wrinkle in the CCRC market is that while a lot of existing properties were built in far-flung suburbs, newer properties are going up in inner-ring suburbs or around urban cores, Everett says. That's because seniors don't want to be ‚Äúseparated from the rest of the world.‚Äù Instead, they want access to city-style amenities and a generational mix of residents, says Carle, the senior housing consultant.
One of the most appealing types of CCRC‚Äîbut an extremely complicated one to execute‚Äîis what's called a university-based retirement community (UBRC), Carle notes. Generally speaking, UBRCs are school-affiliated communities that sit on school-owned land or near a university campus. These properties target university alumni as residents.
If you're a developer who's got the patience to tangle with a university bureaucracy and enough money to plunk down on the project, you can pull off a UBRC that ‚Äúwill be the single first choice in that market for the next 50 years,‚Äù Carle says. ‚ÄúAnd everybody else will be fighting for second place.‚Äù
Another take on CCRCs that is also gaining ground involves the mini-CCRC, according to Jandris. Some developers are building stand-alone independent living centers on the same campuses as stand-alone assisted living/memory care combos, but are subtracting the skilled nursing component. While acknowledging that skilled nursing is a ‚Äúwild card‚Äù for CCRCs, given the trickiness in executing that component, Lisa McCracken, senior vice president of seniors living research and development at investment bank Ziegler, says the CCRC overall is ‚Äúa very solid, strong product.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe don't see the [CCRC] model as dead. It's lasted for many years, and ‚Ä¶ it's a very popular model among a certain segment of older adults,‚Äù McCracken notes.
The European Union (EU) on Friday gave thumbs up to India's Goods and Services Tax (GST) saying the new tax regime would facilitate ease of doing business.Visiting EU leaders also welcomed India's efforts to promote economic and social development and expressed interest in participating in initiatives such as 'Make in India' 'Digital India', 'Skill India', and 'Start-Up India'."The EU closely follows Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi's economic reforms, including the historic introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), which can facilitate ease of doing business and promotes market integration in India by realising a simple, efficient and nation-wide indirect tax system," a said India EU Joint Statement issued during India- EU Summit.The 14th annual summit between India and the European Union (EU) was held here. India was represented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The EU was represented by Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, and Jean Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission.Modi appreciated the ongoing participation by EU companies in the flagship initiatives and called for their deeper engagement in India's developmental priorities.The statement further said that the EU side encouraged the greater participation of Indian business organisations into the Enterprise Europe Network."The leaders noted the progress made on EU-India cooperation on resource efficiency and circular economy. Both sides agreed to enhanced cooperation and exchange of experience and best practices in the field of Intellectual Property rights (IPR) and public procurement," it said.The leaders expressed their shared commitment to strengthening the Economic Partnership between India and the EU and noted the ongoing efforts of both sides to re-engage actively towards timely relaunching negotiations for a comprehensive and mutually beneficial India-EU Broad Based Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA).With regard to import tolerance level of tricyclazole in rice the relevant plant protection companies will be invited to present new scientific data in order for the European Food Safety Authority to carry out an additional risk assessment without delay, the statement said.On this basis, the European Commission would expeditiously consider whether to review the above mentioned Regulation.Both the sides also supported early institutionalisation of cooperation between the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to focus on exchange of knowledge and expertise in the area of methodologies for data collection, risk assessment and risk communication.Leaders welcomed the establishment of an Investment Facilitation Mechanism (IFM) for EU investments in India as a means to improve the business climate and hoped that the IFM will ease sharing of best practices and innovative technology from the EU to India."Leaders acknowledged that the 'Make in India' initiative may offer investment opportunities for companies based in the EU Member States," it said.Further, the two sides reiterated the importance of reconciling economic growth and environment protection."They highlighted the importance of moving towards a more circular economic model that reduces primary resource consumption and enhanced the use of secondary raw materials," the statement added.Leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to work together with all Members of the WTO to make the eleventh WTO Ministerial Conference a success with concrete results.

In the downtown shelter, in the midst of a brutal winter, a lot of the men here have reason to cheer for the scrappy team from Philadelphia with a starting quarterback who was nearly rejected by the sport, says Andre, 44, a temporary resident and volunteer. ‚ÄúA lot of guys here share that context,‚Äù said Andre, part of the Good Shepherd's Drug and Alcohol Recovery Enrichment (DARE) Program. (He asked that his last name not be used.) ‚ÄúThese are guys who are living on the street or guys who are working hard to get back to life. That piece of it resonates with them,‚Äù he said. The Sunday night football party is a repeat of last year's inaugural event, when 80 men gathered in the Good Shepherd dining room, with a large screen TV rental and dinner donated by Pizza Pizza.

‚ÄúIt really lifted their spirits,‚Äù said Brother Tim Liss, Good Shepherd's director. ‚ÄúFor about a week after, they seemed more content.‚Äù It's a lonely life, but the Super Bowl party helped, Liss said, by connecting people through sport. ‚ÄúWhen the game is on you get the guys cheering for their favourite team and bantering back and forth. And then they get into the statistics and analysis of the players. The interaction is much, much greater.‚Äù The DARE program has 25 men, while another 70 or so are homeless, staying in the shelter, which is almost always full, Liss said.
As has been widely expected, the Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, to a range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent, Reuters reports. This marked the second time the Fed has raised interest rates this year. But the move is unlikely to change conditions in the commercial real estate sector, according to industry insiders.
The latest interest rate hike ‚Äúrepresents another important step in normalizing monetary policy,‚Äù says Lisa Pendergast, executive director of the CRE Finance Council, an industry trade association. Pendergast warns that aggressive rate hiking going forward could lead to curtailed debt availability in the property markets, but with the economy growing slowly, the Fed seems to continue to exercise the necessary caution.
The last three rate increases had minimal effect on cap rates, according to Barbara Byrne Denham, senior economist with research firm Reis Inc. ‚ÄúWe don't foresee this having any significant impact on cap rates, and we believe the market expected it. It's the 10-year T-bond rate that matters and that hasn't moved much since November.‚Äù
The increase came as no surprise to real estate investors, notes Ernie Katai, executive vice president and head of production with mortgage banking firm Berkadia, bringing down the risk of disruption to the market. Debt capital continues to be widely available. ‚ÄúThe markets have been preparing for a significant period of time that rates would be increasing once real economic growth was evident,‚Äù he says.
Fed officials indicated that they will stick to a previously announced target of a 1.4 percent federal funds rate by the end of 2017, CNBC reports.
Recently, there have been concerns that softer inflation might force the Fed to slow down the pace of planned interest rate increases. According to Fortune, ‚Äúa retreat in inflation over the past two months has caused jitters among some Fed officials who fear that the shortfall, if sustained, could alter the pace of future rate hikes. Earlier on Wednesday, the Labor Department reported consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May, the second drop in three months.‚Äù
Fed Chair Janet Yellen insisted recent inflation patterns were due to temporary factors, including reduced prices on products such as wireless services, rather than structural issues with the economy, the Wall Street Journal reports. She therefore expects rate increases to proceed as expected this year.

The Nashville Predators won their first-round series in six games. They will face the wily Winnipeg Jets in the second-round in what promises to be a well-watched series. Preds fans, many of whom live in a non-traditional hockey market, have been lauded for taking to the game and they nearly broke the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd at an indoor sporting event. But, let's be honest. The Preds chants are boring, uninspired, and don't represent Nashville, known as Music City.
Hear me out.
Nashville Predators are Contenders
Let's get a few things straight. The Predators are legitimate contenders. They are exciting to watch and have depth where it counts. Full disclosure: they are my prediction to win the 2018 Stanley Cup. It is exciting to see hockey do so well in Nashville and fans get amped up about the team and the sport.
Preds fans have revived the odd hockey tradition of throwing sea life; in Nashville, they toss catfish onto the ice. They also have another tradition. It's loud and it's relentless. Preds fans love to heckle the opposing team ‚Äì en masse. There are a number of chants that have gained some notoriety including:
‚ÄúHe shoots, he scores, you suck!‚Äù
‚ÄúIt's all your fault! It's all your fault!‚Äù
‚ÄúWe're gonna beat the hell outta of you, you, you.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe sucks! He sucks, too!‚Äù
The chant you will hear most often, however, occurs after the Preds score a goal. If you don't know it, here is an example. When the Preds played the Pens last year, it went like this:
‚ÄúMurray, Murray, Murray. You Suck‚Ä¶It's all your fault! It's all your fault!‚Äù
Breaking Down the Chant Chants are fun. Getting folks together in a communal celebration of your team is great. Can we agree though, that some chants are better than others? Let's break it down. ‚ÄúHe shoots, he scores, you suck!‚Äù If a goal was scored, a player definitely shot and definitely scored. We are all good there. The problem is, I am not convinced it was because the goalie ‚Äúsucked.‚Äù Matt Murray who beat the Predators last year to win the Stanley Cup didn't and doesn't suck. Letting in one goal doesn't say much. Bad goalies have good nights, and good goalies have bad nights. No goalie who is playing in the NHL sucks. Even this Beer League goalie rose to the challenge. ‚ÄúIt's all your fault! It's all your fault!‚Äù Again, mercilessly heckling the opposing team like 17,000 schoolyard bullies IS fun, I guess. The problem is the basic accuracy of this chant. Very few goals scored in the NHL and especially in the NHL playoffs are the goalie's ‚Äúfault.‚Äù Goals are scored off screens that block the goalie's view or deflections and tips that change the direction of the puck at the last minute. Goals get behind the netminder after they bounce in off defensemen or are scored off rushes in which a goalie's teammates let them down. Is a breakaway goal, which is the result of poor defensive play in the neutral zone, the goalie's fault?
Sure, some goals are the goalie's fault. The problem is that this chant happens either way. It's fake news.
Music City Deserves Better
Nashville is built on music and is a common thread connecting the life and soul of the city to its people. Music has been described as a fundamental pattern in its ‚Äú‚Ä¶cultural, business and social fabric.‚Äù From fiddle tunes and buck dancing in the 1700s to the Fisk Jubilee Singers in the 1800s, music has a long history in Nashville. In 1925, the establishment of radio station WSM and its launch of the broadcast that would be called the Grand Ole Opry secured Nashville's reputation as a creative, music-filled city.
Live music can be seen and heard every day and night of the week in Nashville. The world-famous honky tonks on Broadway offer free live music 365 days a year. Last year, P.K. Subban had fun singing some Johnny Cash at the famed Tootsie's Orchid Lounge. In Nashville, music is written, recorded and performed every single day. Music city deserves better than pathetic chants, whether they are shouted in unison or not.
Three Better Options
Steal from Your Opponent
While not technically a chant, one idea is to steal the Super Mario mushroom sound effect. As some fans know, after the Colorado Avalanche successfully kill a penalty, that is what you hear at the Pepsi Center. It's a great idea. What better way to mock the team you beat in the first round than to steal their sound effects?
Ok I see you Colorado @Avalanche with the Super Mario Mushroom sound effect after a penalty kill. Well played. pic.twitter.com/BmN6G1zk6a ‚Äî Tim Williams (@realtimwilliams) December 19, 2017
Get Creative
Fans need more than sound effects though. Here's one idea: get creative. Game of Thrones will finish its run next year as the biggest and most popular show in the world. An average of more than 23 million Americans watched each episode last season. In one memorable scene in Season 5, Queen Cersei is forced to complete a walk of atonement. Stripped of her clothing, she is made to walk from the Great Sept of Baelor to the Red Keep, escorted by members of the Faith Militant. As she walks, Septa Unella accompanies her, repeatedly crying out ‚ÄúShame!‚Äù and ringing a bell to attract people's attention.
Preds fans should adopt this when their team draws a penalty. Imagine it, as the opposing team's player makes his way to the penalty box, 17, 000 fans yell ‚Äúshame, shame, shame‚Äù in unison. Short, sweet, and mean. It is a crossover chant that has already been used for other purposes. Get on it, Preds fans.
Look At History
Finally, instead of being negative with the ‚Äúyou suck‚Äù stuff, it would be great to see Preds fans get happy. What better way to honor music city than to engage in a song when the home team scores? What should they sing? When in doubt, look to your history, Nashville. What if you used all that fan energy toward celebrating your state. Lots of tunes could be used, but Rocky Top is a great tune and my pick for the Preds' postseason. Recorded first by the Osborne Brother, it has been covered by the Everly Brothers, Lynn Anderson, and even Phish. Yes, Vermont jam band Phish.
Preds fans can and should do better as they cheer their team during what many hopes is a deep playoff run. As great a story as hockey in Nashville has been these last couple of years, fans need to step up their chant game. Here's the chorus to Rocky Top. It should be played and sung loudly and proudly when the Preds score.
Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee

Actress Kriti Sanon loves driving cars, but says that she can tell from her personal experience that it's a bad idea for girls to have their father's company on their first drive.On the sidelines of the showcase of German luxury car manufacturer Audi's A5 trio here on Friday, Kriti told about her experiences behind the wheel.Born and brought up in Delhi, Kriti learnt how to drive during her college days.Recounting her first memory of driving, she said: "It was college first year. I had got my learner's license and that was the first day I was driving a car. It was exciting for me because before that I only tried my hand at cars of the motor school during my driving classes."My dad was sitting next to me and he was anxious from the beginning. I had to take a U-turn and because of the steering issue, my dad panicked and I panicked even more, and I banged the car into the divider. I think girls shouldn't take their dads on their first ever drive."She burst into laughter and added: "I want to mention that post that accident, I never met with any accident, touchwood."Being a tall girl, Kriti enjoys the comfort and space that a SUV provides. She currently has an Audi Q7, but says she rarely gets to be in the driver's seat."I needed a driver and a new car because after Heropanti, I started attending red carpet events and award functions where I was wearing designer clothes, and driving the car wearing those dresses, or stepping out of the car at the red carpets, appeared difficult."
Crews are on scene in Davenport for a water main break off of Brady Street just before Central Park. All four lanes are covered in a water/slush mix and this could cause slick conditions for drivers.
Iowa American Water does have a crew on scene and officials say it typically takes four to six hours to fix the break.
Customers in the area should not notice a change, however, they may experience lower water pressure.
One of the things that makes sports so great is the fact there are so many things fans can debate about. Whether it's debating who is the best hockey player of all time, whether a referee blew a call or who should be starting in net the next day, there are endless topics to discuss with friends or keyboard warriors.
However, one thing that cannot be debated is the fact that Ottawa Senators defenseman, Erik Karlsson, is not only one of the best NHL defensemen today but is one of the best of his generation. In today's NHL, despite an uptick in scoring, it's still hard to find many forwards that can score more than 60 points in a season. Yet Karlsson, despite playing defense, has averaged 67 for his career. That sort of production has him in rarefied air with the likes of Al MacInnis, Brian Leetch and Phil Housley.
If Karlsson were to produce 67 points in 2018-19, he would be crashing the record books and be one of the 40 most prolific defensive scorers in NHL history at just 28 years old.
This is why it's confounding that the Senators seem content to trade him and why rumors are circulating as to where he will go. One of his projected destinations is the New York Rangers, and as TSN's Bob Mckenzie noted, ‚ÄúNew York is New York and the Rangers are the Rangers.‚Äù
Despite what many perceive to be a rebuild, the Rangers cannot help but consider the idea of Karlsson in a Broadway blue shirt. And why not? Prolific scorers on the blue line do not grow on trees. On the surface, this seems like a no-brainer. But here is why Karlsson coming to New York would be a terrible idea.
The Rangers Already Have Their Erik Karlsson
His name is Kevin Shattenkirk, who the Rangers just finished signing for four years at $6.65 million per year in 2017. He took, what even he admits to, a hometown discount to join the team he rooted for as a child. While no one will confuse Shattenkirk's production to Karlsson's, he is no slouch in the scoring department with five seasons of scoring over 40 points.
In order to acquire Karlsson, the Rangers would almost certainly have to trade Shattenkirk or risk having little to no money to address several gaping holes on offense. Trading someone, who came to your team at a discount after just one season would send a terrible message. For better or worse, the Rangers already hitched their wagon to a high-priced, offensive-minded defenseman.
Offensive Defenseman Aplenty in New York
Here's the funny thing. In one or two years, Shattenkirk may not even be regarded as the best scoring defenseman on the team. Despite a dip in production in 2017-18, Brady Skjei has shown the talent to be a prolific offensive defenseman. He had 34 assists (39 points in total) in 2016-17, his first full NHL season. Despite this, now-former head coach Alain Vigneault barely used him on the power play, severely stunting his offensive output. There is no question Sjkei, who is just 24, has the potential to be a 50-55 point scorer.
And Skjei isn't the only young defenseman showing promise. Neal Pionk, 22, made his debut after the Rangers traded away many of their assets to close out the year. Pionk managed to score 14 points in 28 games, even though he was another player the coach rarely used on the power play.
Then there is the biggest wildcard of all, Tony Deangelo. So far, the hype has been bigger than his play. He has 22 points in 71 career games and his minus-31 is an eyesore. However, many people believed he was turning a corner in his development before sustaining a season-ending ankle injury in March.
None of these players is among the bevvy of defensive prospects the Rangers acquired in their various trades this year and don't factor in the loads of early round draft picks the team now has in 2018 and 2019. Ultimately, the last thing this team needs right now is a defenseman that can score a ton of points but is mediocre at best in the defensive end.
The Rangers Need a New Beukeboom
Ranger fans under the age of 25 may not know much about Jeff Beukeboom but older fans will vividly recall the hulking 6'5‚Ä≥, 230 pound defenseman anchoring a tandem with Brian Leetch. While Leetch was dazzling the crowd on a nightly basis with slick moves that few in the league could pull off, Beukeboom was blasting opposing forwards that dared get near the crease. He was a no nonsense defensive-defenseman who never scored more than 20 points for the Rangers despite playing in the waning years of an era where forwards might score 70 goals.
This is what the Rangers need, or for younger fans to conceptualize, they need Dan Girardi in his prime, an All-Star candidate despite barely scoring any points. Between Shattenkirk, Sjkei, Pionk, Deangelo and additional prospects coming in, the last thing the Rangers need to think about is bringing in Karlsson. What the team needs is to look at a player like Columbus Blue Jackets defenseman Ian Cole, who will be a free agent this summer and often averages over 150 hits per year.
Look Out for the 2019 Free Agents
The team can also look towards 2019 and going all-in on a more well-rounded defenseman like Oliver Ekman-Larsson, who can score 40 points and log over 150 hits per year while blocking nearly 80 shots. Obviously, being a good defenseman means more than throwing your body to block pucks but the point is that Ekman-Larsson is the two-way defender the Rangers need if they are looking to overhaul the team to contend by 2020.
It should be noted that there could be a host of defensemen in the free agent class of 2019 that would be a better fit for the team than Karlsson. There is no doubt he is a great player and there is also no doubt there are teams in the league where he will be a tremendous fit. The Vegas Golden Knights, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Vancouver Canucks immediately come to mind. But the Rangers are simply a bad fit for the future Hall of Famer.
Trading for him would be the sort of move the Rangers of old would make. Those teams went for the big name player regardless of fit and it was also why they missed the playoffs for seven straight seasons to start the 21st century. Rangers fans have to hope general manager Jeff Gorton sees this and says, thanks but no thanks if the Senators come calling.

Sahitya-award winning writer Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar, who is also a government doctor, has been suspended by the Jharkhand government, allegedly for penning the collection of short stories, ‚ÄúThe Adivasi Will Not Dance,‚Äù without taking permission.The government, on Friday, had banned the book for ‚Äúhurting the dignity‚Äù of Santhal tribal women and portraying them in a negative light.Health Minister Ramchandra Chandravansi told the state assembly on Saturday that Shekhar, who is posted in the state's Pakur district, has been placed under suspension with immediate effect. The authorities have also started seizing the book and are looking for the doctor, parliamentary affairs minister Saryu Roy said.Pakur Civil Surgeon NK Mehra, while speaking to The Telegraph, said he had received Shekhar's suspension order on Saturday and it would be delivered to the writer on Sunday.Shekhar, however, said he had not yet received the order. ‚ÄúI am a doctor and have to meet several people daily to treat them. I cannot afford to take pressure. I am absolutely okay,‚Äù he said. He also said he would not change the content of his book as it would impinge on his freedom of expression. He advised those who have a problem with the book to not read it.Although the book was published in 2015, protests against it have intensified only in August this year. On August 4, a group of Adivasis in Pakur took out protests against the writer, burnt his effigy as well as copies of the book. The matter was also taken up in the state assembly on Friday, with a legislator from Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, calling for the ban. Swift action followed.Critics of the book say that the book projects women from the Santhal tribe with lose morals, and say his fictionalized account of their lives resembles erotic literature. Citing an example BJP MLA Laxman Tudu said, ‚ÄúThe story says that the woman agreed to go to bed with anybody in lieu of something to eat. Is it not objectionable?‚ÄùThe government, meanwhile, has issued a notification saying that the content of the book may disturb law and order situation in the state. ‚ÄúThe book's contents are in contravention of provisions of various IPC Sections like 153A (Promoting enmity between different groups), 153B (Imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration) and 292 (Sale of obscene books),‚Äù the notification said.

British military officials say a vehicle has been removed from a village 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of Salisbury as part of the inquiry into the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy and his daughter.
A road in the village of Durrington was closed off and tents were erected as the military and police searched for clues Monday. The Ministry of Defense said the military presence was "part of our ongoing support to help police in the investigation."
Ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in critical condition in a Salisbury hospital more than two weeks after the March 4 attack.
The military did not say why the vehicle was removed. British media say it had been used to transport Yulia Skripal from the airport when she arrived in Britain a day before the attack.

5:30 p.m.
NATO's secretary-general says the alliance stands united with Britain amid diplomatic tensions with Russia over an ex-spy's poisoning in an English city.
Jens Stoltenberg said "all 29 NATO allies stand united. We stand in solidarity with the United Kingdom. The U.K. is not alone." He made the comments during a joint news conference with U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson at NATO headquarters.
Britain has accused Russia of being behind the March 4 attack in Salisbury with a Novichok nerve agent on ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter that has left them in critical condition. Moscow vehemently denies any involvement.
Stoltenberg said that "Russia's response so far has demonstrated a clear disregard for international peace and security. We continue to call on Russia to provide the complete disclosure of the Novichok program."

12:05 p.m.
The Kremlin says Britain will eventually have to offer proof to back up its claim of Russia's involvement in the poisoning of an ex-spy ‚Äî or apologize.
President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that the "slanderous anti-Russian flow coming from Britain is inexplicable, unfounded and driven by unclear motives."
He told reporters that Britain will have "to back it with some kind of proof or offer excuses."
Britain has accused Russia of using a military-grade nerve agent to poison former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, who have been in critical condition for two weeks. Britain has announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats, and Russia has responded in kind.
The European Union on Monday condemned Skripal's poisoning, and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson dismissed Moscow's denials as absurd.
___
10 a.m.
British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is describing Russian claims that it is not responsible for the poisoning of a former spy as absurd, and says the U.K. has the full backing of its European partners.
Johnson told reporters in Brussels Monday that "Russian denials grow increasingly absurd," with contradictory claims about whether Russia produced the nerve agent Novichok used in the March 4 attack that left Sergei Skripal and his daughter in critical condition.
He said "what people can see is that this is a classic Russian strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a haystack of lies and obfuscation."
Johnson, speaking before briefing European Union foreign ministers on developments, said many in the bloc have been victims of "malign Russian behavior" and that Moscow is "not fooling anybody anymore."
