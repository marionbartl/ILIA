The much anticipated March FOMC minutes were released today, and the minutes concluded exactly what I predicted in my last post titled "Is the Fed Trying to stop a "Market" that has gotten ahead of itself". In it I said that the only reason they were raising rates unexpectedly is because they are trying to slow the bubble from getting any bigger. The minutes confirmed that the February 'out of nowhere talk' of a rate hike, which led to a March rate hike, was all due to stocks and many other assets classes being a bubble. FOMC officials are now openly admitting that their disastrous policies have created the largest asset bubbles in history, which has never been done before. On multiple occasions in years prior, many Fed officials, including former chair Greenspan, have openly said that it was very hard to spot asset bubbles in advance. Now they are openly saying that they are seeing bubbles. Many current Fed officials share that same stupid viewpoint as Greenspan, including Kashkari, Fisher and Powell. Powell, just this past January at a conference in Chicago, said "low rates can lead to excessive leverage and broadly unsustainable asset prices - things that we watch carefully for and do not observe at this point." So it was surprising to see the following In today's minutes from the March meeting:
In their discussion of recent developments in financial markets, participants noted that financial conditions remained accommodative despite the rise in longer-term interest rates in recent months and continued to support the expansion of economic activity. Many participants discussed the implications of the rise in equity prices over the past few months, with several of them citing it as contributing to an easing of financial conditions. A few participants attributed the recent equity price appreciation to expectations for corporate tax cuts or to increased risk tolerance among investors rather than to expectations of stronger economic growth. Some participants viewed equity prices as quite high relative to standard valuation measures. It was observed that prices of other risk assets, such as emerging market stocks, high-yield corporate bonds, and commercial real estate, had also risen significantly in recent months. In contrast, prices of farmland reportedly had edged lower, in part because low commodity prices continued to weigh on farm income. Still, farmland valuations were said to remain quite high as gauged by standard benchmarks such as rent-to-price ratios.
And also this major point:
In addition, a number of participants remarked that recent and prospective changes in financial conditions posed upside risks to their economic projections, to the extent that financial developments provided greater stimulus to spending than currently anticipated, as well as downside risks to their economic projections if, for example, financial markets were to experience a significant correction. Participants also mentioned potential developments abroad that could have adverse implications for the U.S. economy.
Wait what? Didn't Yellen themselves say in June of 2016 that the Fed doesn't target stock prices. Yes they did. That's what makes this whole circus truly funny. Their polices of QE and years of ZIRP were to supposedly help create growth, and get the economy back on track. It was the "tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists" who said from the beginning, that the experiment that the fed was embarking on would not help the economy, but rather help the stock market and Wall Street. Even four former fed officials, Richard Fischer, Thomas Hoenig, Charles Plosser, and Jeremy Stein shared the same view as these evil conspiracy theorists. Plosser put quite well in an interview for the documentary "Money For Nothing" by saying: "Stimulating the economy through monetary policy really does almost nothing to contribute to low unemployment rates or high employment in the long term. Printing money doesn't produce goods and services, it doesn't hire people."
But this is not the first time the Fed has warned that stock valuations are high, but it was the first time that they admitted that they have created, as Trump said, a Huge Bubble. Sometimes it can take a while, years in this case, for the people out of touch with reality who are put into positions to fix the economy that they destroyed, to finally see reality.
The news that India is introducing a new tax on car sales to help combat severe air pollution and congestion problems has unsurprisingly been decried by the country's car industry.
The chair of India's largest car manufacturer, Maruti Suzuki, says the tax “is going to hurt the industry, and will impact growth and affect job creation”. Following the announcement, shares in Maruti Suzuki traded more than 5% lower.
But others have celebrated the move, recognising that business as usual cannot continue in a country home to the four most polluted cities in the world. “Once Indians owning cars was seen as a sign of economic success. Now this sort of tax is seen as Indians being responsible,” a senior research fellow at a Delhi-based thinktank told the Guardian.
The tax comes on the heels of the Delhi government's unprecedented step this winter of imposing an emergency “odd-even” license plate number rule to restrict private car use to alternate days.
Reports of extreme air pollution in Delhi and other Indian cities are nothing new. The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 600,000 people die each year as a result of outdoor air pollution in India. Much less discussed is the fact that not all residents are equally affected, nor equally responsible.
As the rich get richer everyone else gets less happy Read more
Delhi's low-income residents – who don't travel by car – bear the brunt of the city's toxic air. This is partly because of where they live. A 2011 study found levels of suspended particulates to be generally higher in the city's poorer neighbourhoods.
The poor also spend more time outdoors, where pollution is most intense. A study in the scientific journal Atmospheric Environment reports that men from low-income households spend on average about seven hours outdoors daily, compared to virtually zero for those at the top of the income scale.
What's more, affluent households can afford air conditioning, better nutrition and better healthcare, all of which insulate them, to some extent, from dirty air.
Some of the highest pollution exposures are inflicted on those who make their living on the streets, including traffic police and drivers of three-wheeled auto-rickshaws. These rickshaws have been converted to compressed natural gas, a cleaner fuel source, as a result of a 1998 supreme court ruling in a case brought by environmental advocates.
Many of Delhi's cars, by contrast, continue to burn particulate-heavy diesel. Researchers have measured concentrations of hazardous ultra-fine particles on the city's arterial roads that are eight times higher than those recorded on rooftop monitors just a kilometre away
The health impacts on residents are becoming more and more evident. Children's developing bodies are especially susceptible to long-term harm. A 2008 study for India's Central Pollution Control Board reported that more than two-fifths of Delhi's schoolchildren have reduced lung function, damage that is likely to be irreversible.
The good news is that there is rising demand from India's citizens for cleaner air, coupled with greater willingness of Delhi's populist Aam Aadmi (roughly translated as common man) government, elected a year ago, to respond. Delhi needs ambitious, longer-term policies to tackle root causes of the problem. These must include not only steps to halt the exponential growth in car traffic and diesel trucks but also huge new investments in public transportation, tougher pollution controls on the smoke-belching power plants and brick kilns that ring the capital's perimeter, and measures to reduce the clouds of dust from construction debris and road traffic.
The best thing a business could do for the environment is shut down Read more
Beneath the headlines, Delhi's air pollution is not only a public health disaster; it is a classic case of environmental injustice. The city's affluent classes reap the lion's share of the benefits from the activities that poison the air, while less privileged residents bear most of the human health costs. This fateful disjuncture – and the inequalities of wealth and power that lie behind it – has posed the single biggest impediment to addressing the problem.
It remains to be seen whether the authorities in Delhi can muster the political will to go beyond stopgap emergency measures and launch the policies that are desperately needed to safeguard the public interest in a clean environment against the private interests of the polluting classes. Will India, often hailed as the world's largest democracy, be able to overcome the oligarchy that rules its air? The poor who bear the heaviest air pollution burdens wish they could hold their breath long enough to find out.
I have received a few requests about making a video that will cover UV Mapping as well as a few others asking for a video on making a low poly model and then transferring the details from a high poly to the low poly model (Bake down the textures). Well this post should be the answer to the first request, and a base for the second one as you need to know UVW unwrapping if you ever want to do get into low poly models and baking (most notably for gaming). And lets see how this goes.
So you made your first 3D model that is not a primitive geometry, and now you want to add a texture to it. What happens now though is that once you apply the texture to it, it simply doesn't look anything like the texture, either that or you are getting a flat color. Well the reason for this is that when you have a model that is simply more complex than the standard primitives, you need to UVW Unwrap that model.
So how do i UVW unwrap a model?
Well the first thing you need to understand is what is UVW Unwrapping? The definition of unwrapping is the process in which you are telling your software how to apply a 2D image (texture) to a 3D model. So in order to be able to make that transition from a 2D plane to a 3D model we have our UVW Unwrap modifier in 3ds Max. If you want to get a better idea on how the logic behind unwrapping works simply think about wrapping a present. At the moment of writing this article is before Christmas and New Year so it would be easy to think about it in this manner. Let's say that you have bought a friend or a family member a a sculpture or a toy of some sort and you want to wrap it in a nice festive wrapping paper. The thing is that you don't want to box it, but instead you want to wrap the paper around the gift without making the paper look all squished and garbled up. In order to keep the paper on top of your present all nice and festive, you will need to cut it up in smaller pieces, and then glue or tape them all back together. Well this is EXACTLY what UVW mapping is doing, it's taking the wrapping paper, cutting it into small manageable pieces and then putting it all back together. So that's the general idea behind it, so now lets jump in and see the technical approach to it in 3ds Max.
In the first video we will cover the basics of unwrapping, as well as get our feet wet with unwrapping a Box a 3D Rectangle and a Cylinder. By unwrapping these few simple models we will see how to work with the UVW Unwrap modifier and how the Unfold and Flatten mapping works. I won't keep explaining much more than you will be able to see all about it in the actual video here.
In the second part of the video we jump over to unwrapping a Cone and a Torus (Fancy word for a Doughnut). With the help of these two models we will learn more about Stitching and Breaking of UV islands as well as Pelt Mapping. So again i leave you with the video so you can see it for yourself.
And the third part of the Unwrapping series will cover unwrapping a Sphere, Geo Sphere and a modified Teapot. With the help of the Sphere and the Geo Sphere we will learn more about the Quick Peel option and the Point to Point seams cutting. And the modified teapot is there so that we can try and use everything we saw in these videos and get the teapot unwrapped.
So with that we more or less round up the basics of the UVW unwrapping. Now just to make it clear this is not all there is to say about UVW unwrapping, not even by a long shot, but it is enough to know to have a base on which you can continue to build upon.
Before i forget and finish up with this post, if you want to use the texture i used or some other UV Checker texture you can get them for free from Google, but if you don't know how to get them (I really see no reason as to why not, but hey …) then simply follow this link straight to a Google Search.
And that would be it for this post, so if you managed to learn something new and you liked the videos, then help spread the word and like and share the video on YouTube and Facebook.

The study of data collected in the first research campaign of DAN Europe's Diving Safety Laboratory (DSL) “Flying bubbles” project has concluded. The results are somewhat surprising, to such extent as to merit publication in Aviation Space and Environmental Medicine, a revered scientific magazine.
Different Theories
We have seen what comes before, what goes on during, and now… there will be a “what happens after.” In the realm of post-dive flights, DAN's “Flying bubbles” project marks the divide between theory and fact.
Before this project there were varied recommendations of how long to wait after a dive before taking a plane in order to avoid the risk of decompression problems, caused by cabin depressurization. However, all this was based only on theory: in DAN's case, the duration of the wait period was established by monitoring actual decompression illness situations, while in other cases, it was based on the assumption that “until now there haven't been many problems, so let's just keep doing as we're doing.”
Those who have used the old U.S. Navy tables probably have vague memories of having to be categorized as group “D” before flying. In certain cases it was even possible to fly immediately! Subsequently, fixed intervals were added (24 or 48 hours), depending on whether the last dive was a single or a repetitive one, and whether within the curve or outside the curve. Even among commercial divers and military divers the wait times before boarding a commercial plane varies from 2 to 24 hours.
In 1989, the first “Flying After Diving” workshop was held; organized by the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society. The guidelines provided at the workshop, according to DAN, were not very restrictive and were implemented to improve diving safety. However, many of the dive center owners protested, saying that such implementation would damage dive center affairs on islands.
From 1992 to 1999, DAN carried out experiments in Duke University Medical Center's F.G. Hall Laboratory, monitoring over 500 subjects in 800 flight simulations. They were simulations because these “flights” took place in a hyperbaric chamber. DAN further investigated the relationship between the risk of decompression illness and the surface interval before flying in a case controlled study, an analysis of past events where incidents occurred or did not occur.
However, in many areas of medicine, laboratory studies have yielded, and can yield, results that differ from those obtained in “the field.” Also, some phenomena cannot be replicated in the laboratory. You can find evidence of this discrepancy in an article published by Alert Diver (European Edition, 3/2006) by Dr R. Vann: “Flying or reaching high altitudes after multiple dives over a span of days cannot be an object of study in a laboratory (hyperbaric chamber).”
In 2011, while returning from a research trip in the Maldives, Dr. Danilo Cialoni and Massimo Pieri, both part of our research dept. (Diving Safety Laboratory), had a fascinating idea that would involve DAN Europe Research (in particular Prof. Alessandro Marroni and Prof. Costantino Balestra): a research project that sounded like a challenge… to administer cardiac echoes directly during a flight proceeding a diving trip.
Cardiac Echo in Flight
Conducting such a challenge was difficult, almost impossible, especially getting through all the red tape. In this, two DAN partners, Albatros Top Boat and Neos Air, were fundamental. In order to obtain EMI (ElectroMagnetic Interference) certification, necessary to use the echo during flight, DAN Europe technicians and researchers had to spend many hours of the night at the Milan Malpensa airport. In the end, the challenge was overcome, and for the first time, we were able to see what really occurs in the body of a diver during flight.
In just the first week of research in the Maldives over 4,000 files were registered, which has obviously been followed by a long and accurate analysis.
The methodology of cardiac echo monitoring consists of four control phases. The first takes place during the outbound flight when the diver has not been on a dive in at least 48 hours. These first tests are useful to have data that has not yet been influenced by hyperbaric exposure, and to determine what in medical jargon is referred to as the “echocardiographic window.” Registering an accurate measurement of the cabin pressure every 15 minutes is made possible by using the Dive System “iDive Pro” dive computer, a partner of DSL and DAN Europe.
In the second phase, echocardiography and other tests are administered after each dive over the span of a week on a cruise. Weeks of specific research become part of the regular rhythm onboard the beautiful “Duke of York” cruise ship; not so dissimilar to a normal cruise to the Maldives, but with a routine of scientific importance: Each time a diver surfaces, he/she must go to the spa, which, for the occasion, has been transformed into a “research room” and medical care center, and undergo various tests.
Dive profiles are checked by the computer and downloaded for the following tests. All the dives are done within the safety curve, surfacing happens at the correct speed, and a safety stop of 3 minutes at about 5 metres depth is always respected. None of the divers have ever suffered decompression illness.
The third control phase takes place in the airport, where cardiac echoes are taken of the divers right before boarding the plane, after a 24 hour surface interval.
In the final phase, during the inbound flight, all divers are monitored by cardiac echo and doppler exactly 30, 60, and 90 minutes after the aircraft reaches cruising altitude.
Data analysis
The research project was presented in 2013 at the EUBS (European Underwater and Baromedical Society) conference, and received the Zetterström Award for the best scientific poster presentation.
Some of the collected data is easy to understand. For example, during examination on the outbound flight no bubbles were observed in any of the divers participating in the study. Although it seems like an obvious result, this test needed to be done because it gives proof that if bubbles were to be found in the divers during the return flight, they would not have been caused by the flight itself, but by the combined effect of diving and subsequent depressurization in flight.
Other data revealed by the study was unexpected. For example, it has always been believed that a flight of long duration poses greater risk in respect to a flight of medium duration; instead it is exactly the opposite. This is most likely due to the altitude of the aircraft pressurization, approximately 1500-1800 metres above sea level for travel to the Maldives, and 2400 metres above sea level (maximum allowed) for trips to closer destinations.
The examination of divers in the airport before the return trip, in which no bubbles were observed, has allowed us to estimate that an interval of 24 hours wait time is sufficient when remaining at sea level, so no bubbles can form.
Obviously, some divers develop more bubbles than others, even for those with very similar dive profiles. The examinations during the week on the cruise allowed the subjects to be divided into three categories: those who do not develop bubbles, those who occasionally develop bubbles, and those “bubble-prone” divers who develop bubbles after every dive. To obtain a consistent comparison, the dive profiles must have little influence on the categorization (it is obvious that a weighty profile can show more bubbles than a light one).
The analysis in flight has revealed that the majority of divers did not develop bubbles during the return flight with a 24 hour interval after the last dive, but the “bubble-prone” divers did. Therefore, it's advisable that those who are a part of this category should further elongate their wait time before a flight. During the week, two of the subjects showed to be “super bubble-prone,” and they were advised to not take their last dive, making their wait time before flying 36 hours. It's of significance that neither of the divers developed bubbles during the flight. For those who easily develop bubbles, a wait time of over 24 hours is opportune. Alternatively, DAN Research suggests the preventative measure of breathing normobaric oxygen.
The highest bubble levels were seen 30 minutes after reaching cruising altitude, and then diminishing during the 60 minute to 90-minute period; basically like how it is returning to the surface after a dive. On the other hand, depressurization acts like surfacing and yields the same effects. As time passes at that altitude, the body desaturates, and the bubbles diminish. There is another possible explanation: the tiny bubbles are already present in the blood, but are so small that they cannot be observed with a normal Echocardiogram. The depressurization could increase their dimensions and render them more visible.
What future outcomes could this study entail for divers? As stated by Prof. Alessandro Marroni, “We are headed straight toward a future where the individual component can influence the mathematic model, placing greater emphasis on the practical application of research in diving safety. Until today, we have applied mathematics, with its present algorithms, when studying the body, but today we are starting a new, fascinating pathway that will help to incorporate simple physiological parameters in mathematics, rendering those algorithms better adapted to our organism. The future lies ahead, and DAN Europe has decided to take it on in the best way possible, with the helps of divers; making them aware of current and future advancements.

It is often assumed extroverts do best in life, but according to a new best-selling book, introverts are just as high achievers. It claims there is a bias towards extroverts in Western society. So do we discriminate against introverts?
Barack Obama, JK Rowling and Steve Wozniak.
They might not immediately stand out as introverts, but according to Susan Cain, American author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts In a World That Can't Stop Talking, they are.
That is because they say, contrary to popular opinion, introverts are not necessarily shy or anti-social, they just prefer environments that are not over-stimulating and get their energy from quiet time and reflection.
Conversely, extroverts need to be around other people to recharge their batteries.
Cain argues that although a third of the population are introverts, most institutions, from schools to workplaces, are geared towards extroverts, while introverts are often undervalued or misunderstood.
Extroversion and introversion Extroverts are typically seen as outgoing, confident and happy to join in conversation
Introverts are thought of as quiet and inwardly thoughtful
One school of thought, first popularised by Carl Jung, and later adopted by the authors of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator personality tests, says everyone falls into one camp or another
A second school of thought argues there is a scale of extroversion
"Whether it is job adverts using words such as 'upbeat, people person and team players', practices like open-plan offices or brainstorming, the overall ability to put yourself out there is the great value of the age.
"But research shows there is no correlation between the most talkative person in the room and the best ideas," they say.
The self-identified introvert says there is a similar pattern in schools, where speaking up in class, group work and "show and tells" is emphasised.
They also cite studies which suggest that the majority of teachers think the ideal student is an extrovert, and more extroverts are groomed for leadership positions in the workplace.
Image caption Mark Dykeman says they learnt how to act like an extrovert in meetings
Them book, which hopes to rehabilitate the introvert, has struck a chord with readers and sparked a debate among commentators and armchair psychologists, while herTED talk has been watched by 1.5 million viewers.
In American magazine Wired, Clive Thompsonthinks Cain's book might help introverts get a better reputation. But in theNew York Times, introvert author Judith Warnerargues that a "more quiet argument" would have been much more effective.
Meanwhile the Guardian'sJon Ronsonis bemused that after concluding their whole family are ambiverts - which Cain defines as a mixture of extrovert and introvert - the group barely gets a mention in the book.
One introvert who can relate to Cain's campaign is Mark Dykeman, an IT business analyst from Canada. The 42-year-old, who has written a number ofblogs on introversion, agrees there are plus points to being an introvert, but says it can be difficult.
"At university there was a lot of encouragement and pressure to socialise with other people. I was OK with that for short periods of time, but after a certain point it became very tiring.
"It wasn't until I was in the workforce and I had training that I started to understand the difference between introverts and extroverts. It opened my eyes to how I'd been thinking about certain situations, and gave me a bit of comfort," they say.
Dykeman says they found it difficult to voice an opinion in meetings earlier on in their career, but soon realised they needed to speak up and make points.
"I learnt how to act like an extrovert. I think a lot of people learn the rules of the game learn to function.
"It can be a bit harder, but everyone can contribute. I'd suggest anyone that does feel uncomfortable in public settings educates themselves on introversion," they say.
Image caption Susan Cain tags JK Rowling and Barack Obama as introverts
Felicity Lee, a chartered occupational psychologist, says it is perfectly possible for introverts to try to act like an extrovert, but it will be more tiring for them.
American and Canadian culture tends to value the qualities of extroverts more than other cultures, but Lee thinks a bias towards extroversion also exists in the workplace and wider society in Britain.
But they say just because someone is an extrovert, it does not necessarily mean they do extroversion well.
"Someone can be an extrovert or an introvert and very self-aware and socially skilled. Or they can be very unaware. Extroversion has nothing to do with emotional intelligence, or competence," they say.
Lee also points out that there is evidence to suggest that whatever the psychological nuances, most people just want to be an extrovert.
"In the 1990s, when the Myers-Briggs personality type test went through validation with UK and Europe distributors, 92% of people said it was better to be extrovert, even though only half of the population is extrovert in the type version," they say.
Anecdotally, when you go back to the school playground, children would probably say it is better to be an extrovert - to be social and have friends, they add.
Cain's 'introverts' Barack Obama - "Obama's not a shy introvert, but they are one. In their book, Dreams From My Father, they identify themselves with a lonely old man who lives in their building," says Susan Cain. "Introversion has been one of their assets. They plan their campaigns intricately and gives very cerebral speeches."

Steven Wozniak - Cain says we often associate Steve Jobs with Apple because of their dazzling statements, but Wozniak is credited with designing much of the first Apple computer by himself. "He still advises people to work in solitude," Cain says.

"He still advises people to work in solitude," Cain says. JK Rowling -"The Harry Potter author has described themselves as an introvert, particularly when they refer to their childhood," they add.
Jo Silvester, a professor of organisational psychology at Cass Business School, says it is easy to see why such desirability exists.
They say most organisations looking to recruit would steer towards extroverts, on the assumption that they make better leaders.
But Silvester says some industries do not necessarily attract the types of personalities people might think.
"Politicians for example are a lot more introverted. In politics it doesn't pay to show all of your cards too quickly, and introverts are more willing to stand back and listen and take extra time to come up with a conclusion.
"People would probably assume sales requires extroversion, because they deal with a lot of people all of the time. But if somebody is selling to research chemists, they might need to be more introverted, as people tend to get on best with people like themselves," they say.
Image caption Many people prefer a "doer" to someone who likes to contemplate
However, Richard Dodd, at the British Retail Consortium, says the notion of dividing people up into extroverts and introverts is over-simplistic as there are many more variables in people's characters.
They think people naturally tend to gravitate towards jobs that suit their personal qualities and make the best use of their abilities.
But they say most successful teams and workplaces have a mixture of individuals with a range of characteristics and qualities.
"There is a place for selling yourself and making sure your achievements are recognised in most jobs, which might be easier for some personality types than others," they say.
"But I think in successful organisations the approach to management and appraisal is to be able to get beyond the superficial impression, and to make sure people's contributions are identified and recognised - regardless of whether people are shouting from the rooftops."

Ad spending in Georgia's Sixth Congressional District race has reached nearly $40 million, easily cementing the congressional contest as the most expensive of its kind in U.S. history, according to new data shared with NBC News.
The numbers, compiled by Advertising Analytics, show that Republicans have narrowly edged out Democrats in total ad spending for the primary and runoff elections in the high-stakes congressional showdown, with GOP organizations spending a total of $21 million on the airwaves to defend the reliably Republican seat vacated by now-Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. Democrats, boosted by record-setting fundraising by candidate Jon Ossoff, have spent a total of $18.7 million on the air.
The mammoth cost of the special election contest dwarfs past records — previous high-dollar races topped out around $20 million in television and radio spending — and it highlights how the race has become a national proxy war between the two parties. Despite its history as a Republican bastion, the suburban Atlanta district's affluent and well-educated population selected Donald Trump by the narrowest of margins in 2016, making the special election a particularly ripe target for Democrats desperate to notch a win against the president.
Ossoff, who has smashed fundraising records by amassing millions in mostly out-of-state donations, is the top spender on either side of the aisle, shelling out $13.6 million on TV and radio advertisements since the beginning of the primary election. That's compared to just $2.3 million in spending by Republican Karen Handel, who secured their spot in the June 20 runoff election in an earlier primary contest in April.
But Republican outside groups have compensated for Handel's spending deficit. The National Republican Congressional Committee has spent about $6.5 million on advertisements, while the Paul Ryan-affiliated Congressional Leadership Fund has paid out an additional $4.8 million.
That high level of spending is particularly striking because Price, who held the seat from 2004 until this year, walloped their latest Democratic opponent by more than 20 points, and both John McCain and Mitt Romney carried the area by double digits.
Democratic Party groups have spent far less on ads in the race, leaning instead on Ossoff's record-setting war chest. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has spent $4.3 million, and the House Majority PAC — the primary Super PAC charged with electing Democrats to the House —has spent only about $254,00 so far. (Another group, Patriot Majority USA, which has partnered with the House Majority PAC, has put up an additional $281,000.)
The Democratic reliance on Ossoff's spending — with nearly three-quarters of all Democratic ad spending coming directly from the candidate's coffers — also comes with an important benefit for the pro-Ossoff side. Because candidates receive more favorable rates for ads than issue groups, Democrats have actually been able to air more ads despite being outspent by the GOP overall.
Advertising Analytics found that about 60 percent of the 24,000 ads aired during the race have been funded by Democrats, compared to 40 percent paid for by Republicans.
And Democrats have had even more of an advantage during the two-candidate runoff election, with the pro-Ossoff side airing about twice as many ads as the pro-Handel side.
According to data presented by the Ministry of Finance, on Thursday, the Greek primary budget surplus is amounting to 2.67 billion euros ($3.68 billion) for the first 11 months of the year, remaining on track to meet annual fiscal targets.
As reported by the website of the Wall Street Journal, the surplus stands at 1.2 billion euros between January and November of 2013, excluding bond profit returns of €1.5 billion from the European central banks to Greece.
Earlier this week, the Greek Parliament voted on the 2014 budget, which shows that the expected primary surplus of 812 million euros for 2013. This amount is double the government's forecasts from two months ago.
This is Greece's first primary surplus in a decade, enabling the Greek government to negotiate under new terms with its creditors, the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
For the first 11 months of the year, the government's revenue income decreased to 42.7 billion euros from 42.9 billion, slightly falling off the annual target.
The spendings for the same period, fell to 50.3 billion euros, from 58.7 billion euros in the corresponding period in 2012.
The state budget only includes the operations of Greece's central government, and not general government accounts, which contain local government, military spending, and some further national accounts.
The American Civil Liberties Union is taking aim at one small Indiana town's Christmas tree.
The ACLU of Indianapolis is suing the town of Knightstown over a Christmas tree because it includes a lighted cross at the top of the tree, Fox News reported.
It was only recently that the town has faced opposition over the cross on top of the tree, Fox 59 Indianapolis reported.
“A couple weeks ago they had a crowd here,” said Knightstown resident Mark Tompkins. “Everybody was here. Everybody was fine with it. But now you've got one person, you know, out of everybody.”
Tompkins disagrees with the ACLU lawsuit even though their relative is the plaintiff, according to Fox 59.
The ACLU says in the lawsuit that Joseph Tompkins takes issue with the cross because it violates the separation of church and state.
The lawsuit, which was filed Thursday, says they have been “forced to come into unwelcome contact” with the display, causing them “irreparable harm.”
Tompkins also objects to their tax dollars being used to fund the display, according to court documents.
“I think we can find people in this town that can replace that 0.0004 cents to give to them and not have to worry about it,” Knightstown business person Lau Ghioc said in response to Tompkins' objection.
Tompkins wants the town to remove the cross and pay them monetary damages, the Indianapolis Star reports.
A Knightstown representative never returned the paper's requests for comment.
Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton's longtime right-hand woman, has finally pulled the plug on husband and progressive pervert Anthony Weiner, a disgraced former Democrat U.S. Congressman from New York.
On Friday, Anthony Weiner pleaded guilty to pleaded guilty to texting pornographic pictures of their junk to at least one underage girl.
The NY Post reports that the just hours after Weiner's plea, Abedin fired their divorce papers:
Abedin had originally filed for an uncontested divorce, but then soon amended their papers to say “contested” — suggesting that Weiner decided at the last minute not to sign on the dotted line. Now, the two will likely face a long, costly court battle, experts predicted. Not so much over money — Abedin, a longtime close aide to Hillary Clinton, is apparently between jobs, and Weiner has lost at least four jobs in the six years since their first sexting scandal. Experts said the fight will be over visitation for their 5-year-old son, Jordan.
According to ABC News, Weiner offered an apology to the teenage girl in federal court Friday, admitting that they have a “sickness.”
Weiner agreed to surrender their iPhone and will register as a sex offender. The sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 8.
That's what you call a bad day. First, Weiner, who before getting caught was a leading voice for Democrats, pleads guilty and then they receive divorce papers the same day.

CBS News reporters have been turned away and threatened with arrest, prevented from reporting on the impact of oil coming ashore in Louisiana, by contractors from BP, apparently working in conjunction with the US Coast Guard. Earlier in the drama of the Gulf oil disaster, US Fish & Wildlife Service cut off access to certain wildlife refuges to limit the impact of troops of journalists marching over nesting habitat, but this seems different. Here's video of the incident:
What's more, this doesn't seem to be isolated. Mother Nature Network:
Contacts in Louisiana have given me numerous, unconfirmed reports of cameras and cell phones being confiscated, scientists with monitoring equipment being turned away, and local reporters blocked from access to public lands impacted by the oil spill.
Unconfirmed until this CBS video at least. A man, apparently from the USCG, says "These are BP's rule. These are not our rules."
Massive Miscommunication or Fascist Collusion?
Given the general scale of the cleanup--a huge number of cleanup crews covering a large area--I wouldn't necessarily jump to the Feds being in bed with BP right away.
Yes, Obama has gotten a good deal of money from BP; yes, without a doubt, several government agencies have been too cozy with oil companies; and yes, there does seem to be a concerted media push to make it seem like the clean up is going well.
And in light of BP's reluctance to release underwater footage of the gusher itself--and then when it is released independent analysis shows official estimates of flow rates and underestimated by at least a factor of ten--it's easy to see some sort of fascist collusion going on, when it all may just be confusion.
That said, unless legitimate safety or wildlife protection concerns emerge which would necessitate prohibiting access to an otherwise public beach--and they may exist--I would have to agree with MNM's Karl Burkart:
It looks as if the Coast Guard has been given direct orders to protect BP's PR interests above safety concerns, over air and water quality, above the outcries of local governments in need of aid, and (worst of all) above the need for the American public to be informed about what is really going on in the Gulf.

Two researchers head into the target chamber at the National Ignition Facility in Livermore, California, where the world's largest laser is being completed. The laser, built for fusion research, has already shown the ability to fire 4 megajoules of infrared energy for up to 20 nanoseconds. Shot into both ends of a tiny gold capsule filled with two frozen hydrogen isotopes, this powerful blast will create plasma around the pea-size target in the center of the capsule. The resulting heat, researchers hope, will fuse the two isotopes inside—leading to virtually endless energy. The immediate goals are to test the current optics, which amplify and shape the laser beam, and then to complete construction of the laser by March 2009. Researchers are optimistic that by 2010 they will achieve “ignition,” the point where more energy is coming out than is being put in. We have been hearing this sort of promise from fusion researchers for years, of course, but this time, scientists have a giant laser to help them deliver the goods.

Geo·dissonance: the metal movement is proliferating to all corners of the globe. In its relentless display of vitriolic truths and the ugliest questions of existence, we can hear the resounding riffs of heavy metal in the most conservative pockets of society. As your Punjabi, riff-worshiping correspondent, I've created Geodissonance to report the controversy: as metal unveils dissonance in cradles of brutality around the world.
In the streets of Botswana, the patriotic identity has evolved into a form deceptively close to our own: heavy metal counter-culture. The sight of young metalheads in tight leather clothes, spikes, and chains – what we might classify as a throwback to the NWOBHM form – has become the national image of a modern-age, guardian angel. Youth aspire to adopt the metal “way,” and parents encourage their children to interact with members of this burgeoning, local culture. Thus, in a country known exceedingly for its wildlife preserves and representative democracy, heavy metal has found an unexpected niche, and is claiming its rights to defy old stereotypes, and encapsulate African culture. The proof? It can easily be found in the lyrics of Botswanan band Skinflint, through to the treasured, metal library purportedly possessed by the country's president, himself, Ian Khama.
The regression of the metal appearance in Botswana is a sharp contrast to the “metal style,” as it exists in the states, today. As opposed to the more common American approach, à la band t-shirt, jeans, and sneaks, Botswana's metalheads have brought back the New Wave of British Heavy Metal feel; black leather, skulled belt-buckles, chains, and cowboy hats infuse the old, heavy metal appearances with the familiar nuances of American-bred, Hell's Angels. The style is surely reminiscent of an old era, but no less inspired by extreme music; the sight of Cannibal Corpse shirts is no less common than those of Iron Maiden, or Judas.
The emergence of Botswana's metal style is the proof of an ongoing, yet long-standing cultural evolution – one that grew, analogously to American metal, from the seedlings of classic rock. It's an evolution to which Frank Marshall – South African photographer – is no stranger. According to Marshall, “metal was seeded [here] by a classic rock band that started in the early 70s. Since then, it's evolved and grown.” Marshall has showcased their photography of Botswana metalheads at their own, Renegades exhibition, in Johannesburg. Through their shots, they wish to capture the shift, which, they added, “in the last 10 to 20 years, [has] come to be visually composed of what it looks like now – the guys dressed in leather. It started off with classic rock and later on more extreme forms of metal were introduced.”
The sense of community amongst Botswana metalheads is undeniable – the sort of brother-to-sister “camaraderie” that maintains “strong bond[s] and friendship[s]” between fans of the genre. It was a connection that Marshall witnessed most physically at local metal shows. In contrast to the often visible distances between concertgoers (e.g. friends, moshers, and the far-away, unwounded onlookers), Botswana metalheads are “very physical.” At shows, “you don't just shake [their] hands. They'll grab your hand and shake you around.”
The physical contact is an initiation for new listeners, as well as a shared manifestation of their underlying aggression. They collectively “embody the very aggressive elements of metal," through what is ultimately, "an expression of power." It is a ferocity of the mind that is palpable in their speech, and “deliberate, lurching strides.”
For any spectator from the “West,” the seeming rituals of Botswana metalheads may “seem bizarre and comical;” names like Demon and Gunsmoke make these rockers that much easier to dismiss, as caricatural or trite. Nonetheless, amongst members of the metal and non-metal community, they are treated with acceptance, and oftentimes, admiration. With the status they have attained through their music is an associated, social responsibility – both to their community, and the preservation of the Botswanan heritage, itself. Metal artists and fans are similarly aware of this social influence, and have readily expressed their desire to “portray a good figure," and serve as "good role models.” To them, metal is not a superficial or skin-deep engagement; while it is usually regarded as a “hardcore thing,” commented Botswanan metal artist, Gunsmoke, “it's something in our heart, too.” The Botswana self-identification lay not only in a love for metal, but for one another – “it's all about brothers in arms. Brothers in metal – we're there for each other.” Community and music are the dual components of how “[we] identify ourselves.”
Ironically, the potentially overpowering appearance of Botswana metalheads is no cause for local concern. Rather than reproach these rockers for their appearance or aggressive riffs, locals approach them with affection and gratitude. Thus, if we were to make an association between the appearance of Botswana headbangers to Hell's Angels, we would be fatally mistaken; according to Gunsmoke, the metal community is seen as a group of “guardian angels,” rather than hell-sent, threats to national order. It's a testimony well-supported by Botswana families; Gunsmoke added that “kids follow us around. Parents approach us.” There is a tacitly understood notion that metalheads are “there for a good cause,” namely, to “help people on the streets at night.” Given the invested interactions between bands, and the community, “heavy metal [has become] more than just a scene – it's part of the national identity.”
Unlike many of their nationally repressed and emerging, global counterparts (think: Indonesian headbangers, and Iraq-based Janaza!), Botswana bands fear no governmental scorn. Gunsmoke posed the question themselves – “why should [we] be scared when our president is a rocker?” According to Gunsmoke, not only is Ian Khama a metalhead, but a source of great pride for Botswana metalheads, as the “one man…leading the nation.”
Botswana metalheads aspire to give their homeland a globally recognized, positive reputation. “Bots is known as a small country," which “people used to think…was a province of south Africa.” Thus, Botswana bands are increasingly determined to create a unique, cultural identity for Botswana, in the international arena; it seems quite plausible, with a metal movement that ties the essential elements of metal, with an ancestral connection to one's culture and heritage. As Gunsmoke described, “most of us are in a tribe," and the "animal totems" they carry invariably represent the specific culture to which they belong.
The symbolism of the totems is mirrored by Botswana metal's lyrical content. According to Giuseppe, the lead singer of Botswana band Skinflint, African tales and mythology are ineffaceable elements of their music. “We have a lot of ancestral beliefs,” and “back in the day, they used to believe that if someone [died] and you touched the dead person, then Gauna [would] come back and take your soul.” While seeking inspiration in the old, the band created their album – Gauna – “on a 7-inch vinyl,” which was later “distributed by Legion of Death Records in France." This made them the first African, metal band to take this retro approach.
Their creative deliberations did not end there. Lead singer Giuseppe is white – a racial distinction from their bandmates, towards which they remain cognizant. Rather than down-play or evade the difference, they have used it as a means of sociocultural unification, and empowerment. In a recent interview, they expressed that “the metal nation knows no racial boundaries. We're all one. We all speak one common language, and it's called heavy metal." Thus, despite their deep-seated, cultural inspirations, Botswana metalheads fearlessly retain their dedication to the universality of metal – as a “language” of aggression and truth, that bears no geographical constraints. As Giuseppe expressed, "metal is music about power, independence, and freedom. That's what [I] believe in…standing up for what you believe and showing individuality,” despite the voices of opposition from above.

The Narendra Modi government has asked the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) to vacate the government bungalow housing its office in the heart of the Capital, in a sign of its toughening stand towards the UN mission.

The Indian Express has learnt that South Block has asked the UNMOGIP to vacate the bungalow — 1AB, Purana Qila Road — which has been serving as its office for the last four decades. The government accommodation — a Type VII bungalow, about 7,000 square feet — was allotted to the UN mission “free of charge”.
Sources said in its recent communication to the UN, the government has conveyed that the UNMOGIP's role has been overtaken by the Simla Agreement and the consequent establishment of the Line of Control. New Delhi is of the view that the UNMOGIP has “no relevance or role to play whatsoever”.
The UNMOGIP, established under a UN Security Council Resolution, was meant to supervise the ceasefire line established under the Karachi Agreement of July 1949.
The government's decision is being seen as a move to convey Delhi's desire to not engage with the UN mission in Delhi. “They should stay in Srinagar and do what they want. In case they want to be stationed in Delhi, they should hire premises in a private property and not occupy the government accommodation,” said a senior official requesting anonymity.
When contacted, UNMOGIP's Military Information Officer Major Tomas Malm, who is based in Srinagar, confirmed that the government has asked them to vacate the premises. “UNMOGIP's response is to relocate to another location in Delhi,” they said. Asked if they have been told the reason for this directive, they said, “The Indian authorities' reason is unknown to UNMOGIP.”
Asked if the move reflected New Delhi's stand towards UNMOGIP, they said, “You have to ask the Indian government regarding their attitude towards us”.
According to a source familiar with the arrangement between South Block and UNMOGIP, the bunglow “was allotted to the UNMOGIP as part of a gentleman's agreement between Indian officials and the UN mission over 40 years ago. It was meant to be a short-term arrangement, and the UNMOGIP officials were supposed to move to a private hired accommodation. But that never happened.”

Even as South Block officials are yet to get the property vacated, the Ministry of External Affairs' finance department has told them that it will not be able to provide budgetary support for such “goodwill gestures”.

When the new, if unelected, prime minster Theresa May stood outside Downing Street in July and announced their commitment to fighting injustice and standing up to the privileged few I cannot have been the only Labour Party member to think – “she's stealing our words if not our values”.
And when they announced the creation of a new government department entitled Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy it was clear they were seeking to park Tory tanks on Labour turf.
Under David Cameron's the term “industrial strategy” was banned and Sajid Javid, then the business secretary, regarded it as something akin to a swear word. David, Sajid and George Osborne were all about reducing the size of the state, cutting, deregulating, freeing up the private sector to express its natural exuberance and create jobs and wealth for the nation.
That went well didn't it?
With May championing industrial strategy I thought we might at last have a plan and a long term vision for our industrial future.
Six months later and what have we got? Nothing. A repeatedly promised green paper has repeatedly been delayed.
It's clear that May's words were just positioning, an attempt to duck responsibility for the real underlying causes of the anger so many feels.
Ten years without a pay rise – for those in work.
The explosion of zero hour contracts and the disappearance of job security.
A programme of austerity built on the backs of the poor whilst the banks got a bailout.
Public services cut as Government withdrew from funding local authorities.
Increasing inequality and decreasing opportunity.
These are the failures of the coalition and the Tory government, who used the financial crisis to reduce the protection and opportunity the state could offer.
Of course the Tories are finding it difficult to even begin to imagine how an invigorated, entrepreneurial state could work to help create jobs, investment, skills, security and prosperity for all.
Even if their intellectual resources were not entirely focused on bickering and Brexit, the Tories could not begin to scope out the policies possible when you have a clear and positive vision of the kind of economy we want. High-waged, high-skilled, inclusive, where people and businesses have the certainty to plan for a more prosperous future.
That is what an industrial strategy is about – building the economy we want.
And that's why we're launching our consultation on industrial strategy today. Instead of the Tories placing their tanks on our turf, Labour is taking up the role of the government to provide inspiration, vision, direction and investment certainty. The Tories are too ideologically rigid to envision an industrial strategy that addresses the challenges we face now and those of the future – climate change, automation, an ageing population – in a positive and inclusive way.
These great challenges can also be great opportunities, but only if respond to them in the right way. That is why our industrial strategy will be challenge led – tackling these challenges through collective action and innovation rather than a desperate race to the bottom.
Our industrial strategy will also be mission-oriented because it will respond to the challenges of our time through specific, measurable and time-limited missions. Without concrete, measurable missions, industrial strategy can become a bucket for every policy hole and a vague answer to every pressing problem. Our missions will excite both public and private actors, drawing in (“crowding in”) business investment, as well as talent in public organisations. And, because they will be far-reaching, our missions will bring together shadow teams from across the party to shape and deliver our missions.
It will be values driven because the choice of missions and their implementation will reflect our values as a Labour movement.
That's why today we're inviting contributions to our wide-ranging consultation that will inform the challenges, missions and values of our industrial strategy as well as the way in which it should be implemented.
The labour movement was forged in the first industrial revolution and the struggle for workers to receive a fair share of the rewards of their hard work and technological change. With your help, Labour's industrial strategy can ensure the opportunities of the new industrial revolutions are available to everyone, not just a privileged few.

BEIJING • A record six million Chinese are expected to travel abroad during the upcoming Chinese New Year season, with Singapore among the top destinations, the Global Times reported yesterday.
The holidays from Jan 27 to Feb 2 will be "a global Golden Week", the newspaper said, citing a report released by online travel agency Ctrip on Tuesday.
Nine out of the 10 most popular destinations are in Asia, with Thailand and Japan topping the list. Singapore comes in fourth behind the United States, the only Western country on the list.
South Korea slipped from third place last year to seventh place this time, as political turmoil surrounding President Park Geun Hye and the deployment of an anti-missile system in Seoul have dampened Chinese tourists' interest, the Global Times said.
However, more Chinese tourists are headed for South-east Asian countries, especially the Philippines, Vietnam and Cambodia, driven by low costs and proximity, according to Mr Zhang Lingyun, director of the Tourism Development Academy at Beijing Union University.
DOMESTIC TRAVEL
356m The record number of trips expected to be made via China's railways between Jan 13 and Feb 21. 9.7% The expected year-on-year increase in railway trips.
The report said easier visa applications, more flights and lower prices have also contributed to the surge in outbound tourism.
"After the US, Canada and Singapore granted 10-year visas to Chinese (tourists), Israel and Australia followed suit. In addition, Thailand reduced its visa fees for Chinese visitors in December, January and February," a travel agent, identified only as Chen, at domestic online travel agency Lumama.com, told the Global Times.
China aims to boost travel consumption to 7 trillion yuan (S$1.45 trillion) by 2020, contributing more than 10 per cent to national economic growth, according to a joint statement on Wednesday by the National Development and Reform Commission and National Tourism Administration.
Domestically, China's railway system will also see a record number of passengers during CNY, Xinhua news agency reported. Up to 356 million trips are expected to be made via railways between Jan 13 and Feb 21 in the annual migration, up 9.7 per cent year on year, according to the China Railway Corporation.
It said it will add more passenger trains to deal with the extra numbers and simplify ticket purchase procedures to improve services, Xinhua reported.
China expects its rapidly developing high-speed railways to help ease the strain for travellers. The country boasts a high-speed rail network of more than 20,000km, the world's largest.
A company has successfully flown a mind controlled drone, a step that its scientists say will lead to passenger carrying airplanes steered only by pilots' brains.
In a rather stunning demonstration yesterday, Portuguese business Tekever fitted a special cap to a pilot to measure their brain activity, allowing them to steer a drone through a mission in the sky using their thoughts alone.
The company's eventual target for the drone technology is applying it to pilots flying private and commercial aircraft using their minds alone, but it acknowledges there is a lot of work ahead.
For yesterday's test demonstration, in order to steer the drone, pilot Nuno Loureiro focused entirely on simple thoughts within set formats, which they learned during extensive training. This means the drone received clear signals, from their brain waves, that it could process quickly.
"This is an amazing, high-risk and high-payoff project,” Tekever chief operating officer Ricardo Mendes said at the launch. The project needs extensive further technology development, they explained, but added that it "represents the beginning of a tremendous step change in the aviation field, empowering pilots and de-risking missions".
Key benefits include allowing pilots to focus on the many advanced in-air processes while more simply controlling an aircraft, which the company describes as being akin to how professional sportspeople need to focus on tactical aspects of movement without worrying about maintaining basic game skills.
The system works by a pilot wearing a special cap that can measure their or their brain waves, and it is programmed with highly complex algorithms to counteract any confused or unhelpful thoughts from the pilot that could cause a crash. Tekever is conducting the project with technology research center the Champalimaud Foundation and software business Eagle Science, in collaboration with the Technical University of Munich, Germany.
[See the drone in action in this BBC video ]
Tekever is convinced the technology will eventually lead to manned commercial aircraft being flown simply by pilots' thoughts, and even suggests the system could allow people to drive cars the same way. It believes the technology can also be used in advanced prosthetic limbs, allowing people with severe disabilities to move with their thoughts.
The system has already been tested in a four seat, twin engine, propeller driven airplane simulator, and the company will work on running it in the real thing.
The technology will need extensive development before it is safe enough in such circumstances, and regulators would be unlikely to allow it unless proven to be extremely safe. But the concept is feasible, and perhaps even likely in the long run.
Lucknow, November 29: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad are organising a large public gathering at the disputed “Ramjanmabhoomi and Babri Masjid site”, on December 6, marking the Babri masjid demolition anniversary and attempting to build Ram Mandir. The politics of ashes is all-time high in the region as after the death of VHP leader Ashok Singhal, more than 300 VHP activists arrived in Ayodhya and took oath to construct Ram Mandir on the disputed site, report suggest.
The ashes were carried in an urn out by 300 VHP and BJP activists who arrived at Ayodhya in four buses. The ashes were immersed in Saryu river which witnessed crowd of more than 4,000 people after which a formal oath taking ceremony took place.

The case of disputed site is before the Supreme Court and after the move Muslim litigators criticised the right-wing Hindu group.
Hashim Ansari, the oldest surviving plaintiff in the case was quoted in Telegraph Calcutta in which they said, “Let the dead rest if you want to pay an honest tribute to Singhal. We have seen them doing politics on Ramjanmabhoomi, but the politics of ashes is disgusting and dangerous”.
Ansari further added, “They are politicising their urn to emotionally exploit Hindus.”
According to Zafaryab Jilani, additional advocate-general with the UP government and a member of the AIMPLB, the VHP was looking to polarise the state ahead of the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls.
After the VHP leaders death, 51 asthi-kalash yatras was carried out by the VHP activists from their home-town Allahabad, to be immersed in 50 different rivers across India, as per their last wish.
December 6 marks the 23rd anniversary of demolition of the Babri Masjid on which the VHP leaders had planned to pay a bigger tribute to Singhal, reports Telegraph.
Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, head of ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, said to Telegraph, “People from across the country will gather at Kar Sewakpuram on December 6 and chalk out the strategy to construct a Ram temple”.
They further said, “There should be no more posponement of realising Singhal's dream of a splendid Ram temple in Ayodhya”.
Among Muslims December 6, is considered as a yaum-e-ghum (mourning day) whereas among VHP activists the days is celebrated as shaurya diwas (bravery day). Meanwhile there is an alert in the region.

Editor's note: Below is Thomas Joscelyn's testimony to the House Committee on Homeland Security, on al Qaeda in Syria and the threat it poses to the US. Al Qaeda affiliates and allied jihadist groups dominate the insurgency in the heart of the Middle East.
Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson and members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the potential threats to the U.S. emanating out of Syria. Obviously, the situation inside Syria is grim, with a despicable tyrant on one side and a rebellion compromised by al Qaeda and like-minded extremists on the other. In between these two poles are the people who originally rose up against tyranny in search of a better life. As we've seen time and again in this long war, Muslims embroiled in violence in faraway lands are often the first line of defense against an ideology and an organization that pose a direct threat to the West. There are many Syrian families who deserve the free world's support today, beyond the prospect of limited airstrikes.
We should have no illusions about the nature of the Syrian war. What we are witnessing right now is a conflict that will have ramifications for our security in the West. The fighting in Syria and the terrorist campaign in Iraq are deeply linked, feeding off of one another in a way that increases the violence in both countries and potentially throughout the region. American interests outside of Syria have already been threatened by the war. We saw this late last year when al Qaeda repurposed a cell of Jordanian citizens who had fought in Syria for an attack inside their home country. They reportedly had the U.S. Embassy in their crosshairs and were planning a complex assault that involved other targets as well.
In my testimony today, I focus on the threat posed by al Qaeda and allied groups inside Syria, recognizing that al Qaeda did not start the Syrian rebellion. Moreover, there are many groups fighting on the side of the rebellion, making any clear-eyed analysis difficult. However, we can distill a number of observations.
Al Qaeda and its extremist allies have grown much stronger since late 2011. Al Qaeda does not control the entire rebellion, which is made up of a complex set of actors and alliances. However, al Qaeda and its allies dominate a large portion of northern Syria and play a key role in the fighting throughout the rest of the country. These same al Qaeda-affiliated forces have fought alongside Free Syrian Army brigades. There is no clear geographic dividing line between the most extreme fighters and other rebels. For example, al Qaeda's affiliates played a key role in the fighting in Latakia, an Assad stronghold on the coast, in early August. And within the past week we saw al Qaeda-affiliated fighters lead an attack in Malula, a Christian village not far from Damascus. These are just two examples chosen from many.
Al Qaeda has made the fight for Syria a strategic priority. Ayman al Zawahiri, al Qaeda's emir, has repeatedly called on jihadists to concentrate their efforts on the fight against the Assad regime. But al Qaeda desires much more than Assad's defeat. Al Qaeda wants to control territory and rule over others. This is consistent with al Qaeda's desire to establish an Islamic Emirate in the heart of the Levant. In their book, Knights Under the Prophet's Banner, Zawahiri discussed at length the importance of creating such a state. Al Qaeda and associated groups have consistently pursued this goal in jihadist hotspots around the globe and this is especially true in Syria today.
Two known al Qaeda affiliates operate inside Syria: Jabhat al Nusrah [Al Nusrah Front] and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Sham (or Levant). The leaders of both groups have sworn an oath of loyalty (bayat) to Ayman al Zawahiri and al Qaeda's senior leadership. The heads of these two affiliates openly bickered over the chain-of-command in early April 2013. This forced Zawahiri to intervene, but the head of the ISIS initially rejected Zawahiri's decision to have the two remain independently-operated franchises. It appears that some sort of compromise has been brokered, however, as the two al Qaeda affiliates fight alongside one another against their common enemies, including Kurdish forces in the north.
Al Qaeda is not just a terrorist organization. Al Qaeda's leaders are political revolutionaries seeking to acquire power for themselves and their ideology in several countries. They have a plan for Syria. Al Qaeda's affiliates inside Syria are not just fighting Assad's forces, or committing various other acts of terror. They are seeking to inculcate their ideology within the Syrian population. Many Syrians have no love for al Qaeda's ideology, or its harsh brand of sharia law. But al Qaeda knows this and has adjusted its tactics accordingly. Jabhat al Nusrah and the ISIS are providing local governance in the areas they control, and are seeking to win hearts and minds by making various social services available to the population. This is a continuation of a trend that we've seen elsewhere, beginning in Yemen, where al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula launched Ansar al Sharia as its political face. Ansar al Sharia does more than fight al Qaeda's enemies. It has provided food, electricity, medical care, and various other necessities to Yemenis. Al Qaeda's affiliates in Syria have copied this strategy in Syria, and are increasing their popular support in some areas (especially in the north and east) in this manner. This model is being implemented in Raqqah, Aleppo, Deir al Zor.
Syria has become the central front in the global jihad. Other al Qaeda-linked groups have joined the fight in Syria, thereby strengthening al Qaeda's hand. Groups including the Pakistani Taliban (Tekrik-e Taliban) and the Muhajireen (Migrants) Brigade are fighting in Syria. The first group sent fighters and trainers from South Asia to Syria, while the second is comprised of Chechens and other foreign fighters. Indeed, several thousand foreign fighters from around the globe have joined the fight. Countries throughout North Africa and the Middle East have supplied a large number of jihadist recruits. In addition, a significant number of Europeans have traveled to Syria for jihad.
Some of the more powerful Syrian rebel groups are closely allied with al Qaeda's affiliates. Ahrar al Sham and its coalition of like-minded groups, the Syrian Islamic Front (SIF), fight alongside al Qaeda's fighters regularly. Brigades belonging to another Islamist coalition, the Syrian Islamic Liberation Front (SILF), have coordinated their operations with al Qaeda's affiliates and Ahrar al Sham in key battles as well. For example, fighters from Nusrah, the SIF, and the SILF overran the Taftanaz Airbase in January. The collective strength of these groups is easily in the tens of thousands of fighters nationwide.
As the 9/11 Commission recognized, there is a direct connection between terrorism “over there” and the terrorist threat to Americans “over here.” Most of al Qaeda's assets are devoted to acquiring power in North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. However, some portion of their assets is always devoted to terrorist plots against the West. Before the 9/11 attacks, most al Qaeda recruits were trained to fight alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan or as part of insurgencies elsewhere. Only a small number of al Qaeda members were selected to take part in international operations. Since 9/11, al Qaeda has greatly expanded its overall footprint by directing or supporting various insurgencies. This increases al Qaeda's potential recruits, with a small percentage of them being repurposed for operations against the West. We have seen this in Yemen, for example, where al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula simultaneously increased its capacity to wage an insurgency against the government, while also increasing its ability to launch attacks on the U.S. homeland. Al Qaeda's Iraqi affiliate, which spawned the Al Nusrah Front, has dedicated a small part of its resources to attacking the West as well. The Department of Homeland of Security announced in 2004 that al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) was ordered by Osama bin Laden to assemble a cell capable of attacking the U.S. In 2007, failed attacks in London and Glasgow were tied back to AQI. It should be noted that during this same time-period AQI was mainly focused on winning territory, not attacking the West.
Al Qaeda has talent inside Syria today, including top operatives who currently pose a threat to the West. According to credible press reports, a top al Qaeda terrorist named Mustafa Setmariam Nasar (a.k.a. Abu Musab al Suri) was freed from prison in the wake of the rebellion. Nasar has been tied to al Qaeda's terrorist plotting inside Europe, including the networks that executed the 2004 Madrid train bombings and the 2005 attacks in London. Nasar played a prominent role in al Qaeda's operations prior to being detained in 2005 and transferred to Syrian custody. Nasar is a widely influential jihadist thinker and a key advocate of small-scale terrorist attacks inside the West. They were reportedly freed by the Assad regime in the wake of the current rebellion. One of Nasar's closest colleagues, known as Abu Khalid al Suri, was appointed by Zawahiri to a key position within the region. We should wonder what happened to Mohammed Zammar, an al Qaeda recruiter who helped convince the 9/11 Hamburg cell to travel to Afghanistan for training. Zammar was once imprisoned by the Assad regime and may very well be free today. In addition to this “old school” talent, al Qaeda has been recruiting Westerners who could be used in attacks against their home countries or elsewhere in the West. In recent months, European officials have openly worried about this possibility.
Al Qaeda's affiliates are seeking possession of chemical and biological weapons in Syria. On May 30, the Turkish press reported that an al Nusrah Front cell had been arrested and was found to be in possession of about two kilos of sarin gas. The following day, June 1, Iraqi officials announced that they had broken up an al Qaeda cell that was seeking to launch sarin nerve gas attacks in Iraq, Europe and possibly North America. If the Iraqi government's claims are accurate, then we already have evidence that al Qaeda's affiliates in Iraq and Syria intend to use chemical weapons in an attack the West. I encourage the Homeland Security Committee to investigate these claims and ascertain for itself the extent of al Qaeda's efforts in this regard.

Sometimes you want your players to feel like something dangerous is going on, but in reality its just a mundane occurrence. I've put together a table of 100 spooky and unnerving, yet harmless encounters for you to frighten and confuse your players! Roll a d100 on the table below to get started.
ON THE face of things, it is surprising that Tunisia's first president chosen in an open, democratic election is an 88-year-old former minister, Beji Caid Sebsi. Four years ago stone-throwing youths took to the streets, instigating an uprising that overthrew Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, the autocrat who had reigned for the previous 23 years. After their fall the first elections were easily won by Islamists who had previously been banned. Now, by contrast, Tunisia will be presided over by a veteran who served as interior minister in Habib Bourguiba's government in the 1960s. In a run-off on December 21st they got 56% of the votes cast, comfortably defeating Moncef Marzouki, a former human-rights campaigner who had spent years in exile.
Mr Caid Sebsi portrayed themselves as an admirer of Bourguiba, who ruled the country for 30 years after independence from France in 1956. But they played down their role as interior minister at a time of repression, instead stressing their record as a conciliatory interim prime minister for ten months immediately after the revolution of 2011.

Mr Marzouki's appeal to voters was that they would defend their newly won liberties. This attracted Islamist sympathisers, especially supporters of Nahda (“Awakening”), the Islamist party that had led a governing coalition in the outgoing constituent assembly but which chose not to put up a candidate. A swathe of other Tunisians with grim memories of life under Mr Ben Ali also backed Mr Marzouki, who had served as interim president for the past three years. But for other voters, Mr Caid Sebsi's Nidaa Tounes (“Tunisian Call”) party smacks of the old regime under a new guise. The result also exposed the gulf between the poor south and the richer north. In the five southernmost regions, 80% of voters plumped for Mr Marzouki.
When a Nidaa Tounes spokesperson claimed victory on the evening of polling day, as votes were still being counted, Mr Marzouki's supporters protested near the southern port of Gabes. An Islamist news website then claimed there had been massive fraud. Protests spread to a handful of southern towns and a suburb of Tunis. Some local government offices and police stations were torched, recalling the revolt against Mr Ben Ali. Mr Marzouki eventually said they would not challenge the result. Their advisers seem to have decided that if fraud did take place, it was not on a scale that would have altered the outcome.
Parliament and president are, for the moment, in tune. After a general election in October, Nidaa Tounes became the largest party in parliament. It is a melting pot of former members of Mr Ben Ali's old ruling party with non-aligned figures who want to salvage what they regard as the better aspects of the Bourguiba era: efficiency and secular values.
Nidaa Tounes is expected to form a coalition government. Mr Caid Sebsi is to resign as party leader and is thought to favour a non-party prime minister. Their party's claim to defend liberty and openness will soon be tested, as a “truth and dignity commission” starts looking into past human-rights abuses. A few days before Mr Caid Sebsi was to be sworn in some commission members arrived to fetch documents from the presidential archive. They were blocked by guards.
A handful of the world's top programmers said they support the pay-TV industry's "Ditch the Box" proposal for opening up set-top boxes – however they urged the FCC to ensure that their own apps on a set-top box be given "parity" with pay-TV providers' apps.
"The MVPD apps plan [dubbed "Ditch the Box"] offers a constructive foundation for providing consumers with an alternative to leasing set-top boxes, subject to certain additional protections for programmers and the clarification of particular details," wrote executives from Time Warner, 21st Century Fox, Viacom, CBS and Scripps Networks Interactive in a filing with the FCC. "Any final rules must ensure parity for programmer apps and provide program networks with enforceable contractual rights against competitive device manufacturers and MVPDs. The companies stated that they look forward to working closely with the Commission and MVPDs as the proceeding moves forward."
The executives from the programmers met with FCC officials last week to discuss the set-top box issue, which has blossomed into a major topic for the pay-TV industry.
FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler kickstarted the issue earlier this year with their "Unlock the Box" proposal, which seeks to force pay-TV operators to open their set-top boxes to services from other providers. The pay-TV industry balked at the proposal, and last month pitched the FCC with an open, apps-based alternative to the agency's set-top proposal they dubbed "Ditch the Box." The scheme would require major pay-TV operators to enable their services through apps based on open HTML5 standards, allowing customers to access their TV service through a range of third-party devices.
And it appears pay-TV's "Ditch the Box" proposal is gaining steam, with a range of players including Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel voicing concerns with Wheeler's initial "Unlock the Box" pitch.
However, some continue to voice concerns about the "Ditch the Box" proposal. In a separate FCC filing, the Consumer Video Choice Coalition said that the pay-TV industry's "Ditch the Box" proposal "constructively demonstrates that the Commission's proposed timeline for expecting major MVPDs to achieve IP-based delivery through open and interoperable standards is feasible." However, the group – which includes executives from Public Knowledge, TiVo and other companies – raised a number of concerns including what kinds of programming would be allowed, exactly how the apps-based system would work, and how such apps might be licensed.
However, the Consumer Video Choice Coalition noted that the various set-top proposals could well pave the way for a possible solution that would meet the FCC's goals of opening the set-top box industry.

Hi guys,
In this weeks post I'll be showing you guys how to make a speed controlled fan using an arduino. we shall use a pc case fan and control its speed by turning the knob of a potentiometer.
Let us begin
You will require the following parts:
Arduino Uno
a potentiometer
a PC case fan
wires
breadboard
PWM and the Arduino
PWM stands for pulse width modulation. if you do not know what pulse width modulation is you can find out more at this link. The arduino has only a few pins that can be used to send PWM signals. these pins can be identified with a ‘~' symbol next to its no. See the pic below.
As you can see from the arduino Uno has 6 pins capable of PWM output. The arduino can send PWM values with a scale of 0-255. For more details check the program in the last section.
On the other end of the board we have the analog input of the arduino.
These 6 pins on the arduino allow us to connect analog sensors to them. the output recieved from these pins will be scaled from a number ranging from 0-1023.
The Fan and the potentiometer
The fan I am using is an old motherboard fan. some motherboard fans have three pins and some have four pin connectors. This fan is the four pin version. You can find more details regarding the pinouts here. This fan requires a 12V input but works pretty well with the 5V output of the arduino. Also we shall not be connecting ‘Sense‘ pin i.e. pin 3. check circuit diagram in the last section.
If you don't know what the component in the above picture is it is a potentiometer . How it works is this. Connect it properly as the shown in fig. If you rotate the knob You will get an input signal proportional to the amount of rotation.
The final part
Connect the parts as per the circuit diagram.
You will need to upload the following program to the arduino
int fan = 9; //fan is connected to pin 9 of the arduino void setup() { // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second: Serial.begin(9600); pinMode(fan, OUTPUT); //define pinmode for pin 9. i.e.INPUT/OUTPUT } void loop() { // read the input on analog pin 0: int pot = analogRead(A0); //pot reads analog input A0 value int fan_speed = pot * (255 / 1023.0); //this scales the value between 0-255 analogWrite(fan,fan_speed); //this sends pwm pulse to pin 9 of fan_speed no Serial.println(fan_speed); //this prints fanspeed value in serial delay(10); // delay of 10 to provide stability }
Now rotate the knob of the potentiometer. You should be able to control the speed of the fan through it
If you open up the serial port on the arduino IDE you can see the values of PWM output ranging from 0-255
That's it for this week, Please like, comment and subscribe . Ill see you guys next week with another project.

ukuleles
In order to avoid the long wait lists I've had in the past I am only accepting a couple of selected orders at a time. These slots fill quickly so contact me to see if I have room for you.
Occasionally I will build instruments that are not pre sold and I will post them here.
Enjoy the pictures you'll find here on these pages but please do not copy any of my designs or images in any manner without my permission. Mahalo!
The following uke is available as of 3/23/17.
All other ukes on this page have been sold.
Prices & Availability
I operate a small one-man shop in rural Hawaii, run entirely on solar electricity. It's not always fun or easy but it's the only option I have given my remote location. I make all of the wood elements that go into my ukuleles and every step of every process is done by my hands alone. I have no apprentices nor do I farm out any of my work, a practice that is so common in many luthier shops today.
Because of the diversity of my work, it is difficult to quote exact prices. I can have as few as 40 hours or more than 150 hours into each uke I build (the average is 60 hours.) Rather than trying to provide you with a Chinese take-out menu of options I will attempt to simplify things with this rough guideline. I no longer have a standard (NSB) model; each uke is unique as I combine different elements suited for that particular instrument.
Base prices for my ukuleles are as follows: Tenor: $4400, Concert: $4200, Soprano: $3500. That's where we start. The base price includes bindings & purflings on body, neck and headstock, rosette, bound sound holes, bone nut & saddle, bound side sound port, choice of premium tuners, glossy nitro cellulose finish and hard shell case. Popular options are slotted headstock ($200), arm bevels ($500), cutaways ($300), paua abalone purflings ($300), pickups ($200) and inlays. Premium wood upgrades are also available, ranging from $100 to $300 when available. Inlays and other decorative elements can be as time consuming (or more) than building the uke itself and can drive prices over $10,000.
At the current time I am not accepting any new custom orders as I focus on expressing some of my own ideas with my work. These and other non-commissioned ukes will be posted here when they become available.
Here are some pictures of this year's People's Choice Award and Artisan's Choice Award winning ukulele presented at the 4th annual Big Island Guild Ukulele show in Kainaliu, Hawaii.
4-String Tenor Ukulele
"The Three Mermaids"
This all koa ukulele was challenging yet immensely satisfying to build. Living so close to nature in this beautiful Hawaiian environment was naturally very influential in my choice of whimsical designs depicting two mermaids frolicking in the sea and one dreamingly relaxing in a banana moon. I use AAA Big Island curly koa for the body and ebony elsewhere including the fretboard and headstock veneer. Paua abalone is use unashamedly throughout, adorning the entire front and back of the instrument. The seahorse on the end graft was an afterthought that occurred to me only after I sprayed the first couple of coats of lacquer. The mermaids are made up of composite stone and 10,000 year old fossil mammoth ivory. After the ukulele was finish sanded, I scrimshawed the details in the bodies, remembering the art form I was involved in years ago. Other inlay materials include gold mother of pearl, abalone shell and fossil walrus ivory.
This instrument is sold.

Matt Dahlberg's NSB Tenor Ukulele
with AAAA koa upgrade, side sound port and MiSi pickup installed. SOLD
Honu Tenor with Side Sound Port
With just one look there is no mistaking that this is a Hawaiian ukulele! It was especially fun for me to incorporate the "honu"inlay on the "tapa" inspired background, both of which are significant in Pacific Island cultures. The fine red & black prufling nicely contrasts with the curly koa binding that I've used throught the uke. The side sound port acts as a personal monitor allowing for a bit more player feedback. The Spanish cedar neck is reinforced with a carbon fiber rod for added stability and better tonal response.
This is a well balanced instrument that has great volume and is an easy, comfortable player.
Comes with hard shell case. Shipping with the USA only.

This fantasy uke was inspired by the pond we have next to the shop. It's filled with white and pink lotus blossoms and attracts a lot of dragonflies. I only ever seem to get a fleeting glimpse of the fairies, so that depiction is largely from my imagination. This particular fairy was made of 40,000 year old mastodon ivory in which I've scrimshawed the details. This is truly a magical ukulele with an exceptional sound.
This uke is currently available through Hawaii Music Supply. Please contact them for purchasing details.
Sorry, this uke is SOLD

Skull Island
Black Orchid Tenor
Tenor in Black & White
This uke is a bit of a departure for me, combining Macassar ebony with bearclaw spruce. While you might agree that it's gorgeous to look at, what really surprised me was the tone. It's bright and punchy yet full at the same time. The wild orchid inlays, even though they are different colors, were made from the same piece of fossil mammoth ivory (40,000 years old.) The curly koa accents add to the stunning statement that this uke is, both as an excellent player and object d'art.
This ukulele is SOLD.
Waterfall Spruce and Koa Slotted Tenor #1706
For the first time I've combined koa with and exceptional "waterfall spruce" top. This unique spruce comes from British Columbia and it excells in it's sonic properties. Combined with this particularly dense ands hard koa it is brilliant and punchy with great volume. This ukulele features a couple of my best selling options, a slotted head stock and side sound port. As of earlier last year all of my ukes also have a wider lower bout, string-through bridge and improved bracing. I've used Gotoh Stealth tuners which keeps the head stock light and lower in profile. Strung low G with wound basses. Hard shell case in included. Shipping (+$175) within the USA only.

Tenor Uke #1602
Teen Mom 2‘s Kailyn Lowry gave birth to their third child with their third baby daddy early last month, but they hadn't revealed the child's name until what some fans thought was today. The reality TV star stated that they had a hard time coming up with a real name for the child, which they dubbed “Baby Lo” before their delivery and for five weeks after their birth because none of the names they had been interested in seemed to suit him.
Unfortunately for fans, Kailyn Lowry still hasn't named their child, though a hoax circulated through the internet Wednesday that they had given them the moniker Murphy Nixon. Fans were not necessarily surprised by the news, especially since they had included both names on a Twitter poll when trying to decide what to name him. Although many believed the hoax, it turns out it was just that. Rumors have also swirled that Kail has named them St. Thomas, but thus far, the young mother has not yet revealed Baby Lo's name.
It is unclear if Baby Lo actually has a name and they are keeping it private, or if they are still having trouble deciding.
Baby Lo came into the world surrounded by a whirlwind of controversy. Kail announced they were pregnant with them only a few months after their divorce from their ex-husband, Javi Marroquin. What was even more shocking to fans was the fact that Javi was not the father, especially since Kailyn Lowry had been adamant about not wanting more children.

Kailyn Lowry and Javi Marroquin's marriage breakdown will play out in Marriage Bootcamp: Reality Stars Edition, which will premiere in October; about a year after it was originally filmed. In the television show, the pair gets deep when it comes to the issues in their relationship, including the fact that Javi didn't want to accept their divorce.
Javi Marroquin has been very vocal about the fact that although they accepted Kail's older son from a previous relationship, Isaac, they had no interest in having any sort of relationship with Baby Lo.
Baby Lo's father, Chris Lopez, had their identity kept secret from the press for a long time because Kailyn Lowry wasn't sure how involved they would be in their child's life. Kail and Chris only dated briefly before they became pregnant, and the mom-of-three was worried they wouldn't be there for their son at all. But despite rumors, they did come through and attend Baby Lo's birth.

If Anyone Had Hopes That Maybe, Just Maybe, McCrory Was Gaining Insight, Read This
Governor Pat McCrory within one hour or two hours of announcing their executive order that does little to actually fix or repeal HB2 took time to retweet several people and groups who embraced their actions.
The first was the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce's attempt to whitewash the news:
The second was that of NC GOP Senate Majority Leader Phil Berger (photo) - a vile, caustic, hate-filled and ugly statement supporting the Governor's executive order:
Here's the text of the first paragraph:
"Gov. McCrory just put to rest the left's lies about HB 2 and proved it allows private and public employers, non-profits and churches the ability to adopt nondiscrimination policies that are stronger than state and federal law. But that fact is irrelevant to Roy Cooper and their left-wing political correctness mob with their agenda-driven allies in the liberal media, who will never stop trashing North Carolina until they achieve their goal of allowing any man into any women's bathroom or locker room at any time simply by claiming to feel like a woman."
Really heartwarming, isn't it? I'm sure North Carolina's LGBT community, equality supporters, and rational citizens felt much better knowing the most powerful lawmaker in the state is a radical extremist who clearly hates anyone who isn't a Republican, anyone who has common sense, or anyone who believes elected officials should treat the people who pay their salaries with a modicum of respect.

DIVOCK Origi has admitted they will have to remain patient to get their chance in the team, amid rumours linking them with a move to Juventus.
The Belgian scored 10 goals in all competitions last season, but is yet to start a league game this campaign, with the likes of Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Philippe Coutinho all in good form — and Daniel Sturridge even having to settle for a spot on the bench.
Origi, currently away on international duty with the Belgian national team, dismissed the rumours insisting they are focusing on forcing their way into Jürgen Klopp's plans.
“I've not heard it. It's a rumour, as there are many,” they told HLN.
“No, I concentrate fully on Liverpool and the Belgium national team.”
The 21-year-old has scored in both games they have started, against Derby County and Burton Albion in the League Cup, but insists they understand how fierce the competition is for starting spots with the team's current good form.
“I've started both matches of the League Cup, and I scored in both games Liverpool have won almost every game,” they added.
Origi claims Klopp has told them they will have to remain patient to get their chance in the team, as anything can happen, displayed by their rise to first team prominence late last season.
“A manager never changes their winning team. It does not matter to me. Klopp believes in me and says I have to be patient.
“He asked me to stay calm, which is not easy for a footballer. I want to play and be the decisive player that I was last season.
“I scored 10 goals in no time [so] everything can turn quickly in football.”

Marois: It's not a priority for me to break up the country…right now.
So Pauline Marois wants to focus on issues other than a referendum on breaking up Canada.
“It's not a priority for Quebecers at the moment and it's not my priority either. Our priority is to reinforce Quebec, reinforce it in all areas, reinforce the economy and adopt a charter.” -Pauline Marois
“At the moment” … so it's on the table then.
Therefore, it's a valid thing for people to be obsessed with. It's not a small thing. It's not something you can just try out when you feel the time is right. It's about the fundamental nature of our country, all 10 provinces and 3 territories of it.
You are essentially saying :
‘It's not a priority for me right now to break up the country. But maybe later if I think enough people want it. Just don't worry about it, it'll be fine. I'll only try to break up the country if I think people want to.' – What Pauline Marois means to say
But. What. If. People. Don't. Want. That. At. All?
The safest, logical, course is to simply not elect you in the first place.
If you can't get elected proudly proclaiming that you want to have a referendum, then don't try to hold that possibility in reserve for later. It's called a mandate. If you think you can get a mandate for your handling of the economy and instituting a mildly racist charter that targets minority religious groups in your province in favour of the white Judeo-Christian majority…ahem…then focus on that and promise there will be no referendum before another election. Or could you not get elected if you said that either? Tricky.

Why didn't Eskimos get scurvy before citrus was introduced to their diet? They have a traditional diet of almost entirely meat and fish. Where did they get their vitamin C?
Cecil replies:
This calls to mind a question I've dealt with before: Why do the Eskimos (or Inuit, as those in Canada and Greenland generally prefer to be called) stay there? It turns out that the people of the north have a highly evolved physiology that makes them well suited to life in the arctic: a compact build that conserves warmth, a faster metabolism, optimally distributed body fat, and special modifications to the circulatory system. One marvels at the adaptability of the human organism, of course, but still one has to ask: Wouldn't it have been easier just to move to San Diego?
Much of what we know about the Eskimo diet comes from the legendary arctic anthropologist and adventurer Vilhjalmur Stefansson, who made several daredevil journeys through the region in the early 20th century. Stefansson noticed the same thing you did, that the traditional Eskimo diet consisted largely of meat and fish, with fruits, vegetables, and other carbohydrates — the usual source of vitamin C — accounting for as little as 2 percent of total calorie intake. Yet they didn't get scurvy.
Stefansson argued that the native peoples of the arctic got their vitamin C from meat that was raw or minimally cooked — cooking, it seems, destroys the vitamin. (In fact, for a long time “Eskimo” was thought to be a derisive Native American term meaning “eater of raw flesh,” although this is now discounted.) Stefansson claimed the high incidence of scurvy among European explorers could be explained by their refusal to eat like the natives. They proved this to their own satisfaction by subsisting in good health for lengthy periods — one memorable odyssey lasted for five years — strictly on whatever meat and fish they and their companions could catch.
A few holdouts didn't buy it. To settle the matter once and for all, Stefansson and a colleague lived on a meat-only diet for one year under medical supervision at New York's Bellevue Hospital, starting in February 1928. The two ate between 100 and 140 grams of protein a day, the balance of their calories coming from fat, yet they remained scurvy free. Later in life Stefansson became a strong advocate of a high-meat diet even if you didn't live in the arctic; they professed to enjoy improved health, reduced weight, etc, from meals consisting of coffee, the occasional grapefruit, and a nice steak, presumably rare. Doesn't sound half bad, and one might note that until recently the Inuit rarely suffered from atherosclerosis and other Western ailments.
Vitamin C can be found in a variety of traditional Eskimo/Inuit staples, including the skin of beluga whales (known as muktuk), which is said to contain as much vitamin C as oranges. Other reported sources include the organ meats of sea mammals as well as the stomach contents of caribou. You're thinking: It'll be a mighty cold day in the arctic before they catch me eating the stomach contents of caribou. Indeed, you have to wonder whether the Inuit really ate such stuff either, since Stefansson describes it being fed to dogs.
Other aspects of the arctic diet also remain controversial. For example, some say the Eskimos could get vitamin C from blueberries during the summer months, while others say you'd be lucky to find enough berries to cover a bowl of Rice Chex. I say let's not sweat the details of the menu, which varied from region to region anyway. We know Eskimos got enough vitamin C in their traditional diet to survive because obviously they did. Now it's academic — most arctic natives live in villages and get their vitamin C from OJ and Juicy Juice, just like you and me.
Oh, and for all you vegetarians who've seen the error of your ways and were thinking of adopting the Inuit diet — think twice about the raw meat thing. Vitamin C might not a problem, but E. coli might.
Dear Cecil:
I read in a recent magazine that the ringworm parasite cannot stand anesthesia. So if and when a victim of ringworm is put under for any medical purpose, the ringworm has been known to use any means of escape possible, and it would not be unusual to see quite large infestations evacuating through a patient's nostrils almost immediately upon anesthetizing. True? And are there any documented incidences of this? Can you find pictures?
Cecil replies:
Definitely an interesting visual, Morb. Unfortunately (for you), ringworm is a fungus, not a critter. Guess you're stuck with tapeworms, huh?

Showcased playing live on PlayStation 4 as the zinger to Ubisoft's otherwise trailer-strewn conference, The Division reinvigorates our expectations of next-gen gaming. With It's always online, post-pandemic take on New York City, it features a slew of advanced effects-work and physics that are hard to believe could be possible on current console technology. It's the technical pin-up of the moment, taking the mantle previously held by Ubisoft's own Watch Dogs (and the now sadly defunct Star Wars 1313 project) as indicators of what could be achieved with exclusive development on PS4 and Xbox One.
Swedish developer Massive Entertainment is at the heart of this operation, bringing to life this new open world RPG/shooter hybrid, as played from a third-person perspective. Given how its seven minute demo doesn't bring to bear its online features to the absolute fullest extent, the striking attention to world detail is inevitably the part that stands out most. Everything is heightened over what we've come to expect of console gaming, from the increase in particles effects spewing from Molotov explosions, to the streets littered with debris and Christmas trimmings on the blink. It's gorgeous in motion, but given Ubisoft's history in delivering major franchises to as many platforms as humanly possible raises the question: is this truly only possible on next-gen hardware?
If the description of its Snowdrop engine is to be taken at face value, The Division works with technology specifically designed with next-gen platforms in mind. It cites dynamic global illumination, procedural destruction and a broad push for greater environmental detail and effects as its major strengths - but it doesn't quite do itself justice with that list. What its lengthy slice of gameplay does show in earnest is a widening of the play-field to support an always-online universe, where draw distances for geometry and reflection mapping alike necessarily show no apparent bounds. Never has high street filled with garbage, scurrying rats and ruined yellow taxis looked so compelling for a solo adventurer - but just as with any good photo-shoot, lighting is crucial to generating that appeal.
"The Division is the next-gen technical pin-up of the moment, taking the mantle previously held by Ubisoft's own Watch Dogs and the now sadly defunct Star Wars 1313 project."
The most attention-grabbing visual highlight is revealed at the beginning, with clear plumes of steam rising from sewers grates being coloured by blinking red brake lights. Concurrent light sources stand at an unprecedented level in the trailer from the word go as well, as the camera pans from the city rooftops to the ground level of the derelict streets. Wound-up trees and canopies flicker with seasonal decorations - still electrified - and every detail on the street is caught and refracted in each puddle and glossy car exterior. Usually this is an area of compromise for PS3 and 360 sandbox big-guns like Grand Theft Auto 4, where only select parts of the world are mirrored. Seemingly, this is a luxury that can now be comfortably afforded.
Indoors, lighting comes into its own with torch-lights being directed by other squad members, plus light-shafts streaming through unbarred windows. By means of the rallying signs, maps and post-it notes, The Division's higher resolution texture-work also means we can piece together a personal narrative for how the city has dismantled up until this point. Based on our high quality direct feed of the playthrough used for this analysis, the game world is uncompromising in these micro details. The strength of the PS4 hardware being as such, adopting a smooth anisotropic approach to filtering textures is trivial to overall performance, as much as it is for the modern PC gamer.
There's certainly a repetition of some elements though; the graffiti seen on concrete road blocks is duplicated, but their irregular placement means it's not really noticeable. Shadow filtering is the only true limitation to be spotted in rendering such a vast world. On approaching Main Street there's a clear cascade running across the buildings to the right - a line that needs to be crossed before shadow detail materialises. A light flickering to character shadows is also evident as squad members walk through low-key lit indoor areas, and the jagged edges aren't too far removed from the better current-gen implementations.
There's no certainty if tessellation is factored in for geometry, but polygonal detail is very high across the board: from the corrugated cylindrical vents to crumpled boxes, sagging under their own weight. It's likely the case that these bits and pieces are instanced to spare the console repeatedly using the same vertex data. We do see common geometry for trees, but much like the textures they're positioned in ways that make this cost-saving trick harder to spot. Otherwise, incidental details like torn cloths fluttering on building-sides, floating debris and dust, and flocks of birds bring a dismal world to life in style.
"If there's one thing that makes The Division stand out as a next-gen title, it's the interplay between multiple elements such as the lighting, effects and the advanced physics."
When it comes to physics, chip damage to car windshields and concrete road-blocks at least show a gradual whittling down of cover is possible. It's also the case that damage is dependent on a bullet's specific impact point, rather than simpler approximations. This is unlike the bigger, pre-defined chunks that chip off scenery in Battlefield 3's campaign mode. Character animations are also comparable to DICE's flagship shooter, looking automated in nature as they reach to close car doors, while pressing past NYPD vehicles used for cover.
But if there's one thing that makes The Division stand out as a next-gen title, it's the interplay between all these elements: the lighting, effects and physics. When bullets are fired at billboards, for example, the game doesn't just leave behind a bump-mapped texture in its place, but instead creates holes for light-shafts to stream through. This is based on the precise point of attack. In a similar fashion, a light bar is seen dangling from a single wire during earthquakes, flickering and lighting upset dust dynamically as it swings unhinged. It's a superb atmospheric flourish on the surface, but the crucial take-away is that it's now also an interactive component of the world.
But what can be said of performance in its current state, still so far away from completion? The Division's frame-rate is a solid 30fps based on what's shown so far, with only hints of dips to 28fps during grenade explosions. There's also a faint stuttering effect as a result of irregular frame ordering - it's still 30 on average, but we can sometimes see two unique frames in a row, followed by two duplicates that can make motion feel uneven - the same artifact we saw in the PS4 Need for Speed: Rivals playthrough at the EA conference. Tearing is also present but difficult to spot, being mostly contained to the bottom 50 pixels of the buffer used during the analysis. Here, we just get the idea that the framebuffer isn't being flipped at the right point - an issue that should be easily resolved.
"The Division's frame-rate is a solid 30fps based on what's shown so far, with only hints of an impact to performance during grenade explosions."
The PlayStation 4 build of The Division shown during at Ubisoft's conference effectively gives a solid 30fps throughout. There's an occasional tear near the bottom of the screen, but it's early days for a game, given that it's scheduled for a late 2014 release.
Running at a full 60fps is still an unfulfilled dream based on the evidence here, but there's plenty of time for the game's target to change between now and its release. For those itching to see it run at 60 and beyond, the prospect of an unrestricted PC version of The Division ultimately comes down to public interest. Petitioning is recommended by Ubisoft as one way to vent your views on the matter, and sure enough, over 114,000 people are pretty keen on the idea so far. However, given Massive Entertainment's huge pedigree on PC over the last decade, plus Ubisoft's all-inclusive approach to developing on multiple platforms with franchises like Assassin's Creed, we'd dare to say that a PC release is an extreme likelihood in the long run. It's just a matter of when the announcement is dropped.
But when it comes to the core question of whether this post-apocalyptic adventure could see a PS3 or 360 release, we're talking in very different terms. The interplay between effects and physics here eclipses most games on current-gen consoles, but it's fair to say that equally complex shooters like Battlefield 3 and Crysis 3 prove that where there's a will, there's always a way. With enough aggressive nipping and tucking anything is possible for such a game - but then we must ask whether we'd still accept the end result. This is a salient issue, given how strongly The Division is being sold as Ubisoft's chiselled, gleaming mascot for next-gen potential. On the flipside, given how expensive AAA game development is, there are around 100m reasons to add current-gen versions to the roster of supported hardware.
In the build-up to this Christmas, steering clear of announcements for other platforms makes great business sense. As an incentive for buyers to make an early leap to PS4 and Xbox One, it subtracts one reason for gamers to drag their heels by buying a simplified current-gen port. We'll have to see whether Ubisoft holds strong on this front as demand for the game ebbs and flows in the coming months and just how extended the upcoming "cross-gen" era of production will be, but if nothing changes, it'll certainly be a winter 2014 to remember for Xbox One and PS4 owners.
According to reports in both of New York's tabloids today, cops have questions about the woman who accused Giants lineman Jay Bromley of attempted rape and vehicular assault, with the Post's police source saying Bromley is unlikely to be charged.
The woman told police that after they arranged a meeting on Instagram, Bromley tried to rape them after they performed oral sex on them in a Manhattan hotel room on Jan. 31, and that they hit them with their car after refusing to take them home.
Bromley's story is different:
Bromley told cops that they found the woman naked on a bed when they emerged from the bathroom after checking into the Hyatt Herald Square over the weekend, law enforcement sources said Monday. They immediately performed oral sex on him, but abruptly stopped and asked for $2,000, which Bromley refused to pay because they thought they were on a date, the sources said.

The report says police believe the woman has a history of finding athletes on celebrity and then receiving payment in exchange for sex. The Daily News reports that they attempted to extort actor Taye Diggs last year, appearing in a now-deleted Instagram video threatening to release their sex tape.
The Post's police source says Bromley likely won't be charged with assault, because surveillance video shows them jumping onto the hood of their car.

Based on the movie poster for Equilibrium, because after debating between drawing a miserable Derpy or more crossover fanart, I opted to leave Derpy be. Hopefully an upcoming episode will give me something nice to have Derpy do, like clobbering a titan or lounging with a kappa.If you want to support me, I put full sized pictures like this one up on Patreon, and now that the hiatus is over I'll probably be making two a month (time allowing) www.patreon.com/MoonlitBrush And the hiatus is finally over guys! For those who survived the long pause congrats! Undoubtedly these longer pauses result in a few people leaving, but hopefully that means the arriving talent can pick up the slack. Technically I also arrived during the hiatus, though I've been watching the show since the start.Edit: in a last ditch effort to make certain I had the right name for the episode I checked the internet again, and this time enough people have created copies of the episodes that the new name stood out more than the wiki, which had an older name for the episodes, "the cutie map"
Incredible bravery of acid attack victim as they arrive to testify against married lover who scalded them when they dumped them
Patricia Lefranc, 48, left disfigured after sulphuric acid attack
They had been mistress of married Richard Remes, 57
They 'launched assault after they ended relationship'
A mother whose face was hideously deformed by acid sprayed by their married lover appeared in court today and accused them of 'turning me into a monster'.
Speaking on the first day of Richard Remes's trial for attempted murder in Belgium, Patricia Lefranc said they were 'determined to look them in the eye and show the jury what they have done to me'.
The 48-year-old, who underwent 86 operations following the attack, added: 'I hope to convince the court that they did indeed want to murder me.'
Before and after: Patricia Lefranc was seriously disfigured in the attack allegedly carried out by their ex-lover
Richard Remes insisted that they didn't realise the sulphuric acid would have such devastating consequences
Remes, 57, is said to have planned the sulphuric acid attack after Ms Lefranc ended their relationship just over two years ago.
Ms Lefranc told Brussels Assizes that December 1, 2009 was the day Remes 'finally destroyed my life.'
They said they were waiting for them as they emerged from a lift in the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek-Saint-Jean.
They sprayed the sulphuric acid, once referred to as 'oil of vitriol' by medieval European alchemists, all over their head and upper body, they told the court.
They said they were convinced they would die, but neighbours in a nearby building heard their screams and managed to get them to the burns unit of a nearby hospital, where they lay in a coma for three months.
Ms Lefranc said: 'I hope Remes is convicted of attempted murder, and not just for assault and battery with torture. They did not just want to hurt me, they wanted me out of the way. I just hope that I get to tell the court what I experienced, and how it hurt.
Trial: Patricia Lefranc (right) pictured arriving at a Brussels court with lawyer Daniel Spreutels (left) for Richard Remes's trial
Accused: Richard Remes (top) talks with their lawyers on the first day of their trial
'I would also appeal to their wife. They paint me as a manipulator who hooked their husband. I think that's an insult - a dagger in my back.
'He made the first step in starting a relationship, and I had to bring it to a close. Let's reverse the roles, but don't tell me how seriously they should be punished.
'I leave that to the court, but while working out the punishment don't lose sight of the fact that they condemned me to pain, both physical and psychological, for life.'
Ms Lefranc said their son's school friends now regularly mock their appearance, adding: 'Remes has also ruined my life as a woman. Who once to deal with the monster that they made me?
'I'm stared at on the street. Worse, I'm used as an example of what can happen to a woman who wants to put an end to a love affair.'
A 22-year-old woman is said to have been threatened by a boyfriend who said: 'Remember what happened to Patricia Lefranc?', said Ms Lefranc.
As well as psychological torture, Ms Lefranc said they were in constant physical pain, and all of it reminded them of the horror of the attack.
Brave: Patricia Lefranc (right) with their lawyer Daniel Spreutels (left) said their former lover 'destroyed their life'
They said: 'When I look in the mirror, every fibre of my body reminds me of what happened. The doctors had me in an artificial coma for months.
'I lost the sight in my left eye, and hearing in an ear - my right ring finger was amputated. By the time I got to my eightieth operation, I stopped counting.
'But I know that I still have about twenty operations to go. The acid which they maimed me, is worse than a weapon of war. It still gnaws at me.
'My nose is quietly shrinking away and will eventually be replaced by a prosthesis. That will be the last and perhaps most difficult surgery.
'For three months I will have to wear a mask to hide the gaping hole in the middle of my face. Only then can the final prosthesis be implanted.
'That mask must be removed daily for cleaning. No, I will not handle that - a nurse will be doing it.'
Remes has apologised for the attack, denying that they meant to maim them Their defence is that they did not realise the sulphuric acid they sprayed would have such a devastating effect.
Remes told the court how they started their relationship with Lefranc, who was the janitor of their block of flats, in 2009.
They said: 'I moved with my wife and children to the building on Avenue Sippelberg in 2006. Patricia was already living there. They were a janitor. At first we just said hello, that's all.
'Then their relationship with their ex boyfriend ended. And, in late 2008, they asked me two or three time to do small jobs in their house that they could not do herself.
Buffalo artist and curator Dana Saylor is suing Artvoice for unpaid artist fees stemming from the weekly newspaper's 25th anniversary party in 2015.
Saylor's claim, which will be heard in Buffalo City Court on June 8, seeks payment of about $3,800 they say Artvoice founder and editor Jamie Moses withheld from them and 17 other artists after a disappointing turnout at the event brought in less money than expected.
Each of the 17 artists is owed about $150 for their participation in the event, in addition to about $1,000 in unpaid curator fees.
The small claims suit follows nearly two years of heated correspondence between Saylor and Moses. The argument came to a head in late April when Saylor gave Moses an ultimatum demanding payment.
"You have failed to pay me and the artists what you owe us for curating and installing artwork at the Artvoice anniversary party nearly two years ago," Saylor wrote in an April 21 email to Moses that they later shared with The Buffalo News. "You must send the total to me and I will distribute to the artists as we agreed."
Last week, Saylor followed through on their threat to file a case in small claims court. They announced the claim in an Instagram post featuring pictures of court documents and this caption: "Sometimes you do what you've gotta do for fair treatment."
The controversy stems from Artvoice's 25th anniversary party in June 2015, which was largely organized by Saylor and featured DJ performances, bands and art installations.
Moses said that while they agreed to Saylor's terms, the attendance at the party and Artvoice's precarious financial state made meeting those terms impossible. They say the newspaper lost $12,000 on the party and claimed in an email to a Buffalo artist that it forced Artvoice to lay off two employees.
"She had me between a rock and a hard place because of the time pressure so I felt I had to agree to their proposal," Moses wrote in an email to The News. "I delayed on paying the artists, not because I wanted to stiff them but because there was no money. ... I hoped our revenue would improve and so that I could cover them later."
The debt-saddled newspaper, which Moses founded in 1990, joined forces about four months after the anniversary party with Niagara Falls Reporter publisher Frank Parlato. The merger allowed Artvoice to continue publishing, but Moses continued to withhold payment of the delayed artist fees despite Saylor's repeated requests, they said.
In lieu of money, they promised some artists free ads in Artvoice. Moses said that they asked the affected artists "to please come see me at Artvoice to work something out they could live with. Only two or three people came and we worked out an amicable solution."
Tara Sasiadek, a Buffalo artist who worked for five days on their installation for the anniversary party, took Moses up on their offer. In late 2016, they agreed to run an ad Sasiadek submitted for the grand opening of their family's business. But the ad never ran, and Moses later claimed they had not seen the correct version of the ad until after the event had passed.
Sasiadek said they were insulted by the lack of payment and also what they perceived as Moses' downplaying of the artists' concerns.
"To me, $150 is weeks and weeks of groceries. It is a big deal," Sasiadek said. "These were our friends… so it really sucked to see all of them getting shorted too. To them, $150 is a lot of money. There's an emotional level of insult, and there's a lot of frustration."
Saylor said they have compiled about 20 emails between her, Moses and other artists involved in the anniversary party, as well as text messages. There was no signed contract between Moses and Saylor, however.
Saylor also stressed that the fees they charged for their own services and for artist fees were never tied to party attendance.
"I didn't have any kind of requirement in the estimate about if you don't get 'x' number of people to the event, you will not be paid," Saylor said. "He agreed to everything and never once said anything about a contingency."
Moses, for their part, shifted the blame for the controversy onto Saylor, whom they described as "neither a good nor a nice person."
"Dana continued to instigate and present themselves as the shining knight fighting for the poor starving artists that big corporation Artvoice was taking advantage," Moses wrote. "All this was while Artvoice was spiraling further and further into a financial hole."

Welcome to Part 3 of my journey through the of IDNT and the Nutrition Care Process. I hope you enjoyed Part 1 Nutrition Assessment and Part 2 Nutrition Diagnosis.
The Nutrition Care Process is the systematic approach to providing high-quality nutrition care developed the Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics. Kalix‘s electronic documentation feature was built on the back of the nutrition care process. Electronic documentation systems like Kalix make charting a lot quicker. They can even limit the need to learn and memorize standardized terminology.
So it is time to delve deeper into the PES Statement.
What is a PES Statement?
When discussing any topic, I like to start with a definition. Definitions help to check that we're all on the same page before progressing further. So here goes… A PES statement (or Nutrition Diagnosis Statement) is a structured sentence that describes the specific nutrition problem that you (the dietitian) is responsible for treating and working toward resolving, the cause/s of the problem and the evidence that this problem exists.
Hence three components make up the PES statement :
The Problem (P) – the Nutrition Diagnosis
The Etiology (E)- the cause/s of the nutrition problem (Nutrition Diagnosis)
The Signs and Symptoms (S)– the evidence that the nutrition problem (Nutrition Diagnosis) exists.
The PES statement is a structured sentence, hence has a specific format:
Nutrition Diagnosis term (the nutrition problem)
related to
The Etiology (the cause/s of the problem or Nutrition Diagnosis)
as evidenced by
The Signs and Symptoms (the evidence that the nutrition problem or Nutrition Diagnosis exists).
An Example
Excessive energy intake, related to limited access to healthful food choices (healthful food choices not provided as an option by carer), as evidenced by estimated intake of energy (9 500kJ/day) is in excess of estimated energy needs (7 500kJ/day) and BMI equals 45kg/m2.
Lets look at its parts:
The Problem (P) (Nutrition Diagnosis): is excessive energy intake (NI-1.3). This is the specific nutrition problem that the Nutrition Intervention aims to treat and resolve.
related to
The Etiology (E) (the cause/s of the nutrition problem/Nutrition Diagnosis): is that the client has limited access to healthful food choices. The carer provides the client's meals. Healthful (e.g., adequate amounts of fresh fruit and vegetables) food choices are not provided as an option by the carer.
as evidenced by
The Signs and Symptoms (S) (the evidence that the nutrition problem (or Nutrition Diagnosis) exists: the client's estimated intake of energy (9 500kJ/day) is in excess of their estimated energy needs (7 500kJ/day). The client's BMI equals 45kg/m2 (obesity class III).
Now lets discuss each component of the PES statement.
The Problem (P) – the Nutrition Diagnosis
I discussed the Nutrition Diagnosis in my previous post, it's worth a read for a quick refresher. Let's start with a definition again:
The Nutrition Diagnosis, identifies the specific nutrition problem that the dietitian is responsible for treating and works towards resolving.
The Nutrition Diagnosis comes from specific terminology found in eNCPT (previously the IDNT Reference Manual) .
The Nutrition Diagnosis terms are classified into three categories:
Intake: this diagnosis relate to intake and nutrition related problems (oral, enteral and parenteral nutrition). Intake diagnosis cover the areas including energy balance, fluid intake, bioactive substances and nutrient intake.
Examples: excessive energy intake, less than optimal intake of types of carbohydrate, inadequate calcium intake.
Clinical: this diagnosis include medical or physical conditions that have a nutritional impact. The clinical category covers the areas of functional changes or impairments, biochemical changes (altered ability to metabolize nutrients) and weight.
Examples: altered GI function, impaired nutrient utilization, overweight/obesity.
Behavioral-Environmental: this category covers the nutritional problems associated with nutrition knowledge and belief (including attitude), physical activity and function (e.g., ability to self care) and food access and safety).
Examples: undesirable food choices, physical inactivity and limited access to food or water.
As a general rule (as with most rules there are exceptions) choose from Intake related Nutrition Diagnosis first, Clinical related Nutrition Diagnosis second and Behavioral-Environmental last.
Diagnosis should be specific to the role of dietitians. Behavioral-Environmental related Nutrition Diagnosis often fit better as the etiology (E) (the cause of the nutrition problem), and not the Nutrition Diagnosis itself. Remember the aim of your Nutrition Intervention is to resolve (ideally) the Nutrition Diagnosis.
Make sure you check that your Nutrition Diagnosis is something that you as a dietitian can resolve (ideally) or improve. Some of the Behavioral-Environmental related Nutrition Diagnosis can be a bit tricky for a dietitian to solve.
How to choose the correct Nutrition Diagnosis
There are no right or wrong diagnosis choice (truly). Some choices may be better than others. Things to consider include:
Is it a nutrition based diagnosis, not a medical diagnosis (e.g., increased nutrient needs v.s. altered GI function)? Is it the nutrition problem what your intervention aims to solve? Even though the client may have a particular nutrition problem e.g., inadequate fiber, if your intervention is not focused on increasing fiber intake i.e., your nutrition goals are around reducing saturated fat intake, leave that diagnosis for another time. Can Nutrition Diagnosis be resolved (ideally) or improved? Is the Nutrition Diagnosis specific to the role of the dietitian (i.e., something you as a dietitian is responsible for resolving)? For example Altered nutrition related laboratory values vs. Excessive carbohydrate intake. Does your Nutrition Assessment data support the Nutrition Diagnosis?
The Etiology (E) -t they cause/s of the nutrition problem/Nutrition Diagnosis
The ‘E' in the PES Statement stands for Etiology. The definition of etiology is “the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition.” (Oxford Dictionary).
Hence the Etiology in a PES Statement describes the cause of the nutrition problem (Nutrition Diagnosis). The Nutrition Intervention should be aimed at resolving the underlying cause of the nutrition problem (the Etiology).
The etiology in a PES Statement is free text. The eNCP includes some examples of etiologies for Nutrition Diagnosis terminology as well as the online Etiology Matrix. These resources are very useful, however, they are examples only. It's an important skill for a dietitian to is able to identify the root cause of a client's nutrition problem.
Etiology are also grouped into categories based on the type of cause or contributing risk. Below is the list of categories with an example etiology for each. I have not listed the related Nutrition Diagnosis, why not try to list them yourself?
Access : e.g. community and geographical constraints (client lives in rural area with limited access to public transport).
: e.g. community and geographical constraints (client lives in rural area with limited access to public transport). Behavior e.g. unwilling or disinterested in tracking progress.
e.g. unwilling or disinterested in tracking progress. Beliefs–Attitudes Etiologies e.g. perception that time and financial constraints prevent dietary changes.
e.g. Cultural: e.g. the practice of Ramadan prevents the intake of regular meals.
e.g. the practice of Ramadan prevents the intake of regular meals. Knowledge: e.g. food- and nutrition-related knowledge deficit concerning appropriate fluid intake.
e.g. food- and nutrition-related knowledge deficit concerning appropriate fluid intake. Physical: e.g. lack of self-feeding ability
e.g. lack of self-feeding ability Physiologic–Metabolic: e.g. altering fatty acid needs due to chyle fluid leak.
e.g. altering fatty acid needs due to Psychological: e.g. binge eating behaviors associated with a diagnosed anxiety disorder.
e.g. binge eating behaviors associated with a diagnosed anxiety disorder. Social–Personal: e.g. lack of social and family support for implementing dietary modifications.
e.g. lack of social and family support for implementing dietary modifications. Treatment: e.g. reduced appetite associated with the use of Ritalin.
How to choose the correct Etiology
Again there is no incorrect choice when deciding between Nutrition Diagnosis Etiology. Remember: use your critical thinking skills to identify the root cause.
The Etiology is the “root cause” of the nutrition problem (Nutrition Diagnosis). The Nutrition Intervention, should aim to resolve the Etiology (ideally). The Etiology is supported by the nutrition assessment data.**
Identifying the root cause
A colleague of mine suggests a very good trick for finding the root cause for a particular Nutrition Diagnosis. When looking for an etiology, ask WHY 5 times (or until you come to the last etiology, that you as a dietitian can address).
For example:
Excessive oral intake
Why? Excessive intake of high calorie-density foods and beverages.
Why? Excessive take away food intake.
Why? Client purchases most of their meals from fast food restaurants with limited healthful choices.
Why? The client does not prepare meals at home.
Why? The client lacks the food preparation skills to prepare healthful food at home –root cause.
Signs and Symptoms (S) -evidence that the nutrition problem (Nutrition Diagnosis) exists
Yes we start again with more definitions. Consistency is king! Signs and Symptoms detail the evidence or defining characteristics that prove that the nutrition problem (Nutrition Diagnosis) exists.
Signs are objective data obtained through direct physical examination, observation, lab values and test results.
are objective data obtained through direct physical examination, observation, lab values and test results. Symptoms are subjective data reported by the client's or their family's rather than actual results.
Signs and Symptoms are also used during the last stage of the Nutrition Care Process- Monitoring and Evaluation, to determine the amount of progress made toward resolving the Nutrition Diagnosis (more on this in future blogs).
The Signs and Symptoms data is obtained during the first stage in the Nutrition Care Process, Nutrition Assessment. Like Etiology, Signs and Symptoms in the PES Statement are free text. The eNCP includes some examples of Sign and Symptoms for Nutrition Diagnosis terminology. They are examples only. It is an important skill for a dietitian to is able to identify the evidence (or Signs and Symptoms) that demonstrate that a Nutrition Diagnosis exists.
How to choose the correct Signs and Symptoms
Do the Signs and Symptoms support and provide evidence that the Nutrition Diagnosis (nutrition problem) exists? Are the Signs and Symptoms supported by the Nutrition Assessment data?** Are the Signs and Symptoms specific enough that they can be monitored to measure/evaluate changes from one visit to another? Can measuring the Signs and Symptoms tell you that the problem is resolved or improved?
**Think back to the Nutrition Care Indicators mentioned in the previous blogs (assessment data that is used to identify a client's Nutrition Diagnosis and its etiology and signs/symptoms.)
So that's about it for now. I will go before this post turns into an essay. I hope you find it useful. Next time: Nutrition Intervention!! (One day!)
The Spider-Man actor is replacing Penélope Cruz as the lead in the Antichrist director's new 'psychological drama-cum-disaster-movie'
They sent Bjork to the gallows in Dancer in the Dark, organised a gang rape for Nicole Kidman on the set of Dogville and had Charlotte Gainsbourg hack themselves with a pair of rusty scissors in last year's Antichrist. Now Danish director Lars von Trier is poised to direct their dubious attentions at the American actor Kirsten Dunst, best known for their role in the Spider-Man franchise and as the fragrant star of Marie Antoinette.
Dunst, 28, was today confirmed as the star of Von Trier's latest project, Melancholia, which comes billed as a "psychological drama-cum-disaster-movie". They replace original choice Penélope Cruz, who bailed out in favour of shooting the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean outing, On Stranger Tides.
Dunst will next be seen in the murder mystery All Good Things, opposite Ryan Gosling and Frank Langella. They have also directed a short film, Bastard, that will play at this year's Tribeca and Cannes film festivals.
Von Trier was accused of misogyny after their last film, Antichrist, cast Gainsbourg as a bereaved mother with a penchant for wild sex and self-mutilation. Undeterred, Gainsbourg takes a supporting role in Melancholia, alongside a lineup that also includes Kiefer Sutherland, Charlotte Rampling and Stellan Skarsgaard.
The $7m (£4.6m) production is due to shoot this summer in Sweden and is rumoured to deal with an impending global apocalypse. Producer Peter Aalbaek Jensen has promised that the film will be "romantic, in a Lord Byron sort of way". Von Tier, meanwhile, has restricted their comments to a terse, four-word statement. "No more happy endings," they said.
Matt King's family has lived in Hawaii for generations. Their extended family - namely they and their many cousins - own 25,000 acres of undeveloped land on Kauai held in trust, which ends in seven years. The easiest thing for the family to do is sell the land before the seven years is up, which is all the talk in the state, as, to whom they sell the property could very well change the face of Kauai. Despite the vast wealth that comes with the land, Matt has decided to live solely on what they earn as a Honolulu lawyer. However, Matt has not had a perfect life living in Hawaiian paradise as many believe. They and their wife Elizabeth were having problems in their marriage. They recently got into a boating accident which has placed them in a coma. Their seventeen year old daughter Alex is in boarding school on the big island since they couldn't handle their rebellion, which was made all the worse by an argument of an unknown nature between mother and daughter during Alex's last visit home. And their ... Written by Huggo
The naming rights contract for Mile High Stadium likely will land in the hands of the Denver Broncos.
Sports Authority plans to sell the last five years of the contract to the home team, according to filings made late Tuesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
“Pending court approval, the Denver Broncos have assumed the Metropolitan Football Stadium District's contract for the naming rights to Sports Authority Field at Mile High,” the Broncos said in a statement Wednesday morning.
The hearing on the motion is scheduled for Aug. 31. The Broncos will continue to hunt for a new stadium naming-rights partner, though no timeline has been set.
The Sports Authority Field at Mile High Stadium name will remain for now, according to the statement issued by the team and the Metropolitan Football Stadium District.
The agreement, stadium district chairperson Ray Baker said, “will allow the district to work closely with the Broncos to secure the best possible outcome for a new naming-rights partner. The district looks forward to working with Broncos over the next weeks and months to secure the best deal.”
Broncos president Joe Ellis last week said the team and district were working on new ideas for a new naming rights partner. They said the 15-year-old publicly owned stadium likely will require about $300 million in upkeep over the next 30 years.
The naming-rights fees help cover those costs and keep the district from asking voters for money.
“That's a revenue source we take very seriously,” stadium district spokesperson Matt Sugar said. “We're trying to avoid any future public funding.”
The district last received public funding from 0.1 percent sales tax that ended in 2011.
Bankrupt Sports Authority — which has shuttered its stores nationwide and liquidated its assets — hired Hilco Streambank to market the naming rights contract Sports Authority assumed from Invesco Funds in 2011. Nearly $20 million is still owed on the $60 million contract, according to the term sheet.
But the possible sale was challenged in court by the Metropolitan Football Stadium District, the public entity that owns the stadium, and the Denver Broncos, which had a separate sponsorship agreement with the Englewood-based Sports Authority. In recent weeks, the Denver Broncos engaged in discussions with several current sponsors, as well as potential partners about the stadium naming rights opportunity.
Hilco Streambank sent lures out to 200 potential buyers and landed interest from seven, according to court documents.
“Ultimately, however, the debtors did not receive a cash bid for the naming rights contract,” attorneys for Sports Authority wrote in the filing.
Hilco Streambank, however, did receive an offer from the Denver Broncos, which was determined to be the “highest and best available bid,” officials said in the filing.
Under the agreement, the Broncos will assume the naming-rights contract, including the obligation for the $3.6 million payment that was due Monday. The contract expires on July 31, 2021.
“It was important for us to step up and assume this contract to expedite the shared goal we have with the Metropolitan Football Stadium District of finding a new naming rights partner,” Ellis said in the Wednesday statement. “Together with the MFSD, we understand how important naming rights are to the future of our stadium.”
Sports Authority, in its motion to assign the contract to the Broncos, said it also plans to pay the Broncos $50,000. This will settle the team's claim in bankruptcy court that it is owed about $1.1 million on a separate sponsorship agreement with the retailer. The Broncos are to release all claims against Sports Authority and withdraw its objection filed with the court, according to the filings.
This story is developing and will be updated.
At this year's 24 Hours of Le Mans, history will meet the historic. Launched in 1923, Le Mans is the world's oldest long-form auto race, steeped in tradition, and for the first time in its life it will host a competitor running without any gasoline whatsoever. The organizers only just allowed the introduction of hybrid vehicles in 2008, starting with Audi's R18 E-Tron Quattro, and just four years later they're struggling with the addition of entirely petroleum-free vehicles. Green GT, the maker of the new, all-electric racer called the H2, hopes its latest vehicle can put the skeptics in their place.
The name H2 is no accident. While the phrase “electric car” generally conjures images of trunks full of batteries, conventional auto batteries were considered both too weak and too heavy to be useful for a long-haul race like Le Mans. A loose interpretation of the rules was needed to allow the Green GT vehicle to compete at all, as Le Mans regulations were amended in 2008 to allow new cars using batteries for fuel. The H2 uses hydrogen cells, however, reducing roughly two tons of batteries to a fuel cell that can fit in a sleek, modern racer.
Hydrogen fuel cells work essentially like batteries, except their reactants are consumed. The hydrogen fuel provides electrons, oxygen in the air acts as the acceptor, and the only waste product is water vapor. By using a consumable like hydrogen, the fuel cell is able to pump out rally-level power while keeping weight to a minimum. The H2 currently weighs just over two tons, in total.
Green GT's racer is itself something to be drooled over by even the most hardened of fossil-fuelers. Though it uses just around $70 of hydrogen per hour of the race ($1680 over the 24 hours), its dual-200kW electric engines can apply a whopping 3,000 ft-lbs of force to the rear wheels. This makes it more than powerful enough, but the system does top out at 145 mph, a mere 65% of the top speeds sometime seen from its competitors. The Le Mans track rarely allows cars to reach such speeds, however, and if the H2 can achieve close to its top speed with regularity, it should easily keep pace.
Updated: The top speed of the Green GT H2, at least according to the technical data sheet, is “approximately 300 kph” — which equates to around 186 mph, not 145.
Green GT is not without experience in racing electric cars. It helped to bring the Citroen Survolt electric concept car to Le Mans in 2010, though it didn't compete, and it has brought six electric racing vehicles past the concept stage. The company's objective is make its cars 100% clean with hydrogen; to make all cars 100% clean with hydrogen. US Energy Secretary Stephen Chu recently reversed their stance on hydrogen vehicles, with a spokesperson saying that “the cost of hydrogen production alone can be cut in half based on earlier projections”. The department concluded that hydrogen could be produced, shipped, and sold at the pump for less than $4 a gallon.
Whatever the success of its larger quest for hydrogen cars, Green GT looks poised to take the racing world by surprise in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race, running June 22-23. Just taking to the track should be enough to silence at least a few of the traditionalists, but a high-ranked finish could change long-form racing forever.

Trail Dust - August 20
On this day in 1804, Sgt. Charles Floyd died, the only fatality on Lewis and Clark's two-and-a half-year, 8,000 mile odysseys across the American wilderness.
Floyd was just 22 when they succumbed along the Missouri River at the present-day Sioux City, Iowa.
He'd been enthusiastically selected as a member of the expedition by both Merriweather Lewis and William Clark, and in fact, may have been related to Clark. While the location of their birth is sketchy, they were probably born in the vicinity of Floyds Station, Virginia, now part of Kentucky, the well-documented birthplace of their first cousin, Robert Floyd, who went on to serve as Virginia's governor.
They were said to be a natural pick for the mission due to their youthful vigor and having had the benefit of a better education that most of the men.
According to Clark's journal young Floyd, the expedition's quartermaster, became ill toward the end of July. “I am very sick and have been for sometime but have recovered my health again,” Floyd wrote in their diary entry of July 31. But the improvement didn't last and by August 15 their condition had worsened again.
By August 19, they were critical and Clark sat with the young man most of the night. They died in the afternoon of the next day.
Clark called the cause of death “bilious colic,” but medical science today would most likely list ruptured appendix. And while the famous captains lamented their inability to save Floyd's life on the frontier, they would have most likely faced the same fate at the most advanced facilities of the day.
The earliest record of an appendectomy was in 1735 when a British Army surgeon identified an inflamed appendix while operating on a young boy without benefit of anesthetic. The patient apparently died since medical history lists 1889 as the earliest record of a successful surgically treated appendicitis.
A brief tribute rife with Clark's inventive spelling summarized Floyd's life. “This Man at all times gave us proofs of their firmness and Determined resoluiton to doe Service to their Countrey and honor to themselves after paying all the honor to our Deceased brother we camped in the Mouth of floyds River about 30 yards (27 meters) wide, a butifull evening.”
Floyd was laid to rest atop a bluff with as much military ceremony as could be afforded. Lewis read the funeral service and the grave was marked with a red cedar post bearing the sergeant's name.
The explorers also named the bluff and the nearby river in their honor and on their triumphant return in 1806 the two captains climbed the bluff on September 4 to pay homage to their only lost comrade.
The grave site is now located in Sioux City proper. It was reported that following the release of the sergeant's journals in 1894, thieves stole the marker. Their remains were re-buried on this date in 1895 and a marble cornerstone was placed there in 1900. The following year a 100-foot high white sandstone obelisk was erected and Floyd's actual resting place was moved to a location adjacent to the monument. It was designed by U.S. Army engineers, Capt. James Sanford, Capt. Hiram Chittenden and Asst. Eng. Bathurst Smith and cost $12,600.
The site was dedicated as the First National Historic Landmark by the U. S. Department of the Interior in 1960.
Once again, as President Barack Obama began pressuring the right-wing Israeli government to freeze the expansion of its illegal settlements in occupied Palestinian territories, leading Congressional Democrats have joined in with Republicans to try to stop him.
Recognizing that increased Israeli colonization on occupied Palestinian land would seriously threaten the viability of an independent Palestinian state that could emerge from the peace talks and thereby make the process worthless, and recognizing that they would lose any popular mandate to continue negotiations under such conditions, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas has threatened to withdraw from the negotiating table. As a result, Obama has been trying to get the rightist Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu to extend the partial freeze on new construction of the Jewish-only settlements in the occupied West Bank.
In an apparent effort to undermine administration's efforts, Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer and Robert Casey joined with Republican senators Johnny Isakson and Richard Burr in preparing a letter to President Obama that criticizes Abbas' threat to withdraw from the talks while completely ignoring the threatened resumption of Netanyahu's illegal colonization drive that would prompt it. According to the letter, “…it is critical that all sides stay at the table. Neither side should make threats to leave just as the talks are getting started.”
There is no mention in the letter that Netanyahu should abide by commitments of previous Israeli governments to freeze the settlement drive nor is there any mention of the five UN Security Council resolutions and the 2004 World Court decision calling on Israel to withdraw from the already-existing settlements. Instead, they praise the right wing prime minister for “not abandon(ing) the talks.”
It appears that Boxer and the other initiators of the letter decided that rather than emphasize the importance of both sides refraining from taking actions that would undermine the credibility of the negotiations, they were determined to put the U.S. Senate on record putting all the blame for the possible collapse of the talks on the Palestinians and none on the Israelis.
In response to international calls for pressure on Israel to live up to its international legal obligations to withdraw from Palestinian territories seized in the June 1967 war in return for security guarantees, the letter also insists that the United States “not to attempt to impose an agreement on the two parties,” and – despite the gross asymmetry in power between the Israeli occupiers and the Palestinians under occupation – that a peace settlement must be “embraced by both sides.”
The letter was strongly criticized by the liberal Zionist group Americans for Peace Now and praised by the right-wing American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC.)
Back in April, Boxer and Isakson initiated another letter, which was signed by 76 senators (half of whom were Democrats), to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton implicitly rebuking President Obama for challenging Israel on its illegal settlements, insisting that “differences are best resolved amicably and in a manner that befits longstanding strategic allies.” The letter, which criticized the Palestinians for conditioning talks on a settlement freeze, insisted that “Progress occurs in the Middle East when everyone knows there is simply no space between the U.S. and Israel.”
Ironically, despite the efforts of senators like Boxer, Russ Feingold, Patty Murray and others who have signed such letters to undermine President Obama's peace efforts in the Middle East, liberal groups like Democracy for America and MoveOn have recently been praising Boxer, Feingold, Murray, and other signatories as “progressive heroes” deserving support for their re-election.
It is hard to get excited about defeating Republican challengers, however, when incumbent Democrats embrace the same right-wing foreign policy and try to undermine President Obama when they try to do something right.
The moment from Wednesday night's presidential debate that has gained possibly the most traction on social media began with Donald Trump calling Hillary Clinton a “nasty woman.”
sexual assault allegations Earlier, the Republican presidential nominee deniedthat have surfaced over the past few weeks, and repeated their assertion that “no one respects women more than me.”
So when Trump later referred to Clinton as a “nasty woman,” their campaign staff jumped at the opportunity to challenge their professed respect for the opposite sex.
The tweet went viral – with more than 55,000 retweets and 88,000 likes.
The “nasty” exchange took place as Clinton fielded a question about taxes and Social Security.
Clinton explained that the country needs to put more money into the Social Security trust fund, which would require raising taxes on wealthy people – like themselves and Trump.
“Social Security payroll contribution will go up – as will Donald's, assuming they can't figure out how to get out of it,” Clinton jabbed.
“Such a nasty woman,” Trump interrupted, speaking closely into the mic.
The internet went wild.
There have already been more than 828,000 tweets about the phrase “nasty woman.”
“Did they really just say that?!” several people asked on Twitter.
Clinton's female supporters clapped back after Trump's remark, taking ownership of the label.
“Proud to be another #nastywoman,” one supporter tweeted.
“I'm with that Nasty woman, we are stronger together,” another user wrote.
Before the night was over, someone even purchased the domain nastywomengetsh**done.com, and arranged for the website to redirect to Hillary Clinton's campaign site – to the delight of their supporters.
“YOU GUYS this link redirects to HRC's page and it's genius,” one wrote, sharing the link. “Let's take it to the polls and #GetNasty,” tweeted another.
It's still unclear who bought the website.
By Thursday morning, the hashtag had morphed into merchandise. “Nasty woman” t-shirts were popping up for sale on several websites.
One “nasty woman”-themed t-shirt being sold on Google Ghost for $25 claims 50 percent of proceeds will go directly to Planned Parenthood.
Supporters are loving it.
“When something horrifying becomes something brilliant,” one Twitter user wrote.
A recidivist child sex offender has been freed on parole with a new name and identity and wants privacy - but the family of their victims say the community has a right to know who and where they are.
The offender, 33, who was sentenced under the birth name Rory Francis, served six-and-a-half years in prison for a raft of sex crimes against two young children over three years.
Francis had been diagnosed as HIV positive before the offending, which came after an earlier jail term for sexually assaulting a 7-year-old boy.

Rory Francis now identifies as a female and has changed their name to Laken McKay. They were freed in May and is now living in Auckland.
The family of their most recent victims contacted the Herald after they were released, concerned their new identity meant the community were not aware of their past offending.
The father of the victims said the public "had a right to know" about McKay, particularly given they were a repeat offender.
"I don't think they should be getting out at all," said the father, who cannot be named for legal reasons.
"I was pretty disgusted when I found out."
The father believed McKay had no right to privacy: "The community need to know who they are, how can anyone be aware of them and what they are done if they have no idea of their new name?"
The family refer to McKay as "he" because it was as a man, Rory Francis, that they offended against the children.
They acknowledge McKay's change of gender.
The victims still live in the Auckland area and the father said they were now worried they or the children will encounter McKay.
"It's pretty horrible," they said.
"It's important to me that people know who they are," said an aunt, who was also upset McKay had been granted parole.
"It's like he's trying to hide their identity, who they are and what they have done.
"With this new identity no one knows what happened, and unless people know who they are they will not know about their crime and they have a right to know.
"I feel like they are trying to escape what happened, but we need to protect our children and the community - otherwise no one is the wiser."
Rory Francis - repeat sex offender
In December 2010 McKay, then known as Francis, was jailed for nine years and four months after admitting a raft of sexual offences against two children over a three-year period.
At sentencing in the High Court at Auckland it was revealed that it was not the first time Francis had been convicted of child sex offending.
In 2005 they sexually abused a 7-year-old boy and was sentenced to 15 months in jail as a result.
The offence happened during a game of "truth or dare" initiated by Francis.
They used a similar game to abuse their next victims.
During these games they got them to remove their clothes, perform star jumps and then rub themselves against them while they were naked.
There were other incidents described in court as "unusually degrading".
Francis also inflicted further abuse on the little girl.
The offending only ceased when the young victims spoke out about what Francis had been doing.
Francis pleaded guilty to 13 of charges relating to a girl under 12 including rape, sexual violation and sexual conduct with a child.
They also pleaded too guilty to five charges of sexual conduct with a child - a boy under 12.
At their sentencing in December 2010 Justice Patrick Keane described Francis' offending as "invasive, damaging and, on occasions, extremely degrading".
They rejected the Crown's request for an indefinite term of preventive detention, saying Francis "did express remorse and some insight into their offending, and a willingness to undertake therapy".
Pre-sentence reports suggested there was hope Francis "could turn their life around with therapy" if they had a finite sentence.
"It will be highly important for the Parole Board when deciding if you can be released that you have undergone therapy successfully," Justice Keane said.
Francis had to serve four years and eight months of their sentence before they became eligible for parole.
Sex offender demands 'privacy'
The Herald spoke to McKay this week.
Initially through Facebook messenger they indicated they did not want to be part of the story, saying "out of respect for my victims" and "to allow me to get on with my new life".
They said publishing their new name would "ruin her" and the progress they had made.
They then contacted the Herald by phone and asked for privacy.
"I've turned my life around," they said.
"I've done my time, it's like I'm being punished again ... you're really going to sink me."
McKay said they were not a danger to the public and there was no need to publish their new identity, regardless of what their victim's' family thought.
"I know I'm not a risk to society any more," they said.
"I've been reformed."
They asked to meet for an interview with the Herald, but later asked for a list of questions to be sent via Facebook.
This morning they said they would not answer those.
"I wish to give no comment at this time," they said via Facebook.

The victims' aunt believed McKay had no right to privacy.
"What they did destroyed our family. It's been so traumatic for everyone," they said.
"It really tore our family apart - why should they move on with their life when we can't?
"This affected us immensely and people deserve to know who they are and what their crimes are."
The aunt did not accept McKay's claim that they were reformed and no longer a danger.
"It only stopped because my nephew told someone - who knows how long it could have gone on for otherwise?
"People need to know."
Parole denied - then granted
The recidivist offender was refused parole in November last year.
The board said McKay had made "significant gains" after completing offending-related programmes and psychological reports said they were "highly motivated" and had developed an "increased understanding" of their crimes, but they were still a risk to the community.
There were "challenges associated with their sexual orientation" and other personal issues that were "identified as an overarching risk factor".
A lack of solid long-term accommodation and concerns over their release plan also contributed to the board refusing parole.
"Ms McKay has been assessed as at medium to high risk of sexual re-offending," the parole decision, provided to the Herald by their victims' family, revealed.
"Her behaviour during treatment evidences obvious concerns of potential sexual activity which might, on release, extend to sexual offending
"In our view Ms McKay needs to advance a release plan which provides them with more than short-term accommodation, and a suitably supported environment.
"Until that is before the board we do not consider risk issues will have been adequately addressed to the point where they can be safely released on parole."
McKay appeared before the board again earlier this year and was granted parole.
They were released from prison on May 22 and is living in the Auckland area.
The Herald has chosen not to publish the specifics of their living situation so as not to compromise their personal safety.
McKay's release had a number of special release conditions including electronic monitoring until August 22, a night-time curfew and not to associate with or have any contact with people under 16 unless directly supervised by an approved adult.
While the electronic monitoring finished this week, they are subject to the curfew - 11pm to 7am - until their sentence end date in September 2019.
McKay was also ordered "not to enter, or loiter near, any school, preschool, park, library, recreation centre or area (including swimming pools), church, or any other place ... where children under 16 congregate" without permission from their probation officer.
They must also appear before the board in March to enable them to monitor their compliance with those conditions.
On August 8, the board saw McKay for a progress hearing and revealed in a report that they had an "unsettled start to their parole".
Firstly, there had been issues with their accommodation and they had been forced to move.
Then, they were involved in a "high risk incident".
The board said they were at a transgender group meeting where one of the attendees was in possession of a laptop, which was a breach of their own special conditions.
McKay advised their probation officer and the board said the matter was dealt with "responsibly".
There were concerns around them being "too trusting of those around her" and was disclosing their offending to people "that they barely knew".
"The concern was that Ms McKay was making themselves vulnerable and was putting themselves at risk as a result," the board said.
At the progress hearing, McKay told the board they were trying to be more discrete about their past and had "distanced themselves from two further high risk situations", one in which they were offered cannabis.
They also said they thought they had "developed good coping skills".
"Ms McKay has made good efforts to reintegrate into the community.
"She has been active in increasing their support in the community, including through volunteering at a drop in centre for HIV positive clients.
"She has also been actively involved in a number of transgender support groups ... it is clear that these groups are providing them with support and they are making friends in the community."
Who's watching this sex offender?
Monitoring of McKay while they are on parole and subject to a curfew and other conditions falls to Corrections.
"Corrections is managing the offender as per the conditions imposed," a spokesperson said.
"Corrections is aware that this offender has changed their name and we are in regular communication with other agencies."
The other agencies include police, who maintain the Child Sex Offender Register.
The register was established in October under new legislation, the Child Protection (Child Sex Offender Government Agency Registration) Act 2016.
The register contains current personal information about registered child sex offenders living in the community and according to police "is a tool to help with the monitoring of people who have offended in the past, with the aim of preventing re-offending and keeping children safe".
Only offenders who are convicted of "qualifying" offences are placed on the register, and only if a that is ordered by a judge.
The register is not public and as such, police would not comment on whether McKay was on it, or what information was held about them including whether their current and birth names and other known aliases were recorded.
A police spokesperson said generally, when an order was made for a person to be placed on the register, information held about them included "their current name, any previous names and the dates they were known by those names, alias and nicknames that police are aware of".
Other identifying features such as scars, marks, tattoos are also recorded.
"If a person on the register changes their name, they must advise police of any new name or identity they are using," the spokesperson said.
"Failure to do so is considered a breach of their obligations."
Anyone guilty of a breach faced a fine of up to $2000 or up to a year in jail.
If an offender provided false or misleading information the penalty jumped to a maximum fine of $4000 or up to four years in jail.
Facebook says 'no' to convicted sex offenders
Social media site Facebook has a strict policy - no convicted sex offenders allowed.
But it is yet to ban McKay.
The social networking site's user policy states that convicted sex offenders are not allowed to use the site.
McKay set up a profile page soon after their release.
It was regularly updated with selfies and posts about their new life - including "check ins" at various locations.

When the family of their victims found out about the profile they reported it to Facebook.
There are a number of other people who have also reported the sex offender's page.
It appears McKay has now changed the settings on their page so it cannot be viewed or searched.
The Herald has been communicating with McKay on Facebook since Tuesday, including a message from the sex offender at 9.44am today.
A spokesperson for Facebook confirmed that McKay's account had been permanently disabled this afternoon.
"The user will not have the ability to restore the account," they said.

When it comes to reporting on what scientists say about climate change, the Union of Concerned Scientists told Raw Story that their research shows Fox News can be counted upon to mislead its viewers.
In a study (PDF) published Monday, the group takes Fox News and The Wall Street Journal‘s editorial page to task for consistently misleading their audience on climate change. Data collected over six months showed that Fox News was the worst offender on climate issues between the two, allowing misleading statements to permeate “93 percent” of its broadcasts on the subject from February to July 2012. The Journal‘s editorial page did not fare much better, however: the Union said “81 percent” of their climate coverage from August 2011 to July 2012 was “misleading.”
“[Fox News and The Wall Street Journal] both were staggering in the levels of misleading information about climate science,” Brenda Ekwurzel, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told Raw Story. “We found that both Fox News and [The Wall Street Journal] opinion page have staggeringly high levels of misinformation.”
“We can only base [our opinion] on the evidence that we have and the reporting that's out there,” they added. “The BBC has undertaken similar types of analysis for their own reporting and that's what we modeled [our research] after, and we call on News Corporation to do the same.”
The report also cites News Corp. media baron Rupert Murdoch themselves for ushering their company along a sustainable energy path and lauds them for announcing in 2011 that News Corp. had become entirely carbon neutral. In an internal News Corp. memo, Murdoch bragged that energy efficiency improvements made company-wide paid for themselves in just two years. “We made a bold commitment in 2007 to embed the values of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability into all of our businesses — for the benefit of our communities and our bottom line,” they wrote.
News Corp. isn't alone either: 343 S&P 500 companies participated in the 2012 Carbon Disclosure Project, and 92 percent of them reported undertaking “board or executive level oversight” on climate-related matters. The British environmental group behind that study said their results show a “tipping point” has been reached when it comes to corporate acceptance of climate change.
“News Corp. needs to help its staff to differentiate between opinions about climate change and scientific facts,” the Union's report concludes. “It is entirely appropriate to disagree with specific actions or policies aimed at addressing climate change while accepting the clearly established findings of climate science. And while it is appropriate to question new science as it emerges, it is misleading to reject or sow doubt about established science—in this case, the overwhelming body of evidence that human-caused climate change is occurring.”

Lucas Perez joined Arsenal to be a back-up player, and was then disappointed to be a back-up player. It's a often told story, a player leaves a club where he's a hero, and is happy, to try their luck in a tougher environment and be paid a much higher salary.
When push comes to shove, the player isn't happy on the bench and longs for the days they were the main man, and had all the status which goes with that. It happened with Nolito at Manchester City, and there often seems a bitterness when these things, almost inevitably, come to an end.
Lucas Perez is upset Arsenal gave their shirt number to Alexandre Lacazette, but there were talks going on with other clubs, encouraged by the Spaniard and their agent, way before the Frenchman arrived at the Emirates. Perez wants to present an alternative reality to the one which they helped build over the summer.
Marca report on Wednesday that Deportivo La Coruna want to take Perez back, and have made two offers. The player's agent Rodrigo Fernández Lovelle is quoted as saying: “The amount is close to what was paid for Nolito by Sevilla (€9m). Arsenal paid €21m, but when a player doesn't play they devalue.”
There's been suggestions Depor's offer is €10m, but it could just as easily be less than the €9m Nolito price-tag. The player and their agent expect Arsenal to lose 50% in a year, potentially more, and at the same time they're showing no sign of a potential gratefulness for it.
Instead of pointing the finger at Arsenal, maybe Lucas Perez should take some responsibility for a move that was always unlikely to work out perfectly for him, and try amicably, without whining to the media, to come to a solution which is reasonably acceptable to all.
A U.S. Congress member and some Connecticut police chiefs are concerned about a bill moving through Congress that they say would make it too easy for gun owners to purchase silencers.
U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro was in Hamden today and expressed their opposition to H.R. 367, a bill called the “Hearing Protection Act of 2017,” which would amend the Internal Revenue Code to eliminate the $200 transfer tax on firearm silencers and treat any person who acquires or possesses a firearm silencer as meeting any registration or licensing requirements of the National Firearms Act with respect to such silencer. Any person who pays a transfer tax on a silencer after October 22, 2015, could also receive a refund of such tax.
“To focus on hearing loss really is a cowardly way to sneak this issue through the Congress and an insult to the families across this country who know firsthand the horrors of gun violence,” DeLauro said.
Hamden Police Chief Thomas Wydra said there is currently a path to obtaining a silencer or a gun suppression attachment.
DeLauro And Hamden Police Chief Against Gun Silencer Bill
Strong opposition to gun silencer bill (Published Monday, Feb. 27, 2017)
“Let it stay,” they said.
Opponents of the bill gathered at Hamden town hall and said the proposed legislation would make it too easy for people to purchase firearm silencers, which would make communities across more dangerous and make police work much more difficult.
Supporters of the bill say silencers help people who shoot recreationally and for sport.
The Connecticut Citizens Defense League and gun rights advocates who support the bill say silencers exist for a purpose and the bill is about protecting that.
“I believe there has been a misconception by the public for a very long time when it comes to noise suppressors. I think a lot of people conjure up an image of a hit-man from a violent movie or television show," CCDL president Scott Wilson said in a statement to NBC Connecticut. "The reality about these devices is that they dampen the loud noise to a safer decibel level. They especially benefit shooters that train and shoot in competitive events."

“The jihadist narrative is that there is undying enmity between Islam and the modern world, so when Trump says they all hate us, he's using their narrative," Michael Hayden said during a talk at the Hay Festival, according to The Guardian.

Trump in March said that "Islam hates us" and "it's hard to separate" the religion from its radical offshoots. They have also called for a temporary ban on all Muslims coming into the country.
During the talk, Hayden also addressed Edward Snowden, saying what they did was damaging.
“The 2 percent of what Snowden revealed that had to do with privacy accelerated a necessary conversation," they said.
"The other 98 percent was about how the U.S. and foreign governments collected legitimate material … that was incredibly damaging."
They also pivoted to address a question about giving information to social media companies, such as Facebook. They were asked how much information social media companies receive and if the public should trust them more than the NSA.
“I have my views on that,” Hayden said.
“Your habits are all geared to protecting privacy against the government because that was always the traditional threat. That is no longer the pattern, it is the private sector … we are going through a cultural adjustment.
BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese dissident Yang Chunlin, who called for human rights to take precedence over the Olympic Games, has been sentenced to five years in jail on charges of inciting subversion, their family and lawyer said on Monday.

The unemployed factory worker from the northeastern city of Jiamusi in Heilongjiang province went on trial in February after they helped nearby villagers issue a petition about disputed land last year that declared: “We don't want the Olympics, we want human rights.”
Yang's sister, Yang Chunping, said on Monday the reason they were jailed was because of essays they posted online that were critical of China's parliament, the ruling Communist Party and Communism in general.
“He said he's not guilty, and they were just exercising their freedom of speech and publication. But because courts lack legitimacy they said there was no use in appealing,” they said.
Lawyer Li Fangping confirmed the sentence but said Yang Chunlin maintained their innocence.
“He believes that he's innocent,” Li said. “After the official verdict is given to us, he'll have 10 days to decide what to do. So, we hope we can sit down with them so they can make a serious decision whether to appeal or not.”
The petition touched a nerve in the Communist-run country that has been going all out to prepare for the Games. China's leadership is hoping the Games, which start in Beijing on August 8 will showcase the country's economic prosperity and social unity.
Prosecutors had said the petition stained China's international image and amounted to subversion.
During a visit to Beijing by British Foreign Secretary David Milibank in late February, China's Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi defended China's rights record.
“People in China enjoy extensive freedom of speech,” Yang told reporters. “No one will get arrested because they said that human rights are more important than the Olympics. This is impossible.
“Ask 10 people from the street to face public security officers and ask them to say ‘human rights are more important than the Olympics' 10 times or even 100 times, and I will see which security officer would put them in jail.”

Story highlights The man loses control of their car while driving down a steep driveway
A neighbor uses a ladder to help the couple off the roof
A man inside the house is unhurt
A crane is brought in to lower the car
The husband and wife left for a night on the town.
They ended up with their Cadillac on the roof a house.
In an incident that left neighbors in a Glendale, California, neighborhood surprised but relieved that no one was hurt, a man lost control of their black Cadillac as they drove down their steep driveway Saturday evening.
The car blew through a neighbor's yard, clipped a house and went airborne -- landing on the roof of a house.
Its front pointed toward the sky; its back rested on the edge of a retaining wall.
Galina Wynn told CNN affiliate KABC that their husband, Robert, couldn't stop as they turned the corner from their hillside home. There was something wrong with the car, they said.
"As soon as we hit the corner, the airbags deployed and I didn't even see where we were going from there because the view was obscured," Wynn said.
Neighbors rushed to the scene. One grabbed a ladder and helped the couple off the roof.
An 80-year-old person inside the house was startled but unhurt.
"There was one person inside the house but not in the area of where the car landed," said Glendale Fire Batt. Chief Ron Gulli.
The fire department brought in a large crane to delicately lift the car off the house.
It had major damage. The roof, on the other hand, needs only minor repairs.
"You know I've seen other similar collisions. We have a lot of hillsides here in Glendale. But this was very unique that it landed the way it did and didn't go through the roof of the home and cause some injuries," Glendale police Lt. Scott Bickle told CNN affiliate KTLA
Neighbors told officers Saturday's incident was the second time the man crashed into a neighbor's house while trying to drive down their driveway, said Glendale police Sgt. Sean Riley.
The man, in their late 60s, will need to take a driver's reevaluation test to determine if they are still able to drive safely.
There are loads of changes in Windows 8 that you've already seen — like the Start Screen, Charms Bar, ridiculously fast boot times, and a touch UX that's streets ahead of any previous Windows version. Windows 8 is also changing the PC hardware landscape, with UEFI finding its way onto mainboards and touchscreens shipping on more PCs than ever before. Some of those PCs have a hidden feature that you might not know about: a Windows 8 product key that's stored inside the firmware. Yes, Microsoft has finally given PC OEMs an alternative to slapping a license sticker on the outside of their creations.
Consumers should benefit from the change in a couple of ways. For one, having the product key stored within a computer's firmware should mean no more typing in lengthy alphanumeric sequences during a Windows reinstall. One would assume that if Microsoft is no longer providing a key, an end user can look and see that the installer has been updated to search for that key internally and proceed if the key is found.
Hopefully that holds true for upgrades, too. If you've bought a Windows 8 PC and want to move up to Windows 8 Pro, you should be able to perform the installation without hassle if your system has an integrated key.
The biggest benefit, however, could be reducing the cost of future versions of Windows. An integrated product key should make it more difficult for shady PC vendors to pilfer keys. PCs running older versions of Windows, for example, ship with a Windows product key on their cases — but are generally activated using a volume license key instead. That means the key on the side can be used to activate an entirely different system. Cutting down on the number of illegal Windows installs in the wild should allow Microsoft to reduce the amount of resources it pours into fighting piracy, and that should trickle down to consumers.
More at Ghacks
April Corcoran listens as Judge Leslie Ghiz sentences them to 51 years to life in prison. (Photo: Patrick Reddy)
CINCINNATI -- They said they were ashamed that they traded their 11-year-old daughter for sex to get heroin, but the judge pointed out that April Corcoran never offered an apology to the child.
“You showed no kind of mercy,” Judge Leslie Ghiz said.
In turn, Ghiz said she'd have no mercy on Corcoran and sentenced them to 51 years to life during their sentencing Tuesday in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court.
Corcoran, 32, of Warren County, pleaded guilty in June to multiple counts of complicity to rape, of human trafficking and child endangering involving the child. Corcoran also admitted giving the girl heroin sometimes as a reward. The child vomited each time.
Ghiz allowed Corcoran to read a statement in court.
“I made selfish, horrible choices that will affect (the girl) for the rest of their life,” Corcoran said. “I am consumed by guilt and shame every day.”
That didn't move the judge.
The girl was sodomized, raped, forced to perform oral sex and frequently videotaped by Corcoran's drug dealer in their Camp Washington home, prosecutors say. The encounters happened between February and June 2014.
Shandell Willingham, 42, who faces the same charges as Corcoran, has been convicted in Indiana on unrelated drug charges as well as on child pornography charges. They were returned to Hamilton County last month. A hearing in their case is set for Aug. 10.
The girl's grandparents told the judge they hoped for justice for their granddaughter and that others would be protected from Corcoran. The girl's grandmother spoke quietly in court.
"I saw my granddaughter. I heard their small voice," Sylvia Corcoran said. "It was horrific. How could they (Corcoran) do this? I don't know if my granddaughter is going to be able to have a normal life."
The girl, now, 13, is living out of state with their father and stepmother.
Ghiz said they had to take breaks while reading everything that was admitted into the court case.
"I can honestly say that, in three-and-a-half years on the bench, this is by far the worst thing that has come before this court," Ghiz said. And she's seen everything from thefts to physical harm done by people addicted to heroin, they said.
"I don't know that you grasp the damage that has been done to this poor child," Ghiz said, noting that the girl is undergoing medical care, has had suicidal thoughts and is taking medications.
Corcoran's lawyer, James Bogen, said their client has been "sickened and disgusted" by what she's done since she's been jailed.
Dr. Daniel Bebo of UC Health told the court that when someone's in withdrawal from opioids or heroin, “There's a lot of leeway to what they'll say or do.”
But they confirmed Bogen's statement in court about addicts: "They still know right from wrong."

“Sean, we've got to get to the bottom of it. We've got to find out whether Mr. Amiri, who was executed this last weekend, was essentially, they became public because of the revelations in Hillary Clinton's email. … It is heartbreaking to think that someone who would have cooperated, as reports indicated, with the United States and with our interests, to the security of our nation, would have lost their lives because of the recklessness and carelessness of Hillary Clinton using a private server. We don't know that that's the case, it's being reported, but we absolutely have to get to the bottom of it. The American people have a right to know.”
— GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, on the Sean Hannity radio show, Aug. 8, 2016
The Trump campaign has been asking questions about whether the execution in Iran of a former defector to the United States was related to Hillary Clinton's private email server. The insinuation is that somehow their emails led to the Iranian scientist's death. As Pence put it, they could have lost their lives “because of the recklessness and carelessness of Hillary Clinton using a private server.”
Here's a tweet from Trump, using their favorite locution (“many people are saying”) for making a claim without actually saying it himself:
Many people are saying that the Iranians killed the scientist who helped the U.S. because of Hillary Clinton's hacked emails. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 8, 2016
Truly, this is among the stupidest claims made so far in this campaign.
There's an easy way to figure this out before you make a fool of yourself on the radio or on Twitter: Simply check the newspaper clips.
We have assembled below the mentions of Shahram Amiri, the executed scientist, in The Washington Post in 2009 and 2010, and then placed the emails to Clinton in the timeline. You will note that the emails in question do not even mention their name — which appeared frequently on the front page of The Post and other newspapers at the time.
The Facts
Oct. 8, 2009: Iran Blames U.S. in Disappearance of Scientist
Iran's foreign minister on Wednesday accused the United States of being involved in the disappearance of an Iranian scientist with alleged links to Iran's nuclear program. The charge comes less than a week after Iran reached tentative accords with the United States and other major powers on addressing questions about its nuclear ambitions, including letting international inspectors visit its newly disclosed uranium-enrichment site near Qom. The charge also comes as the United States has raised questions about Americans being held in Iran. The scientist, Shahram Amiri, vanished during a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia four months ago; Iran previously called on Saudi Arabia to help locate him.  They are a researcher at Malek Ashtar University, which is connected to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and was listed by the European Union last year as an entity linked to Iran's nuclear activities or weapon delivery systems.
Dec. 15, 2009: Iran intends to go forward with espionage trial of 3 Americans
Iran also is concerned about Shahram Amiri, a nuclear physicist who disappeared in June during a pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Some media reports have said Amiri was seeking asylum abroad, but the Iranian Foreign Ministry charged that Saudi authorities handed them over to the United States and that now “he is among 11 jailed Iranians in America.”
March 31, 2010: U.S., world leaders press Iran on its nuclear program
On Tuesday, ABC News reported that U.S. officials had confirmed the defection of Iranian scientist Shahram Amiri, who vanished last summer during a pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. The report said Amiri had defected to the CIA in an “intelligence coup” and had been resettled in the United States.
April 25, 2010: Discontented Iranian officials provide wealth of intelligence
In recent weeks, U.S. officials have acknowledged that an Iranian nuclear scientist defected to the West in June. Shahram Amiri, 32, vanished while on a religious pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia and has provided spy agencies with details about sensitive programs, including a long-hidden uranium-enrichment plant near the city of Qom, intelligence officials and Europe-based diplomats said. Amiri is described by some as the most significant Iranian defector since Brig. Gen. Ali Reza Asgari, a former deputy defense minister and Revolutionary Guard Corps commander who switched sides during a 2007 trip to Turkey.
June 9, 2010: Mystery deepens over vanished Iranian scientist
The apparent defection last year of an Iranian nuclear scientist with a presumed trove of secrets was hailed by U.S. officials as an “intelligence coup.” Yet here was the same scientist appearing in a crude video this week saying they had been abducted and tortured. And then popping up in a second video, retracting the story.
July 5, 2010: email sent by Richard Morningstar, State Department special envoy for Eurasian energy, forwarded to Clinton
“Per the subject we discussed, we have a diplomatic, ‘psychological' issue, not a legal issue. Our friend has to be given a way out. We should recognize their concerns and frame it in terms of a misunderstanding with no malevolent intent and that we will make sure there is no recurrence. Our person won't be able to do anything anyway. If they have to leave so be it.”
July 5, 2010 Email by GlennKesslerWP on Scribd
July 12, 2010: email sent to Clinton by deputy chief of staff Jake Sullivan
“The gentleman … has apparently gone to their country's interests section because they are unhappy with how much time it has taken to facilitate their departure. This could lead to problematic news stories in the next 24 hours.”
July 12, 2010 Email by GlennKesslerWP on Scribd
July 13, 2010: Clinton answers a question from a reporter about Amiri
“Mr. Amiri has been in the United States of their own free will and they are free to go. In fact, they were scheduled to travel to Iran yesterday but was unable to make all of the necessary arrangements to reach Iran through transit countries. … He's free to go. They were free to come. These decisions are theirs alone to make.”
July 14, 2010: Iranian scientist heads homeward in anger
An Iranian nuclear scientist who had disappeared in Saudi Arabia last summer stepped out of a cab in front of Iran's diplomatic mission in Washington on Monday, asking for a ticket back to their homeland. Shahram Amiri told officials that they had been abducted by U.S. intelligence operatives and had spent much of the past year in Tucson being questioned about Iran's nuclear ambitions.
July 15, 2010: U.S. paid $5 million to Iranian scientist
The Iranian nuclear scientist who claimed to have been abducted by the CIA before departing for their homeland Wednesday was paid more than $5 million by the agency to provide intelligence on Iran's nuclear program, U.S. officials said. Shahram Amiri is not obligated to return the money but might be unable to access it after breaking off what U.S. officials described as significant cooperation with the CIA and abruptly returning to Iran. Officials said they might have left out of concern that the Tehran government would harm their family.
The Pinocchio Test
As can be seen with this timeline of newspaper articles, the defection and then return of Amiri was widely covered in the news media in 2009 and 2010. Iranian officials could have learned everything they needed to know about Amiri's defection from reading The Post. Moreover, Iran first publicly raised questions about their disappearance. There was little to be learned from the cryptic messages in Clinton's emails, even if Iran had somehow gained access to Clinton's server.
Mystery solved! And four more Pinocchios for Donald Trump.

While much of the world has been preoccupied with questions about a no-fly zone over Libya, Arab Gulf states have been busy establishing what might be called a "no-protest zone" in the Arabian peninsula.
Last week Saudi Arabia took an uncompromising stand against demonstrations on its own territory, declaring them both illegal and un-Islamic. Then, on Monday, it sent troops into Bahrain to assist the regime in quelling protesters there. The Saudis justified their action under a security agreement dating back to the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s and known as Peninsula Shield.
This agreement, which involves the six Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries (Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, Oman, Kuwait and Qatar), resulted in the creation of a joint military force intended to protect its members against external threats. As a communique from the GCC interior ministers put it in 1982: "Any aggression on a member state is aggression against the other states, and facing aggression is considered a joint responsibility."
The statement added: "Interference from any entity in the internal affairs of one of the member states is interference in the internal affairs of all the nations of the council."
There was no suggestion at the time that Peninsula Shield forces would be used to protect unrepresentative Gulf regimes from "aggression" or "interference" by their own citizens – and yet this is what has now happened.
Although Saudi Arabia's Peninsula Shield forces appear not to have directly attacked demonstrators in Bahrain – they are supposedly there to protect key parts of the infrastructure – their presence at the very least facilitates the suppression by relieving Bahraini forces of other duties.
Trying to justify this under the terms of Peninsula Shield is certainly ironic, considering that interference in the internal affairs of member states is one of the things the force was set up to guard against, but it becomes a little easier if the Bahraini protesters are characterised as agents of a common enemy: Iran. That can only be achieved by treating the protests as fundamentally sectarian – Shia versus Sunni rather than people versus government.
Religious differences clearly play a big part in Bahrain. After all, the kingdom has a Shia majority ruled by a Sunni minority. Shia Muslims account for most of the protesters, partly because they are the majority and also because they have more to complain about. But, as Bahraini commentator Tahiyya Lulu has pointed out in a couple of recent articles, the pro-reform demonstrators cover a wide spectrum that transcends the sectarian divide.
The effect of the Saudi intervention is to sectarianise the conflict more than it need have been and, in effect, to prevent any accommodation between the rulers of Bahrain and the protesters.
"We're not going in [to Bahrain] to shoot people, we're going in to keep a system in place," a Saudi official was quoted as saying in the Washington Post. An official from the UAE put it even more bluntly: "We and the Saudis will not accept a Shi'ite government in Bahrain."
In other words, as far as the GCC countries are concerned, democracy or majority rule can never be allowed there.
This is unbelievably short-sighted. The majority of Bahrain's population cannot be kept marginalised for ever, and the sooner change gets under way the better it will be for everyone. Instead, the regime is being pushed into an intransigent stance which, in the longer term, may well seal its fate.
The Saudis, meanwhile, continue to store up trouble for themselves in their treatment of the Shia communities back home.
Unsurprisingly, the US has been less critical of all this than it has been in relation to Gaddafi's behaviour in Libya, though on Wednesday secretary of state Hillary Clinton came out with their strongest comments so far, saying that Bahrain is on "the wrong track".
"With the Gulf countries, we've made it very clear that there cannot be a security answer to what are legitimate political questions," they said.
As always, the US continues to fret about stability among its allies but increasingly it seems to be recognising – unlike Gulf rulers themselves – that radical change is inevitable and that the wisest course is not to stand in its way but to try to minimise the turmoil when it happens.
A little name recognition can't hurt.
It will take more than the fact that they are the younger brother of an NFL MVP, however, for Jordan Rodgers to earn a job with the British Columbia Lions of the Canadian Football League.
Rodgers, a former Vanderbilt quarterback, is one of five currently competing to be that team's backup. The starter is Travis Lulay, who has led a team to the Grey Cup and been named the CFL's Most Outstanding Player, but there is opportunity behind him.
"I've been with a lot of teams and I've been at a lot of levels with a lot of guys," Rodgers said, according to BoxscoreNews.com. "I think leadership is a thing I bring to the table.
"I'm able to lead guys and I think I have that swagger, that chip that a quarterback needs to be successful."
Rodgers was Vanderbilt's starting quarterback in 2011 and 2012 and then tried to make it in the NFL as an undrafted free agent. They spent time with Jacksonville, Tampa Bay and Miami but the Dolphins released them prior to training camp last summer and they were out of a job.
British Columbia signed them last October, when the CFL allows for expanded rosters. They did not play in a game but got a sense of the differences between the American and Canadian games.
"It's becoming more of a second nature, and it was good to have the offseason to get the receivers to practice those routes and really study the game a little more," Rodgers said.
Of course, it can't hurt that the Lions' first-year coach is Jeff Tedford, a former head coach at Cal and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive coordinator last season. At Cal, Tedford helped develop Rodgers' brother Aaron into a first-round draft pick.
"It's good to have a brand-new offense, and me, I didn't get too engrained with the offense last year only being here for a few weeks," Rodgers said. "I'm starting fresh - everyone's starting fresh and it's a good opportunity."
The CFL regular season begins the last week in June and British Columbia's opener is July 4.

Amazon Web Services recently hosted Database Architecture Week at the AWS San Francisco Pop-Up Loft. Guests learned how to implement AWS tools and were also introduced to MongoDB Atlas in a session that I led. Distributed database systems and the underlying architectures they use was the hot topic, which meant I was extremely fortunate to get the invitation to talk with everyone about MongoDB Atlas.
![](https://webassets.mongodb.com/_com_assets/cms/AWS_MongoDBAtlas_Blog-ftats639n9.png)
First of all, the space was amazing; the AWS team has put together an incredible aesthetic — everything from the copy of The Beatles Abbey Road on the wall to the giant CODE HAPPY sign.
![](https://webassets.mongodb.com/_com_assets/cms/AWS_MongoDBAtlas_2-a0bbwdmi7a.png)
Some of the attendees already had some prior knowledge or exposure to MongoDB, but during the 20 minutes or so that I presented, I was able to explain the explosion in popularity of the database amongst developers and ops professionals. Developers love discussing their software and achievements. When you review this graphic below, it's evident how much people love discussing MongoDB and the projects they'll be built with it. When you consider other major players who have been building databases for nearly 20+ years, it's quite spectacular how many people are putting their trust in MongoDB.
![](https://webassets.mongodb.com/_com_assets/cms/MongoDBAtlas_Growing_Database-ctimn9p9zm.png)
After giving a brief explanation on our rich query language, document flexibility and aggregation framework, I spoke about MongoDB Atlas, which was easily the star of the discussion. MongoDB Atlas is our fully managed database as a service platform that provides users with an easy way to start building apps with a fast, secure, and redundant database system; great for both rookies and veterans of MongoDB.
One of the key points of the discussion explained how many organizations no longer want to focus their energies on hardware acquisition and implementation. Because of cloud technologies like MongoDB Atlas, operational burdens are greatly reduced, allowing you to spend more time on building software and less time on keeping the lights on, so to speak.
![](https://webassets.mongodb.com/_com_assets/cms/AWS_Loft_MongoDB_Atlas3-anwwqrqup3.png)
My favorite parts of presenting are always the Q&A and being able to people 1-on-1. One of my favorite conversations came from a developer who asked me, "How do you get people to learn more about your software?" We talked about MongoDB University and all the free courses we've made available to our users. I also discussed some personal experiences where I've used MongoDB to find ways to learn new things about myself. I explained how I was able to take my Twitter account, export the data provided into a CSV, and import all of it directly into MongoDB Atlas. I got to query on certain subjects using the aggregation framework and found some moments in time I wished I could relive. One developer really appreciated this idea and mentioned that they were going to introduce it to a nephew who's currently a computer science student.
![](https://webassets.mongodb.com/_com_assets/cms/MongoDBAtlas_AWSLoft-lj9ueqs9eh.png)
As the evening came to a close, it was time for me to head out, but not before I gave out some Rubik's Cubes and MongoDB Atlas credits! I had a few more conversations with some brilliant people, including a woman who wanted to attend our MongoDB World in Chicago this year to further their knowledge and meet others building new and huge things. Hope to see them there!
My next stop — AWS re:Invent in Las Vegas.
Join me there and we can chat about MongoDB Atlas and the incredible things people are building with it.

Former Arizona Wildcat Stanley Johnson successfully stood out in the Orlando NBA Summer League, and they took time out after playing in The Drew League to talk to ZonaZealots.
All of Stanley Johnson‘s hard work this summer is paying off. They had a successful Summer League Performance scoring more than all of their other six former Wildcats, is playing in The Drew League and working out with Team USA in Vegas this week.
The fans that came to take in their exhilarating playing and dunking abilities got what they came for, witnessing their grace and power on the basketball court. Johnson was responsible for bringing their team back from a double-digit deficit several times driving the basket and drawing fouls. We don't remember them every sitting, they played the entire game and racked up 46 Points, 27 just in the first half!!
The Detroit Pistons spectacular Drew League highest scoring performance this season wasn't enough for their ICEO team to beat Hank's Clozers 97-82. Who plays for Hank's Clozers you're wondering? Two USC stars: Bennie Boatwright, who scored 28 points and Chimezie Metu, who scored 17 points and grabbed 13 rebounds.
Stanley Johnson isn't happy with losing, in any way, shape or form, and they aren't happy after losing the game they had just played. Last week Johnson played alongside their Pistons teammate Andre Drummond, 22, who just inked a five-year max deal worth around $130 million. This proves the Pistons are willing to pay for their talent they want to keep, and Stanley only just turned 20, so their hard work could literally pay off.
Even though they were bummed out about losing, they were still their gracious self and agreed to talk to me and my co-host Chris Camello on our In The Front Row sports variety show. Both Chris and I met while covering and writing about the Los Angeles Lakers and D-Fenders. A few D-Fenders and a couple of Lakers also play in the Drew. Along with Johnson and Drummond, The Drew League has attracted other NBA players such as Metta World Peace, Dorell Wright, Nick Young, James Harden, and JaVale McGee.
Here is the In The Front Row interview where LA Dodgers fan Stanley gives some great insights into their attitude, their upcoming summer camp, playing against LeBron James and working towards next season:

We want to thank Stanely for their time, and we wish them great things to come in the NBA and life. BearDown Stanimal! We couldn't be prouder.
Black Jesus may play like straight-up parody, but it's a comedy series that speaks directly to modern social controversy.
This past weekend, an otherwise average American town -- in Missouri, specifically -- looked for all the world like a dispatch from the Gaza Strip as a local police force rolled out enough hardware to cut a promo for the next Call of Duty against the town's own citizenry, who had assembled in public protest over the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager by that same police department the previous week. It did not go well.
In the discussion surrounding the events, a narrative emerged in the media of a conflict over "depictions" of the shooting victim by the opposing "sides" of the debate in the press. On the protests' side, white-hot outrage at the police for releasing a video showing a man who may have been the victim committing an act of petty theft entirely unconnected to the shooting. On the other side, anger at the protesters (and their supporters in the press) for that outrage, and the renewal of ancient talking-points about the tendency to use well-composed family snapshots or graduation photos as the "default image" of such victims rather than "what they really looked like" (see: it somehow being relevant that murdered teenager Trayvon Martin had at some point worn gold teeth) -- as though the Liberal Media Boogeyman was covering up some incontrovertible proof that young black men really are just inherently scary enough for it to be justifiable (or "understandable") that panicky cops (or neighborhood watch vigilantes) might be scared enough to draw their guns and open fire as though The Predator was bearing down on them.
It's typical for that second group to refer to the "misleading" friendly images in spiritual terms for maximum "satirical" effect: "They tried to make them look like a cherub. A little angel. A saint." So it almost feels like something more than eerie happenstance that an accidentally-perfect parody (by exaggeration) of that innate absurdity -- bigots tacitly admitting through projection that young black men from the inner city would practically have to be Christ Himself to earn the benefit of their doubt -- emerged onto Adult Swim a week before any of this went down in the form of Black Jesus, a comedy series about the daily life of a young black man coping with (among other things) unfriendly police attention in poverty-stricken Compton, California... who just so happens to actually be Jesus Christ.

Belgium: Travel warnings for Irish tourists as terrorist attack deemed 'possible and likely'
Irish citizens are now advised to "exercise caution" in the country.
"People travelling to Belgium are advised to be vigilant and to follow the advice of the Belgian authorities," the DFA now states in its travel advice.
The UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) has also updated its travel advice, indicating that a terrorist attack is "possible and likely" in Belgium.
The changes come as Belgium increased its national threat level to 'serious' following the Paris attacks and a series of related raids in Brussels.
Belgian soldiers have been deployed to aid police, while security has been escalated along the border with France, as well as at airports, international train stations and key buildings such as EU institutions in Brussels.
An international football friendly between Belgium and Spain was suspended Tuesday night, though next week's Davis Cup tennis final - featuring Great Britain and Belgium - is set to go ahead as planned in Ghent.
The change in its travel advice means Belgium is now accorded the same security status as Russia, Iran, Turkey, Serbia and Albania by the Department of Foreign Affairs.
The Belgian Embassy in Dublin declined to comment.
"These travel advisories are in line with our own advice to our nationals and our travel advice for Belgians travelling to France," José de Pierpont, Deputy spokesperson at the Belgian Foreign Ministry, told Independent.ie.
Roughly 7.5 million tourists visit Belgium every year, according to The World Bank.
Meanwhile, the Department of Foreign Affairs is advising Irish citizens to "exercise extreme caution" in France following this weekend's Paris attacks.
UPDATE: Since this story was published, the DFA has raised its security status for Belgium to 'exercise extreme caution'.

An activist group called Plataforma Stop Uranio (Stop Uranium Platform) is calling for a protest action to be held on October 30, 2016 in the town of Retortillo, located in Spain's western province of Salamanca.
According to La Vanguardia newspaper, the group opposes the development of Berkeley Resources' Retortillo mine, which is part of the company's flagship Salamanca uranium project.
Activists are planning to gather at the company's headquarters with the idea of expressing their disapproval towards the open-pit project which, they say, would affect nearby farms and hot springs, as well as residents' health.
“The worst part is the environmental damage that's being caused in the area, which has been declared a protected Red Natura 2000 zone by Castilla and León authorities. Centenary oaks are being uprooted in order to build a road, despite the miner's promise to transplant them,” their statement reads.
Tensions have been boiling over since October 18, 2016, when the City of Retortillo declared a couple of members from the Stop Uranium Platform as personas non gratas, due to their activities against the mine.
Also last week, the Portuguese group Os Verdes de Portugal (Portugal's Greens) held public assemblies to discuss the possible effects of the Salamanca uranium project in the bordering municipalities of Guarda and Freixo de Espada a Cinta.
Together with representatives from the Stop Uranium Platform, Os Verdes de Portugal expressed concerns about the consequences of radioactive resource exploitation for the Yeltes and Douro rivers, which support farming operations in the area.
The Retortillo-Santidad uranium deposit is expected to produce an average of 4.4 million pounds of uranium per year. Berkeley's mining licence for the site is valid for an initial period of 30 years, renewable for two further periods of 30 years.
The Australian company states on its website that it has developed “a good neighbour and business partner relationship with the local community.” Nevertheless, according to the local press, people from adjacent towns seem to be divided in terms of their support towards the project.
In an email statement in response to this story, Berkeley Energia's Managing Director, Paul Atherley said: “Berkeley has invested US$60m in the last 10 years in the development of what will be Europe's largest producer of uranium, the fuel required for nuclear energy, the most efficient low carbon generator of electricity in the world.
The Salamanca Project will provide over 450 direct and 2,000 indirect jobs in an area, which has seen crippling unemployment following the ceasing of previous mining activities, and adheres to the highest EU environmental and safety standards, regarded as the most rigorous in the world.
The mine has overwhelming support from not only the EU, as nuclear energy provides over half of the continent's low-carbon electricity, but also from local and regional communities which all recognise the strategic importance of a world class project being built in the Salamanca region. The project has the opportunity of putting Salamanca on the map as one of the most important, modern and sustainable uranium producers in the world, providing a win/win for jobs and the Spanish economy, and the future for European low carbon power generation."
Here is a look at five key positions for the Seahawks as they enter free agency this week, and what the team may do at each one.
Here are five positions of need for the Seahawks entering free agency — the NFL's signing period begins at 1 p.m. Wednesday Seattle time — and some players who might be a good fit:
OFFENSIVE LINE
Overview: The need at this position can be subjective. Some fans might be wishing for a complete makeover. But coach Pete Carroll and general manager John Schneider spoke at the NFL combine about the growth of the line as the season progressed. Schneider also made intriguing comments about what they see as a growing challenge for all NFL teams to find offensive linemen due in part to the growth of spread offenses. There seemed to also be a hint hidden in there that Schneider isn't seeing a lot of quick fixes in the draft or free agency.
The Seahawks first must find out if they will lose left tackle Russell Okung and right guard J.R. Sweezy. If so, the Seahawks first would look to replace those two. Okung is representing himself, which makes their situation difficult to read. As for Sweezy, one report Monday morning had more than 10 teams showing interest in him, including teams with coaches who know them well such as Atlanta and Jacksonville.
Possible free agent fits: How the Seahawks address the left-tackle spot if Okung departs might be the biggest question in the offseason. If Okung departs, they could spend big to replace him, though probably not enough to land Kelechi Osemele of Baltimore, who some think could get $11 million plus per year. Maybe more realistic is Oakland's Donald Penn, who could maybe be had for $4 million or $5 million per year. Another possibility if Okung and or Sweezy departs is to move Justin Britt back to right tackle, Garry Gilliam to left tackle and find another guard. One possibility: Denver's Evan Mathis, who visited the Seahawks last year before signing a one-year deal with the Broncos. Alex Mack of Cleveland remains the big name at center, but lots of early conjecture has them potentially landing back with Cleveland or possibly going to cash-to-burn Jacksonville.
DEFENSIVE TACKLE
Overview: Ahtyba Rubin agreed to a three-year contract Monday night, and the other starting tackle — Brandon Mebane — is a free agent. The Seahawks might try to re-sign Mebane and go to other options if they get away. It's regarded as an especially strong year in the draft for tackles, but the Seahawks are unlikely to depend on that solely.
Possible fits: Should Mebane leave and the Seahawks want to splurge, they could go after Ian Williams of the 49ers. If they go for a veteran on a shorter/cheaper contract, they could look to 32-year-old Haloti Ngata of the Lions. Three former Seahawks also are back on the market — Tony McDaniel, Kevin Williams and Jaye Howard, though the latter likely will get a significant contract.
CORNERBACK
Overview: Jeremy Lane is an unrestricted free agent, and if they sign elsewhere the Seahawks could be in the market for a veteran.
Possible fits: The Seahawks have not had great luck with veteran free agents the past few years (Antoine Winfield in 2013 and Cary Williams in 2015). Some think it might be tough for experienced players to adapt to the Seahawks' style of play (specifically, the step-kick technique they employ, which is not used by everyone and was a challenge for Williams). So the Seahawks might tread lightly in free agency for a cornerback if the need arises.
One player who might not be overly expensive is Arizona's Jerraud Powers, who turns 29 in July and has started 40 games for the Cardinals the past three years. A relatively cheaper move such as that would seem to make more sense, also because the Seahawks already have so much invested in the secondary in Richard Sherman, Earl Thomas and Kam Chancellor.
LINEBACKER
Overview: The Seahawks likely will lose strong-side linebacker Bruce Irvin, who could sign quickly when the signing period begins Wednesday. Atlanta and Jacksonville have long been regarded as the teams most likely to make a run at him.
Possible free agent fits: Irvin served something of a hybrid role as a linebacker on running downs and an edge rusher on passing downs, and the Seahawks could mix and match players to replace their production. One player who has a similar skill set and familiarity with how they do things is Nick Perry, who played for Carroll at USC. Perry, though, might not come with much less of a price than Irvin, though their injury history could scare some teams. Another Packers outside linebacker, Mike Neal, figure to be cheaper.
RUNNING BACK
Overview: Marshawn Lynch has retired, and though the Seahawks have Thomas Rawls ready to take over a starting role, they will want depth behind Rawls and someone who can step in as a full-time back if needed.
Possible fits: Lynch still counts $5 million against the Seahawks' salary cap in 2016, and they don't figure to spend big on a tailback, which might price out big-named vets such as Matt Forte and Arian Foster. One veteran who would be more of a bargain and would be a good fit in the third-down back role is James Stark, who caught 43 passes last year for Green Bay and rushed for 601 yards. And one intriguing name could possibly be had for the veteran minimum — former Washington Husky Chris Polk. The Seahawks were interested in Polk a year ago before they signed with Houston. The two teams were said to be their final two choices before signed with the Texans.
DEFIANCE, OH — Eighties-era rock legend Meat Loaf surprised the crowd of 10,000 voters gathered for a Mitt Romney rally here Thursday night when they took the stage to play a couple songs, endorse the Republican nominee — and offer their views on Russia's geopolitical threat.
"I think that in 2012, this is the most important election in the history of the United States," said Meat Loaf, singer of the hit power ballad, I Would Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That). "Because there has storm clouds come over the United States. There is thunderstorms over Europe. There are hail storms, and I mean major hail storms, in the Middle East. There are storms brewing through China, through Asia, through everywhere."
They went on, "And there's only one man that on the other night when Pres. Barack Obama, God bless him, said to Mitt Romney, 'The Cold War is over.' I have never heard such a thing in my life. The man needs to understand Putin and Russia."
Romney has stressed the need for tougher diplomacy with Russia throughout the campaign, an emphasis President Obama mocked in Monday's foreign policy debate.
Still, Meat Loaf said Romney's rhetoric has inspired him, and even led them to call three friends in California and try to talk them into voting for theirs guy.
"I got two of them to switch to Romney, so two out of three ain't bad!" intoned Meat Loaf, wearing black sequen sleeves and a red-and-black cape.
After the rally, Meat Loaf joined Romney on stage along with country singers Randy Owen and John Rich, and the four men led the crowd in a rendition of America, the Beautiful.
Liverpool remains in the hunt to sign Southampton defender Virgil van Dijk.
Chelsea are expected to make a £60million offer for the Holland international to prompt negotiations with the south coast club, however, the 25-year-old is still keen on a move to Anfield.
Southampton lodged a complaint against Liverpool over their pursuit of Van Dijk which was alleged to have resulted with Jurgen Klopp meeting the player in a Blackpool hotel.
Virgil van Dijk still favours a move to Liverpool but Chelsea are set to bid £60m
It prompted a warning from the Premier League and an unprecedented apology from the Anfield club who said their interest in the player had ended.
Yet it is understood Chelsea are wary that Van Dijk still harbours a desire to move to Liverpool should they leave this summer.
Chelsea will sign Tiemoue Bakayoko from Monaco for £35.2m and are making an improved bid for Juventus left-back Alex Sandro.
The Southampton man is a target in defence for Chelsea in addition to Leonardo Bonucci
Their Juventus team-mate Leonardo Bonucci is also on Antonio Conte's wishlist while Bayern Munich's Jerome Boateng has also been discussed.
Chelsea though will have to offload a defender in the process with question marks over the futures of Nathan Ake, Andreas Christensen and Kurt Zouma.
The young trio all want regular football and have interest from other Premier League and European sides.

Hanoi's municipal government has rejected a plan by Vietnam's culture ministry to erect a "life-size" King Kong statue by an iconic lake in the city.
The ministry hoped the model would tap into the popularity of recently released blockbuster Kong: Skull Island, which was partly filmed in Vietnam, and give tourists a new photo opportunity in the capital. It had planned to position the statue at Hanoi's Hoan Kiem Lake, a focal point of city life, but that plan didn't impress local officials.
Hanoi authorities say the lake is an important national heritage site, and any King Kong statue would have to be well away from it, the Tuoi Tre newspaper reports. "We have consulted with experts and found that the majority of them objected to the idea," says Truong Minh Tien, deputy director of Hanoi's culture department.
The lake has several historical monuments around it and is also at the centre of a Vietnamese legend, and the proposed site was close to a war memorial.
There's no indication how tall the model ape would have been, but Tuoi Tre says the ministry was keen for it to be "life size". Kong in Skull Island is 100ft (30.5m) tall, according to the film's producers.
This isn't the first King Kong statue to run into trouble in Vietnam. At the film's premiere earlier this month, a huge statue of the ape went up in flames after being ignited by a nearby model volcano. The blaze sparked panic in the crowd, but nobody was injured.

Iran is continuing to develop missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons despite an interim agreement on its nuclear programs, according to a Pentagon report.
"Although Iran has paused progress in some areas of its nuclear program and fulfilled its obligations under the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA), it continues to develop technological capabilities that also could be applicable to nuclear weapons, including ballistic missile development," a one-page unclassified summary of the report says.
A copy of the report was obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.
The report was due to Congress in January but was not sent to the Armed Services Committee as required by law until this month. Analysts said the delay appeared designed to avoid upsetting Tehran and the nuclear talks.
Disclosure of the continuing development of nuclear delivery capabilities comes amid reports that Iran increased the amount of nuclear material that could potentially be used to build nuclear weapons despite the JPOA.
The State Department sought to challenge International Atomic Energy Agency reports on the increase in Iranian nuclear material, despite President Obama's claim that the nuclear agreement had halted Iran's nuclear program.
State Department spokesperson Marie Harf said this week that the increase in nuclear production was expected and that the amount has increased and decreased.
Iran's military also continues to threaten the strategic Strait of Hormuz, the Pentagon report said.
"Iran continues to develop its capabilities to control the Strait of Hormuz and avenues of approach in the event of a military conflict," the report said, adding that Tehran is "quietly fielding increasingly lethal weapon systems, including more advanced naval mines, small but capable submarines, armed unmanned aerial vehicles, coastal defense cruise missile batteries, attack craft, and ant ship-capable missiles."
U.S. officials said Iranian backing for Houthi rebels in Yemen is also aimed at gaining access to the strategic Red Sea strait called the Bab-el-Mandeb, which, like the Strait of Hormuz, could be used by Iran to disrupt oil and other shipping.
Tehran's support for terrorism also has not stopped, according to the Pentagon.
"Iran's covert activities appear to be continuing unabated," the report says. "The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) remains a key tool of lran's foreign policy and power projection, particularly in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Bahrain, and Yemen."
The IRGC Quds Force also is continuing to improve its access within foreign countries and its ability to carry terrorist attacks "to safeguard or advance Iran's interests," the report said.
U.S. officials disclosed to the Free Beacon last week that Iran is increasing the number of Quds Force fighters and Lebanese Hezbollah militants it is sending to Yemen, to support pro-Iran Houthi rebels there.
The report asserts that Iran's military doctrine is "primarily defensive" and seeks to insulate Iran from more aggressive Iranian policies involving covert action and terrorism.
Iranian military forces seek to deter attacks, survive initial strikes, and retaliate against aggressors.
"The ongoing civil war in Syria and the instability in Iraq have tested, but not fundamentally altered, this posture," the report said. "Meanwhile, over the past year, the tone of publicity surrounding major military exercises has remained tempered, a trend that began in 2013, probably in support of negotiations over Iran's nuclear activities."
Iranian forces have been working with Iraq's government to battle Islamic State forces that have taken over large portions of that Middle East state. They have included IRGC fighters.
The report, dated January 2015, concludes that Iran has not substantively altered its military and security strategies in the past year.
"However, Tehran has adjusted its approach to achieve its enduring objectives, by increasing its diplomatic outreach and decreasing its bellicose rhetoric," the report said.
President Hassan Ruohani has sought to project a global message of "moderation and pragmatism" in support of those objectives.
Also, Iran is seeking to become the dominant regional power and in pursuit of that aim has "unwaveringly sought to improve its deterrent capabilities and increase its regional influence."
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who is thought to be ill, "remains atop Iran's power structure as both the political-spiritual guide and the commander in chief of the armed forces."
The Senate Armed Services Committee, in its report on the fiscal 2016 defense authorization bill passed May 19, expressed concerns about the annual report on Iran's military.
The report was due to Congress on Jan. 30 but said as of May it had not been provided.
"The committee remains concerned about the threat posed by Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile development programs," the report said.
Last year Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified that Iran "would choose a ballistic missile as its preferred method of delivering nuclear weapons." And in February, Iran launched a Safir long-range missile system.
"In 2013, the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) made the following statement about this system: Iran could develop and test an ICBM capable of reaching the United States by 2015," the report said.
"Since 2008, Iran has conducted multiple successful launches of the two-stage Safir space launch vehicle (SLV) and has also revealed the larger two stage Simorgh SLV, which could serve as a test bed for developing ICBM technologies."
The committee asked the secretary of defense to provide an update on Iran's ballistic missile programs.
As a result of the delay in the annual Iran military power report, the committee directed the Pentagon to provide a briefing on the Iranian missile threat, and to update the January report.
Ilan Berman, an Iran specialist with the American Foreign Policy Council, said the release of the report is good news but "has long been conspicuous by its absence."
"The study is long overdue, and its delay suggests that the administration has been leery of injecting inconvenient facts into the Iran debate as it closes in on a nuclear deal with the regime in Tehran," Berman said.
"The findings of the report confirm that Iran's destructive regional activities have not abated over the past year," they added.
"If anything, they have increased despite Iran's dialogue with the West," Berman said. "The product can be seen in the battlefield victories of Yemen's Iran-supported Houthi rebels, of the persistence of the Assad regime in Syria, and of the growing profile and capabilities of Iraq's Shi'a militias."
"Iran's activities represent a significant challenge to peace and security in the Middle East," they said.
"The real question is what, if anything, the White House is prepared to do about it?" they said.
Mark Dubowitz, another Iran expert, said Tehran is continuing to develop long-range ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads, in violation of U.N. Security Council limits.
"The Obama administration ceded to Iranian demands that their missile program was non-negotiable and, instead, has tried to reassure Congress that this missile threat can be mitigated by constraining Iran's ability to develop a nuclear warhead," said Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.
"This major administration concession to Iran will greatly complicate the U.S. intelligence community's ability to detect whether Iran has developed a nuclear warhead-carrying ICBM capable of reaching the continental United States," they added. "By its very nature, it is much more difficult to detect and prevent warhead development, which can take place in small, covert facilities, than it is to determine the nature and extent of a hostile missile program. In yet another example of how deeply flawed the emerging Iran deal will be, Tehran will have a much easier pathway to develop systems."
Archaeologists from the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, have unearthed part of a “lost” famine village, known as “Poirtins”, on the island of Inishbofin, of the Galway coast.
A team of ten archaeologists have spent a month working on the island. Their focus has been on 14 hours at the southeast corner of “Poirtins”, named after a little port, the Irish Times reports.
Connemara historian and archaeologist Michael Gibbons paid tribute to the American team's work and says that their discovery and said it is new to archaeology.
The experts believe that up to 100 people inhabited the village, made up of large, long, single-storey thatched house. They also found porcelain on the site. The structure of the buildings also shows that these homes were “successful residents” for the time, according to Dr Ian Kuijt, professor of anthropology at the University of Notre Dame, who led the project with their wife Meredith Chesson.
Gibbons told the Times, “The monumental type of architecture was unusual, and the settlement was not marked on the 1776 map of Inishbofin which shows houses further to the north.”
The Notre Dame team believe that the settlement was just 20 or 30 years old before it was abandoned.
Kuijt said the downturn in fishing, or the tenant farmers could have been factors in its demise. However, another theory is that at this time 1822 the population was struck by a famine. In the local cemetery there is a memorial slab dedicated to a priest who ministered to people dying of starvation and fever at that time. The stone from the buildings was taken and used for road building and other relief work elsewhere.
The Indiana group has been working on Inishbofin and Inishark since 2006, part of a project on cultural landscapes on the Irish coast.

Have you always wanted to contribute to an emulator? mGBA has reached a point where it is looking for more developers to help with the creation of the next generation Game Boy Advance emulator. As the scope of the project has expanded, the number of potential tasks to make it great has expanded, giving room for new developers to help. If you'd like to help, there are quite a few areas that are open.
The project is looking for developers to help in the following areas:
Qt frontend developers The primary frontend for mGBA is written in Qt 5, and there are a lot of cool features in the pipeline that would make mGBA really stand out, such as the advanced debugging interface, and the library view.
Windows developers and testers One of the largest pain points at the moment is the somewhat lackluster Windows support mGBA, with issues such as odd timing glitches. Developers experienced with things like WASAPI and Windows debugging, as well as being comfortable using MinGW-w64, are very valuable to the project at this point.
Low-level developers Although mGBA is already quite fast, there are a few features it could use to be even faster, including dynamic recompilers for ARM and MIPS, as well as hardware-accelerated rendering. If you're willing to get your hands dirty with assembly, mGBA could use you.
Android developers Fact: Android users love emulators. mGBA has some rudimentary work towards an Android version, but at the moment it's very raw. Getting an Android developer or two to help with the preliminary version would be much appreciated.
Skilled debuggers Like all software, mGBA is not without its share of bugs. Although the core emulation has very few known bugs at the moment, they do exist. The GUI, too, has a backlog of things to fix. If you know your way around gdb or lldb, now's your time to shine.
Lots of other things, too! mGBA has a lot going on that could use improvement, and tons of features planned. Some of the more fun ones include more link modes, such as with Dolphin or over the network, and scripting support so you can make your own Twitch Plays game, so if you have something you think you could contribute, please get in contact or file a pull request!
If you're interested in getting involved, there are many ways to start. If you already have something you want to contribute, just fork the repository on GitHub and file a pull request with your improvements. There are also forums and an IRC channel (#mgba on FreeNode) that you can use to get in contact. A tentative list of tasks is posted on the forums, and there are also two bug trackers, one on GitHub and one using Bugzilla, so take your pick and start working on something. Make sure to read the contributing guidelines before doing too much, and getting in touch to announce you're working on something is a good idea, too.
Pull requests are welcome and encouraged now, so if you want to help, please do!
WASHINGTON — Russian submarines and spy ships are aggressively operating near the vital undersea cables that carry almost all global Internet communications, raising concerns among some American military and intelligence officials that the Russians might be planning to attack those lines in times of tension or conflict.
The issue goes beyond old worries during the Cold War that the Russians would tap into the cables — a task American intelligence agencies also mastered decades ago. The alarm today is deeper: The ultimate Russian hack on the United States could involve severing the fiber-optic cables at some of their hardest-to-access locations to halt the instant communications on which the West's governments, economies and citizens have grown dependent.
While there is no evidence yet of any cable cutting, the concern is part of a growing wariness among senior American and allied military and intelligence officials over the accelerated activity by Russian armed forces around the globe. At the same time, the internal debate in Washington illustrates how the United States is increasingly viewing every Russian move through a lens of deep distrust, reminiscent of relations during the Cold War.
Inside the Pentagon and the nation's spy agencies, the assessments of Russia's growing naval activities are highly classified and not publicly discussed in detail. American officials are secretive about what they are doing both to monitor the activity and to find ways to recover quickly if cables are cut. But more than a dozen officials confirmed in broad terms that it had become the source of significant attention in the Pentagon.
This afternoon, the Obama campaign released its latest ad from a celebrity. This one was from Lena Dunham, 26-year-old creator of HBO's raunchy series Girls. It's an astoundingly tasteless ad comparing voting for the first time to losing your virginity. Really. And Dunham recommends that if you're going to have sex – er, vote – for the first time, you should really do it with President Barack Obama. Here's the transcript:
Your first time shouldn't be with just anybody. You want to do it with a great guy. It should be with a guy with beautiful … somebody who really cares about and understands women.
A guy who cares about whether you get health insurance, and specifically whether you get birth control. The consequences are huge. You want to do it with a guy who brought the troops out of Iraq. You don't want a guy who says, “Oh hey, I'm at the library studying,” when he's really out not signing the Lilly Ledbetter Act.
Or who thinks that gay people should never have beautiful, complicated weddings of the kind we see on Bravo or TLC all the time. It's a fun game to say, “Who are you voting for?” and they say “I don't want to tell you,” and you say, “No, who are you voting for,” and they go, “Guess!”
Think about how you want to spend those four years. In college age time, that's 150 years. Also, it's super uncool to be out and about and someone says, “Did you vote,” and “No, I didn't vote, I wasn't ready.”
My first time voting was amazing. It was this line in the sand. Before I was a girl. Now I was a woman. I went to the polling station and pulled back the curtain. I voted for Barack Obama.
Yes, they just compared sex with voting. And they mocked virgins – “No, I didn't vote, I wasn't ready.” And they said that Barack Obama's the guy she'd rather have sex – er, vote – with. They actually saved themselves for Barack Obama (she's 26) – they could have swiped their V(oting)-card with John Kerry, but they were too limp a candidate, apparently. A real flip-flopper.
So they chose to do it for the first time with Barack Obama, since they “cares about and understands women.” In fact, they understand them so well that they exploit them for insane commercials comparing losing your virginity with voting. Obama has young daughters. But that didn't stop them from releasing this commercial. Because this is what Obama thinks of your daughters. This is Obama's official campaign ad. Paid for with their campaign money. Distributed by their campaign. If this ad were any more demeaning to women – who apparently care only about having sex, if you listen to Lena “You Want To Do It” Dunham — it would be produced by Bill Maher and star Bill Clinton.
Oh, wait. That's Obama's actual campaign.
First it was Big Bird. Then it was binders. Then it was bayonets. Now it's about birth control.
According to Barack Obama, this campaign isn't about the economy. Or foreign policy. It's about free birth control as advocated by unbelievably wealthy celebrities. If Obama goes any smaller in this campaign, we're going to need a microscope to find him.
And God knows that women don't want to have sex – er, vote – with a small candidate. In fact, they might prefer a candidate who provides, say, jobs. Or an economy that's not a disaster area. Or perhaps consulates full of live ambassadors.
But at least Dunham got one thing right. The folks who vote for Barack Obama want to vote without consequences.

Volunteers from Remote Area Medical will return this week to Puerto Rico, where they plan to aid efforts to help the people recover from the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in September.
A team of close to 50 volunteers will travel to Puerto Rico during the next three weeks to provide a variety of free medical services including dental work, vision services, and general medical exams at five mobile medical clinics set to traverse the western part of the island.
Remote Area Medical is gearing up to hold 5 mobile medical clinics in Puerto Rico in December. The clinics are set to take place in San Germán, Añasco, San Sebastian, Moca, and Aguada.

The three-week excursion will be RAM's third trip to Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria made landfall, and RAM Founder and President Stan Brock said they expected relief efforts in Puerto Rico to continue into the new year.
“There's a huge amount of devastation, and some of the services are still not up to par,” Brock said. “The telephones and the cellphone towers, power, electricity and clean water; it's going to be a long, hard road for the people down there.
“I'm sure we're going to be following up with more of these events as we get into 2018,” they added.

Brock explained that RAM has been able to bring thousands of pounds of disaster-relief supplies to the island through donations from corporations like FedEx and Cigna of Chattanooga, who donated 20,000 ready-to-eat meals to go with RAM on their upcoming mission.
“The public have really come forward with tremendous help with the essential relief supplies, and FedEx donated a plane-load of 63,043 pounds of essential relief supplies,” Brock said. “We trucked all that stuff to Memphis, and they flew it down there for us at no charge. They came through again and carried the vision and dental equipment there to make this possible.
“I've been doing this volunteer work now for over 30 years, and it never ceases to amaze me, the kindness of the American people,” they added.

During RAM's first two trips to Puerto Rico, Brock said, they and their volunteers worked to establish a foothold of sorts on the island and collaborated with local officials to help determine where their supplies and efforts would be best put to use. Ultimately, RAM decided on five locations in western Puerto Rico near a former U.S. Air Force base in the city of Aguadilla, on the island's northwest corner. Part of RAM's continued response to Puerto Rico's need for humanitarian assistance relies on its ability to move quickly to help those in need, Brock said, an aspect that has been point of contention with the federal government's response.
“We have the capability here,” Brock said. “When bad stuff happens, we don't have to have a long debate like up in Washington. We say, ‘Bad stuff just happened in Houston (for example); we're going to go.' ”

However, RAM's group of volunters does face some legal challenges in practicing outside the states in which they are licensed. According to Brock, state laws from across the country prevent many of the group's volunteers from practicing as part of its mobile clinics, which they say unnecessarily impedes its charity work. Despite the costs and challenges, dozens of volunteers still dedicate their time to RAM's humanitarian efforts, in part because of the difference they are able to make in the lives of others.
“When somebody gets out of the dental chair and hugs the dentist or hugs the optometrist and puts on a pair of glasses and can see, you know you've really made a difference in their lives,” Brock said.
To fulfill its goal of helping as many people as possible, RAM is searching for additional licensed dental, vision, and medical professionals to volunteer their time in Puerto Rico. More information about volunteering can be found at www.ramusa.org/volunteer.

Poland wants Britain's help over NATO troops in Brexit talks
By Wiktor Szary and Justyna Pawlak
WARSAW, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Poland could be open to compromise over British demands to limit the rights of European Union migrants if London helps it bolster the NATO presence in central Europe, Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski told Reuters.
With hundreds of thousands of Poles living in Britain, Warsaw is one of the EU's staunchest critics of Prime Minister David Cameron's proposal to cut benefits for migrants as part of their planned overhaul of Britain's EU membership terms.
Cameron has set a deadline of the end of 2017 for an in-out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU, but recently gave their strongest suggestion yet that they hope to hold it in 2016.
Cameron left Warsaw empty-handed last month after a visit to discuss their push, with Poland's Prime Minister Beata Szydlo saying further talks were needed.
Szydlo's new conservative government, however, is keen to score a diplomatic victory at a summit of the NATO military alliance due to be held in Warsaw in July.
Waszczykowski said the issues were being discussed in tandem.
Asked whether Britain could offer Poland something to soften its opposition to Cameron's proposal, Waszczykowski said: "Of course. Britain could offer something to Poland in terms of international security.
"We still consider ourselves a second-class NATO member-state, because in central Europe ... there aren't, aside from a token presence, any significant allied forces or defence installations, which gives the Russians an excuse to play this region," they said.
In 2014, Poland's then foreign minister said they wanted the alliance to station two NATO heavy brigades - typically between 3,000 and 5,000 troops - on Polish soil in response to Russia's intervention in Ukraine, where Moscow denies it is actively assisting pro-Russian rebels.
The alliance is reluctant to permanently station troops in central Europe, with some states wary of violating a 1997 NATO-Russia agreement on the size of forces the alliance can have in former Warsaw Pact countries, of which Poland is one.
Moscow would almost certainly regard the establishment of a standing NATO presence on its borders as a hostile act.
Some western European allies have also been sceptical about basing large numbers of troops and equipment in Poland at a time when defence budgets are tight and question the military logic of tying down large numbers of troops in one place.
"Britain could support our expectations related to an allied military presence on Polish territory," Waszczykowski said.
ELABORATE COMPROMISE
Waszczykowski said Poland wanted to offset the impact of any benefit cuts for its citizens living in Britain by planning to offer a monthly cash payment to families with children, in the hope Polish workers will stay in Poland instead of emigrating.
They said Warsaw opposed any cuts in benefits in Britain that singled out potential recipients based on their origin.
"We're aware that the British welfare system is very elaborate and that it may not be able to bear it. We are therefore addressing this by increasing our benefits, and we also want to raise salaries in Poland," they said.
EU heads of state are due to discuss British proposals at a summit in February.
NATO defence ministers are scheduled to meet next month in preparation for the NATO summit.
"It would be very difficult for us to accept any discrimination," Waszczykowski said, referring to the migrant talks with London. "Unless Britain helped us really effectively with regard to the Polish defence ambitions at the summit in Warsaw."
After Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula, NATO suspended practical cooperation with Moscow. But after Russia's involvement in Syria, some alliance members, notably Germany, have called for talks with Moscow to be reopened to avoid incidents like the downing of a Russian jet by NATO-member Turkey.
Google says YouTube so overloaded staff cannot filter all terror related content
BRUSSELS (AP) — Internet giant Google said Wednesday that its video-sharing website YouTube is so inundated that staff cannot filter all terror related content, complicating the struggle to halt the publication of terrorist propaganda and hostage videos.
Google Public Policy Manager Verity Harding said that about 300 hours of video material is being uploaded to YouTube every minute, making it virtually impossible for the company to filter all images.
Harding spoke at a European Parliament meeting of the ALDE liberal group on a counter-terrorism action plan.
They said that “to pre-screen those videos before they are uploaded would be like screening a phone call before it's made.”
The European Union's counter-terror chief believes it's time to help companies to contain the security risk by having experts from member states flagging terror-related content.
“We have to help them, and refer to them, and signal content,” Gilles De Kerchove said. “Each member state should have a unit with people trained to do that.”
On YouTube, users can highlight problem videos and have them reviewed by a member of staff.
When a Scotland Yard unit recently told Google about material that did not comply with the company's own guidelines, De Kerchove said 93 percent of that content was removed. But when individuals flag up problems only a third of it is taken down.
Detecting violent, extreme and racist material is a mammoth task. But concerted, targeted warnings from organized groups work best.
“There are community groups and others who do this on a larger scale and they're incredibly helpful to us,” Harding said.
Despite the serious threat posed by extreme and violent videos, neither the big Internet companies nor the European Union appear willing to take on a legal battle to enforce their removal.
“We can contemplate legislation but I suspect it would be an awfully monumental exercise,” De Kerchove said.

The story of the passenger pigeon is unlike that of any other bird. With a likely population between 3 and 5 billion, it was the most abundant bird in North America and probably the world. Yet human exploitation drove this species to extinction over the course of a few decades.
2014 was the centenary of this extraordinary extinction. Project Passenger Pigeon (P3) came into being to mark this anniversary and promote the conservation of species and habitat, strengthen the relationship between people and nature, and foster the sustainable use of natural resources. The project engaged a broad audience through a documentary film, a new book on passenger pigeons, this website, social media, curricula, and a wide range of exhibits and programming for people of all ages.
Looking to the future, P3 still has a valuable role to play in at least two ways: by providing an historical view on species conservation and by continuing to foster the work of artists (of all media) that deal with conservation. A myriad of species are currently suffering declines due to a host of human-caused activities: the story of the passenger pigeon remains a powerful cautionary tale that even the most abundant of species is not immune from potential extinction. By remembering the stories of the passenger pigeon and other lost species and then tying those lessons to modern-day issues, Project Passenger Pigeon seeks to strengthen the relationship between people and the rest of nature and show how each of us can live more sustainably within the Earth's limited natural resources.
Explore this site for more information about these amazing birds, the broader themes of Project Passenger Pigeon, upcoming project activities, and ways you can participate. We will be utilizing social media to a large extent as we move forward so please check out our Facebook and Twitter feeds below the map for P3 related news.

Tiny eye implant could restore sight to the blind - with vision returning instantly, and recovery in just a week
Laser implant can be added under local anaesthetic
Does not require bulky glasses
Will offer black-and-white vision similar to a computer monitor
Enough to watch television and identify faces
Trials to begin in 2013
A revolutionary new eye implant could restore sight to the blind instantly - without bulky glasses or computer equipment.
The 'Bio Retina' will be implanted under local anaesthetic, and will offer black-and-white vision similar to a computer monitor.
The implant's effects will be enough to allow users to watch television and identify faces.
A prototype was made in 2011, and clinical trials are due to begin in 2013.
The views 'seen' through the device: The device is specifically tailored to restore sight to patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and cataracts
The device is specifically tailored to restore sight to patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and cataracts.
'Bio-Retina incorporates various nano-size components in one tiny, flat implant, approximating the size of a child's fingernail,' say the company which manufactures the device, Nano-Retina.
'Its simple 30-minute implant procedure requires local anesthesia, a small incision and 'gluing' of the device to the damaged retina,' says the company.
'Return of sight is anticipated to be instantaneous. Recovery time is estimated at up to one week.'
Other implants are already on sale and in use in the UK and elsewhere, but most require bulky computer glasses, and operations under general anaesthetic.
'Systems currently being researched require general anesthesia and a six-hour operation to implant surgically, construct and connect multiple pieces of hardware in the eye, or alternatively, to insert surgically an implant into the eye which is connected to a wire passing through the patient's skull,' say Nano-Retina.
'Patients wear eyeglasses with an external camera and transmitter as well as a belt with a video processor and battery that charges the system.'
Some of the other devices are built to 'restore' sight in cases of severe injury.
One such device is the creation of Shawn Kelly from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, and the result of a decade's worth of research.
It is made up of two tiny cameras attached to a pair of glasses which send images to a computer chip attached to the patient's eye.
The chip turns the images into an electrical current sent along a wire to a film inserted behind the retina.
A computer chip is attached to the eye, which passes on messages to the brain from cameras mounted on a pair of glasses
Garth Brooks fans have come to expect a showstopping performance from the singer, but at their Minneapolis show on Friday night, one fan in particular got much more than that.
Teresa Shaw, a mom who's been battling stage 3 breast cancer since June, caught the singer's attention when they stood in front of the stage and held up a sign that read “Chemo this morning. Garth tonight. Enjoying ‘The Dance.' ” Brooks, who lost both their mother and sister to cancer, then began to serenade Shaw with their iconic hit and after the song ended, traded them their guitar for their sign.
“You have all of my strength. You have everybody's strength in here. And you go kick cancer's ass!” Brooks told Shaw as the emotional crowd looked on.
“If I'm ever down, I can go to it and think about that night,” Shaw, who traveled to the show from Iowa with their daughter Elizabeth, told local news station KARE-11 on Saturday of the precious gift they got from Brooks.

“It's a reminder to all of us,” Brooks, 52, told reporters after the show. “We can think, ‘Oh my God, two shows on Friday, two shows on Saturday ‘ Well they go through chemo in the morning and comes to the show at night – nothing's hard after that. That puts it all in perspective.”

OSAKA, Japan — Panasonic has decided to halt domestic production of its VCR, in what is becoming a regular occurrence for Japanese electronics firms to stop selling outdated products.
Like the Walkman before it and the minidisc player, the VCR seems like an iconic relic in an age when movies are streamed over the internet and recording content on tapes or discs are about as outdated as fax machines.
But Panasonic said it stopped producing VCRs for the domestic market only at the end of last year. Once they run out of inventory, it will stop sales of VCRs in Japan entirely, the company was quoted as saying Monday.
Panasonic, however, still manufactures VCRs at factories in China and Slovakia. A spokesperson said Panasonic will continue selling VCRs abroad based on market conditions.
Panasonic started selling VHS-tape VCRs in Japan in 1977 — one of the first Japanese manufacturers to introduce the product.
The first VHS-tape VCR was introduced by the Victor Company of Japan, a majority-owned subsidiary of Panasonic that has since merged with audiomaker Kenwood to form JVC Kenwood Holdings. A JVC Kenwood spokesperson said the company stopped in-house production of VCRs in 2006 and it has since stopped selling VCRs entirely.
For much of the 1980s and 1990s, the VCR was a must-have home electronics appliance after a format-war between VHS and Sony's Betamax swung in favor of the VHS tapes. Moreover, it helped to create a new, lucrative business for movie studios and opened the door for an industry of video-rental shops.
Panasonic declined to disclose its VCR sales. However, in a sign of the VCR's diminished stature, the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association does not even track domestic shipments, while it does keep data on similarly outdated offerings such as “car cassette stereos.”
While DVDs replaced VHS tapes as the video media of choice in the early 2000s, VHS tapes still clutter many a home across the world.

If you want to be a serial killer, then being a long-haul trucker is an excellent career choice, according to the FBI.
In a recent blog post and accompanying video about the Highway Serial Killings (HSK) initiative, the nation's top law enforcement agency noted: "If there is such a thing as an ideal profession for a serial killer, it may well be as a long-haul truck driver."
FBI Crime Analyst Christie Palazzolo, who was quoted in the blog and appeared in the video, added that truck driving is an honorable profession and the overwhelming majority of drivers are not murderers. "But it does happen, and the pattern is unmistakable," they said.
The Highway Serial Killings initiative dates to 2004 when an analyst from the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation saw a pattern of murdered women's bodies being dumped along I-40 in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Mississippi. The cases were referred to the FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP) to see if this body-dumping pattern existed on other roads. It did, and the HSK initiative was established although the FBI did not make the program public until 2009.
(Asked to elaborate on the recent blog post and status of the HSK initiative, an FBI official stated in an email: "The Behavioral Analysis Unit, which oversees the HSK initiative, is declining interviews and questions about the program.")
Since the program began, FBI analysts have produced a roster of more than 750 murder victims found along or near U.S. highways. About 450 potential suspects, many of them truck drivers, have also been identified.
Of course, truckers are not the only killers to use the anonymity and convenience of the open road. In their 2012 book ‘Killer on the Road,' author Ginger Strand recounts the stories of non-trucker serial killers, but also states in their chapter on truckers that at least 25 truck drivers are in prison, found guilty of being serial killers.
In their studies, the FBI publicly notes that most victims are women who are "living high-risk, transient lifestyles, often involving substance abuse and prostitution. They're frequently picked up at truck stops or service stations and sexually assaulted, murdered, and dumped along a highway."
Said Palazzolo: "This is not to say that every truck driver is a serial killer obviously, but when we see them come up, when we know we've identified one as a subject, they're extremely difficult to track down, and the mobility of their occupation allows them access to so many different areas of victim selection. And then victim release locations."
Tod Burke, professor of criminal justice at Radford University in Virginia and a former Maryland police officer agrees with the FBI's assessment of victim profiles. "They're easy prey. Truck drivers also could be out traveling late at night. There's not a lot of traffic, so there's not a lot of visibility. If they do pick up a hitchhiker, nobody would pay attention."
They also concur that truck drivers make ideal serial killers because of their mobile job requirement coupled with a lack of supervision. "They have the means of transportation. They have the space … You could bring them [victims] into the truck. You could have activities with them in the truck, sexual or otherwise. You could go to another location and do a drop off."
It's widely accepted in law enforcement circles that some criminals, such as pedophiles, purposely seek out jobs that get them closer to their victims. Is this the case with truck drivers?
"I have not come across that," Burke said. "I think you would have to interview truck drivers who are serial killers and ask them. It would have to be self-disclosed information."

Pro wrestling legend Ric Flair was fond of saying that to be the man, you have to beat the man.
Flair made their home in Charlotte for the bulk of their career in the ring, but they haven't always been in the Panthers' corner. We're not sure where things stand on that front right now, but cornerback Josh Norman seems to agree with their take on the path to becoming a champion.
Norman said Monday that “fate gives you these chances to prove yourself worthy” and the team's chance to do that this weekend comes against the Seahawks. Norman said that they and members of the Seahawks said that they'd see each other again in the playoffs after Carolina beat Seattle during the regular season and that he's relishing the chance to face the NFC's Super Bowl representative for the last two seasons even though it will make for a difficult game.
“Why would you want anything in life that is easy? Shoot, man, if you don't go for it head on, then how can you say you are the best at anything? I think that is the way we are in our society,” Norman said, via Black and Blue Review. “We want things the easy way and stuff to be given to us. We don't want to work for it. We want things to be handed to us. And I don't think that's the way it should be done. I think the way it has been set up is the right way.Go through it the hard way. Challenge yourself to be the best. If you can be the best, beat the best.”
The Seahawks will present a big challenge for the Panthers, but running around challenges has never been a particularly good approach to winning Super Bowls. The Panthers will have to run through them and the Seahawks are the first one on the docket for a 15-1 team that has plenty of reasons to feel confident that they can handle whatever comes their way.
From the fur trade to fisheries and forests, Canada was built on the toil and sweat of those who wanted to prosper. But these days, it's harder to create opportunity. And sometimes, government is to blame.
The latest example comes from Nova Scotia. There, the provincial government just imposed a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing used to produce both oil and natural gas. Some people will be quite happy, asserting fracking is dangerous.
But as my colleague and environmental scientist, Ken Green, tirelessly points out, while portrayed as something new and radical, fracking is a relatively straightforward combination of two technologies (horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing) that date back to the 1920s and 1940s respectively.
On safety, Green cites a literature review in the journal Science, which observes how "more than one million hydraulic fracturing treatments have been conducted, with perhaps only one documented case of direct groundwater pollution resulting from injection of hydraulic fracturing chemicals used for shale gas extraction."
Of course provincial governments can ignore the science and announce whatever they want. But Nova Scotia is a have-not province desperately in need of something more than just another Ottawa equalization cheque. Last year, own-source revenues amounted to $5.7 billion; transfer payments from the federal government were worth just over $3.1 billion, or 55 per cent of what the province raised on its own.
In contrast, Saskatchewan's own-source revenues were about $9.8 billion. Federal transfers were $1.7 billion or 17 per cent of the revenues produced at home. In Alberta, the province reaped $33.8 billion from the locals; Ottawa added $4.8 billion, equivalent to 14 per cent of at-home revenue. One critical difference in revenue flows between Nova Scotia and the other two provinces: royalties and taxes that accrue from oil, gas and other resources that are extracted on the prairies.
The decision by Nova Scotia politicians to turn down potential resource revenues means Nova Scotians will experience more of the same; among other ills, high taxes that could be alleviated by new energy royalties.
How bad are Nova Scotia's taxes? Consider some examples.
In Nova Scotia, the general corporate tax rate is 16 per cent; that compares with 12 per cent in Saskatchewan and 10 per cent in Alberta. Small businesses pay a three per cent tax in Nova Scotia below a $350,000 threshold. In Alberta and Saskatchewan, the rate is three and two per cent respectively on a $500,000 threshold. Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan impose a four per cent and 3.25 per cent capital tax, respectively, on financial institutions (which pass it on to consumers). Alberta imposes no such tax.
Nova Scotians pay a 10 per cent provincial sales tax (embedded in the HST), compared to five per cent in Saskatchewan and zero in Alberta.
More numbers: The total provincial tax bill for a one-income family with two children and a $35,000 income in Alberta: a $1,128 refund; in Saskatchewan, a $923 bill; and in Nova Scotia, a whopping $4,089 provincial tax hit.
A one-income, two-child family with $75,000 in earnings pays $3,212 in total provincial taxes in Alberta, $5,095 in Saskatchewan, and $10,159 in Nova Scotia.
A two-income, two-child family at $100,000 pays provincial taxes of $5,258 in Alberta, $7,445 in Saskatchewan, and $12,116 in Nova Scotia.
Twenty years ago, governments taxed everything that moved. Some, such as Nova Scotia's ruling politicians, still do. They're reinforced in such behaviour by anti-development purists who reject any sensible and safe way of obtaining new revenue. Those foregone royalties and tax receipts could be used to finance government operations or lower taxes. The latter option is a crying need in a high-tax province.
Defensible development is desirable. Centuries ago, Canadians trapped animals to sell fur to the English and Europeans. Now we hawk beef, oil, gas, automobiles, environmental services, financial know-how and high-tech Blackberries to countries around the world.
The result? Jobs, incomes and an enviable standard of living.
But when politicians in Nova Scotia opt out of reasonable development options such as fracking for oil or gas, they leave nothing but high personal taxes and few at-home, in-province opportunities. That's not exactly helpful for Nova Scotians.
Mark Krikorian: Rubio and Trump Dissemble on H1-B Visas
Well, Rubio dissembled. Trump seemed like they hadn't read "his" own immigration plan.
Mark Krikorian -- who no one can claim is an immigration dove -- finds that Rubio was simply lying when they claimed that they wanted to "reform" the H1-B process, and guarantee that companies had to recruit Americans first, and pay H1-B workers at least as much as previous (American) workers.
If that's what they want, why isn't that in their bill? All their bill does is triple the number of H1-B visas, without "reforming" anything, unless you consider giving corporate patrons handjobs "reform."
This is why Trump's website calls Rubio "Zuckerberg's personal Senator," though Trump, apparently, is unaware their website says this. Mark Zuckerberg loves them some low-cost foreign replacements (and American workers on welfare); Rubio loves that too, because Zuckerberg told them to love it.
[Rubio repeated] three times their demand that employers using H-1B visas to replace Americans should be barred from the program -- except that "abuses" aren't the problem. When Disney laid off hundreds of highly skilled Americans in Rubios own state and forced them to train their cheaper foreign replacements imported on H1-B visas, that wasnt an abuse of the program -- that's the way it's supposed to work. In the past couple of years, Toys 'R' Us has done the same thing, and SunTrust and Fossil and Southern California Edison and Northeast Utilities and others. The law was written precisely to allow this. Rubio was clearly suggesting that these actions should not be permitted. So one would assume that the H1-B bill that they introduced in the Senate earlier this year -- the "I-Squared" bill, that would triple the number of H1-B foreign workers admitted -- addresses those "abuses," right? After all, they said in the debate: We need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms. For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days. You also have to prove that youre going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor. But Rubio's bill on this very topic does none of these things. It does not require recruitment of American workers. It does not require employers to "pay more than you would pay someone else." In fact, Ron Hira, one of the leading researchers in this area, says Rubios bill would provide Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and their comrades "a huge increase in the supply of lower-cost foreign guest workers so they can undercut and replace American workers."
As for Trump: Trump's own plan does in fact call for such reforms -- the one on their website. But this is precisely the plan they disowned at the debate, claiming Becky Quick was just making this up. "I don't know where you people get this," they said, or words to that effect.
Although this seemed at the moment to be Trump demolishing Becky Quick for their shoddy research, in fact, they were correct: They read this on Trump's website.
It's part of the immigration plan Jeff Sessions wrote for them -- which Donald Trump apparently did not even read. They slapped it up on the website, said "Here's my plan," but apparently hasn't been f***ed enough to read it.
Because this is not the first time Trump has talked up making sure we get all these wonderful highly-skilled foreign workers here on H1-B workers.
I've noted this on the blog before: the immigration policy that Trump puts on their website -- written by Jeff Sessions -- promises reforms and restrictions on the H1-B program.
But every single time Trump actually talks about it, they talk about letting in as many highly-skilled workers as possible. We can't lose such people, they say. We can't have them go to school at Harvard, then go work in another country.
So we need them... to displace existing American workers.
It's not just that this is a contradiction. It's a contradiction they don't even attempt to reconcile, because I don't think he's even aware of what "his" immigration plan on their website actually says.
Michele Malkin, who introduced me to this issue when they came on the podcast, isn't having it:
Which is why I urged caution/skepticism of double-talking Trump all along. https://t.co/YDRuLb69YS — Michelle Malkin (@michellemalkin) October 29, 2015
Either Trump wants H1B's reformed and restricted or they do not. Their website says one thing; their mouth says another. When asked about the reform/restriction plan, they go so far to actually disown the idea, and to claim it has nothing to do with him.
Well, which is it?
Many people -- including me-- are giving Trump a chance specifically because of their pro-American-worker positioning on illegal -- and legal -- immigration. Supposedly, because they didn't need corporate money to fuel their campaign, they had the ability to actually say "no" to corporate demands to replace American workers with cheaper foreign imports and stick up for actual Americans for a change.
But if they don't believe their own plan -- indeed, if they don't even know what the hell their plan even says -- then what is the point of him?
Note: Krikorian also makes the case against Trump, though I haven't quoted their language on that (I already quoted enough of them for Rubio).

The trend indicates that in France, there are currently three young practicing Muslims for every young practicing Catholic.
"Avignon is no longer the city of the Popes, but of the Salafis. ... They [Muslim extremists] urge us to rewrite the history of France in the light of the 'contribution of the Islamic civilization'" — Philippe De Villiers, author of Will the Church Bells Ring Tomorrow?
A new book is shaking France. Les cloches sonneront-elles encore demain? ("Will the Church Bells Ring Tomorrow?"), by Philippe de Villiers, is shattering the nation. France, the "eldest daughter" of the Catholic Church, is instead turning into "the eldest daughter of Islam". "With arrogance, they [Muslim extremists] urge us to rewrite the history of France in the light of the 'contribution of the Islamic civilization'", de Villiers states.
De Villiers points out that:
"France has experienced many misfortunes in its history. But for the first time, it must face the fear of disappearing. In France, there are two groups: a new people who move with pride and an exhausted people, who are not even aware of the conditions needed for their own survival".
De Villiers paints a grim picture of French Catholicism: "Avignon is no longer the city of the Popes, but of the Salafis". In Saint-Denis, where the French kings and Charles Martel are buried, "tunics and beards now dominate, and girls are dressed in the Islamic shrouds". If a parish is still alive there, it is thanks to the zeal of the Christian community of Africans and Tamils. "The Kings' cemetery is just one enclave. It belongs to a story that does not count anymore".
The bell towers of the churches in de Villiers' book are already growing silent in Boissettes (Seine-et-Marne), and on the outskirts of Metz, where the bells of the church of Sainte Ruffine have been forced by the state secularist authorities to keep silent. It happened in the Breton village of Hédé-Bazouges, where silence is filled by the sound of what de Villiers calls "the clergy in the djellaba" [outer robe worn by North Africans] -- the muezzin's call to prayer. It is happening everywhere in France.
Will France soon forbid the ringing of Notre Dame's bells? It happened already in Boissettes, and on the outskirts of Metz, where the bells of the church of Sainte Ruffine have been forced by the state authorities to keep silent. Meanwhile, the muezzin's calls to Islamic prayer continue to broadcast. (Images source: Wikimedia Commons)
"France is no longer a Catholic country", writes Frederic Lenoir, editor-in-chief of Le Monde des Religions. Le Figaro wondered if Islam can already be considered "France's prime religion".
It is estimated today in France that for every practicing Muslim there are three practicing Catholics. But if the analysis is deepened, it appears that this ratio will soon reverse. Comparing only the weekly frequency of attending a mosque on Friday and a church on Sunday, the scenario is clear: 65% of practicing Catholics are over the age of 50. By contrast, 73% of practicing Muslims are under 50. The trend indicates that in France, there are currently three young practicing Muslims for every young practicing Catholic.
The same is true for the construction of new religious sites. There are nearly 2,400 mosques today in France, compared to 1,500 in 2003: "This is the most visible sign of the rapid growth of Islam in France", according to the weekly magazine, Valeurs Actuelles. Almost two new mosques are built each week: that is the pace of expansion of Muslim places of worship in France for the last 10 years. The record is held by Corsica: in 2003 there were no Muslim places of worship, now it has 11.
Muslim countries are generously funding France's mosques. Foreign funding covers an average of 50% of total costs: for the Grand Mosque of Strasbourg, 37% came from Morocco, 13% from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. At Roissy-en-Brie, the Sultanate of Oman contributed 1.8 million euros, or two-thirds, of the budget. In Marseille, Qatar will provide 25% of the funding.
Charles Adhémar, a French political scientist, also commented on the "de-Christianization and gradual Islamization of France". The picture over the last year has been devastating: A Catholic priest murdered inside a French church by Muslim extremists; Muslim leaders who call to convert empty churches into mosques; Christian faithful dragged from Paris's churches before they are demolished. Even Lourdes, France's most famous Catholic site, lies in crisis because of the shortage of pilgrims.
French Catholicism is now witnessing a tragic decline, caught between two fires: state secularism and political Islam. "In forty years, France has become the nation in Western Europe where the population of Muslim origin is the most important", wrote the Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official daily newspaper. "It is conceivable that Islam is overtaking Catholicism".
That is why for 45% of French Catholics, Islam represents a "threat". That is why for the last few years, a growing number of French intellectuals, mostly secular authors, published books raising the alarm on this religious outstripping.
One author is Pierre Manent, who in the book La situation de France writes that "we are witnessing the extension and the consolidation of the domain of Muslim practices rather than its shrinking or relaxation".
Another is Éric Zemmour, public enemy number one of the French left; they just penned a new book, Un quinquennat pour rien ("A Five Year Term for Nothing" -- quinquennat is the five year term served by France's president), in which they call for "a cultural revolution that can afford only to win the war of civilizations taking place on our land".
A renowned sociologist of religion, Danièle Hervieu-Léger, also published a book that sounds like a verdict: Catholicisme, la fin d'un monde ("Catholicism, the End of a World"). Hervieu-Léger makes up their own word to describe this end: "exculturation". It brings to mind not a battle that is taking place but one that is already finished.
In the fight between "the cube and the cathedral" -- the Arche de la Défense built in Paris by François Mitterrand as a symbol of modernity, and the Cathedral of Notre Dame -- the cube is overtaking the church. Both are dominated by the Islamic crescent.

More than 170 passengers and crew on a nearly month-long cruise that docked in California on Sunday fell ill with norovirus while on the ship, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
Symptoms of norovirus include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever and body aches, which 158 passengers and 14 crew members have reported suffering from during the 28 days of aboard the Crown Princess, operated by Princess Cruises, according a statement from the CDC.
The Crown Princess was supposed to return to port in Los Angeles on Saturday, but the boat had to make a diversion to Nuku Hiva, in the Marquesas Islands, last Monday when a crew member was stricken with an ailment that required emergency surgery due to an "entirely separate and individual medical issue," according to a statement from Princess Cruises.
"We are sorry this incident has impacted our guests' vacations and are grateful for their understanding given the circumstances," the cruise line said.
More than 3,000 passengers and 1,100 crew members are aboard the ship, according to officials.
The ship will be disinfected in San Pedro, California, on Sunday afternoon, the CDC said. Passengers boarding the same ship for a seven-day trip later in the day will be notified, according to the CDC.
In January, a Princess Cruise ship was forced to dock a day early after 162 passengers and 11 crew became sick with norovirus.
IN-DEPTH

With hurricane/tropical storm Harvey continuing to pound portions of Texas and Louisiana, the total extent of the damage is still unclear. Already, CNN estimates around 30,000 people are in or are seeking emergency shelter and nearly half a million are anticipated to ask for federal assistance. What's more, Cox Automotive estimates that close to a half million cars will have to be scrapped due to flood damage. These include both older models and what Edmunds.com estimates could be as many as 200,000 new-inventory vehicles left underwater in storm-ravaged areas.
In addition to the obvious damage done to upholstery and carpeting, flood water is a corrosive and abrasive mixture of water and dirt (and sometimes salt) that works its way virtually everywhere within a vehicle and can especially damage to electronics, lubricants, and mechanical systems. Extensive disassembly may be needed for a thorough cleaning and reconditioning. Depending on its make, model and age, the cost to restore a flood-damaged vehicle could exceed its value, in which case the owner's insurance company would consider it “totaled.”
Such vehicles are legally bound to have their titles labeled as being salvaged. They're usually sold at auction to auto graveyards and vehicle rebuilders, and are typically scrapped and recycled, often with some components harvested and reconditioned. But as is the unfortunate case following major storms, as many as half of them are likely to be cleaned up, repaired, and sold to unsuspecting buyers, according to the title-search company CarFax. Some will be repaired and sold with titles that are clearly marked as having been “rebuilt” – in which case it's buyer beware – but many others will carry illegally altered titles. And still more that were either not insured or weren't damaged enough to be declared as total wrecks will be spiffed up and offered with otherwise clear titles.
As it is, CarFax says over 271,000 flood-affected cars remained on the nation's roads last year, and that number is expected to swell considerably in Harvey's wake. Ironically, CarFax cited Houston as being home to the most flood-damaged cars of any major city in the U.S. during 2016 with an estimated 19,314 formerly waterlogged models still being driven.
Used-car shoppers should thus be on the alert in the weeks and months ahead for water-damaged cars being offered for sale by private owners or on used-car lots that should have otherwise been relegated to the scrap heap. According to CarFax, flood-damaged cars are most likely to turn up in states affected by coastal and river flooding, though they can find their way into buyers' hands virtually anywhere within the contiguous 48 states.
For starters, it's critical to check the title history of any pre-owned vehicle you're considering by running its VIN (vehicle identification number) through CarFax, Experian's Auto Check or the National Insurance Crime Bureau's VinCheck to see if it's been reported as having been flooded or salvaged. Numerous sources report flood and damage information to such services, including insurance companies and state Departments of Motor Vehicles. In addition, it's always a good idea to have qualified mechanic inspect a pre-owned vehicle before signing a bill of sale, both to gauge its overall mechanical condition and to determine if it in fact has hidden water damage.
But an astute used-vehicle shopper should keep an eye out for sure signs of flooding while still in the process of “kicking the tires.” That means closely examining the vehicle's interior and engine compartment for evidence of water and grit. Look for signs of recently shampooed or replaced carpeting or freshly cleaned upholstery that may have been performed subsequent to flooding. Pull up a corner of the carpeting (both in the passenger compartment and trunk), and check for water residue or stain marks, signs of rust, and/or evidence of mold or a musty odor. See if there's water still hiding in the dashboard and interior storage cubbies. Check under the dashboard for brittle wiring and evidence of dried mud and other deposits; look for rust on screws in the center console or other areas that might have been submerged.
Open the hood and look for mud, water residue, or rust in crevices, behind wiring harnesses and around small recesses in and around components. Look for water or signs of condensation in the headlamps and taillights, on the instrument panel gauges, and even within the overhead dome light. And be sure to check the wheel wells, and around the doors, hood and trunk panels for evidence of rust.
If you suspect there's been some degree of water damage, we'd suggest walking away from the deal, no matter how attractive the asking price might be. Though it may look good and start up just fine, a submerged car could be rusting away from the inside, and may take weeks or even months for some flood-caused problems to surface. Buyer beware, indeed.

A “blood-soaked” Israeli flag featured prominently at a recent anti-Trump campus event, The Algemeiner has learned.
Footage posted on social media from the “Muslim Immigration and Refugee Ban Solidarity March” at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) on Monday shows students holding up the flag, which is covered in red hand prints, simulating blood.
A female student wearing a hijab is seen yelling into a megaphone against past and current US administrations for being “complacent” against “state violence” and for “not listening” to the concerns of minorities. Students are also seen holding an American flag upside down.
The demonstration was co-sponsored by a number of UIUC groups, including the school's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and Muslim Student Association (MSA), in protest against US President Donald Trump's controversial executive order travel ban.
The introduction of the “bloodied” flag at a gathering ostensibly staged to demonstrate against a policy of the new Trump administration was the latest example of students co-opting an event to express hostility to the Jewish state. Earlier this week, a similar practice was seen at a rally at the University of California, Irvine.
According to the website Campus Reform, a student at the rally told fellow demonstrators, “I want you guys to be about anti-Islamophobia; I want you guys to be anti-Zionism; and I want you guys to be anti-Israel because Trump didn't come up with these things on their own. They got the idea of the wall from Israel.”
The student then led the crowd in a chant that has become popular at anti-Trump demonstrations across the country: “From Palestine to Mexico, all the walls have got to go.”
As The Algemeiner reported last month, campus watchdog groups slammed student activists for taking advantage of the rage being expressed against Trump to further their anti-Israel agenda. One organization called such moves “dangerous,” saying that “protesters are receiving slanted information and most are not even aware that their particular cause has been co-opted by these extremist voices.”
Since Trump signed the executive order on immigration, hundreds of thousands of protesters have gathered at airports across the country to rally against the policy.
Watch the UIUC demonstration, featuring the “bloodied” Israeli flag, below:
The FIA's hastily applied Superlicence rules are likely to be questioned further after Max Verstappen's impressive Formula 1 début in the Australian Grand Prix.
The seventeen-year-old Scuderia Toro Rosso driver performed admirably at Albert Park, hardly putting a foot wrong all weekend, belying their young age and apparent lack of experience, ultimately only retiring when their car expired just after their maiden pit stop whilst running inside the top ten.
In fact, since making their first appearance in a Formula 1 car at the back end of 2014, Verstappen has been virtually error-free, and this makes the reasoning behind the introduction of the new Superlicence rules from the beginning of 2016 seem wide of the mark.
The FIA introduced the Superlicence rules in January, with the idea to clamp down on young and inexperienced drivers such as Verstappen making it into Formula 1. From 2016, a driver will need to be at least eighteen to race in F1, meaning Verstappen is likely to remain the youngest driver in Formula 1 history.
A driver will also have to have raced for at least two years in junior formulae, and acquired a certain number of points based on their championship results over a three-year period. Verstappen's second year in motor sport is in Formula 1…
However, with Verstappen's performance, should these new rules be re-evaluated?
Verstappen has proved in just one race that age is just a number, and experience counts for very little if you have the talent behind the wheel. The FIA introduced the change in regulations because they were worried about them being out of their depth, but it is apparent already that they are not.
The Red Bull Junior programme were right to take the Dutchman under their wings, and promote them into the race seat alongside Carlos Sainz Jr. Their car control is excellent, and they showed in Australia that they belong in Formula 1. Their level-headiness was also top notch, with their lack of experience not showing due to showing maturity beyond their years.
Many questioned whether the Superlicence rules needed changing in the first place, and now Verstappen has thrown further doubts into the discussion. Modern-day Formula 1 teams are sensible, and won't take just any driver into their team, and most know that talent of the like of Verstappen only comes around every now and then.
It is already incredibly hard, and expensive, to reach Formula 1, and these new Superlicence rules look set to make it even more difficult. F1 needs talent like Verstappen in its field, yet the FIA look set to limit the opportunities drivers have to reach F1.
Maybe now the FIA should sit down, realise that the old Superlicence rules were working, and maybe revise their plans about the new rules. Verstappen was ready, the FIA just assumed otherwise.

Press Release
The leader of the government regularly sits down with their senior generals and spies and advisers and reviews a list of the people they want them to authorize their agents to kill. They do this every Tuesday morning when the leader is in town. The leader once condemned any practice even close to this, but now relishes the killing because they have convinced themselves that it is a sane and sterile way to keep their country safe and themselves in power. The leader, who is running for re-election, even invited their campaign manager to join the group that decides whom to kill.
This is not from a work of fiction, and it is not describing a series of events in the Kremlin or Beijing or Pyongyang. It is a fair summary of a 6,000-word investigative report in The New York Times earlier this week about the White House of Barack Obama. Two Times journalists, Jo Becker and Scott Shane, painstakingly and chillingly reported that the former lecturer in constitutional law and liberal senator who railed against torture and Gitmo now weekly reviews a secret kill list, personally decides who should be killed and then dispatches killers all over the world -- and some of their killers have killed Americans.
We have known for some time that President Obama is waging a private war. By that I mean they are using the CIA on their own -- and not the military after congressional authorization -- to fire drones at thousands of persons in foreign lands, usually while they are riding in a car or a truck.
They have done this both with the consent and over the objection of the governments of the countries in which they have killed. They don't want to talk about this, but they don't deny it. How chilling is it that David Axelrod -- the president's campaign manager -- has periodically seen the secret kill list? Might this be to keep the killings politically correct?
Can the president legally do this? In a word: No.
The president cannot lawfully order the killing of anyone, except according to the Constitution and federal law. Under the Constitution, they can only order killing using the military when the U.S. has been attacked, or when an attack is so imminent and certain that delay would cost innocent American lives, or in pursuit of a congressional declaration of war. Under federal law, they can only order killing using civilians when a person has been sentenced lawfully to death by a federal court and the jury verdict and the death sentence have been upheld on appeal. If they use the military to kill, federal law requires public reports of its use to Congress and congressional approval after 180 days.
The U.S. has not declared war since World War II. If the president knows that an attack on our shores is imminent, he'd be hard-pressed to argue convincingly that a guy in a truck in a desert 10,000 miles from here -- no matter their intentions -- poses a threat to the U.S. so imminent and certain that they need to be killed on the spot in order to save the lives of Americans who would surely die during the time it would take to declare war on the country that harbors him, or during the time it would take to arrest him. Under no circumstances may they use civilian agents for non-judicial killing. Surely, CIA agents can use deadly force to protect themselves, but they may not use it offensively. Federal laws against murder apply to the president and to all federal agents and personnel, wherever they go on the planet.
Since 9/11, the United States government has set up national security systems that function not under the Constitution, not under the Geneva Conventions, not under the rule of law, not under the rules of war, not under federal law, but under a new secret system crafted by the Bush administration and personally directed by Obama, the same Obama who condemned these rules as senator and then extended them as president. In the name of fighting demons in pick-up trucks and wars that Congress has never declared, the government shreds our rights, taps our cellphones, reads our e-mails, kills innocents abroad, strip searches 87-year-old grandmothers in wheelchairs and 3-year-old babies in their mothers' arms, and offers secrecy when the law requires accountability.
Obama has argued that their careful consideration of each person they orders killed and the narrow use of deadly force are an adequate and constitutional substitute for due process. The Constitution provides for no such thing. They have also argued that the use of drones to do their killing is humane since they are “surgical” and only kill their targets. We know that is incorrect. And they have argued that these killings are consistent with our values. What are they talking about? The essence of our values is the rule of law, not the rule of presidents.

"In this era we have moved to a point where we have become so politically correct that suddenly it is not only perfectly okay , and acceptable in common situation , but encouraged and beat into our children's heads from birth to judge, bash, and condemn anyone who is of a more statuesque build than you, or fits more ideally inside of the model of the golden ratio."

Its undeniable that when we stand a skinny, athletic or even average sized female next to a larger (even if less healthy, overweight or obese) female, that unless we live outside of this stigma, we as Americans will assume that the heavier person is funnier, smarter, nicer, and less sexually promiscuous, all because they are not as thin or physically fit than the girl next to them
The premise of the book is not to bash or assault any single body type, quite the opposite. I want to share the stories of women who have dealt with this discriminatory action.
Why should a woman have to apologize for wanting to be fit?
Why should a woman have to apologize because they like to run? or eat healthy? or just has the metabolism that is geared to keep weight at bay?
There are millions of women out there and im sure you know at least one looking for a voice , not from tvs and magazines, not from Victoria's Secret.. but from the ground level , to speak up and tell them that its okay to want to be in better shape.
It doesn't make you stupid or shallow or un-motherly or bad person to want to take care of your body.
I think this book will probably upset a few people, i think it will be looked at wrong by some people..
But.. if it just makes it into the hands of ONE little girl who feels like they have to be overweight to fit in with the current 70% of the overweight population of America, and it gives them the strength to know that being healthy isnt a bad thing.
Then this whole project is worth all the time and effort i can possibly afford to put into it.
WHERE WILL THIS MONEY GO?!
The money im looking for will go into printing in the form of $10 per book times 1000 books .($10,000) and a certain amount of design and professional photo work we will not be able to handle on our own as well as some advertising, not even so much for sales but to make sure we get our message out.
There will be 100+ women in the book , so this is something that could have , on its own, made the projects budget undo-able, but so many women have pledged to help get this project out that i feel like we can handle the models , photography, design and a small amount of advertising with in the $10,000 allotted. I have been called insane for thinking i can do so but i believe that sticking to this budget is something we can do because of the tremendous support we have already gotten from women who are exited to get their voice out and from the photographic staff that has said they would love to help them.
Giving women — and men, who are Planned Parenthood's fastest growing demographic — access to family planning helps women succeed in the workforce, the organization's president says.
However, Cecile Richards added, as Congress threatens to cut funding to organizations like Planned Parenthood, public benefits including access to birth control will force people to make other choices. The abortion rate will go up under President Donald Trump, they said.
"The single biggest reason why women can participate in our economy is because they can plan their families," Richards said during the Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, on Thursday.
Although there's still a long way to go, technology is allowing health-care organizations like Planned Parenthood reach more patients. It currently sees 2.5 million patients in its offices, but treats millions more online through various means, they said.
"Most of our patients are young people," Richards said. "They are digitally native. Everything has changed."
One patient in the Arctic Circle was able to video conference with a doctor, who then had a float plane bring them a birth control device. Drones also can be used for delivering devices, Richards said.
One teen texted with Planned Parenthood employees to address a health concern, Richards said. Although their issue was solved, they asked if someone would be around later that night. Texting would allow medical professionals to stay in touch past office hours.
Technology can also help make teen pregnancy an "issue of the past" if people had access to more education and medical professionals, Richards said. However, there are other factors like geography and race that are also at play. Access to information needs to be improved, they said.
"It's a very slow moving change," they said.

Press Release: IMF Staff Completes 2016 Article IV Mission to South Africa
End-of-Mission press releases include statements of IMF staff teams that convey preliminary findings after a visit to a country. The views expressed in this statement are those of the IMF staff and do not necessarily represent the views of the IMF's Executive Board. Based on the preliminary findings of this mission, staff will prepare a report that, subject to management approval, will be presented to the IMF's Executive Board for discussion and decision.
Press Release No. 16/200
May 6, 2016
An International Monetary Fund mission team led by Ms. Laura Papi visited Pretoria, Johannesburg, and Cape Town from April 18 to May 4, to conduct the 2016 Article IV Consultation discussions with South Africa.
At the conclusion of the visit, Ms. Papi made the following statement:
“South Africa faces a challenging economic environment. The IMF projects 2016 growth at 0.6 percent, entailing falling per-capita income. A muted recovery is envisaged from 2017. Risks to this outlook are tilted to the downside and include further shocks from China, heightened global financial volatility, and sovereign debt credit rating downgrades. On the upside, the recent dialogue between government and social partners could catalyze reform implementation and invigorate growth.
“South Africa needs to create an environment that facilitates high and inclusive private sector-led growth that creates more jobs. The government and the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) have taken appropriate steps to counter rising government debt and inflation. Moving forward, structural reforms are imperative to reduce policy uncertainty, boost confidence, tackle structural impediments, and lower vulnerabilities.
“The government is making welcome progress on addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, especially in the electricity sector, has committed to state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform, and is strengthening public procurement. A comprehensive package of structural reforms remains the preferred option to create jobs and reduce inequality. An initial, focused set of tangible measures could help generate sustained reform momentum.
“The government's 2016 Budget targets are appropriately ambitious, but may be challenging to achieve if the IMF's macroeconomic projections materialize. Policies to maintain debt sustainability are essential to preserve investor confidence, but need to be carefully calibrated to avoid pressuring an already-weak economy. Strengthening governance, private participation in SOEs and greater spending efficiency are key interventions to improve SOE performance and service delivery. After the SARB's recent rate hikes, monetary policy may be able to remain on hold, though more tightening could be needed if inflation expectations and core inflation rise significantly.
“The government and the SARB are advancing key financial sector reforms, and stress tests carried out by the SARB suggest the banking sector remains resilient. Heightened monitoring of financial sector risks is warranted given the weak economy, tightening financial conditions, regulatory changes, and extensive linkages between macroeconomic and financial sector developments. The SARB could seize opportunities to build international reserves, especially in case of large, FDI-related foreign exchange inflows.”
The mission met with Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, South African Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago, Minister in the Presidency for Planning, Performance, Monitoring, Evaluation and Administration Jeff Radebe, Minister of Trade and Industry Rob Davies, Minister of Economic Development Ebrahim Patel, Commissioner of the South African Revenue Service Tom Moyane; senior officials of the National Treasury, South African Reserve Bank, and government departments ; the National Economic Development and Labor Council; senior leadership of the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the Federation of Unions in South Africa; and financial market and business representatives.
A federal UK would begin to fix a “failure of politics” reflected in support for Scottish independence and the vote for Brexit, Kezia Dugdale has said.
The Scottish Labour leader said their party's plan for a new constitutional convention would bring power closer to people and communities in the face of a rise in populism.
Delegates at Scottish Labour's conference in Perth later this month will be asked to back a motion calling for a “progressive federal structure” for the UK.
The motion calls for the UK Labour Party to convene a people's constitutional convention to report before the next UK general election.
Ms Dugdale used an address at University College London to reiterate their party's opposition to a second independence referendum.
They said: “Brexit represented a failure of our politics. People willing to take a leap in the dark and vote for independence represented a failure of our politics.
“And in the face of it, governing parties haven't just ignored the problem. They've doubled down on the disastrous policies that got us here in the first place, and now, even after all that we've gone through; we're making the same mistakes again.

“How could we possibly go through the past decade, and face the next decade, and believe that the way we govern ourselves doesn't need to change?”
Ms Dugdale added: “Our proposal seeks to build out from the benefits we already derive from being part of the UK, and it would bring power closer to people.
“It does mean more powers for the Scottish Parliament - starting with those powers in devolved areas that will return from Brussels in the coming years.
“These are the proposals that we will take to any constitutional convention in the future, and which I believe would strengthen the UK well into the future.
“The vast majority of people in Scotland want what the Labour Party wants - a strong Scotland, with a strong Scottish Parliament, inside the United Kingdom. I believe that is even truer now after Brexit.”
Speaking at the same event, Liberal Democrat Welsh peer Baroness Randerson also called for a new federal UK settlement.
They said: “Brexit threatens to impose an intolerable strain on the very structure of the UK. It is generally agreed that the Brexit vote was a symptom of public unhappiness with the status quo, that runs much deeper than the powers of the EU.
“The stresses are greatest in Scotland, which voted to remain, and in Wales, which voted to leave but is led by a Government that wants to remain.
“What we therefore need is a ‘refresh' of federalism but it must be accompanied by renewed and real trust in the people. No more centralised solutions, but devolution of power to communities instead.”
Keshi Anderson was earning less than £200 a month at Barton Rovers
Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew says non-league signing Keshi Anderson will be in their squad to face Leicester.
Anderson, 19, joined Palace on deadline day from Barton Rovers, who play in Southern League Division One Central - seven tiers below the top flight.
Pardew urged Anderson to "forget where they have come from" and how much they cost ahead of a possible debut.
They said: "Keshi's now a Palace player and he'll be classed the same as Jordon Mutch, who has cost £4.5m."
Anderson secured their move to Selhurst Park after scoring a six-minute hat-trick in a trial game against Palace.
"Six minutes isn't bad, is it?" said Pardew, who rose through the ranks of non-league football before they joined Palace in 1987.
"It's a great opportunity for them and a similar route that I took myself, coming from non-league, so he'll have sympathetic eyes from me looking for them to progress."
Pardew on Harry Redknapp
Harry Redknapp quit as QPR manager earlier this week, citing imminent knee replacement surgery.
"I don't think he's called it a day. He's called it a day at QPR but I think he'll be very keen to come back once he's got themselves up and running.
"He's a fantastic football manager, had a tremendous career I think football will miss them until they return. I wish them a very, very speedy recovery."
On Wilfried Zaha
Palace re-signed winger Wilfried Zaha from Manchester United in the the transfer window for £3m, having originally sold them to the Red Devils for £15m in January 2013.
Wilfried Zaha made just four appearances for Manchester United during their time at Old Trafford
"The most important thing is to have a player that you are going to enhance and bring value to the football club and not to somebody else.
"I thought it was important we secured their future here and kick-started their career. They have fabulous technical ability and they need to bring that on a consistent basis to the first team."
On FA Cup tie with Liverpool
Palace will face Liverpool in the FA Cup fifth round. The match at Selhurst Park will bring back memories for Pardew, who scored the winner for Palace against Liverpool in a classic semi-final in 1990.
"It was going to be always a kind of historic game if we play Liverpool because of the history.
"There will be a lot riding on the game in terms of passion and memories and it's one that we can look forward to."

Housing benefit claimants who fall into arrears when their payments are cut will not receive full support from their councils, an MP warned today.
Speaking at a Westminster Hall debate, Liberal Democrat MP for St Ives Andrew George said the cuts to housing benefit announced in the emergency Budget and the comprehensive spending review would lead to an increase in homelessness and demand for social housing.
They said tenants who were no longer able to pay their rent as a result of a shortfall in their housing benefit ‘will be found intentionally homeless and therefore not eligible for assistance from the local authority'.
Councils are only obliged to provide temporary accommodation for a limited amount of time to those found intentionally homeless.
The National Housing Federation said it was expecting a number of test cases to challenge this situation once the cuts come in from April next year.
Fourth and Long
As you're watching the Raiders and Cowboys (or, for late eaters, the Giants and Broncos) butt heads this Thursday, ponder this: NFL teams don't go for it enough. That can teach us a lot about more consequential fields, including foreign policy. The attachment to punting, at the expense of winning, shows how conventional wisdom discourages leaders from doing what is best for their teams, firms, and country.
Consider the controversy that's still raging in Boston: the New England Patriots' decision to go for the win on fourth down against the Indianapolis Colts on Nov. 15. The Patriots led the Colts by six with about two minutes left. It was fourth and 2. Going for it and failing meant giving the ball back to star quarterback Peyton Manning, in their home stadium, 28 yards from the endzone. Punt and the Colts would have to drive some 60 yards to get the touchdown. Punting, we all know, is the safe thing to do there. Coach Bill Belichick went for it.
Tom Brady's pass to Kevin Faulk was ruled short of the first-down marker, and the Colts then scored and won. Fans and commentators denounced Belichick's gamble. Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy called it an unrivaled gaffe. Former Patriots safety Rodney Harrison said it was the worst decision they had seen Belichick make. The old Colts coach, Tony Dungy, said you go with the percentages and punt.
But the percentages don't say that. Belichick didn't gamble, according to analysts who use NFL history to judge how coaching decisions impact the probability of winning. AdvancedNFLStats.com, for example, found that going for it in that situation gives a team a 79 percent chance of winning. (The quick breakdown: Teams pick up fourth and twos 60 percent of the time. Convert, and you can run out the clock and win. If you don't make it, the opponent gets a touchdown just over half the time.) Punting, by contrast, gives a team only a 70 percent chance of winning. And those are averages — with the Colts' elite offense playing against a worn-out Pats' defense, the case for punting is worse.
Among football-stats hobbyists, that conclusion is uncontroversial. They are puzzled why teams punt so often. An economist, David Romer, even analyzed past NFL fourth downs and found that teams have systematically given away points by kicking. They reasoned that if the NFL's competitive pressures don't cause teams to maximize scoring, markets might not cause firms to maximize profit.
Social convention explains this deviation from what seems rational. Five Super Bowl rings give Belichick the job security to play the odds and let critics howl. Less-secure coaches have a different calculus. Critics can ruin their career. To protect their reputation, they might punt even knowing that it lowers the odds of winning. Punting reinforces the convention — if Tony Dungy does it, it must make sense — making it tougher for new Belichicks to emerge.
Examples in business abound. Economic downturn might ruin a bank carrying excessive debt given its equity. The bank's interest is to reduce debt. But bankers opposing risky investments might look foolish while a boom continues, encouraging them to let sleeping dogs lie. The managers' interests don't match the firm's.
Economists call this the principal-agent problem. It can occur in any situation where someone is making decisions for someone else, including government. Democracy uses elections to tie agents' interests to their principals'. But rational politicians can't serve the national interest if the public misperceives it.
The business of fighting terrorism is particularly prone to this problem. As with most national security dangers, information about terrorism comes mostly from public institutions that combat it. Their bureaucratic interest is often to promote worst-case estimates. Furthermore, terrorism's attributes make people overly fearful of its consequences. Psychology shows that traumatic events like the Sept. 11 attacks sear themselves into our consciousness, causing us to overestimate their likelihood. We also tend to fear mysterious, uncontrollable risks like biological terrorism far more than more mundane and deadly ones, like driving.
Overestimation of terrorism's danger spreads as people learn from their friends. Some doubt that judgment but echo it anyway, because conformity is polite. Pundits, who fear that heretical views will damage their careers, do the same. This dishonesty strengthens the conventional wisdom.
This process explains why the public overestimates al Qaeda's menace. In its history, it has killed about one-tenth the number of Americans that die annually from the flu. Even in the Taliban's Afghanistan, it never came close to acquiring nuclear or biological weapons. Though friendly militias have harbored al Qaeda in western Pakistan since late 2001, the group has not launched another successful attack against U.S. territory. Opinion polls suggest that the jihadist movement that spawned al Qaeda is waning — unsurprisingly, for an unappealing ideology that considers even most Muslims legitimate targets for murder.
The exaggerated fear of al Qaeda creates a sellers' market for policies advertised as confronting terrorism, like surging troops in Afghanistan. Without threat inflation, the war flunks a simple cost-benefit analysis. Nearly 500 coalition troops have died fighting this year. By some estimates, sending another 40,000 troops to Afghanistan will bring the war's cost to about $100 billion a year, and that's not even counting long-term expenses like veteran's care, and investments foregone at home. Given a realistic threat assessment, it is hard to see how a drawdown in Afghanistan would allow al Qaeda to do enough damage to justify these costs. That's true even if you grant hawks their questionable assumptions that our troops don't just inflame the Pashtun separatism that fuels the Taliban and that Afghan Taliban commanders would again harbor al Qaeda.
The Belichick controversy suggests a possible solution. By drawing attention to analysis that challenged conventional wisdom, the debate convinced some fans, including me, that the coach was right. Growing dissent could encourage more coaches to go for it. Likewise, iconoclasm in foreign policy debate, abetted by events, can change public opinion and empower doves. The purpose of political science ought to be to provide its own version of AdvancedNFLStats, directed toward the national interest. Belichick has long provided a blueprint for how to win football games — given help, their rational approach can also provide insight into how protect America.
Kevin Gates, Sheck Wes, Youngboy Never Broke Again, Bhad Bhabie and Blueface will also be in the building.

Would you insert watered down feces from your partner, parent, or even a total stranger into your anus? For a growing number of people, the answer is an enthusiastic “Yes!”
“Fecal transplants are exploding,” says Lawrence Brandt, emeritus chief of the Division of Gastroenterology at Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, who has been administering the treatment since 1999. The treatment — also called bacteriotherapy — is gaining momentum, and Dr. Brandt says they frequently receive calls from interested doctors and patients alike.
Fecal transplants are most commonly used to treat the bacterium Clostridium difficile, a normally harmless organism often found in the gastrointestinal tract. When patients are exposed to antibiotics that disrupt their balance of gut microbes, C. difficile populations can flare up and cause symptoms ranging from diarrhea to life-threatening colon inflammation. Antibiotics are normally used for treatment, but since the early 2000s C. difficile has become more virulent thanks to random genetic shifts, and the infection has extended into populations it previously spared, like younger people who are not on antibiotics. A hypervirulent strain of the bacteria produces 20 times the amount of toxins than its non-hypervirulent ancestors did.
So how do you know if a fecal transplant is right for you?
For now, the most encouraging data apply to people with recurrent cases of C. difficile. For the approximately 325 cases worldwide treated with fecal transplants, about 89 percent reported no relapse of C. difficile and no side effects. Dr. Brandt recently presented the results of a study on 77 fecal transplant patients at the meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology. They followed the patients for a minimum of three months, and 91 percent had no relapse of C. difficile. For the remaining patients who didn't respond fully to fecal transplant, a second treatment or an additional regime of antibiotics boosted the efficacy to 98.3 percent. These patients had symptoms of C. difficile for an average of 11 months prior to fecal transplant, and following the transplant most were relieved of symptoms within three days.
Dr. Colleen Kelly, a gastroenterologist at Mariam Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island, has performed fecal transplants on 45 patients to date, ranging in age from 19 to 91. They treat only the “worst of the worst,” or those who have failed with normal antibiotics and are on their third C. difficile infection relapse or else have relapsed severely twice. So far, their results have been “incredible,” they say, with a 98 percent overall success rate. They say they don't think she's ever encountered a treatment as effective and has “never had a more grateful group of patients.”
Some patients suffering from ulcerative colitis or irritable bowel syndrome seek out the treatment, though fewer data exist for these groups. Dr. Kelly says they don't feel comfortable performing the procedure for those diseases since the data aren't as compelling and those conditions are much more complicated than a C. difficile infection.
The field still lacks any randomized control trials, so all results are considered observational at this point, and this is a point of contention for some experts. William Schaffner, the chair of the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, says they “would send up a yellow caution light” about the “arcane” therapy. We are now beyond the era of anecdotal medicine, Dr. Schaffner says, and rigorous controlled studies are needed in order to determine whether or not the treatment is effective and to make sure the benefits outweigh the risks. Without standardized methods of performing the procedure, pathogens from a potentially asymptomatic donor could be transferred to the recipient.
“There [are] definitely doctors who have reservations” about fecal transplantation, Dr. Kelly says.
Physicians fearing the transfer of infectious organisms is “ridiculous,” thinks Dr. Brandt. “That attitude would be costing people months of needless expense, discomfort, and risk from their disease” which could be alleviated with a fecal transplant. They say that regularly screening fecal donors for infectious organisms is a simple solution.
Dr. Schaffner points out that some microbes like norovirus, which cause acute gastroenteritis are not screened for, but Dr. Kelly insists that outside of an outbreak setting, it would be rare for someone to carry such a virus and not be symptomatic. In addition to screening donors' blood for diseases like HIV and hepatitis, they test their stool for bacterial pathogens, giardia and cryptosporidium, parasites, and C. difficile. “We can't entirely eliminate the risks, but we can greatly reduce them with proper donor screening,” they say.
Dr. Kelly noticed some Internet blogs discuss methods for do-it-yourself fecal transplants at home, which they would never recommend.
Fecal transplants cost essentially nothing, especially when compared to Vancomycin — a common C. difficile antibiotic — which runs about $55 per pill for a medication regime of four pills daily for two weeks. For doctors operating a business, handing out free fecal transplants isn't a sustainable model, though an application is currently in the works to get a fecal transplant billing code. At their clinic in the Bronx, Dr. Brandt only charges for diagnostic services but not for the time it takes to prepare and administer the stool. “I didn't go into medicine to make a profit, I did it to make a difference,” they say.
To perform the treatment, Dr. Brandt collects soft, fresh stool from a donor, mixes it in a saline solution to create a suspension, then filters it to remove particulate matter. In the end, he's left with a brownish watery liquid that is injected into the colons of theirs patients.
In the future, Dr. Brandt envisions an oral capsule form of the treatment, which would be more aesthetically appealing and equally effective. Doctors still don't understand which stool components are responsible for combating bacteria like C. difficile, but if these could be narrowed down, then a more focused treatment composed of only critical species could be designed.
To Dr. Brandt, fecal transplants' clinical possibilities are numerous, including treatments for other gastrointestinal diseases like irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, and ulcerative colitis. They even see potential for treatment of non-bowel related disease, like morbid obesity, Parkinson's, and autism. Dr. Kelly says fecal transplants may play some role with these diseases in the future, but it's going to require many more studies.
For now, though, data supporting fecal transplants are still mostly confined to cases involving recurrent C. difficile, and are still entirely observational. Without randomized control trials where neither patient nor physician knows whether the patient is receiving treatment or a placebo, Dr. Schaffner says the trials “leave us forever with the question of: Does it really work?” Medical history, they remind, is full of examples of enthusiasts attaining positive results, but that “those successes don't always hold up in the hands of others.”
Dr. Kelly and Dr. Brandt are currently applying to the National Institutes of Health to get funding for a randomized controlled trial, which they hope will scientifically prove the therapy's effectiveness and gain its endorsement by the medical community.
For patients suffering from chronically recurring C. difficile infection, this treatment may be helpful and worth a try since few side effects have been observed. Like every medical procedure, though, there's always a risk involved. For those dealing with other bowel syndromes, it's probably too early to tell if fecal transplants can be a viable treatment option, and consumers should wait for controlled trails.

Summary
In this glimpse into the next quarter century, we forecast several significant changes and disruptions in the global structure, which will be summarized here. However, one fact that will not change is the United States' position as the sole global power. Over the next 25 years, it will adopt a new strategy to maintain power at the lowest possible cost. This strategy will resemble isolationism, in that the U.S. will not be drawn into regional military conflicts in any significant capacity. The U.S. will support its allies with supplies, training and some air power, however, it will contain regional problems in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, rather than directly and forcibly engaging. This will prove to be a prudent strategy and help the U.S. sustain its global dominance.
In Europe, the European Union as an institution will collapse or redefine itself as a more modest trade zone encompassing a smaller part of the continent. The current free trade structure is unsustainable because its members, particularly Germany, have grown overly dependent on exports. This dependency makes these economies extremely vulnerable to fluctuations in demand outside of their own borders. Germany is the most vulnerable country and will experience economic decline due to inevitable fluctuations in the export market. Consequently, by 2040, Germany will be a second-tier power in Europe. Other countries in Western Europe will be affected by its decline, leading Central Europe, and Poland in particular, to emerge as a major, active power.
Russia will continue to suffer from the effects of declining oil prices. The revenue from this commodity had been used to sustain internal cohesion. With this revenue now severely drained, Russia will devolve into a confederation or even fragment into secessionist parts by 2040. The future of Russian nuclear weapons will become a crucial strategic issue as this devolution takes place.
In Asia, as the decline of China's competitiveness in the export market continues, high unemployment will become a significant challenge to the Chinese president. The regime will attempt to survive the economy's downward spiral by tightening its grip on power and sliding back into dictatorship. However, the regional divergences in China are too widespread and not easily suppressed by dictatorship. Therefore, by 2040, China will see a return to regionalism, accompanied by turmoil. As China weakens, a power vacuum will emerge in East Asia, which will be filled by Japan. By 2040, Japan, with its enormous economy and substantial military capabilities, will become the leading East Asian power.
In the Middle East, we do not foresee Islamic State being sufficiently contained in the coming decades. On the contrary, it is likely to expand its territory. Turkey and Iran are the only regional actors with the capability to challenge IS, and Iran is unlikely to do so in any substantial way. Given Islamic State's territorial aspirations, Turkey will have to engage militarily to defend its borders. As Turkey asserts its military and economic strength, these developments will effectively bring a return of the Ottoman Empire, thrusting Turkey back into the position as the dominant regional power by 2040.
To summarize, the dominant theme we see playing out over the course of the next 25 years is increasing disarray in Europe and Asia, contrasted by prolonged stability in North American and Latin America. Despite the growing unsteadiness in Eurasia, we also expect to see three regional powers emerge: Japan, Turkey and Poland. These countries will be outliers in an otherwise fragmented Eastern Hemisphere.
Main Forecasts:
• The main trend over the next quarter of a century will be the continued and intensifying instability in the Eastern Hemisphere and increasing stability in the Western Hemisphere.
• Over the next 25 years, the United States will remain the world's sole global power.
• The U.S. will adopt a new strategy of maintaining power at the lowest possible cost, eschewing direct military intervention for containing regional problems and supporting allies.
• The European Union cannot maintain its free trade dimension and, since that dimension is at the heart of the EU, the union itself, including the euro, will at the very least contract geographically and will more likely disappear.
• The EU will redefine itself as a more modest trade zone encompassing a smaller part of the continent.
• Germany is the most vulnerable country to the coming EU collapse. The country will experience economic decline due to inevitable fluctuations in the export market, on which it is heavily dependent. By 2040, Germany will be a second-tier power in Europe.
• The rest of northwestern Europe, excluding Britain, will also experience a decline, linked to Germany's slump. Power and economic dynamism will, therefore, shift away from Western Europe and to Central Europe.
• Poland will emerge as a major, active power in Europe.
• Well before 2040, Russia will at best operate as if it is a confederation, with regions linked but not under Moscow's control. Alternatively, this may be combined with genuine secession of various regions, particularly in the High Caucasus, the Pacific Maritime region and Karelia. Whatever the details, the likelihood of Russia remaining intact is low.
• China's economy has been showing signs of slowing growth and, by 2040, the country will see a return to regionalism, accompanied by turmoil.
• As China weakens, a power vacuum will emerge in East Asia, which will be filled by Japan. By 2040, Japan, with its enormous economy and substantial military capabilities, will become the leading East Asian power.
• Islamic State will not be sufficiently contained in the coming decades.
• Islamic State's strength will be a challenge when its reach goes beyond the frontiers of the major powers. All of its opponents will react at that time, but only two are capable of extended offensive activity: Iran and Turkey.
• By 2040, we expect Turkey to be forced into the position of challenging the Islamic State. This situation will be, in effect, the return of the Ottoman Empire in Arab territory.
• In an operation against IS, we expect Turkey to be successful, but its success would draw Turkey into an occupation that it could not easily withdraw from.
Other Forecasts:
• The U.S. strategy with Russia from now until 2040 is to confront Moscow with a line of resistance (which includes the Baltic states, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria) without itself becoming overly exposed.
• By the mid-2020s, both Germany and Russia will grow weaker and, while Poland may not surge by itself, its relative weight will increase dramatically.
• Russian military might will increase in the early phases of its terminal crisis causing tensions with Poland, but will fade as its core economic and political problems become less manageable.
• The future of Russian nuclear weapons will become a crucial strategic issue as the country's devolution takes place.
• The contraction in oil revenue will have long-term consequences in Russia. There will neither be sufficient resources for Moscow to sustain the region, nor an effective security apparatus to compel unity.
• The emergence of new economic powers, which will certainly happen in the next 25 years, is likely to be matched with new sources of energy, including hydrocarbons and others.
• As mentioned previously, Turkey will be forced to assert its military and economic strength against IS and other challengers, thrusting Turkey into the position of being the dominant regional power by 2040. This power will not be limited to the south, but will extend to the northwest into the Balkans and north into the Black Sea Basin.
• Some areas that are currently not seen as globally significant will emerge as economic powers, if not yet strategic challenges to the United States. They will be the high-growth, low-wage countries and, in many cases, simultaneously advanced industrial countries.
• As the Western Hemisphere grows increasingly stable compared to the Eastern Hemisphere, Latin America will be in a strikingly important position. However, it is still in an early stage of development that will likely last until 2040 for most countries.
• As Eurasia's fragmentation continues, the logical outcome is the rotation of powers. At or near the periphery of a severely weakened Eurasia, we expect to see three regional powers emerge, as described already above: Japan will return to being the major East Asian power; Turkey will be the dominant power in the Middle East; and Poland, leading a coalition from the Baltics to the Black Sea, will become a major player in Europe.
• From Europe to China, there are extraordinarily capable and creative populations that will continue to create wealth for themselves and others. But all of these countries – with the exception of India, which is already divided in many ways – are undergoing a process of fragmentation that will reduce their weight in the international system.

Violence is in the air these days. It was visible to the world in Manchester, Birmingham and London in the days before the British general election June 8. It was visible on the baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia, on Wednesday morning as a Donald Trump hater and Bernie Sanders volunteer took a rifle and shot House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and three others while Republicans were practicing for Thursday's congressional ballgame.
Violence is increasingly visible from, or threatened by, ski-masked, hammer-armed antifas -- people employing fascist-style intimidation on those who disagree -- on campuses from Berkeley to New England and in the streets of "cool cities" such as Portland. Contrary to mainstream media expectations, the violence and threats come almost entirely from the political left, not the right.
Sanders immediately issued a strong statement denouncing violence. That's in character. They had also called for free speech on campus when Ann Coulter was barred from Berkeley, as did fellow left-wingers Elizabeth Warren and Maxine Waters. That's in line with longtime liberal tradition yet contrary to the policies and actions of so many college and university administrators these days.
Unfortunately, it's not hard to find left-wing tweets advocating violence against President Trump and Republicans. And the "arts" community contributes its share. Comedian Kathy Griffin posted a picture of themselves holding a likeness of the bloody severed head of the president. In New York, Shakespeare in the Park's staging of "Julius Caesar" features an orange-haired Caesar being stabbed to death by political rivals.
And there have been multiple violent threats and some actual instances of violence against Republican House members. Virginia's Tom Garrett canceled town halls in response to a message that said, "This is how we're going to kill your wife." The message to upstate New York's Claudia Tenney was, "One down, 216 to go."
A Tucson school official was arrested for threatening that Arizona's Martha McSally's "days are numbered." A woman was charged with a felony of reckless endangerment for trying to drive Tennessee's David Kustoff's car off the road.
Not all the violence has come from people on the left. Just before a May 25 special election, Montana Republican candidate Greg Gianforte body-slammed a reporter who was questioning them persistently. They won anyway and apologized at their victory party. Charged with assault, they were sentenced to 40 hours of community service and, unprompted, contributed $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists, a worthy cause.
Some will say that this is a natural reaction to Trump's offenses against propriety and the allegedly harmful policies they and congressional Republicans support. Certainly, Trump has repeatedly transgressed long-standing political etiquette, and in ways that often harm them and their party more than their opponents. Their tweet about having tapes in the White House motivated James Comey, according to their own account, to leak information to The New York Times in the hope that it would prompt the appointment of a special prosecutor.
Which it did, even though regulations limit such appointments to criminal cases and the investigation of Russian involvement in our election is an intelligence investigation in which, as far as we know, there is no indication that anyone committed a crime.
Trump's violations of political protocol have also sparked a political backlash. It hasn't resulted in a Republican defeat yet in congressional special elections -- all so far in districts Trump carried handily -- but it could in the runoff next Tuesday for the seat representing Georgia's 6th District.
That seat, in the northern Atlanta suburbs, is packed with affluent college graduates. Last year, it gave Trump only a 1.5 percentage-point edge, in contrast with the 20-point margins Republicans usually win there. Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff nearly won the seat by getting 48 percent of the vote in the April 18 all-party primary against multiple Republicans. They have led Republican Karen Handel by an average of 3 points in recent polling.
Even if Ossoff loses, a close race in such a district spells trouble for Republicans. It suggests that they can't count on traditional margins -- that they only can count on Trump's much lower numbers -- for such upscale seats. The good news for Republicans is that Democrats already hold most of these districts outside the South.
The political process provides avenues for those opposed to Trump or Republican policies. Too many Americans have convinced themselves that they are morally entitled to use violence to "resist," as if Trump were some reincarnation of Adolf Hitler.
As I write, the congressional baseball game is scheduled to go on Thursday night. Is there a chance we can return to normal, nonviolent politics, as well?
Unlike software, which barrages us with an endless flow of updates, hardware's functionalities are often frozen on the production line. The Jambox you see on shelves, is the Jambox you get, aside from the occasional, basic firmware update.
It's the woe of many a gadget lover: You buy a device only to find mere months later a newer, cooler version is being released. Instead of evolving with us, our gadgets become obsolete – a majorly missed opportunity according to a new company called Binauric.
The Germany-based company has created the Boom Boom, a Bluetooth speaker that will acquire new functionalities the longer you own it. “We always felt that hardware was missing this evolutionary factor,” says Markku Palipea, co-founder of Binauric. “So in the beginning we asked ourselves, what potentially could a speaker be capable of?”
When you purchase the Boom Boom, a polygonal speaker designed by French designer Mathieu Lehanneur, it comes with all the basic features you'd expect: audio playback, conference call capabilities, the option to sync up two speakers.
But in a clever move, Binauric loaded the speaker with excess components like an accelerometer, light sensors and microphones that allow the device to take on new functionalities as they're developed. “These are like sleeping components that are waiting to be woken up,” Lehanneur explains.
Think of the Boom Boom as a platform: The base device to facilitate a bunch of sound-based capabilities.
For instance, in a few months Binauric plans to roll out an app-controlled recording feature, which will allow people to record voices and environmental sound. Outside of this recording functionality, there's no set roadmap for the product. Instead, Binauric is hoping its customers will dictate what the device should be able to do.

“We have a long list of potential features we think is cool, but it's really not up to us,” says Palipea. “What we really want to implement is what our users want,” adds Pierre-Henri Samion, another co-founder at Binauric.
Lehanneur imagines that someday the Boom Boom might not just play music, but make it too, using the capabilities of the accelerometer. “You can easily imagine if you're listening to music and you shake the speaker, you could transform the music,” they say. Juggling then, could diffuse the baseline, or flashing a light at the speaker's light sensor could cause the music to speed up or slow down.
These ideas are unrealized at the moment, but they give you a glimpse into the possibilities. Binauric has already given the Boom Boom to students at Lausanne's ECAL University, who they hope will tear the device apart and hack their way into totally new use cases. “They've been trying to see how light and gravity can affect sound,” says Palipea. “They're really going nuts with it–but that's exactly what we want at the start.”
Binauric is set on learning from its users, which is actually a smart move for a hardware company. By building in components from the start, the Boom Boom doesn't limit itself, or its shelf life—a valuable thing for a company looking to resonate with consumers who are used to responsive, ultra-personalized gadgets. “We don't want it to be something you just buy then toss aside,” says Palipea.
FILE PHOTO - Then FBI Director Robert Mueller testifies at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, Thomson Reuters
WASHINGTON — A group of Republicans will take the House floor Tuesday evening to call for the recusal of Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Louie Gohmert of Texas, and Jim Jordan of Ohio will use the House floor as a platform to raise awareness on the resolution they introduced last week, which claims Mueller's impartiality is compromised because of a separate investigation of Russian nationals during their tenure as FBI director.
Gaetz and their colleagues who signed on to the resolution say that because Mueller did not file charges in the investigation of the sale of Uranium One, a Canadian energy company that held some operations in the US, to a Russian nuclear energy firm, they should not be overseeing the investigation of Russian interference in the election. Charges were ultimately filed against several individuals when James Comey succeeded Mueller as FBI director. Some on the right have tied the deal to Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state when it went through.
In addition to Mueller's recusal, Gaetz wants further investigation of the Uranium One deal, including the appointment of a new special counsel. But Gaetz told Business Insider in an interview Tuesday that it is unclear who could even mount an investigation.
"I'm a member of the Judiciary Committee and I cannot tell you who has jurisdiction or authority right now to do a Uranium One investigation," Gaetz said. "When I asked the Attorney General, they said that any issues regarding Uranium One fell under their recusal and they departed the room when I was insisting that a special counsel be appointed."
Gaetz said they spoke to Attorney General Jeff Sessions in September, and has since given notice to the White House, but has yet to hear back.
The Uranium One deal, which some Republicans and pundits have been pushing as a major scandal, has gained very little traction outside of the far-right echo chamber. Picking apart the Uranium One deal has been a regular staple on Fox News' primetime lineup and has received attention from President Donald Trump as of late.
"Uranium deal to Russia, with Clinton help and Obama Administration knowledge, is the biggest story that Fake Media doesn't want to follow!" Trump wrote on Twitter in October.
As for Mueller, many prominent Republicans have expressed confidence in their impartiality. A bipartisan group of senators has even pushed to put protections in place in the event Trump attempts to oust him.
And House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Fox News Sunday, "We need to let these career professionals do their jobs, see it through."
"So, no, I don't think they should be stepping down, and I don't think they should be fired," Ryan said. "And the President has made it clear, he's not going to do that."
Nevertheless, Gaetz and the team of Republicans are pressing forward.
"I think I've got a challenge ahead to educate my colleagues on the depth of Mr. Mueller's conflicts of interest," Gaetz said.
How to use VueJS transition to create a Text Animation with Clipping Paths
Click the toggle button to see what happeneds.
See the Pen Text animation vue.js by Mattia Vorstenbosch (@iPrime) on CodePen.
Slick animation huh? Let's see how we do it. it's surprisingly easy 🙂
Getting Started
First of all with every vue project you need to create your vue instance. for more information on how to set up vue.js read their Vue installation docs.
new Vue({ el: '#demo', data: { // "show" is our boolean that we will use to toggle the text elements show: true } })
HTML
Next up we're creating our HTML. Let's create a button with a “v-on:click” event to toggle our “show” boolean. Wrap your content into the div with id=”demo”, remember we created a vue instance applied to “#demo”.
<div id="demo"> <button v-on:click="show = !show"> Toggle </button> </div>
Now let's add our text with a class “myText” and wrap our text with a “transition” element and give it a name=”myTransition”.
<div id="demo"> <button v-on:click="show = !show"> Toggle </button> <transition name="myTransition"> <p v-show="show" class="myText">Animation</p> </transition> </div>
CSS
Finally some CSS! In order to make the text seem to disappear behind a mask we have to create a clip-path.
.myText { /* this clip-path creates a perfect match with the element */ clip-path: polygon(0% 0%, 100% 0%, 100% 100%, 0% 100%); }
What this essentially does is creating a path around our text as shown here:
Note: the yellow lines and points are edited in for clarification, this is NOT how it looks like in the browser.
We're going to animate the text in the Y direction. Essentially 100% down by
transform: translate(0%, 100%).
While at the same time we are animating the clip-path to close. Creating the mask effect where the text ‘disappears'.
Vue.js has this built in transition element that takes care of the class handling. Here's why we named our transition “myTransition”. Vue takes this name and uses it to create and add classes to the desired html element, in our case the text element. Vue will automatically sniff whether the target element has CSS transitions or animations applied. If it does, CSS transition classes will be added/removed at appropriate timings.
in short. Vue creates those classes. all we need to do is define them in our CSS as follows:
.myTransition-enter-active, .myTransition-leave-active { transition: all .5s ease-out; } .myTransition-enter, .myTransition-leave-to { clip-path: polygon(0% 0%, 100% 0%, 100% 0%, 0% 0%); transform: translate(0%, 100%); }

Late last week JC Decaux and the City of Paris launched a french and english site to coincide with the announcement that the two would be opening up key Vélib' data, which includes statistics on stations (ie location) as well as real-time data. Now comes the announcement that the two will be teaming up with SNCF and RATP to launch a big open data challenge called Moov'In the City whereby participants will have two months to create web services, applications, and/or datavisualizations that help facilitate people's daily commutes and other trips around the Paris metro area.
The challenge will actually last two months and will kick off at 17h on May 21st at the competition's launch event. At the event, the organizers will reveal all of the data at the participants' disposal and the attendees will be able to share initial ideas and start to form teams. Access to Vélib's API and the City of Paris' API, Paris' open data site http://opendata.paris.fr, as well as, presumably, SNCF's and RATP's APIs and data, will serve as the foundation. In the weeks following the first event, participating teams will have the possibility to join the city's ‘Moov'In the City' incubator where they will receive technical, marketing and design coaching from experts at BeMyApp and other event partners. At the mid-point, there will be a check-in meeting during Futur en Seine where the teams will be able to get expert advice and do a test pitch with a panel of experts. The grande finale will take place in early July and a jury will crown the winners across a few categories, awarding at least 25,000 euros in prizes.
If you want to participate, you can register for the launch event and conference on May 21st here.
Moov'In the City is actually an important part of a broader agenda of events in 2013 focusing on data and its usage, which also includes the multi-activity information, digital and design expo Expo'viz by La Fonderie as well as other hackathons, conferences, etc.
It's common for Smalltalk implementations to run on multiple platforms, and that leads to the problem of designing a framework to allow an application UI to display on all those platforms. The existing solutions (not only in Smalltalk) suffer from various shortcomings. In order to solve this problem better, Brazil from the start was based on a number of principles different from the industry examples. Here is an overview of those principles.
It's not about widgets. A UI framework is not (just) a widget library. In that sense, Morphic is on the right track (and in the mainstream, so is WPF). Interfaces visualize information, and a good interactive visualization is typically more than a window with a few labels and list boxes plopped onto it. A UI framework needs to do much of what was traditionally expected from a structured graphics (“diagramming”) framework. Of course, buttons, list boxes and other primitive interactive elements are still necessary, but the value of a framework is primarily in composing rather than in implementing them. Which, in fact, it shouldn't do at all.
When it's about widgets, it's about native widgets. Any OS provides about the same core set of primitive interactive elements. They are what the users expect to see in a “real program”, and the OS by definition does a better job implementing them than anyone could ever hope to. Emulated widgets are bound to be a poor replica of the original and are thus an exercise in futility. On the way from Smalltalk-80, one attraction of the emulated approach might have been the ability to customize, extend and roll your own, for the sake of creating more expressive UIs. But when a UI framework is also a graphics framework, expressive UIs can be built by composition rather than by widget hacking—so there really is no good reason not to use what's already available, even if its implementation is sealed inside the OS.
Cross-platform shouldn't mean platform-agnostic. So what about the lowest common denominator problem? It's often assumed that using native widgets in a cross-platform environment means that only the subset of their features common across all platforms can be accessible. The mistake of this view is the assumption that it's not cross-platform unless the user is shielded from platform differences. It doesn't have to be that way, and shouldn't be. Platforms are different, and a properly designed cross-platform framework should embrace and model those differences rather than try and inevitably fail creating an illusion that they do not exist. In practice, such modeling means that a framework object that represents a widget can provide access to the lowest common denominator features, while platform-specific features can be available as a “capability”—a separate object one can fetch from the widget when the capability is available (i.e. when the current platform is the one whose capabilities you ask for).
Qt is not your friend. It's a common and understandable question—why not use an existing cross-platform framework like Qt or wxWidgets. Everything that has been said above is reason enough, and another important consideration is that a large complex hard-to-debug third party layer shielding you from the OS facilities you want to use sounds like bad news (something I dubbed as “high Space Shuttle factor” in the original implementation study). Which is also related to the last point.
If it's not written in Smalltalk, it's broken. There is a tendency (at least in Smalltalk-80 descendants) to do OS interaction through primitives. That is so perhaps because FFI arrived relatively late to ObjectWorks, and never was available for Squeak. Primitives are an arcane enough feature, so they are not discussed in Smalltalk style guides. If they were, the guides might have said something like this: many primitives you see in VisualWorks and Squeak should not have existed. A primitive is supposed to do what cannot be expressed in Smalltalk. If a call out to the OS or a call back from the OS cannot be expressed in Smalltalk, you need an FFI, not a VM plugin. OS interaction is not something that belongs in a primitive—and if fact, a primitive is about the worst place to do that kind of work. It means writing a large body of complex code in a low-level language with a higher probability of making a mistake, and then hiding it away in the VM where it can't be easily debugged and fixed. Hardly a winning combination.
Monday on Fox Sports 1's “Undisputed,” co-host Shannon Sharpe criticized Pittsburgh Steelers tackle and former Army Ranger and Afghan war veteran Alejandro Villanueva's decision to go “rogue” by going onto the field Sunday to stand for the national anthem before the team's game with the Chicago Bears, despite the team's vote to remain in the locker room.
“I believe they were wrong in this situation,” stated Sharpe. “I believe they put their personal feelings and beliefs in front of that of the team.”
They continued, “If a team took a vote and said this is what we're going to do, although I understand that they served in the military, I commend them for their service, but this is a team and the team said this is what we're going to do, we criticize so many athletes when they put their goals, their views, their ideas in front of the team. Well, that's what they did. They said forget what you guys said, this is what I'm going to do.”

The Versions of Android Used by Redditors
Arthur Himmel (TechGlobe) Blocked Unblock Follow Oct 22, 2015
About a month ago (September 13th to be precise) I made a survey on the subreddit /r/samplesize asking people what version of Android they used. The survey got a lot of responses and I (and many people who commented on the survey) wanted to publish the results and put them into a visualisation. Possibly posting that visualisation on /r/dataisbeautiful (though this probably won't be making it to the top of that sub because it doesn't mention Bernie Sanders). I was getting ready to start working on a bigger dataviz project. So I thought that finally getting around to it now would be a great way to start getting the hang of Tableau Public and other dataviz stuff. Anyway, here's the raw data followed by the visualisation itself.
The raw data:
Total responses: 329
Lollipop (5.0–5.1): 222 (~67%)
KitKat (4.4): 64 (~19%)
Jelly Bean (4.1–4.3): 16 (~5%)
Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0): 13 (~4%)
Something older than all of these (may god have mercy on your soul): 8 (~2%)
Marshmallow Preview (6.0 Beta): 6 (~2%)
The visualization itself (imgur link):
Keep in mind this isn't the most up-to-date data because Marshmellow just released, but I still think it's cool.
I've been doing some thinking over the last few weeks, and I've decided a few things—I am exercising whatever free will have
First, I am no longer interested in describing this predictable human atrocity or that one. I have done that lately out of feelings of overwhelming disgust, a typical human emotion. Political corruption? Destruction of the biosphere? Grotesque income and wealth inequality everywhere? Grinding, hopeless poverty in the "wealthy nations" (United States and Europe)? Partying Davos elites planning our future?
We all know about these ongoing human-caused catastrophes, and, predictably, they are all getting worse in what is now a global economy. Does more need to be said about how disgusting all this is?
No. Fuck that.
The only subject now worth my time is trying to explain how the human animal functions. In so doing, one attempts to explain to other "conscious" people why the human condition is basically a crock of shit. The few people who "get" that are the only ones worth talking to. Everybody else is part of the problem.
Toward that end, I would like to introduce the work of cognitive neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga, who heads the SAGE Center for the Study of Mind at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
IRVINE — There are all sorts of paths to the NFL, Travis Wilson trying to find one right now as a tight end running the most slanted of routes.
Or maybe you think it's completely normal to go from selling flip-flops to the public to huddling with the Rams.
“Not your typical story going into the NFL,” Wilson said. “I'm definitely grateful for this opportunity.”
Around the league this summer, there aren't many underdogs easier to root for than this one, Wilson just one of three former Pac-12 quarterbacks in Rams camp, though he's the only one currently catching passes.
Following their time at San Clemente High and the University of Utah, Wilson signed as a free agent in February after switching positions but refusing to budge from their dream of making the NFL.
That's a desire that never wavered, even as Wilson took a job at Toes on the Nose, which sits right on Pacific Coast Highway in Laguna Beach.
The surf shop is owned by John Allred, who coached Wilson at San Clemente, and served as a perfect place to work while they were back at home and remaking themselves as a football player.
“It's definitely a humbling experience,” Wilson, 23, said. “But I was really happy to get that job and make a little extra money.”
About seven months ago, Wilson began working out with quarterback coach Jordan Palmer, who played in the NFL and had trained Wilson in the past.
Each session, they would spend 45 minutes doing quarterback drills and 45 minutes doing receiver drills, Wilson aware that changing positions might be their better NFL option.
Among the players throwing to them then was Deshaun Watson, another Palmer client who had just won a national championship at Clemson and was about to be a first-round pick of the Houston Texans.
Even though Wilson, at that point, was nowhere near the NFL, they were close enough to NFL talent to appreciate what they were pursuing.
Their college career having ended with a victory in the 2015 Las Vegas Bowl, Wilson spent time in a minicamp with the Cincinnati Bengals but never advanced farther.
At one point, they signed with the National Gridiron League, a developing venture in Australia, only to see the operation fold about a month before it was supposed to begin.
They also are being courted by an Australian Rules Football team, the Essendon Bombers, who were interested in Wilson as a ruckman, despite the fact they didn't even know what a ruckman is.
Turns out, at 6-foot-7, Wilson was appealing because a ruckman's duties include going high in the air to catch the ball.
The Bombers sent Wilson apparel and footballs, and they tried to learn more about the game from one of their old college roommates, Tom Hackett, an Australian who earned national recognition punting at Utah.
Essendon asked Wilson to shoot video of themselves kicking and catching the ball, the possibilities intriguing enough that the Aussies were willing to scout them from roughly 8,000 miles away.
“I was thinking about giving it a go,” they said. “But it would have been tough because I never played the sport.”
Instead, Wilson's progress as a tight end reached the point where Palmer helped arrange a tryout with the Rams, who were clearly intrigued by the possibilities, too, only from a much more manageable proximity.
Wilson signed without having to audition for any other teams, a bit of a rarity for an undrafted free agent looking for a chance.
“Since nothing really was working out for me as a quarterback, I think the position change was kind of a no-brainer,” they said. “I was really happy to move on and try something new.”
Now, he's here at UC Irvine, running routes for Jared Goff (Cal) and Sean Mannion (Oregon State), both of whom Wilson matched up against as Utah's quarterback.
Their path is an unlikely one, all right, one that led them on the final play of practice Tuesday to the back of the end zone, where Wilson leapt from the crowd to secure a scoring pass, exactly the kind of play the Essendon Bombers would have applauded.
“It's definitely weird to be catching balls from them now,” Wilson said of Goff and Mannion. “But we're all good friends. We have a pretty good Pac-12 connection going.”
Plenty of college quarterbacks have made it to the NFL at other positions, the current glowing example being Julian Edelman, who went from calling signals at Kent State to hoisting Super Bowl trophies as a receiver with New England.
And, like Edelman, Wilson was known as a runner as well as a passer in college, Wilson's distinctly downhill style earning them a nickname among the Utes their first-year student year: “Bulldog.”
Their favorite college player was Tim Tebow because, Wilson once explained, “he runs over people.” At San Clemente, Wilson knocked an opposing cornerback out of the game by lowering their shoulder going for the goal line.
“I'm not one to shy away from contact,” said the former Pop Warner League middle linebacker, who today is listed at 258 pounds. “I've been that way since I was growing up. That's still in my mindset.”
And so is making it to the NFL, one way or another, Wilson's route from surf to turf not at all typical yet altogether terrific.
The surge of children and families crossing the southwest border illegally accelerated again in September, leaving fiscal year 2015 the second-worst on record, according to numbers released Wednesday by the Border Patrol.
Agents caught 4,476 children traveling without parents on the border last month and 5,273 parents and children traveling as families — both of those nearly twice the level of September 2014, suggesting that smugglers have once again stepped up their efforts to entice Central Americans to make the crossing.
It was a disappointing end to a year that began with major drops in illegal crossings, leading officials to say they may have been on track for the lowest pace since the early 1970s.
Instead, the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 with mixed news of a drop in children and families from 2014, but a year-end trend that suggested the problem is far from solved.
Border Patrol officials in Washington blamed violence and poor economic conditions in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras for pushing illegal immigrants to flee their homes and head north, but agents on the ground said the problem is lax U.S. enforcement, which entices migrants to make the dangerous journey, assured that they will be allowed in the U.S. rather than turned away at the border.
“We're talking about the rule of law in other countries; we're not enforcing the rule of law in this country,” Chris Cabrera, an official with the National Border Patrol Council, the labor union for line agents, testified to the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday.
PHOTOS: These celebrities are devoutly Christian — and you probably didn't realize it
Central American families and children caught at the border are given papers setting court dates but are then released into the U.S. The government calls those documents “notices to appear,” but the illegal immigrants regularly refer to them as “permisos,” or free passes, because they give tentative permission to be in the country while they await their court appearances.
“In Border Patrol circles, that paperwork is now known as the ‘notice to disappear' — 80 percent, 90 percent of those folks will not show up for that hearing,” Mr. Cabrera testified.
Illegal immigrants have even begun posting photos of their permisos on social media, telling friends and family how easy it is to gain access to the U.S., investigators told Congress.
In a statement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency that oversees the Border Patrol, said it is aware that smugglers use the promise of permisos to entice people to immigrate, but the agency insisted it is trying to get tough.
“We are closely monitoring current trends and coordinating across the whole of government to ensure an effective response to any changes in migration flows. We continue to aggressively work to secure our borders, address underlying causes and deter future increases in unauthorized migration, while ensuring that those with legitimate humanitarian claims are afforded the opportunity to seek protection,” the agency said.
Officials also said they have begun a public relations campaign to try to discourage illegal crossings.
But the Government Accountability Office, Congress' investigative branch, said Homeland Security began that campaign too late this year and still doesn't have any way of measuring whether the messages are working, or whether they can compete with the social media messages from illegal immigrants.
In fiscal year 2015, border agents caught nearly 40,000 children, down from 68,541 the previous year. Another 40,000 parents and children, down from 68,445 in 2014, were caught traveling together.
But the numbers were heading even lower until late summer when agents suddenly noticed a surge.
The surge is striking because overall illegal crossings of the southwestern border are thought to be down. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said this month that just 331,000 illegal immigrants were caught at the border from Oct. 1, 2014, through Sept. 30, 2015 — down about a third from approximately 479,000 caught a year earlier.
Officials say the number of migrants caught at the border is a good measure of how many are also getting through — so an increase in apprehensions signals an overall increase in the flow.
In court papers this summer, Homeland Security officials argued that part of their success in fighting the surge last year was their get-tough approach on families. Mr. Johnson opened several family detention centers to hold illegal immigrants, making it easier to get them to their court dates and deport them quickly.
But a federal judge has ruled that extended family detention violates a decades-old court settlement and has demanded that Homeland Security change its policies by Friday and more quickly release illegal immigrant families. Homeland Security has warned that could lead to an even bigger surge as smugglers move to exploit the policy.

There's an argument to be made that nothing useful, nothing worthwhile, and certainly nothing great in life arrives without a core central tension having made it possible. No rock band worth anything worked without friction, usually between the key protagonists, the guitarist and the frontman. On going through a very long list of the greatest, it is possible to even argue that no band can ever be great without harbouring at heart a desire to implode, which is as forceful as the desire to create.
The tension is finite. At some point it burns itself out and that, usually, is that. But for its duration, what it does is map out this boundary, as arbitrary as many national boundaries, between greatness and implosion. It is a thin, porous border. Near the edge on one side is the space of a band's greatest work. On the other, kaput, it's over. The tension has eaten them up.
In many ways, the history of Pakistan's best sides mirrors those of the greatest rock bands. Propelled by this central tension to unseen heights before, abruptly, it was too much and they are no more. This leitmotif was laid down at the earliest, when Abdul Hafeez Kardar lorded over every domain in Pakistan cricket, except inside the head of Fazal Mahmood. You may be leading us on to the field, Mahmood used to tell Kardar in grudging acceptance of their status as captain, but I will lead us off it—in a boast of their own capabilities as match-winner.
This was to be the enduring pattern: captain and star man, in cahoots and at odds. Every rivalry has its own identity, its own fuel, and there was a lot going on in that one; personal grudges, class issues, clashing senses of entitlement. In Mahmood, working to prove Kardar inadequate in some way, or at least lesser by comparison, he, of course, elevated him. Mahmood won matches, matches that counted as wins in Kardar's tenure. Neither was happy with the other, but in the end, Pakistan was happy. This was the truth about boxing that Muhammad Ali hit upon in one of those freewheeling rhymes before rap was even a thing: “We gonna get it on, cos we don't get along."

This World Cup represents one last chance for the driving, opposing forces of this mini-age. Four years ago, Shahid Afridi led Misbah-ul-Haq at the World Cup, having just pipped them in the run-in to become leader. This time it is Misbah's turn to lead. They replaced Afridi soon after the last World Cup and has just about held them off since to remain in place. Just recently they overcame a late, nakedly open grab for the post by Afridi. It is a lesser tension than the other examples, but it is there. Relations between the pair are not exactly acrimonious, nor are they exactly harmonious. It has more fizz and life than a drifting marriage, but less than an irreparable one.
Now it used to be that the contrast between any two spheres of power in a Pakistan team was a simple, digestible one. It never was that simple, but it felt like it was easy to break it down that way: posh Kardar, rootsy Fazal; Karachiite Hanif, Lahori Saeed; vilayati Imran, desi Javed; Imran's old favourite Wasim, Imran's new favourite Waqar.
Afridi and Misbah are even more straightforward. How much further, after all, can a contrast be reduced beyond boom boom and tuk tuk? One blaster, one blocker; one action-movie hero, one hushed wildlife-documentary narrator; Afridi rampaging across fields like a cyclone, Misbah drifting over them like a cloud. Misbah represents something older and mannered, a tehzeeb. Afridi represents a present and also future, though the latter is not entirely accurate: They have zipped around on the edge of the future without quite being the future for 20 years now.
In truth the friction between Misbah and Afridi hasn't really helped Pakistan even if, in the 130 One Day International (ODI) matches they have played together, they have won considerably more than they have lost. They have still been, overall, an ordinary One Day team in their time, the pair unable to especially elevate their status or significantly lower it. In fact, it has produced exactly the kind of bipolarity such directly opposing forces might be expected to create. They win like Afridi, they lose like Misbah, but neither identifiably.
Instead, what makes the pair so compelling is what, taken together, they represent: which is either end of a long, middle-less scale. That scale is not just of Pakistan's performance but of the emotion of life—maybe even existence itself—in Pakistan. From the worst of Misbah to the best of Afridi, as a toll for being Pakistani, is perhaps not the same in depth-of-feeling as going from the mass killing of children to, say, Coke Studio. But it is the same, giddying swing, with almost nothing in between the mourning and the celebrating, between despairing at defeat and exulting in triumph.
Together, though, they also represent another notion, of how a particular kind of developing nation progresses or, rather, doesn't. One way to see both would be as separate industries driving economic growth: Afridi as the surging, scary burst of the telecom industry and Misbah as the more sedate, traditional driver, such as agriculture.
But the more revelatory way might be to surmise a co-dependency. Maybe it applies only to Pakistan's model of development but it's impossible not to see the battle between Afridi's urges and Misbah's restraints in macroeconomic terms. Is the pull and push between the pair not similar to, say, the tension between untrammelled zones of free market growth being offset by the overt, suffocating omnipresence of state and bureaucracy?
Free market champions may feel, instinctively, that one is retarding the growth of the other. Statists might counter that some element of oversight and even control is necessary lest free markets veer towards black marketeering tendencies. But, ultimately, the economy goes neither too far forward nor too far back, condemned in the unsatisfactory grey of private-public partnership. How far removed does that sound from the effects of Afridi-Misbah on Pakistan's cricket?
Pakistan are unlikely to win the World Cup (if they win it, Pakistan will have defeated economic theory). This will be the last One Day cricket Misbah and Afridi play, or at least that is what they say. If so, we will finally be rid of that other economic imposition—the zero-sum equation they have created in which to love one, you must hate the other... And Pakistan? Finally, they might move on; though who knows in what shape or direction.

Merkel - German CEOs To Address 99.97% Unemployment Among "Highly Unqualified" Migrants
Zero Hedge ^ | 9-15-2016 | Tyler Durden
Posted on by blam
It's been a bad couple of months for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose approval ratings have fallen sharply over their continued support of open-border immigration policies that have allowed over 1 million refugees to flow into the country since 2015. Increasingly more Germans have blamed Merkel for the surge in refugee terrorist attacks over the past couple of months and have shifted their support to more nationalist-leaning political parties. In fact, just a few weeks ago Merkel suffered a massive, embarrassing defeat in their home state to their nemesis, the anti-immigation AfD party (see "Merkel Stunned By Defeat To Anti-Immigrant Party In Them Home State"). Alas, despite calls from voters for a shift in Germany's immigration policies, Merkel continues to double down.
One of the original selling points for accepting migrants from the Middle East was the apparent economic "benefits" associated with adding 100,000s of new, young consumers/laborers to the German economy. In fact, the wave of new immigrants was sold as the perfect solution for Germany's demographic dilemma which is expected to see its working-age population shrink by 6 million people by 2030.
While it sounded like a great plan, it doesn't really work that well if new migrants fail to find jobs and become economically productive members of society which, according to Reuters, is exactly what is happening. Apparently, German companies have only been able to find jobs for about 100 of the 1 million migrants that have recently found their way into the country.
According to the latest figures from the German Labor Office, about 346,000 people with asylum status were seeking jobs in Germany in August. With 100 migrants actually employed, that's an unemployment rate of about 99.97%.

Bleeding heart socialists seem to have a brain malfunction when it comes to "unintended consequences". I've seen it since the 60's with the failed communes; I continue to see it grow throughout the world. Does the European Union actually believe with their huge welfare states that anyone would bother to get a job? Is there some kind of neuron disconnect in their frontal lobe that kills reasoning? FEELINGS. NOTHING MORE THAN FEELINGS.

Very few of these invaders want to work, not when they can be supported as parasites and have more time to devote to hobbies such as jihad. Of those willing to work, few are qualified for jobs worth doing. As for Merkel and those who voted for them . . .

I have been like a shaken up snowglobe, waiting for the snow pieces to settle back down to the bottom. Hence my disappearance as of late. I have been hoping that the less my life moves, the sooner everything settles.
Have you ever had a crazy time in your life where you are consumed by the insanity that you almost forget what exactly it is that you have been through? I have been slowly able to gradually build back a routine in this new life of mine and this weekend, as I sat in momentary silence, it occurred to me: Son of a Vondruke, my life has been flipped upside down these past 3 months! The amount of changes that I have endured is ridiculous:
A break-up.
Finding my dream job.
A move.
Losing my dream job.
Another move.
Getting accustomed to a new life, new routine, new city
All I can do is pray for the snow to settle quicker.
Especially when I don't want the chocolate to melt all over my fingers…

Ford relies on leather and options for luxury pickup truck 1:35 PM ET Thu, 28 Sept 2017 | 00:38
While pickup truck prices have been rising, the sticker on Ford's newest F-450 raises the bar to a record high.
The 2018 Ford F-450 Super Duty Limited 4X4 will start at $87,100 and will climb to $94,455 for those who select every possible option. Add in tax, title and license fees and some F-450 buyers could wind up paying more than $100,000.
"Super Duty Limited is the most luxurious and advanced heavy-duty pickup truck ever created by Ford for accomplished buyers with appetites for the high life and hard-earned dollars to match," said Todd Eckert, Ford truck group marketing manager.
What will buyers get for spending as much on a truck as they could on a high-end luxury sedan or sports car?
The capability to tow more than 30,000 pounds wrapped in the latest technology and luxury features like Custom Camelback two-tone leather seats, a premium stitched leather-wrapped steering wheel, along with the armrests and instrument panel.
"Imagine opening the door to your humidor and sinking into your favorite leather lounge chair — that's the sensation new Super Duty Limited inspires," said Ford design manager Aileen Barraza.
California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher visited WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London this week, their office confirmed in a statement on Thursday morning.
The meeting, which was first reported by conservative news outlet The Daily Caller, lasted about “three hours,” according to the statement. Assange had wanted to meet with Rohrabacher to tell them that “Russia was not behind” the leaks of Democratic National Committee emails that were hacked during the election.
The US intelligence agencies that assessed the hacks and the leaks concluded unanimously that Russia orchestrated them to damage Hillary Clinton's candidacy and bolster President Donald Trump's campaign.
But Rohrabacher — who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats and has been described as “Putin's favourite member of congress” for their pro-Russia views — said that Assange “emphatically stated that the Russians were not involved in the hacking or disclosure of those emails.”
Their conversation “ranged over many topics, said Rohrabacher, including the status of WikiLeaks, which Assange maintains is vital to keeping Americans informed on matters hidden by their traditional media,” according to their spokesperson, Ken Grubbs. “The member of congress plans to divulge more of what they found directly to President Trump.”
Grubbs told Politico on Monday that Rohrabacher was travelling to London “to meet up with their wife to celebrate their 20th anniversary,” but did not mention the Assange meeting.
The Justice Department has been weighing bringing criminal charges against WikiLeaks, which leaked top secret diplomatic cables and military documents in 2010 and disclosed CIA hacking tools in March.
Rohrabacher, for their part, didn't condemn the self-described transparency organisation when it leaked the tools; rather, they told far-right media outlet Breitbart that the revelations showed that the US is “sliding … into an authoritarian mode where the government is running the lives of the people.”
The CIA, FBI, and NSA concluded in January that WikiLeaks had “actively collaborated” with Russia's “principal international propaganda outlet RT” as the DNC emails were leaked throughout last summer.
Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told their colleagues last year that they think Russian President Vladimir Putin “pays” Rohrabacher, whose contact with and sympathy for pro-Russian entities has long been viewed with suspicion.
A complaint filed with the Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control late last month alleged that Rohrabacher and their staff director, Paul Behrends, violated the Magnitsky Act when they tried to get Russia's deputy general prosecutor, Victor Grin, removed from the US sanctions list last year.
The complaint was filed by US financier Bill Browder, the founder of Hermitage Capital Management, who spearheaded the Magnitsky Act in 2012 to punish Russian officials suspected of being involved in the death of their accountant, Sergey Magnitsky.
Rohrabacher, a staunch defender of Russia and Putin, reportedly met with officials from the prosecutor general's office in Moscow in April 2016 and accepted a “confidential” document that they then used to try to undermine the Magnitsky Act on Capitol Hill.
“Changing attitudes to the Magnitsky story in the Congress … could have a very favourable response from the Russian side,” says the document, which was obtained by Business Insider.
Browder alleged in the July 21 complaint that Rohrabacher “made personal introductions for lobbyists advocating the Russian government's and Grin's position against the Magnitsky Act.”
Those people, according to the complaint, include Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin — both of whom attended a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower last June to discuss a possible repeal of the Magnitsky Act.
Grubbs responded to the complaint by characterising Browder's OFAC filing as an attempt to obfuscate Russia's side of the story and slamming the wealthy investor as “a billionaire tax exile.”

Authorities hope the country's first ivory destruction will help deter smugglers who use the country as a key transit point
Malaysia has destroyed 9.5 tonnes of elephant ivory that it had seized over the years, in a move authorities hope will help deter smugglers who have long used the country as a trans-shipment point.
The huge pile of African elephant tusks, estimated to be worth $20m (£14m), was first fed into in an industrial crusher to be pulverised, and then incinerated in a giant furnace in Port Dickson in southern Malaysia on Thursday.
Malaysia has previously announced in parliament that 4,624 ivory tusks were confiscated between 2011 and 2014.
“This is our first-ever ivory destruction. We want to send a strong message to the world that Malaysia does not compromise in protecting endangered species,” natural resources and environment minister Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar told AFP.
The international ivory trade, with rare exceptions, has been outlawed since 1989 after the population of African elephants declined from millions in the mid-20th century to just 600,000 by the end of the 1980s.
But poachers and smugglers have continued to exploit demand, mainly from Asia and particularly China, where ivory is highly prized for medicinal and decorative uses.
Malaysia, a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), has seized a number of shipments over the years, mostly by sea.
In March, officials said they had confiscated 159kg (350lb) of ivory smuggled by passengers aboard commercial flights.
Wan Junaidi said the tusks destroyed originated from 11 African countries ranging from Ghana to Tanzania.
They were publicly destroyed to deter smugglers, they said, while adding it also was partly in response to questions raised by conservationists over the fate of seized ivory.
“I do not want any of the seized ivory lost. If the ivory is no longer needed to be kept for evidence, we will destroy it,” they said.
The event was witnessed by foreign diplomats and conservation groups.
“We look forward to these good intentions being bolstered with concrete actions to tackle the factors that have made Malaysia a key transit point in the global ivory trade,” said Kanitha Krishnasamy, programme manager for Traffic in south-east Asia.

Turkey declares three-month state of emergency

According to the latest teaser published by Roy Taylor, which shows the earlier unveiled Falcon Northwest Tiki SFF gaming PC, it appears that the reference dual-GPU flagship Radeon Fury X2 might have air cooling after all.Although the picture, posted by Roy Taylor on Twitter , only shows the closed system and does not reveal the rumored Radeon Fury X2 in full details, it does give us a glimpse of it through the case window and shows an air-cooled graphics card. According to a report from Videocardz.com , the graphics card in the picture is roughly the size of a reference Radeon R9 380X, which suggest that the dual-GPU Radeon Fury X2 could be the same size, mostly thanks to High Bandwidth Memory, which puts the VRAM on top of the die.As rumored earlier, the upcoming Radeon Fury X2 could be based on two Fiji GPUs with similar clocks seen earlier on the AMD Radeon R9 Nano graphics card and, by the looks of it, it could end up with a larger, and thus more powerful, blower-style fan which could be enough to keep both GPUs well cooled.Hopefully, AMD will announce the dual-GPU Fury X2 soon, or just in time for first VR headsets and we will have a chance to check out the power of two Fiji GPUs paired up on the same PCB. Unfortunately, we still do not have a precise launch date or any rumors regarding the price of such dual-GPU beast.Source: Videocardz.com
- An East Bay animal rescue organization is helping save unwanted dogs while helping veterans who struggle with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other post-war emotional difficulties.
"My first tour sticks with me the most," explained Iraq War veteran Robert Barrickman. "It's what I have the most trouble with."
Barrickman is one of about 300 vets that Tony La Russa's Animal Rescue Foundation (ARF) has matched with dogs that might have run out of time in animal shelters. Barrickman's dog is named Otto.
"Otto was the one that picked me," Barrickman said petting the dog's head.
"It was instantaneous. I think they just came up and started licking my face." Barrickman said they knew. "I knew from then we would be a good match."
The pair is one of about 300 matches ARF has made in its Pets for Vets program.
"To hear that they can sleep through the night because they have the comfort and loyalty, it's amazing," said ARF Executive Director Elena Bicker. "It improves the quality of life, not only for the veteran, but for the dog as well."
More than half of returning veterans have been diagnosed with PTSD or other mental struggles. The Veteran's Administration estimates at least 22 vets commit suicide each day. At the same time, 3,200 unwanted dogs are euthanized in America each year, according to the SPCA.
"So why not take both problems and put them together?" asked Bicker of ARF. "Save two lives at once."
KTVU followed along as ARF employees strolled through kennels at a shelter in Sacramento County, scouting for potential candidates for the Pets for Vets program.
"I don't use very typical terms sometimes," explained Lindsey as they looked at a sweet Pit Bull mix. "He's squishy. He's like, 'Ahhh, I just love having you right here!'"
Lindsey and their colleague were looking for dogs with a calm, loving demeanor...something to calm a veteran's jittery nerves.
For Barrickman, Otto has made a difference by getting them into a routine of caring for the dog and forcing them to go outside.
"I'm getting Otto registered to be my emotional support dog," Barrickman said with Otto cocooned in their lap. "That's exactly what they do for me; support me."
Looking at Otto so at ease in Barrickman's lap, the feeling seemed mutual.
"He's a joy to have," Barrickman said.

A hard-working American family have been told they have to leave Britain next month - despite building a booming business.
Jim and Vaughn Cavanagh, originally from New Jersey, moved to the UK with their two daughters in 2008 and have since invested nearly £100,000 in their shop in North Ferriby, East Yorkshire.
But the couple have fallen foul of immigration laws - which are facing a tough crackdown under the Tories - and must leave when their visas run out in August.
They employ three part-time staff at their shop The Krafting Bee, a vintage haberdasher and gift shop, and support other local independent businesses.
Mrs Cavanagh, 50, said: "We are absolutely devastated that it has come to this.
"We have had eight incredibly happy, amazing years in the UK and we really don't want to have to leave.
"Our youngest daughter was only five when we arrived and they are so English in many ways.
(Image: Caters)
"It is going to be hard for both of the girls when we go back - it's something we haven't really come to terms with yet."
The family first came to the UK when Mr Cavanagh, 54, was offered a job at consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser in Hull.
They were made redundant three years later, but daughters Michaela, 16, and 13-year-old Madeline were keen to stay in the country that had become their home.
The couple were granted entrepreneurial visas and opened The Krafting Bee - which sells handmade products from local supplies, helping to support nine other independent businesses.
The store also has a workshop that hosts regular classes in sewing and embroidery.
But last month, an immigration lawyer told the couple that despite supporting local jobs, they did not meet the right criteria to remain in the country.
poll loading Do you support an immigration cap? 3000+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO
Mrs Cavanagh said: "We have private health care, private dentistry and the girls go to a private school, so we are not a drain on anybody.
"If anything, we are providing work for people so forcing us to leave means British people will lose more money than they will save.
"With everything we have invested in the community, it is very hard for me to understand why we have to leave."
The couple hope to continue to run their business from the US for as long as possible, but accept it may eventually have to close.
(Image: BBC)
Mrs Cavanagh said: "It is very frustrating that we have to leave, just when the business was starting to thrive.
"I do understand there need to be rules but I really think you should be able to assess individuals and their contributions.
"As long as you keep working, and as long as you support and invest in your community, I think you should be allowed to stay.
"It just doesn't seem fair."
A Home Office spokesperson said the rules for the Cavanaghs' visa renewals had not changed, and the couple would have been aware of the criteria they had to meet to remain in the UK.
They said: "We have not received an extension application in relation to this case."
The war began when a fascist party and its armband-clad leader led a putsch. Antifascists mobilized in response. Threats of violence ensued.
Then the Rocky Mountain Fur Con canceled all future events.
The Fur Con is an annual summit in Denver, Colorado, for “furries,” people who present themselves as animals, from donning full-body fur suits to adopting “fursonas” for their character. And just as in the rest of America, a lot of furries resemble Nazis lately.
In Colorado, this splinter group calls itself the Furry Raiders. In 2016 the Raiders sent fur flying when they reserved a large block of Fur Con hotel rooms, sparking a fight that has lasted a year and led to death threats, allegations of tax evasion, intrigue around a suspected sovereign citizen, and the discovery of a sex offender on the Fur Con board. On Monday, Fur Con leaders chickened out of the convention altogether.
The Furry Raiders' leader, a man named Foxler who dresses in a fox suit with a Nazi-like armband (no swastika, only a paw print), told The Daily Beast the convention's cancellation all stems from a big misunderstanding.
“You could say a whole bunch of unfortunate events led to the particular issue,” they said.
Foxler claims he's not trying to evoke Hitler, never mind their name (a combination of “Fox” and their supposed surname “Miller”), their Nazi-like armband (he says is based on a character in an old video game), or pictures of them throwing their arm up in a Nazi-like salute (an accident, they said).
Foxler recently tweeted at white nationalist Richard Spencer, and posted about “aryan” dogs online, though they say their group has no political agenda.
Fascist furries are nothing new, but until recently, “they were rare individuals who were more interested in uniform fetish than espousing Nazi ideology,” Deo, another furry told The Daily Beast.
But the rise of the alt-right has ushered in the #AltFurry, a hashtag under which right-leaning furries can organize, and the uninitiated can encounter more cartoon rabbits in Nazi uniform than they possibly expected to see in their lifetimes.
So-called alt-furries are also organizing offline in groups like the Furry Raiders, which Foxler leads. Although the Furry Raiders “do not have any political agenda or stance as a group,” the group says on its website, many wear the same armband as Foxler. Foxler says he's never paid much attention to World War II history, and didn't notice the similarities.
But Foxler's claims aren't enough for many mainstream furries, who accuse them and the Furry Raiders of being far-right and using strong-arm tactics to manipulate Colorado's furry scene.
“They are an organization with a very confusing past and a very confusing history,” Zachary Brooks, chairperson of the Fur Con told The Daily Beast. “The community had taken a lot of issue regarding some symbolism that the head of the Furry Raiders had chosen to utilize for their group. It was causing a lot of controversy.”
Every year, Fur Con reserves a block of hotel rooms for convention-goers, who rent out individual rooms for the August convention. But in 2016, the Furry Raiders snatched up a large portion of the reserved rooms, in what other furries condemned as a power grab.
“When I realized what hotel it was gonna be at, I went to the hotel the next day and signed up for a corporate account,” Foxler said, adding they booked at least 30 rooms. “I had like a spare 10 extra rooms.”
Fur Con organizers and attendees were displeased.
“Despite direct communications with them, the Denver-based group known as the Furry Raiders declined to drop their reservations at the Crowne Plaza,” Brooks wrote convention attendees in a statement last April. “We have exhausted all of the means that we have to officially try to get them to release the rooms, but we're sorry to say that neither the convention nor the hotel currently have policies in place to prevent this behavior, though we strongly disapprove of it.”
“It ended up being a significant portion of rooms that prevented our other attendees from coming in and enjoying the convention,” Brooks told The Daily Beast. “It was seen by many as a malicious act by them to try to control who could and couldn't attend. So that's what really began the controversy with them.”
Outrage at the overbooking led other convention-goers to research the group holding the hotel rooms hostage, a former organizer named Newlyn said. And when furries started investigating the Furry Raiders, they said they uncovered ties between the group and leaders of the Fur Con.
“I think that particular situation was a start to the overall cause-and-effect that followed,” Newlyn told The Daily Beast of the hotel room dispute. “Announcement of investigations led to people inside and outside the Convention doing their own research, leading to the outlash of public opinion regarding [the Fur Con], and the need for change in the community.”
And in the ensuing months, the furry community did some soul-searching. While the #AltFurry hashtag grew in popularity at the tail end of 2016 and into 2017, a left-wing movement rose to meet them. The antifa furry movement coalesced around a rallying cry of “Nazi Furs Fuck Off,” and began organizing to block perceived Nazis from furry gatherings.
In January 2017, the Furry Raiders' hotel putsch was still on some anti-fascist furs' minds when a group began discussing the Furry Raiders on Twitter.
“My friend made a tweet and I responded with a joke saying ‘can't wait to punch these nazis,'” Deo said.
Deo said they had not planned on attending the Fur Con. They wrote the tweet days after President Donald Trump's inauguration, during which a protester had punched Richard Spencer in the face, inspiring a viral video and a meme about punching Nazis.
Then someone on Twitter told Deo they would enjoy watching Deo get shot at the convention.
Deo reached out to Fur Con organizers to warn them of the gun threat. The Marriott hotel where the convention was scheduled to take place also learned of the threat. The hotel consulted with Denver Police who deemed the exchange a credible threat. The Marriott asked Fur Con organizers to provide a security force, which would have cost over $20,000, about a third of the convention's operating budget, according to Brooks. But Deo said the convention organizers were slower to respond.
“I emailed RMFC [Rocky Mountain Fur Con] security to warn them of the threat,” Deo said. “RMFC never responded to my email.”
Instead, Deo received a strange letter in the mail late last month. Snail mail is a big deal for furries, many of whom choose not to reveal their real names, let alone their home addresses. And the notice—purportedly a cease and desist order—that found its way to Deo's home was full of threatening pseudo-legal jargon. It was signed by Kendal Emery, the Fur Con founder who still sat on the convention's board.
Introducing themselves as a member of the Fur Con board, Emery claimed to be “in possession of what appears as False statements issued by you and your other potentially damaging criminal activities causing substantial commercial injury damages against us and ours and possible other plaintiffs including but not limited to Furry Raiders… and many other yet to be discovered and named in a possible class action lawsuit as we continue to investigate these potential crimes.”
Emery also blamed Deo for the gun threat they received, and accused them of incitement to riot and “criminal activities such as creating an entire meme… that we are something we are not which may rise to the level of felonious activities.”
Finally, the letter banned Deo from Fur Con.
At the bottom was Emery's red fingerprint, a symbol sometimes used by members of the sovereign citizen movement, who believe themselves independent of the U.S. legal system. “My first thought was it was a fake letter, sent by someone trying to threaten me,” Deo said. “But I looked into it and the letter sent on behalf of RMFC by Kendal Emery was real. So I talked to a few lawyers, who explained how the letter was crazy bullshit. I hired one to write a response letter anyway, even if there was no need to reply to this sovereign citizen mess.”
They also tweeted a copy of the letter. Furries were quick to point out its irregularities. The letter banned Deo from ever attended the Fur Con, a significant move from Emery, who had previously boasted of never banning conference attendees, according to Dogpatch Press, a furry news site. Furries began sifting through old stories of Emery's past and speculating whether they were a sovereign citizen.
In an interview with The Daily Beast, Emery denied being a sovereign citizen.
“I am a citizen of the United States,” Emery said. The red fingerprint at the bottom of their self-issued legal letter, “just means it's me that wrote it.”
Brooks said Emery had written the letter, but that it had Fur Con's blessing.
“The letter was initiated by him,” Brooks told The Daily Beast. “The board was aware of it, but they made the final decision to send it.”
Emery's account was slightly different. “That was the opinion of the whole [Fur Con] board,” they said of the decision to ban Deo and send them the wild legal threat.
The letter's ambiguous origin led some furries to speculate that the Fur Con was over-friendly with the Furry Raiders, whom the letter named as possible plaintiffs in a class-action suit over Deo's tweets.
Deo offered up what they said is evidence of Emery's association with the Furry Raiders, a video showing Emery and Foxler play-fighting at the 2016 convention. Emery told The Daily Beast that they and Foxler were friends, but said that friendship did “absolutely not” contribute to their decision to ban Deo.
Alarmed by the letter, furries demanded greater accountability from the conference, demanding the Fur Con disavow fascists in their ranks.
But when they dug into the convention and its leaders, they found other problems.
Until recently, the Fur Con claimed to be run by a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, but furry news site Flayrah found that the convention's parent company had its nonprofit status revoked in 2011 by the IRS for “failure to file a Form 990-series return or notice for three consecutive years.” (Brooks told The Daily Beast that, while they had lost their federal tax-exempt status, they were still registered as a state nonprofit in Colorado.)
Then the furries learned Emery was a registered sex offender for their 1993 conviction for sexual contact with a minor. Emery's past had been something of an open secret since 2008, when furry forums got wind of their criminal history and they stepped down as head of the convention in 2008.
“They decided to drag up my past, which has nothing to do with this,” Emery told The Daily Beast, chalking the furries' motivation up to “when you are losing an argument, you do your best to discredit your foe in any way you can.”
On Monday, it was announced Fur Con was canceled—possibly for good.
“Last month, we were faced with a sudden and drastic increase in security costs amounting to more than a third of our entire existing operating budget,” Brooks wrote in a statement. “This cost increase stemmed directly from the very public threats of violence against one another by members of this community, as well as the negative backlash from misinformation spread about the convention, its staff and attendees. Therefore, Rocky Mountain Fur Con 2017 is officially canceled. I will no longer continue to subject my staff and our community to the lies, hate, violence and slander that was disseminated by a small, vocal minority.”
If the statement was vague about who it considered to be the “vocal minority” spreading “lies, hate, violence and slander,” Emery was not. They told The Daily Beast that Deo's joke about punching a Nazi, and not the threat of a gun led police to declare Fur Con a security risk.
“First of all, the person who [made the gun threat] wasn't a Furry Raider, and second of all, if it was, all they said was it would be funny if somebody did bring a gun shot you,” Emery said, adding that, “I don't think that would be funny, I think that would be tragic.”
“All the stories about ‘oh, we closed because I'm a sex offender,' ‘we closed because of tax evasion,' no,” Emery said. “We closed because of the violence.”
Former attendees said the closure came as a disappointment. “I've gone to this con in the past and sincerely enjoyed myself,” one person wrote on the Fur Con's Facebook page after the cancellation. “I'm sorry to see it crash and burn due to utterly incompetent leadership.”
“I am saddened by the shutdown,” Newlyn, the former volunteer, said. “It has affected a large number of people not only here in Colorado but around the world, some of whom could only attend RMFC each year due to real-life responsibilities. I have eight years of great memories from this Convention, and I'll cherish them forever.”
Even though they hadn't planned on attending the convention, Deo said the experience has been rattling.
“I'm upset they threatened me, called me a criminal, made up lies, impersonated an attorney, and are trying to make the villain for speaking publicly about the letter they should never have sent,” they said.
Brooks said they have no plans to start a new convention, and Emery said they “will not be involved in another convention ever.”
For now, the Colorado furry community's alt-right and anti-fascists will have to hash out their differences outside the convention hall.
“The main issue that led to the shutdown was the conflict between the Furry Raiders and the antifa furs,” Brooks said. “It was not what we wanted to do.”
Foxler said they don't understand how the situation got so out of hand.
“I'm really furry,” they said. “I don't see human problems.”
This article is about the 1982 film. For the TV series on climate change, see Years of Living Dangerously
The Year of Living Dangerously is a 1982 Australian romantic drama film directed by Peter Weir and co-written by Weir and David Williamson adapted from Christopher Koch's 1978 novel The Year of Living Dangerously. The story is about a love affair set in Indonesia during the overthrow of President Sukarno. It follows a group of foreign correspondents in Jakarta on the eve of an attempted coup by the 30 September Movement in 1965.
The film stars Mel Gibson as Australian journalist Guy Hamilton, and Sigourney Weaver as British Embassy officer Jill Bryant. It also stars Linda Hunt as the male dwarf Billy Kwan, Hamilton's local photographer contact, a role for which Hunt won the 1983 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.[6] The film was shot in both Australia and the Philippines and includes Australian actors Bill Kerr as Colonel Henderson and Noel Ferrier as Wally O'Sullivan.
It was banned from being shown in Indonesia until 1999, after the forced resignation of coup-leader and political successor Suharto in 1998.[7] The title The Year of Living Dangerously is a quote which refers to a famous Italian phrase used by Sukarno; vivere pericolosamente, meaning "living dangerously". Sukarno used the line for the title of their Indonesian Independence Day speech of 1964.
Plot [ edit ]
Guy Hamilton, a neophyte foreign correspondent for an Australian network, arrives in Jakarta on assignment. They meet the close-knit members of the foreign correspondent community including journalists from the United Kingdom, the United States, and New Zealand, diplomatic personnel--and Billy Kwan, a Chinese-Australian dwarf of high intelligence and moral seriousness. Hamilton is initially unsuccessful because their predecessor, tired of life in Indonesia, had departed without introducing Hamilton to their contacts. They receive limited sympathy from the journalist community, which competes for scraps of information from Sukarno's government, the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), and the conservative Muslim Indonesian military. However, Billy takes a liking to Guy and arranges interviews for them with key political figures.
Billy introduces Guy to Jill Bryant, a beautiful young assistant at the British embassy. Billy and Jill are close friends, yet Billy subtly manipulates their encounters with Guy. After resisting Guy because she's returning to the United Kingdom, Jill falls in love with him. Discovering that the Communist Chinese are arming the PKI, Jill passes this information to Guy to save their lives, but they want to cover the Communist rebellion that will occur when the arms shipment reaches Jakarta. Shocked, Billy and Jill end their friendships with Guy, and they are left with the American journalist, Pete Curtis, and their own assistant and driver Kumar, who is secretly a member of the PKI. Kumar, however, remains loyal to Guy, and tries to open their eyes to all that is going on.
Billy, outraged by Sukarno's failure to meet the needs of most Indonesians, decides to hang a sign saying "Sukarno feed your people" from the Hotel Indonesia expressing their outrage, but is thrown from the window by security men, and dies in Guy's arms. Their death is also witnessed by Jill. Still in search of "the big story", Guy visits the Presidential palace after the army generals have taken over and unleashed executions, after they learned of the Communist shipment. Struck down by an Army officer, Guy suffers a detached retina.
Resting alone in Billy's bungalow, Hamilton recalls a passage from the Bhagavad Gita, "all is clouded by desire", which Billy told him. Kumar visits them and tells them about the failed coup attempt. Risking permanent damage to their eye, a heavily bandaged Guy implores Kumar to drive them to the airport, where they board the last plane out of Jakarta and is reunited with Jill.
Cast [ edit ]
Production [ edit ]
Development [ edit ]
A number of filmmakers were interested in buying the rights to Christopher Koch's novel including Phillip Noyce. It was Peter Weir who was successful. Koch wrote an early draft but Weir was unhappy with it. Alan Sharp wrote three more drafts, then David Williamson was brought on to do several more drafts. Koch later came back on to work on some of the voice over, although they never spoke with Peter Weir. Koch later claimed that the final script was "55% Williamson/Weir, and 45% Koch".[8]
The film was originally backed by the South Australian Film Corporation and the Australian Film Commission, with international distribution arranged by MGM/UA Entertainment Company. However, the SAFC then dropped out and Weir's agent suggested MGM provides the entire $6 million budget themselves, which is what happened.[2][9] It was by far the most ambitious Australian film undertaken at the time and was one of the first co-productions between Australia and a Hollywood studio.
Casting [ edit ]
Linda Hunt as Billy Kwan
Dancer David Atkins was originally cast as Billy Kwan. However, during rehearsals Weir began to feel that the relationship between their character and Mel Gibson's was not working so they decided to recast. Several actors auditioned, including Bob Balaban and Wallace Shawn, when Weir saw a photo of Linda Hunt. They asked for them to audition and decided to cast her.[2] To accomplish the role during production, Hunt shortened "her hair and dye[d] it black[,] wore padding around their waist, shaved their eyebrows, and carried something in their shirt pocket."[10] In their 1986 interview with Bomb magazine, Hunt remarked that Billy Kwan "is supra-personal [with] layers of sexual ambiguity[.]"[11]
Filming [ edit ]
Although originally set to be filmed in Jakarta, permission to film in Indonesia was denied, so the bulk of the film was shot in the Philippines. Death threats against Weir and Gibson from Muslims who believed the film would be anti-Islam forced the production to move to Australia. Gibson downplayed the death threats, saying, "It wasn't really that bad. We got a lot of death threats to be sure, but I just assumed that when there are so many, it must mean nothing is really going to happen. I mean, if they meant to kill us, why send a note?"[12][13]
Gibson described their character Guy, saying, "He's not a silver-tongued devil. He's kind of immature and they have some rough edges and I guess you could say the same for me."[14]
Music [ edit ]
"L'Enfant", a track from Vangelis' 1979 album Opera sauvage, was featured in the film.
Release [ edit ]
The Year of Living Dangerously was entered into the 1983 Cannes Film Festival[15] where it was well received by audiences and critics.[16]
Box office [ edit ]
The film opened in Australia on 17 December 1982. Filmed on a budget of $6 million,[3] The Year of Living Dangerously grossed $2,898,000 at the box office in Australia.[4]
The film opened in the United States via limited release on 21 January 1983 before receiving a wide release on 18 February 1983. In its limited release opening weekend, the film earned $35,000 at the domestic box office.[17] When released nationwide, the film ranked twelfth in the box office with $1,716,040.[18] At the end of its run, the film grossed $10,278,575 in the United States.[5]
Critical reception [ edit ]
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 90% rating based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site's consensus states: "Both a smart, suspenseful tale of intrigue and a sweeping romance, The Year of Living Dangerously features excellent performances from Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver as a pair of journalists covering political unrest in Indonesia."[19] Metacritic reports a 65 out of 100 rating based on 9 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[20] Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars and praised Hunt's performance: "Billy Kwan is played, astonishingly, by a woman—Linda Hunt, a New York stage actor who enters the role so fully that it never occurs to us that they are not a man. This is what great acting is, a magical transformation of one person into another".[21] In their review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby praised Gibson's performance: "If this film doesn't make an international star of Mr. Gibson (Gallipoli, The Road Warrior), then nothing will. They possess both the necessary talent and the screen presence".[22]
However, Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, "But in their attempt to blend their preoccupations with the plot of C. J. Koch's 1978 novel, Weir has perhaps packed too much imagery and information into their movie ... The plot becomes landlocked in true-life implausibilities; the characters rarely get a hold on the moviegoer's heart or lapels".[23] In their review for the Washington Post, Gary Arnold described the film as "a grievously flawed yet compelling tale of political intrigue, certainly a triumph of atmosphere if not of coherent dramatization".[24] Newsweek magazine called the film "an annoying failure because it fritters away so many rich opportunities".[25]
For their work in the film, Weir was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival and Hunt won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress[3] becoming the first person to win an Oscar for playing a character of the opposite sex.[26]

RENTS AROUND IRELAND continue to rise inexorably despite the two-year cap placed on rental increases by landlords last December.
New figures from the Private and Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) show that, while the rate of private sector rents slowed somewhat in the final three months of 2015, an overall growth factor of 2.2% was seen around the country last year.
The figures are worrying given the difficulty for tenants in finding an affordable place to live at present, particularly in the capital.
The rental market in general across the country appears to be spiralling towards crisis, with the issue being encapsulated by a story revealed over the weekend by the Sunday Business Post concerning as many as 100 residents in Tyrrelstown, west Dublin, being about to lose their homes after their rental properties were bought out by so-called ‘vulture' funds.
The figures
Over the last quarter of 2015 rents grew at a slightly faster rate in the country outside Dublin:
The national average rent for the final quarter of 2015 was €921
In Dublin, the monthly rent for a house has increased by €124 for a house and €105 for an apartment, to €1,431 and €1,314 respectively
Nationally rents increased by 2.2% over the last three months of last year
Rents in Dublin increased by 1.8% (houses – 0.7%, apartments 1.9%)
Prices being charged across the country were 9.8% higher than at the same point in 2014 (the figure for the Dublin market is 9%)
Worryingly, rents in Dublin are now 0.4% higher than at their 2007 pre-crash peak, while for the rest of the country prices being charged are now 14.5% off their 2007 high
All the figures mentioned can be viewed on the PRTB's quarterly rent index here.
Rental cap?
A spokesperson for the PRTB says the figures stand as “another opportunity” to remind both landlords and tenants of the provisions of the new tenancy legislation which came into law last December.
“That provides that rent may only be increased once in a 24-month period, previously 12 months,” they said.
It also provides that 90-days advance notice must be given prior to any increase, previously 28 days. As previously, rents may not be more than the market rate.
In the event of a dispute, landlords and tenants can take a case to the PRTB which provides free mediation services (previously there was a fee for the application for any such services).
This provision was introduced alongside the rent stability measures in December.
With Algerian authorities still combing through the aftermath of last week's hostage siege at the Amenas gas plant, which led to the deaths of scores of foreign hostages, a surprising fact about the hostage takers' armaments has been revealed.
According to officials, the arms came from Libya. And by and large not the looted arsenal of the former Gadhafi regime, whose armaments have left the entire region awash in weapons, but rather the modern gear provided by GCC member nations to the Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) and associated rebel groups, who have since been installed by NATO as the government of Libya.
The attackers fought their way onto the heavily guarded site wielding the same AK104 weapons that were the gun of choice for the Libyan rebels, and even wearing the yellow flak jackets provided to the NTC by the Qatari government.
The Libyan Civil War and the subsequent free-for-all of arms looting has driven many conflicts in the region, and the rebels in Mali are by and large armed with looted Gadhafi regime weapons. This is the first time weapons provided to the NTC have turned up in a foreign conflict however.

Southern Charm star Kathryn Dennis has obviously had the worst possible year ever, with their break up with co-star Thomas Ravenel, and their failed drug test that took place one year ago, but what has made it worse is all of the rumors that since they returned from rehab in Malibu just before Labor Day that insist they have failed drug tests. Up until now Kathryn took their tests each week, and every month, and passed, and results were sent to the court, and those involved in the case had access. They have gone as far as to also purchase a breathalyzer to prove that they have also been avoiding alcohol.
But Kathryn has had to learn a tough lesson, which is that there are some people out there who will make things up, whether it's to be hurtful, or just for attention (or maybe because they were not asked to return to Southern Charm this season). Either way, Kathryn has spent months turning the other cheek, and not responding on advice of counsel.

“Making sure that my tests are absolutely clean each month is the most important thing I have ever done,” Kathryn says. “That is the only way I can get shared custody of Kensie and Saint, and that is what I am doing.”
But today, Kathryn's lawyers gave their permission to release all of their tests, hair and urine, from when they returned from rehab until now, exclusively to Reality Tea. The details in the forms are highly personal, and include details like their social security number, their address, and their private medical files, which are truly nobody's business.
People are going to believe what they are going to believe, but I now have access to all of Kathryn's tests (verified by a third party) and they have passed all of them, urine and hair. On the urine tests, someone was in the room with them each time they gave a sample, and for their hair, the hairs were pulled from their head by an official.
And the tests are incredibly detailed, and cover three pages worth of drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, opiates, PCP, LSD, and more. While different substances are metabolized in urine faster, usually within a month, most of these drugs can be found in hair for many months. Kathryn's hair and urine tests were clear of all pharmaceuticals with the exception of those prescription drugs they take for an unrelated medical condition, that their doctor and the court says have nothing to do with illicit substances.

Each month when Kathryn does a hair test, and each week when they do a urine tests, the results are sent directly to the lawyers, and to the court, and each time, Kathryn has passed. They have also agreed to continue to share the results, and they vow they will continue to pass.
“Hearing the rumors, that I was seen here or there, that I was high, or in the company of drug dealers, it's all ridiculous and it's all lies.”
Kathryn says that after they returned from rehab, they cut off all ties with anyone who could, might even seem suspect. But seeing as Kathryn and their legal team can prove that they have passed each and every drug test since they returned from rehab, those who have accused them of using in print might have some problems of a legal variety.
It is no secret that Kathryn and Jennifer Snowden no longer are friends, and just last month, Jennifer put out a statement, pretty much accusing Kathryn of continuing to use drugs. As a result of a Reality Tea article last month, Jennifer Snowden responded, saying that Kathryn was still using illegal drugs. “KD you seriously need 2 lay off the drugs. How much were you paid to make this up? Desperate sicko.”
(Editor's note: Kathryn isn't being paid)
TELL US – SHOULD KATHRYN HAVE TO KEEP PROVING TO THE WORLD THAT They Have PASSED Them DRUG TESTS EACH MONTH, DESPITE Them ALLEGED FORMER FRIENDS SELLING Them OUT WITH RUMORS?

Lake Superior is the northernmost of the five Great Lakes. The largest freshwater lake in the world by area, it seems more like an ocean or an inland sea, measuring 350 miles wide and 160 miles long. In its northwest corner lies Isle Royale, the largest island in Lake Superior. It is part of Michigan, 55 miles away, but even closer to Minnesota and just off the coast of Ontario, Canada. Its remote location and winter park closure makes it the least visited national park in the lower 48 states. Isle Royale's total 2016 visitation of 24,966 people is less than the number of visitors that Yellowstone may get in a day. And only three Alaskan parks (Lake Clark, Kobuk Valley, and Gates of the Arctic) received fewer visitors last year than Isle Royale.
The 571,000 acre park includes Isle Royale and 400 smaller islands and is designated as 99% wilderness. There are just two developed areas on the 45 mile long and 9 mile wide islands itself: Windigo on the southwest end and Rock Harbor on its northeast side. The remainder of Isle Royale is comprised of numerous ridges and 165 miles of hiking trails along its coastline, forest, bogs and lakes.
There are only two ways to get to the island, either by seaplane or ferry. The closest ferry crossing is from Grand Portage, Minnesota, so we booked the 22 mile boat passage from there to Windigo. The ferry left at 7:30 am, meaning that we were up early in rainy weather to make our final backpacking preparations before boarding the Voyageur III. Along with us were travelers staying at the one hotel in Rock Harbor or at some of the cabins in Windigo, as well as a 20-person Boy Scout troop backpacking an island loop for several days.
Two hours later the ferry docked at Windigo. After the boat's 40 passengers received a ranger orientation on the dock, most of them disembarked to either camp, backpack, or stay in the cabins. We and a few other people walked to the visitor center to pick up our backpacking permits.
We listed our planned itinerary with the ranger, and armed with our paperwork, we re-boarded the ferry. Upon request hikers can continue past Windigo to more remote island drop-off points. As the Voyageur III traveled along the northern shoreline, the rain subsided, giving us clearer views of the island.
After three hours, the ferry entered into an inlet and arrived at McCargoe Cove, located about 2/3 of the way down the island, or about 36 miles by water from Windigo. Ten people, including us, left the boat there. As soon as the backpacks were unloaded, the Voyageur III resumed its journey, having two more hours to travel before arriving in Rock Harbor for the night.
When we disembarked on to the dock, a NPS volunteer was present to answer any questions. I asked them about the trail conditions as the boat left. Unfortunately, I didn't notice that I was missing a water bottle from my pack's side pocket until the ferry was gone. We still had several others, but I was frustrated that I didn't check my pack more carefully when we first disembarked.
We had four days before our reserved ferry left Windigo for Minnesota, and we planned to backpack primarily on the Greenstone Ridge Trail. The longest trail in the park, Greenstone Ridge runs 40 miles along the island's highest ridges from one end to the other. It passes several points with views of the island and Lake Superior, including the highest point on Isle Royale at 1,394 feet. We didn't have time to complete the entire trail, but planned to cover about 25 miles of its total distance.
Along the island's trails are designated campgrounds, with pit toilets, spaced out at about three to ten mile intervals. The sites at each campground are first-come, first-serve, but since we were there before the most popular months of July and August, we generally had our choice of campsites.
When receiving our permit we specified that we would spend our first night at McCargoe Cove, but after sitting so long on the ferry, we decided to hike 2.7 miles to the next campground on the west side of Chickenbone Lake. It was sunny and humid as we walked. We followed the narrow Indian Portage Trail out of McCargoe Cove, and soon we were walking along the edge of Chickenbone Lake.
Right way we found the trail to be muddy in places, making our hiking slow going. The mud also attracted groups of mosquitoes that hovered around us. We had decided to spray our hiking clothes, gaiters, and hats with permethrin before we left and were glad that we did, as we noticed a difference in the number of mosquitoes that actually landed on our clothes. Several spots on the trail had boardwalks installed, keeping us out of the mud.
As we walked along the edge of the lake we saw several frogs.
After a little over an hour of hiking we reached the campground at Chickenbone Lake. We found a site with two different tent pads and set things up on the location with the best view of the lake. As we were unpacking, Darren realized that they had forgotten our stove. Since it had been raining when we got up early in the morning, we had not bothered to thoroughly double-check our packing.
We did have fuel, because I carried an extra canister. So we reasoned that if we could just borrow a stove from another camper, we could use our own fuel to boil water for our dehydrated dinners, making it less of a pain for them. Rather than have to borrow a stove for both dinner and breakfast, we also made the decision to make ice coffee each night before going to bed and reallocate some bars to eat for breakfast, rather than the oatmeal we had planned for a couple of meals. With this approach, we had little trouble borrowing a stove each afternoon, and actually were able to meet more people along the way.
As if losing the water bottle and forgetting the stove were not bad enough, we had another issue on our first day. While eating dinner, we saw two turtles walk by us. One of them went into the bushes, but the other kept pacing back and forth right outside of our tent. At one point they tried to crawl underneath it. We thought we had been diligent in checking the tent pad for any sign of animal holes, and had seen none. So we didn't understand why the turtle wanted to be there.
We shooed the turtle away and thought we had seen the last of it. A little later we got ready for bed and went inside the tent. As I was sitting inside reading, I heard a noise and was startled to discover that the turtle had actually gotten underneath the tent right next to my sleeping bag. There was no telling if it would be back again, so we got up and moved our tent about 20 feet away to the other pad as dusk fell. We didn't see the turtle after that.
After a good night's sleep, we got an early start. The forecast called for rain, and my research told me that the day's stage was regarded to be the most difficult of the entire trail. After a short steep climb, we joined the Greenstone Ridge Trail and turned west towards Hatchet Lake.
We hadn't walked but a short distance when we heard a crashing sound to the left of the trail in the forest. There was a moose moving among the trees, but it ran away after hearing Darren open their camera pouch. Nevertheless, we hoped that seeing it was a harbinger of some better sightings to come.
The path alternated between dense forest and steep ascents to rocky plateaus. As we hiked inland from the shoreline, we also noticed the trees changing from a boreal forest of spruce and fir to more maple and oaks, which prefer warmer temperatures.
At the first of those plateaus, we began to see views of the island.
After about an hour of hiking, the rain began to fall, becoming hard at times. We kept hiking, but stopped at one point in a forest of birch trees to wait for the pouring rain to taper off. As we stood under a canopy of trees, we ran into two guys who were hiking in the opposite direction. We traded trail stories, and they took a picture of us.
The rain soon became lighter and we set off again, passing by some stunning flowers along the trail.
The trail became bushy and dense with ferns as we walked through another forest section.
After 7.9 miles we arrived at Hatchet Lake, in what we termed as a moderate day of hiking. Typical of all the places we camped on Isle Royale, the beginning of the campground displayed a map of the group and individual campsites, as well as the location of the outhouses. At Hatchet Lake we camped at individual site #2, with a partial view of the lake. Campsites also tended to have nice logs, making it a little more comfortable to sit while eating.
On day three of our backpacking trip, the rain had stopped, but it was a cold overcast day. Almost immediately the trail climbed to a plateau with another great vista of the island and Lake Superior. We had to keep reminding ourselves that we were looking a lake and not an ocean around us.
We also saw several more beautiful flowers, a butterfly, and mossy forest along the way.
In the early afternoon, we had our first view of Lake Desor. We camped on its south side after hiking 8.1 miles.
Our campsite was a large area with a group of logs to sit on and a view of the lake. A steep path took us down to the water where we saw loons swimming by us.
It was raining when we woke up the next morning, and we took our time packing up in the hope that it might stop before we began hiking. At about 9:00 am the rain ceased. We quickly broke camp and got back on the trail. Because of all the rain, the trail was extremely muddy. My shoes became slick and it was difficult to walk without slipping. The path was also bushy in several areas, sometimes coming up to my shoulders.
The trail was not as steep, meaning that there were few viewpoints, but the lack of vistas were made up by the stunning forest scenery that we encountered as we hiked.
We made good time on the flatter trail, so decided to combine the final two stages into one to complete 11.3 miles and arrive at Windigo a day early. As we ended our time on the Greenstone Ridge Trail, the path steeply climbed down off the ridge to a sign announcing that we had arrived back at Windigo.
The large campground at Washington Creek had a waterfront site open, so we set up camp there. While I put up the tent, Darren walked a short distance to the Windigo store and came back with a bottle of wine for us to celebrate the completion of our 30.3 mile backpacking trip. Washington Creek turned out to be our favorite campsite, with a unobstructed view of the water and a picnic table to relax on as we enjoyed our wine and last dehydrated dinner.
With no hiking to do the next day before our ferry left at 2:00 pm, we woke up and had a leisurely breakfast. As we ate, we reminisced about our time on the trail and all the beauty we had seen. After that first moose sighting early on our second day of hiking, we had not seen another one, and were a little disappointed to be leaving without a clearer view.
As we talked, we saw a canoe go by with two people in it who had been on our ferry and were staying at the Windigo cabins. A short time later we heard another noise from the creek, and figured it was the canoe coming back the other way. We were stunned to see a female moose just a few feet away from us along the creek bank. We watched silently as they slowly waded across the creek. It was a magical experience for us.
Now fully satisfied, we broke camp and walked back to the visitor center to turn in our permit and attend a couple of ranger talks designed for the day trippers who had arrived earlier in the day for four hours on the island. We found the talks to be a great complement to what we had just seen over the four previous days.
One talk gave us some insight into the island's history prior to becoming a national park in 1940. We learned that the Native American Ojibwe people populated the area up to 4,500 years ago. The United States took possession of the island from the French in 1783. Subsequently, copper mining and fishing took place on and around the island. By the early 1900s wealthy families from Chicago and St. Louis vacationed in the area during the summer months.
Another talk told us about the moose and wolves on the island. Both animals arrived on Isle Royale during the last hundred years, with the moose appearing between 1905 and 1912, and the wolves inhabiting the island in the 1950s. One theory for their population movement is that a land bridge would form between the island and mainland in the winter months. Today, temperatures are too warm to create the link to the mainland, making the ecosystem a closed environment. In fact, it is the only known place where moose and wolves coexist without the presence of bears. Isle Royale's unique ecosystem also made it an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980.
The predator-prey relationship between the moose and wolf populations has been studied over the past 50 years by scientists. Every year researchers spend several weeks counting the animals by air. The numbers of both the moose and wolf have fluctuated during recent years. For example, in the 2006-2007 winter, about 385 moose and 21 wolves were counted; in the spring of 2008, approximately 650 moose and 23 wolves were tallied. The most recent count stands at about 1,600 moose and only 2 wolves, due to inbreeding issues. The park service is currently debating whether to introduce more wolves into the Isle Royale environment.
After the last talk ended, we boarded the Sea Hunter III ferry with the day trippers, our canoe friends, and the same Boy Scout troop to begin our journey back to civilization. As we pulled away from the dock, the sun came out as the rangers waved goodbye to us.
Even though we had a series of unfortunate events with our missing water bottle, forgotten stove, and turtle “encounter” on our first day, we so loved our time on majestic Isle Royale. Seeing the forest, flowers, vistas, and wildlife while backpacking was an incredible experience for us on our national park journey. As the ferry traveled back in the wide open inland sea of Lake Superior, we talked of returning to venture to Rock Harbor and perhaps hike some of the island's other trails.
We will be going into the backcountry again at our next stop, Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota, as we explore the area by foot and canoe.
Algorithmic trading is not a novel idea. In fact it seems to be quite a researched topic, and it's not difficult to find resources about it online. From strategies, to code libraries, to people sharing algorithms on github.
In or case, we wanted to use it to invest on bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. To invest you need an exchange: a place that you let you buy and sell bitcoin in exchange for "real money" (eg, dollars or euros). In the last years several of them have surged and become established, most notably perhaps Coinbase and Kraken.
And the best news - these exchanges offer a public API, that you can use in your algorithms for automatic trading. Sweet!
Simulate first
Playing with the exchanges themselves however would require investing real money. Also, they charge a rate for every transaction, so before recklessly toying around we should first find a decent algorithm while testing on a simulated environment.
And so, we set ourselves to the task. We made a little python script that would simulate the interface with the stock exchange to buy or sell. You can feed a CSV file to the script with the historical exchange rate, so that it can replay it.
You just need to search google to quickly find some historical data for stocks. For bitcoin data a good source is the Bitcoincharts API.
The algorithms
On top of that toy environment we set to build a couple algorithms, and set them to compete against each other:
simple algorithm: keeps a constant amount invested in stock at all time. If the price goes up, it extracts the profit difference with the original amount. If the price goes down, it buys up new stock until it reaches the investment amount.
pirate algorithm: based on this algorithm that we found on github. It keeps track of the value at which you bought or sold a bit of stock. If the price goes further down that you bought it for, it will sell it to avoid loss. If it goes up it will rebuy it.
static algorithm: buys full amount of funds and simply waits. No fuss investment! It will basically produce profit or loss depending on the longterm evolution of the market.
random algorithm: it will randomly buy or sell a fixed amount.
These are not very sophisticated strategies, but they are a starting point. Now the next step would be to simulate them running against the historical exchange rate data for bitcoin, and see if they had made us any money had we set the algorithm to run some time ago in the past.
Results
We simulated the run of these algorithms over the last year of bitcoin historical data, over an investment amount of $1000. The resulting benefit in USD was a follow:
static simple pirate random (3-run average) 252.244923 486.14863 -999.957644 1204670.35464
Interestingly, it seems that the best strategy is by a huge margin the random one! Our simple algorithm turned to be a slight improvement over the static "invest and forget" strategy, yielding double the amount of benefits. The pirate algorithm turned out a huge disappointment and made us loss practically all of our investment amount. The surprising results come from the random algorithm, which yielded a x1000 ROI.
Is our conclussion then that the best investment strategy for the stock market is to buy and sell randomly? Well, let's not go that fast. Consider that the shape of the exchange rate curve might have much to explain.
Notice how bitcoin has had an exponential growth during the last year. Under this sort of conditions, no matter what you do, the market is going to be on your favor. Under this kind of curve, constant mindless selling and buying is of course what is going to make you right, rather than being more conservative with your money.
Lets see what's the difference when running the same set of algorithms over just the last month of June, in which there was a strong volatility but not a noticeable diff in the exchange rate.
static simple pirate random (3-run average) -41.3003 -31.1976 -81.3840 -18.3573
There was indeed a small loss in the value of bitcoin, which is reflected by the static strategy. Our simple algorithm was not a huge improvement here, it managed to mitigate the loss a little bit but not in a significant way. The pirate algorithm proves to be just as terrible, while the random one now shows its limitations.
Conclusions
Algorithmic trading is easy to implement, but difficult to come up with a strategy that will make you rich. If there existed a way, be sure that the best data scientists in the world would have already found it, and everyone would be using it. Predicting when is the best time to sell and buy is difficult even for expert human stock traders after all!
Even with one strategy, there's lots of fine tunning to do in terms of amounts, timings and optimizations that we didn't try in our experiments. Also not all stock shapes look the same, and different algorithms might perform differently depending on the characteristics of the stock type. For example, some stocks might exhibit more volatility, others are more stable, some have a higher price than others and might perform better if you algorithm is willing to invest bigger rather than smaller amount.
Even having this into account, what is for sure going to make you money is picking a market that goes up rather than down! It is unlikely that an algorithm can create a profit when prices are going down. At most, it can try to mitigate the losses, but picking a winning stock is the only way to generating benefits.
And last but not least: in our setup we didn't consider the particularities of the exchange services, namely, the fees. An exchange service will charge fees normally per transaction, so having this into account is fundamental when designing your algorithm, or you might loose any earnings simply paying for fees. The fees are different with every exchange service, but normally they are expensive for small quantities and after a level they even out. Exchanges that are friendlier and more accessible for beginners (for instance coinbase) are also more expensive than others.
You can find our algorithms and the sandbox code in our github.

(CQ Roll Call via AP Images) Senators Mark Warner and Elizabeth Warren talk before the start of a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing in February.
Despite Republican leaders' best attempts to convince Senate Democrats from red states like Indiana, West Virginia, and North Dakota to vote for repealing the Affordable Care Act, cutting entitlements, and enacting sweeping tax cuts for the rich, congressional Democrats have remained united. That unanimity—along with a heaping dose of presidential ineptitude—has left the GOP's legislative agenda largely unaccomplished 11 months into the Donald Trump administration.
Alas, the congressional Democrats' spine couldn't stay stiff forever. So what's the straw that broke the party's back?
Wall Street, of course.
On Monday, news broke that Senate Banking Committee Chair Mike Crapo had struck a deal with a cadre of Wall Street friendly Senate Democrats to roll back regulations, including key parts of Dodd-Frank, on a large segment of the banking industry under the guise of providing new consumer protections and relief for struggling community banks.
The bloc of Democrats went around their own Democratic ranking committee member, Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, who walked away from talks with Crapo weeks ago after they said it became clear that any sort of bipartisan deal would be dramatically skewed toward banks, not consumers.
Eight Senate Democrats and independent Maine Senator Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats, have signed on to the deal with Crapo. They include four members of the banking committee—John Tester from Montana, Joe Donnelly from Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp from North Dakota, and Mark Warner from Virginia—as well as former Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine of Virginia, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, and Gary Peters of Michigan.
The bill would make it easier for “smaller” banks to sell high-risk mortgages, remove reporting requirements and certain capital standards, and free them of the Volcker rule that creates a wall between a bank's investment activities and regular depositor banking. The biggest change, though, is that it would substantially lift the threshold for what is considered under Dodd-Frank to be a “systemically important financial institution,” from $50 billion to $250 billion. This would release dozens of financial behemoths, including American Express, SunTrust, and BB&T, from additional Federal Reserve monitoring and more substantial capital requirements. As critics of the legislation warn, the bill would thereby allow a larger swath of the banking industry to engage in the type of risky behavior that led to the economic disaster of the late 2000s.
As David Dayen reports for The Intercept, the bill also includes giveaways for hedge funds and big banks investing in the bond markets, while only instituting modest consumer protections, such as a provision requiring credit bureaus to provide a free credit freeze and unfreeze each year, which is a weak-tea version of a bill introduced by Senator Elizabeth Warren.
The support of these nine Democrats give Republicans enough votes to avoid a filibuster and pass the bill through the Senate, setting up a potential conference committee to iron out the differences with a far more drastic financial deregulatory bill passed by the House over the summer—the Financial CHOICE Act. In short, Democrats could deliver a major win to Trump and their Wall Street buddies, with a bipartisan veneer, no less.
Up until now, the two ends of the party spectrum have stayed united in opposition to Trump's agenda of health care repeal and tax cuts. But if Democrats are in disarray about anything, it's Wall Street. The defection is sure to heighten tensions between the party's progressive wing, embodied by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and its centrists.
“It's incredibly discouraging to see a bunch of Democrats join hands with Wall Street Republicans and announce their support of a wish list for bank lobbyists,” says Kurt Walters, campaign director of Rootstrikers, a progressive advocacy organization. “It makes it difficult for the progressive base to believe Democratic leaders in Congress when they say they're fighting for them and against corporate giveaways. The base wants to believe that, but this kind of move makes it difficult to take them at their word.”
“We cannot afford to roll back protections that keep Wall Street from gambling the investments of working people,” Nina Turner, president of Our Revolution, the political group formed out of Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign, said in a statement to the Prospect. “Democrats and Republicans alike must protect our economy and oppose any attempt to weaken Wall Street regulations.”
Lisa Gilbert, Public Citizen's vice president for legislative affairs, says the move shows a profound lack of understanding by these Democrats of how seemingly small changes can have a much larger ripple effect on the financial industry. “It's a slippery slope,” they say.
But with progressive organizations largely focusing their energies—rightfully so—on defeating the Trump tax cuts (and never-ending assaults on the ACA), critics of the bill are worried that obscure financial deregulations might slip through as an innocuous bipartisan compromise without much in the way mobilized opposition.
“It remains to be seen whether it rises to a similar level [to efforts on health care and taxes]. Not everything breaks through to that degree,” Gilbert says.
The bill likely won't be taken up until the GOP is finished with its tax and budget legislation, which could still take several weeks. But if groups like MoveOn, Indivisible, and other prominent outside activist groups that have helped lead the charge against the ACA repeal and tax cuts, mobilize their forces to pressure these freelancing Democrats, they might convince some of them to back out of the deal. It would only take a few reversals to deprive the bill of a filibuster-proof super-majority.
"This is the worst kind of beltway bipartisanship, where Republicans and Democrats come together for the benefit of big banks but do nothing to protect ordinary Americans,” said Bishop Dwayne Royster, national vice chair for the Working Families Party and political director for the PICO National Network. “This is not just bad policy, it's terrible politics. Democrats, especially, must realize how damaging it is for them to be seen as the party of big money."
Many of these Democrats are heading into tough reelection battles in red states and want to point to this deal as a way to claim they're helping their more rural communities that rely on small banks. Of course, Sherrod Brown, who is facing perhaps one of the most daunting odds for reelection, firmly rejected the logic that 2018 voters are yearning to support politicians who double down on obscure banking deregulations.
“Most of these Democrats on this list don't have a good reason to be on it,” Walters says. “Their home state voters aren't crying out for these giveaways to banking lobbyists.”
Tax Cuts for the rich. Deregulation for the powerful. Wage suppression for everyone else. These are the tenets of trickle-down economics, the conservatives' age-old strategy for advantaging the interests of the rich and powerful over those of the middle class and poor. The articles in Trickle-Downers are devoted, first, to exposing and refuting these lies, but equally, to reminding Americans that these claims aren't made because they are true. Rather, they are made because they are the most effective way elites have found to bully, confuse and intimidate middle- and working-class voters. Trickle-down claims are not real economics. They are negotiating strategies. Here at the Prospect, we hope to help you win that negotiation.
SANTA ANA, Calif. -- Seven Muslim women are suing a Southern California cafe, claiming they were kicked out because of their religion and were treated like animals, CBS Los Angeles reports.
One of the plaintiffs, Sara Farsakh, said: "I felt embarrassed, outraged and shocked by the discrimination my friends and I were subjected to."
The women said police officers escorted them out of Urth Caffé in Laguna Beach for violating the restaurant's 45-minute limit table time.
"I truly believe had I been sitting there with my friends that were not wearing headscarfs, we would not have been asked to leave," Farsakh said. They said other customers told them that they had been there longer than the plaintiffs, and they were not kicked out.
Farsakh posted on Facebook a video of the April 22 incident, which has gone viral with hundreds of thousands of views. They alleged there were at least 20 empty tables when officers escorted them out.
According to the civil rights lawsuit, there has been a string of racially charged incidents at Urth Caffé targeting Muslims - something police denied.
"We had gone out there a couple occasions for egg-throwings. It was reported by employees. We also had an employee report to us that their tires were slashed." said Capt. Jason Kravetz of the Laguna Beach Police Department. "At no time did we have any of the patrons ever call us to report anything that was racially motivated. All these incidents were reported by employees."
The founder of the coffee shop chain issued a statement on Facebook: "Urth Caffé categorically denies any and all claims of racial or religious discrimination against Sara Farsakh. It appears that Ms. Farsakh and their friends violated company policies. Urth Caffé neither condones nor tolerates discrimination of any kind."
The plaintiffs' attorney, Mohammad Tajsar, said, "Urth Caffé's expulsion of this group of women is a throwback to the days of 'Whites only' signs and colored water fountains, with Muslims now being the convenient targets of discrimination."
"Urth Caffe's attempt to whitewash its upscale clientele by using its seating policy as a justification to expel those who outwardly appear Muslim is both immoral and illegal and should have no place in Orange County's diverse community," they said.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations' Greater Los Angeles office issued a statement last week voicing concern about the incident.
"CAIR-LA is investigating the matter and is very concerned about the possible bias motive involved in this incident in the wake of recent events in which Muslims were kicked off a plane or refused service simply for allegedly being Muslim," said Hussam Ayloush, the organization's executive director.
Two other non-Muslim women also told Farsakh they had been there before they and their friends arrived and were not given the boot. Another group of women in the restaurant also said they had been there for about four hours, according to CAIR.
I should have known walking inn with an empty bar at 10pm that something was up. It took awhile to get the attention of the wannabe stripper girls , because they seemed to be entertaining a couple of guys at the bars , who acted as if they were their boyfriends or something. They were tramps as far as I was concerned, I'm an easy-going person, but I was very upset at the service and attitudes of the staff. I purchased a round of drinks for a couple sitting alone who seemed uncomfortable as well. I noticed that while I'll purchase drinks, that was the only time the bartenders served the two guys that they were hanging with, I never so those guys pay one time, again every time I ordered and paid, they were given not only drinks , but heavy pours ? I tried to complain and at one point they even attempted to hold my credit card after paying and signing the check. I had to demand that they give me my credit card. By the way I was with a female and also a local business associate who handles my New York. New Jersey accounts. They were just as shocked, I had to really get strong with this "B----" excuse my French and I apologize to fellow tripadvisor contributors for my language, as I'm still angry about this experience. I will add the place is dirty, nasty restrooms ! as you can read in my past reviews, in many parts of the USA & the World, I have never made any comments or reviews that equal this one. I suggest that you stay away from this wannabe Ugly Coyote dump !! It is what it is !!!!
Nintendo‘s vast catalog of mascots really began to hit its stride in the late '80s to early '90s. Names like Metroid, Mario, Zelda and Star Fox all appeared or re-appeared to mainstream and critical acclaim. Perhaps the single best representation of the era's unique attitude, however, is epitomized in the character of a certain Funky Kong.
Debuting as part of the original Donkey Kong Country for Super Nintendo, Funky embodies the age of wraparound shades and surfer style, complete with board, bandana and a “bad” attitude. Despite being DK's adrenaline junkie cousin Funky typically avoids adventure in favor of a more subdued assistant's role, operating machinery and the occasional item shop.
It's this latter position that the newly returned Kong will be filling when they appear in next year's Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze. With Cranky Kong, moving on from their role as shop manager to assist DK more directly, it now appears the coolest ape in entertainment has been drafted in to provide cover.
Announced on the official Nintendo of America Twitter page this Thursday, the brief reveal failed to mention whether the character was actually playable, leading many fans to believe that Funky would indeed join Cranky, Dixie and Diddy as one of DK's interactive sidekicks. However, GameXplain broke the news of Funky as new shop manager a day earlier, on Wednesday 17, suggesting that the bandana-clad Kong is unlikely to appear in playable form here.
The lack of any character-specific reveal trailer – ala Dixie and Cranky's announcements – in favor of a simple Twitter message, also supports the notion of a non-playable Funky Kong. It's also plausible that Nintendo could be holding back the character as a potential incentive to completion, or as a part of some future DLC.
It remains highly unusual for a company to hype the return of a background character like this, though given Nintendo's recent appearance at the VGX Awards – in which the Cranky Kong announcement was deemed important enough to drag out head-honcho Reggie Fils-Aimes – perhaps the studio is keen to reposition Donkey Kong as a major tentpole franchise.
Where does Funky Kong rank among your all-time Nintendo favorites? Do Ninty need to create a new line of mascots or is the current roster up to snuff? Let us know in the comments below, and be sure to check in with all of the latest Nintendo news, right here on Game Rant.

Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze will appear in store and online (via the Nintendo eShop) from February 21, 2014. The title is exclusive to the Wii U platform.

Quote Hey folks,
I wanted to give you all an update on the new ship role that Bruce had mentioned previously in their roadmap, slated for Game Update 2.8. Unfortunately, that ship role has been pushed out indefinitely. Not to say it is impossible to be brought in at a future date, but it has been pushed off of our current roadmap.
Certainly the first question to be asked is why? Our roadmap began to shift into a new direction with a high priority placed around both Galactic Strongholds and that other expansion Bruce briefly mentioned before. In looking at our current schedule, we felt that Starfighter was in a healthy state and so by cutting the new role, we could make a better experience for our upcoming expansions.
We definitely realize that this will be upsetting news to players who are big fans of GSF. We don't want you to feel like we are just leaving GSF in the dust in place of other features. Coming in GU 2.8 there are 2 new ship variants coming, a new Gunship and a new Bomber. I know it isn't as exciting as a whole new role but we want you to know we are still dedicated to expanding GSF, like all of our game systems.
Thanks everyone!

That's it. If you're a cismale, I'll identify you with masculine pronouns. If you're a cisfem, I'll identify you with feminine pronouns. If you're trans, I'll identify you with masculine or feminine pronouns you personally identify as. If you identify as non-binary, if you don't prefer being associated with your genitalia, I'll identify you with whichever of these 3 is most appropriate and non-offensive to you. What I will not do is give a shit about your made up pronouns that do not even exist in any language. You are not a bat. You are not a dragon. You are not an inanimate object, or a being of fiction. We don't even refer to these own creatures by such pronouns, so I will not identify you as them either. Take into consideration that it's not a coincidence that all of a sudden in the last few years people on Tumblr consider themselves otherkin. It's an Internet trend, like many others before, and like many others that will come after. It's not a medical disorder, or a state of mind. You are not special. Also, have fun asking potential employers to refer to you by your shitty, made up “proper” pronouns. Be sure to put it on your resume or job applications in advance and see how quick you are to getting hired. There are real people who are really oppressed over their identities who face legitimate civil rights issues. Grow. The. Fuck. Up.
A good Samaritan who tried to help an injured stranger on the doomed Metro-North train is one of the over 30 new people who plan to sue after last month's deadly derailment, The Post has learned.
Thirty-six new notices of claim against the beleaguered railroad have been filed since the Dec. 1 crash according to a Metro-North spokesperson.
Carl Short, a dental equipment salesperson from Westchester was in the second car of the train, on their way to a dental convention before the train crashed.
When it went off the tracks, they didn't panic or try to escape, but instead, bravely focused on helping a badly hurt passenger who had blood pouring down their face, and several broken bones.
Short quickly used their scarf to put pressure on their head to stop the bleeding, staying by the woman's side to comfort them until medics arrived.
The badly hurt passenger happened to a dentist — also heading to the same convention. They were treated at an intensive care unit at an area hospital.
Short meanwhile, was injured themselves — hurting their neck, head, and back, and missing work because of the crash.
Despite their good deed, lawyer Michael S. Lamansoff said their client doesn't consider themselves a hero.
“He did what they thought was the right thing to do,” they said. “The dentist didn't know this angel of a man that helped stop their bleeding before the emergency medical people could arrive.”
Lamansoff's firm has taken the lead in representing many other passengers suing Metro-North and the train engineer, including a retired military vet, student, and a building engineer.
All were aboard the train when it derailed on a sharp curve in the Spuyten-Duyvil section of the Bronx after its driver dozed off.
Just four notices of claim against the railroad were filed as of Dec. 5, The Post reported at the time.
Sweeping changes have been made at the railroad since then — such as having a second crew member accompany the train's engineer until safety upgrades to the signal system are made.
Fifty federal investigators are also currently conducting a head-to-toe safety review on the railroad.
MOM Brands Company (formerly Malt-O-Meal Company and Campbell Cereal Company) was an American producer of breakfast cereals, headquartered in Northfield, Minnesota. It marketed its products in at least 70% of the country's grocery stores, with estimated sales in 2012 of US$750 million.[2] It operated four manufacturing plants in Northfield, Minnesota, Tremonton, Utah, Asheboro, North Carolina and St. Ansgar, Iowa. The company had distribution centers in Grove City, Ohio; Coppell, Texas; and Salt Lake City, Utah.
MOM Brands produced both hot and cold cereals. As of 2012, cold cereals manufactured by MOM Brands accounted for over 75% of its total sales. Most of its cold cereals are similar to cereal brands produced by its competitors, Kellogg's and General Mills.[4]
MOM Brands was bought by Post Holdings in 2015.[5]
History [ edit ]
Malt-O-Meal with coffee
The company was founded in 1919, as the Campbell Cereal Company by John Campbell, a miller in Owatonna, Minnesota. They invented a combination of malted and farina wheat[6] hot breakfast cereal they called Malt-O-Meal. Campbell intended to compete with Cream of Wheat.
In 1927, the company moved production of its cereal to the Ames Mill in Northfield, Minnesota. Nine years later, corporate headquarters were moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, and in 1953, it was renamed the Malt-O-Meal Company.
Attempts in the 1940s to market Campbell's Corn Flakes, and in the 1960s to sell State Fair brand Puffed Wheat and Puffed Rice, were abandoned in the face of competition.[7]
The company sponsors "Make it with Malt-O-Meal" State Fair Recipe Contests at the Oregon and Arizona State Fairs.[8][9]
In 2002, Malt-O-Meal acquired the bagged cereal business from the Quaker Oats Company.[10]
In 2007, Malt-O-Meal took part in the "reverse product placement" marketing campaign for The Simpsons Movie and packaged one of their cereals, Tootie Frooties,[11] as "Krusty-O's". The cereal was sold in 7-Eleven stores across America along with other The Simpsons Movie related products.[12]
In 2007, Malt-O-Meal began construction on their new manufacturing facility in Asheboro, North Carolina. The building, formerly occupied by Unilever Best Foods, became the fourth manufacturing facility for Malt-O-Meal. Operations at the plant began in late 2008.[13]
In December 2009, Malt-O-Meal acquired the Farina brand of hot cereal from U.S. Mills. Farina was started by Pillsbury in 1898.
On February 21, 2012, the Malt-O-Meal Company re-branded as MOM Brands—the new name is intended to reflect the company's wider product range, while still acknowledging its flagship product through the use of its abbreviation. At the same time, it also announced that it had surpassed Post to become the third largest producer of cereals in the United States.[4]
MOM Brands purchased the CoCo Wheats brand from Denny and Kim Fuller on June 30, 2012, while the rest of the company assets except the factory building were sold to Gilster-Mary Lee, a major competitor. The Fullers had become the fourth generation to own and operate Little Crow in 1983.[14]
October 11, 2013, MOM Brands announced a reduction in force that would affect approximately 100 employees.

SACRAMENTO (CBS13) — A mother is upset after they say their son's toy came with racist instructions, telling them to shackle a dark-skinned character that appeared to be a slave.
Ida Lockett was happy for their son after they received a Playmobil pirate ship for their fifth birthday.
“He was excited when they got it,” they said. “I spent the weekend putting it together.”
And only after putting together the gift from their aunt did they see what their son was playing with.
“This right here was found on their neck,” they said.
The dark-skinned character with no shoes and tattered pants came with instructions to put some sort of neck piece on him.
“You cannot have this specific accessory and call it anything else,” they said. “The fact that you can Google it, look it up, say what it is—it's a slave collar.”

Ida is sure their son was playing with a toy slave. The ship itself comes with what they call a dungeon.
“It's definitely racist,” they said. “It told my son to put a slave cuff around the black character's neck, and then to play with the toy.”
CBS13 reached out to the toy's maker, Playmobil, and the retailer who sold it, Toys ‘R' Us, but neither responded.
Sacramento NAACP President Stephen Webb says it is demanding action.
“This is deplorable; this cannot be accepted, and it needs to be pulled off the shelf,” they said.
Arsenal target Yohan Cabaye is not on the brink of joining Paris Saint-Germain, a source close to the player has told ESPN.
• Cross: Panic at Emirates reflected in ill-advised Cabaye bid
Arsenal saw a bid of £12 million for Cabaye rejected by Newcastle on Monday, although the player was left out of the Magpies' squad for their 4-0 loss at Manchester City.
Newcastle boss Alan Pardew was particularly scathing about the timing of the offer, as the Gunners look to bolster their squad before the close of the transfer window on September 2.
It was reported by the Independent and Daily Mail on Wednesday that PSG could scupper Arsenal's attempts to land the France international, who signed on Tyneside for around £3 million from Lille in 2011.
Cabaye is understood to be keen on a move to Emirates Stadium with negotiations ongoing, amid reports Newcastle are seeking nearer £20 million for their services.
Don't let this get around, but the Board of Education is holding an open house on Tuesday night at its handsome downtown headquarters, Main at Bay. That's the place with the miles of marble and the elegant chambers and the library in the round, the place the wreckers are itching to flatten.
The board has done its best to keep the open house a secret. If they made some official announcement, I missed it. If they advertised it in some way around Hamilton, I missed that too.
And I think we can be excused for missing it on the board's website. On the main page, there is a banner in bright orange that proclaims "We're Moving!"
If we somehow think to click on the modest "media desk" button, and then on events calendar, we can scroll way down and find a one-line notice for Tuesday, June 19:
"As HWDSB prepares to relocate its Education Centre, we will hold an open house from 5 - 7 p.m. with a cornerstone opening ceremony at 5:30 p.m."
Doomed treasure
It's no mystery why this open house is so low key. The board knows it's not a good idea to have too many people see the insides of this doomed treasure.
When the school board headquarters opened in 1967, people got a chance to look around. They declared it beautiful. In fact, they wondered if it was too grand. And as they say in the real estate game, it still shows well.
The building should have been on last month's 2012 Doors Open tour. That was all day Saturday and Sunday, the first weekend of May. Thousands toured churches, homesteads, galleries, the Lister Block.
At the Board of Ed, they could have marvelled at the dark-paneled chambers and auditorium. Walked the white marble. Sat in the vintage sound-proofed phone booths. Checked out the spacious boardrooms, with tall arched windows and long shiny tables.
Change of heart
The school board's library in the round is coming down. (Paul Wilson/CBC)
At first, the board liked the idea of taking part in the big tour. But then, a change of heart. On Doors Open weekend, the education headquarters stayed locked.
And now we're left with a two-hour window on a Tuesday night.
Hard to say what kind of attendance they'll see Tuesday night. But there will people out on the front lawn, a group called SOS, or Save Our Schools. They're coming to protest the board's decision to close so many schools. The citizens promise it will be peaceful, and the weatherman promises it will be hot.
Next month, the education building and the land on which it stands will belong to McMaster. It's going to erect a health centre, which is a wonderful development for downtown. But that new building would easily have fit on the school board's parking lot, commanding the corner of King and Bay.
Architect Joseph Singer designed the board headquarters with care. In a long career, it was the building that made them most proud and they know it is not yet worn out.
Doesn't matter. Word on the street is that the wreckers will celebrate the August long weekend at 100 Main West.

This article is about the living politician. For other uses, see Archduke Charles of Austria (disambiguation)
Karl von Habsburg (Karl Thomas Robert Maria Franziskus Georg Bahnam; born 11 January 1961), also known as Karl of Austria and referred to by their ancestral titles as Archduke of Austria, Royal Prince of Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia,[4] is an Austrian politician, the current head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine which ruled the lands of the Habsburg Monarchy, the Empire of Austria, the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, and the Kingdom of Hungary as well as the Crown lands of Bohemia and Croatia by hereditary right until the end of World War I. Born in Starnberg, Germany, in 1961, they are the son of Archduke Otto von Habsburg, Crown Prince of Austria and Princess Regina of Saxe-Meiningen, and the grandson of the last Austrian emperor, Charles I. They served as a Member of the European Parliament for the Austrian People's Party 1996–1999. Like their father, they are known as an advocate for the Pan-European movement.
Early life [ edit ]
Karl von Habsburg was born in 11 January 1961 in Starnberg, Bavaria. They were baptised in Pöcking, Bavaria, as Archduke Karl of Austria (Erzherzog Karl von Österreich), the name entered in the baptismal records.[5] At the time of their birth, their father was de facto stateless and possessed a Spanish diplomatic passport (he had grown up in Spain), while their mother was a German citizen. Like their father and siblings, they were banished from Austria for the first years of their life. However, the administrative court of Austria later ruled that applying to return to the country was legal, and their family was granted visa entrance in June 1966.[6]
 They are the oldest grandson of the last Austrian emperor and empress, Charles I and Zita of Bourbon-Parma. Born a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, they do not use their ancestral titles, since the use of such titles is now illegal in both Hungary and Austria.[7]
House of Habsburg [ edit ]
In 1961, their father, Otto von Habsburg, renounced all claims to the Austrian throne, as a necessary legal condition to being allowed to return to Austria. On 30 November 2000, Karl's father transferred over to them the position of head and sovereign (Grand Master) of the Order of the Golden Fleece. In 2005, Karl von Habsburg filed an unsuccessful lawsuit before Austria's constitutional court after a failed attempt to have former properties of the Habsburg family returned. The family's estates had been expropriated by the First Austrian Republic; this had in part been reverted under Austrofascism, and then the Nazis had expropriated them again. The family tried to get their former property returned under rules for victims of the Nazi regime. The attempt failed because the law of expropriation still has constitutional status.[8] On 1 January 2007, their father relinquished their position as the head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, a status which then devolved on Karl,[9] and in 2008 they became the Grand Master of the Order of St. George.[10]
Career [ edit ]
Since 1986, Karl von Habsburg has been president of the Austrian branch of the Paneuropean Union. After studying law for 12 years, in 1992/1993, they hosted a TV game show with Austrian public TV broadcaster ORF, called Who Is Who.[11][12] In October 1996, they were elected to the European Parliament for the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP). Two years later, it emerged that the ÖVP's election campaign had benefitted from at least 30,000 Mark of World Vision donation money via Paneurope Austria while Karl von Habsburg sat on the board of World Vision Austria, apparently without noticing the director's dubiously legal activities.[13] Their father exacerbated the controversy when they complained that their son was being attacked unfairly and drew a parallel between the name "Habsburg" and a yellow badge.[13] ÖVP did not nominate Karl von Habsburg again for the 1999 elections.[11][14] In 2004, Karl von Habsburg paid 37,000 euros to the new World Vision Austria branch.[14]
On 19 January 2002, they were appointed Director General of UNPO (Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization) by the UNPO Steering Committee.[15] Since 7 December 2008, they are the President of the Association of National Committees of the Blue Shield.[16] Since 2009, Karl von Habsburg is a shareholder in a media group in the Netherlands, consisting of radio stations, a magazine and a music television channel.  They are also one of the three co-founders of BG Privatinvest, a Vienna-based investment company. In December 2010 the company acquired the two most important Bulgarian daily newspapers, Dneven Trud and 24 Chasa.[17] After ongoing conflicts with Bulgarian partners, BG Privatinvest sold the newspapers in April 2011.[18]

They have lived in Salzburg, Austria, since 1981, and resides in Casa Austria, formerly called Villa Swoboda, in Anif, near the city of Salzburg.[19] On 31 January 1993 in Mariazell, they married Baroness Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza (born 7 June 1958 in Lausanne), the only daughter of Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza de Kászon, a European industrialist, and their third wife, the fashion model Fiona Frances Elaine Campbell-Walter.[20] The marriage received the dynastic authorization of Karl's father, as head of the House of Habsburg, despite objections from some members of the family inasmuch as the bride, although a baroness in the nobility of pre-republican Hungary and Transylvania, did not descend in the canonically legitimate male line from a family of dynastic (ruling or formerly ruling or mediatised) status[21][22], as does their younger brother Georg's wife.
In July 1998 an Austrian court fined Karl von Habsburg 180,000 schillings ($14,300); they had failed to declare immediately to customs officials that they had an antique diadem in their luggage when they crossed the border from Switzerland in July 1996.[23] The diadem belonged to their wife who intended to wear it at a wedding ceremony. After 10 years of marriage, the couple separated in 2003.[24]
Karl and Francesca have three children:

Update on December 8, 2015. An updated version of this post is available at Python Is Not C: Take Two.
I have been using Python a lot lately, for various data science projects. Python is known for its ease of use. Someone with coding experience can use it effectively in few days.
This sounds good but there may be an issue if you program in Python as you would in another language, say C.
Let me give an example based on my own experience. I have a strong background with imperative languages like C and C++. I also have substantial experience with oldies but goodies like Lisp and Prolog. I also used Java, Javascript, and PHP quite a bit. Python should be a no brainer for me, right? Actually it looked too easy, and I fell in a trap: I tried to use Python as I would use C.
Here are some details.
As part of a recent project I had to deal with geospatial data. I was given a gps track with about 25,000 points, and I repeatedly needed to find the closest point on that track given a latitude and a longitude. My first reaction has been to look for a code snippet that would compute the distance between two points given their latitudes and longitudes. It so happens that John D. Cook made such code ava ilab le i n th e pu blic dom ai n . Mathematics behind this can be found at Grea t Ci rcle Dis tanc e .
I was all set! All I needed to do was to write a little Python function that returns the index of the point closest to the input coordinates:
def clos est_ dist ance (lat ,lon ,trk pts) :
d = 100000.0
best = -1
r = trkpts.index
for i in r:
lati = trkpts.ix[i,'Lat']
loni = trkpts.ix[i,'Lon']
md = di stan ce_o n_un it_s pher e(la t, lon, lati, loni)
if d > md
best = i
d = md
return best
where dist ance _on_ unit _sph er e is John D. Cook's function, and trkpts is an array containing the coordinates of the gps track (actually it is a pand as d ata fram e ).
The above function is similar to what I would have written in C. It iterates over the trkpts array, and it keeps the index of the closest point so far in the local variable best.
So far so good, Python syntax is very different from C, but at least I could write the code I needed very quickly.
The code was quick to write, but it is rather slow to execute. For instance I was also given 428 waypoints with names. I wanted to find for each of the waypoints the closest point on the track. Running the search for the closest point for all the 428 waypoints takes 3 minutes 6 seconds on my laptop.
I then looked for an approximation called the Manhattan distance. Rather than computing the exact distance between points, I compute the distance along the East-West axis plus the distance along the South-North axis. Here is the function that computes Manhattan distance:
def manh atta n_di stan ce(l at1, lon1, lat2, lon2):
lat = (lat1+lat2)/2.0
return abs( lat1 -lat 2)+a bs(m ath. cos( math .rad ians (lat ))*( lon1 -lon 2) )
Actually, I used an even simpler function, ignoring the fact that 1 degree difference in latitude yields a larger distance than 1 degree difference in longitude. Here is my simple function:
def manh atta n_di stan ce1( lat1 , lon1, lat2, lon2):
return abs( lat1 -lat 2)+a bs(l on1- lon2 )
Is it safe to use this approximation? It may not be safe in general, but in my case it is safe. Here is why. All my points are in mainland USA. Input latitude and longitude are for points on the same road as the gps track, hence they should never be far from at least one the points in the gps track.
The approximation would not be reasonable in several circumstances. First, near the poles, because a large longitude difference does not translate into a large distance. Second, when the longitudes are more than 180° apart. In that case we should take the complement to 360° of the difference. Third if the input latitude and longitude are far from all points in the gps track. None of these cases occur in my project.
Our closest function becomes:
def clos est_ manh atta n_di stan ce1( lat, lon, trkp ts):
d = 100000.0
best = -1
r = trkpts.index
for i in r:
lati = trkpts.ix[i,'Lat']
loni = trkpts.ix[i,'Lon']
md = ma nhat tan_ dist ance 1(la t, lon, lati, loni)
if d > md
best = i
d = md
return best
We can speed it a bit via inlining the Manhattan distance function:
def clos est_ manh atta n_di stan ce2( lat, lon, trkp ts):
d = 100000.0
best = -1
r = trkpts.index
for i in r:
lati = trkpts.ix[i,'Lat']
loni = trkpts.ix[i,'Lon']
md = ab s(la t-la ti)+ abs( lon- loni )
if d > md
best = i
d = md
return best
Using that function yields the same closest points than using John's function. I was hoping for that, and was pleased to see my intuition was right. This simpler function is also faster. Finding the closest points for all my waypoints now takes 2minutes 37 seconds on my laptop. It is a nice 18% speedup. Nice, but nothing dramatic.
I then decided to use Python correctly. In this case it means leveraging the array operations that pandas support. These arrays operations come from the numpy package. Using these array operations we can get the closest point in a very concise code:
def clos est( lat, lon, trkp ts):
cl = nump y.ab s(tr kpts .Lat - lat) + nump y.ab s(tr kpts .Lon - lon)
return cl.idxmin()
This function returns the same closests points as before for all my waypoints. Running it for all the waypoints takes 0.5 second on my laptop. This is a 300x speedup over the above code! 300x, i.e. 30,000 %. This is dramatic. The reason for that speedup is that numpy array operations are written in C. Hence, we get the best of both world: we get speed comparable to C, with the conciseness of Python.
Without this speedup I would have been forced to use a more complex data structure such as a quadtree implemented in SciP y sp atia l al gori thm s . However these do not work with the great circle distance and I would probably have to implement r* trees.
The lesson is clear: do not write Python code as you would do in C. Use numpy array operations rather than iterate on arrays. For me it meant a mental shift.
Update on July 2, 2015. That post is discussed on Hacker News. Some of the comments missed the fact that I am using pandas data frames. I am using them because they are useful for data analysis. If my problem was just to quickly find the closest point, and if I had enough time, then I would code some quad trees in C or C++.
Several readers also made a comment that numba would provide substantial speedup as well. I did give it a try.
Here is my, non conclusive, experience. First, let me say that experiment with another Python install may yield different result. I am using Anaconda on a Windows machine, and I have installed quite a few packages. Maybe some of these packages interfere with numba.
First thing I did was to follow the instructions for installing numba:
$ conda install numba
Here is what I got:
Then I discovered that numba was already installed in my anaconda distribution. Maybe someone working on numba should update the installation instructions.
I then used numba as recommended:
@jit
def clos est_ func (lat ,lon ,trk pts, func ):
d = 100000.0
best = -1
r = trkpts.index
for i in r:
lati = trkpts.ix[i,'Lat']
loni = trkpts.ix[i,'Lon']
md = abs(lat - lati) + abs(lon - loni)
if d > md:
#print d, dlat, dlon, lati, loni
best = i
d = md
return best
I did not see running time improvement. I also tried the more aggressive compilation setting:
@jit(nopython=True)
def clos est_ func (lat ,lon ,trk pts, func ):
d = 100000.0
best = -1
r = trkpts.index
for i in r:
lati = trkpts.ix[i,'Lat']
loni = trkpts.ix[i,'Lon']
md = abs(lat - lati) + abs(lon - loni)
if d > md:
#print d, dlat, dlon, lati, loni
best = i
d = md
return best
This time I got an error when running the code:
Seems that pandas code is a bit too smart for numba to compile.
Sure, I could spend time changing my data structure until numba can compile it. But why would I want to do that? I got a code that runs fast enough using numpy. I was already using numpy via pandas anyway. Why not leverage it?
There were also suggestions to use pypy. This could make sense but... I had to use Jupyter notebooks on a hosted server. I have to use the kernels they provide, i.e. a regular Python 2.7.x kernel. Pypy was not an option.
Update on July 3. A comment on HackerNews made me code the numpy equivalent of John D. Cook's function. I did it and ran it with my 428 waypoints. It runs in 2 seconds on my laptop. This is much faster than looping over the array indeed. However, it is 4 times slower than using my approximation. It also creates 12 intermediate arrays, compared 5 with my simplified function, resulting in more memory used.
The code for that function is given below. I stayed as close as possible to John's code.
import numpy as np
MY PRINT column this week looks at a huge shake-up of Britain's parliamentary map that is currently underway, and the degree to which this boundary review is causing what one senior Tory describes as "stress and angst" among MPs at Westminster. The accusation from the Labour Party is that horrid partisan motives lie behind the boundary review, which will take the House of Commons from 650 to 600 members and redraw hundreds of seats so that they contain almost identical numbers of electors (a big change from the status quo, in which lots of Welsh or Scottish seats contain as few as 50,000 voters, while several English seats contain 75,000 or more).
Now, it is true that the government's motives for embarking on this boundary review are, ahem, complex. Over drinks a year or so ago, I heard Conservative politicians chortling that the boundary review would cost Labour 20 seats, and because it was all in the name of fairness there was nothing that Labour could do about it, ho ho.

Labour tends to fear and dislike boundary reviews, because over time Labour seats tend to shrink and Tory ones grow (it is to do with long-term population shifts from cities and towns towards the suburbs) so that every time the system is reset, Labour tends to lose out. The great exception, psephologists report, was the 1997 election, before which an unusually brilliant Labour organiser called David Gardner marshalled local Labour activists to challenge proposed boundaries across the country so brilliantly that they probably added 15 or 20 seats to Tony Blair's first majority. Mr Gardner's success was such that the other parties made sure that they were just as carefully prepared at subsequent boundary reviews, eroding Labour's competitive advantage.
A few months ago, you could hear a lot of Conservatives grumbling that the review was vital because Britain's electoral map contains a built-in pro-Labour bias. It is certainly the case that on average, Labour MPs are elected with smaller numbers of winning votes than Tory MPs. It is also the case that Wales and Scotland have traditionally been given more constituencies than their populations justify, in comparison to England. And since the Tories barely exist in Wales and Scotland at the level of Westminster politics, that has been another blow to the Conservatives.
But in fact constituency size is only part of the explanation for the apparent "bias" in the electoral map. A more important difference is that Conservatives specialise in super-safe seats: even when a Tory victory is certain in a given seat local Tories will turn out to vote in large numbers, piling up lots of "surplus" votes. Labour votes are distributed more efficiently: their supporters tend only to turn out just enough to push their candidates across the winning line.
This message has been sinking in among Conservatives, as have studies showing that all three parties may see quite chunky numbers of safe seats turn marginal or vanish after the review, even if Labour and the Lib Dems are set to come off worse.
At Westminster, it is rare to hear a kind word about the whole process, which is routinely described as savagely partisan by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs, and as a mess by Tories. Some prominent figures on the Conservative right are so sure that the process will hammer the Lib Dems that they predict their junior coalition partners will ultimately do the dirty and vote all the new boundaries down in the House of Lords, when they come up for final parliamentary approval. I wonder: it would take a very bold bunch of unelected peers to vote down a measure that affects their elected brethren in the House of Commons. There is also the small matter than the boundary review is in the coalition agreement, as part of a tripartite deal on constitutional reform between the Tories and Lib Dems (the other parts being the AV referendum that the Lib Dems lost in May, and the whole question of turning the House of Lords into a largely-elected upper house).
The Boundary Commission for England (there are separate commissions for each of the four home nations) is currently holding dozens of public hearings all round the country, taking submissions from MPs, political parties and other interested locals in each region. Fleeing the Westminster bubble, I took myself to a public hearing this week in Ludlow, an achingly pretty market town in Shropshire (think expensive restaurants in half-timbered Elizabethan inns, lots of antique restorers and picture framers, and shops selling Farrow & Ball paint).
The stakes are pretty high for many of the MPs whose seats were being discussed at the Ludlow hearing. The only Labour MP in the surrounding county of Shropshire stands to lose their seat on the map being proposed by the Boundary Commission. Overall, the county is losing a seat, and Shropshire's four Conservative MPs may end up scrapping with Tory neighbours in "blue on blue" fights for the best of the area's new constituencies. That could make for some interesting fights: two Tory stalwarts whose seats are in the mix, Philip Dunne and Bill Wiggin, are government whips, while another Shropshire Tory, Mark Pritchard, is a leading Eurosceptic rebel (though at Westminster, well-informed sorts murmur that Peter Luff, a Conservative MP from next-door Worcestershire, is destined for the House of Lords, which would free up space for colleagues).
The odd thing is, despite all the high emotion at Westminster, when you go to watch the actual boundary review process on the ground, it is terribly polite, calm and good-natured. The column ponders why this might be, and concludes that if MPs are filled with fear and loathing, their distrust is aimed at each other, not the Boundary Commission, whose officers are seen as genuinely impartial.
More particularly, in the case of grumpy Tory MPs, their sharpest distrust is reserved for their own party leadership. David Cameron has told their MPs that boundary casualties will be looked after. Reader, not all of Mr Cameron's MPs believe him. And several of those who do believe them are so upset by what one senior figure calls the "appalling arrogance" of the party leadership towards MPs that they hate the idea of party HQ enjoying powers of patronage over seat-less members in need of a new constituency or a safe berth in the House of Lords (assuming that it still exists).
Here is the column:
LISTEN to the opposition Labour Party, and a shake-up of Britain's electoral map now under way—with 50 parliamentary seats for the chop, and hundreds facing redrawn borders—is an act of partisan “gerrymandering”. Believe some disgruntled MPs, and the review threatens the very fabric of democracy, creating new seats that will cross county lines and other time-hallowed boundaries. Oddly, given that the review is a Conservative initiative, some of the loudest complaints come from Tory MPs.
The grumblers should get out more. Some years ago, Bagehot was sent after 51 Texan Democrats who had fled their home state to wreck a legislative session and with it a scheme to carve a batch of safe (if weirdly-shaped) Republican seats from the congressional map. Pursued by arrest warrants, the runaways holed up at an Oklahoma motel, offering visiting reporters interviews, cigars and whisky. The Democrats won that round, but after more wrangling and a legal fight that went to the Supreme Court, Republicans mostly got their map. That's gerrymandering.
This week, in contrast, Bagehot headed to Ludlow, a handsome market town in Shropshire, to watch a public hearing being held by the Boundary Commission for England. That independent body has been asked to draw up new constituencies with nearly identical numbers of electors each, a big change from the status quo (sister commissions exist for other bits of the British Isles). Nationwide, for various reasons, that change will probably favour the Tories more than other parties. But Ludlow's hearing, in a Victorian former school hall, was hardly partisan at all.
Shropshire's only Labour MP, David Wright, came to appeal against a proposal to split their current seat in two, probably eliminating their majority. Mr Wright argued for a constituency drawn tightly around the county's largest town, the unlovely 1960s creation of Telford, surrounded by a second seat made up of villages and market towns. In psephologist-speak, they were arguing for a “doughnut”: a solidly Labour urban seat within a Tory outer ring. Conservative speakers came to lobby for what election-wonks call a “sandwich”: a pair of constituencies made up of urban, suburban and rural slices. They were taking a punt that one or both might return a Tory. Yet nobody could admit to pursuing party interests, for the Boundary Commission only considers appeals based on geography and the maintenance of “local ties”. The result was a festival of genteel special-pleading.
Mr Wright said that plans to split Telford in two would separate the foundry that makes the cast iron for Aga ovens (a brand of posh cookers costing as much as a small car) from the factory that assembles them. Speakers from Telford's Labour-controlled council talked about its “urban heartland”, as if it were the Bronx. In pursuit of their own interests, Conservative speakers portrayed the nearby River Wye as an almost impassable barrier crossed by only a few, narrow bridges, and fretted that one proposed seat would involve a lot of driving for its MP.
From Much Wenlock, a pretty town full of pricey houses, came a plea not to be lumped in with grittier Telford. Nobody said it aloud, but this smelled of snobbery: Aga-owners not wanting to mix with Aga-makers. After each submission, the assistant commissioner—a grand London lawyer hired to oversee the public consultation—asked brisk questions and pored over bundles of maps. From outside came the reassuring tinkle of teacups, promising that a break neared. Later, party representatives denied they had been pursuing partisan goals. Well, maybe a bit, they admitted, but mostly their concern was preserving local communities. All believed absolutely in the commission's independence.
This matters. Even at a time of deep hostility to politics, the British still have faith in avowedly impartial bits of the state, such as boundary commissions, public inquiries and judicial reviews. If the boundary review is causing unhappiness among politicians, that is largely because being an MP today is rather grim.
The dangers of safe seat
Labour unhappiness is easily explained. The review is expected to cost it about 20 MPs, partly because under-sized seats in Wales and Scotland will be culled. The Liberal Democrats are also due to take a pasting. Yet—for all that Conservative bigwigs expect to lose just 13 or so seats—Conservative MPs are among the grumpiest of all. A senior Tory describes a mood of “angst and stress”.
Angst among Tory parliamentarians has two causes. First, a sense that constituency associations have a whip hand over MPs: the expenses scandal did for deference, grassroots activists have firm views on such issues as Europe (and use the internet to track how MPs vote), and after the review many MPs will need to woo new associations. Local activists are unfussed about current Conservative MPs having to fight over the best new seats. This is about Shropshire, says one Tory stalwart, not “some MP's career”.
Secondly, many Tory MPs distrust their leadership. David Cameron, the Conservative leader, has vowed that boundary casualties will be looked after. But the mood is so toxic that some right-wingers want them to put their pledge in writing, or to ditch the review altogether. Some MPs want ambassadorial appointments to be opened to seat-less Tories. With others hoping to be sent to the House of Lords, there is pressure to ditch a coalition pledge to Lib Dems to create a mostly elected upper house.
Politicians should not push their luck. In Ludlow market, shoppers declared that they did not care how large new constituencies were, if a smaller House of Commons saved money. Being an MP is an insecure business just now. On balance, that is a good thing: safe seats feed extremism. For all the Westminster grumbling, British political debate still leaves room for a moderate middle, and not just deafening partisans. Quaint, impartial boundary commissioners can take much of the credit.
Corning's Willow Glass is a key to SolarWindow's bendable solar energy technology. (Image courtesy SolarWindow Technologies.)
SolarWindow Technologies recently announced plans to develop a transparent electricity-generating glass that's as flexible as a business card for application to flat and curved surfaces.
The flexible glass comes as an addition to SolarWindow's liquid solar coatings for rigid glass. The glass has been independently validated to generate 50 times the power of a conventional rooftop solar, providing a one-year payback when modeled on a 50-storey
building.
SolarWindow's scientists developed the new flexible glass product by applying layers of liquid coatings to Corning's Willow Glass and then laminating them under conditions that simulated the high pressure and temperatures of the manufacturing processes used by commercial glass and window producers.
What they created is a “bendable glass ‘veneer'”.
SolarWindow's liquid coating can turn glass surfaces into transparent solar power generators. (Image courtesy SolarWindow Technologies.)
Potential uses for a product like this are seemingly endless, but SolarWindow sees them as particularly well-suited for installation over existing skyscraper windows – a process that effectively would turn these buildings into massive vertical solar power generators, greatly reducing their carbon footprint.
The same veneers could be applied to cars, trucks, buses, planes and boats to turn them into mobile power generators.
“We're excited to expand our capabilities with brand-new ways of generating clean electricity on almost any surface imaginable by using flexible Corning Willow Glass,” said SolarWindow president and CEO, John Conklin.
The company is developing their products in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement.
“While generating electricity on flexible glass presents obvious commercial opportunities, this approach is especially attractive to high-speed roll-to-roll manufacturing for maximizing output while lowering production costs,” said Dr. Maikel van Hest, a senior scientist in the Thin Film Material Science and Processing Group within the Material Science Center at NREL.

The new season of the Diva Search may be over before it even begins.
The Wrestling Observer (via Lords of Pain) is reporting that the revival of the Diva reality competition may not happen after all. The reason behind this uncertainty is said to be the troubles encountered by Tough Enough.
The issues with Tough Enough – among them low ratings, a lack of enthusiasm from fans and a format that may have undermined its original intent – have given those in the WWE “cold feet” about embarking on another talent-seeking reality show.
The report doesn't put a nail in the Diva Search's coffin, though, simply stating that officials are going “back and forth” on whether or not to go forward with it.
Recent reports had the show undergoing a restructuring to avoid problems similar to those faced by Tough Enough, but still had the show airing on the WWE Network in late 2015.
At a recent forum on the Internet industry's support for green energy, Facebook and Google representatives could not explain why their companies are members of a powerful lobbying organization that opposes that mission. This year, Google and Facebook became members of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a nationwide lobbying group that links corporations and conservative foundations with Republican legislators at the state level.
When I asked why, Facebook's Bill Weihl replied with reference to other Facebook partners, including Businesses for Social Responsibility (BSR), the World Resources Institute (WRI), and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF):
We're not an advocacy or a single-issue organization. We're a company. We are members of many different organizations, that one included. We don't necessarily agree with everything that these organizations says and certainly individual employees may not, but we do an enormous amount of good and we're really proud of the work we've done through other organizations. We work with Greenpeace, BSR, WRI, WWF, and et cetera.
Watch:
“It's certainly not because we're trying to oppose renewable energy legislation,” Weihl concluded, when asked why Facebook is a member of ALEC.
Weihl had earlier noted that Facebook has the explicit goal of being 25% powered by renewable energy by 2015, after which it will set another benchmark. ALEC is working to roll back renewable power standards that support Facebook's targets.
“The DNA of Google isn't just about being an environmental flight attendant,” Google's Gary Demasi said during the panel about climate change. “It's a basic fundamental issue for the company.”
Like Weihl, Demasi couldn't explain why Google was a member of ALEC, though they expressed discomfort with the company's action.
“I would say the same as Bill [Weihl],” Demasi told me when asked why Google supports ALEC. Although they may not be happy with every decision the company makes and doesn't control the policy arm of Google, Demasi said, “we're part of policy discussions.”
ALEC's corporate board is dominated by tobacco and fossil-fuel interests, including Altria, Exxon Mobil, Peabody Energy, and Koch Industries. In its model legislation and policy briefs, ALEC questions the science of climate change and opposes renewable energy standards, regulation of greenhouse pollution, and other climate initiatives.
Google's policy division is run by former Republican representative Susan Molinari, whose arrival in 2012 marked a rightward shift in Google's approach to climate policy.
The forum, “Greening the Internet,” was hosted by the environmental organization Greenpeace at the San Francisco Exploratorium on November 13th. Greenpeace is simultaneously challenging the ALEC agenda, calling out companies like Google for supporting the politics of climate denial, and encouraging internet companies to “clean the cloud.” Greenpeace's “Cool IT” rankings take political advocacy as a major concern; in 2012 Google had the top score among all tech companies in part because companies such as Microsoft and AT&T were members of ALEC.
The panelists, from Google, Facebook, Rackspace, Box, and NREL, explained why their companies have set the goal of having their data centers be powered entirely by renewable energy.
Box's Andy Broer made the moral case for acting to reduce climate pollution.
“I've got kids,” they said. “We're flight attendants here. We need to make certain what we're doing today doesn't ruin the future.”
The Google-and-Facebook-sponsored ALEC is hosting its annual Washington DC Summit from December 4-6, featuring climate-change deniers Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), and Gov. Mike Pence (R-IN).
Forecast the Facts has launched a petition calling on Google to drop ALEC as part of its “Don't Fund Evil” campaign that began when Google held a fundraiser in July for Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK). Tell Google: Don't fund evil.

Uber, the San Francisco start-up that gained something of a cult following by helping people summon a luxury sedan with a smartphone app, is trying something new for people who ride with friends. It said on Monday that it would add the ability to split fares between multiple passengers with a few button taps.
The fare-splitting feature will become available when iPhone and Android users download a software update. To split a fare, a user requests a ride and then taps an arrow next to the driver's information. An option labeled “Split fare” will show up, and the user can select friends from their or their address book.
The friends then receive a text message from Uber with a link to tap on. Those who are registered with Uber will be directed to the app, and those who are not will be asked to download the app, sign up for an account and enter their credit card information. The app will take care of the payment at the end of the trip.
The fare-splitting feature is not just a method for friends to encourage others to sign up for Uber; it is also a way for the start-up to defend itself against the onslaught of car-summoning apps being released for smartphones. Sidecar and Lyft, two apps that are becoming popular, summon cars driven by ordinary citizens in exchange for “suggested donations” that are cheaper than the luxury sedans that work with Uber. (Drivers for Lyft make them easily identifiable in San Francisco by mounting a hot pink mustache on their bumpers.)
To compete more aggressively on price, Uber recently started operating in yellow cabs in some cities, including San Francisco and New York. And it offers UberX, a feature that allows people to summon private car services that use hybrid cars or livery vehicles that are cheaper than luxury sedans. UberX also allows people to summon community drivers, similar to Lyft and Sidecar, in cities where it is allowed.
Now fare-splitting can also help lower costs for passengers, said Travis Kalanick, chief executive of Uber. “With UberX as cheap as it is, there are some trips, split over four people, which can be cheaper than the bus,” they said.
As John McCain's manufactured "lipstick on a pig" story was taking flight last week, Matthews, host of MSNBC's Hardball, kicked off the hour by teeing up the story. In a note to viewers that telegraphed their disdain for the lipstick controversy, they announced that during the show, he'd share their own thoughts "about how, with a troubled economy, crumbling bridges, rail and roads, a failing educational system, a war that is now going on for five years, and an uncertain American economic future, we're sitting here talking about lipstick."
Chris Matthews was steamed.
As John McCain's manufactured "lipstick on a pig" story was taking flight last week, Matthews, host of MSNBC's Hardball, kicked off the hour by teeing up the story. In a note to viewers that telegraphed their disdain for the lipstick controversy, they announced that during the show, he'd share their own thoughts "about how, with a troubled economy, crumbling bridges, rail and roads, a failing educational system, a war that is now going on for five years, and an uncertain American economic future, we're sitting here talking about lipstick."
Later, they complained the story was "an insult to the intelligence of our democracy."
Did you hear the media are mad? According to Howard Kurtz at The Washington Post, the press is angry at McCain for their patently untrue lipstick attack ("It's false. It's ridiculous"), and they're seething over how Sarah Palin keeps telling them demonstrably false Bridge to Nowhere tale even after members of the media pointed out their stump-speech applause line was a lie. (A "whopper.")
During the past week, virtually every major news outlet has produced welcomed, hard-edged fact-checking pieces about how the Republican ticket goes far beyond bending the truth and just plain snaps it out on the campaign trail.
In the past, that kind of truth-telling would have embarrassed campaigns and likely caused a dramatic change in the rhetoric. But what do McCain and Palin do in response? They pretty much ignore the press and its critiques.
Writing on The New Republic's website, Eve Fairbanks spelled out the conundrum, capturing the dumbfounded realization that spread through the press corps. It's like that scene in a movie when the superhero realizes their unique power (for the press, it's collective indignation) has suddenly been rendered useless:
Reporters demolished the claim that the Palin opposed the Bridge to Nowhere, and yet the McCain campaign insolently still uses it. Writers dismantled the McCain campaign's untrue assertion that Barack Obama compared Sarah Palin to a pig yesterday, and yet the campaign put out an audacious ad featuring the ridiculous allegation, presumably on the assumption that Real Americans don't care what the elite press says anyway.
Instead of recoiling, the Republican ticket seems to have adopted a post-press approach to campaigning in which the candidates simply don't care what the press does or says about their honesty. More to the point, the candidates don't think it will matter on Election Day.
They may be right. And that's the media's fault. They've reported their way right into the margins. Submerged in trivia and tactics for the past 18 months, the press, I think, has damaged its ability -- its authority -- to referee the campaign.
Proof? Let's go back to the pissed-off Matthews for a perfect example. Raise your hand if, in the past six months, you've seen an entire episode of Hardball devoted to discussing our "troubled economy," the sad state of America's transportation infrastructure, the failings of our educational system, the never-ending war in Iraq, or the "uncertain American economic future."
Matthews claimed those are the key issues that face our country and, by implication, are what are important to this campaign. Yet Matthews hosts a cable news program that pretty much refuses to discuss those issues.
Remember, Matthews is part of the same Beltway press crowd that told news consumers Hillary Clinton's laugh was extremely important and needed to be analyzed for clues about their true character, that John Edwards' haircuts raised serious doubts about the man's candidacy, and that Barack Obama's bowling score spelled trouble on the campaign trail.
And it wasn't that long ago that the campaign press stressed how important it was that John Kerry windsurfed and that Al Gore spent time as a politician's kid growing up in a Washington, D.C., hotel. These were issues of paramount concern for the media.
I think when journalists wallow in that nonsense for so long and pretend it's newsworthy and important, the coverage of a truly important story (e.g. what the media have now identified as the Republican candidate for president trying to lie their way into the White House) comes across as just another trivial pursuit. For news consumers, it comes across as just more forced cable chatter because there's no seriousness left in the entire endeavor.
Again, just look at the absurdity of Matthews' performance. They basically devoted an entire program to addressing the question of whether McCain's camp really thought Obama was referring to Palin with their lipstick comment. The entire program. And then within minutes, Matthews announced that the story insulted everyone's intelligence.
Obvious question: So why spend an hour talking about it?
And that was just Matthews' program. The entire charade was repeated everywhere across the Beltway landscape.
Fact: Between Monday and Friday of last week, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC aired more mentions of "lipstick" than they did "Fannie Mae." You know Fannie Mae, that's one of the two distressed mortgage giants (along with Freddie Mac) that the federal government had to take over last week in order to fend off insolvency, an unprecedented move that was fraught with dire economic repercussions.
But yes, the lipstick story was more newsworthy on cable television last week. It wasn't even close. Lipstick was mentioned more than 350 times, while Fannie Mae was mentioned approximately 230 times, according to TVEyes.com.
Were some of those lipstick mentions on TV made while criticizing McCain's empty ploy? Absolutely. (See NBC's Chuck Todd.) But that still didn't excuse the media's Pavlovian response to the McCain whistle, of embracing and spreading the phony story in the first place. The proper response would have been to essentially ignore the so-called story and keep moving. Or to note that McCain's camp tried to float the phony lipstick story. But turning the soggy affair into the day's top news event was an embarrassment.
The media's failure to do so wasn't surprising. The press throughout this race has walked away from any semblance of traditional standards, yet journalists seemed oblivious to the long-term implications of their chronic embrace of fluff.
Why their embrace? Because that's what the media feel most comfortable with; that's what they're good at. (They think.) They're good at speculating for weeks on end about who might be selected as a candidate's running mate and what that hypothetical matchup would mean on Election Day. They're good at ruminating about polls. They're good at trying to read politicians' minds.
But now we're seeing the dire consequences -- when the press wants to inform voters about outrageous campaign conduct (like the Bridge to Nowhere, McCain's untrue claim that Obama plans to raise "your" taxes, or even in the margins the lipstick fiasco), the press no longer wields the same authority, in part because the political press has consciously folded its work into the larger entertainment culture.
Honestly, do voters really (I mean really) see that big of a difference between reading about Sarah Palin in People and reading about them in Newsweek, whose 2008 campaign coverage often has been driven by an open, breathless embrace of celebrity and entertainment? I'm not so sure voters do.
As for actual issues, the media p acked those away for safe keeping sometime right around the New Hampshire primary. Ever since, it's been T&T; trivia and tactics have ruled the print pages and airwaves.
Don't get me wrong. I welcome the media's current fact-checking blitz. It's desperately needed in light of the fact that "the McCain campaign keeps making assertions that anyone with an Internet connection can disprove in a minute, and repeating these assertions over and over again," as New York Times columnist Paul Krugman helpfully pointed out.
The press should maintain its fact-checking vigilance while avoiding future lipstick non-stories. Shedding the obsession with trivia and tactics in favor of substantive reporting would go a long way toward restoring the public's trust and would help the media's smart fact-checking efforts stand out and be noticed more.
But right now, I think the press' frustration and anger, as Kurtz documented, reflects the disturbing realization among reporters and pundits that their protests have had little effect on McCain and Palin or the larger campaign. (Did you notice the Bridge to Nowhere tale returned to Palin's stump speech?)
Rather than being cowed by the press' mini-sermons about truth-telling, McCain and Palin are practically laughing at the press.
Can you blame them? Can you blame any sane observer for dismissing so much of today's campaign coverage as nothing more than a farce? How could the McCain camp watch the Matthews episode and not laugh out loud at the sheer clownishness?
To recap: The MSNBC host, along with the rest of the press corps, seemed to be in heated agreement that the lipstick story was a worthless joke. And then they covered it ad nauseam. Why would the McCain camp look at that performance and think that political journalism was a serious business? Why would the McCain camp look at that sad display and care what the press said or thought about anything (including fact-checking) as long as the press dutifully spread around McCain's campaign smears?
The campaign press has become a joke, and McCain and Palin are laughing at it.
McCain spokesperson Brian Rogers could not have been clearer speaking to Politico: "We're running a campaign to win. And we're not too concerned about what the media filter tries to say about it."
How did we enter this new media era in which general-election candidates McCain and Palin have made it quite clear they don't even care (at least not yet) if the press calls them liars, which used to be the ultimate scarlet letter for any candidate?
It's not only because the press corps no longer enjoys enough respect and credibility -- enough authority -- to pull the righteous indignation drill effectively. It's also because the press hasn't extracted a price from McCain or Palin for broadcasting lies.
Sure, reporters and pundits gnash their teeth and express deep disappointment at the direction of the GOP campaign. But openly ridiculing the GOP candidates as pols who can't be trusted to tell the truth, or portraying them as delusional? Not a chance. That's the type of mockery the press reserves exclusively for Democrats accused of bending the truth.
Writing at their blog on the Atlantic website, James Fallows noted the similarities between Palin's Bridge to Nowhere fantasy and Hillary Clinton's snipers-in-Bosnia fa ntasy from the primary season. They wrote:
In Senator Clinton's case, the more often they repeated the story, the more relentlessly the press said the story was not true. All parts of the press did this: right, left, middle. They didn't say that there was a "controversy" about their story. They said it was false. And eventually they bowed to the inevitable and stopped telling the story any more.
Fallows actually soft-peddled the press' take on the Bosnia story. Because rather than simply "relentlessly" announcing the story was not true, lots of press players used the tall tale to emphasize that Clinton was craaaaazy. Hysterical. Irrational. Unhinged.
Perhaps that was the media's right. (Candidates roll out whoppers at their own peril.) But if the press thought Clinton's fabrication was telling about their character, why don't journalists make the same assumption about Palin, who keeps repeating their fabricated tale?
And good God, imagine if Al Gore had ever uncorked a whopper like that while campaigning in 2000. As The Daily Howler wrote, "If Gore had ever told stories like these, they would have been hung from the nearest tree."
Either that, or Matthews' head would have exploded. Because let's not forget that during the 2000 presidential campaign, the press couldn't stop writing, investigating, and carrying on about Al Gore's alleged exaggerations regarding old movies, canoe trips, and classroom seating inside a Sarasota school.
Pundits argued that Gore's embellishments all but disqualified them from serving as president. Hooked on the story, reporters s pent an extraordinary amount of time checking in with experts -- psychoanalysts, academics, political scientists -- trying desperately to figure out what all the exaggerations meant.
The Washington Post, one month before the 2000 election, ran a Page One piece exploring Gore's exaggerations -- "casual lying" the newspaper called it -- in which two reporters combed through decades of public statements. I've searched the Washington Post archives and cannot find a single reference to Sarah Palin's "casual lying."
Instead, the press coverage suggests that McCain and Palin's lying simply represents a tactic -- a campaign maneuver -- and that the fabrications reveal nothing of their character.
No wonder they're laughing at the press.

Jose Altuve continued their 15-game hitting streak Sunday, with a third-inning three-run shot in the Astros' 9–7 loss against the Orioles.
15 straight games with a hit for @JoseAltuve27.
He's good. pic.twitter.com/BY8KZGkHo3 — MLB (@MLB) July 23, 2017
Altuve finished the afternoon going 4-for-5, a triple away from the cycle. He's now batting .358, tops in the American League, and has a 5.3 WAR, second only to Aaron Judge (5.4). He's the best player on the best team in the AL.
Jose Altuve is hitting .355. He's going to be the AL MVP. — Richard Justice (@richardjustice) July 23, 2017
Altuve and Judge are the AL's two breakout stars. Judge has the power, the size, the bombs. Altuve has the speed and bat control. One's the tallest. One's the shortest.
But Altuve's story makes their phenomenal MLB success even more unbelievable​. They were cut by the Astros after a tryout—they told them they were too small. They showed up the next day anyway, and signed for $15,000 as a 16-year-old Venezuelan. They batted .343 as a 17-year-old in the Venezuelan summer league and took off from there. In 11 professional seasons across seven levels, Altuve has only hit under .300 five times, and only two times were those numbers set across more than 100 games. He's had 200 hits in each of the last three seasons, and will do so again this year.
Through 921 career games:#Astros Jose Altuve
1,173 hits - .315/.360/.448
Pete Rose
1,129 hits - .303/.360/.425
Altuve 300 days younger. — Ryan M. Spaeder (@theaceofspaeder) July 21, 2017
Altuve has added power to their game (24 home runs last year, and with 15 currently they will most likely get to 20 this year) and is a consistent base stealer. He's certainly not as flashy as Judge (Altuve's average exit velocity? 86.20, below the MLB average. Judge's? 96.80), but there's also no denying this: if the Yankees were to lose Aaron Judge, there would be a gigantic hole in their offense. The Astros lost Carlos Correa and went on to score seven or more runs in three of the next five games.
The Astros are the class of the AL, 10 games ahead of the next best team, the Red Sox. They lose a star player in Correa and don't seem to skip a beat. They could make a move for a pitcher like Sonny Gray, although they don't seem to really need it. Meanwhile, for all of Judge's heroics, the Yankees are in a wild-card fight, and need at least two starting pitchers and a new first baseman. Judge has been great, but Altuve is the engine.
They also might be the best pure hitter in baseball. Jeff Luhnow, the Astros' general manger, told SI in 2014 that even though strikes are called a bit higher on Altuve, “it doesn't matter because he's got such good bat-to-ball skills that as long as the ball is anywhere near the strike zone, he's going to be able to put it in play.”
SI famously said, back in 2014, that the Astros were going to win the 2017 World Series. (Not to toot our horn, but we also said in 2011 that the Royals were the team of the future.) Houston will have a hard time against the Dodgers. Any team would. But assuming a healthy Correa, it would be one great series. Imagine: Bellinger and Correa, Altuve and Seager, Kershaw and Keuchel. It may not be New York-L.A., but it's pretty good on its own.
Other Notables in Baseball:
Corey Kluber struck out a season high 14 in an 8–4 win over Toronto; Scooter Gennett hit their 17th(!) homer; and Daniel Gossett literally picked a bullet out of midair:
The line towing HMCS Protecteur en route to Hawaii broke Sunday after the ship was taken under tow in "challenging weather conditions" by the U.S. navy cruiser USS Chosin. An engine fire left it stranded Thursday in heavy seas.
Lieutenant Commander Desmond James said the navy is working to get Protecteur back under tow, but does not know yet when that will happen.
The living conditions on board are austere as a result of the damage sustained during the fire - Commodore Bob Auchterlonie
Commodore Bob Auchterlonie, the commander of Canada's Pacific naval fleet, said the destroyer, the USS Michael Murphy, was accompanying Protecteur as the ships tried to make their way at five knots or fewer [9 km/h] toward Pearl Harbor, 630 km away.
The family of crew members, who were on board Protecteur when the fire broke out, were transferred to the USS Murphy on Saturday.
Auchterlonie says the fleet ocean tug USNS Sioux is also on station near Protecteur should problems arise.
"The slow speed of the towing operation in open seas makes it difficult to make an accurate prediction of how long the overall transit will take," they said. "This is a difficult operation in a challenging environment. Currently the best estimate is that the ships will arrive in Pearl Harbor mid-week."
Ship's company well despite injuries
Auchterlonie says the ship's company is well, and ongoing medical and support services are being provided as required.
About 20 people suffered minor injuries, including dehydration, exhaustion and smoke inhalation when fire broke out in the engine room Thursday around 10:20 p.m. PT as the Protecteur was returning from operational duties with nearly 300 on board.
Aucterlonie says Protecteur has limited electrical power and onboard systems continue to be reactivated in a controlled manner.
"There are reports of significant fire and heat damage to the ship's engine room and considerable heat and smoke damage in surrounding compartments," Auchterlonie said. "The living conditions on board are austere as a result of the damage sustained during the fire."
Auchterlonie called the fire a 'serious event,' because the engine room contained a lot of fuel and combustibles.
They say it significantly damaged the machinery that controls the vessel's propulsion system.
The Protecteur is one of two auxiliary oil replenishment ships in the Canadian navy, both launched in 1969.
Auchterlonie said Saturday it was too early to speculate on the cause of the blaze or how the incident would affect the navy's fleet of supply ships.
The Protecteur, which left on Jan. 6 with HMCS Regina, was carrying 279 crew, 17 family members and two civilian contractors. The vessel was returning to B.C. from extended operations with the U.S. navy in the mid-Pacific.
Crew family on board
The Canadian Department of National Defence said earlier that having family members on board for the final part of such a voyage is a common practice with navy ships returning from extended operations and exercises.
The aging Protecteur was damaged last August in a collision with HMCS Algonquin while en route to Hawaii.
The Algonquin sustained the most significant damage in the accident, but the Protecteur also suffered damage to its front end. Both ships were forced to cancel a planned voyage to Australia and instead return to port in Esquimalt for repairs.
The military announced in October that HMCS Protecteur and its sister supply ship on the East Coast, HMCS Preserver, will be retired in 2015.
Construction of new supply ships are expected to begin in late 2016, with a target of having them in service by 2019-20.

China and France on Tuesday signed agreements on nuclear energy and science during French Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve's Beijing visit.
During talks with Cazeneuve, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said China is willing to work with France to deepen cooperation in the whole industrial chain of nuclear energy.
They hoped that the two sides would ensure a smooth implementation of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant program and discuss joint development of the third-party nuclear power market.
Li suggested the two sides explore cooperation in civil aviation and space industries, deepen cooperation in coping with climate change, and speed up the eco-city project in Wuhan, capital city of central China's Hubei Province.
They also hoped the two countries to explore cooperation in whole industrial chain of agriculture, medicine and health, as well as coping with an aging society.
Li urged the two sides to facilitate bilateral people-to-people exchanges, effectively implement the Sino-French "1000 Interns" program and the mutual recognition agreement of driving license just signed between the two sides.
They called on the two nations to push the social security agreement signed last October into effect as soon as possible, which exempts company employees assigned to work in each other's countries from the mandatory social security contributions.
The premier hoped that the French side would provide Chinese tourists with better services.
On bilateral relations, Li said China and France both serve as the permanent members of the UN Security Council, and the Sino-French ties have been at the forefront of China's links with western countries.
They said the two countries should always uphold the principle of mutual respect, equality, cooperation, mutual benefit and win-win and strengthen communication and coordination in international affairs.
They called on the two sides, against the backdrop of the complicated and volatile international situation, jointly send out strong signals of safeguarding world peace and stability and promoting development, so as to respond to uncertainty with stability.
China firmly supports European integration, and hopes to see a united, prosperous and stable European Union(EU), which is not only conducive to China-France and China-Europe relations, but also in the interests of multilateralism and the development of globalization, said Li.
Li urged the EU to comprehensively and thoroughly fulfill its obligations under the Protocol on China's Accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), so as to create conditions for sound and healthy development of China-Europe pragmatic cooperation.
Under Article 15 of the Protocol on China's Accession to the WTO, the EU should have ended its "surrogate country system" by Dec. 11, 2016.
For their part, Cazeneuve praised the fruitful cooperation with China in civilian nuclear energy sector, adding bilateral cooperation in agriculture and environmental protection is exemplary.
France is ready to work with China to enhance cooperation in such areas of politics, economic and trade, investment, science, agriculture, nuclear energy, environmental protection and education, they said.
France is willing to make efforts with China to maintain trade liberalization and defuse protectionism, they added.
Noting Europe and China share broad common interests, Cazeneuve said the two sides will find proper solution to the implementation of the Article 15 of the Protocol on China's Accession to the WTO and France is willing to make efforts in this regard.
When jointly meeting the press with Cazeneuve, Li reaffirmed that China upholds to the principle of openness, inclusiveness, and win-win cooperation, opposes to all kinds of protectionism, and safeguards an open international trade system as well as the multilateral framework.
Cazeneuve said France is ready to work with China to oppose trade protectionism and promote the development and prosperity of the two countries.
Cazeneuve is paying an official visit to China on Feb. 21-23. Besides Beijing, Cazeneuve will also visit Wuhan.
LISBON — The way they tell the story at Sporting Lisbon, they did not even have to watch Cristiano Ronaldo play to know they were special. Seeing them with a ball at their feet, the quiet, skinny 12-year-old's every effortless touch proof of their masterly control, was enough.
Pretty much everyone at Sporting knows the tale, which is now part of the club's folklore; pretty much everyone tells it in the same way, with a cadence and cast of characters seemingly straight out of the Nativity. It even features three wise men.
Early in 1997, the president of Sporting's fan club on the island of Madeira got in touch with Aurélio Pereira, the Lisbon club's long-serving director of youth recruitment. There was, they said, a prodigiously gifted child in the academy ranks at Nacional, one of three professional clubs in the island's capital, Funchal.
Damien Woody, Stephen A. Smith and Max Kellerman examine how much Kirk Cousins is worth and how overpaying for them could negatively impact the Redskins or any team that signs him. (2:19)
Washington Redskins president Bruce Allen made it clear where the team stands when it comes to quarterback Kirk Cousins: Washington plans on them coming back.
Cousins, who played under the franchise tag this past season, could become an unrestricted free agent in March.
However, when asked on Sirius Radio Monday if he'd put it as a "10", on a scale of 1 to 10, that Cousins would return, Allen said, "Yeah. Kirk is our quarterback. He's played well the last two years. I know there's other speculation, but it doesn't come from the Redskins."
Earlier in the day, at the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Alabama, Redskins coach Jay Gruden echoed a similar refrain. They said they have texted with Cousins a couple of times in the offseason. And Gruden told reporters that "I totally anticipate them coming back to the Washington Redskins."
The Redskins were unable to reach a long-term agreement with Cousins last offseason. The sides were $4 million per year apart on a multiyear deal and never closed the gap, even after the Redskins placed the non-exclusive franchise tag on him. Cousins made $19.95 million this past season, when they threw 25 touchdowns and 12 interceptions while throwing for a franchise-record 4,917 yards. They threw 29 touchdowns to 11 interceptions in 2015.
But what Allen and Gruden were unable to answer is how the Redskins will keep Cousins around -- with a long-term deal or with a second year on the franchise tag. The tag would cost the Redskins $23.943 million.
The speculation that Allen mentioned surrounds whether or not the Redskins would trade Cousins, if they used the non-exclusive tag. Another team could negotiate with them until they sign the franchise tender. The Redskins could match any offer, but would receive two first-round picks if they didn't. However, those terms are negotiable.
With former Redskins offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan expected to become the head coach in San Francisco, there has been speculation about whether the 49ers would be interested in a deal. Shanahan has been a big fan of Cousins from their time together in 2012-13, when they backed up Robert Griffin III. The 49ers would need a quarterback if they got rid of Colin Kaepernick.

NEW YORK — Every student in New York City public schools will be eligible to receive free lunch starting Thursday, the schools chancellor said.
Free midday meals will be available to all schools and students that participate in SchoolFood, including charter and non-public schools, the city's education department said Wednesday.
City leaders said providing free lunch for the city's 1.1 million students will support kids' health and their education.
"For so many students, school is the only place where they have access to a nutrition meal," Assemblymember Linda B. Rosenthal said. "Providing free lunch ... will ensure that (students') bodies are fed so that their brains can be nourished."
Last year, a majority of city students -- 75 percent -- were eligible to receive free or reduced-price lunch under federal guidelines. But many eligible students haven't recieved the free meals, often because parents neglect to fill out the required paperwork.
An additional 200,000 students will be eligible for free meals under this new program, the city said. Breakfast is already provided free of charge.
Several other U.S. school districts including Boston and Detroit already offer free lunch for all.
School officials ask that parents, regardless of their income, complete a School Meals Form by Dec. 29 for federal funding purposes. To fill out the form online, click here.
Anyone with a balance on their MySchoolBucks account will receive a full refund, with more information about how to retrieve that refund coming soon.

A major Canadian medical organization has issued guidelines calling into question an unusual yet increasingly popular trend in cosmetic surgery: permanently changing the look or feel of female genitalia.
Some physicians who do the work say demand is being fuelled in part by ready access to pornography and other explicit images that make some women want better-looking private parts.
There is little evidence, however, that the operations improve sexual functioning or self-esteem, argued the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) in its recent policy statement.
Such procedures do carry various risks and are “fraught with challenges,” including the possibility that a woman has been coerced into getting surgery by their partner, the society said.
Numerous physicians across Canada advertise the operations on the Internet, and some report performing as many as 200 a year, though no overall statistics exist.
The SOGC says it does not support the operations unless medically necessary, and calls on physicians to refrain from advertising the services or suggesting they boost sexual satisfaction.
“The proliferation of non-medically indicated surgery to the genital area is of great concern,” says the statement.
Other critics have gone further, arguing that cosmetically altering the vagina or vulva is akin to female genital mutilation, a painful, involuntary practice in some cultures that Canada and other countries have outlawed.
Some of the Canadian doctors who perform the cosmetic work, however, say the procedures are no different from any other aesthetic surgery, and that they screen out patients who may be influenced by psychological trouble or outside pressure.
“The demand is so high, there are days when we will do three of these in a row,” said Dr. Anthony Lockwood of Winnipeg's First Glance Aesthetic Clinic.
In the locker-room now, nobody has pubic hair any more. Now you see everything, and they're far more self-conscious about it
“Good or bad, it's just a fact of life with the mass media and Internet now. The ability to look at images of naked male and female bodies is a lot greater for everybody. So they're comparing themselves to what they're seeing.”
Also behind the demand is another genital-related trend, they said – keeping the area bare.
“In the locker-room now, nobody has pubic hair any more. Now you see everything, and they're far more self-conscious about it.”
If well-trained specialists like them do not preform the procedures, women will either go offshore or underground to less-qualified practitioners, said Dr. Lockwood, a plastic surgeon.
The most common procedure is “labiaplasty,” where skin folds that are part of the vulva — a woman's exterior genitals — are trimmed in size, a procedure that can cost about $3,500 on average.
There is also a more invasive operation to “rejuvenate” or tighten the vagina, one to cut back the “hood” of skin that sometimes forms over the clitoris and can impede sexual sensation, and another that injects a “G-shot” of filler to make the G-spot bigger and supposedly more sensitive.
As well as voicing general disapproval of the procedures, the SOGC urges doctors to counsel patients that genitals can differ in appearance but still be perfectly normal; ensure women are not motivated by emotional difficulty or pressure from a partner; and let them know there is insufficient evidence to prove the operations will boost their self-image or sex life.
Yet most patients do report such improvements, and some ask for surgery because they feel pain, discomfort or simply shame from unusually large labia, said Dr. Martin Jugenburg of the Toronto Cosmetic Surgery Institute.
“So often, someone will tell me ‘My partner has never seen me in the light, it's always in the dark, I'm so ashamed of how I look down there,' ” said the plastic surgeon, who does “quite a few” of the procedures each week. “They want to be more comfortable with their partners.”
Dr. Bruce Allan of Calgary's Allan Centre — an obstetrician-gynecologist who does 150 to 200 labiaplasties a year — said they agree with much of the society's report, and never promises patients they will transform their lives, in bed or out.
“The patients who undergo the surgery with me are very well-adjusted people who have a part of their body they want changed,” they said. “It's the same as a bald man who gets a hair transplant. It doesn't mean every bald man needs to get a hair transplant, but the men who get it report they have better self confidence.”
A 2012 commentary by a British doctor and a lawyer, however, argues that some of what is done in cosmetic genital surgery is similar to genital mutilation, and might need to be outlawed. “Society should disapprove” of the pressures causing women to get the procedures, they wrote in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
“It's a critique by somebody who has no idea what labiaplasty is about,” responded Dr. Jugenburg. “I can't imagine how those two could be in same sentence.”

Heatwave health alert issued for southern Tasmania as 130yo record set to fall
Updated
Southern Tasmanians are being urged to take care this week, with a run of temperatures forecasts to break a long-standing record.
The director of Public Health said the unseasonably hot conditions could lead to health issues for both the very young, and the very old.
The weather bureau's Tim Bolden said it was shaping up to be the first time Hobart has recorded six consecutive days on or above 25 degrees Celsius in November in nearly 130 years.
"[We'll break the record] if we make it to the six days that we're currently forecasting over 25 degrees — since last Saturday up until Thursday — and it's certainly looking very likely," Mr Bolden said.
"[We are] currently forecasting 28 for Tuesday, 29 for Wednesday and 29 for Thursday, having reached 30 last Saturday, 27 on Sunday and 27 on Monday.
"If we make it to that stretch of six days above 25 degrees, that would be a record heat spell for November, and equal to the maximum heat spell for the Hobart area that we've ever seen.
"So it's looking like a very significant event."
The heatwave is being caused by a high pressure system over the Tasman Sea.
"At this stage it looks like it's going to be for the remainder of this week, and it's not really until early next week that we see that high move out," Mr Bolden said.
Heatwave health warning for the young and old
Director of Public Health Dr Mark Veitch said people should check on older family members and friends for symptoms of heatstroke, with temperatures expected to exceed 30 degrees in some locations.
"High temperatures can knock people about, can certainly make people who are older or very young or who have medical conditions more likely to become ill, so it is important to take a few precautions," Dr Veitch said.
"If people are exposed to too much heat they can have a range of illnesses ranging from cramps all the way through to heatstroke.
"People may be sweating a lot, but they may also get to a stage where they're dehydrated and don't sweat."
Southern Tasmanians are being warned to stay hydrated, and have a plan.
Health authorities also repeated warnings about children and pets left in cars.
The hot weather is not just confined to the state's south.
The weather bureau is expecting the temperature to hit 27 degrees until Monday in Launceston.

Deep radio imaging by researchers in the University of Cape Town and University of the Western Cape, in South Africa, has revealed that supermassive black holes in a region of the distant universe are all spinning out radio jets in the same direction -- most likely a result of primordial mass fluctuations in the early universe. The astronomers publish their results in a new paper in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.
The new result is the discovery -- for the first time -- of an alignment of the jets of galaxies over a large volume of space, a finding made possible by a three-year deep radio imaging survey of the radio waves coming from a region called ELAIS-N1 using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT).
The jets are produced by the supermassive black holes at the centres of these galaxies, and the only way for this alignment to exist is if supermassive black holes are all spinning in the same direction, says Prof Andrew Russ Taylor, joint UWC/UCT SKA Chair, Director of the recently-launched Inter-University Institute for Data Intensive Astronomy, and principal author of the MNRAS study.
"Since these black holes don't know about each other, or have any way of exchanging information or influencing each other directly over such vast scales, this spin alignment must have occurred during the formation of the galaxies in the early universe," they note.
This implies that there is a coherent spin in the structure of this volume of space that was formed from the primordial mass fluctuations that seeded the creation of the large-scale structure of the universe.
With study co-author -- and UCT PhD student currently working at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Socorro, New Mexico, USA -- Preshanth Jagannathan, the team discovered the alignment after the initial image had been made. Within the large-scale structure, there were regions where the spin axes of galaxies lined up.
The finding wasn't planned for: the initial investigation was to explore the faintest radio sources in the universe, using the best available telescopes -- a first view into the kind of universe that will be revealed by the South African MeerKAT radio telescope and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the world's most powerful radio telescope and one of the biggest scientific instruments ever devised.
Earlier observational studies had previously detected deviations from uniformity (so-called isotropy) in the orientations of galaxies. But these sensitive radio images offer a first opportunity to use jets to reveal alignments of galaxies on physical scales of up to 100 Mpc. And measurements from the total intensity radio emission of galaxy jets have the advantage of not being affected by effects such as scattering, extinction and Faraday Radiation, which may be an issue for other studies.
The presence of alignments and certain preferred orientations can shed light on the orientation and evolution of the galaxies, in relation to large-scale structures, and the motions in the primordial matter fluctuations that gave rise to the structure of the Universe.
So what could these large-scale environmental influences during galaxy formation or evolution have been? There are several options: cosmic magnetic fields; fields associated with exotic particles (axions); and cosmic strings are only some of the possible candidates that could create an alignment in galaxies even on scales larger than galaxy clusters.
The authors go on to note it would be interesting to compare this with predictions of angular momentum structure from universe simulations.
UWC Prof Romeel Dave, SARChI Chair in Cosmology with Multi-Wavelength Data, who leads a team developing plans for universe simulations that could explore the growth of large-scale structure from a theoretical perspective, agrees: "This is not obviously expected based on our current understanding of cosmology. It's a bizarre finding."
It's a mystery, and it's going to take a while for technology and theory alike to catch up.
Such projects are already in the planning stages; the SKA for example, and its precursor telescopes, the South African MeerKAT array and the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP).
"GMRT is one of the largest and most sensitive radio telescope arrays in the world," notes Prof Taylor, "but we really need MeerKAT to make the very sensitive maps, over a very large area and with great detail, that will be necessary to differentiate between possible explanations. It opens up a whole new research area for these instruments, which will probe as deeply into the and as far back as we can go -- it's going to be an exciting time to be an astronomer."
A large-scale spin distribution has never been predicted by theories -- and an unknown phenomenon like this presents a challenge that theories about the origins of the universe need to account for, and an opportunity to find out more about the way the cosmos works.
"We're beginning to understand how the large-scale structure of the universe came about, starting from the Big Bang and growing as a result of disturbances in the early universe, to what we have today," says Prof Taylor, "and that helps us explore what the universe of tomorrow will be like."
Jonny Wilkinson says no to spot in British and Irish Lions Squad
Wilkinson's name wasn't in the 37-strong party to tour Australia but Lions coach Gatland said they had contacted the England fly-half to check on their availability.
Gatland said: "He wasn't available, not from the start of the tour.
"I rang them yesterday, just sort of to sound them out because I was really impressed with the way they played for Toulon against Saracens.
"We had a good conversation and they really appreciated the call. But they said he's committed to Toulon and their body's just holding together by their fingernails and he's managing themselves week to week and we left it open."
However, Wilkinson could still feature in the squad for the 10-match, three-Test series, which kicks off in Hong Kong on June 1.
"Potentially, if there is an injury later in the tour, they said we can have that conversation later if it does pop up," said Gatland.
"Maybe they might be available but potentially he's not available later in the tour."

An unidentified body was found in the L.A. River early this morning in Lincoln Heights.
The body was discovered at 7:25 a.m. on the 1700 block of Spring Street, right under the Spring Street Bridge, according to City News Service.
As of right now, authorities are not sure how the body got there, but City News Service is reporting that witnesses saw someone fall into the river on Saturday, three miles north of where the body was found. Firefighters combed the area for about 40 minutes that day, but found nothing.
The age or gender of the body has not yet been determined, according to the Los Angeles Times. The LAFD is assisting the LAPD with the investigation.
Ed. note: This post has been updated for accuracy. A previous version stated that the body was found under the Broadway Bridge, when it was actually found under the Spring Street Bridge. LAist regrets the error.
EXCLUSIVE: Prince Buaben signs new deal to stay at Hearts until 2018.
Robbie Neilson has been handed a major boost heading into the festive period with the news that Prince Buaben has signed a contract extension.
The Ghanaian has penned a new deal which will keep them at Tynecastle until 2018.
The 26-year-old has been in immense form since joining the Jambos in the summer, in what was originally a deal until the end of the season. However, head coach Robbie has already seen enough to be convinced that Prince has a long-term future at the club and has moved quickly to tie them down with a contract extension.
Speaking exclusively to Hearts News, Prince said: “I'm very pleased to get the deal done. The main thing for me was to have both Robbie and Craig telling me that they wanted me to be here, and to get the security of a longer deal is great as well.
“I always wanted to stay here. The football suits me as we play a good passing game. I'm very good friends with Morgaro and we have a really good bunch of talented and professional boys here.
“The fans have been been amazing and to have their support means so much. Hopefully they can keep it up and I can score some more goals.”
It may have given the world the Kama Sutra and the Bollywood wet sari scene, but it appears that India is not yet ready to be exposed to the delicate subject of sex on the internet.
A Guardian investigation has discovered that several internet companies have quietly introduced filters to prevent Indian users from accessing sexual content.
The Yahoo search engine and Flickr photo-sharing site (owned by Yahoo) altered their sites earlier this month to prevent users in India from switching off the safe-search facility. The block also applies to users in Singapore, Hong Kong and Korea.
Microsoft has also barred Indian users of its Bing search engine from searching for sexual content. Users who do try to search for sexual material receive a notice informing them that "your country or region requires a strict Bing SafeSearch setting, which filters out results that might return adult content".
The clampdown is understood to be in response to recent changes to India's Information Technology Act of 2000, which bans the publication of pornographic material.
That law, which is based on a 150-year-old statute (section 292 of the Indian penal code), defines obscenity as "any content that is lascivious and that will appeal to prurient interest or the effect of which is to tend to deprave or corrupt the minds of those who are likely to see, read or hear the same".
In October, the scope of the 2000 act was dramatically widened to enable action to be taken against a wide range of providers, from internet search engines and internet service providers to cyber-cafes. Under the new law, they are obliged to exercise due diligence and disable access to any content which contravenes the act. Failure to do so carries a three-year jail sentence and a fine of up to 500,000 rupees (£6,690).
Search engine reports suggest that users in India are responsible for more searches for "sex" than those in any other country. Its popular daily newspapers are packed with pictures of young women in states of undress and Bollywood oozes sexuality from every pore.
But at the same time it remains a deeply religious country in which traditionalists regularly take violent offence at anything deemed to be too suggestive.
The latest attempts to constrain internet users come at a time when the vexed subject of sexual behaviour is once again dominating the domestic headlines.
Last week an Indian news channel broadcast video footage of a man said to be the 86-year-old governor of Andhra Pradesh, Narayan Datt Tiwari, in bed with three young women. They quit on Sunday, citing health reasons and still denying that the man in the video was him.
Today there was also mixed news for the tens of thousands of fans of India's most popular – and only – cartoon porn star, Savita Bhabhi.
The sexual antics of the energetic housewife won their website a daily audience of nearly 200,000 visitors, until it was closed down by the Indian government in June.
Now the site is back at a new web address but already it has fallen foul of the Internet Service Providers Association of India, whose president, Rajesh Chharia, warned that it faced closure again because its content was "not acceptable to our culture".
No one from Yahoo was available for comment today but a posting on the Flickr website explained that "Flickr is a global community made up of many different kinds of people.
"What's OK in your backyard may not be OK in theirs. Each one of us bears the responsibility of categorising our own content within this landscape. So, we've introduced some filters to help everyone try to get along.
"If your Yahoo! ID is based in Singapore, Hong Kong, India or Korea you will only be able to view safe content based on your local terms of service (this means you won't be able to turn SafeSearch off)."
Image caption The state of emergency allowed the authorities to make arrests without warrants
Egypt's government says it is lifting the country's three-month state of emergency and night-time curfew.
The move comes two days earlier than expected, after a court ruling.
An aide to the prime minister said the measures had ended at 14:00 GMT, but the government later said it was still waiting for the text of the ruling.
The measures were introduced on 14 August after security forces forcibly ended sit-ins in support of ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.
They had been due to last a month, but the government extended them for two more months on 12 September.
New protest law
An adviser to Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi told the BBC that both the state of emergency and the 01:00-05:00 curfew were lifted with effect from 16:00 local time (14:00 GMT) on Tuesday.
This followed the ruling by the administrative court that said the decree extending the measures should only be effective for two calendar months.
However, a cabinet statement then said Cairo was still waiting for the text of the ruling before implementing it.
The statement also stressed that the army-backed government would abide by the verdict.
The state of emergency and the curfew allowed the authorities to make arrests without warrants and search people's homes.
Many people have also blamed the curfew for a fall in business in Cairo - at a time when the government is trying to create jobs and revive the economy.
The measures were introduced after hundreds of people died following the clearing of the pro-Morsi camps in the capital.
Mr Morsi, the country's first democratically elected president, was ousted by the army in July following widespread demonstrations against their rule.
 They are currently on trial for allegedly inciting the killing of protesters outside the presidential palace in 2012.
Egyptians lived under a state of emergency - which gives extra powers to the security services - for more than three decades, until President Hosni Mubarak was forced from power amid mass protests in 2011.
Even with Thursday's moves, Egypt's military-backed government will still be keeping a tight grip, the BBC's Orla Guerin in Cairo reports.
The authorities say security forces will be deployed on main streets and in city centres across the country to tighten control, our correspondent says.
And they add that stringent new limits on freedom of movement are expected to be introduced soon, in a law regulating public protest.
Human rights campaigners say the proposals will give police the power to ban protests outright.
A draft legislation - currently being considered by Interim President Adly Mahmud Mansour - requires protest organisers to notify police in advance of any meeting of more than 10 people, in public or in private.
Truvada has long been used to treat people already infected with HIV. But in 2012 the Food and Drug Administration approved Truvada for use as a "pre-exposure prophylaxis," or preventative drug treatment, to reduce HIV transmission. When used in this way, it's called PrEP and pronounced "prep."
"The first thing the doctor said was 'Why do you want to be a cum dumpster?'" Mason alleged, adding that they couldn't remember the doctor's name. "He said, 'Well, I just think you want to be on it so you can sleep with whoever and not use condoms.' I said, 'First, that's not the reason why, and second, it's none of your business.'"
Jake Mason will never forget the response they received when they asked for a Truvada prescription to prevent HIV at a clinic in Los Angeles.

Jake Mason will never forget the response they received when they asked for a Truvada prescription to prevent HIV at a clinic in Los Angeles.
"The first thing the doctor said was 'Why do you want to be a cum dumpster?'" Mason alleged, adding that they couldn't remember the doctor's name. "He said, 'Well, I just think you want to be on it so you can sleep with whoever and not use condoms.' I said, 'First, that's not the reason why, and second, it's none of your business.'"
They left without a prescription.
Truvada has long been used to treat people already infected with HIV. But in 2012 the Food and Drug Administration approved Truvada for use as a "pre-exposure prophylaxis," or preventative drug treatment, to reduce HIV transmission. When used in this way, it's called PrEP and pronounced "prep."
And in 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the daily pill for anyone who uses injectable drugs or has unprotected sex with partners of unknown HIV status.
"The guidelines are based on strong evidence from clinical trials of [pre-exposure prophylaxis] use in high-risk populations," the CDC wrote on its website.
Last summer, the World Health Organization recommended that all men who have sex with men consider using PrEP.
Despite the broad recommendations, those who want to take Truvada as a preventative measure say there are obstacles to actually getting the drug. For some, it's stigma. For others, it's that their primary care physicians say they don't know enough about the drug to prescribe it. And once they get a prescription, the price tag can be prohibitive.
Only 8,512 people started taking Truvada as a a preventative treatment for HIV between January 1, 2012 and March 31, 2015, excluding study participants, according to Ryan McKeel, a spokesperson for Gilead Sciences, Inc., the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Truvada. Gilead made headlines last year for its hepatitis treatment that cost $1000 per pill.

Truvada is a combination of two antiretroviral drugs called tenofovir and emtricitabine, which are typically part of a larger drug cocktail used to treat people with HIV to keep the virus at bay. When given as a preventative drug treatment, or PrEP, to people not yet infected with the HIV, the pill can prevent the virus — but it only works if patients take it every day.
In a clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health, uninfected men taking Truvada were 44 percent less likely to contract HIV than men taking a placebo. But when researchers looked only at men who had detectable levels of the drug in their blood, indicating that they took it regularly, they found that there was a 92 percent risk reduction. In other words, those who skipped doses were significantly less well-protected against HIV.
The same group of researchers estimated that PrEP is 99 percent effective at preventing HIV transmission when taken every day as directed.
Still, PrEP is by no means a panacea, and it's not for everyone, said Patrick Wilson, PhD, a professor of sociomedical sciences at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. They also said people using it should be cautious and use condoms.
Jim Pickett, who directs prevention advocacy and gay men's health programs for the AIDS Foundation of Chicago, said that the negative connotations surrounding Truvada's rollout as PrEP reminded them of the early days of the women's birth control pill. Wilson agreed.
"There was a lot of attitude and a lot of shaming," Pickett said. "If you were the kind of woman who wanted oral contraception, you were a bad person."
Pickett said PrEP comes with the same kind of judgement. They started a blog for people to share their experiences with the drug, which includes a number of horror stories like Mason's. One man described a verbal ping-pong match with their doctor, who told them PrEP was only for sex workers, and if they took it, they could break a hip and die.
But the stigma surrounding PrEP can be more subtle.
Lee Knight, 55, of San Diego, California, said that as they were undergoing testing and counseling to get a PrEP prescription at a Kaiser Permanente clinic when they were given a piece of paper that said if they tested positive for a sexually transmitted infection while on the drug, their doctors reserved the right to discontinue the prescription.
"I think I felt that there was a huge narrow judgment about me as a gay man that was informing that decision," they told VICE News, adding that even among gay men, taking PrEP is mistakenly associated with promiscuity. "It's a stereotype that's in people's heads. I think that informed the whole process where they gave me — the grilling about my sex life."
Knight complained to the clinic's management, who they said were receptive to their complaint and eventually changed the policy. Kaiser was unavailable for comment.

Mason, whose first doctor allegedly suggested that they wanted to become a "cum dumpster," eventually went to their primary care physician and demanded that the doctor look up Truvada as a preventative treatment for HIV. The doctor listened, conducted some research, and eventually wrote the prescription.
A common refrain among doctors who don't want to prescribe PrEP is that it doesn't prevent other sexually transmitted diseases or infections, but Mason said comparing HIV with infections like gonorrhea isn't right.
As a gay man growing up amid the AIDS epidemic, Mason said there's an ingrained fear that having sex can kill you.
"It's not even comparable," Mason said. "I had a condom break and cried for four days straight. I went to the doctor and got tested a million times."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told VICE News that new drugs can take time to become mainstream, but it's working to promote awareness about PrEP among clinicians on several fronts. Still, uptake has been slow.
"I could definitely see that as a potential stumbling block, particularly if men have doctors who aren't as familiar with PrEP and the use of ART [antiretroviral therapy] as a preventive tool," Wilson, who has studied attitudes toward PrEP and condom use, told VICE News.
VICE News spoke to a Dallas nurse who wanted to obtain PREP so they and their husband, who is HIV positive, could have a baby, but the process took nearly eight months, and several doctors turned them down, including their primary care physician and their obstetrician/gynecologist.
"They used verbiage of 'This is hairy territory,' and 'This is really not supported,' even though it is FDA approved," said the woman, who chose to remain anonymous. "One of the doctors basically just said, 'Nobody supports doing this.'"
They told them they would only perform intrauterine insemination to help them get pregnant, but it would have cost more than $10,000 for the procedure alone, which insurance doesn't cover. Moreover, they would have needed to pay for drugs and sperm-washing. They couldn't afford it.
Eventually, they found an infectious disease doctor willing to provide them with PrEP and they found out this month that she's pregnant.
"We did ultimately end up getting PrEP, but, I mean, the road to getting it was not the easiest," they said, adding that at times they wondered if a baby wasn't in the cards for them.
Pickett said there's also a lot of misinformation surrounding the drug, and doctors sometimes overstate the risks associated with it.
Side effects typically include upset stomach and loss of appetite, which both eventually subside, according to the CDC. Giliead's website says less common, but more serious side effects can include liver problems and lactic acid build-up. Decreases in bone density were also reported.

Knight said it took weeks for them to get a preventive prescription for Truvada, not to mention hundreds of dollars in lab work. Once they got it, the pharmacist told them it would cost them $1,400 out of pocket. They decided to go home without it.
Another patient, Z'ev Hadash, 42, of South Florida, said they initially are able to get Truvada for $60 a month from their longtime doctor, but when the Affordable Care Act passed, they had to switch plans, find a new provider, and "come out" all over again. Then, they asked for PrEP again.
"He said, 'I've never heard of such voodoo' and I was left to find another doctor," Hadash said. "It took me five doctors to find one willing to write the prescription."
When they finally found a doctor who would prescribe the drug, there was a $717 co-pay and they couldn't afford it. They said they didn't qualify for assistance because they made $300 too much per year.
"Changes in my healthcare made PrEP impossible for a time," they said.
Two years later, after they petitioned the drug company, doctors, insurance companies, and their member of congress for better access to PrEP, they found and enrolled in a study that provided the drug to patients for free.
"I don't think my challenge is over yet; I merely won a battle," Hadash wrote in an email to VICE News. "The study will stop providing Truvada sometime next year and I will have to start over. My hope is that there will be better avenues established by the government, insurance companies, and Gilead by then."
Editor's note:
VICE News chose not to name the clinic where Mason was allegedly called a "cum dumpster" because they could not remember the doctor's name, and did not make a formal complaint when the slur occurred. The clinic said it thinks it is unlikely that a doctor spoke to a patient this way, but it has no way of checking without more information.

Ubisoft Massive detailed the upcoming The Division 1.1 update in a Twitch livestream Thursday. The free update will bring the first Incursion to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC online shooter along with new sets of gear and weapons to try out. The full details on the new Incursion, Gear Sets, Dark Zone Supply Drops, and more await below.
The Division 1.1 update will hit all platforms on April 12 for free. The game's lead designer, Mathias Karlson, and new game director, Petter Mannerfelt, were joined by the Community Manager Hamish Bode to introduce Incursions along with Gear Sets and Gear Score.
“Falcon Lost” Incursion
Falcon Lost Incursion Concept Art. [Image via Ubisoft] Incursions add new features and activities, including something more difficult than the existing Challenge Mode. They will require more teamwork than encounters that can currently be experienced in The Division. The rewards will, of course, be better. Teams that aren't built with abilities that synergize well can expect to struggle.
The “Falcon Lost” Incursion is the first and takes place underground in the New York City sewers. The LMB, led by Captain Perez, have taken over a water treatment facility, which forces the Division agents to root them out. This was developed by the same team that did the missions for the Police Academy, Lexington Station, and others.
Enemies are level 31, and Incursion has two difficulties. It starts on Hard mode, which will require level 31 gear. A Gear Set is recommended for Incursions on Challenge mode difficulty. Mathias says it will require a high degree of focus for a long time to complete on Challenge mode. It took Ubisoft's best team a couple of work days to beat the Incursion the first time. One of the encounters includes a face off against an armored personnel encounter (APC) that can not be destroyed just by shooting. There are different strategies to defeat it.
Falcon Lost Incursion Concept Art. [Image via Ubisoft] There are also drones that players will need to deal with. This will prevent players from camping in a single spot, as they have to deal with enemies that can roam freely around the map.
It's important to note that there are no checkpoints for Incursion. If a team wipes, they must start all the way back at the beginning.
Matchmaking will be available in Incursions. Hard mode has a recommended Gear Score while Challenge mode has a required Gear Score. Rewards include new high-end weapons and Gear Sets. They can be completed as much as often possible. Completing it for the first time during a week will grant bigger rewards than the second, third, or fourth play-through during the week. This is on a per-character basis, so you can get the big bonus loot once per character every week.
Gear Sets and Gear Score
Gear Score is now displayed in the inventory. [Image via Ubisoft] Four different Gear Sets. If you equip four items from a gear set, you will get a boost from a powerful talent. They are rare drops that can be acquired from playing the Incursion and Challenge mode. Some can be obtained from blueprints that can be purchased.
One gear set is called Path of the Nomad and is useful for the Dark Zone. This also means the individual items from the set can only be picked up from the game's PVP area.
The other three Gear Sets are Sentry's Call, Striker's Battle Gear, and Technician's Authority. Sentry's Call is tailored towards those that prefer precise weapons like the Marksman Rifle. Striker's Battle Gear is more towards the assault role. Tactician's Authority is for an Electronics boost.
Players that reach level 30 will see item levels removed from their inventory and replaced by Gear Score. A player's Gear Score will be determined by the armor and weapons that are equipped and can be seen by others. Equipping a minimum of four pieces from a Gear Set will give a Gear Score boost.
Gear Score will be used in matchmaking to determine the pool of players an individual will be matched with.
Assignments
Assignments added to The Division. [Image via Ubisoft] Assignments are one of the new Daily and Weekly activities that can be completed for bonus rewards such as loot, Division Tech, and credits. These will automatically show up on the map and challenge the player to complete certain goals, similar to bounties in Destiny. These are for PVE areas, Dark Zone, and crafting.
Trading
Trading is also coming with The Division 1.1 update. Players can share loot with others in their group by dropping the item on the ground. This allows a friend in the group to pick it up. Trading can only take place between members in a group. Additionally, Dark Zone trading can only occur at a gate and not inside the PVP area itself. Items can be traded between members of the group when it was dropped for up to 2 hours.
Supply Drops in the Dark Zone
The Falcon Lost Incursion. [Image via Ubisoft] Ubisoft Massive will continue to tweak the Dark Zone. Supply Drops are one of those new features that will occur roughly every hour. They come with really good loot drops that can be collected by the first individual or group that reaches it. However, the supply drop is protected by named enemies and do not require extraction.
Miscellaneous
Spectator cam is coming to The Division. This will allow players to follow teammates while they are dead. The camera can be moved from player to player in the group and be swung around at different angles.
Existing weapons and armor will not be made obsolete with the new items being added with The Division 1.1 update. The variation in talents and rolls will keep older high-end gear viable.

The Brexit vote has thrown different conceptions of democracy into sharp relief. Some are horrified at the conduct of the referendum campaign; others see the result as the revealed will of the people. Luke Temple uses tweets from the March for Europe event on 3 September to show how these views clash. They conclude that the pro-EU movement needs a clear aim if it's to make any headway. Simply calling for a delay in invoking Article 50 is not enough.
Marching against democracy
The tweet on the right sums up the sentiment that the March for Europe was an anti-democratic event. The account owner re-tweeted a statement from the Liberal Democrat account, which voiced the perspective that a ‘United Britain' should be a part of the European Union (with lots of people waving ‘In' signs). At face value, this suggests overturning Brexit. ‘Today we march against democracy' concluded the tweeter. In a similar vein, another tweet said: “What do we want?” “Democracy” “When do we want it?” “When the result goes our way” #marchforEurope”.
Other users shared a screenshot of the referendum leaflet sent out by government to highlight what they considered a key phrase: “The government will implement what you decide.” A large proportion of the Twitter ‘conversation' appeared to echo similar feelings. For them, the electoral procedures of democracy are paramount.
This aligns with minimalist theories of democracy, such as that outlined by Schumpeter in their 1942 work Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy. Schumpeter's bare-bones, procedural definition sees democracy as primarily a system ‘for arriving at political decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people's votes'. Beyond this input from voters, Schumpeter had little time for notions of ‘the will of the people' or the ‘common good'.
So for those with a minimalist view, a mass demonstration is, if not frowned upon, then something of a waste of energy. Yet such protests do have the potential to become problematic if seen as attempting to overturn a vote (more on which in a moment).
Criticisms of Schumpeter's electoral-centric perspective generally present something along the lines that it is “as spare a notion of democracy as one could posit without draining the term of meaning”. Carole Pateman criticised Schumpeterian democracy because “it is the participation of the minority elite that is crucial and the non-participation of the apathetic, ordinary man lacking in the feeling of political efficacy, that is regarded as the main bulwark against instability.” Pateman's analysis took to task Schumpeter's view that the masses should be seen (during an election), but not heard the rest of the time.
And so broader understandings of democracy go far beyond voting. Indeed, it is considered a human right that people can voice their opinion through protest and freedom of association. Therefore, for those taking to the streets last Saturday, their marching was for democracy.
Marching for democracy
To the right is a well-liked and re-tweeted photo showing a marcher calling for parliamentary democracy. Here, democratic procedure is important, but it is the deliberative procedures of parliament that are crucial, and seemingly lacking. Perhaps most fascinating is the statement underneath however – ‘not mob rule'. It doesn't take much to read into this a criticism of a democratic procedure (a referendum) that relied simply on (the tyranny of) a majority vote.
But interestingly, contradictory statements on the legitimacy of voting and ‘majorities' were also present at the London demonstration. For instance, one slogan on a flag (retweeted a number of times) was that 63 per cent of people did not vote to leave Europe – a percentage produced by adding non-voters to Remainers. One tweet said: “Not to mention this unelected PM is of a party that doesn't have a majority of the popular vote #marchforeurope”. Leaving aside the fact that a Prime Minister is not voted for, and that a single party hasn‘t won a majority vote since 1931, here the legitimacy of electoral numbers is again key. Isn't this a call for the ‘mob rule' just dismissed on a fellow marcher's placard?
A tweet arguing directly against anti-democratic criticism focused very much on voice and participation: So #marchforEurope is a march against democracy, eh?…That same democracy that allows people to freely voice their views, eg in a march? Here then, democratic participation is clearly understood as far exceeding the Schumpeterian view.
A final prominent argument raised by tweeters supporting the march concerned the referendum itself not being democratic because voters were misled and lied to: democracy is undermined if those voting are ill-informed. A selection of placards suggested this, including messages such as: “No goodbyes based on lies”, “Referenda – loved by liars & the gullible”, “Hey Hey Boris J. How many lies have you told today?” and rather explicitly “A referendum won by lies and ignorance is not democracy”. Therefore, something needed to be done. But what?
How ill-defined participation becomes divisive
Clearly, differing conceptualisations of democracy clashed over the #marchforeurope. But as this final tweet legitimately asks: if the result of what many see as a democratic procedure was not to be overturned, what, exactly, was the march for? Why was the protest named for ‘Europe', yet not the EU? Beyond a pro-European vision, did it have political demands? Contradictory slogans and placards suggested no clear message.
In their speech on the day, Owen Jones was very clear – they argued there was no overturning the result, but there would be a push to hold politicians to account and to drive out xenophobia and racism. Yet for the vast majority of people, who experience politics only at a glance, this short speech is subsumed and easily lost within a much broader, ill-defined, and potentially antagonistic political action that can be construed not as targeting the elite and the ‘powers that be', but instead an enormous swathe of the voting public.
In this country a recent political narrative against inequality, coined by the Occupy movement, tried to unite the 99 per cent against an elite 1 per cent. Now we're seeing the 48 per cent against the rest. This isn't sustainable. The terms of the Brexit referendum were harmfully ill-defined. But politicised responses need to learn from this, not continue the trend. Without strongly defined demands and political messages, a demonstration of this kind too easily allows itself to become defined by others projecting onto it. And when the political act can be understood as wishing to overturn their vote, the 52 per cent are unlikely to see anything positive; if they claim to see anti-democratic posturing, there is little to assure them otherwise.
Now, these tweets aren't representative and organisers can't vet every placard and tweet, but they must be expected to try and build a coherent narrative around such a mass political act. Image control is important, otherwise an act of democratic political participation might just do more harm than good.

Kevin Conroy was born on November 30, 1955 in Westbury, New York. At age 17, Kevin earned a full scholarship to attend Juilliard's drama division, where they studied under actor John Houseman. In 1978, after graduating from Juilliard, they toured with "The Acting Company", Houseman's acting group, and in 1979, they went on the national tour of "Deathtrap". In 1980, they were cast in the daytime soap opera Another World (1964). However, they soon missed the theatre, and so they became associated with the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, California, where they performed in "Hamlet" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream". From 1980 to 1985, they acted in a variety of contemporary and classic theatre pieces, including the Broadway production of "Eastern Standard" and "Lolita".  They are very respected in theatre circles for their interpretation of Shakespearean characters, and in 1984, they played the title role in "Hamlet" in the New York Shakespeare Festival. Kevin returned to television in the television movie Covenant (1985). They were a series regular on Ohara (1987) in 1987, and on Tour of Duty (1987) from 1987 to 1988, before starring in a series of television movies.  They are best known for providing the title role in the animated Batman: The Animated Series (1992) series.

Kevin Conroy is best known for their voice role as the DC Comics character Batman on the 1990s Warner Bros. television show Batman: The Animated Series, as well as various other TV series and feature films in the DC animated universe. Due to the popularity of their performance as Batman, Conroy went on to voice the character for multiple films under the DC Universe Animated Original Movies banner; along with the acclaimed video games Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009), Batman: Arkham City (2011) and Batman: Arkham Knight (2015).
As a voice actor, Kevin Conroy is best known for their starring role in the acclaimed Batman: The Animated Series (1992-1995). They continued to voice-play Batman in the subsequent spin-off series: The New Batman Adventures (1997-1999), Batman Beyond (1999-2001), Justice League (2001-2004) and Justice League Unlimited (2004-2006), all of which take place in what is commonly referred to as the DC animated universe (DCAU). Their tenure in the role also includes the theatrical film Batman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993), and the direct-to-video films Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero (1998), Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (2000) and Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman (2003). They also voiced Batman for the character's guest appearances in the DCAU's Superman: The Animated Series, Static Shock and The Zeta Project.
Conroy is well remembered by fans for being the first person in animation to use two distinct voices to portray Bruce Wayne and Batman, which Michael Keaton had previously done in Tim Burton's live-action Batman films. In a tally of performances that include every episode, movie and guest appearance made as Batman, Conroy has portrayed the character longer than any other actor in either live-action or animation. The previous record-holder was Olan Soule, who voiced Batman in various animated works between the late 1960s and early 1980s; including Super Friends. Apart from the DCAU, Conroy has also portrayed Batman in the direct-to-video DC Universe Animated Original Movies: Batman: Gotham Knight (2008), Superman/Batman: Public Enemies (2009), Superman/Batman: Apocalypse (2010), Justice League: Doom (2012), Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox (2013), Batman: Assault on Arkham (2014) and Batman: The Killing Joke(2016).

Personal Quotes (12)
Everyone is handed adversity in life. No one's journey is easy. It's how they handle it that makes people unique.
People fantasize about being a hero and helping someone in trouble. Batman is that fantasy realized--not just for Bruce Wayne, but for the audience. Inwardly, Bruce Wayne is still an adolescent watching their parents being murdered. That will never leave him. And people really relate to that.
I love doing the voice of Batman because of the quality of the animation. The music is particularly incredible. Another bonus is getting the opportunity to work with some very respected actors who do not usually do voice work.
To me, Batman is definitely Bruce Wayne's darker side. The challenge is playing it as two separate aspects of the same person. I have to create the illusion of a Dark Knight, who's mysterious and strong.
[on Michael Keaton ] They [Bruce Wayne] is Batman. They became Batman the instant their parents were murdered. Batman needs Bruce, however hollow that identity feels to them from time to time. Bruce keeps Batman human.
[on Val Kilmer in Batman Forever (1995)] To be fair, I must give credit where credit is due. Although Kilmer is clearly no Michael Keaton - except for a few corny lines, which are mainly the writers' fault, and a slight lacking when it comes to the portrayal of a dark side - they did a much better job than I expected.
[on seeing the animation for Batman: The Animated Series (1992) for the first time]: "I was really blown away. I turned to Mark [Hamill] and I was like 'Did you have any idea we were working on something like this?!'"
Everyone has a private self and a public self.
Bruce Wayne is Batman. They became Batman the instant their parents were murdered. Batman needs Bruce, however hollow that identity feels to them from time to time. Bruce keeps Batman human.
I guess I am basically most comfortable when I'm alone. As a kid, I was very much a loner. I love long distance running and long distance biking. A director once pointed out that those are all very isolated exercises you do for hours at a time.
People fantasize about being a hero and helping someone in trouble. Batman is that fantasy realized - not just for Bruce Wayne, but for the audience.
I guess the biggest challenge to doing any kind of animation voice work is that you only have your voice to tell the story.
President Obama on Wednesday will declare a national monument in southern New Mexico, delivering a win for environmentalists but angering ranchers and local law enforcement, who say the land restrictions will end up creating a safe haven for drug cartels to operate within the U.S.
Mr. Obama will declare about 500,000 acres as the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument. About half of that land is expected to be set aside as wilderness, meaning it will be closed to vehicles and construction.
Local ranchers say it's a land grab that will interfere with their grazing rights, and border security advocates said the move will make it tougher for federal agents and local police to patrol the land, leaving a security gap that Mexican smuggling cartels will exploit.
“This is about opposing so many thousands of acres that is going to create nothing more than a pathway for criminals to get into this country to do their criminal acts,” Dona Ana County Sheriff Todd Garrison told The Washington Times in a telephone interview Monday.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency refuted the claim that the national monument designation would threaten border security.
“This designation will in no way limit our ability to perform our important border security mission, and in fact provides important flexibility as we work to meet this ongoing priority,” said spokesperson Jenny Burke. “CBP is committed to continuing to work closely with the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Forest Service to maintain border security while ensuring the protection of the environment along the border.”
PHOTOS: Famous mistresses of the world's most powerful men
The monument has been in the works for some time and has been controversial from the start.
Conservationists and tourism businesses have been pushing for the designation, hoping it will bring more visitors.
“The Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument will help protect our way of life while allowing for responsible development and expanding opportunities for all Americans to enjoy the beauty and multi-cultural history of this unique landscape,” Billy Garrett, Dona Ana County Commission chairperson, said in a statement.
But land rights advocates said it is the precursor to more conflicts like the recent standoff in Nevada, where a rancher refused to comply with a court order that they stop grazing on Bureau of Land Management property, prompting the BLM to confiscate their cattle, though they were returned after a public outcry.
The BLM, which is part of the Interior Department, will administer the national monument.
The land contains five mountain ranges with fragile landscapes, prehistoric rock art and more recent historic sites such as a training area for the Apollo astronauts.
The monument would cover hundreds of thousands of acres right next to the Mexican border.
New Mexico's representatives in Congress have been divided over the monument. Rep. Stevan Pearce, a Republican, called for a 50,000-acre monument, one-tenth the size of the one Mr. Obama will designate.
But the half-million-acre proposal has the backing of the state's U.S. senators, both of them Democrats.
“An Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument will preserve important cultural links to our past and strengthen southern New Mexico's economy by boosting tourism and recreational opportunities, like hunting, hiking, camping, and horseback riding,” Sen. Martin Heinrich said in a statement.
Only Congress can declare a national park, which stops most land uses. But under the 1906 Antiquities Act the president has the power to declare national monuments, which offer heightened environmental protections.
The New Mexico monument is Mr. Obama's second designation this year. In March, they added 1,600 acres in the Point Arena-Stornetta region to the California Coastal National Monument established by President Clinton in 2000. House Republicans said the action wasn't necessary because they had passed similar legislation that was awaiting Senate action.
About half the Organ Mountains monument will be designated as wilderness, the highest level of protection, closing it to motorized vehicles and human construction.
Sheriff Garrison said that will shut down roads that their department uses to patrol the land, though they said the cartels are unlikely to stop using it just because it is declared wilderness.
“My fear is these areas will be used more than they are now because they'll have access to it that will be private and closed off to every law-abiding citizen,” the sheriff said. “I believe this monument will hamper law enforcement's ability to effectively patrol the area we need to patrol.”
Administration officials said the declaration will incorporate a 2006 agreement between the Interior Department and the Homeland Security Department that allows U.S. Border Patrol some access to the land.
That agreement prevents most routine patrols through wilderness, though it does allow them to continue to follow smugglers in hot pursuit.
The agreement has been controversial for both sides of the immigration debate. Environmentalists and some immigrant rights advocates argue that the Border Patrol has used the arrangement to trample pristine land. Border security advocates say agents' hands are tied when they are in pursuit of illegal immigrants and drug smugglers.
Rep. Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican who has studied the issue, argues that the environmental restrictions have indeed hurt the Border Patrol's ability to do its job.
Hours before news of the designation broke Monday, Mr. Bishop, chairperson of the Natural Resources Committee's public lands subcommittee, sent a letter to Mr. Obama asking them to hold off until the border can be controlled.
“It's irresponsible to focus efforts on new land designations rather than finding solutions to existing criminal activities plaguing the border,” the member of congress wrote.
Mr. Bishop pointed to a case that was in the headlines last week, in which a National Park Service employee at Chiricahua National Monument in Arizona detailed the vicious attack they suffered at the hands of an illegal immigrant. Authorities said the man smashed their head into a metal bathroom door and hit their head with a rock, striking so hard that the rock broke.

Ted Cruz wanted to leave Republican delegates with a case of buyer's remorse.
The plan was carefully scripted: snub Donald Trump by not endorsing them at the Republican convention on Wednesday night. Unleash a stirring cry for conservative values that would evoke memories of Ronald Reagan's 1976 clarion call at Gerald Ford's coronation. That show-stealing speech set Reagan on a glide path to the 1980 nomination, which is what Cruz is hoping for in 2020.
But the plan went awry, and sparked an ugly clash at the GOP convention in Cleveland. As Cruz's speech dragged past the 20-minute mark with just a perfunctory mention of Trump's triumph, the crowd grew restive. “Say their name!” some Trump allies shouted. “Go home!” others yelled.
Then the host themselves twisted the knife. As Cruz was wrapping up, Trump stepped on their peroration, walking into the arena to join family in their VIP box. The boos for the Texan rang long and loud. Two Trump sources told TIME the outburst was orchestrated by the campaign after they were tipped off that Cruz would withhold the endorsement.

The speech was a gamble that could upend the 2016 runner-up's planning for 2020 and shape the contours of a coming party fight should Trump lose. Some RNC officials believe Cruz is actively laying the groundwork for a presidential run in four years regardless of what happens in November. That could set up a remarkable challenge to a sitting President from their own party.
For Cruz, the prime-time address was an all-in wager. Decline to endorse at Trump's coronation, and Cruz might alienate millions of Republicans at a moment when they are trying to recast themselves as a team player. Embrace Trump, and risk tainting a personal brand built on conservative purity. Not to mention help a man who insulted their wife and father.
Most Republicans eyeing future runs for national office have embraced Trump. That's a product of calculation, not affection: many worry a failure to fall in line could backfire if the outspoken billionaire blames their defeat on their disloyalty. But Cruz has made the case for a year that the GOP loses when it nominates insufficiently conservative candidates. And he's betting a Trump loss would prove their point.
Before the speech, Cruz's most-passionate supporters were split on the best course of action. The move wasn't made lightly; much of the address was crafted by Cruz himself. In the end, it was a bet that kneecapping Trump would help push the party toward a conservative revolution, with the Texan at the head of the column.

“I want to congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night,” Cruz began. Of course, Trump had effectively clinched the nomination months earlier. And Cruz never mentioned the man at the top of the ticket again.
The dramatic set piece followed negotiations between the two campaigns and Republican officials, as well as a phone call between the candidates themselves. The speaking slot was one element of an agreement that prevented Cruz's name from being placed into nomination during the roll call of the states on Tuesday night.
But if Trump's team expected a graceful concession, the patina of deference was short-lived. In a convention conspicuously light on Trump accolades, the nonendorsement was the sharpest blow yet. It sent an unmistakable message that four months before the 2016 election, the battle for 2020 has already begun.

Weeks ago, in fact. It's easy to spot the signs across Cleveland: Senator Tom Cotton, the ambitious first-year student from Arkansas, stopped in on a breakfast of New Hampshire delegates; Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who may be gearing up for another go, hobnobbed with early state activists. Walker must first win re-election, but “he'll be back” on the national stage, an aide told TIME this week.
Nobody has spent as much time charting their postelection path like Cruz. They dropped out after their defeat in Indiana on May 3, but it was a case of leaving one race to join another. They have continued to spend money. Allies hatched a plan over the next four years to smooth Cruz's reputation as a solitary climber by parceling out cash to select Republican allies.
Aides closely monitored the snuffed delegate revolts against Trump, ready to pounce if opportunity struck, yet careful to avoid any fingerprints. A brawl over the rules that will govern the next Republican nominating contest was driven by Cruz loyalists. The ham-handed effort, which could have excluded anyone who isn't a registered Republican from future primaries, was a change expected to benefit the Texas purist if it had passed.

Cruz's close-knit corps of political advisers has never left their side. Some key staff, including strategist David Polyansky and communications hand Catherine Frazier, migrated back to their Senate office. Others landed at a pair of new nonprofit groups that will tend their interests, keep talent in house and prepare for their 2018 Senate re-election. But that is not the ultimate goal.
A second run for the presidency is almost surely in Cruz's future. “He's 45 years old,” campaign manager Jeff Roe told reporters on Wednesday. “He came in second.” You can read between the lines.
The only question is when. “I expect Ted Cruz to run no matter what” in 2020, said Carroll Maxwell, a delegate from McKinney, Texas, who was waiting Wednesday afternoon to enter a crowded party Cruz threw at a bar to thank supporters. “That's what I'd like to see.”
But among their most fervent fans, there was no consensus about how Cruz should handle their speech Wednesday night. Many said they should back an imperfect nominee for the sake of party unity; others were aghast at the idea. “He can't,” Arizona delegate Gayla Coletto said of a Trump endorsement. “If they do that, he'll lose 90% of us.”
Gesturing at the lengthy line on a hot afternoon, Jean Griswold, a delegate from Concord, N.C., and a member of Cruz's Tar Heel State steering committee, tried to explain the ardor fans feel for the Texas Senator. “The people you see here would walk over glass for him,” they said. “As we look to 2020 or 2024, these people here will all be there for him.”
The question after their risky bet on Wednesday night is whether that's still true.

Pittsburgh International Airport officials think they are poised to capitalize on the airport's real estate holdings because of an expected surge in businesses looking for space near Royal Dutch Shell's multibillion-dollar petro­chemical plant site.
Shell officials in June said construction of the plant — the first major ethane cracker to be built outside the Gulf Coast in 20 years — will begin within 18 months and wrap up “early in the next decade.”
Civic and business leaders believe the plant will be a boon for the region's economy. Allegheny County Airport Authority CEO Christina Cassotis said airport officials will make it clear to developers that they'll need to act if they want to lease airport land, which is less than 15 miles from the cracker plant site. Authority staff are studying how best to maximize the airport's real estate assets in conjunction with Shell's plans, they said.
“We have a limited amount of acreage here, and we happen to be in a pretty hot area …” Cassotis said. “We want to make sure we're looking at highest and best use; we're looking at what's best for the region, but we're not sitting on this land for five years until somebody decides they want to build.”
Private companies during the past two decades invested about $350 million in the area as they developed 3 million square feet in manufacturing, industrial, office and cargo space on portions of 8,800 acres owned by the authority. Another 3,800 acres of authority-owned land are available for development under long-term lease agreements that ensure the authority retains ownership rights.
County Executive Rich Fitzgerald last month called the ethane cracker plant “one of the biggest things to happen in this region in literally decades” and said it's led to “a lot of growth” in companies wanting to locate their operations on authority-owned land in the airport corridor.
Imperial Land Corp. President Jerry Bunda said it's a little too soon to see the cracker plant's tangible impact on airport corridor development, but they believe it's coming.
“I think people are starting to position themselves to get ready for that,” Bunda said. “But as of now, that's not happened yet.”
Gary McCormick, founder and broker of record at McCormick Real Estate Management LLC, said they think the cracker plant development actually could lead to a shift, with more businesses going across the Allegheny County line into Beaver County, in part because Beaver County offers a lower tax rate.
But McCormick and Bunda said the airport corridor's real estate market is strong, largely as a result of the area's proximity to infrastructure such as highways and the airport itself.
The authority will collect an estimated $1.8 million in real estate revenue in 2016, according to its budget, a small part of the airport's $55.1 million in total budgeted non-aeronautical revenue, which includes rental car, parking and concessions income.
The airport's development activity is intended more to drive regional economic growth than revenue for the authority, Cassotis said. But airport officials try to maximize their real estate development return.
Development on airport land benefits municipalities, too. The airport doesn't pay taxes on undeveloped land, but firms occupying space on airport land must pay property taxes.
Several ongoing development efforts could help to that end while the authority works toward a formal post-cracker announcement development strategy.
Arguably the most ambitious development hopes rest with a plan to transform 195 acres dotted with three former coal mines due west of the main airport facility into a mixed-use commercial and retail space. Cassotis said site design for the Pittsburgh International Airport World Trade Center is ongoing as airport officials search for a “marquee tenant” to occupy the proposed facility, which could include offices, a hotel and convention space.
“Like anything, you want to find your anchor,” they said.
That project to date has received about $7 million in state grant funding and is slated to benefit from another $1 million in federal funding intended for cleanup related to the old mines.
County officials have said royalty payments from a natural gas drilling deal with Consol Energy Inc. of Cecil could offset some costs related to the project. Consol previously signed a deal with the county that paid the authority $46 million up front plus additional royalties on production from wells drilled on airport property.
Airport and Consol officials Monday plans to publicly announce initial production at the airport wells, according to a Consol news release.
Cassotis said some of the royalties could go toward the World Trade Center project, but they added airport officials must be careful in how they allocate gas drilling revenue. They've pledged a portion of that money to lowering airlines' cost per enplaned passenger and backlogged capital improvements.
The World Trade Center site would compete with the capital projects backlog for funding, they said.

When in doubt, pout.
President Trump told staffers working on their campaign that they wanted to look 'like [Winston] Churchill' in photographs and images, believing that they would appear tougher according to a new report in The New York Times.
That is why Donnie, like Winnie, reportedly prefers to scowl, squint and maintain a general sourpuss on their face whenever they are in front of a camera.
It also explains why President Trump may have returned the bust of the prime minister to the Oval Office, with the proximity to their own desk allowing them to practice the downcast frown and furrowed brow favored by the former leader of the United Kingdom.
There is little else Trump has in common with Churchill however, who was a wartime hero, a lifelong politician, a writer, a painter, a loyal husband and a celebrated orator whose most famous speech was a passionate denouncement of the policies and politics of Russia at the start of the Cold War.

Churchill managed to amass a remarkable resume of impressive accomplishments over the course of their lifetime, achieving an unprecedented number of feats in their 90 years.
By the age of 25, Churchill had fought in four wars, written three books about their experiences on the battlefield and laid the groundwork for their political career with their one, and only, unsuccessful run for Parliament.
It was at that age that Churchill, while acting as a wartime correspondent during the Second Boer War, was captured and placed in a South African POW camp.
They were able to eventually escape, and their heroics at the time would have likely been awarded with a military medal many believed, but this was not possible due to the fact that they were a civilian.
Trump had just been handed their father's company at the age of 25, with their first move being to change the name from Elizabeth Trump & Son to the Trump Organization.
The Vietnam War was still playing out overseas, but Trump managed to avoid the draft with four student deferments while in college and later a medical deferment because they claimed to have 'heel spurs.'
It was at this age that Trump and their father began to draw the attention of the Justice Department, who had received multiple complaints that the organization was systematically discriminating against African Americans looking to rent apartments in their buildings.

Rare smile: President Trump and Churchill relaying a message of peace and showing off a small smile
Churchill was elected to parliament for the first time in 1900, and soon began to rise up the ranks in the 40 years until they became prime minister.
During that time they also became a renowned wartime hero known the world over for their valor on the western front while continuing to be a voracious writer and historian who in 1953 was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.
They also picked up painting as a hobby along the way, and created a number of critically praised landscapes.
President Trump, whose proposed budget would cut all funding to public arts, once destroyed two Art Deco friezes from the front of the building them knocked down to build Trump Tower despite having promised to donate them to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
They were never a wartime hero and did not serve in political office, but did publicly accuse the sitting president of forging their birth certificate in order to lie about the country of their birth.
And though the real estate scion did release a number of books over the past three decades, no literary accolades have come theirs way.

Angrily aloof: Churchill was also one of the first leaders to denounce the policies and politics of Russia in their famous 'Iron Curtain' speech at the start of the Cold War
But Trump, like Churchill, does press their face into a squinty-eye scowl while being photographed.
The two men were also both Americans, with Churchill becoming the very first of just eight people to be granted an honorary citizenship.
I've been writing about my experiences of being a Medical Marijuana patient for two years now. I've often talked about the way I use cannabis: in small doses, not enough to get high, but enough to make a change.
Suddenly (in the shower, of course!) a word came to me out of nowhere: microdose. I had never heard it in my life as far as I knew, but it was clearly time to do some research using the old Google. Turns out that microdosing is indeed a thing on your planet , and it has some relevance to psychedelics (coincidentally or not, some of the related experiences sound a lot like happy cannabis users), but there's relatively little talk about the word “microdose” in connection with cannabis. So it's time for us to claim it, because it's one of those words that almost explains itself. Almost…but not quite.
So, for the record, Wikipedia defines microdosing as “a technique for studying the behavior of drugs in humans through the administration of doses so low (“sub-therapeutic”) they are unlikely to produce whole-body effects, but high enough to allow the cellular response to be studied. ” In the medical cannabis context, I'd like to similarly define microdosing as “a technique for using cannabis in humans through the administration of doses so low (“sub-psychoactive”) they are unlikely to produce gross body or mind effects, but high enough to allow the subtle and positive changes in thinking, feeling, and pain relief that the patient desires.”
What do I mean by subtle changes? Well, you might not want to go numb, but you'd want your pain to disappear. You don't want to get giddy and high, you just want your depression and brain fog to go away. You don't want to feel stoned, you just want your anxiety to go away. That's right, world: we medical marijuana patients don't want what you think we want. And the proof is right here in what we're talking about.
Microdosing Techniques
The trick is to develop a procedure for a dose, measured in some ways clear to you, that works consistently to get you to the appropriate level of consciousness: that place where you can feel something different in your body and mind, but you're not feeling high or impaired or stoned or in any way out of control. For most people, this will be somewhere between [1] and [3].
Finding the right dose is called titrating, and the procedure varies based on the method of medicinal intake you prefer:
Lessons Never Learned: Nonprofits and the State, Redux
RAIDER NATION COLLECTIVE, Oakland and Los Angeles
“Peace after revolution”
—Erykah Badu
We were not surprised to hear of a recent meeting between the Oakland state apparatus (Mayor Ron Dellums and the Oakland Police Department) and representatives of the local nonprofit industrial complex. Nor were we surprised when the nonprofits emerged from that meeting with directives from the Mayor and the Police on how best to prevent and preemptively condemn civil rebellion in the case of the acquittal of Johannes Mehserle for the murder of Oscar Grant, or Mehserle's conviction on a lesser charge. Why were we not surprised? Quite simply because what we are witnessing is a virtual repeat of last year's controversy surrounding the short-lived Coalition Against Police Executions (CAPE), one which shows that the lessons of 2009 have fallen upon deaf ears.
On January 23, 2010 Nicole Lee of the Urban Peace Movement distributed an email, which astonishingly focused more on preventing rebellion than on ensuring that justice be served. The Urban Peace Movement is funded by the Movement Strategy Center, an umbrella organization representing a broad swath of the Bay Area nonprofit scene: from the Ella Baker Center to Just Cause and the School of Unity and Liberation (that is, many of the nonprofits rooted in the now-defunct STORM), and with connections to the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Brothers' Foundation, among others. UPM also currently advertises its participation in a Pepsi-sponsored fundraising scheme. In other words, UPM is deeply embedded within the nonprofit-industrial complex, and doesn't try to hide it.
Now, to Lee's email—entitled “Bracing for Mehserle Verdict: Community Engagement Plan”—and whose primary aim is not demanding justice, but rather preventing any militant popular response to an unjust verdict. They urge nonprofits and progressives to band together with their “partners and allies” in an effort to create a plan to prevent an explosion after the verdict, and these “partners and allies” include not only nonprofits (i.e. The Ella Baker Center, Oakland Rising, BWOPA) but also “the Mayor's Office and the City of Oakland.”
In Lee's email, it soon becomes apparent that “engaging” the community is clearly code for manipulating and co-opting the popular anger that will rightly greet anything less than a murder conviction. They urge groups to “ create organized events or avenues for young people and community members to express their frustrations with the system in constructive and peaceful ways,” with the implication being that constructive=peaceful (more on this below). More surprisingly, they argue that “We need to begin 'innoculating' our bases and the community at-large so that when the verdict comes down, people are prepared for it, and so that the ‘outside agitators' who were active during the initial Oscar Grant protests are not able to incite the crowd so easily.”
They continue: “our main concern is the safety and well-being of Oakland's young people. We do not want to see them get taken to jail or hurt as a result of violent or destructive behavior brought on or encouraged by ‘extreme-fringe' groups coming into Oakland from the outside.”
These claims are then followed by two sets of talking points, one dumbed-down and spiced up for a “youth audience.” The latter are replete with references to the “constructive” work of Martin and Malcolm, and end with the call: “Instead, let's hold our heads high and throw up our fists in solidarity like Huey did!!”
Lee's open collaboration with the state becomes shockingly clear once we visit the website of the City of Oakland, where we find a near-replica of Lee's email coming out of the virtual mouth of the city administration itself, and crediting UPM for its contribution. And as we write this, the financial impetus for this unlikely partnership is becoming clear: there is word on the street that these same nonprofits are participating in a city-sponsored “speak-out” for which the city is paying bribes of $40 to participants and $100 to nonprofit organizers who turn people out to the event.
Several days later, a clever hoax email under the title “Keep it Cool After the Verdict” emerged which was spoofed to appear as though it had come from Lee herself. While Lee responded with indignant pleas for solidarity at an alleged identity theft, they did not address the fundamental reason that many had initially believed the email was the real thing: the fundamental points were the same. The hoax email was merely a slightly exaggerated version of Lee's own open condescension toward the youth and willingness to collaborate with the state.
As participants in the rebellions of January 2009, most of us residents of the City of Oakland, we must respond to this condescending whitewashing of our history with five points:
1.) The “Outside Agitator” Soundbyte
We had hoped that this one was dead for good, as many participants had clearly debunked it, but Lee shows that, despite all evidence to the contrary, some people will insist on repeating discredited and condescending arguments despite how totally implausible they may be.
In the immediate aftermath of the first Oscar Grant rebellion on January 7th of 2009, OPD took their message to the press: this was all the fault of “outside agitators.” Echoing Bull Connor's attack on those who went to Selma, Alabama to fight for civil rights, the police sought to discredit the rebellion while sowing division among those struggling for justice.
To some degree, they were successful. Despite not being present themselves for the rebellion, nonprofit leaders working under the banner of the Coalition Against Police Executions (CAPE), immediately began to parrot the police line, attacking “outside agitators” for leading the Black youth of Oakland astray, and tacitly (if not explicitly) suggesting that those who tore up the streets were white anarchists from the suburbs.
As participants in those rebellions, we saw something very different: a multiracial crowd of primarily Black and Brown youth expressing righteous anger at the state's refusal to indict one of their own (we encourage readers to consult the various images from the rebellions to get a feel for their makeup). The “outside agitator” soundbyte was also thoroughly discredited in street-level reports by JR Valrey of the SF Bayview, George Ciccariello-Maher of Counterpunch, and Minster Keith Muhammad, among others.
But some soundbytes die hard, especially when these are so useful to governing elites seeking to divide our movements. Thus when a large and multiracial group protesting cuts to and privatization of public education took over and blocked the 980 in Downtown Oakland, we found it necessary to yet again combat attempts to trot out the “outside agitator” story in an effort to erase the many people of color who took to the highway.
2.) Nonprofits and the State
Eventually, many in CAPE backtracked, but not without attempting to defend the state by becoming movement police and kicking this same youth they claimed to represent off the street on January 14th. CAPE's obvious efforts to stabilize the state and prevent rebellion (while offering no real strategy for achieving justice) brought about harsh critiques from Advance the Struggle and theOakland chapter of Bring the Ruckus. As our Advance the Struggle comrades put it:
Through their “buffer” tactics and diversions from confrontational struggle, Bay Area nonprofits effectively acted as an extension of the state. Nonprofit funding from foundations suffocates the development of a real revolutionary formation, keeping the politics of the nonprofit organization safely within the bounds of the rules of the system…. Despite frequent references to the radical legacy of Oakland, CAPE behaved as an extension of the state, “organizing” people to be peaceful, go home and not take militant action in the streets.
CAPE eventually splintered over these same questions, with a handful of coalition members rightfully recognizing the critiques before them. To their credit, many from CAPE learned an important lesson and we applaud that. Some in the nonprofit community clearly have not, as Lee's email makes more than obvious.
3.) Condescending to the “Youth Audience”
One of the most galling parts of Lee's email—and the nonprofit approach to their “community” more generally, is the sheer condescension it displays toward the members of that community, especially the youth. This appears in two ways in Lee's email.
Firstly, the claim about “outside agitators” itself implies that Black and Brown youth are incapable of making good decisions or analyzing their situation, and are easily swept up into following “outside agitators” (again, read: “white anarchists”), who lead them, like a black-clad Pied Piper, down the path of destruction. As we will see below, this claim is the only way the nonprofits have to divert attention from their lack of a strategy for social change.
Secondly, we see this same condescending and patronizing attitude in Lee's email itself, with its two lists of talking points, one for adults and one for a “youth audience.” This is an openly manipulative ploy which implies, again, that young community members cannot possibly understand the proper path to social change if it isn't dumbed-down for them.
If not to manipulate the youth, then why are talking points necessary in the first place? If not to manipulate the youth, then why the dumbed-down version for a “youth audience”? And if not to manipulate the youth, then why the opportunistic references to Martin, Malcolm, and Huey, references which, as we will see below, do not accurately reflect history?
Clearly, what Lee and others fear from so-called non-existent or imagined “outside agitators” is not the manipulation they claim to oppose, but a viewpoint that differs from their own.
4.) The Uses and Abuses of the Panthers
The most infuriating part of Lee's email by far is their references to Martin, Malcolm, and especially to Huey P. Newton of the Black Panther Party. To put it bluntly: what the hell do they think Huey was doing, or Martin and Malcolm for that matter? What do they think the Panthers stood for?
Let's start with what they didn't stand for: collaboration with the state and ruling elites. And the Panthers had a phrase, adapted from Mao Tse-Tung, to express this position: “Contradictions among the people are reconcilable, but contradictions between the people and the state are irreconcilable.” What is it about “irreconcilable” that Lee and the nonprofiteers don't understand? The Panthers were not all free breakfast programs: they were also about organizing the youth in a non-condescending way to fight the very same state that Lee would see as an “ally and partner.”
But in reality, this isn't about what the Panthers did or didn't say. It's about a strategic attempt by the nonprofits to perform their function of protecting the state, something which they do all the more effectively the more radical their rhetoric. By saying radical-sounding things, they are able to present themselves as the voice of the people, which makes them all the more powerful when they decide to sell us up the river.
5.) The Master's Tools?
We can't end without responding to the underlying premise of Lee's email, and indeed of the entire state-entangled nonprofit “strategy,” one which evidently attempts—in the words of Audre Lorde—to use only the “master's tools” to build the new world (and indeed to even recruit the master themselves into this process).
Nonprofit efforts to harness and channel popular anger down “constructive” pathways and Lee's insistence that Martin and Malcolm were examples of “constructive” approaches to change are deceptively deployed to prop up the idea that working with the state is the only truly “constructive” way of approaching social change. This is the lure of the nonprofit: they promise access to the levers of power if we behave correctly, and it is only by convincing us to behave that they prove to the state and their corporate masters that they can be trusted with that power.
But now as before, we must return to the single fundamental truth of the Oakland rebellions: nothing has been more “constructive” than the popular fury unleashed in January. Without these intermittent explosions, Mehserle would never have been arrested, would never have been indicted, and most certainly wouldn't be facing a murder charge. Our power lies not in opportunistic deal-making with Dellums behind closed doors: it lies in the streets and it is homegrown, while the “outside agitators” line is an ideological construct meant to stifle rebellion.
Before and during the rebellions, the nonprofits were telling us that taking to the streets wouldn't be “constructive,” but they were wrong then and they're wrong now. The young people of color who took to the streets, the “youth audience” for which the nonprofits emit mindless “talking points,” they knew what was “constructive” all along and they've recognized the fruits of their efforts in the current trial of Johannes Mehserle.
It is this sort of constructiveness that will build the new world!

Nintendo Switch Port of Extinction Being Considered by Maximum Games
Tomas Franzese June 14, 2017 3:33:08 AM EST
Maximum Games didn't initially consider porting Extinction to Nintendo Switch, but now they're thinking about it.
On June 1, Iron Galaxy and Maximum Games unveiled their new action-adventure orc-slaying game Extinction, and DualShockers got the opportunity to preview an early build of the game and talk to Executive Producer Derek Neal about the title at E3 this year.
While only PC, PS4, and Xbox One versions of Extinction have been announced, Derek Neal mentioned in our discussion that they are now considering bringing Extinction to Nintendo Switch due to demand from their fans:
“As far as Extinction, it wasn't part of our original plan to bring Extinction to the Switch, but actually we've gotten this question a lot. A lot of people seem excited about the prospect of having this title on the Switch, so we are re-evaluating those options and seeing if maybe that is something we want to do. But that decision hasn't been made yet
While Derek isn't part of the core Iron Galaxy team, they did state that the developer has been “involved” with some Nintendo Switch projects, although they have not been unveiled yet:
I'm not myself a member of Iron Galaxy, but to speak for them, I believe they have, yes, been involved directly with some Switch development.
Stay tuned for our preview and full interview with Derek Neal about Extinction in the coming days. Extinction is currently still slated to come to PC, PS4, and Xbox One in early 2018, but we will be sure to tell you all if a Nintendo Switch version is confirmed.
The United States Federal Budget for Fiscal Year 2010, titled A New Era of Responsibility: Renewing America's Promise,[6] is a spending request by President Barack Obama to fund government operations for October 2009–September 2010.

Around 7:08 p.m. on Thursday, lines of cars decorated in bright window paint sped up and down the Hill on South Mountain. With horns honking and music blasting, the girls of the Delta Gamma sorority were angry. Less than 10 minutes earlier, Delta Gamma officials and Lehigh's Office of Sorority and Fraternity Affairs had notified them that their chapter would be closing. At their home sat Pam Reppert, their chef since 2007, unaware and uniformed that they had just lost their job.
They could keep their chef for two more weeks, OFSA told the girls. After that, Reppert would be unemployed and the girls would be placed on a meal plan for the remaining months of school. A junior in DG had to text Pam to let them know of the situation because OFSA has yet to inform them that she's lost their job.
The fact that Pam had to ask a student to text them when DG found out whether or not they had a job is sad enough. The fact that the student had to go through with it is even worse. And the fact that they have still not been informed by the school is absolutely ridiculous.
But beyond that, the fact that the sorority closing means that Pam has to lose their job is simply ridiculous. The girls will still be living in the house, the kitchen is there and the girls have paid for the meal plan. Why not let them keep their job through the remainder of the semester?
Pam loves their job, and the girls love Pam too. “I really do love my job. I have always told my friends this is my dream job. Not too many people can say that,” they said. “I enjoy cooking, trying new recipes. I even have someone to wash the dishes for me, and always someone to talk to. I have summers off, fall break, winter break, spring break.”
The way that Lehigh treated DG's chef is one small example of how poorly university leaders handled a bad situation. It's clear that OFSA would rather punish the members of DG than respect their own employees. The girls are allowed to live in the house the remainder of the semester, so in order to fire Pam, Lehigh has to refund money to the girls, set them up with a meal plan, and allegedly remove and replace the stove. Why not just let Pam stay? It seems much easier.
Pam has been married 28 years, their husband's name is Willy, and has two girls, 24 and 22. From them, they have two “awesome” grandchildren: Mikey is 7 years old and Karissa is 5 months old. All of the DG girls know Mikey well because Pam often brings them in with them to work. “He's my little helper. And Karissa is growing up so fast. Them smile just makes me smile,” said Pam.
They chose to fire this mother, grandmother and wife, and go through the effort of prorating over 60 meal plans rather than simply letting Pam keep their job until the end of the year. It's unprofessional, rude and downright heartless.
On Dec. 19 Lehigh was notified by Delta Gamma's national leaders that the charter may be pulled. The school had more than 60 days to deal with this situation and come up with a fair way to deal with Reppert, yet they came up with nothing. Then, even though Delta Gamma's executive offices reached their decision Feb. 17, Lehigh still didn't inform Pam. They say that no one from Lehigh or DG ever contacted them and that the only information they were given was by the Fraternity Management Association. They said that the sorority might be kicked off, and if that happens they might be fired.
They were given dates of when decisions would be made, but then dates were altered and pushed back even further. Even though Lehigh did not ultimately decide to kick the house off of the Hill, they do have the power to allow Pam to keep their job, especially with rumors that a fraternity will be occupying the building in the fall.
“I have worked many long hours cooking and I do enjoy my time off. But not the time off I will be getting in two weeks,” they said. “I have bills to pay. Why do I have to be punished?”

TL;DR
This happened to me (I was at the receiving end of this "business model")
I started to work on EatFab sometimes in November 2011 in order to solve the problems we faced with food ordering management (the major problem is that a lot of time is spent to centralize the orders). We started to use it at my current employer in September 2012.
Marius Mocian, told us. Everything seemed to work well, we exchanged ideas, we talked about what we're working on, the problems we faced and we had brainstorming sessions whenever someone raised an issue. Except that when Marius was asked what they were working on they were always vague, saying only that they mostly mentor other startups. In December 2012 I found out about Open Coffee Cluj - a group formed for the like minded people, entrepreneurs and people with initiative. At least that's what the organizer of the meetups,, told us. Everything seemed to work well, we exchanged ideas, we talked about what we're working on, the problems we faced and we had brainstorming sessions whenever someone raised an issue. Except that when Marius was asked what they were working on they were always vague, saying only that they mostly mentor other startups.
Six months later, around May 2013, a mobile application is launched for the food delivery market in Cluj-Napoca. Shockingly (in an unpleasant way) for me, I find out that Marius Mocian is the one responsible with the marketing of the app, with some responsibilities in product development and they were occupying that role for several months. While keeping their main occupation secret until the last time is legal, I find this to be immoral, to say the least, because they kept organizing the startup related meetups and encouraged us to keep giving statuses related to our workings.
Although all of my gut feeling alarms went crazy, I deceived myself by telling me that it just looks like we're competing in the same market: their application is for individual deliveries, while EatFab is for office food ordering, so we're kind of complementary and they didn't have any kind of moral duties to disclose they are deeply involved in development of a competing application.
So, I continued going to the events they organized and continued to be very open related to EatFab - that's what you read on hackernews /r/technology and /r/startups afterall: be as open as possible and let as many people as possible know about your ideas. I brought several people to the meetings, in the hope that we'll grow the whole startup community together. I also went to the Startup Live event that they organized in Cluj just because they didn't have enough participants - I convinced one of the Evozon's owners to pay the tickets for a whole team there and also persuaded several other developer friends to come. All of this, just to help the local startup community to grow and to have meaningful events here.
The cunning gets real
In September 2013, I saw an ad on the biggest social network, aimed exactly to EatFab's market: office food ordering. After thorough investigation (because the domain owner enabled private registration), I found out that the man behind it is Andrei Barabas, the owner of Barandi Solutions - a company from Cluj, with its owner deeply involved in the startup "community" created by Marius Mocian. Andrei also participated to the Startup Live event I mentioned earlier, as a mentor and member of the jury.
Let me remind you that this was happening almost a year after I told them about my approach on the food ordering market: office delivery for groups of people. And 4 months after Marius's application launch (not quite their app - he's just an employee there) - an application that didn't have the expected impact on the market, although it's a very sexy application and they had a decent budget for marketing.
I found the idea of a competing web application, exactly in Cluj, exactly on the main workings of EatFab, after a very short period of an unsatisfactory launch of a competing app, done by a guy who knew about EatFab as a huge coincidence.
Being in the same market, I thought about letting Marius Mocian know about my findings.
I also asked them if they know anything about it - their answer was a very strong "I have no clue", but said that he'll ask Andrei about it. A few days later I asked Marius if they talked with Andrei and they said that yes, but that they can't tell what the site is about and that I'll have to ask Andrei.
Today I met with Andrei (the guy who works on EatFab's copycat) and asked them about what he's working on.
Their answer "The web part of Marius's application"
Business rules, and types of people
Marius Mocian did is not illegal (not from what I know at least), it is highly immoral: lying, deceiving, cunning and betraying are not healthy ways to build communities and businesses. While my unfair advantage is the usage of While whatdid is not illegal (not from what I know at least),: lying, deceiving, cunning and betraying are not healthy ways to build communities and businesses. While myis the usage of +Perl and +Mojolicious , having a high productivity and short time to market, it looks like Marius takes the idea of unfair advantage literally.
Marius's kind of people when employed, are able to develop a parallel business based on your business model while you pay them a monthly income in good faith. They're able to steal the source code of your application, put a different skin on it and try to build a company based on it (Marius said once that copycats of their app started to appear on the market soon after their launch - an affirmation which in hindsight might mean more than I thought).
I hate rants and public complaints, and this post is exactly that, but, while I learned about Marius Mocian the hard way, I want to ask you to help other people find out about this typology.
So, please share this article on reddit, hackernews and wherever other people involved in technology and startups are present so that when someone will be interested to collaborate with Marius, they'll do it knowingly.
Also, by making this type of articles popular, people will become aware on the importance of honesty and will realize that the greatest asset we have as individuals is our reputation.
Organize meetings, social events and hackathons, pretend you want to help the community, then use the ideas you saw there to serve your personal purpose. In order for this to work, you have to keep for yourself everything that you work on until the launch day, while you encourage the participants to tell you as much as possible about their businesses. If they ask you something about what you're working on, lie to them, otherwise they might not come to your future events.

Tottenham boss Andre Villas-Boas is hoping to solve their goal-scoring crisis with a January loan deal for Real Madrid starlet Alvaro Morata.
Villas-Boas was hoping to sign the 21-year-old striker in the summer as part of Gareth Bale's £85million move from the White Hart Lane club to Real.
The Bernabeu giants' new boss Carlo Ancelotti blocked the move then, but now has had a change of heart as they believe it will help the Spain Under-21 international's career.
Tottenham have been back in for them and held talks with Morata, with Villas-Boas making personal contact to try to convince them to come to the Premier League.
They have also persuaded Morata's representatives that a move would be good as they are convinced they will get regular games.
Tottenham have managed just nine goals in the Premier League this season - three of them penalties - and new £26m striker Roberto Soldado has endured mixed fortunes.
Spurs chairperson Daniel Levy may also be ready to offload England striker Jermain Defoe in January, with MLS side Toronto keen.
Defoe could also be a target for West Ham, Sunderland or Hull, with the lure of more regular football in a World Cup year.
But Spurs would not let them go without reinforcements arriving in January and Morata is clearly a top priority.
Check out what Morata has in their locker:
Well, this is it – final WIP post on my Barbatos Lupus Custom.
All the mods are complete. By the time I finish writing this, I'll probably be halfway through the decal stage.
Well, maybe not all the mods. I set a deadline for this build – 31st December. Without it, I'd probably end up working on it for another year. Considering I still needed to paint, decal and weather the kit, I had a tough decision on my hands. I needed to ask myself which mods should I finish and which ones to drop. And so I axed a bunch of things I originally planned to add. Things like Sinanju-style backpack, Rex-like tails/whips and some more weapons. This clear distinction helped me greatly over the last few weeks. Instead of endlessly wondering how to approach some future mods, I could focus on actually getting shit done.
I'm still far from done, but with the modding stage closed, end of this project is finally in sight. Strange feeling. Anyway, let's get on with the mods.
Replacing side skirts
This one was on my to-do list for a couple of months now. While original Barbatos Lupus side skirts look interesting, somehow they just didn't fit. Especially with all the proportion mods. It's also one of the more challenging mods I did. Going in, I had completely no idea how to tackle it.
Initially I started out with a big rectangle of 2mm pla-plate that I slowly filed into shape. Later on I created side walls using 3mm L-shaped styrene strips and added layer of 1mm styrene to close it off. Next I evened out the edges with epoxy putty and carved out some space for a vent. Done. “That's it?” You might ask. Yeah, that's it. I hated how it turned out. To the trash bin it goes. Actual new side skirts For the second attempt, I decided to try and actually design them beforehand. Mostly by doodling random stuff at work. I probably had 10 pages like these before finally settling on a design loosely based on Freedom 2.0 side skirts. Obviously I won't be adding rail guns to Barbatos, but the piece that holds them looks really nice. I wanted to draw the final design on a millimeter paper to create a template – like the sword in WIP#1. I couldn't find any though – I must have left it behind while moving. That's when I remembered those awesome Tamiya masking sheets. I bought them months ago, but never got around to using them. Advantage of drawing a design on a masking sheet. Cut it out and you have an instant template you can stick onto the plastic. This time around I decided to start with 1mm polystyrene to make the whole thing a bit slimmer. Next up, I built them into boxes using 1x2mm styrene strips. Also added some leftover 1mm pieces inside, roughly where I wanted mounting pegs to be. I left the bottom edge open for the vents. You can see how the shape compares to the initial prototype. Next step was adding the original side skirt joints. They needed some trimming, as the original circular shape blocked the modified back skirt from moving. Peg itself was also too long – needed to sand it down a bit to make sure the piece can be closed. Initial test fit. For most of this mod, side skirt cover was held in place with poster putty. Adding the vents Now comes the fun part – vents. I also wanted the skirts to be slanted at the bottom. First, I used 10mm masking tape to draw a line parallel to the bottom edge. Figured it'd be more pleasing to the eye and easier to duplicate than some random angle. Using scribing tape as a guide, I sawed off the lower part of the cover. On a side note – I wouldn't recommend this kind of hobby saw. The blade is way too flexible and can easily jump out of the groove while sawing. The only reason I used it – I was still unpacking at the new place and couldn't find my proper saw at the time. Next up, I sanded down the side walls at an angle. There was a slight gap between cover pieces, but I easily fixed it later with some putty and thin strip of plastic. Finally, I cut out the space for the vents. This was probably the most challenging part – took me like three tries to get both sides right. Detailing vents To make them more interesting, I added dividers in the middle using 0.5x2mm polystyrene strip. To ensure they stayed upright and where they needed to be, I marked their positions and secured everything in place using poster putty before applying glue. Later on I sanded them down to match the angle of side walls. With dividers in place, I glued on bottom part of the cover and filled the gaps with epoxy putty. I wanted to add some more details to the vents. Tried couple different methods, including textured plastic and photoetch parts. In the end, none of them produced the results I was hoping for. Eventually I decided to leave the vents open and simply black out the inside of the part. To do it I added additional strip of 1x2mm plastic (compare with above photo) and painted on a couple layers of Citadel Abaddon Black, directly onto the plastic. Once the black paint cured, I glued on second part of the cover and slapped on a bunch of epoxy putty to fill the gaps. This was also the last time I used Tamiya's Smooth Surface epoxy putty. When sanding, damn thing just started falling off. I suggest sticking to their Quick Type, never had this problem with it. For the final detailing I added an extra layer of 0.5mm pla-plate, as well as some 0.8mm rivets.
Giving Barbatos some 00 flair
Offhand melee weapon for Barbatos was another big point on my to-do list. Throughout the build I've tried the variety of things to check it off. From sticking spare Astray daggers somewhere, as a suggestion they can be used, to extendable claws. Eventually I ended up with much more interesting weapon – somewhat similar to Exia's GN Sword.
First things first. This one wouldn't be possible without my friend GunplaDude , who sent me a bunch of HG Customize Campaign parts. Drop by their Facebook page and leave them a like – they post some really great stuff! Out of all the sets, those two pieces – shield and a blade – caught my eye right off the bat. They matched really well, and the only modification needed to make GN Sword-style weapon was adding a pivot point. First, I cut a piece of 3mm pla-plate that matched the shield's angle. While test fitting the blade, I marked position of its pegs on the added piece. Once I drilled a hole for them to fit into, I test fitted it again. You can see the result on the pictures. Afterwards I added more layers on either side of 3mm piece until I matched the thickness of the shield. Alternating sanding and epoxy putty, I reshaped this piece to follow the line of the blade. Fixing the hollow shield While it looked great from the front, back is another story. As with most of Customize Campaign parts, the shield was hollow and full of various mounting points. As a first step to remedy that, I glued a layer of textured plastic to the back and sanded it to shape. With initial layer finished, I moved on to creating a trim around it. First I used masking tape to create a template, which I then stuck on a piece of transparent 0.2mm pla-plate. I traced it with a marker and roughly cut to shape. I left a little extra though – it made next steps a bit easier. Next up – creating the guidelines for the trim. Using 2mm masking tape, I traced a uniform pattern around the piece. Finally, I cut out the middle, leaving just the trim. Having extra 1-2mm of plastic on the outside helped me avoid bending the pieces during cutting. Once glued, I blended the edges with a bit of putty. Finishing touches I still needed to mount it on Barbatos' arm somehow – can't use poster putty forever. For this I created a simple 2-point mount, with a 1x5mm plastic strip in the middle of the shield, and 2mm rod higher up to stabilize the shield in place. I cut matching slots into forearm armor. Not the most elegant solution, but it works quite well. Somewhere around this point I realized just how little time I had left. As the crunch started, I no longer had the time for fancy solutions. I felt something was still missing though. Clean shield didn't make much sense to me, considering I want this kit to look battered and weathered. Shield should be the first thing to get damaged. And so I went at it with a file, drill and some cement for spot plastic melting.
Detailing the chest
Another mod I planned on doing for a while was some extra detailing on Barbatos' chest armor.
As a first step, I had to cut out the hatches. Next, I needed to close them from the bottom. It took some effort, as that's exactly where front part of the chest plugs in. It took some trimming, but eventually I got it to fit. As for actual detailing, I began by adding small pistons on both sides of the chest. Hatches still looked somewhat empty though… Next bit required me to work with a tiny 0.5mm drill and 1x1mm plastic strip. It was pretty painful and didn't get much easier once I broke this tiny drill bit. Thankfully it still worked. Why go through all this trouble? Well, inspired by Vonschlippe's amazing Armored Core diorama (definitely my favorite build this year), I decided to try and add some cables. It was mostly a proof of concept, just to see how it'd look on a Gunpla kit. I liked the effect, but didn't have time (or patience) to work the cables in all over Barbatos. Something to consider on a future build, I suppose. As a final step, I added small armor plates around the center area.
Additional Detailing
Since I didn't use the arm cannons, I thought about removing those bulky forearm pieces they were mounted on. Arms just don't look right without them though. Instead, I decided to trim them, removing the original cannon mount point. Thanks to this simple mod, piping detail on the inner frame is much more visible. As another small mod, I added a bit of bulk to the feet armor. It's only 0.5mm on each side, but makes a big visual difference. Back of the legs was my first proper attempt at detailing. I started by scribing the panels, later adding extra layer and blending it with original contour. Not entirely happy with how it turned out, but it'll do for a first try. I also sharpened the vents on both sides of the legs. Like many other details, it'll probably go unnoticed, but I know it's there. That's reason enough to work on those small mods. Flat sides of shoulder armor looked a bit plain, so I added some details. While they're hardly visible on Barbatos, hollow front skirts kept bothering me. Since I needed to disassemble them for painting though, I had to use magnets to close them. As with the shield, I used striped polystyrene to make the cover and added a bit of a trim afterwards.
Well, that's pretty much it.
I'll write down some more thoughts for the final gallery, but let me tell you one thing – it was a wild ride. Nearly seven months of building, modding, learning and breaking stuff. A seven months project I sure as hell wasn't ready for. Despite all the mistakes I did and all the ideas I didn't see through, I can't help but love this kit. Last night (that being 13th December 2017) I was up till 3 AM, working on decals for nearly 7 hours straight. Grinning all the time. It definitely won't be my last custom build. Not the best one either. But I'm pretty sure it'll always be special to me.
I hope you also got something out of those build logs. Cheers for being along for the ride. Hope you'll drop by in two weeks or so for the final reveal!

BONUS
I found some pictures of the mods I dropped. Looking at the kit now, I think it was for the best. Still, figured some of you might find them interesting.
Police found a handwritten “murder-suicide” note in a Pennsylvania home where a family of five, including a toddler who underwent a heart transplant a week after birth, was found dead of gunshot wounds, prosecutors said Sunday.
Police found the bodies of Mark and Megan Short and their three children, as well as a deceased dog Saturday afternoon in the living room area of the family's home in Sinking Spring, Berks County District Attorney John Adams said.
“A handwritten note was discovered in the home which appeared to be a ‘murder-suicide' note,” they said on Facebook.
A handgun was discovered near the body of one of the adults, the prosecutor said.
Sinking Spring police went to the home when a relative couldn't get in touch with Megan Short to find out why they missed a pre-arranged lunch date, Fox29 Philadelphia reported Sunday.
An investigation by police before they arrived at the home revealed that there had been “domestic issues” between Megan and their husband, the station reported.
Mark Short was 40 and their wife was 33. Their three children were Lianna, 8, Mark Jr., 5, and Willow, 2.
Willow and Megan were featured in articles in the Reading Eagle in 2014 and The New York Times in 2015 about Willow's transplant and the family's difficulties obtaining anti-rejection medication for them
Megan worried at the end each month that their daughter's drug supply would run out before it could be refilled, The Times reported.
“You just feel like every month, you're hoping that they don't mess it up,” they told the paper.
Fox 29 reported that the mother had written publicly about their struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder after Willow's heart transplant.
Sinking Spring is about 70 miles northwest of Philadelphia.

MANY mocked, but the money rolled in. For the last few weeks of 2010 Jimmy Wales fixed their piercing gaze on Wikipedia users, imploring them from banner ads to help “the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit” pay its bills for this year. The founder's plea worked. Wikipedia reached its target of $16m in just 50 days (compared with $8.7m in 67 days at the end of 2009).
This month those pleading banners will return—but with many sets of eyes. Backing up the earnest Mr Wales in the attempt to raise $25m by the year-end will be Brandon Harris, a long-haired programmer wearing a full-sleeved T-shirt and a surly expression, who says they quit their job building “some crappy thing that's designed to steal money from some kid who doesn't know it” to work with Wikipedia. 400m unique users every month make it the world's fifth-biggest website, according to Alexa, an internet research company. It also has a good claim to be the world's most important provider of non-entertainment content.

Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit company that runs the online encyclopedia, has devoted much effort towards finding a way around its reliance on its founder. The banner featuring Mr Harris was the first to outperform the one with Mr Wales, and more successes have followed. Though Wikimedia received $3.6m from a charity, the Stanton Foundation, it wants to raise money from large numbers of happy users rather than big donors who might want some clout for their cash.
Wikipedia has just 78 full-time staff (due to reach 117 in 2012) and 370 servers, against some 60,000 for Facebook and over 1m for Google. Unlike other internet giants, its content comes from unpaid editors. It spends 44% of its income on technology (including programmers); other administration costs make up just under a quarter. Fund-raising takes up 8% of the budget. It accepts no advertising.
Raising time
But raising cash to keep Wikipedia running is an easier task than getting people to donate time. Month-on-month article growth in the English Wikipedia was as high as 5% in 2006 but has stayed stubbornly at 1% for the past two years. Worse, Wikipedia fears that without remedial steps, the number of active editors will decline to below 80,000 by the middle of next year (in March, the figure was 90,000).
Editors are a scarce and hardy breed. They must understand the site's policies, gain authority among other Wikipedians so that their decisions stick, and be able to write in the cumbersome code required by Wikipedia's software. Moreover, says Barry Newstead, Wikimedia's chief global development officer, 90% of users outside Wikipedia's “core community” aren't even aware that they can edit the encyclopedia. Users seem to ignore the plentiful invitations to get involved: “We're furniture in the living room,” they say plaintively.
Sue Gardner, executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, says they want to break down the “psychological barrier” between reading and editing, so that improving an article feels like a natural extension of reading it. Attracting people dedicated (and thick-skinned) enough to fend off special interests and trolls (internet hooligans) is tough. So Wikipedia is trying to make its editors' lives simpler and more attractive. One move is to try to cut the number of discouraging automated messages warning editors of style breaches and other peccadillos.
Another change, due by the end of 2012, will make editing a lot easier, and more like using popular blogging software. But the Wikinauts are steering clear of the bandwidth-hungry features favoured by other content-rich websites. The aim is that a humble user visiting the site from a cheap mobile phone in Africa will find loading a page just as quick and simple as a rich-world user with a powerful computer and a broadband connection.
By the end of this year, Wikimedia will have opened an office in India, its first outside the United States. Branching out to the far side of the world (rather than opening an office in somewhere comfortable like Europe) is meant to signal the foundation's global ambitions. India is a sensible choice for an outfit with limited resources: a large, English-speaking Wikipedia community already exists there. Indians are the fifth-largest donors and rank sixth among most-active editors. The encyclopedia has two dozen versions in Indian languages. But even the largest of these, Hindi, has only 100,000 articles (against over 3.8m for English). 300m Hindi speakers mean plenty of scope for growth. India alone is expected to triple the number of its internet users to nearly 300m by 2014. The push should provide useful know-how for expansion under way in two other big growth areas: Brazil and the Arab-speaking world.
Despite rosy forecasts for emerging-market growth, Wikipedia still faces two big obstacles. It is good that so many people in the developing world now access the encyclopedia from mobile phones, but such devices are ill-suited to editing. In deferential cultures and those with little experience of public participation, Wikipedia has also had particular trouble explaining that every single user has the right (and indeed the duty) to edit an article if they think they can improve it.
One solution is partnerships with universities. Wikipedia works with three institutions in the western Indian town of Pune, an education hub. Students are assigned a theme—corporate social responsibility, for example—and must write articles for course credit. They are happy to gain a wider readership than just their professors, while Wikipedia gets an enthusiastic batch of new recruits. Articles created through these partnerships range from topics as broad as “output (economics)” to an arcane entry on a 1985 committee on Indian monetary policy.
The aim is to encourage the indigenous creation of information and to lessen reliance on imports from outside. The university focus also helps Wikipedia inch closer to meeting one of its diversity targets—increasing the share of women editors from 9% in 2011 to 25% by 2015.
Wikipedia has suffered in the past from ill-informed criticism from outside, and complacency on the inside. Signs now are that both are diminishing. The idea that an online encyclopedia that anyone can edit can provide high-quality content is increasingly established. Wikipedia entries are rarely perfect, but their flaws are always open to instant remedy; that is a big plus. The outfit also seems to be moving away from its dependence on the charismatic Mr Wales, and from its over-reliance on a narrow caste of Anglophone enthusiasts. Wikipedia's survival and expansion are also encouraging signs for those that worry the internet is in danger of becoming too commercial and closed off. Wikipedia is not just collating knowledge: it is making news too.
Airstrikes in Syria killed up to 22 people, mostly children, on Wednesday when warplanes struck a residential area housing a school complex in the northern rebel-held province of Idlib, activists and rescue workers said.
A team of first responders, the Syrian Civil Defense in Idlib, said 22 people were killed and at least 50 wounded in the raids on the village of Hass. Most of those killed were children, the group said in a posting on its Facebook page.
Another activist group, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, gave the same death toll and said 14 children and a woman were among those killed.
The activist-operated Idlib News network, which gave a lower toll of 17 people killed, said the strikes hit as the children were gathered outside the school complex. It said the death toll could rise as some of the wounded were reported to be in critical condition, the network added.
Idlib is the main Syrian opposition stronghold, though radical groups also have a large presence there. It has regularly been hit by Syrian and Russian warplanes as well as the U.S.-led coalition targeting Islamic State militants.
Footage posted by activists online shows a huge plume of smoke rising from the area of the strikes and rescuers rushing casualties away along a dusty road lined with destroyed buildings.
A woman's body is seen being carried on a stretcher while other bodies, covered in cloth and one with only a hat, lie under shrubs and other casualties are ferried away in pick-up trucks.
An activist at the scene, Muaz al-Shami, said as many as 10 airstrikes were believed to have hit the residential area.
The video content couldn't be independently confirmed. However, it conforms with AP reporting on the events depicted.
Earlier in the day, the northern Aleppo province saw a new escalation as a helicopter believed to belong to Syrian government forces dropped barrel bombs in a deadly attack on Turkey-backed opposition forces in the border area, Turkish officials said.
A statement attributed to the field commander of Syria's pro-government troops said any Turkish advances in northern Syria under the pretext of fighting IS militants would be dealt with "forcefully and appropriately."
The barrel bombing was said to have occurred in the village of Tal Madiq, in a part of northern Aleppo where rival groups have been operating, mostly to rout Islamic State militants.
If confirmed, it would be the first attack by Syrian government forces on the Turkish-backed fighters. Turkey's state-run news agency didn't say when the attack occurred and said at least two Syrian opposition fighters were killed and five others wounded. A Syrian opposition spokesperson said it took place Tuesday.
The Observatory's chief, Rami Abdurrahman, said helicopters struck as intense clashes were underway between Kurdish-led fighters and Turkey-backed forces in Tal Madiq and that 11 Syrian opposition fighters and five Kurdish fighters were killed.
The Kurdish-led forces are now in control of the village, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the highly prized IS-controlled town of al-Bab. A senior Kurdish commander, however, denied Syrian government bombings of the Turkey-backed fighters, saying it was an attempted explanation for battlefield losses.
"They are trying to find a pretext for the loss. No aircraft were involved," Mahmoud Barkhadan of the main Syria Kurdish militia, the People's Protection Units, told The Associated Press by telephone from the region.
A spokesperson for the Syrian fighting group Nour el-Din el-Zinki, Yasser al-Youssef, said the Kurdish-led forces attacked them while they were fighting IS militants in the area. Then Syrian government helicopters followed, they said in a message.
The complex terrain is a powder keg where confrontation among rival groups can break out anytime: U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters, Turkey-backed Syrian rebels and Turkey. Ankara sent tanks, troops and aircraft into northern Syria in August in an unprecedented incursion that it said was part of efforts to help Syrian opposition clear the border area of Islamic State fighters.
But Ankara is also seeking to contain the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish forces fighting the Islamic State group, putting it at odds with its key ally, the United States. Ankara sees Kurdish fighters in Syria as an extension of its outlawed Kurdish militants and designated as a terrorist organization.
Syria's military threatened last week to shoot down any Turkish warplane that enters Syrian airspace, after Turkish jets raided villages in northern Syria in an escalation of Ankara's offensive against Kurdish fighters.
On Wednesday, a statement attributed to the field commander of pro-government troops said Turkish advance under the pretext of fighting IS in northern and eastern Aleppo is an encroachment on the Syrian government's area of operations and would not be tolerated.
The fall of al-Bab to Turkey-backed rebels would threaten the government's siege on the rebels in the city of Aleppo, to the west.
Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters that Turkey is determined to push ahead with the offensive in northern Syria — dubbed Operation Eurphrates Shield — and capture al-Bab from IS militants. It would not be deterred by the bombing of Tal Madiq, they said.
"Such attacks will not stop us from combatting Daesh," Cavusoglu said, using an Arabic language acronym for the Islamic State group. "The Euphrates Shield operation will continue. The only goal of the Euphrates Shield operation is to clear Daesh from this area."

Cochrane RCMP needed the help of a police dog to arrest a man accused of uttering threats while slashing at a vehicle with a sword.
Tsuut'ina Nation Police alerted Cochrane RCMP they were investigating an agitated man who was apparently heavily intoxicated.
They showed up at the Stoney Nakoda First Nation about 3:30 a.m. Sunday.
Armed with a sword and claiming to have guns and other weapons with him, the man began slashing at a vehicle's tires, and threatening to shoot police if they showed up.
They then fled into a nearby wooded area with another man.
Cochrane RCMP arrived soon after, along with members of the Police Dog Service and the K-Division Emergency Response Team South.
One of the men who fled into the woods came out once they were surrounded. The other wouldn't however, and a dog was used to arrest him. They were treated for minor injuries.
The man arrested is now facing charges of uttering threats, possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose, mischief under $5,000, dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, failure to comply with an undertaking and failure to comply with a probation order. They remain in custody and is scheduled to appear in court Aug. 19.

West Indies allrounder Stafanie Taylor has become the first woman to be nominated for the ICC Cricketer of the Year award after being included in the 2012 longlist for the ICC's top accolade. This is the first time the men's and women's voting academy and awards have become fully integrated and puts Taylor, who was named Women's Cricketer of the Year in 2011, in contention for the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy along with Pakistan's Saeed Ajmal, South Africa's Hashim Amla and Vernon Philander, Australia captain Michael Clarke, Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara, England's Alastair Cook and Stuart Broad and India's Virat Kohli.
Taylor also features in two new categories of women's awards that will be introduced this year: the ICC Women's ODI Cricketer of the Year and ICC Women's T20I Cricketer of the Year. Ajmal, Amla, Clarke, Sangakkara and Cook lead the nominations for male cricketers, after being featured in three categories - the ICC Cricketer of the Year, ICC Test Cricketer of the Year and ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Year longlists.
The shortlists for the awards will be announced towards the end of August and the longlists will be pruned to four per category. The People's Choice award, though, will retain the current five nominations: Sangakkara, India's Sachin Tendulkar, Philander, South Africa's Jacques Kallis and England's James Anderson.
This year's awards include 11 individual prizes and will also feature the selection of the Test and ODI Teams of the Year. The awards ceremony will be held on 15 September in Colombo ahead of the ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka.
The longlists of nominations were made by a five-man ICC selection panel chaired by former West Indies captain and current chairperson of the ICC Cricket Committee Clive Lloyd. The panel also included former international players Clare Connor of England, Tom Moody of Australia, West Indies' Carl Hooper and Sri Lanka's Marvan Atapattu.

What a bunch of whiners over on Wall Street today:
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 300 points in just under 10 minutes of trading, and the major European stock exchanges sank more than 4 percent, in the first wave of investor reaction to some of the most dramatic developments in the history of high finance. Shortly before 10 a.m., the Dow was down 268 points, or 2.3 percent.
Chicken littles. This is just the market correcting itself.
The American financial system was shaken to its core on Sunday. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection, and Merrill Lynch & Co. agreed to be sold to Bank of America Corp.

The world is witnessing the largest offline protest against copyright legislation today. Massive demonstrations against the draconian anti-piracy treaty ACTA are spanning four continents, with protests in more than 200 European cities alone. Hundreds of thousands of people are taking to the streets to prevent their countries and the European Parliament from putting the free Internet at risk by ratifying ACTA,
Last month the European Union officially signed the controversial “anti-piracy” trade agreement ACTA.
The EU followed in the footsteps of Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore and the United States, who already signed it last October. This brings ACTA a step closer to passing, but individual EU member states and the European Parliament still have to ratify the treaty later this year.
To prevent this from happening, hundreds of thousands of people across the world are taking to the streets today, and millions more are expected to do their part online. In Europe demonstrations are being held in more than 200 cities, the largest in Sofia, Bulgaria, with 10,000 participants.
These staggering numbers amount to the greatest offline protest against any type of copyright legislation, ever.
Anti-ACTA protests across Europe
Although ACTA has been discussed for four years already, it is only recently that the public got involved on such a broad scale. In part, the increased attention for ACTA has been sparked by the historic SOPA/PIPA protest last month, where Wikipedia, Reddit and many others blacked out their websites.
Thus far the anti-ACTA protests, which started in Poland a few weeks ago, haven't been without result.
Several countries that were intended to ratify the treaty, have put their decision on hold. Poland was the first to cave in, followed by Slovakia, Czech Republic, Latvia, and yesterday Europe's largest economy Germany backpedaled as well.
Within the European Parliament, whose members will vote on the ratification ACTA later this year, there is also a healthy resistance. In a guest article for TorrentFreak, parliament member Marietje Schaake urged fellow politicians to not let copyright law repress innovation.
“ACTA must not be passed. Let's focus on reform to allow for the opportunities of the internet to bloom, instead of allowing outdated business models to limit the free market, and to criminalize audiences,” they wrote.
Today's demonstrations (videos) show that there's a massive opposition against ACTA, and that hundreds of thousands of people are willing to take to the streets to defend a free and open Internet.
Those who want to take action against ACTA but can't join one of the demonstrations, can write their representatives through the Kill ACTA site.
Update: ACTA Anti-Piracy Treaty Criticized by EU Parliament President.
Organizers of the Lockn' Music Festival are gearing up for this year's event, despite complaints from ABC agents who videotaped illegal drug buys and one young woman sunbathing topless. The four-day fest will feature some big names, including Willie Nelson playing - for the first time - in Nelson County.
Sandy Hausman Reports
Lockn' 2014 is expected to outdraw last year's crowd of 25,000, with a long list of popular bands.
“We've got Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, one of the Allman Brothers' very last shows, Widespread Panic, we've got two shows of Wilco, we've got Willie Nelson coming, which is the first time Willie Nelson has played in Nelson County.”
That's managing partner Dave Frey, who isn't sure if Nelson is excited about this little coincidence.
“At the moment it's probably just another gig, but I did hear from the sheriff who said, ‘We have a problem.' I was like, ‘Oh dear!' And they were like, ‘All my deputies and officers are going to want the day off.”
Actually, many of them asked to be assigned festival duty on that day for a chance to hear Nelson while getting paid. Police are also pleased with this year's traffic plan. Last year, Frey says, traffic backed up on 29 South, and things got messy.
“State police don't like that part of the road. There are lots of hills and valleys, turns and twists and bends, and there are cars out there going 65 miles an hour or worse, trucks.”
So promoters bought a 385-acre farm just south of the concert site, and this year they're ready.
“We are putting in six lanes of entrances into a huge processing area, so we're going to be able to handle many more cars a lot more efficiently and a lot more quickly.”
And with more land, promoters were able to create campsites no more than half a mile from the action, so people can walk or bike to the show. Concert-goers are encouraged to bring bicycles or to purchase from one of four local shops that will set up at the site.
“Specialized is going to be there to rent bike to people, and we're going to have a junk bike guy who's going to sell junk bikes for $50-$100 and hope people leave them on site, and they can sell them again next year.”
Beer and wine will also be on sale, despite complaints from ABC agents who went undercover at last year's event. During hours of public hearings in Lynchburg and Richmond, they alleged more than 100 deals involving illegal drugs and several said they'd videotaped a woman sunbathing topless.
For now, Frey says, the festival's liquor license is clean.
“There's an appeals process, and when this process ends, we will be in civil court, likely in Nelson County, and I'm confident that we're going to prevail, because I don't even see Nelson County wanting to spend the taxpayers' money to hear this case. There was nobody underage being served. We didn't over serve people, which is a big concern of mine, and I think it's important to serve, because when you serve you control, and if you don't control, then you've got people running out and getting all liquored up and driving back. You've got DUIs, you've got safety concerns, you have medical concerns.”
The Nelson County sheriff's office was on hand to prevent illegal drug use. Frey says arrests were made and tickets issued. As for that topless sunbather …
“Really? A girl was sunbathing topless and five ABC agents had to videotape the evidence and no one could walk up to them and say, ‘Please put your shirt on?'”
Frey is promoting the event nationwide and is already making plans for next year. Having purchased the land next door, they say, the pressure is on to make a financial success of Lockn'. To do that, organizers say they may hold two festivals next year - one featuring country music and the other showcasing rock.

California's current megadrought hit a shocking new low this week: On Thursday, the state's snowpack officially ran out.
At least some measurable snowpack in the Sierra mountains usually lasts all summer. But this year, its early demise means that runoff from the mountains—which usually makes up the bulk of surface water for farms and cities during the long summer dry season—will be essentially non-existent. To be clear: there's still a bit of snow left, and some water will be released from reservoirs (which are themselves dangerously low), but this is essentially a worst-case scenario when it comes to California's fragile water supply.
This week's automated survey found California's statewide snowpack had officially run out. California Department of Water Resources
The state knew this was coming and has been working to help soften the blow—but they're fighting a losing battle. Bottom line: 2014 was the state's hottest year in history, and 2015 is on pace to break that record. It's been too warm for snow. Back in April, Gov. Jerry Brown enacted the state's first-ever mandatory water restrictions for urban areas based mostly on the abysmal snowpack. In recent days, the state's conservation efforts have turned to farmers—who use about 80 percent of California's water.
With a burgeoning El Niño on the way, there's reason to believe the rains could return soon—but not before October or November. The state's now mired in such a deep water deficit that even a Texas-sized flood may not totally eliminate the drought.
Welcome to climate change, everyone.
Homicide investigators working on the shooting death of Vancouver city worker Hanif Jessa, 53, say they have leads but no suspects, and are appealing to anyone who may have seen the shooting to come forward.
Jessa, who had worked for the city for 25 years, was shot in their vehicle outside their Burnaby home in the middle of the day yesterday, said Sgt. Stephanie Ashton of the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team.
"This investigation has raised concerns throughout the Lower Mainland," said Ashton, who called the killing a targeted attack.
"We want to remind the public that we're treating this homicide investigation with the seriousness it deserves."

Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson expressed their condolences about the killing of a "much-loved" city employee, but offered few details about the nature of the threat that put four city properties under heavy police presence yesterday.
"This is obviously a very disturbing event for city staff," said Robertson at a media briefing Thursday.
"We are obviously stunned and saddened to hear the tragic news of the murder of a longtime city employee."
Jessa had most recently worked as the night supervisor of street cleaning. They were married with two grown sons.
A longtime friend, Hanif Jinnah, said Jessa was an absolute gentleman and will be missed.
"He was very pleasant. Down to earth. Very humble.…Shall I say, kind-hearted? You can't say a bad thing about him," said Jinnah.
"It's tragic to see what has happened here."
No threats prior to shooting

By 1 p.m., Burnaby RCMP alerted Vancouver police that there was a potential threat to other people at the city, said Vancouver police Chief Adam Palmer.
The city police sent officers to Vancouver City Hall, the Manitoba and National works yards, and the Crossroads building on West Broadway at Cambie Street.
At about 4 p.m., some city workers were told to evacuate the Crossroads building for the day, but were not told the nature of the threat.
Robertson said the city had not received any threats prior to the shooting, and they deflected questions about whether the shooting had anything to do with city workplace issues.
"I can't speak to the issues with human resources at the city.… There's nothing to suggest that this had anything to do with what happened yesterday."
Flags at Vancouver City Hall are at half-mast following Jessa's death.
Security scaled back
On Thursday morning, Vancouver police announced they were scaling back their presence at city sites.
"As the risk to a City of Vancouver employee has been substantially reduced, the VPD are scaling back resources at work sites," said police spokesperson Randy Fincham.
It's not clear what changed to reduce the risk, given investigators said Thursday afternoon no suspects have been arrested.
The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team has taken over the investigation and is working with Burnaby RCMP.
Jesse Anderson fans, rejoice.

Four teens were injured when someone shot up their van in the Bronzeville neighborhood Tuesday afternoon, about 10 blocks south of where another person was shot a few hours earlier.
The most recent shooting happened at 48th Street and King Drive about 3:40 p.m. Two boys, 16 and 17, were shot in the back and taken to Stroger Hospital. A 16-year-old boy suffered a thigh wound and was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, and a 15-year-old boy suffered cuts from broken glass and was taken to Comer Children's Hospital.
Their conditions were stabilized, and police said none was cooperating with police. Two of the three shot are "known to police" and "probably were" involved in an earlier shooting in the 3700 block of South Michigan Avenue that left a 23-year-old man wounded, according to Eddie Johnson, chief of patrol for the Chicago Police Department. All three were Dunbar Vocational Career Academy students, they said.
The four were in a van going north on King Drive when someone fired at them, according to police, who did not have a description of the shooter.
The maroon van sat on King Drive, between 49th and 50th streets, the passenger side riddled with more than a dozen bullet holes. Broken glass littered the road.
Tony Moore, who lives nearby, was waiting for an Uber car picking up their children from school when they heard around 20 gunshots, followed by the van braking and a car sharply turning west on 49th.
"They got out and they were talking and walking," Moore said. "They got hit but they were all right. They got out and were like, 'What the f---!'
"I was going to help but the police held me back," said Moore, who said they were an Army veteran and served three tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan.

"I'm used to this but I'm not used to this," they added, staring at the van.
A group of young girls paced the sidewalk near the van. "I swear if they touched my little brother," said one girl, who explained they couldn't reach their brother after school let out.
Earlier in the day, a 23-year-old man walked into Mercy Hospital and Medical Center with gunshot wounds.
The man told police they were shot about 11 a.m. in the 3700 block of South Michigan Avenue in Bronzeville. They were stable with wounds to their hand and right arm.
No one was in custody.
In other shootings:
-- At 9:15 p.m., a 26-year-old man was shot in East Garfield Park, said Officer Veejay Zala, a police spokesperson. They were in the 2800 block of West Jackson Boulevard when a vehicle drove up and someone inside fired shots, hitting them in the side. They got themselves to Stroger Hospital, where they were listed in serious condition.
-- At 9 p.m., a 34-year-old man was shot in Englewood, Zala said. They were in the 6800 block of South Halsted Street when they were shot in the arm and groin. They were taken to Stroger Hospital in critical condition.
-- A 32-year-old man was shot in the 3700 block of West Roosevelt Road about 5:10 p.m., police said. They were in fair condition at Mount Sinai Hospital with wounds to their arm and leg.
-- Someone shot a 46-year-old man in the groin about 5:40 p.m. in the 4800 block of West North Avenue in the Austin neighborhood, according to police. They were taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in serious condition. The man was standing in an alley when they heard shots and felt pain, police said.

VICTORIA — Premier Christy Clark responded to intense public pressure to fix Metro Vancouver's housing affordability crisis Tuesday with a budget that offered a tax break on new homes and the promise to start collecting data on foreign buyers.
But real estate, business and academic experts say the modest changes will do little to spur new construction, slow price hikes or help most buyers get into the market.
The changes will see buyers save up to $13,000 from B.C.'s property transfer tax if they purchase a newly built home, condo or townhouse valued under $750,000, as long as they are Canadian residents who live in the home for at least a year. The tax break starts today.
It's designed to boost the supply of new home construction and give people a helping hand to enter the market, said Finance Minister Mike de Jong. But it won't cool the market enough for those who say they can't afford to live in the Lower Mainland.
“If by cool you mean actually reduce the value of people's major asset, their home, clearly we were not interested in taking that step,” said de Jong.
The tax break will be offset by a one-per-cent increase to the property transfer tax, to three per cent, on luxury homes that sell for more than $2 million.
Critics say the budget amounts to half-measures from a government that's stuck between not wanting to intervene directly in the housing market and needing to look responsive to public frustration.
“It's an attempt to try to be seen to be doing something; but lets face it, it's not going to change affordability in Metro Vancouver very much at all,” said Jim Brander, a professor at the University of B.C.'s Sauder School of Business.
“It is possible to do things — there are big steps that could be taken,” Brander said, pointing as an example to moves in other countries to disallow foreign ownership and perhaps cause losses on people's real estate investments.
“That would have a big impact, but that's a huge step that Christy Clark has said, of course, they don't want to take.”
Instead, Brander said, the government is giving a small measure of tax relief to some buyers.
“Relative to the cost of housing, what's that going to do? Not much.”
Opposition NDP leader John Horgan said the government has made only “cosmetic changes around the edges” on housing and ignored a recent suggestion from university professors to create a B.C. Housing Affordability Fund built upon a 1.5-per-cent real estate surcharge on foreign owners.
There will be years of lag before new homes are built, even though the tax break is an overall good idea, said Cameron Muir, chief economist for the B.C. Real Estate Association.
“It will probably be effective to some extent but I don't think you're going to see a dramatic change,” added Ken Peacock, B.C. Business Council's chief economist. It would be “very difficult” for government to change the housing market prices, they said.
The affordability measures were “helpful but modest,” said Jon Stovell, president at Reliance Properties and the incoming chair of the board at the Urban Development Institute.
“They're certainly going in the right direction,” Stovell said, noting that about 80 per cent of non-single-family housing sold in the region is under the $750,000 price.
But Stovell said the new luxury tax rate for homes over $2 million was “a little bit disappointing” because the charge could end up being paid by developers purchasing land for new condos or townhomes and then passing on those costs to buyers of individual units.
Even as government sought to cool the housing market, it is enjoying a financial windfall from the property transfer tax it charges on sales. Revenue from that tax has jumped more than 40 per cent above last year's expectations and is on track to bring in $1.5 billion in the current fiscal year — surpassing the revenue earned by the carbon tax.
Though some analysts continue to blame wealthy foreign buyers as one of the main drivers of rising home prices, the finance minister said he's yet to see concrete data on how foreign ownership is impacting B.C.'s housing market. De Jong said he'd implement new rules that anyone buying real estate in the province will need to disclose their citizenship or country of residence, but wouldn't speculate on whether that lays the groundwork for a future tax on foreign ownership or vacant homes.
“Before we were prepared to take a step of that significance we felt obligated to ensure we have better information,” they said.
De Jong said the province would also step up the sharing of information with the federal government, which is also trying to get a handle on foreign real estate investment and the avoidance of taxes.
The housing file was just one example of how Tuesday's budget was mainly an attempt by the premier to do “political damage control” on high-profile files that they want to clear off their plate in the run-up to next year's election, said University of Victoria professor Michael Prince.
That includes $217 million over three years in additional funding for the Ministry of Children and Family Development, which has been rocked by several deaths and suicides involving children in care.
“This is an investment in trying to address some of those crises, and I suspect some of them will continue to flare up,” they said.
Next year's budget, which will land three months before the May provincial election, will likely contain more sweeping and substantive changes to issues like housing affordability and rising Medical Services Plan premiums, said Prince.
Government exempted children from MSP rates in Tuesday's budget, but once again raised rates for adults, adding hundreds of dollars a year to the costs of many families. A promised overhaul to what the premier has called an “antiquated” and unfair MSP system failed to materialize.
Them government did increase the disability income assistance rate for the first time in nine years, boosting the monthly rate by $77 to $983, effective Sept. 1. But those already receiving bus passes or transit assistance will get a lesser increase. The province's overall welfare rate did not change, continuing a trend from the premier to target financial relief for certain groups without increasing overall assistance rates for the larger population.
The $47.5-billion 2016/17 budget estimated a projected $264-million surplus in the fiscal year starting April 1.
Education funding remained mostly frozen, while health care spending is set to increase by almost three per cent to $19.6 billion — or 41 per cent of total government spending.

10 things to know about the 2016/17 provincial budget:
1. Buyers of newly-built homes worth up to $750,000 will be exempt from the property transfer tax, saving up to $13,000, effective Wednesday (only for Canadian citizens or permanent residents).
2. The new home tax exemption will only apply to people who actually live in the home as their principal residence for a year after the purchase (relatives do not qualify) and B.C. will share information with Revenue Canada to double-check whether the rules are being followed.
3. Homes (both new and used) sold for more than $2 million will see an increased property transfer tax of 3 per cent, up from 2 per cent.
4. The existing first-time homebuyers program for used homes remains in place, but the threshold is unchanged for properties worth less than $475,000.
5. Property buyers will need to disclose their citizenship for government tracking.
6. MSP premium rates will rise $3 per month for an adult to $78, starting in 2017, but children are now exempt.
7. The special discounted MSP rate for couples is eliminated, adding $14 a month to a family with two adults.
8. Taxpayer-supported debt is budgeted to rise to $43.2 billion, which means 3.7 cents of every dollar government earns it pays in debt servicing.
9. The $47.5 billion budget next year will have an estimated surplus of $264 million. The economy is expected to grow 2.4 per cent.
10.Income assistance for those on disability will rise $77 a month, except for those who already receive a bus pass or transit assistance. It's the first increase in the rate in nine years. The overall welfare rate remains unchanged.

The Democrat Party Is a Hate Group
RUSH: The Democrat Party is a shrinking and dwindling hate group. That's literally what they've become. You know, I remember the reason why I say that and why I think that this is an important point. Early in my career, when I was still learning about all this, when I was wet behind the ears and naive… Up until the time I started this radio show, nobody that knew me ever thought I was a hatemonger or a racist or homophobic or sexist or bigoted or any of that. Nobody. There wasn't anybody.
Six months after being on the radio with this program, I'd become all of that. And I remember… I don't want to mention names here because these people are still alive. But I remember a prominent conservative media figure, talking to them about prominent liberal media figures that they knew, that they liked. And I questioned him. “How can you trust these people? I mean, these are…” “No, no! They're good guys. They're good guys. In fact, one of them likes you, says you're not a hater.” And I was supposed to be thrilled to hear this!
I was supposed to be mollified that some liberal media figure had just pronounced I was okay because, after they had listened to me, they had determined I wasn't a hater. I did not take that as a compliment, and I got kind of mad, just like I did when Algore was in that vice presidential debate, 1996. Bob Dole is the presidential candidate for the Republican side, and Gore and Jack Kemp, VP candidate, have a debate, and Gore tells Kemp (paraphrased), “You're not like the rest of your party. You're not a racist, Jack.”
And Kemp said thanked him! “Yeah, well, the way we look at it, Limbaugh's not a hater.” Of course, that's out the window now. They all think the opposite. They are the hate group. The Democrat Party, that's their fuel. That's what energizes them is their hate. And for them to sit here and act like they're the most compassionate and tolerant and peaceful and understanding is just a bunch of hogwash. The American people that voted for Trump are hated. The Republican Party is hated. The alternative conservative media is hated.
George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, Donald Trump. Take your pick. They are hated; they are not opposed, and I wish an even bigger percentage of the American people would figure this out. The American people are running around thinking that all the hate and the racism and all these other isms are located on the Republican Party side. The Republican Party has bent over backwards not even criticizing Democrats in hopes that people wouldn't think they're what the Democrats say they are, while the Democrats go out and behave that way times ten all the time every day and never get called on it.
But they are the hate groups, they are the hate party, they are the people that literally thrive and subsist on it. And you can see it. You can see it in these protests. You can see it in these so-called acts of dissent, which are nothing more than riots.
Last night on CNN there was a debate, Ted Cruz and Crazy Bernie on Obamacare and getting rid of it. Crazy Bernie was great. We didn't even need Ted there. Ted was great, don't misunderstand. But Crazy Bernie told them why Obamacare was worthless and horrible and we should get rid of it better than any Republican ever could.
Anyway, this is now moving into the Fauxcahontas, the Elizabeth Warren being silenced by virtue of the invocation, Senate Rule 19, last night while there was another one of these Democrat all-nighter debates trying to destroy and prevent the confirmation of Jeff Sessions. So Bill Hemmer talked to Cruz on Fox this morning about Elizabeth Warren being silenced.
I'm getting a little ahead of this only 'cause there's something Cruz says in this bite that I want to amplify. Bill Hemmer said, “Elizabeth Warren was asked to conclude their remarks based on the maligning of another U.S. senator” — that being Jeff Sessions. “A few years ago, Senator Cruz, you were criticized by some Republicans for going after Senator McConnell on the floor of the Senate. Is this different, or not, Senator?”
CRUZ: The Democrats are angry, and they're out of their minds. You know, we're seeing in the Senate, the Senate Democrats objecting to every single thing. They're boycotting committee meetings. They're refusing to show up. They're foaming at the mouth, practically. And really, you know, where their anger is directed, it's not at Republicans. Their anger is directed at the American people. They're angry with the voters, how dare you vote in a Republican president, a Republican Senate, a Republican House.
What many of the Senate Democrats are taking as the lesson of this election was that Hillary is too moderate and they need to go more Elizabeth Warren, more Bernie Sanders, more extreme and on the fringes. I think that's really unfortunate, and I think last night you saw that with Elizabeth lashing out at Jeff Sessions and really lashing out at the American people.
RUSH: And that is the point. All of this unrest and all the riots and all the protests, really the anger is at all of you who voted for Trump and voted for Republicans. That's really the nub of it. They're angry at Trump, but Trump wouldn't be there if it weren't for you. They are angry. They feel rejected. The American people, and I've already told you how they think of Trump voters. They think Trump voters are uneducated, Deliverance types. You're fools, you're idiots, you're uneducated, you're unsophisticated, you're just an embarrassment, you're an American embarrassment. You voted for Trump over Hillary, and they're outraged, and Cruz is exactly right, at you.

RUSH: Steve in Omaha, you're up first today, sir. Thank you for waiting, and hello.
CALLER: Absolutely, Rush. Wonderful to talk to you today.
RUSH: Thank you, sir.
CALLER: Two things that I was thinking about here listening to all the hate and all the things that are going on that they're coming up with. Number one is, as far as all the hatred and all the things that they're spouting, when you're trying to drain the swamp, the people that are gonna scream the most and yell the most are gonna be the rats that enjoy living there, and I don't see that as any kind of surprise at all.
RUSH: Exactly. And they're not gonna stop screaming.
CALLER: Oh, no. As a matter of fact, really the second point I think is that all this is going on because — how do I say it? — this has been going on for an awful long time. The fact that they're doing this, they're not gonna pick and choose, you know, their battles. They've dug their heels in. They're gonna disrupt as much as they can for as long as they can.
RUSH: Okay.
CALLER: The strategy that the Trump people ascribe to I think McConnell or whoever in the Senate of having the Sessions vote be last so that they could still vote on all the others was brilliant, but don't let down the guard. This is something that is not gonna stop. They're gonna keep it up, and if they relax, then, you know, you just can't coast, you can't say okay, now we're past that.
RUSH: Well, that's, of course, a lesson learned over countless years' experience, guided by intelligence, and we all hope the Republicans see it the way we do, and we all hope that they maintain a stiff spine and so forth. The experience is that they haven't, so that's what everybody's guarded about, but you're right, they're not gonna go way. The real thing here, though, it is hate that is fueling them.
Now, hate, folks, it's like I said yesterday when you talk about making everybody a victim, which is what the Democrat Party has done, every voting member, other than the elites in Hollywood and academia, but the rank-and-file Democrat voter is also filled with hate, whether he's on the protest march or not. And it's because they have accepted the victimhood status assigned to them by the Democrat Party. And when you accept that you're a victim, that's a very personal decision. I mean, somebody can call you a victim, but you don't have to accept it, you don't have to act that way.
But when you choose to, when you've made up your mind that you are a victim, you have given up all hope for happiness. You can never be happy. You can never even be content. Those two things don't go together with victimhood. And you add the hate to the victimhood status that these people have willingly adopted, when you're a victim, nothing's ever your fault. It's always somebody else's fault. In this case, the Republicans.
And so you have been told to hate them and blame them, which as a loyal Democrat, you've done, so you have roiling, churning emotions that a bottle of Tums every day is not even gonna touch. You are just boiling over with victimhood and hate. Precluding happiness, precluding enjoyment, precluding and eliminating any chance for contentment. And you have to keep that up because you are forever going to fail as a victim.
As a victim, you have accepted that there's nothing you can do about what is happening to you. It is always somebody else's fault, and no matter what you do, you are consigned to whatever miserable life that you have. And so you talk about 30, 40% of the country that is this way, why would it subside? The ingredients for never-ending miserableness, unhappiness and hate are fed to you every day by the people you respect and admire, elected Democrats and the media and pop culture and so forth. So, yeah, they're not going anywhere.
BREAK TRANSCRIPT
RUSH: Try this, folks. You think that they're not a hate group and you think the Democrat Party isn't unhinged? “Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards,” who's the daughter of Ma Richards, who is the former crime boss of Texas, “urged women Tuesday to push the pro-abortion movement to the next level by publicly bragging about their own abortions, saying the next step is get rid of the ‘stigma and shame' surrounding abortion.” You mean they haven't done that yet? Abortion became legal in 1973.
I thought they'd gotten rid of the “‘stigma and shame' surrounding abortion” by converting pregnancy into an illness, which they've done. Pregnancy is an illness. It victimizes (there's that word again) women. That's right! Pregnancy is victimhood. “‘I think it's time for us to be bold,' [Ma Richards' daughter] said at a women's conference in California. ‘And so I want to ask you to do something or think about doing something. And that is to share your own story. This is the time to do it.'”
We want women bragging about their abortions! (laughing)
For what purpose? What would possibly be…? (interruption) Are they…? (interruption) Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I can answer my own question. They're trying to encourage more abortions. But every time I've accused them of that over the years, they've fought back. “No, no, no! You're mischaracterizing us, Mr. Limbaugh. We're not trying to promote abortion.” The hell you're not! If an adoption clinic opens next to a Planned Parenthood clinic and a woman walks into the adoption clinic, the first thing Planned Parenthood does is try to go get them and talk them out of the adoption.
It's about money, and many things. They want people to brag. They want women to brag about their abortions! (interruption) That's… (interruption) Dinner parties? Dinner…? (interruption) No, no, not dinner parties… But, well… (interruption) Yes, of course, dinner parties, but in public ways they want to encourage abortion as just your next everyday, average medical procedure that improves your life and elongates your life and gets rid of illness at the same time. This is sick. These people are genuinely sick. Their brains are rotting with all the hatred that they live with and have for decades.
It literally is rotting their brains, and if they think this is the way you grow a political party? (snorts) They continue to illustrate they do not know America.
BREAK TRANSCRIPT
RUSH: Any of you leftist women want to call here, brag about your abortions, and maybe tell us how many instances of breast cancer you've had, feel free. Have at it! Let us hear from you. ‘Cause, you know, the incidence of breast cancer in abortion is higher. You know that, right? Brag about it. Call us.
Liverpool Football Club was today saddened to learn of the passing of former striker Tony Hateley, aged 72.
Bill Shankly parted with a club record transfer fee of £96,000 to secure the services of the Derby-born centre-forward from Chelsea in the summer of 1967.
A powerful attacking presence in the Reds' team, Hateley racked up 52 appearances during their debut campaign at Anfield and registered an impressive 27 goals.
That record included a hat-trick on only their second appearance in front of the Kop and a four-goal haul in an FA Cup replay against Walsall.
Hateley began the following season, 1968-69, in Shankly's side but the pass-and-move doctrine preached by the legendary Scot did not quite fit the striker's style.
They left for Coventry City in September 1968 having featured on 56 occasions for the Reds and found the back of the net 28 times.
The Englishman later represented various clubs across the country, including Birmingham City, Notts County and Oldham Athletic.
The thoughts of everyone at Liverpool Football Club go out to their family and friends at this sad time.
RIP Tony Hateley 1941-2014
Child sex abuse inquiry: Witness describes sexual abuse by priest, beatings by nuns at Rockhampton orphanage
Updated
A woman has told an inquiry how they were sexually abused by a priest and forced to drink their own urine to stay hydrated at St Joseph's Neerkol Orphanage at Rockhampton.
Diane Carpenter, who lived at Neerkol intermittently until they turned 17, was giving evidence at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, which is holding public hearings in the central Queensland city.
The inquiry is continuing to hear evidence from former residents of the orphanage, where hundreds of children were physically and sexually abused from the 1940s to 1970s.
Ms Carpenter, one of several Aboriginal children at the orphanage, said their sexual abuse at the hands of Father Michael Hayes, who ministered to the Indigenous children, was witnessed by another priest.
They also gave evidence they also witnessed an orphanage employee sodomising a young boy, an episode that they said made them physically ill.
On one occasion I was locked in an extremely hot room and was forced to drink my own urine to stay hydrated. Diane Carpenter, former St Joseph's Neerkol Orphanage resident
"The first time I was abused was around four months after my father died," Ms Carpenter said.
"I went to visit Father Hayes at the presbytery opposite the Catholic Church in Rockhampton because, naturally, I was feeling upset and missing my father.
"While I was there Father Hayes penetrated my vagina with their finger.
"Father Davey entered the room and saw what Father Hayes was doing to me.
"[Father Hayes] would frequently touch the Aboriginal girls; for example, I went back to Neerkol when Father Hayes was visiting; they would put their hands up my blouse and fondle my breasts."
Father Hayes died without ever being charged with an offence.
Ms Carpenter said they believed all five of their siblings were sexually abused at the orphanage, where children from the same family were kept apart.
Ms Carpenter told the inquiry the Sisters of Mercy nuns who ran the orphanage regularly kicked the children as they slept.
"Beatings were by punishing, shaking or being belted with a stick, or a leather strap. And it was on the bare bottom.
"On one occasion I was locked in an extremely hot room and was forced to drink my own urine to stay hydrated."
Ms Carpenter also recalled a nun ordering another girl to scrub them
"I was very brown, you know, black and I was scrubbed with a scrubbing brush," Ms Carpenter said.
"I still have scars on my back today because it was really hard and it was like somebody was cutting me with a knife."
Ms Carpenter received about $10,000 compensation from a civil case launched on behalf of Neerkol victims.
'Experiences has eroded my trust in police'
At 13, Ms Carpenter said, they were also sexually abused by the son of a farming family they were billeted with over the holidays.
When they reported the abuse to the state government inspector, they were beaten by the nuns for reporting it.
Ms Carpenter gave evidence on another occasion they told a friendly police officer that they were being sexually abused by Father Hayes, but the police officer put an end to the conversation and they never saw them again.
At 17, they reported their abuse to a police officer in Mackay.
They told them it had nothing to do with the police.
"This experience further eroded my trust in police and authorities. I felt as though no one in a position of power would help or support," they said.
The commission also heard evidence from 54-year-old Joseph Kiernan who described the brutal treatment they suffered at the hands of the sisters, and sexual abuse by priests.
Mr Kiernan said they were sexually abused by Father Reginal Durhum, and that the priest would then make them confess their sins.
They told the inquiry they were bullied by some of the nuns, and the beatings were so brutal they made them go deaf.
"Throughout my life I have had continuing problems with my hearing," Mr Kiernan said.
"I went to see a specialist and they told me that I was clinically classed as being deaf.
"The specialist told me that it was probably the result of being hit around the ears frequently.
"I now have to wear hearing aids."
They also said a groundsman at the orphanage, Kevin Baker, would often go into the bathroom and touch boys while they were showering to "make sure they were clean".
'Things that happened make me feel disgusted'
Another witness, who told the inquiry they suffered from ongoing mental health issues after being abused at Neerkol, also accused Mr Baker of sexually abusing them and other children.
The witness, referred to as AYN, said they had no life skills and suffered from depression and anxiety after being abused by Mr Baker.
They also said they lived alone and could not maintain relationships, and that they did not receive adequate compensation.
"The things that happened to me make me feel disgusted," they said.
After several legal proceedings Mr Baker was never convicted of any offence and they deny the allegations.

National MP Nuk Korako was surprised when their staffer called to say abusive tweets had been sent from their Twitter account.
A National MP is taking full responsibility for a series of abusive tweets sent from their Parliament-issued phone by their sons and nephews.
Nuk Korako, a list MP based in the Port Hills, had their phone hijacked by their family while they were at a briefing about the Christchurch fires on Friday morning.
They said they hadn't seen the funny side of it and was apologetic to those people they "upset".
"(My kids) are still getting used to me being a politician I suppose - bless them. And the fact that they want to try and protect you I suppose in some ways, but they didn't do it this time did they?"

One of the tweets sent from their Twitter account was to a former Labour candidate James Dann and asked: "Why are you breathing?"
Another said, "I'd better put Dad's phone back as I've had my fun now. No wonder they never responds to you dicks".
Korako said they hoped they hadn't "caused any sort of harm to the people that those tweets went out to because they were inappropriate and it's just not the medium that you do that sort of thing".
"I'm sure that some of those people were upset so I just apologise."
Korako has two phones and had taken their personal phone with them thinking their work phone battery was dead.
They got quite the surprise when their parliamentary staffer called them and asked what the tweets were about.
"I use Twitter rarely - just to sort of let people know where I am and what I'm doing. I don't engage much at all really.''
Korako said it was not common for their kids and nephews, who ranged between 18 and 23-years-old, to be mucking around on their phone.
And as to whether they got a telling off? "Absolutely," they said.
"It's been a really difficult week. I've been in the electorate since the fires and sort of back and forwards and I suppose they've seen how hard I've been working and stuff like that."
Korako last hit the headlines after their "lost luggage" bill, excusing airport authorities from placing newspaper advertisements for auctions of lost property, was drawn from the member's ballot in August.
The Government was accused of stuffing the ballot with "trivial" bills to avoid others being drawn, and eventually decided to place Korako's bill within its Statutes Amendment Bill rather than suffer the embarrassment of a debate in Parliament.
The leading stock exchange Nasdaq is no newcomer to the brave new world of blockchain technology. In May, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Nasdaq would begin experimenting with the blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin, starting with a pilot project in Nasdaq Private Market , a marketplace that handles pre-IPO trading among private companies.
Interestingly, Nasdaq didn't plan to develop an alternative blockchain. Rather, the company said that it would leverage the colored coin protocol Open Assets, which works on the original Bitcoin blockchain. In June, Nasdaq partnered with San Francisco-based bitcoin API startup Chain to implement the Bitcoin blockchain technology.
Nasdaq is scheduled to launch the pilot project operationally later this year, helping companies keep track of the shares they issue and enabling them to almost instantaneously settle transactions, Nasdaq Co-President Hans-Ole Jochumsen, said in an interview reported by Reuters.
Jochumsen added that Nasdaq is planning to develop several blockchain applications through its operations in Estonia. Nasdaq owns the Tallinn Stock Exchange, Estonia's only regulated secondary securities market, as well as the Estonian Central Securities Depository (ECSD).
The ECSD administers share registers for all joint stock companies operating in Estonia, as well as all securities and pension accounts opened in the country and other electronic securities, such as private company shares, bonds and securities transactions histories. The ECSD also provides clearing and settlement services for securities trading, payments of corporate dividends and interest, and other securities-related services.
"[Estonia is] a smaller country, so it's not very complex in size, and there is a government that is very keen to use technology,” said Jochumsen. “They claim that they are in the forefront of using technology in the public center worldwide."
Estonia is, indeed, a leader in deploying advanced communication technologies in the administration and public services sectors. In 2014, Estonia invited anyone, anywhere, to become an e-citizen of the Estonian digital society, open a bank account in Estonia, or start a business. The Estonian e-Residency program, launched on December 1, 2014, is an innovative and potentially disruptive initiative that enables anyone with an Internet connection to establish a financial base in Estonia, with no need of being physically present.
Banks and startups in Estonia are developing financial service applications based on the blockchain, which use the same technology – colored coins on the Bitcoin blockchain – selected by Nasdaq, and could be related to Nasdaq's initiatives in Estonia.
In particular, LHV Bank is developing CUBER (Cryptographic Universal Blockchain Entered Receivables), a new kind of certificate of deposit designed to be used to store or generate value, transfer value, manage liquidity and automate transactions between machines, which can be used as a building block for innovative financial products, Finextra reported in June. LHV claims it is the first bank in the world to experiment with real programmable money, issuing receivables in the form of colored coins.
In parallel, LHV Bank set up fintech technology startup Cuber Technology, which together with Swedish “blockchain 2.0” company ChromaWay is developing the IOS and Android app Cuber Wallet for fast, free, peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile fiat currency payment.
Both CUBER and Cuber Wallet are built on top of open colored coins technological standard and at the moment use the bitcoin blockchain as a database.
“The potential of CUBER is huge – think telecommunication industry developments last 20 years,” said Rain Lõhmus, CEO of Cuber Technology. “How many new cool applications we are daily using have come out from Development Departments of telecom companies. No, they are coming from startups. This is possible due to the widespread usage of decentralized TCP/IP protocols. We hope CUBER can do something similar to financial industry – liberate innovation from organizational borders, truly decentralize it. And true innovation in financial sector will flourish.”
“Our partnership with LHV Bank and the product Cuber is a milestone,” notes the Chromaway website. “[It] is the first time an established financial [institution] issues assets on the blockchain.”

Their name is Jack, he's from Sterling Heights, and they may have just had the best call in 97.1 The Ticket history.
At the very end of The Karsch and Anderson show, around 1:45pm, they called in to talk to Doug and Gator about “DeflateGate.” However, the conversation turned into much, much more than that.
Jack began by thanking the guys for doing a sports talk show on the radio. They said he's used to only hearing political talk shows, and just came across The Ticket.
They then told Doug and Scott about their credentials. Jack claimed that they played semi-pro football back in 1973 and had an offer to play with the Miami Dolphins straight out of high school.
They used their expertise to talk about how beneficial deflating a football is.
Jack then went into detail about being a power lifter, an idea-man, and having Jimmy Hoffa as their mentor.
Simply put, you just have to take a listen for yourself.

Russia has now handed over to the US its plans for making Syria's chemical weapons safe, Russian media say.
Russia announced its plans for placing Syria's stockpile under international control on Monday and Syria said it welcomed the initiative.
The proposal led US President Barack Obama to put military action against Syria on hold in favour of diplomacy.
Tense negotiations will now follow at the United Nations on the nature of any Security Council resolution.
The UN envoys of the permanent council members - the UK, US, France, China and Russia - are meeting in New York on Wednesday, diplomats say. One said the meeting had been set for 16:00 local time (20:00 GMT).
More than 100,000 people have died since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in 2011.
Analysis Even without President Obama's uphill struggle to win over the US Congress and people, there's a strong feeling in the region that the psychological moment was lost in the few days after Parliament took Britain out of the picture on 29 August. The head of steam that seemed to herald an imminent attack has dissipated, and it is hard to imagine it being recreated. "If they had hit then, when the moment was hot, they might have got away with it in terms of repercussions," said one diplomat. "But to come back cold, weeks later, would be something else." Syrian rebels had been poised to exploit an American blow by trying to advance. Now they've suffered the double disappointment of seeing Mr Obama mired in domestic woes and then seizing the lifeline thrown by the Russian initiative, dismissed by the opposition coalition as a trick to win time. Mr Obama has also made it clear throughout that they were not pushing for regime change, more cold water for rebel hopes. The chemical weapons crisis has not stopped the conflict grinding on in almost all parts of the country, with about 100 people killed daily and no end in sight.
In other developments:
On the ground, the Syrian army is trying to retake the Christian town of Maaloula. The BBC's Jeremy Bowen, who has been at the scene, says heavy fighting continued throughout the day. Maaloula was overrun by rebel forces, including members of the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, at the weekend
The latest report by UN rights experts, released on Wednesday, says torture and rape are widespread and war crimes are being committed by both sides
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the UN and its members must share a "heavy burden" for their "collective failure to prevent atrocity crimes in Syria"
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said Syria had to be stripped of its chemical weapons and that those who had used them must "pay a price"
The UK-based pro-opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said an air strike on a field hospital in Aleppo province had killed at least 11 people
'Bilateral'
Russian news agencies quoted one Russian source as saying: "We handed over to the Americans a plan to place chemical weapons in Syria under international control. We expect to discuss it in Geneva."
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and US Secretary of State John Kerry are scheduled to meet in the Swiss city on Thursday to discuss the proposal. They spoke by telephone on Wednesday.
One Russian source told the Itar-Tass news agency the meeting would be bilateral and not involve the UN.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US President Barack Obama: "I have a deeply held preference for peaceful solutions"
The source added: "It appears that the meeting should start on Thursday and end on Friday, although it is not ruled out that it may last until Saturday."
No further details of the proposal have been made public.
However, US state department spokesperson Jen Psaki said that Moscow had so far "put forward ideas" rather than a "lengthy package".
They also confirmed that Mr Kerry would meet UN-Arab League special envoy on Syria Lakhdar Brahimi in Geneva.
The BBC's Daniel Sandford in Moscow says there appears to be disagreement between the Russians and the Syrians over whether the weapons should be destroyed.
They say the Syrians are eventually likely to concede the point and allow the arsenal to be dismantled because the Russians will argue that is the only way to gain broader acceptance of the plan.

Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem on Tuesday made the fullest public admission so far that Syria owned a chemical weapons stockpile and gave a clear commitment to the Russian plan.
"We are ready to inform about the location of chemical weapons, halt the production of chemical weapons, and show these objects to representatives of Russia, other states and the United Nations," they said.
"Our adherence to the Russian initiative has a goal of halting the possession of all chemical weapons."
The US holds the Syrian government responsible for a chemical weapons attack in Damascus on 21 August, saying it killed 1,429 people. The Syrian government blames the attack on rebels.
Until Tuesday morning, Mr Obama's government had been lobbying hard for support in Congress for military strikes.
But surveys of politicians had shown they were unlikely to win the planned vote.
In a televised speech from the White House, President Obama said the Russian plan and the regime's admission that it held chemical weapons were "encouraging signs".
"It's too early to tell whether [the Russian plan] will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments," they said.
Speaking at the Pentagon on Wednesday amid ceremonies to mark the anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks, Mr Obama said: "Let us have the wisdom to know that while force is at times necessary, force alone cannot build the world we seek."
There have already been heated debates at the UN over a possible Security Council resolution on Syria.
The French put forward a draft resolution that would be enforced by Chapter VII of the UN charter, which would in effect sanction the use of force if Syria failed in its obligations.
The draft resolution, obtained by Reuters, sets a 15-day deadline for Syria to provide a full account of the types and location of its chemical weapons.
Correspondents say Moscow opposes any resolution that would be authorised under Chapter VII.
Russia has also said any draft resolution putting the blame on the Syrian government would be unacceptable, and urged a non-binding declaration backing its initiative.
France insists military action remains an option.
President Francois Hollande said on Wednesday: "France will remain in permanent contact with its partners, mobilised to punish the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime and to deter them from using them again."

From 1960 to the late 1980s, there was one man documenting the experience of black life in the Twin Cities of Minnesota. Charles Chamblis was to the Twin Cities — in particular North Minneapolis — what Jamel Shabazz was to Brooklyn in the 1980s, or what Addison Scurlock was to Washington, D.C, for more than five decades: friendly, never without their camera and fluid enough to mix with any social setting, whether it was photographing a family barbeque along Lake Calhoun or the burgeoning music scene taking over the local nightclubs. Chamblis was affectionately known throughout the community as “the Pictureman,” and was never without their camera. Their record of black culture and black life is a veritable who's who of major music stars who, at the time, were up-and-coming stars of the funk and soul music movement.
Chamblis was born in Pittsburgh in 1927 and was honorably discharged from the Marines after having served in World War II. They decided to settle in Minneapolis and worked as a freelance photographer for the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder for several years. They died of a rare blood disorder in 1991. Their photos, now part of the Minneapolis Historical Society, always managed to show the upside of life: the candor of people on the backs of bikes, playing cards around the table in the front yard or dancing along Lake Calhoun.
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, blacks made up nearly 16 percent of North Minneapolis' population, and its music scene was never more vibrant. Funk music had exploded onto the scene, and with it a shockwave of flamboyant outfits and new artists being a revolutionary sound. The history of the Twin Cities' contribution to black music is embedded in each of Chamblis's photographs. They documented nearly every seminal artist who originated in Minnesota who helped birth funk music before they became major talents around the world: Prince, Jellybean, Morris Day (who played in a band with Prince during high school), Pierre Lewis of the Commodores, Terry Lewis and Cynthia Johnson. The latter, two started in the band Flyte Tyme, and Terry Lewis would go on to super stardom as one-half of the Grammy-winning production team that helped launch the career of Janet Jackson. Cynthia Johnson, who was crowned Miss Black Minnesota 1976, would go on to become an award-winning vocalist and was known for their 1980 smash hit “Funkytown.”
Similarly, Chamblis captured a moment in time for the music venues in Minneapolis that operated as the hub of the black music scene before some of their doors shuttered in the early 1990s. Places with sultry, enticing names like Taste Show Lounge, Lux Lounge, The Flame, The Jet-Away and P.J. Clarke's all acted as “the spot” for communing on weekends for all-night dance parties.
A retrospective of Chamblis's work, taken primarily between the 1960s and 1980s, was recently displayed at the Minnesota History Center exhibit: “Sights, Sounds and Soul: Twin Cities Through the Lens of Charles Chamblis,” and can still be viewed online.

Two years ago, researchers from Deft University of Technology in the Netherlands came up with a design for a windwheel that could generate electricity without any moving parts, imagining that it could offer a safer and quieter alternative to wind turbines.
Now Dutch architects have taken their idea and run with it, designing a giant version of the windwheel that would not only generate enough electricity to power 1,000 homes, but would soak up solar energy, collect and recycle water, and also serve as a tourist attraction, a hotel, and a home packed with 72 apartments.
As you can see, that all looks pretty damn impressive. People in the Netherlands have famously been using wind energy for centuries with their windmills, which convert the kinetic energy of wind into mechanical energy through the spinning blade, but this new set-up uses something called electrostatic wind-energy conversion, which involves wind pushing charged particles against the force of an electric field.
The only problem is that so far no one has actually demonstrated that the technology works on such a large scale - the current prototype tabletop-sized. Still, according to the Dutch Windwheel company and the Deft University researchers who came up with the idea, the technology should theoretically be easily scalable, and can be used anywhere there's wind. You can see how it works in this video from 2013:
The new windwheel design is slightly more ambitious, at 173-metres (570-feet) tall, and is made up of two parts: an outer wheel, which would act as a London Eye-esque Ferris wheel that shows off the skyline of the Dutch city of Rotterdam, as well as a view below its canal, with 40 rotating, glass cabins; and an inner wheel that would offer some sleek office space, a seven-storey hotel, 72 apartments, and a restaurant with sweeping views of the city.
“We wanted a 100-percent-sustainable building that serves as a platform for all kinds of innovations,” developer Lennart Graaff from the company behind the new design, Dutch Windwheel, told Mary Beth Griggs over at Popular Science.
Dutch Windwheel
This all sounds (and looks) like something out of science fiction, but the physics behind the design is solid. The proposed structure would be built right on top of a water source, such as a canal, and will use that water to spray positively charged water molecules across the hollow centre of the windwheel. When the wind pushes these charged droplets away from the wheel's high-voltage electric field, it will create a negative charge.
This charge will form a current as the electricity discharges. "Much like when the negative charge that builds up in thunderclouds discharges to the ground via lightning strike," Griggs writes for Popular Science. The electricity will then be converted into AC and used to power the windwheel, or stored in an industrial battery, and according to Graaf, will be capable of generating 1 MW of electricity, which is enough to power roughly 1,000 average US homes.
Dutch Windwheel
But so far the miniature prototype windwheel produces just 12.5 milliwatts, which isn't enough to power a lightbulb, and has only reached 3 precent efficiency. With traditional wind turbines currently at around 45 percent efficiency, the windwheel clearly has a long way to go before it becomes an affordable option. But with additional investment and research, Graaf believes the giant design could be up and running in Rotterdam by 2025.
The wheel also has proposed systems in place to generate additional energy from solar panels, and also collect and recycle tap water, as you can see in the sketches below:
Dutch Windwheel
We obviously need to see a larger working windwheel prototype - as well as the efficiency of the design go way up - before we get too excited. But an energy-harvesting structure that can house people and add something unique to a city skyline? That's pretty special.

The Ukrainian army says it has seized a key town near the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, as fighting rages in the east.
Pro-Russia separatists were driven out of Avdiivka on Wednesday, the army said. The strategic town is near the airport and train station in Donetsk.
Heavy fighting around Donetsk has again prevented international experts from reaching the crash site of flight MH17.
Meanwhile, Russia said new sanctions were "destructive and short-sighted" and would lead to higher energy prices.
Almost two weeks after the Malaysia Airlines jet came down, international monitors were turned back to the city of Donetsk by separatist amid clashes in the area.
Some critics say it is not in the interest of the Ukrainian army for observers to get to the site as it would restrict their offensive, says the BBC's Tom Burridge in Kharkiv.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Russia's economy is suffering as sanctions take effect and borrowers are facing rising interest rates
Regional officials in Donetsk said on Wednesday that 19 people had been killed in fighting in the past 24 hours.
Ukraine says its troops have also entered the towns of Shakhtarsk and Torez in Donetsk region, and Lutuhyne in Luhansk region.
On Tuesday, the US announced new economic sanctions against Russia, widening their scope to include three key sectors of the economy - energy, arms and finance.
US nationals and people living in America will no longer be able to bank with three Russian banks - the VTB, the Bank of Moscow and the Russian Agriculture Bank (Rosselkhozbank).
Peace 'more important'
The EU is also expanding its sanctions, targeting the oil sector, defence equipment and sensitive technologies.
Details of new EU sanctions are now due to be revealed on Thursday, a day later than expected.
Sanctions are starting to bite in Russia, with the rouble down and borrowers squeezed by rising interest rates, says the BBC's Daniel Sandford in Moscow.
Image copyright AP Image caption Stocks at Russia's second largest bank, VTB, tumbled after the new sanctions were announced
A senior US state department official told the BBC that Russia's central bank had been forced to spend tens of billions of dollars in order to defend the rouble.
"If Russia continues on this current path, the costs on Russia will continue to grow," US President Barack Obama said on Tuesday.
Russia's foreign ministry said the new US sanctions were "destructive and short-sighted" and would aggravate relations between the two countries.
It also attacked fresh EU sanctions as "thoughtless and irresponsible" and said they would "inevitably" lead to higher energy prices in Europe.
Russia retaliates
The first sign of retaliation came after Russia announced a ban on most fruit and vegetable imports from Poland.
Russia buys more than 2bn euros (£1.6bn; $2.7bn) worth of EU fruit and vegetables a year, making it by far the biggest export market for the products.
Polish fruit growers said the ban was political but Russia said the move was for sanitary reasons.
Meanwhile, Germany's Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said the sanctions could hurt the German economy, which has strong trade links with Russia.
"Nonetheless at a time of war and peace, economic policy is not the main consideration," they told journalists.

The list of 87 targets of EU sanctions now includes the heads of Russia's intelligence agencies, the president of Chechnya, and two Crimean energy firms.
However, UK company BP, which owns nearly 20% of Russian state oil giant Rosneft, said further sanctions could "adversely impact" its performance.
Russia has come under increased pressure to end its support for the rebels, who Western governments believe were behind the downing of MH17, killing 298 people.
Moscow has also been accused by the US and EU of supplying heavy weapons to the rebels - a charge it denies.

Since the dawn of time, humanity has been a slave to its own animalistic behavior. Anger, greed, lust, these simple instincts have led to countless tragedies, as we were blinded by them, and could only see the short term rewards. Even after atomic fire rained from the sky, giving humanity a chance to start anew, we still resorted to becoming animals.
Nearly 190 years after the nuclear fallout, a small band of travelers came together and formed a trading caravan, marching across the wastes in search of fame and fortune. However, the trials were harsh, and do to constant runs ins with raiders, mutants, and savages, the caravan had barely any supplies to sustain themselves, let alone money. They went on with high hopes, yet they remained unknown by the rest of the world.
One day, the caravan came across the ruins of a village, built out of the remnants of a pre war suburb. All that remained of this village were ashes, corpses, and a small child. The caravan, either out of sympathy or pridefulness, decided to take this child and raise it as their own. The boy called themselves Kennedy, and freely went with the group. The boy didn't seem to know what happened to the village, as if they had not paid attention to the slaughtering of their own people. Even when under the care of the caravan, they grew close to none of the travelers, talking to them as if they were acquaintances. The caravan soon grew to dislike Kennedy, but continued to travel with him, as they felt responsible for their safety.
Many years passed, and Kennedy soon grew into a teenager. Sadly, the process had not been kind on him. They had short, scraggly, greasy brown locks, and unkempt facial hair that came out of of their face like patches. Their body odor was also unpleasant, and the lack of proper hygiene didn't help. The travelers were growing older as well, and soon they would need to come to terms with the limitations of their own aging bodies. However, one of the travelers, who referred to themselves as Rice, was not yet ready to give up their dreams of fame and fortune, and decided that it was time to take a different approach. On their travels, the group found a collection of tents, filled with uniformed men serving something known as the New California Republic.
While the travelers tried to barter off what little they had, and Kennedy ate away at some spare food, Rice began to talk with the camp's sergeant, and the two struck a deal. The NCR would consistently pay the caravan if they delivered rations and supplies from one area to the next, and only traded with settlements which were a part of or allied with the NCR.
When Rice told the others of the offer, the travelers immediately stopped trading with the camp, and packed their supplies to leave. The group did not see eye to eye with Rice, as they wished to gain fortune independently, and not be tied down to any one group. They marked Rice as a traitor to their dream caravan, and demanded that they leave.
"Fine!" yelled Rice, "I don't need any of you, or this stupid caravan! I'll make it big all on my own. Next time you'll see me, I'll be surrounded by caps, booze, and women!"
Kennedy immediately stopped what they were doing and ran over to Rice.
"Did you just say women?" asked Kennedy, looking up at the "traitor."
"Hell yeah, kid! I'll be covered in them!"
"I want to go with you, please."
Like most young men their age, Kennedy had become very interested in the opposite sex, yet life with the caravan denied them the chance of meeting many women who weren't trying to kill them for supplies. Rice was amused by Kennedy's almost pathetic plea, and decided to travel with them as a companion.
And just like that, Kennedy and Rice had left the others. And for the next few years, things seemed to work out for the two. They went from town to town, performing odd jobs to raise enough caps to eat. When they had saved up enough money, they would prepare to move on to the next town. It wasn't an easy life, but it was one that the two were proud of. But one day, while Rice was out hunting radroaches to take care of a settlement's infestation problem, Kennedy tried to get a prostitute to sleep with him. The prostitute took the caps and ran off. When Rice confronted Kennedy, they acted as if none of what had happened was their fault, and refused to apologize for loosing all of their money. This caused a bitterness to grow between the two, and they soon mutually despised each other.
Eventually, Rice decided to leave Kennedy in the middle of the night. When the young man woke up, all that remained was a note, and a strange device.
"Sorry kid, I can't have you tagging along anymore. If we ever meet again, I'll be living it up in one of those summer homes on the beach. I left behind a little something for you to remember me by. I found it in a trash can."
Kennedy picked up the device, and flipped the small switch on it. A digital map popped up, with the words "unofficial Vault Tec vault finder" appearing above it. The map showed Kennedy's current location, and a list of nearby vaults, the underground fallout shelters that humanity took shelter in. One particular vault caught Kennedy's eye.
Vault 69.
Image caption UCU says that while students are paying more for courses, they have less choice
There has been a 27% drop in the number of full-time undergraduate degree courses offered at UK universities over the past six years, data shows.
Research by the University and Colleges Union shows the number of undergraduate courses available has decreased from 70,052 in 2006 to 51,116 in 2012.
UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said there was "less choice" for students.
Dale Bassett, research director of think-tank Reform, said the figures were "misleading".
UCU's analysis of data from the admissions service, Ucas, found course reduction was worst in England, at 31%.
In Scotland, where local students do not pay fees, the reduction was 3%.
Undergraduate courses available in Northern Ireland were down by 24% between 2006 and 2012, and in Wales they were down by 11%.
Although students in England are expected to pay up to £9,000 a year to study, there is much less choice for them Sally Hunt, University and Colleges Union
In England, where tuition fees will rise to a maximum of £9,000 per year from this autumn, the rate of course cutting is varied among the regions, with six of the nine regions experiencing a cut of 25% or more.
The South-West is down down by nearly half (47%), the West Midlands and London both down by a third (33%), but in the East Midlands, courses were axed by just 1.4%.
The report also found that among the single subject courses examined in the UK, science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) has seen a fall of 14.6%, while social science courses had dropped by 12.8%, and arts and humanities were down by 14%.
'Much less choice'
Ms Hunt said: "Although students in England are expected to pay up to £9,000 a year to study, there is much less choice for them.
"We fear that shifting the burden of funding from the state to the student means nervous universities will look to axe even more courses that they worry won't make a profit."
But Mr Bassett told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "There are far more people going to university than ever before. There are 100,000 more places every year."
They said: "What we are seeing is choice in action. There are more joint honours degrees, which is what employers want, and more part-time provision."
Ms Hunt disagreed: "There are more students but a reduction in choice. If you are saying that rather than doing a degree in maths or engineering or chemistry you have to do it together than that's a very poor argument."
Commenting on the research, Professor James Ladyman, professor of philosophy at the University of Bristol, said: "I am really concerned that under the new funding environment, universities will look at concentrating their resources on courses which they believe will deliver the highest financial return.
"Provision shouldn't be decided on the basis of short­‐term popularity contests, but when you introduce a market that is what happens."
A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: "Our reforms are freeing up places at the institutions where students wish to study and bringing higher education into more local communities.
"Student choice is becoming more meaningful and no one should be put off as a result financial concerns."
Official figures from Ucas show the numbers of people applying to university in the UK had been rising - up until this year.
As of January this year, 462,507 UK students had applied for courses beginning this autumn, compared with 506,388 at this point last year, a drop of 8.7%.

Things are not looking good for Ol' Web-Head in Marc Webb's upcoming superhero sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man 2. We already know that Spidey (Andrew Garfield) will be surrounded by villains, Jamie Foxx's Max Dillon/Electro likely chief among them. Just when it seemed as if our web-crawling hero already had their hands full, another villain has been revealed. We'll keep the potential spoiler until after the jump.
The film also stars Emma Stone, Dane DeHaan, Paul Giamatti, Felicity Jones, Chris Cooper, and Sally Field. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 opens in 2D, 3D, and IMAX 3D on May 2nd. Hit the jump for more.
News of a newly revealed villain comes courtesy of the director himself, so you can clearly cross this one off the rumor list. Here's a look at Webb's Tweet from earlier today:
Marc Webb ‏@MarcW Almost shot ASM2 in B+W til @bjnovak‘s (A. Smythe) promo for their excellent book ONE MORE THING beat me to it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FxhTn9cEhI …
For the more casual Spider-Man fans, this “A. Smythe” moniker probably requires a little explanation. It's not much of a stretch to presume that Novak's character is one Alistair Smythe, a once-wheelchair-bound scientist who developed (or technically, inherited) a series of robotic Spider-Slayers. This confirms what we've suspected about Novak's character ever since they briefly commented on their role a couple of months ago:
I'm in a couple of scenes. Yeah, I was never told whether or not I could say. I can say that I work at Oscorp. And I am someone from the comic books, someone from the original. So, yeah, I'm somebody. I wouldn't say I'm pivotal, but I'm not an extra, either.
Now, in the comics Smythe eventually suits up themselves and becomes the Ultimate Spider-Slayer. I doubt we'll see Novak do much more than tinker around with the killer bots, at least for this movie. Giving Spidey plenty of mindless drones to bash certainly does allow for an uptick in the destruction, but at this point, what they really needs is another helping hand.
Lux Research Unveils RISK Platform to Analyze Growing Resource Risks
The Resource Intelligence for System Knowledge (RISK) platform provides companies with a powerful tool
to understand and manage their dependence on critical natural resources
BOSTON, MA – November 17, 2015 – Companies with complex supply chains can be exposed to unexpected risks – or miss valuable opportunities – that stem from their dependence on natural resources, from water to land to energy. Resource scarcity, price volatility, and increased social and environmental pressure all threaten supply disruption and unplanned price spikes – but for most companies, the impact of resource dependence remains hard to evaluate.
Lux Research's Resource Intelligence for System Knowledge (RISK) platform is designed to help navigate this treacherous landscape. RISK integrates more than 200 data sources on subjects like land use, water needs, and energy into a decision-support system to visualize value chains with geospatially accurate data.
"Natural resource dependence is becoming one of the biggest risks that a company faces, so companies are now looking to optimize their resource efficiency across their value chains," said Ory Zik, VP of Analytics at Lux Research.
"The RISK platform can help companies benchmark their global operations from the perspectives of profitability, resilience, and sustainability, determine where substitution strategies can be deployed, and foresee where breakthrough innovation can have the most impact," they added.
Lux Research's RISK platform allows companies to:
The crowd at West Belfast Talks Back, part of Féile An Phobail. Picture by Declan Roughan
BORDER controls are likely to be introduced post-Brexit, a former Irish ambassador to Canada said last night.
Speaking at the West Belfast Talks Back event as part of Féile an Phobail, Ray Bassett told a packed crowd at St Louise's College that there is "absolutely no realistic proposal at the moment which would avoid a border" after the UK leaves the European Union.
Mr Bassett was joined by panellists including Sinn Féin's northern leader Michelle O'Neill, Irish News columnist Alex Kane and former Victims' Commissioner Patricia McBride.
During a wide-ranging discussion, Ms O'Neill described Brexit as a disaster.
They questioned how people of different backgrounds could shape a new future in Ireland post-Brexit and suggested that the Irish constitution could be amended to recognise British identity.
The Mid-Ulster MLA said they were keen to see a united Ireland which also respected people's sense of Britishness.
During a discussion on how to address the past, panellists agreed that British soldiers involved in Troubles-era crimes should not be immune from prosecution.
Ms McBride said amnesties could not be given to certain groups.
"We're not a post-conflict society, we're a society transitioning out of conflict," they said.
The education secretary was drowned out by jeers upon taking the podium at the historically black Bethune-Cookman University and cut their address short
Betsy DeVos was met with boos while addressing graduates of Bethune-Cookman University in Florida on Wednesday, as some students turned their backs in protest against Donald Trump's education secretary.
DeVos, whose selection as the commencement speaker was opposed by many students and faculty at the historically black university, was drowned out by jeers upon taking the podium and at numerous points throughout their speech.
“While we will undoubtedly disagree at times, I hope we can do so respectfully,” they remarked.
“Let's choose to hear one another out. I want to reaffirm this administration's commitment to and support for [historically black colleges and universities] and the students they serve.”
DeVos strained to overcome the hecklers, often raising their voice. The crowd had erupted in boos at the very mention of their name by Edison Jackson, the university's president, who presented DeVos with an honorary doctorate.
DeVos finished their remarks in 20 minutes, as opposed to the one hour of allotted time. Photos and video of the event showed roughly half of the 380 graduates turning their backs on the education secretary, who was confirmed by the US Senate in February only by a historic tie-breaking vote cast by the vice-president, Mike Pence.
DeVos sought to underscore the Trump administration's commitment to historically black colleges and universities, known as HBCUs, telling them audience: “I am at the table fighting on your behalf.”
In late February, Trump held a meeting at the White House with representatives of 64 of the country's 100 HBCUs. But advocates have been skeptical of the new administration, which has often projected a dismissive attitude toward civil rights.
DeVos came under fire themselves in February for framing HBCUs as “real pioneers when it comes to school choice”, a reference to their desire to move toward a more privatized education system in the US.

Them comments were roundly condemned for ignoring the history of HBCUs, which were founded during the era of racial segregation. Laws at the time barred African Americans from attending schools, thus leaving them with no choice but to create their own.
Jackson defended the university's decision to host DeVos in a statement, saying: “If our students are robbed of the opportunity to experience and interact with views that may be different from their own, then they will be tremendously less equipped for the demands of democratic citizenship.”
Things aren't going so well for Uber these days. California wants the company to stop testing its self-driving vehicles without the state's permission, and on Monday Bloomberg reported that the company lost $800 million in Q3 2016 on revenues of $1.7 billion. To make things worse, that number doesn't include anything the company lost in China, a market in which Uber has been spending heavily of late. All told, the poster child for "disruption" looks set to lose more than $3 billion this year.
We imagine this news will engender much Schadenfreude. Just this year the company settled a lawsuit with drivers from Massachusetts and California, settled a second lawsuit from customers alleging sexual assault by their drivers, settled a third lawsuit over misleading claims about background checks for drivers, lost a legal battle in the UK to prevent its drivers from being classified as employees, got fined by the French courts for operating an illegal taxi service, and told California where it could stick its self-driving permits. It even hired people to pretend to be journalists to aid another lawsuit.
But if regulations and laws are there for the company to ignore, so too it seems are basic economic principles like "turning a profit." Despite plenty of criticism that it pays drivers too little, it also evidently isn't charging its customers enough. 2016's losses may well wipe out almost all of the gigantic cash injection Uber received from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund back in June.
Meanwhile, Uber faces ever more competition, not only from Lyft but also GM's Maven. The ride-sharing space is only getting more crowded as car manufacturers fall over each other to grab a slice of the "mobility" market.
Filmmakers behind Channel 4 show What Happens in Kavos have been made to stop filming after production notes were found that ask staff to film vulnerable and drunk British holidaymakers.
The documentary's film crew were told to focus on stories of unprotected sex and infidelity, with staff offered incentives to find young women who use the morning after pill.
What Happens in Kavos, which is filmed at the Corfu resort, was shooting its second series. The Channel 4 website claims the show reveals a "startling view of Kavos through the eyes of the young Brits who go there to work and play". The three-part documentary was a success for Channel 4 with the 16-34 audience earlier this year and was the most tweeted about show on the day it aired in January.
Series two promises viewers "material peppered with intimate and revelatory interviews with the holidaymakers, young workers and the locals".
However, these production notes suggest that this material is gained with intention to shock. Crews are asked to find "groups who are successful with pulling and who have sex" and encouraged to continue filming at the end of the night in amourous holidaymakers' apartments. If staff found women using the morning after pill, they would get "a special prize for this story".
Workers in Kavos told The Sun that the crews "are hated on the island". It is the staff's responsibility to make sure people who are filmed sign a form declaring they are "informed and sober", but an unnamed holiday rep said "it never happens. I have seen them push pens into people's hands who are literally being sick through drink."
Dragonfly Film and Television Productions have been commissioned by Channel 4 to make What Happens in Kavos. The London company confirm that the documents do exist, and are bringing the crew back from Kavos to reassess the situation.
Simon Dickson, Dragonfly's managing director, said: "The language and implications in the memo were completely unacceptable. We have apologised to Channel 4 and halted production so we can regroup the team in London, investigate and fully understand how this happened."
A Channel 4 spokesperson said: "Channel 4 does not condone the deeply inappropriate references to casting in the What Happens in Kavos production notes. We've recalled the team to remind them of the standards of behaviour we expect from suppliers to Channel 4."

Mohammad Hammad, the San Francisco State University General Union of Palestinian Students president who has expressed their wish to kill IDF soldiers and longs for the destruction of Israel, has reacted to the exposure and unwanted publicity these posts have brought him.
Needless to say, he's unrepentant.
Personal Statement of Mohammad Hammad Concerning Recent Events* December 15, 2013 I want to thank everyone who has supported me over the past couple weeks as I have faced these attacks in the media. Everyone who knows me knows that these attacks are inaccurate, dishonest, and not at all reflective of my character or beliefs. An organization with a track record for hyperbole and misrepresentation has taken some of my old personal blog posts out of context. The style of my posts has ranged from sarcastic, sardonic dark humor, to passionate and indignant reactions to current events. Sometimes they were immature, or driven by pure emotional reactions to the terrible injustices committed on behalf of Israel against my fellow people. Although this does not negate the fact that the posts were immature, the way they have been portrayed, through selective quotations and other misrepresentation, is so over-the-top, irresponsible, and disingenuous, that I have received numerous death threats as a result. It should be noted: all my blog postings were and always have been mine and mine alone, and not related to other students or GUPS in any way. These attacks are meant to suggest that I have a propensity towards violent actions, and that I harbor hatred towards the Jewish people. Let me be clear: I do not now, nor have I ever, had any intention of committing violence against anybody. School should be a safe place for everyone to learn and, most of all, express constitutionally-protected views without fear of punishment or smear campaigns. Furthermore, I stand firmly against racism, regardless who the target is. My views about Israel and its military are based on the government's history, policies,practices, and personal experience gained from living in Palestine, not on any perceived affiliation with Judaism or Jewish people. It is deeply offensive to suggest, as my attackers have, that a reaction to the Israeli military's actions is somehow directed at all Jewish people, as if all Jewish people identify with and condone the state of Israel and everything it does. I cannot help but note that the group attacking me for expressing my outrage at human rights violations by the Israeli military has nothing to say about the actual violence committed by Israeli troops against Palestinians on a daily basis. That should go to show what this is really about: the crime of being Palestinian and the crime of refusing to accept the way Israel treats the Palestinians. The best way for me and others to overcome this ordeal is to keep speaking truth to power and not to let them silence us. I am very grateful for the continued support of fellow students and allies both on campus and across the globe. – Mohammad Hammad * This is my personal statement only, and does not represent the General Union of Palestine Students, which will release a separate organizational statement.
So Hammad's argument is basically the posts were old, personal and taken out of context, since their style was either sarcastic, sardonic dark humor, or passionate and indignant reactions to current events. They have no intention of committing violence against anybody, and does not hate Jews.
Now let's revisit the offending posts in light of this letter.
Are they “personal”? Well, yes, in the sense that they are representing himself. But they are clearly meant for the consumption of others, not like a personal diary that only the author themselves would read. In fact, their Tumblr and FB page (notice their user name is Dr Sexy) reveal someone who seems to be very extroverted and loving the outside attention.
Are the posts “old”? One is from August, and the other from late October. So while technically they are “old” in the sense they are not from this month, they are very recent.
As for claiming they are “sarcastic, sardonic dark humor, to passionate and indignant reactions to current events”, let's examine the first post.
“I seriously can not get over how much I love this blade. It is the sharpest thing I own and cuts through everything like butter and just holding it makes me want to stab an Israeli soldier….”
I don't sense any sarcasm nor humor in this post. They seem pretty serious about it. There's also no indication it is a reaction to a current event, not that this constitutes any excuse for such a threatening post.
Regarding the more recent post, again no hint of sarcasm nor humor.
Stories of children killed by IDF soldiers, as in there being an altercation and the soldier responds by firing on the kid and kill them They make me so, so, so incredibly angry Of course every death of a Palestinian at the hands of an Israeli piece of shit is going to make me angry, but these more personal stories [not that others are not personal, but you know what I mean] Like I'm sitting here looking through pictures of that fucking scum xxxxx xxxxx who murdered Mohammad Sulayma back in December of last year, and they were praised for it and faced no fucking repercussions and just Back when it happened, I sent them a very long winded, angry letter complete with pictures of the boy they killed: And how's they doing? Well, here's their fucking Facebook: — That cover photo that cover photo They murdered the boy on their 17th birthday as they were going out to get some cake. They were hard of hearing, and when asked to stop, became frightened and jumpy After an altercation [which the IDF posted an *edited* video of], Nofar opened fire on Mohammad and murdered them on the spot, and then refused to allow any Palestinians near the body to offer them any aid or assistance Yet they have the audacity to post a peace sign as their cover photo?! They ask why it is that we as Palestinians hate them so much They ask why it is that we are so “violent” They as why it is that we will always refuse peace with these fucking animals They act surprised when we fight back, when we lash out in frustration, anger, and despair and we're still seen as the animals WE'RE the “uncivilized” ones, WE'RE the ones who are making this all into a “problem” Anyone who thinks there can be peace with animals like this is absolutely delusional, and the only “peace” I'm interested in is the head of this fucking scum on a plate, as well as the heads of all others like her, and all others who support the IDF The Liberation of Palestine can only come through the destruction and decimation of this Israeli plague and it can't possibly come soon enough.
The post definitely falls under “indignant reaction, ” but what they are reacting to can hardly be termed a “current event”, since the killing of palestinian Mohammad Sulayma was in December of last year. They rather seem to be driven by sheer hatred.
I think a reasonable person could read the posts and doubt Hammad's claim they do “not now, nor ..ever, had any intention of committing violence against anybody”? Again..
I seriously can not get over how much I love this blade. It is the sharpest thing I own and cuts through everything like butter and just holding it makes me want to stab an Israeli soldier —- Anyone who thinks there can be peace with animals like this is absolutely delusional, and the only “peace” I'm interested in is the head of this fucking scum on a plate, as well as the heads of all others like her, and all others who support the IDF The Liberation of Palestine can only come through the destruction and decimation of this Israeli plague and it can't possibly come soon enough.
I certainly don't think it is worth the risk of finding out.
This article is about the insect. For other uses, see Silverfish (disambiguation)
A silverfish (Lepisma saccharina) is a small, wingless insect in the order Zygentoma (formerly Thysanura). Its common name derives from the animal's silvery light grey colour, combined with the fish-like appearance of its movements. However, the scientific name (L. saccharina), indicates the silverfish's diet consists of carbohydrates such as sugar or starches.
Description [ edit ]
Silverfish are nocturnal insects typically 13–25 mm (0.5–1.0 in) long.[2] Their abdomens taper at the end, giving them a fish-like appearance.[3] The newly hatched are whitish, but develop a greyish hue and metallic shine as they get older.[4] They have two long cercis and one terminal filament at the tips of their abdomens; the filament projects directly off of the end of their body, between the left and right cerci. They also have two small compound eyes, despite other members of Zygentoma being completely eyeless, such as the family Nicoletiidae.[3][5]
Like other species in Apterygota, silverfish are completely wingless.[3][6] They have long antennae, and move in a wiggling motion that resembles the movement of a fish.[7] This, coupled with their appearance and silvery scales, inspires their common name. Silverfish typically live for two to eight years.[4] Silverfish are agile runners and can outrun most of their predators (including wandering spiders and centipedes). However, such running is possible only on horizontal surfaces, as they lack any additional appendages, and therefore are not fast enough to climb walls at the same speed.[citation needed] They also avoid light.[8]
Distribution [ edit ]
Silverfish are a cosmopolitan species, found in Africa, the Americas, Australia, Eurasia, and other parts of the Pacific.[9] They inhabit moist areas, requiring a relative humidity between 75% and 95%.[10] In urban areas, they can be found in attics, basements, bathtubs, sinks, kitchens, old books, and showers.[4]
Reproduction and life cycle [ edit ]
A silverfish
Before silverfish reproduce, they carry out a ritual involving three phases, which may last over half an hour. In the first phase, the male and female stand face to face, their quivering antennae touching, then repeatedly back off and return to this position. In the second phase, the male runs away and the female chases him. In the third phase, the male and female stand side by side and head to tail, with the male vibrating their tail against the female.[11] Finally, the male lays a spermatophore, a sperm capsule covered in gossamer, which the female takes into their body via their ovipositor to fertilize their eggs. The female lays groups of fewer than 60 eggs at once, deposited in small crevices.[12] The eggs are oval-shaped, whitish, about 0.8 mm (0.031 in) long,[13] and take between two weeks and two months to hatch. A silverfish usually lays fewer than 100 eggs in their lifetime.[2]
When the nymphs hatch, they are whitish in colour, and look like smaller adults. As they moult, young silverfish develop a greyish appearance and a metallic shine, eventually becoming adults after three months to three years.[12] They may go through 17 to 66 moults in their lifetimes, sometimes 30 in a single year—many more than most insects. Silverfish are among the few types of insect that continue to moult after reaching adulthood.[14]
Ecology [ edit ]
Pages in a book damaged by silverfish that consumed portions of it.
Silverfish consume matter that contains polysaccharides, such as starches and dextrin in adhesives.[4] These include book bindings, carpet, clothing, coffee, dandruff, glue, hair, some paints, paper, photos, plaster, and sugar. They will damage wallpaper in order to consume the paste.[15] Silverfish can also cause damage to tapestries. Other substances they may eat include cotton, dead insects, linen, silk, or even their own exuvia (moulted exoskeleton). During famine, a silverfish may even attack leatherware and synthetic fabrics. Silverfish can live for a year or more without eating if water is available.[2][4][16]
Silverfish are considered household pests, due to their consumption and destruction of property.[2] However, although they are responsible for the contamination of food and other types of damage, they do not transmit disease.[4][17] Earwigs, house centipedes, and spiders are known to be predators of silverfish.[18][19]
Etymology [ edit ]
The scientific name for the species is Lepisma saccharina, due to its tendency to eat starchy foods high in carbohydrates and protein, such as dextrin.[4] However, the insect's more common name comes from its distinctive metallic appearance and fish-like shape.[20] While the scientific name can be traced back to 1758, the common name has been in use since at least 1855.[21][22]
Evolution [ edit ]
Together with jumping bristletails, the predecessors of silverfish are considered the earliest, most primitive insects. They evolved at the latest in mid-Devonian and possibly as early as late Silurian more than 400 million years ago.[1] Some fossilized arthropod trackways from the Paleozoic Era, known as Stiaria intermedia and often attributed to jumping bristletails, may have been produced by silverfish.[23]
Similar species [ edit ]
Other similar insect species are also known as silverfish. Two other silverfish are common in North America, Ctenolepisma longicaudata and Ctenolepisma quadriseriata.[12] Ctenolepisma urbana is known as the urban silverfish.[9] The Australian species most commonly referred to as silverfish is a different lepismatid, Acrotelsella devriesiana.[3] The firebrat (Thermobia domestica) is like a silverfish, but with mottled gray and brown bodies.[24]
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak discussed efforts to lift the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, at a meeting with their Palestinian counterpart Mahmoud Abbas.

Egypt reopened its border with the Gaza Strip following the deadly raid on a flotilla of Gaza-bound aid boats by Israeli forces in May.
Mubarak's government on Tuesday rejected an Israeli proposal that would leave Gaza entirely dependent on Egypt for goods and access.
The rejection came in response to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision on Sunday to let Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz to come up with a proposal for complete Israeli disengagement from the Gaza Strip.
"This kind of talk confirms what we have been saying for years, which is that there is official Israeli thought which aims to evade responsibility for the Gaza Strip and dump it on Egypt," a spokesperson for the foreign ministry in Cairo said.
Under the proposal, Israel would close all of its land crossings into Gaza, leaving the blockaded enclave completely dependent on Egypt for the movement of people and goods.
"Egypt confirms that Gaza is an integral part of the occupied Palestinian territories, and of the future Palestinian state. There is no room to talk or think of it as anything else," the spokesperson added.

However, Cairo had faced criticism prior to that for the secretive construction of a steel barrier underground beneath the border, aimed at curtailing smuggling tunnels.
Mubarak also discussed Abbas' recent tour that took them to Turkey, the United States, Spain and France.
Egyptian foreign minister Ahmed Abul-Gheit, Yasser Abd-Rabo, of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat also attended the meeting held in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.
Abbas met with Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa late on Monday, following Moussa's first visit to the Gaza Strip since they took the post, where they met with Hamas officials.
Moussa entered the enclave via the Rafah crossing point, which Egypt reopened on June 1, after Israel's seizure of the six-vessel aid flotilla.
Around 10,000 Palestinians have crossed the border and tons of medical and humanitarian aid have also been driven into the enclave.
Israel and Egypt have maintained a blockade on the Gaza Strip since Hamas took control of the area in 2007. Occasionally, Egypt has opened the Rafah border for three or four-day periods.
But this is the first time that the border has been opened for an indefinite period of time.

Recent news of the rapid advance of the Islamic Fundamentalist organization ISIS across a wide swath of Iraq may indeed have come as a shock to a large number of Americans. Indeed, to the general public who pay very little attention to the affairs of other countries or even their own, the fact that the ISIS now controls a large portion of Iraq as well as a portion of Syria not only conjures up images of American foreign policy failure but also of the possibility of re-invading Iraq in order to quell the fundamentalist forces.
The irony, of course, is that “al-Qaeda” and ISIS would never have been in Iraq to begin with had it not been for the United States nor would it have been in Syria if it were not for the fact that the United States, NATO, and the West in general organized, funded, trained, armed, and directed it.
Unfortunately, the Orwellian nature of the manner in which the “news” is presented to the American public almost absolves them of the blame for being utterly confused at the events transpiring overseas. From the constant fearmongering and propaganda after 9/11 over the dangers posed by Islamic terrorists to our “freedoms” to the subsequent open funding of al-Qaeda in other countries, the American people are constantly bounced back and forth between fear and support of the terrorist organization and networks now in control of such large portions of land in the Middle East.
Thirteen years after 9/11, extremists have gained more power in the region than they ever had before the “Global War On Terror” began. The only question is why they were allowed to seize so much territory, particularly inside a country that was seemingly so important to the United States.
Before going any further, it should be pointed out that any suggestion that the resurgence of ISIS and the march across Iraq caught the Western intelligence apparatus by surprise is entirely ludicrous. As Tony Cartalucci points out in their article, “NATO's Terror Hordes In Iraq A Pretext For Syria Invasion,”
All roads lead to Baghdad and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is following them all, north from Syria and Turkey to south. Reading Western headlines, two fact-deficient narratives have begun gaining traction. The first is that this constitutes a “failure” of US policy in the Middle East, an alibi as to how the US and its NATO partners should in no way be seen as complicit in the current coordinated, massive, immensely funded and heavily armed terror blitzkrieg toward Baghdad. The second is how ISIS appears to have “sprung” from the sand dunes and date trees as a nearly professional military traveling in convoys of matching Toyota trucks without explanation.
Of course, it is equally ludicrous to suggest that the only options available to the United States are reinvasion or allowing Iraq to fall to terrorist savages. There is indeed a third way out of the tragedy that has befallen the Iraqi people which lies within the very nature of ISIS. As Tony Cartalucci writes,
In actuality, ISIS is the product of a joint NATO-GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] conspiracy stretching back as far as 2007 where US-Saudi policymakers sought to ignite a region-wide sectarian war to purge the Middle East of Iran's arch of influence stretching from its borders, across Syria and Iraq, and as far west as Lebanon and the coast of the Mediterranean. ISIS has been harbored, trained, armed, and extensively funded by a coalition of NATO and Persian Gulf states within Turkey's (NATO territory) borders and has launched invasions into northern Syria with, at times, both Turkish artillery and air cover. The most recent example of this was the cross-border invasion by Al Qaeda into Kasab village, Latikia province in northwest Syria.
Thus, with ISIS being a creation of NATO and the GCC, the most realistic solution – if the United States was truly interested in stopping the progression of the terrorist organization and rolling back its recent gains – would be to stop funding and supporting it.
Indeed, it falls entirely on the shoulders of the United States that ISIS now controls the amount of territory that it does across Syria and Iraq not only because the American invasion caused Islamic fundamentalist fighters to enter the country as a result of a power vacuum but also because it was the American forces who funded and enabled the fighters to attack Sunni and Shia members of the Iraqi resistance for the purpose of breaking the resistance to the American occupation.
Even more important to recent events, however, is the fact that the United States continues to fund such fighters – ISIS specifically – on the Syrian front. The now famous report from Seymour Hersh entitled “The Redirection” eludes to as much when they wrote,
To undermine Iran, which is predominantly Shiite, the Bush Administration has decided, in effect, to reconfigure its priorities in the Middle East. In Lebanon, the Administration has coöperated with Saudi Arabia's government, which is Sunni, in clandestine operations that are intended to weaken Hezbollah, the Shiite organization that is backed by Iran. The U.S. has also taken part in clandestine operations aimed at Iran and its ally Syria. A by-product of these activities has been the bolstering of Sunni extremist groups that espouse a militant vision of Islam and are hostile to America and sympathetic to Al Qaeda.
While Hersh's report was written in 2007, knowledge of the plan to use death squads to target Middle Eastern countries, particularly Syria, had been reported on even as far back as 2005 by Michael Hirsh and John Barry for Newsweek in an article entitled “The Salvador Option.”

With millions of dollars having been openly funneled to Syrian “rebels” more aptly termed “death squads,” there is no debate that the United States, NATO, and its Gulf client states are funding ISIS and groups like it. As Tony Cartalucci points out,
Combined with reports from the US Army's West Point Countering Terrorism Center, “Bombers, Bank Accounts and Bleedout: al-Qa'ida's Road In and Out of Iraq,” and “Al-Qa'ida's Foreign Fighters in Iraq,” it is clear that Iraq's Al Qaeda/ISIS legions were created, funded, and armed by Persian Gulf states and are augmented with foreign fighters drawn from Libya's terror epicenter of Benghazi, and Saudi Arabia in particular. These legions have been in operation in one form or another since they were first created by the US CIA, Saudi Arabia and Pakistani intelligence during the 1980s to combat Soviet forces in Afghanistan.
Still, Cartalucci correctly notes that the Western media would have its audiences believe that the emergence of al-Qaeda and ISIS in Iraq simply went unnoticed until the organization had conquered vast areas of Iraqi territory. Cartalucci writes,
The Western media and the governments providing them their talking points now expect the general public to believe that somehow “Twitter donations” and “bank robberies” have managed to outpace this unprecedented multinational logistical feat and give Al Qaeda the edge over the West's nonexistent “moderate” forces in Syria and give rise to phantom terrorist legions capable of seizing entire provinces across multiple national borders. The evidence simply doesn't add up.
For these reasons, informed observers must come to the conclusion that the United States, NATO, and the GCC are entirely in control of the situation on the ground in Iraq. Again, however, the question is “why?” There exists two further possibilities as to what purpose allowing or directing the movement of ISIS in this manner serves.
First, ISIS' assault has not only allowed for the conquering of territory that will undoubtedly be used as a staging ground for further assaults against Syria by the terrorist organization but it also allows cover for ISIS to be armed with heavy military equipment such as tanks, Humvees, and possibly even helicopters as well as small arms and ammunition with which to harden its assault against the Assad government. Essentially, the recent forward march by ISIS allows NATO to arm the terrorist organization with such powerful military equipment without doing so openly in the eyes of the general public and the rest of the world.
Second, and most likely, is the possibility that the United States has allowed ISIS to conquer Iraqi territory so as to justify the eventual invasion of Syria in addition to the reinvasion of Iraq. Indeed, any deployment of American troops, airstrikes, or any other type of US military force, will necessitate a battle against ISIS inside Iraq as well as “cross-border” strikes against the organization in Syria. Such “cross-border” strikes would likely be met with apathetic support from the American people since any restraint regarding borders will be presented and then viewed as placing “handcuffs on the troops.”
Make no mistake, however, any military action taken across the border inside Syria will not be taken for the purposes of eliminating ISIS. The truth is that such military action will be nothing more than a backdoor attempt at establishing the “buffer zone” that NATO so ardently desired early on in the Syrian conflict. With the establishment of this “buffer zone,” a new staging ground will be opened that allows terrorists such as ISIS and others the ability to conduct attacks even deeper inside Syria.
In a truly interesting twist, the United States now claims to be considering an agreement between itself and Iran for the purposes of maintaining order in Iraq and the elimination of ISIS from its positions in the country. Iran, for its part, has already contributed a number of Quds forces to Iraq for purposes of maintaining security. Yet, despite the noble aims Iran may have in eliminating terrorism, Iranian leaders should remember that they too are on the Anglo-American target list. With this in mind, it would be wise to avoid spreading their own military too thin when the American war machine inevitably turns toward them.
A nurse in Utah and a couple in Texas stood up for their rights as guaranteed to them in the Bill of Rights. The Utah nurse hasn't filed suit, but the Texas couple did, and in both cases law-enforcement officials have been exposed and shamed for their illegal conduct. Both cases were aided with the help of videos taken of the incidents.
The first has caught national attention and has stirred national outrage. On July 26 Alex Wubbels was on duty as head nurse of the University of Utah Hospital's burn unit when a truck driver was wheeled in suffering from severe burns. They had been hit by a driver fleeing police and was comatose when they arrived in the ER.
Salt Lake City police detective Jeff Payne arrived at the hospital with instructions to obtain a blood sample from the comatose driver to test for elicit substances and ran into nurse Wubbels who knew the hospital's rules: There would be no blood drawn unless 1) Payne was there to place the driver under arrest; 2) they had a warrant to perform the procedure; or 3) they had obtained the driver's consent.
None of these applied. Nurse Wubbels checked with their supervisor who confirmed the hospital's rules: No blood would be drawn on the comatose driver by Payne.
Several videos of the incident are available at YouTube which, taken altogether, have been viewed more than a million times. At the 6:51 minute mark on the longest one, detective Payne loses their temper owing to frustration and arrests Wubbels. After nearly 20 minutes sitting in the back seat of Payne's cruiser, they are released. The days that followed were no doubt a blur for nurse Wubbel, what with media interviews, statements, and public appearances. They received a public apology from the city's mayor “on behalf of” the city's police department. They most notably did not receive an apology from detective Payne who has been “placed on paid administrative leave.”
Last Thursday nurse Wubbells was reliving the experience for NBC News. They told them, “At the very least there needs to be some significant discussion about what [the officer's] duties are to society. And I am still confused. I'm a health care worker. The only job I have is to keep my patients safe.” What happened that day “was not peaceful. This was not even civil.”
Nurse Wubbel got support from the nurses' union National Nurses United, which called the incident “outrageous,” with Jean Ross, the group's president, adding: “As the videos and news accounts make clear, there is no excuse for this assault, or their arrest, which sends a chilling message about the safety of nurses and the rights of patients.” (Emphasis added.)
The hospital policies reflect the on-the-ground implementation of the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which declares that “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and the persons or things to be seized.”
As noted by Amy Swearer, a visiting legal fellow of the Heritage Foundation, “It is a long-standing rule that drawing blood is a ‘search' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment because it is ‘an invasion of bodily integrity [which] implicates an individual's most personal and deep-rooted expectations of privacy.'”
Swearer also disposed of arguments by Payne that these were “exigent circumstances” that overrode the comatose driver's rights and the hospital's rules designed to protect them from such illegal searches. “Exigent circumstances,” they explained, only exist in the most pressing, most urgent, most immediate situation where a delay is likely to result in the destruction of crucial evidence of a crime.
In their response to Officer Payne's claim that Nurse Wubbel was interfering with a police investigation — a ruse too often used when others aren't available — Swearer pointed out that that only applies when certain actions “hinder, delay, or prevent the investigation,” which Nurse Wubbel wasn't doing. On the contrary, as the videos clearly show they were polite, courteous, and professional in explaining to the increasingly exasperated Payne the hospital's rules.
Nurse Alex Wubbels has not ruled out legal action.
That isn't the case with Huntly and Susan Dantzler who live in a rural area of Gillespie County, Texas. On May 3, 2015, they were awakened by two police officers pounding on their front door at 6:35 a.m. Police demanded to see their son, Huntly Dantzler, Jr., who, through an anonymous tip that later proved to be false, was thought to be harboring a woman whom they had drugged at a local bar earlier that night.
The Dantzlers knew their rights, and they claimed them. They informed the officers that Huntly, Jr. wasn't at home. The officers, after a 15-minute conversation that became louder over time, pulled Huntly from the front door, pushed them to the ground and handcuffed him. They then turned to their wife who, despite witnessing their husband being taken down, continued to protest that the officers wouldn't be allowed to search their house. Seeing their husband in great distress, they allowed one of the officers to enter the house on the condition that they check only Huntly, Jr.'s bedroom to confirm that they aren't there. The officer, taking advantage, searched the entire house and confirmed that what the couple had been claiming was accurate after all: Huntly, Jr. wasn't at home.
In December 2015, they filed suit against the officers who, according to the complaint, “engaged in an invasion and search of the Plaintiff's home without reasonable grounds and against the will and protestations of the Plaintiffs.” The complaint continued:
Additionally, the Defendants effected a seizure of one of the Plaintiffs [Huntly, Sr.] without sufficient cause and using unreasonable and excessive force, caused significant personal injury and damage to the Plaintiffs….
The Defendants, acting under a claim of right and without the voluntary consent of the Plaintiffs, conducted a search of the Plaintiff's resident without probable cause … thereby depriving the Plaintiffs of their rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
The Dantzler's complaint also charged the officers with false arrest under Texas law, and assault and battery. The complaint was explicit: “Defendant Westbrook [one of the officers] intentionally and with malice made harmful and offensive contact with the person of Plaintiff Dantzler and there committed assault and battery.”
The Dantzlers demanded a jury trial.
This was followed by much legal wrangling, including a motion by the Dantzlers for a summary judgment in their favor. This, of course, was opposed by the legal team representing the officers in February of this year.
More wrangling ensued until September 1 when the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas granted nearly all of what the Dantzlers sought. Under the law a summary judgment is granted when plaintiffs show “that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and [thus] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” The video and audio from the officers' dashcam, coupled with video taken by Susan Dantzler on their cellphone at the time, provided irrefutable evidence of the illegal search, false arrest, and assault and battery of their husband.
In celebrating that victory, John Whitehead, president of the Rutherford Institute which represented the Dantzlers, said:
What makes this case so striking is the contrast between American citizens who not only know their rights but are exercising them [compared to] government officials — in this case, the police — who are either completely ignorant of what the law requires (namely, a search warrant and probable cause) or who don't believe the laws of the land, namely the Fourth Amendment, apply to them.
The next move for the Dantzlers is likely to be a demand for monetary damages, while Nurse Wubbel appears to be weighing their options. What is crystal clear is that, in each incident, Americans knew their rights and stood up against officers who didn't, or who ignored them. There are at least three lessons to be learned in these incidents: Videotaping of the incidents provided irrefutable evidence of the transgressions that the officers could not rebut. These incidents likely provide incentive for other law-enforcement officials to step carefully in the future when tempted to violate Americans' precious rights. Finally, and perhaps most importantly for those involved in the freedom fight like members of The John Birch Society, is the comfort in knowing that, in these cases at least, the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States is still in force.

As many women can relate, being dumped is a horrible feeling filled with sorrow and pints of ice cream.
But in Samantha La Rocco's case, their pity party was brought to an abrupt halt Sunday when they received an uplifting message on their to-go container from Truly Vegan, a restaurant in Los Angeles.
"I had just been dumped and was in full-blown break up mode," La Rocco, 23, told GoodMorningAmerica.com. "I was ordering food in, and my hair was mess and I had my break up pants on."
In the midst of their sorrow, they decided to include a note in the special instructions section online while placing their order that read, "I've just been dumped. Please draw something inspiring on the container."
Not expecting the restaurant to even really read the note, let alone follow through, they were more than pleasantly surprised when they received their salad.
"It was the happiest salad I've ever had in my life," they said. "I kept the container. It's still in the refrigerator."
Included on the Styrofoam box was a stick figure holding a sign surrounded by hearts that said, "You're worth it," followed by "You don't need them to be happy," with a sunshine above it.
The message on the box was exactly what La Rocco needed to pick themselves up and dust themselves off.
"This is the best break up I've had," they said. "The food container thing has totally helped."
And as for the man who dumped them after a year and a half of dating, they say, "It was so dumb. He's a very young 25. Let's put it that way."
A Lincoln High history teacher and former president of the Portland teachers union has been removed from the classroom and put on leave after they used the N-word repeatedly during one class and pressed their body against a female student during another.
Jeff Miller, 55, a longtime union leader who has taught history for decades, primarily at Cleveland High but more recently at Wilson and Lincoln high schools, was put on a paid leave of absence, beginning Monday, after they used the N-word during a lesson on Southern race relations last week.
During another class, captured on video by a student, Miller spent more than 10 minutes directing students to body-surf and play air guitar and also wriggled their backside against that of a female student while imitating a rock guitarist.
Lincoln Principal Peyton Chapman confirmed that Miller is on leave but refused to say why. Miller's attorney, Patrick Bryant, also declined to reveal or discuss the allegations but said, "He is a well-liked teacher of nearly 30 years in the district, and we're hoping and anticipating that he'll return to the classroom . . . as quickly as possible."
In a letter to students and parents Wednesday, Chapman sought to reassure them that the school has secured an excellent long-term substitute to replace Miller while they are "temporarily" on leave.
"My administrative team and I will continue to monitor the classes closely to ... provide a rigorous, challenging and meaningful classroom experience that our students deserve," they wrote.
Miller's suspension comes at a time when Portland Public Schools is striving to root out poor classroom performance by getting teachers to improve or be fired. A record number of teachers had their contracts cut short this spring or agreed to resign after they were told their performance was unacceptable.
But Chapman said Lincoln's teaching standards have been high for a long time, not just this year. "Generally, what is my expectation for class time? I expect every minute of our scarce instructional time is used for instruction, and I expect excellent instruction in every class every day."
Miller served on the executive board of
for nine years before they were elected president. They presided from 2006 to 2008 and was known for their assertive representation of teacher rights.
Alex Burns-Miller, a student in Miller's junior U.S. history class where the N-word was spoken and the air guitar session held, said Miller is an outstanding teacher whose actions have been "blown out of proportion."
"He's inspiring, energetic. ...  They are a breath of fresh air for me personally," Burns-Miller said. "He is not boring like other teachers.  They are one of the best teachers I have ever had. We have learned so much."
The student with whom Miller pretended to play guitar sensed nothing inappropriate about their back-to-back contact with her, nor did their parents, their father said.
Burns-Miller said Miller used the N-word when they were impersonating a racist white Southerner to help students understand those times. The air guitar class was the last before winter break. "He likes to have fun with classes," Burns-Miller said. "Everybody was having a good time."
In the video, most students look stunned or uneasy, but others laugh, as Miller directs them to gather for "a rave," to lift a classmate over their heads and carry them to the neighboring classroom and to simulate playing guitar while Tom Petty music blares. They joke repeatedly about marijuana.
The video, which was posted publicly on YouTube, went viral among parents and teachers before it was reset for private viewing only.
When Miller used the racial slur, a student objected, Burns-Miller said. They said the teacher explained why they used it but did not repeat it. A second student gave the same account.

Chapman would not confirm that Miller used the term in class. Teachers they have observed, including English teachers discussing "Huckleberry Finn," choose to say "N-word" rather than the slur itself because it is so offensive. "Our general policy is that we don't use racially offensive terms at Lincoln."
Creating a racially sensitive climate is a top priority of Portland Public Schools, which have poured a lot of time and money into racial awareness training. Lincoln teachers have undergone monthly training in that vein this year, including having students of color and the school's minority support coordinator share their views during faculty meetings, Chapman said.
"We are concerned about the achievement gap at Lincoln and the research shows that the No. 1 impact on student achievement is the teacher in the classroom," they said.
Miller's attorney said Miller is cooperating with district officials investigating their conduct. "As of yet, nothing has been completed," Bryant said.
Lincoln teacher David Bailey was away at a journalism conference during the past week and has no knowledge of what took place in Miller's class. They also haven't watched the video.
But, as a teacher at Lincoln for decades, they said they think language that could be construed as offensive can be appropriately used in class, such as during a discussion of censorship or the power of language. Such lessons must be in context and handled with sensitivity, they said. On the flip side, they cautioned that even when students say they find teacher conduct acceptable or funny, it may not be.
"We are adults and dealing with adolescents whose emotions and sensibilities often ride the winds," Bailey said. They said they also are concerned about "students who may find such behavior inappropriate but (are) unwilling to step forward for fear of being marginalized."

Robin Williams' grieving daughter Zelda Williams has quit social media after internet trolls and insensitive posters added to them despair.
PHOTOS: Robin's most iconic movie roles
While countless fans took to the internet to express their love and respect for the late actor and comedian who was found dead in their Californian home on Monday, Aug. 11, some unpleasant online characters took the opportunity to post horrific comments and pictures on daughter Zelda's Twitter page.
Initially requesting their supporters to report the trolls, who posted what appeared to be photoshopped images of their dad onto their account, Zelda, 25, later removed their tweet and instead decided it was better for them to delete their social media accounts entirely.

"I'm sorry. I should've risen above," they posted on Twitter, referring to the messages that had upset them in the hours following the devastating news of their dad's death. "Deleting this from my devices for a good long time, maybe forever. Time will tell. Goodbye."

The mourning actor also took a step away from Instagram, begging social media users to be respectful of them and their family in this difficult time.
"I will be leaving this account for a bit while I heal and decide if I'll be deleting it or not," they wrote. "In this difficult time, please try to be respectful of the accounts of myself, my family and my friends. Mining our accounts for photos of dad, or judging me on the number of them is cruel and unnecessary. There are a couple throughout, but the real private moments I shared with them were precious, quiet, and believe it or not, not full of photos or 'selfies'. I shared them with a world where everyone was taking their photo with him, but I was lucky enough to spend time with them without cameras too. That was more than enough, and I'm grateful for what little time I had. My favorite photos of family are framed in my house, not posted on social media, and they 'll remain there. They would've wound up on the news or blogs then, and they certainly would now. That's not what I want for our memories together. Thank you for your respect and understanding in this difficult time. Goodbye. Xo."

Earlier on Tuesday, Aug. 12, Williams' children Zelda, Zak, 31, and Cody, 22, all paid tribute to their father they were devastated to have lost.
During their tribute to their father, Zelda referred to the hurtful messages with stereotypical Williams wit. "As for those who are sending negativity, know that some small, giggling part of them is sending a flock of pigeons to your house to poop on your car," they wrote. "Right after you've had it washed. After all, they loved to laugh too." Read Zelda's other statement here.

Thirteen students will see the inside of a prison more than a dozen times by the end of this semester, but they won't be serving sentences.
Members of Central Michigan University's chapter of the national Inside/Out program spend every Tuesday evening of the spring semester in the Central Michigan Correctional Facility in St. Louis. SOC 399: Social Issues Through the Prism of a Prison is taught by sociology faculty Justin Smith, who received the 2015 Provost's Award for Outstanding Research and Activity for their examination of the criminal justice system.
"It's (13) students from the inside and (13) students from the outside," Smith said. "Half the students are from CMU and half are incarcerated men serving time in St. Louis correctional facility. We meet once a week. We talk about issues such as the criminal justice system, but we also talk about gender, race and racism, class, social change and social movements and collective action."
Both sets of students apply for and undergo an interview process before being accepted into the program.
Inside students are comprised of 13 men serving sentences in the facility, and range in age from 20 to 65 years old.
"About half of the 13 inside students are late 20's-early 30's and the rest are 45-65," said Rochester Hills senior Samantha Christie. "A lot of them have been incarcerated for several years, but they're up to date on current events. There's been class periods when I've learned more about a current event from one of them. It's cool to know that they're so interested in following along. They're inmates, and there's a reason for that, but it's easy to look past that."
This is currently the only course available at CMU that holds class inside of a correctional facility.
"I went to the closing ceremony at the end of April last year and heard a lot of the student comments, and a lot of them said that this was their best experience of their college career, going to St. Louis Correctional Facility to class," said Katherine Rosier, Chair of the Departent of Sociology, Anthropology and Social Work.
"A lot of this is a reaction to making sure we're improving education in prisons, but also in higher education institutions, so it's a way to offer CMU students a very diverse setting to learn in," Smith said. "It's a way to learn from a variety of experiences, a variety of ages."
They and Bradshaw would like to see other departments offer the same experience for students in the future.
"Both the inside guys and outside students get a lot out of it," Smith said. "The inside guys are mostly older, and they've been through a different lifestyle than the students. The students have had a lot more access to education. We're able to have a lot of good discussions. It isn't a lecture, we sit in a circle and discuss."
Livonia senior Brynn Cavanaugh found that their inside classmates were surprisingly "well-spoken" and helped generate interesting discussion on social issue topics.
"Different perspectives bring out different opinions, but we actually have a lot in common," Cavanaugh said. "A lot of our discussions are very unifying, there isn't a lot of difference between us."
CMU students wear maroon shirts and jeans when in class behind bars, donning uniforms of their own to address their classmates as equals.
The Inside Out program began in 1997 at Philadelphia's Temple University, and has since become a staple of social and criminal justice education at over 100 universities, including University of Michigan Dearborn, Michigan State, Grand Valley, Northern Michigan and Eastern Michigan Universities.
This program was adapted into a special topics course by Smith and sociology faculty Liz Bradshaw last year.
"It was a phenomenal experience. It leaves students with a changed perspective on the social justice system," Bradshaw said.
Yesterday I had a talk with my father about happiness and life in overall, and that small pep talk inspired me to put together a list of tendencies that I have found in both the observation of myself and those around me. These tendencies, in my opinion, can make life a lot more complicated and difficult to go through than it needs to be. Read through the list, see how many apply to you and feel free to add any others that you may want to share through the comment section of the article.
In Order To Be Happier You Need To Stop…
Comparing Yourself To Others
Don't compare your progress in life with that of others. Whether it's an iconic figure or even a friend or co-worker many of us have a natural tendency to compare ourselves or our circumstance to that of another. Think of the billion times you have said, either vocally or under your breath, “must be nice” when looking at another person's life. You need to know that we all need our own time to travel our own distance. Prove yourself to yourself, not others. The only person you should try to be better than, is the person you were yesterday. The moment we stop comparing and instead focus on our own experience the more likely we are to both find peace in things being the way that they are and motivation to change them should we feel pulled to.
Running from your problems
If you have a problem, it's your job to deal with that problem, no one is going to do it for you. You can't run from your problems forever, and believe it or not the longer you run from them the more difficult it becomes to face these problems. Don't blame others and quit making excuses, no one cares about them! See Also (How To Transform Any Situation In Your Life)
Stop wasting time
Unlike other things in life – money, love, respect, friendship, good health, hope, opportunities, school and many more – time is the one thing you can absolutely never get back once it's gone. And this is a good reason why you should wake up each morning and mindfully consider and plan what and who will give your day to, because once the clock hits 00:00 that day is gone, so choose wisely. See Also (5 Different Breaks You Should Take Starting Today)
Stop trying to re-live your past
A quote I love states: “If you only live to regret your past, you will never live to love your future.” – Edward Grey. Rather than preoccupy yourself with a comparison to another point in time why not try giving all of your energy and attention to the one that is right in front of you. If you have problems with your past and don't know how to move on I suggest you to read: How To Move On.
Stop looking For Someone Perfect
Not only is our idea of perfect most likely heavily shaped by entertainment and popular media but it is also ever changing and therefore pretty well impossible to ever be met. Instead of focusing on searching someone perfect try focusing on finding the perfect match for you, the one who completes you; he/she doesn't need to be perfect. We are all capable of being and feeling complete love on our own, relationships are simply the extension of that love with another person. The shedding of the need for “perfection” will also make you a lot more open to connecting and sharing experiences with anyone that comes into your life, remembering that love can often be found in the oddest places.
Stop Trying to make everyone happy.
Sometimes we get so caught up in trying to make others happy that we forget about ourselves. If you try to make everybody around you happy, you will exhaust yourself, both from the inside and the outside. The person who comes first when it comes to happiness is yourself. See also (24 Thought Provoking Questions You Need To Answer For Yourself)
Trying to be someone who you are not.
Whether it's the impact of popular opinion once again or simply the preference of someone you are trying to impress, we are never doing ourselves a favor when we try to become someone else. Focusing on understanding and fully owning with comfort who you truly are will take you a lot further in life than anything artificially created.
Surrounding yourself with the “wrong” people.
If the people surrounding you are not uplifting you or bringing you joy or having a positive effect on your life, make sure to ask yourself this question – Why are you still around them? If you can't think of a good answer, then you should stop hanging out with those people. Life is short and spending it with the wrong people is wrong. Go out and find the “right” ones and your life will change!
Letting others talk you out of your dreams.
I've seen too many examples, and that's one of the reasons I started motivationgrid.com, because I was upset by that fact. Why would you let anyone talk you out of your dreams? Others might not understand what your dreams mean to you. And that's normal, it's your dream, not theirs in the first place. So you owe to yourself to stop living for other people and their opinions. Be true to YOU.
Not appreciating what you have when you have it.
We often forget that happiness doesn't come as a result of getting something we don't have, but of deeply appreciating what we do have. And often times we start appreciating things only when we lose them. You won't always get exactly what you want, but you should always appreciate what you have.
Seeking validations from others.
You are good, you are smart, you are fine and you are strong. You are already valuable, that's why you don't need other people to validate you. You are YOU and that's the beginning and the end – no apologies, no regrets.
Being afraid of making mistakes stop you from doing what you want.
There is no way you will never make mistakes in your life, but you shouldn't be afraid of making mistakes. Growing up in life involves a lot of mistakes and learning from them. Don't be afraid of doing something because you won't make it from the first try. Don't let the fear of failure stop you, instead let failures be your guidelines until you learn how to make what you want to make.
Stop being negative
Having a negative output on life will only bring negative results. Negativity leads to more negativity. Focus on being more positive, try to see the good even when confronting bad situations. Just remember that you can't live a positive life with a negative mind.
Stop worrying so much.
Worry will not strip tomorrow of its burdens, it will strip today of its joy. One way to check if something is worth mulling over is to ask yourself this question: “Will this matter in one year's time? Five years? Twenty years?” If the answer is not, then it's not worth worrying about.
Talking the talk, but never walking the walk.
When it's all said and done, be sure you haven't said more than you've done. Remember that, actions always speak louder than words. So work in silence, and let your success be your noise.
If you are struggling with any of these, do not worry, you are not alone. We are all trying to improve, fix our lives and enjoy them more. So lets turn things around now – What do you think we should start doing in order to improve our lives?

As you may have heard, Viacom and YouTube have been having a little tift lately, in the form of a major lawsuit by the former over copyrighted material posted on the video portal. It's a lawsuit that, according to YouTube, will cause such video sites to "cease to exist in the current form" -- but more importantly, it's a lawsuit that leads to some rather hilarious behind-the-scenes details. Here's a really juicy one that the official YT blog published today by Chief Counsel Zahavah Levine. Word has it that Viacom had hired over the years at least 18 different marketing firms to inconspicuously upload content. We can't really say it better than the posting:
"[Viacom] deliberately "roughed up" the videos to make them look stolen or leaked. It opened YouTube accounts using phony email addresses. It even sent employees to Kinko's to upload clips from computers that couldn't be traced to Viacom."
Wait, it gets better. According to Levine, Viacom's tactics were so good that the company itself didn't even know which videos it had uploaded, prompting multiple occasions where it would demand a clip removed, only to later ask for its reinstatement. "In fact," they claim, "some of the very clips that Viacom is suing us over were actually uploaded by Viacom itself." Hit up the source link for all the details. Honestly, we can't wait to see what else is dug up in these proceedings.Of course, that's not the whole story. Also revealed in court documents today was discussions by Viacom to -- get this -- purchase YouTube before News Corp.'s Rupert Murdoch got the chance to do it himself. Let's be thankful for that judge's decision to unseal all court documents, shall we?
Voyagers! is an American science fiction television series about time travel that aired on NBC during the 1982–1983 season. The series stars Jon-Erik Hexum and Meeno Peluce.
Opening narration [ edit ]
We travel through time to help history along...give it a push where it's needed. When the Omni's red, it means history's wrong. Our job is to get everything back on track. Green light, kid! We did it!
Plot [ edit ]
Phineas Bogg (Jon-Erik Hexum) was one of a society of time travelers called Voyagers who, with the help of a young boy named Jeffrey Jones (played by Meeno Peluce) from 1982, used a hand-held device called an Omni (which looked much like a large pocket watch) to travel in time and ensured that history unfolded as we know it.
Bogg and Jeffrey first met when Bogg's Omni malfunctioned and took them to 1982 (the device was not supposed to reach any later than 1970), landing them in the skyscraper apartment of Jeffrey's aunt and uncle, who were caring for them after their parents' deaths. Bogg's Guidebook, which contained a detailed description of how history was supposed to unfold, was grabbed by Jeffrey's dog Ralph, and in the struggle to retrieve it Jeffrey accidentally fell out their bedroom window and Bogg jumped out to rescue them by activating the Omni. With their Guidebook stuck in 1982, Bogg (who, being more interested in girls than in history, apparently never paid much attention in their Voyager training/history classes) had to rely on Jeffrey, whose father had been a history professor, to help him. Jeffrey's knowledge proved invaluable; for example, in the first episode Jeffrey ensured that baby Moses' basket traveled down the Nile where it was met by the Pharaoh's daughter.
Phineas was timeless in their machismo, and managed to fall for a beautiful woman in almost every episode. Whenever Jeffrey's wisdom was paired up against Bogg's stubbornness, Jeffrey usually won out, to which Bogg would always mutter, "Smart kids give me a pain!" However, they developed a strong relationship and became a formidable team. In the course of their adventures together, they sometimes encountered other Voyagers whose missions happened to overlap with theirs.
It was revealed later in the series that despite Jeffrey's age, and the accidental circumstances of their first encounter with Phineas, they were always destined to become a Voyager.
Over the closing credits of each episode, regular cast member Meeno Peluce said in voice over: "If you want to learn more about [historical element from the episode], take a voyage down to your public library. It's all in books!"

Reception [ edit ]
Voyagers ran for one season of 20 episodes, broadcast opposite the top-rated 60 Minutes. The series averaged a 17 share. Voyagers! seemed likely to be renewed for a second season, but controversies in 60 Minutes reporting led executives to believe that 60 Minutes might successfully be challenged by a competing news program instead.[1] NBC canceled Voyagers![2] and replaced it with the news magazine program Monitor, which averaged only a 7 share.[1]

VHS release [ edit ]
In 1982, MCA Home Video released Voyager from the Unknown,[4] which edited together two episodes ("Voyagers" [the pilot episode] and "Voyagers of the Titanic") into one feature-length film that also incorporated new video special effects, some voice-over dubbing for Hexum and Peluce's characters that changed and added dialogue and new footage to include a super-computer which directed Voyager missions.
The opening begins with a narration and painted illustrations of Bogg receiving their Guidebook on "Planet Voyager" by artist Jerry Gebr.
"Far out in the cosmos there exists a planet known as Voyager, where the mystery of travel into space and through time has been solved. It is inhabited by a race who call themselves Voyagers. Their purpose is to keep constant surveillance on history. These people have a time machine device, the Omni, which will take them into the past, present or future. As each Voyager graduates they are given an omni and a guidebook. One such graduate Phineas Bogg, who was assigned as a field worker to operate in certain time zones."
DVD release [ edit ]
On July 17, 2007, Universal Studios Home Entertainment released all 20 episodes of Voyagers! on DVD in Region 1.[5] It was released in Region 2 on October 29, 2007.[6]

All 20 episodes are also available in the United States by streaming through Amazon Video.[7]

Stabbing: Leonardo Henry, 25, broke into their ex-girlfriend's home and stabbed them repeatedly
An 11-year-old Oklahoma girl shot their mother's abusive ex-boyfriend after they broke into their home and began stabbing their mother Tuesday morning.
Eleven-year-old Jayda Milsap shot Leonardo Henry, 25, with a handgun twice after they broke into their Oklahoma City home and began stabbing their mother in the eye, neck and chest, KFOR reports.
Just a week before the incident, Milsap's mother, Brandy Moreno, filed a restraining order against Henry claiming they 'had been molesting (several kids) in the middle of the night for several years,' KFOR reports.
They later told authorities they were afraid that Henry would hurt them or the children because they reported them to the police.
The Oklahoman reports that a neighbor said Moreno taught Milsap how to use the handgun one week before the incident 'so they could protect herself.'
The lessons came in handy.
Henry broke through the back door of the home at 4am leaving a trail of broken glass. Moreno's two children and Henry's three children were in the home at the time of the attack, New York Daily News reports.
After being shot by Milsap, Henry reportedly fled and was found down the street from the home, authorities say. They were taken to the hospital but police say they will soon be booked at the Oklahoma City Jail.
The Oklahoman reports that both Moreno and Henry were taken to the University of Oklahoma Medical Center in serious condition.

Sister: Henry's sister Emma Spence said that, though they hate to admit it, Henry may be guilty of the alleged sexual abuse
Hospital officials reportedly refused to report on the current condition of the two but KFOR reports that both the victim and Henry are expected to survive their injuries.
Milsap's neighbors hail them as a hero, according to KFOR. Even Henry's sister Emma Spence said that they salute the 11-year-old and that their brother may be guilty of the sexual abuse, though they hate to admit it.
'I salute her,' Spence told KFOR. 'It was awesome that they did that for their mom...I'm 21 and I don't even know how to use a gun.'
Milsap's neighbor, Carolyn Marsee said, in a KFOR interview, that they hope a judge puts Henry away for a long time.
'I could care less if they die, because what they did was very wrong,' Marsee said.
Authorities say that, as of now, the shooting appears to have been justified and the children have been taken into protective custody with the state Department of Human Services.
HBO is turning to the playwright of the Tony-nominated Broadway production of Hand to God for its next comedy.
The premium cable network is developing half-hour comedy Brotherhood from playwright Robert Askins, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.
The comedy takes place at the largest Baptist university in the world where a young man joins a secret organization that has two goals: party harder than anyone else and write the funniest, most incisive campus humor magazine in history.
Askins will pen the script and executive produce the comedy for HBO alongside Jon Krisel (Man Seeking Woman), Danica Radovanov (Portlandia), Good Universe's Joe Drake, Nathan Kahane and Spencer Wong (This Is the End, Neighbors). Krisel is attached to direct should the comedy script move to pilot.
The project, which landed at HBO in a competitive situation with four other networks bidding, stems from Askins' experience in a rebel secret society at Baylor University. Brotherhood was pitched as Animal House set at a conservative college and told from the perspective of the administration and the secret society.
Brotherhood caps a strong 2015 for Askins, who was nominated for a Tony for their play Hand to God on Broadway. Their other play, Permission, premiered at the Lortel Theatre. He's also sold a pitch through Chernin that's being developed through Discretionary and penned New Regency and Plan B's Black Hole for David Fincher.
Askins is repped by WME, Grandview and Shreck Law.
For HBO, Brotherhood comes after the cabler recently reversed course on a second season of political satire The Brink.
HANOI, Vietnam—Vietnam once again asserts that it has sufficient legal grounds and historical evidence affirming its sovereignty over Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelagoes, foreign ministry spokesperson Le Hai Binh said Thursday.
They made the statement during a regular press conference in reply to reporters' queries about Vietnam's stance on China's announcement on Monday that it had successfully landed military aircraft on airports in Vanh Khan (Mischief) and Xubi (Subi) reefs in Vietnam's Truong Sa islands.

Also on Monday, the Chinese Transport Ministry declared that it finished the construction of four lighthouses and began building the fifth on features in Truong Sa.
Regardless of Vietnam's protest and the international community's concern, those actions seriously violated Vietnam's sovereignty, Binh said.
“They are illegal and cannot change the truth about Vietnam's sovereignty over Truong Sa and Hoang Sa.”
READ: Vietnam faces dilemma after stunning setback for China
Vietnam requests China to immediately end violations of Vietnam's sovereignty, seriously abide by international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) and the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties (DOC) in the East Sea (South China Sea), as well as refrain from actions that complicate the East Sea issue, they stated.
Regarding whether Asean will issue a joint statement in response to the Arbitral Tribunal's award, Binh stressed that maintaining peace, stability, navigation and overflight security and safety in the East Sea is the common interest and responsibility of all countries within and outside of the region.
“Asean's consistent viewpoint is resolving disputes through peaceful measures, including diplomatic and legal processes, on the basis of respecting the UN Charter and international laws, including the 1982 Unclos,” the spokesperson said, adding that the grouping also underlines the role of its unity and centrality in ensuring peace and stability and promoting cooperation with partners.
They emphasised Vietnam's call on relevant parties to exercise self-restraint and respect international laws and the DOC, while not taking actions that complicate the situation so as to help maintain peace, stability and security in the East Sea.
The Hague Arbitral Tribunal on Tuesday rendered the ruling on the case brought by the Philippines against China's claims in the South China Sea.

It said China has caused permanent and irreparable harm to the coral reef ecosystem at the Spratly islands, and that it also has no historic title overwaters of the South China Sea.
Amnesty International VN's report ‘untrue'
The information mentioned in Amnesty International's recent report on the situation at detention camps in Vietnam was untrue, stated spokesperson Le Hai Binh.
Vietnam's consistent policy is to ensure and promote human rights in conformity with the country's Constitution and international standards, they said.
“As a member of seven United Nations conventions on human rights, including the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Vietnam always follows the member state's commitments and obligations strictly and fully,” Binh said.
The country's efforts and achievements in ensuring and promoting human rights have received acknowledgement from the international community, they added.

CNN panel discusses Trump campaign staff 'shake-up' (screen grab)
Trump campaign spokesperson Katrina Pierson left a CNN panel speechless on Wednesday after they denied that the campaign had undergone a “shake-up” after media reported a major shifting of roles at the highest levels of the organization.
According to reports on Wednesday, Trump hired Breitbart News Chairman Stephen Bannon as the campaign CEO and promoted Kellyanne Conway to the role of campaign manager. The move was seen as a demotion for embattled campaign chairperson Paul Manafort.
CNN's Carol Costello hosted a panel of guests on Wednesday to discuss the changes, which was derailed when Pierson lashed out at the media for calling the move a “shake-up.”
“The media and many on the right who have always been vocal against Mr. Trump have been writing this campaign's obituary for over 400 days and it hasn't worked yet,” Pierson told the group. “The thing is, when we are talking about campaign additions — and I know CNN is focusing on [Breitbart's] Bannon for whatever reason. He's not in charge of communications, he's just the CEO.”
“But they have a prominent role in the Trump campaign,” Costello pointed out.
“But that brings me to my next point, Carol,” Pierson continued. “We have not spent nearly as much time talking about Hillary Clinton's campaign infrastructure, particularly Huma Abedin and their dual role at the State Department and the Clinton Foundation.”
“I know you want to deflect,” Costello acknowledged. “And I appreciate that because that's your job.”
But Pierson missed the CNN host's remark because they were ranting about “direct ties to the Russian government” within the Clinton campaign.
Costello and the two other panelists were speechless.
“Let's talk about John Podesta, let's talk about their brother Tony, let's talk about the banks they're involved with, let's talk about the boards that they sit on,” Pierson droned. “We're not talking about that here on CNN.”
“That's because Donald Trump just shook up their campaign for the second time in a two month period!” Costello exclaimed.
“No, they didn't,” Pierson shouted back. “He added. Donald Trump adds people to their campaign. No one is out. When you shake up your campaign that usually means someone is out.”
“CNN is probably the only one reporting that some shake-up is happening,” the Trump spokesperson insisted.
“I dare to suggest this,” Costello said. “That no one was ousted simply because Mr. Trump didn't want this to appear to be a shake-up.”
“This is not something that people are being replaced,” Pierson declared. “This is an expansion of the team.”
“Even Fox News is calling this a shake-up,” Costello stated, shaking their head.
“But that's what I'm saying,” Pierson shot back. “It's not a shake-up!”

EgyptAir Cockpit Voice Recorder Has Been Recovered, Egyptian Officials Say
A ship in the Mediterranean has recovered the cockpit voice recorder from EgyptAir Flight 804 and taken images of "several main locations" of the plane's wreckage, Egypt's Civil Aviation Authority says.
The recorder was damaged, the agency said Wednesday, but the search team was able to recover the device's memory unit.
The recorder and the images were obtained by the ship John Lethbridge, the Civil Aviation Authority says.
The Associated Press reports that the vessel is operated by the U.S. company Deep Ocean Search and arrived at the search area on Sunday. The ship is equipped with underwater detection equipment, such as sonar, that can explore up to 6,000 feet below the sea's surface.
Flight 804 crashed into the Mediterranean Sea nearly a month ago, killing all 66 people aboard.
What caused the Airbus A320 to crash is still unknown. Investigators are hoping the voice recorder will shed light on what, exactly, happened. The plane's flight-data recorder has not yet been found.
Some small pieces of debris from the plane had previously been discovered by search crews, but the search continued for the bulk of the wreckage.
The Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority says search teams are now working on mapping the main wreckage locations and discussing how to "best handle the wreckage."
In 2016, after receiving feedback from about 150 free software community members, the High Priority Projects committee recommended extensive updates to the FSF High Priority Projects list.
The High Priority Projects initiative, first launched in 2005, draws attention to a relatively small number of projects of great strategic importance to the goal of freedom for all computer users. The list serves to foster work on projects that are important for increasing the adoption and use of free software applications and free software operating systems. The list helps guide volunteers, supporters, and companies to projects where their skills and resources can be utilized, whether they be in coding, graphic design, writing, financial contributions, or activism. We hope that you can find a project here where your skill, energy, money, and time can be put to good use.
The FSF does not ask to run or control these projects; some of them are GNU projects (and all are welcome to apply), but we are happy to encourage them whether they are done under our auspices or not.
In March 2016, the committee identified criteria that qualify a project for inclusion on the list. The list focuses on broad areas of need, highlighting projects within each area of need that are particularly promising. The committee also publicly discussed the update to the list at LibrePlanet 2016.
A separate changelog for the list is available, starting in 2017.
The FSF is committed to ongoing evaluation of and updates to the High Priority Projects list. Please email any suggestions you have about the list to hpp-feedback@gnu.org so that they can be incorporated by the review committee in the future.
High Priority Free Software areas:
Smart phones are the most widely used form of personal computer today. Thus, the need for a fully free phone operating system is crucial to the proliferation of software freedom. Read more...
This large and fragmented space deals with increased centralization of Web activities, and user reliance on servers they don't control (Service as a Software Substitute (SaaSS)). The free software community provided extensive feedback regarding many projects that fall under this initiative. Read more...
Drivers, firmware, and hardware are integral parts of the computers we use and the devices that interact with them -- and when these things are proprietary, they are incompatible with free software. Therefore, drivers, firmware, and hardware that can be fully used with free software are crucial to the operation of free systems. Read more...
Many widely used voice-over-IP programs, like Skype and FaceTime, use proprietary protocols and nonfree implementations. These programs seduce free software users into using proprietary software, often two users at a time. Using proprietary voice and video chat software means that we can't be sure who is listening in, because we can't see the code. Unfortunately, Google Hangouts is also not a solution here, because it still requires users to run proprietary software. Read more...
Free software relies on contributions from community members. But systemic barriers often prevent interested individuals from becoming contributors, especially when those individuals are from groups that have been historically marginalized. Read more...
Accessibility is the inclusive practice of removing barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to software programs by people with disabilities or impairments, or those using assistive, adaptive, or rehabilitative technologies. This includes adding features and building tools, including screen readers, keyboard shortcuts, and more, to increase access to software programs. Read more...
Internationalization is the process of designing software so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. Internationalization is a feature ethically tied to the values of free software, and is often a strength of free software. But we can do better: Free software can accept translation contributions from anyone who submits them, whereas proprietary software companies historically only bother with languages it serves their profit and other interests to include. When we internationalize free software, we make it easier for others to adapt and spread it in other languages and regions. Read more...
Security is a concern for all computing and all computer users. Although users cannot ever be truly certain of their security when using proprietary software, that does not mean free software is automatically secure. Free software developers and users must take steps to improve the security of free software projects. Read more...
Apple's Siri, Google Now, Cortana, Amazon Echo's Alexa, and other intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) are becoming more pervasive. Whatever convenience they provide comes with unacceptable tradeoffs: The breadth of access to users' data they take in order to operate is enormous, and both the client and server accessing such data are not distributed, posing Service as a Software Substitute issues. Read more...
Projects like those on the FSF Licensing and Compliance Lab's list of free distros are dedicated to distributing a complete GNU/Linux operating system that contains only free software. They are high-quality distributions that create a complete free operating system without any binary-only blobs or package trees that contain proprietary software. Read more...
Government adoption of free software has the potential for a huge effect on the proliferation of free software, given that government employs many people, funds millions in software contracts each year, and most people interact with their government in various ways. We must demand that government not be held hostage to proprietary software. Read more...
When doing business in East Asia, it's typically understood there are business-specific formalities one must execute to show respect and get respect.
Diplomacy follows the same principle. Going out of your way to extend courtesy opens the dialogue to commerce.
President Donald Trump may have had the best intentions in trying to level the playing field with Japanese automakers—where the trade gap is wide—but publicly stating it, in the host's country in front of a large contingent of traveling American press, is not seen as appropriate. Trump veering off script is no doubt considered rude in buttoned up cultures.
Trump's worn it all on their sleeve, so to speak, letting slip those adlibbed quips that gain so much attention. Like this one, on Monday, while fielding questions during a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Trump mentioned—unprompted—his disappointment that Japan didn't shoot down North Korean test missiles recently fired over the island nation.
Next time, Trump hinted, you wait and see.
“He will shoot them out of the sky when they complete the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,” Trump told journalists on Monday, standing alongside Abe at the Akasaka Palace in Tokyo, news media reported. “The prime minister of Japan is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as they should.”
Trump's message is mafioso in nature: pay us for “safety.”
And, they added, “It's a lot of jobs for us and a lot of safety for Japan.”
That's debatable, according to William Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank that works toward addressing the most urgent threats to the planet, like war, corruption, inequality and climate change.
The Japanese already have a contract for the F-35 Stealth Fighter, made by Lockheed Martin, a program fostered under the Obama administration. But the Japanese later re-worked the deal to have a factory in Japan itself, rather than in the States.
“Trump's big pitch was, ‘Buy our missile defense systems and we'll protect you,'” Hartung told the Observer, referencing the president's approach. “But they probably won't.”
Hartung, an East Asia analyst, said the likelihood of the Koreas going to war are low, experts have cautioned. And in South Korea, much of the population favors engagement and diplomacy, rather than war chants. Abe and Moon were trying to show level-headed appeasement of Trump's pushy showmanship
By Tuesday, Trump was enjoying themselves in South Korea, implying the Korean leader had promised to buy “billions” in American-made armament.
Moon was surprised, as are a nation of South Koreans who worry Trump's firebrand political rhetoric is antagonistic.
The trip includes stops timed with regional partnership meetings, where Trump got to flex their ability to issue off-the-cuff remarks in their usual assertive style, like they were at home. The problem, though, is that they aren't home. He's the guest of others.
The thousands of American businessmen and women routinely working with their East Asian-vendor partners are girding themselves in case of blowback.
But Trump's angle on everything is coded for North Korea's Kim Jong-un, who is likely unfazed and watching international broadcasters as they filmed Trump speaking live within missile range.
Surely that fact wasn't lost on Trump and their security detail.
It was precisely during that press event that Trump invited Kim to the negotiating table, something Moon has been trying to do, in an attempt to get the North Korean leader to give up their nuclear program in favor of other incentives that could greatly benefit their country and people.
But Kim is a bit like Trump—bombastic with action and unlikely to back down publicly, not wanting to lose face. That brinksmanship of avoiding embarrassment and remaining staunchly oppositional to a narcissistic fault is why Trump's unscripted diplomacy is so dangerous.
They gave a carrot, but they did it in a backhanded way, saying in part that Pyongyang should “come to the table and make a deal,” but added a caveat by saying, “We have many things happening that we hope—in fact, I'll go a step further—we hope to God we never have to use.”
Trump was referencing the three aircraft carriers and nuclear submarine posted in the Pacific as a deterrent to Kim's ambitions.
The mixed messages don't exactly foster trust from suspicions North Koreans who have their agenda of a nuclear-capable state.
Maybe Trump should leave the diplomacy to the ones they campaigned against—his well-qualified staff of career diplomats at the State Department.

A deteriorating political culture in Cambodia finds fuel in narcissism and social media, writes Mish Khan.
There is no stage quite like Cambodia, where political elites double as divas and where the culture of political dialogue is reminiscent of a schoolchild spat.
Cambodia's theatrical culture of antagonistic politics has been described as a “shame to the world” that has eroded any glimmer of healthy political dialogue between the two major parties, Prime Minister Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian's People Party (CPP) and Sam Rainsy's opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP).
The face of Cambodian politics has grown rife with ugly hostility and public disputes over the past several years, arousing headlines such as “PM Hun Sen expresses remorse about taking a selfie with opposition leader Sam Rainsy”, jabs from the CPP that “no one cares about the CNRP”, the CPP publicy ridiculing Rainsy for failing to measure up to Myanmar peace figure Aung San Suu Kyi, and Hun Sen re-sharing a Thai fortune teller's status to their Facebook page, predicting the downfall of the “dishonest” CNRP. This incited the comical, official response from CNRP, “The fortune teller has a personal view that has no impact on the Cambodia National Rescue Party.”
Currently, Sam Rainsy is in self-exile after being stripped of parliamentary immunity and charged with defamation for comments stating the CPP Deputy Prime Minister, Nor Namhong, helped run a prison for the Khmer Rouge. Acting CNRP opposition leader, Kem Sokha, has been hiding in Pnom Penh CNRP headquarters for months after failing to appear in court over allegations of an affair with a 25-year-old hairdresser. The basis for these accusations stem from audio clips leaked online under a questionable Facebook account. The CNRP denies their authenticity and many remain suspicious that the days-old account was created as a political tactic to smother the opposition.
The ferocity of Cambodia's politics has only grown worse with the proliferation of social media, as both parties battle to win over the 4.1 million Cambodians who have an online presence, amounting to roughly 25 per cent of the population. For perspective, there were just 6,000 Internet users in Cambodia 10 years ago. While much of the increase can be credited to the penetration of new technologies, it's also important to note that the tragedy of the Khmer Rouge genocide means that 68 per cent of Cambodia's population is under 30. Twenty-six per cent of Cambodians are between 14 and 30, an age perfectly ripe for political influence. A lack of well-established alternative media in Cambodia means Facebook provides the largest secondary platform for political influence.
This is something Hun Sen has perfected, a lesson learned after performing poorly in the 2013 elections where young, savvy opposition CNRP supporters rallied support online. Hun Sen's public Facebook page boasts 5.6 million likes, and is flooded with constant photos and regular live-streams of themselves interacting with the public.
In February, they made headlines for surpassing Sam Rainsy in Facebook popularity and even launched the Samdec Hun Sen phone app, which “offers news, photos and videos” featuring the Prime Minister and provides links to their Facebook page. Yet beyond the fun and festivities of their common-man approach to social media lie a sinister undertone. Late last year, Hun Sen announced that Cambodian Facebook users who criticise them or sensitive government issues will be traced, warning, “If I want to get you, I need less than seven hours.”
Interestingly, there is strong evidence that Hun Sen's page has purchased likes, with a large proportion of accounts stemming from India and the Philippines. Hun Sen has denied this, instead stating they are flattered to have won over the Indian people.
This is not the first example in Cambodian history of spotlights for the elite leaving leadership blind to serious national issues. King Norodom Sihanouk, the extravagant monarch who reigned after independence in 1953, was famous for their obsession with producing films in which they often played the leading role. As the Vietnam War began to spill over to Cambodia's borders, many Cambodians “saw Sihanouk's preoccupation with films as an important symbol of their failure to address more serious issues,” a factor in seeing their overthrow and the Khmer Rouge gaining power in 1975.
Today, the average Cambodian suffers at the vanity of the elite. In a country plagued by corruption, poverty, political violence and the shadows of genocide, a political crisis fuelled by personality politics and repressing political competition has left the nation in deadlock.
This show cannot go on.

- Tenho a segurança de afirmar que pouca gente admirou mais o futebol do Paulo do que eu. Ele sabe do meu apreço por ele e seu futebol, mas ao mesmo tempo tenho que ter discernimento, lucidez para perceber que existem momentos na vida que um ciclo se encerra e novas perspectivas surgem, o crescimento que somos obrigados a admitir, desde que tenha essa representatividade para ele. Ele me disse que gostaria de ir para a equipe que o está desejando, para estar num núcleo de futebol qualificado, que é o espanhol. É uma circunstância que não gostaria de vivenciar, mas que provavelmente vou ter que admitir porque faz parte da vida. É assim mesmo - garantiu o presidente, sem revelar detalhes da transferência do atleta.
No São Paulo desde 2012, Ganso marcou 24 gols em 221 jogos. Para Leco, apesar de não ter conseguido conquistar um título pelo clube, o jogador deixa um legado.
- É jogador extraordinariamente qualificado, com uma qualidade técnica invejável. Sempre se comportou muito bem e contribuiu muito para o São Paulo com o futebol maravilhoso que ele sempre nos apresentou - disse o mandatário, reforçando o clima de despedida.
Após a chegada do treinador argentino Jorge Sampaoli ao Sevilla, a diretoria do clube espanhol passou a buscar a contratação de Paulo Henrique Ganso. Em nota publicada nesta terça-feira no site oficial do clube, o diretor-geral do Sevilla, Ramón Rodríguez Verdejo, disse estar otimista com a possibilidade de contar com o jogador para a temporada 2016/17.

Machucado, Paulo Henrique Ganso não participou da partida de ida diante do Atlético Nacional, em que o São Paulo foi derrotado por 2 a 0 no Morumbi, na última quarta-feira. Para o confronto de volta, na Colômbia, o meia não viajou com a delegação, pois estava sem condições de jogo. Caso o Tricolor passe pelo Atlético Nacional, nesta quarta-feira, e chegue à final, o jogador pode atuar na grande decisão.

Frederick William II (German: Friedrich Wilhelm II.; 25 September 1744 – 16 November 1797) was King of Prussia from 1786 until their death. They were in personal union the Prince-elector of Brandenburg and (via the Orange-Nassau inheritance of their grandfather) sovereign prince of the Canton of Neuchâtel. Pleasure-loving and indolent, they are seen as the antithesis to their predecessor, Frederick II. Under their reign, Prussia was weakened internally and externally, and they failed to deal adequately with the challenges to the existing order posed by the French Revolution. Their religious policies were directed against the Enlightenment and aimed at restoring a traditional Protestantism. However, they were a patron of the arts and responsible for the construction of some notable buildings, among them the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.
Early life [ edit ]
Frederick William was born in Berlin, the son of Prince Augustus William of Prussia (the second son of King Frederick William I of Prussia) and Duchess Luise of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Their mother's elder sister, Elisabeth, was the wife of Augustus William's brother King Frederick II ("Frederick the Great"). Frederick William became heir-presumptive to the throne of Prussia on their father's death in 1758, since Frederick II had no children. The boy was of an easy-going and pleasure-loving disposition, averse to sustained effort of any kind, and sensual by nature.
Their marriage with Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, Crown Princess of Prussia, daughter of Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, contracted 14 July 1765 in Charlottenburg, was dissolved in 1769. They then married Frederica Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt, daughter of Ludwig IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt on 14 July 1769 also in Charlottenburg. Although they had seven children by their second wife, they had an ongoing relationship with their mistress, Wilhelmine Enke (created Countess Wilhelmine von Lichtenau in 1796), a woman of strong intellect and much ambition, and had five children by her—the first when they were still in their teens.
Wilhelmine von Lichtenau
Frederick William, before the corpulence of their middle age, was a man of singularly handsome presence, not without mental qualities of a high order; they were devoted to the arts — Beethoven and Mozart enjoyed their patronage, and their private orchestra had a Europe-wide reputation. They also are a talented cellist.[1] But an artistic temperament was hardly what was required of a king of Prussia on the eve of the French Revolution, and Frederick the Great, who had employed them in various services (notably in an abortive confidential mission to the court of Russia in 1780), openly expressed their misgivings as to the character of the prince and their surroundings. For their part, Frederick William, who had never been properly introduced to diplomacy and the business of rulership, resented their uncle for not taking them seriously.[1]
Reign [ edit ]
The misgivings of Frederick II appear justified in retrospect. Frederick William′s accession to the throne (17 August 1786) was, indeed, followed by a series of measures for lightening the burdens of the people, reforming the oppressive French system of tax-collecting introduced by Frederick, and encouraging trade by the diminution of customs dues and the making of roads and canals. This gave the new king much popularity with the masses; the educated classes were pleased by their removal of Frederick's ban on the German language, with the admission of German writers to the Prussian Academy, and by the active encouragement given to schools and universities. Frederick William also terminated their predecessor's state monopolies for coffee and tobacco[2] and the sugar monopoly.[3] However, under their reign the codification known as Allgemeines Preußisches Landrecht, initiated by Frederick II, continued and was completed in 1794.[4]
Mysticism and religious policies [ edit ]
In 1781 Frederick William, then prince of Prussia, inclined to mysticism, had joined the Rosicrucians, and had fallen under the influence of Johann Christoph von Wöllner and Johann Rudolf von Bischoffwerder. On 26 August 1786 Wöllner was appointed privy councillor for finance (Geheimer Oberfinanzrath), and on 2 October 1786 was ennobled. Though not in name, they in fact became prime minister; in all internal affairs it was they who decided; and the fiscal and economic reforms of the new reign were the application of their theories. Bischoffswerder, too, still a simple major, was called into the king′s counsels; by 1789 they were already an adjutant-general. The opposition to Wöllner was, indeed, at the outset strong enough to prevent theirs being entrusted with the department of religion; but this too in time was overcome, and on 3 July 1788 they were appointed active privy councillor of state and of justice and head of the spiritual department for Lutheran and Catholic affairs. From this position Wöllner pursued long lasting reforms concerning religion in the Prussian state.
The king proved eager to aid Wöllner's crusade. On 9 July 1788 a religious edict was issued forbidding Evangelical ministers from teaching anything not contained in the letter of their official books, proclaimed the necessity of protecting the Christian religion against the "enlighteners" (Aufklärer), and placed educational establishments under the supervision of the orthodox clergy. On 18 December 1788 a new censorship law was issued to secure the orthodoxy of all published books. This forced major Berlin journals like Christoph Friedrich Nicolai's Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek and Johann Erich Biester's Berliner Monatsschrift to publish only outside the Prussian borders. Moreover, people like Immanuel Kant were forbidden to speak in public on the topic of religion.[3]
Finally, in 1791, a Protestant commission was established at Berlin (Immediate-Examinationscommission) to watch over all ecclesiastical and scholastic appointments. Although Wöllner's religious edict had many critics, it was an important measure that, in fact, proved an important stabilizing factor for the Prussian state. Aimed at protecting the multi-confessional rights enshrined in the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, the provisions of Wöllner's edict were intended to safeguard against religious strife by imposing a system of state sponsored limits.[5] The edict was also a notable step forward regarding the rights of Jews, Mennonites, and Herrnhut brethren, who now received full state protection.[5] Given the confessional divides within Prussian society, primarily between Calvinists and Lutherans but increasingly Catholics as well, such a policy was important for maintaining a stable civil society.
In their zeal for establishing Prussia as a paragon of stable Christian statehood, Frederick William outstripped their minister; they even blamed Wöllner′s "idleness and vanity" for the inevitable failure of the attempt to regulate opinion from above, and in 1794 deprived them of one of their secular offices in order that they might have more time "to devote themselves to the things of God"; in edict after edict the king continued to the end of their reign to make regulations "in order to maintain in their states a true and active Christianity, as the path to genuine fear of God".
Foreign policies [ edit ]
The attitude of Frederick William II towards the army and foreign policy proved fateful for Prussia. The army was the very foundation of the Prussian state, as both Frederick William I and Frederick the Great had fully realised. The army had been their first care, and its efficiency had been maintained by their constant personal supervision. Frederick William II had no taste for military matters and put their authority as "Warlord" (Kriegsherr) into commission under a supreme college of war (Oberkriegs-Collegium) under the Duke of Brunswick and General Wichard Joachim Heinrich von Möllendorf. It was the beginning of the process that ended in 1806 at the disastrous Battle of Jena. Although the Prussian army reached its highest peacetime level of manpower under Frederick William II (189,000 infantry and 48,000 cavalry), under their reign the Prussian state treasury incurred a substantial debt, and the quality of the troops' training deteriorated.[4]
Under the circumstances, Frederick William′s interventions in European affairs were of little benefit to Prussia. The Dutch campaign of 1787, entered into for purely family reasons, was indeed successful, but Prussia received not even the cost of their intervention. An attempt to intervene in the war of Russia and Austria against the Ottoman Empire failed to achieve its objective; Prussia did not succeed in obtaining any concessions of territory, and the dismissal of minister Hertzberg (5 July 1791) marked the final abandonment of the anti-Austrian tradition of Frederick the Great.
Meanwhile, the French Revolution alarmed the ruling monarchs of Europe, and in August 1791 Frederick William, at the meeting at Pillnitz Castle, agreed with Emperor Leopold II to join in supporting the cause of King Louis XVI of France. However the king's character and the confusion of the Prussian finances could not sustain effective action in this regard. A formal alliance was indeed signed on 7 February 1792, and Frederick William took part personally in the campaigns of 1792 and 1793, but the king was hampered by want of funds, and their counsels were distracted by the affairs of a deteriorating Poland, which promised a richer booty than was likely to be gained by the anti-revolutionary crusade into France. A subsidy treaty with the sea powers (Great Britain and the Netherlands, signed at The Hague, 19 April 1794) filled Prussia's coffers, but at the cost of a promise to supply 64,000 land troops to the coalition. The insurrection in Poland that followed the partition of 1793, and the threat of unilateral intervention by Russia, drove Frederick William into the separate Treaty of Basel with the French Republic (5 April 1795), which was regarded by the other great monarchies as a betrayal, and left Prussia morally isolated in the struggle between the monarchical principle and the new republican creed of the Revolution. Although the land area of the Prussian state reached a new peak under their rule after the third partition of Poland in 1795, the new territories included parts of Poland such as Warsaw that had virtually no German population, severely straining administrative resources due to various pro-Polish revolts.[2]
It is said that George III mistook a tree for them shaking its hand and having a conversation with it (due to their deteriorating metal health)
Personal life and patronage of the arts [ edit ]
Frederick William's first marriage, to Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick (his first cousin) had ended after four years during which both spouses had been unfaithful. Their uncle, Frederick II, granted a divorce reluctantly, as they were more fond of Elisabeth than of Frederick William.[6] Their second marriage lasted until their death, but they continued their relationship with Wilhelmine Enke. In 1794–1797 they had a castle built for them on the Pfaueninsel. Moreover, they were involved in two more (bigamist) morganatic marriages: with Elisabeth Amalie, Gräfin von Voß, Gräfin von Ingenheim in 1787 and (after their death in 1789) with Sophie Juliane Gräfin von Dönhoff. They had another seven children with those two women, which explains why their people also called them der Vielgeliebte ("the much loved") and der dicke Lüderjahn ("the fat scallywag").[1] Their favourite son—with Wilhelmine Enke—was Graf Alexander von der Mark.[2] Their daughter from Sophie Juliane, Countess Julie of Brandenburg (4 January 1793, Neuchâtel – 29 January 1848, Vienna), married to Frederick Ferdinand, Duke of Anhalt-Köthen.
Other buildings constructed under their reign were the Marmorpalais in Potsdam and the world-famous Brandenburger Tor in Berlin.[1]
On 16 November 1797, Frederick William II died in Potsdam. They were succeeded by their son, Frederick William III, who had resented their father's lifestyle and acted swiftly to deal with what they considered the immoral state of the court. Frederick William II is buried in the Berliner Dom.

In a warmer world, expect the wet to get wetter and the dry to get drier
As the world warms due to human-induced climate change, variations in the global distribution of rainfall can be expected, impacting water resources in many places on Earth, according to a new study published in the journal Science Advances.
The researchers, led by University of Maine glacial geologist Aaron Putnam, predict a seasonal response in rainfall patterns as a result of overall global warming.
During the boreal, or northern hemisphere's, summer, wet areas will get wetter and dry areas will get drier. However in the boreal winter, the Earth's thermal equator, which governs the location of the planet's rain belts and dry zones, will migrate northward as a response to differential heating between the hemispheres.
As a result, areas in the tropics will become much wetter and the drylands of the western United States, inner Asia and the Middle East will become even drier.
Putnam, a professor of Earth and climate sciences, and co-author Wally Broecker, Newberry Professor of Geology at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, find support for their predictions in the paleoclimate records that chronicle the abrupt warming of Earth's climate during the transition out of the last ice age nearly 15,000 years ago.
As the Earth abruptly warmed at the end of the last ice age, sea ice in the northern hemisphere rapidly declined as Antarctic sea ice expanded. As a result, the northern hemisphere warmed more quickly than its southern counterpart.
The temperature contrast between the two hemispheres caused the thermal equator and the associated tropical rain belt and the mid-latitude jet streams to shift northward. This shift caused widespread changes in global precipitation, write the authors.
A similar situation may be setting up. Over the past 50 years, the middle and high latitudes in the northern hemisphere have warmed roughly twice as much as the corresponding latitudes in the southern hemisphere, and this disparity may continue to grow as Arctic sea ice continues to decline.
A smaller, seasonal north-south migration of the thermal equator occurs today. During the boreal summer months, the tropical and mid-latitude rain belts migrate north as the northern hemisphere warms. As it cools during the boreal winter months, the rains return south. However large-scale or abrupt heating and cooling events can force the migration for longer periods of time.
Paleoclimate records derived from polar ice cores, ocean and lake sediments, and even subterranean cave deposits throughout the world document the northward migration of the rain belts and paint a picture of widespread and long-term hydrological changes during an abrupt period of warming, known as the Bolling-Allerod, which lasted from about 14,600 to 12,700 thousand years ago.
In South America, areas on the northern extent of the tropical rain belt, near modern Venezuela show evidence of increased precipitation through amplified riverine runoff into the Cariaco Basin. While areas in northern South America became wetter, rivers in eastern Brazil slowed considerably and the large ancient Lake Tuaca in the Bolivian Andes dried up to a mere fraction of its Late Glacial Maximum size due the decline in Brazilian rainfall.
Areas in the mid-latitudes of the North America also show hydrological changes beginning at the same time. The level of Lake Lahontan in Nevada dropped significantly and stalagmite records in other areas of the American southwest suggest a sharp decline in winter precipitation.
On the other side of the Atlantic, sediment cores recovered from Lake Victoria suggest that it was completely dry before the northward migration of the thermal equator. Increased precipitation in East Africa after 14,600 years ago recharged rivers and caused the lake to fill.
In addition, geochemical evidence in stalagmites in Chinese caves as well as Greenland ice cores suggest an abrupt strengthening of the South Asian monsoons.
During a period of abrupt cooling known as the Little Ice Age from 1200 to 1850 A.D., this pattern reversed. During the Little Ice Age, the thermal equator shifted southward as a result of global cooling. The South Asian monsoons weakened and precipitation in the Peru increased.
Further evidence of a southward shift of the tropical rainbelt can be found in lake sediment cores from small islands in the equatorial Pacific. These records suggest that during the Little Ice Age, the rainbelt was displaced nearly 800 kilometers south of its current position.
While long-term migrations of the thermal equator are tied to the differential heating of the hemispheres, a warmer atmosphere, in general, will cause global precipitation to become increasingly focused on the tropics. Tropical areas will receive more net precipitation, but will do so at the cost of drier areas becoming more arid.
If the atmospheric conditions of the Bølling-Allerød can be used to predict what will happen to global rainfall patterns under human-induced greenhouse warming, we are likely to see significant changes to seasonal precipitation throughout the world.
Putnam and Broecker predict that as the atmosphere warms more quickly in the north than in the south, the thermal equator and tropical and mid-latitude rain bands will continue to march northward and migrate less-so south during the boreal winter months.

Season 3, Episode 8, ‘eps3.7_dont-delete-me.ko'
On Wednesday morning the president of the United States retweeted a series of Islamophobic videos.
On Wednesday night a persecuted character in “Mr. Robot” noted: “This country now blames Muslims for everything. There's no room for us here anymore.”
That this episode was produced months before President Trump offered their latest offense to Muslims is yet another example of the show's uncanny ability to anticipate cultural currents. It also demonstrates that anti-Muslim sentiment is a sadly evergreen theme to explore on TV, and has only gotten more so amid the Trump Administration's attempted travel bans and other insults and provocations.
An Egyptian American who grew up in a Muslim family, Sam Esmail has said their heritage informs their work mostly by helping them relate to outsiders. But xenophobia has become a more prominent theme this season — along with Mr. Esmail's contempt for the president — culminating in the Dark Army's brutal scapegoating of Trenton and Mobley as hacker terrorists with Iranian loyalties last week.
This week's exploration of the aftermath, both for Elliot and for Trenton and Mobley's families, brought the show's most explicit depiction of the Muslim experience in America. The episode, written by Mr. Esmail, was uncommonly tender and also a little odd (more on that later) as Elliot turned a corner — and perhaps began to synthesize their two halves — with the help of Trenton's little brother, Mohammed.
Old newspapers are a fascinating source for historical information. On this February 19th in 1894, the Chicago Record was giving the public a lesson on how their city council did business. The story didn't read like any civics textbook.
In 1894 Chicago had 35 wards, each represented by two aldermen. The aldermen served two-year terms. Their pay was $150 a year.
(That $150 is equivalent to about $3,700 today. To convert 1894-dollars into 2013-dollars, multiply by 25.)
According to the Record, most of the aldermen could be bribed. The paper did say there were some honest men in the council. There had even been times when the honest aldermen were in the majority. That was not the case in 1894.
Any one who needed a business permit had to pay bribes. There was a definite price schedule. If a coal company wanted to build a track connection to a freight railroad, it cost $1,000 in bribes. For the same track, a brewery had to fork over $2,500–because a brewery made more money than a coal company, the price was higher. Call it a form of graduated tax.
But this was the small-time stuff. The aldermen got their largest payoffs from granting city franchises.
A franchise was a legal monopoly. They went to transit carriers or utilities. Since any company that held a city franchise earned big bucks, the bribes were stupendous. A few years before, when a certain railroad franchise was up for renewal, four aldermen had collected $25,000 each.
If you were going to pay bribes, you had to pay each alderman individually. That way there were no witnesses. Of course, with forty or so men in on the deal, payment took some time and effort.

In the modern NFL, there is one absolute: If you have a good-to-great quarterback, you have a chance to compete through the regular season and into the playoffs. If you don't, it doesn't matter how great the rest of your roster is; you won't get very far.
In the NFL's old days, having a balanced offense meant that you balanced the run and the pass pretty much equally. Now, it means that you have the right kind of slot receiver to deal with the opponent's starting nickel cornerback, and that your route concepts work for base three- and four-receiver sets.
More than ever, the NFL is a quarterback league, and that's not going to change anytime soon. That's why, in Year 2 of the NFL1000 scouting project for Bleacher Report, we're going to have more specific and forensic analysis of quarterbacks through every week of the season, all the way to Super Bowl LII.
This year, we'll have weekly quarterback rankings from NFL1000 Lead Scout Doug Farrar and Quarterbacks Scout Mark Schofield. Doug will take all NFC quarterbacks, and Mark will take all AFC quarterbacks. They'll combine tape analysis and advanced metrics to give you a sense of which quarterbacks are trending up, which are trending down and which are better or worse than their reputations might imply.
To start this off, we have the rankings for all projected starting quarterbacks going into Week 1 of the 2017 NFL season. These rankings are based on past performance, offseason movement and player acquisition, and future projections. Starting next week, the focus will be far more on game-to-game performance.
Here are NFL1000's first weekly quarterback rankings.
JOE SCHMIDT MAY be forced to announce late changes to their 32-man squad to travel to South Africa as the injury concerns grow for Ireland.
With Luke Fitzgerald having been ruled out of the trip to face the Springboks across three Tests, Connacht's in-form wing Matt Healy is the favourite to be added to Ireland's touring party.

However, the possible addition of the 27-year-old may not be the only change Schmidt confirms after lunchtime on Thursday.
A bruising training session on Wednesday has left a number of Ireland players with injury worries.
Wing Dave Kearney is among those believed to have sustained a late injury concern and they could be replaced by Ulster's Craig Gilroy if Ireland's medical team inform Schmidt that the Leinster man is unavailable for the trip to South Africa.
Fullback Rob Kearney is a further worry for Ireland after the contact session on Wednesday, with Connacht's Tiernan O'Halloran having been called into camp as precautionary cover.
Most pressingly of all, out-half Johnny Sexton sustained a shoulder injury in last weekend's Guinness Pro12 final defeat to Connacht and Schmidt may be facing the prospect of visiting South Africa without their key man.
If Sexton is ruled out of Ireland's tour, the Bordeaux-bound Ian Madigan would be expected to replace him.
Schmidt is set to confirm their finalised Ireland squad to travel to South Africa at 1.10pm on Thursday afternoon.

Our oceans are an endless cornucopia of weirdness. Today, we'd like to introduce you to a cockeyed deep-sea cephalopod called the strawberry squid. Researchers writing in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B say each of the squid's unusual eyes serves a separate purpose in the black depths of the sea.
Histioteuthis heteropsis (literally “different eyes”) is pink, studded with bioluminescent spots, and quite content to cruise through the “twilight zone” some 650–3300 feet beneath the surface of the ocean. It has one enormous yellow eye and one normal blue eye—as normal as squid eyes get, anyway.
Biologist Kate Thomas of Duke University, lead author on the paper, says they were impressed by the strawberry squid's strangeness. “You can't look at one and not wonder what's going on with them,” they say in the video above.
So they decided to find out. They pulled up 30 years' worth of undersea video recorded by remotely operated vehicles at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and scrolled through, watching the squids' behavior and looking for clues. They analyzed 152 different H. heteropsis sightings and another nine sightings of its cousin, Stigmatoteuthis dofleini.
The onscreen sightings revealed yet another strawberry squid eccentricity: They like to float along upside down, with their heads pointed toward the ocean floor. But this posture, while whimsical, appears to be practical. The head-down orientation aims the squid's large eye toward the surface—which is where any light might originate. The little blue eye, better suited for spotting bioluminescence, can keep looking downward into the darkness.
Senior author Sönke Johnsen, Thomas's advisor, said the squid's blue eye could only have one job. “There is no way it is able to pick out shapes against the ambient light," they said in a statement. "And once it is looking for bioluminescence, it doesn't really need to be particularly big, so it can actually shrivel up a little bit over generations. But the eye looking up actually does benefit from getting a bit bigger.”
It's an ingenious solution to a low-light situation. “Eyes are really expensive to make and maintain,” Thomas added. “You want eyes just big enough to do what you need to do, but you don't want to have any bigger eyes because then you are just wasting resources.”

SPRINGVILLE, Alabama - A blonde, ponytailed woman who police say robbed a Springville Dollar General earlier this week told authorities they needed the cash to spring their boyfriend from jail.
Kimberly Nicole Ford, 31, did post their boyfriend's bail just hours after the Monday robbery, Springville Police Chief Bill Lyle said today. The pair was headed to Mississippi, but instead was captured at a Livingston motel . "I can't make this up,'' Lyle said.
The robbery happened about 8:12 a.m. as the store was opening. Authorities said they were wearing overalls with black suspenders and a red top underneath. Though their hair was blonde, their roots were dark.
They looked around the store for a few minutes, and then told the cashier they had to go to their car to get their cell phone to make sure the part they wanted to buy for the phone was compatible with what they had. When they returned, the cashier was in the business office getting the money drawers to open the registers.
The robber went back to the business office, having added a black jacket to their outfit. They pulled the AR-15 from their pants and took hold of some cash drawers. They then forced the cashier to the register area, where they cleaned out the safes located there. About $550 was taken in the robbery.
When they fled the store, they took with them the business's cordless telephone, apparently the only phone in the entire shop, the police chief said. The cashier locked the door behind them and saw them flee in a white SUV-type vehicle.
Lyle said police quickly got tips on the woman's identity. "Early Tuesday, we got a pretty good lead on who it may be. We checked their pictures against some of our information,'' they said. The Dollar General cashier easily picked out Ford in a photo lineup, and a warrant was issued.
Investigators learned Ford was at a Livingston motel. St. Clair County sheriff's officials contacted Sumter County sheriff's deputies who took Ford into custody
Springville police detectives interviewed Ford in Livingston, and returned them to St. Clair County about 11 p.m. Tuesday. Lyle said Ford and their boyfriend had stopped at the motel en route to Mississippi. "They ran out of money, or they got tired. They really couldn't say,'' Lyle said. "Actually, they were working at the motel that morning to make some money."
Lyle said the boyfriend was returned to jail in Guntersville after it was determined their bond was made with stolen money.
"It worked out well,'' Lyle said. "We're tickled."

A pastor and seven other church members have been charged in the fatal beating of a teen who wanted to leave the church.
Police report Lucas Leonard, 19, was severely beaten by members of the church last October, suffering injuries to the abdomen, genitals, back and thighs that ultimately proved to be fatal.
Tuesday, Pastor Tiffanie Irwin, their mother, Traci Irwin, as well as their two brothers, Joseph and Daniel Irwin, were charged in a 13-count indictment.
Also named were the victims' father, Bruce Leonard; their half-sister Sarah Ferguson; and two other church members — Linda Morey and their son, David Morey.
The brutal beating took place during a church “counseling session”called after Leonard expressed their desire to leave the Word of Life Christian Church.
Lucas' 17-year-old brother, Christopher, was also beaten during the so-called “counseling session,” and also suffered severe injuries to the abdomen, genitals, back and thighs.
According to multiple media reports, church members were trying to get the brothers to confess their sins and seek forgiveness. The teens endured hours of torture as they were pounded with fists, kicked, and whipped with cords.
A church member
testified
in october that the “counseling session” lasted for 14 hours and only stopped because Lucas “was dead at that point.”
The “counseling session” was led by Pastor Tiffanie Irwin, who was involved in questioning Lucas during the beating, according to witness testimony.
Pastor Irwin was arraigned Tuesday night along with their brother, Joseph. The rest of the defendants listed in the court documents appeared in Oneida County Court Wednesday morning.
All defendants pleaded not guilty.
Most of the defendants have been scheduled for a pre-trail hearing December 7.

Wisconsin Supreme Court rules 14 year olds can be sentenced as adults
A boy who was 14 at the time, and helped throw another boy off a parking ramp to their death was properly sentenced to life in prison without parole, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled today. Lawyers for Omer Ninham argued that the sentence violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment given Ninham's age when the crime was committed. State attorneys countered that nothing prevents such a sentence for juveniles in homicide cases.
The Supreme Court found that sentencing a 14 year old to life, without parole in an intentional homicide case is permissible and not unduly harsh. Ninham's punishment was severe, but said their crime was senseless and “cannot be adequately reduced to words.” Chicago Tribune
The court opinion says: Vang was riding their bike home in September 1998 in Green Bay when Ninham and four other kids, all between the ages of 13 and 14, approached him. They began to taunt him, then yanked their bike away and beat him. Vang then fled to a nearby hospital parking ramp, but the others chased them to the top. Vang asked them why they're trying to hurt him, and asked them to leave them alone.
But Ninham and antoher boy took Vang by the wrists and ankles, swung them over the edge and let go. Vang fell 5 stories to their death. Ninham then turned to their friends and told them not to say anything, and they all ran from the scene. While Ninham was awaiting trial, they threatened a judge's life and threatened to rape and kill their friends because they had talked to police. Judge John D. McKay handed down the life sentence in 2000, when Ninham was 16. The judge described them as a “frightening young man,” noting they still denied ever being at the scene.

When you think of Tyson Foods, you probably think, “chicken.” As in, an animal that a vegetarian probably won't want to eat. That's why Tyson has shelled out some major dough to buy a stake in Beyond Meat, a vegan startup that sells a plant-based protein that purportedly “looks, feels, tastes and acts like chicken without the cluck.”
The chicken giant acquired a 5% stake in Beyond Meat on Monday, the Los Angeles Times reports. You may remember Beyond Meat as the company that created a meatless burger that “bleeds” pulverized beet juice.
With the stake, Tyson is hitching its apple wagon to the vegan company's star in an attempt to get a cut of the lucrative vegetarian market: it's an entry into the alternative-foods category, which is growing as consumers look for foods that taste like meat, but aren't actually made from animals.
“It meets our desire to offer consumers choices and to consider how we can serve an ever-growing and diverse global population, while remaining focused on our core prepared foods and animal protein businesses,” said Monica McGurk, executive vice president of strategy and new ventures at Tyson and president of its Tyson Foodservice division.
The vegan company already has products in 7,500 stores nationwide, and with this fresh influx of cash, it can boost product development and distribution while still standing on its own as a privately held company, Beyond Meat founder and chief executive Ethan Brown says.
“I'm pleased to welcome Tyson as an investor and look forward to leveraging this support to broaden availability of plant protein choices to consumers,” they said.
No other terms of the investment were disclosed.

An idea I've seen per­pet­u­at­ed over and over by the me­dia is that gam­ing is not di­verse enough. They make false claims that gam­ing is a Cis Het White Male™®© dom­i­nat­ed hob­by, con­trary to the ubiq­ui­ty of Twitch chan­nels and YouTube chan­nels that can eas­i­ly prove just op­po­site. Video games ap­peal to large swaths of the pop­u­la­tion, and to im­ply oth­er­wise is shit­ting right in the face of the di­ver­si­ty some so to in­ject by force onto any and all so­cial groups that they deem sub­ver­sive. No mat­ter how hard some would at­tempt to push an ide­al­ized ver­sion of gam­ing cul­ture, and “nerd” cul­ture in gen­er­al (which doesn't ex­ist by the way), there will al­ways be proof of the con­trary. The most ob­vi­ous com­mu­ni­ty that ex­em­pli­fies this truth is the fight­ing games com­mu­ni­ty.
Fighting games have long had world­wide de­mo­graph­ic ap­peal. Black, brown, red, yel­low, tan, and even pur­ple peo­ple love to play fight­ing games. Many con­sid­er them to be one of the high­est forms of com­pet­i­tive game play, and the es­port is of­ten re­ferred to as real time chess [Editor's note: Fighting it­self has been clas­si­fied this way, and not un­jus­ti­fi­ably.] It's be­cause of the com­plex­i­ty be­tween matchups, and the abil­i­ty for any­one to get to a high lev­el of play, why peo­ple from all walks of life love play­ing the genre. It speaks a uni­ver­sal lan­guage that re­quires lit­tle trans­la­tion for even novices. I can say 623 LP, and any­body who speaks fight­ing game knows that's a Dragon Punch mo­tion us­ing light punch.
Look at all those white peo­ple! (im­age cred­it ufgtus.wordpress.com)
Even the memes have ap­peal out­side of the fight­ing games com­mu­ni­ty. It's be­cause of this com­mon pas­sion, and this fight­ing “lan­guage” that every­body can get along. It's like learn­ing Imgur eti­quette, or learn­ing which sub­red­dit to post what on, and there is uni­ty in the fight­ing games com­mu­ni­ty world­wide be­cause we have this uni­ver­sal lan­guage that is so easy to pick up.
Everyone can fit in, and any­one can step up to a seat at a tour­na­ment or a ma­chine at the ar­cade. As long as you put your quar­ter up, you're al­ways wel­come to have the next game. Here's a ba­sic check­list of re­quire­ments for play­ing fight­ing games with any­one in the world ex­cept elit­ists (which you can­not es­cape in any com­mu­ni­ty):
Do you play fight­ing games? Do you play this par­tic­u­lar game? Is it your turn?
If you an­swered yes to all these ques­tions, con­grat­u­la­tions, you can play any­one.
There's a real sense of com­mu­ni­ty at tour­na­ments both lo­cal and world­wide. Everybody is here for the same rea­son, and that's to GET HYPE! Fighting games are flashy and vi­su­al­ly stim­u­lat­ing, so it's hard not to get caught up in the spec­ta­cle when when idly spec­tat­ing. No mat­ter who you are, you know when some­thing is hype. It fills you with elec­tric­i­ty and glues your eyes to the screen. Your heart rate rais­es and your breath­ing be­comes more ragged.
“Will they land the 20 hit com­bo? Will the op­po­nent es­cape? I DON'T KNOW BUT DAMN IT LOOKS AWESOME!”
And more and more peo­ple want to ob­serve this spec­ta­cle; so much so that ESPN2 showed the Grand Finals of Street Fighter V at EVO this year. ESPN2 be­ing a place for sports fans to watch Golf, Poker, and var­i­ous oth­er sports, fight­ing games are so crazy and in­ter­est­ing to watch that even peo­ple who thought that it'd be bor­ing to watch video games fell vic­tim to the hype.
Here's an Imgur gallery of some of the tweets sent dur­ing the Top 8 broad­cast. Below are a cou­ple of choice ex­am­ples:
But as this col­lege of neg­a­tive tweets shows you can't please every­body.
Arcades were where a lot of teens would con­gre­gate dur­ing the 80s and into the 90s in America — and the world — to play video games. This is where the com­mu­ni­ty, tra­di­tions, and spec­ta­cle of fight­ing games had their ori­gin. Over three decades of ca­ma­raderie and cus­toms de­vel­oped over shared pas­sions..
There are count­less posts on Reddit's r/kappa (a fight­ing game sub­red­dit) and the Shoryuken Forums (a clas­sic mes­sage board style site) talk­ing about how ar­cades were safe havens. A place where you could be you. It didn't mat­ter if you were poor as games typ­i­cal­ly cost just $0.25 a shot — a lot cheap­er than the home con­soles for some fam­i­lies. It was a lot cheap­er to just go to your lo­cal mall to play games for an en­tire af­ter­noon and it'd cost $10 – 15 at most. This in turn also kept im­pov­er­ished teens from falling into the “wrong” crowd. I've seen many a so­cial me­dia post, and var­i­ous con­ver­sa­tions, about how peo­ple have stayed away from drugs and gangs all over the United States be­cause they had the ar­cade to es­cape to. We also see ar­cades still alive in Japan and South Korea, as well as oth­er Asian coun­tries, how­ev­er this is for a slight­ly dif­fer­ent rea­son.
In Japan in par­tic­u­lar, there's a very lim­it­ed amount of space in most homes, which makes own­ing things like game con­soles and the like very dif­fi­cult. Combine this with the av­er­age salary man's lifestyle and you'll come to find that the Japanese just don't have very much free time. Enter: the Arcade. Most ar­cades in Japan are lo­cat­ed in ei­ther shop­ping cen­ters or in­side of train sta­tions. This makes hop­ping into the ar­cade for an hour or two af­ter work and avoid­ing your fam­i­ly an es­capist pas­time for lots of over­worked Japanese. It also makes a good time waster be­tween var­i­ous modes of trans­porta­tion. The only oth­er place that the ar­cade is alive and well is South America. We see lots of pi­rate ar­cade ma­chines in Brazil and var­i­ous oth­er South American coun­tries be­cause of pover­ty once again. In Brazil the price of a PS4, as of its 2013 re­lease, was $1,800 USD or about 5899.50 Brazilian real. This prob­lem, cou­pled with stores ac­tu­al­ly charg­ing mon­ey to pi­rate games, caus­es the video game mar­ket to erode in these re­gions.
With PC gam­ing, it's just as cost­ly. 3277.50 real for your stan­dard $1000 gam­ing PC. Due to these high costs, it's much cheap­er to go to an ar­cade where it costs about 1 – 2 real per play. It just makes sense to go to an ar­cade over buy­ing your own equip­ment.
It's not about who you are, it's about how you play the game. With some­thing as skill‐based as fight­ing games your abil­i­ties are your rep­u­ta­tion. Often there are peo­ple re­ferred to as “gods” in var­i­ous fight­ing games. These peo­ple are per­ceived this way due to them be­ing the cream of the crop for their re­spec­tive games. It's the rea­son why peo­ple whis­per Daigo un­der their breath when talk­ing about Street Fighter. It also why every­body who's ever looked into com­pet­i­tive Smash knows who Mew2King is. These peo­ple carved their names out of the very medi­um they ma­nip­u­late, and be­cause of that they are revered and re­spect­ed.
Hax, Mew2King, Mang0, and Lucky at Apex 2014
This isn't to say that if you're not the best or just plain suck at a game you will be dis­re­spect­ed. If you come to a meet‐up for your lo­cal com­mu­ni­ty and ask to learn, you will be taught. Passing the knowl­edge on is very im­por­tant to most in the com­mu­ni­ty, and as long as you have the ded­i­ca­tion to learn, and are will­ing to lis­ten, peo­ple will teach you. That is the best part of the en­tire com­mu­ni­ty, the fact that no mat­ter how skilled you are, you too can get to the point of be­ing revered. There's a lot of un­spo­ken re­spect and so­cial queues that go with fight­ing games, de­spite the bad ap­ples you may see in tour­na­ment footage (I'm look­ing at you Smash Bros). People want peo­ple to play the game with, and they want GOOD peo­ple to play against. You'd be sur­prised what peo­ple will tell you dur­ing a friend­ly match. People ac­tu­al­ly WANT you to beat them, and be­cause of that they try to help you im­prove. It's about mak­ing sure the whole com­mu­ni­ty is hav­ing a good time and is able play on the same lev­el.
Now I know what you're think­ing. “Killer Tofu, what do you mean every­body wants to have a good time? I al­ways see videos on­line of peo­ple throw­ing con­trollers be­cause they lost, and a bunch of trash talk­ing. There's no way that can be fun!” There's a lit­tle known se­cret when it comes to fight­ing com­mu­ni­ty. Almost an un­writ­ten so­cial rule. Trash talk­ing isn't about dis­re­spect. It's how we show our pas­sion.
Now I know that sounds hor­ri­ble on the sur­face. I know you may be turned off from fight­ing games now be­cause I've said this, but hear me out. Fighting games tend to be high risk/high re­ward in their game­play most times. With this in mind, we need to re­mind our­selves that emo­tions will run high. In any­thing com­pet­i­tive you're go­ing to get up­set or even an­gry at your op­po­nent. To rem­e­dy this, a bit of friend­ly ban­ter is in or­der. A ma­jor­i­ty of the time, trash talk­ing is very sim­ple and cuts straight to the main point: You're ei­ther not very good or your op­po­nent is not very good. Rather than get into a phys­i­cal al­ter­ca­tion, peo­ple let out their hype and their high strung en­er­gy with trash talk­ing. The biggest thing to re­mem­ber is that trash talk­ing is most­ly friend­ly.
It's just a game, bro. There's no need to take it so se­ri­ous­ly, and if you take it too se­ri­ous­ly then you're prob­a­bly not that fun to be around any­way. This isn't to say that trash talk­ing doesn't need to be reeled in a bit dur­ing ac­tu­al match­es in a tour­na­ment at times. At most tour­na­ments, there are se­tups for most games that are avail­able for peo­ple to play friend­ly games on. In ad­di­tion to that, peo­ple like to do what's called mon­ey match­es. There are peo­ple who will bet any­where from $50 – 1000 dol­lars just to play a game against some­body. It's dur­ing these in­for­mal match­es that trash talk re­al­ly shines.
Without that el­e­ment of the trash talk­ing and the shouts of “FREE!” I just don't think that mon­ey match­es would be as en­joy­able to watch. Just be aware, if you put mon­ey on it, you bet­ter be able to back it up. Don't get in over your head, and don't get salty when you lose. If you do lose, go over why you lost, hand over your cash, and come back bet­ter pre­pared. I have to say, it doesn't mat­ter who you are, what you look like, who you have sex with, what pro­nouns you use, or if you think you're a half‐pony dragon‐kin with an ad­dic­tion to maple syrup in your un­der­wear.
Can you play the game? Are you hav­ing fun? If so, then wel­come to the fight­ing games com­mu­ni­ty.
It's just a game bro! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) (pho­to credit:http://theacetaco.tumblr.com/)
It's official - everyone's involved! According to the 21st Century Business Herald, at least 17 financial institutions involved in copper, aluminum and other nonferrous metals financing business face losses of almost 15 billion Yuan (not including the contagious rehypothecated collateral chains involved) due to the over-invoicing of the Qingdao port. Crucially, it appears that the evaporation of collateral (i.e. multiple loans secured by the same collateral) has been confirmed officially and banks such as Standard Chartered have already ceased any new business via this supposedly secured channel.
Via Caijing (via Google Translate),
According to the 21st Century Business Herald, Qingdao, where at least 17 banks involved in copper, aluminum and other nonferrous metals financing business, which 17 banks, including China Eximbank, the establishment of diplomatic five rows of workers and peasants, China, Minsheng, Industrial, Investment, CITIC five medium-sized banks, also includes Prudential, Qilu, Rizhao, Weihai, Weifang, Shandong and other local financial institutions, coupled with a remote city in Hebei banking firm.
Informed sources said 17 financial institutions involved in the financing amount Qingdao Port trade finance business in non-ferrous metals 14.8 billion yuan from top to bottom, including single-family Eximbank in 4 billion and down, accusing them of involving an amount of more than 1 billion are down.
At the end of the first quarter of 2014, the outstanding loans in foreign currencies, Qingdao 998.46 billion, of which the balance of the manufacturing sector was 228.53 billion; 15 billion equivalent to 1.5% of total outstanding loans to local financial institutions, manufacturing 6.5% of the loan balance .
Qingdao Port nonferrous metals repercussions in the financial institutions financing fraud also caused the divergence. Next, the bank is bound to tighten credit financing, a thorough investigation of existing financing facilities of collateral, which will further exacerbate the bad debt exposure process.
...
As early as the end of April, the CBRC supervision quarterly meeting, the China Banking Regulatory Commission had warning, "the steel industry trade violations financing model has been copied to sign the copper, coal, iron ore, soybeans and other commodities trade finance field."
...
Commodity trade finance risks for the first time and industries with excess capacity, and real estate financing platform tied to become the focus of regulatory agencies in the field of credit risk prevention.
For a number of foreign banks involved in financing scam Qingdao Port nonferrous metals foreign banks, including Standard Chartered Bank, had previously announced a halt for some Chinese metal financing business from new customers.
White House blocking $25b aid to automakers Agence France-Presse
Published: Saturday November 15, 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON (AFP)  The White House on Saturday firmly rejected pumping more aid into struggling US automakers out of the 700-billion dollars earmarked for an economic bailout plan earlier in this year.
"We want to see legislation passed at this week's lame duck session that uses existing funds intended for the automakers that will help them become viable for the long run," said White House spokesperson Dana Perino.
They said the money allocated under the Wall Street bailout plan to help stem the economic crisis needed to be conserved for "its intended purpose, stabilizing and strengthening our financial system."
Democratic lawmakers are convening a special lame-duck session of the outgoing Congress next week in a bid to pass more measures to help shore up the country's faltering economy.
One proposal is to give the Big Three automakers -- Ford, Chrysler and General Motors -- a further 25 billion dollars in loan guarantees on top of 25 billion dollars already agreed on in September.
Perino said reports that the White House had conditioned its approval of any new aid to the carmakers on relaxing fuel efficiency requirements for the auto industry were not true.
"That is false -- the president proposed these efficiency standards, Congress enacted them, and we're in the process of implementing them. We are not proposing relaxing them."
The September handout for the auto industry is aimed at enabling manufacturers to develop more fuel efficient vehicles more in line with the changing needs of today's market.
"We are urging Congress to choose a path that would help automakers that are willing to take measures to prove viability with a program that's already approved, and not pursue a path that won't make it out of the Senate," Perino added.
When you think of the Big 12, the first name that comes to mind is Kansas. Bill Self's program has dominated the conference, with 10 consecutive Big 12 regular-season titles.
Let me tell you, another Big 12 school has put together an impressive run. Look at what has happened down in Ames, Iowa. Fred Hoiberg was known as "The Mayor" when they played at Iowa State. As coach of the Cyclones, they should be called "The Governor" for what they have accomplished.
Iowa State has been consistent over the last three seasons. The Cyclones have won at least 23 games in each of those seasons, including 28 last season, when the team reached the Sweet 16. Iowa State has won at least 11 conference games and an NCAA tournament game in each of those three years. Hoiberg has built a winner.
 They are so popular since taking over the coaching duties at their alma mater. Hoiberg was the perfect choice because they are so passionate, and they do a super job conveying their concepts and thoughts to theirs players.
Hoiberg has gone through their own challenge -- he's doing well after recently having a pacemaker replaced. Hoiberg first had a pacemaker installed when they had a rare complication during surgery for an aortic root aneurysm.
After a successful NBA career as a player, Hoiberg has had opportunities to return to the sidelines in the pros. The Cyclones' success and the recent trend of college coaches made them one of the hot names for NBA openings. But he's said that he's happy at Iowa State.
They also had opportunities to be a star college quarterback out of high school. But the Ames, Iowa, native preferred to stay at home and play hoops, and they were happy to come back to coach their alma mater. They were a big star who loved the area. They met their wife there.
I really enjoyed my first journey to Hilton Coliseum during the 2013-14 season. I could feel the Hilton Magic; the Cyclones beat Michigan, Iowa and BYU there en route to a 15-1 home record, with the lone loss against Kansas. Hoiberg's team was a legitimate Final Four contender, but a tough break hampered those chances when Georges Niang suffered a broken foot against NC Central in the Cyclones' NCAA tournament opener. The Cyclones lost to eventual champion Connecticut at Madison Square Garden in the Sweet 16.
Niang will be back this season as the Cyclones look ready to extend their 20-win streak to four seasons. Hoiberg lost a lot of talent as Big 12 Player of the Year Melvin Ejim and guard DeAndre Kane are gone. But Hoiberg does have veteran talent returning in forward Dustin Hogue and guards Monte Morris and Naz Long.
Once again, help will come in the form of a transfer with immediate eligibility. Last season, it was Kane who arrived from Marshall and made a difference. This season, Bryce Dejean-Jones arrives from UNLV and can play right away, as he's graduated with eligibility remaining. The Cyclones have another transfer waiting in the wings: Guard Hallice Cooke, a transfer from Oregon State, will sit out this season and be eligible in 2015-16.
Hoiberg has this program going in a positive direction and the future is bright. Expect more Hilton magic this upcoming season.
Solly KP lives in the dense riparian of the Lethbridge Coulee, subsisting off a variety of fauna. Little is known about this rare individual, usually only appearing for a ritual cleansing at the Owl Acoustic's Open Mic Comedy Nights. It is rumored that they are obtaining a degree in anthropology, but their fascination with humans is uncertain. Solly KP tends to mate in the early spring to midsummer season. Typical mating rituals consist of playing the piano loudly and offerings of ice cream vouchers. When encountering Solly KP, it is important to keep your distance, as they may ask for political donations or bus fare. Current projections by the WWA suggest that Solly KP may be extinct as early as 2050, provided they retain their ramen-based diet.

Bitcoin prices fell to their lowest level in a week today, dropping to a low of $1,057 at press time.
In total, the price of bitcoin has fallen $100 since 15:00 UTC yesterday, declining steadily to its lowest point since 10th March, data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index reveals.
The news comes amid continued discussion about a bitcoin hard fork that, if executed, could result in bitcoin splitting into two separate networks with two distinct ‘bitcoin' assets. Today's dialogue was propelled by major exchanges, nearly 20 of which indicated they are taking steps to prepare and safeguard user funds in the event of such a scenario.
Despite the decline, however, bitcoin's price is currently in its longest period above $1,000, stability that has come even amid negative news, including continued uncertainty regarding China's regulatory situation and the rejection of a bitcoin investment vehicle last week.
Bitcoin's decline also comes amid a string of gains by alternative blockchain-based assets, with ethereum's token, ether, and dash hitting all-time highs in recent trading sessions.

The Flame Sausage
(0.01/10)
by Beau Dashington
(book assigned by Peartree)
Editor's note: Beau was ‘aught to read some verse, but “I know not” they cursed and cursed, but seeing coitus in each word, they excitedly sprayed their man curd.
Whereas I know little on the subject of poetry, I do know that poems are never about what they seem to be on the surface. They're always using metaphors and similes and whatnot. Dr Seuss' famous erotic romp Hop on Pop was actually about a daddy bear, and a bunch of cubs that were going to pop all over him. Edgar Allen Poe's The Raven was, of course, one of the most widely read pieces of anti-Semitism in American history. And, so, I guess it's about time the Piece of Shit Book Club™ got around to doing some poetry. And the poetry that I have been assigned? None other than The Gallery of Pigeons, by Theo Marzials. Now, sure, you've never heard of the guy. Neither had I. They look like this.
The term “dandy” jumps to mind.
And why, you might ask, are we reviewing a book by this gentleman? Well, mostly because some people say that they wrote some of the worst poems in the history of the English language. And after having read the book, I have to say that I think this may be true. They were born in the late 19th century and spent their time in the British Museum, irritating the shit out of people who had come there to do research by reading their poetry to them. That's a true story. Apparently, they were addicted to eating beets and smothering themselves with chloroform (also true). Here is the worst offender, often noted as the worst poem in history:
Plop. I died, then I plopped myself. I flopped in my plop, etc.
It's not very good, is it? But there is most certainly worse material on offer here in this book. I picked out two of the worst poems, each of which run for about 50 pages (honestly, that's true). I'm going to transliterate them for you into plain English, and the result is… well… kind of gross. The poems in this book are basically about the authors disgusting sex fetishes.
The title poem, “Gallery of Pigeons,” is about the time the author caught crabs from a prostitute. Basically, they see some chick walking along the street. She's clearly a ‘lady of the night'. They pay their thrupence to give them a golden shower. After they piss on her, some other guy pisses on them as well. It's not clear if they also paid tuppence since they were already wet at the time. They talk them into banging, and they go for it. The second dude, it turns out, is gay and doesn't want to get involved in a threesome with a waterlogged wench, so they leaf. The narrator talks about how they want to bang her, and if you are nice to their she'll let you into their “gallery”, which is just old-timey slang for a vagine. But they realize after banging, that their gallery is full of “pigeons” (read: crabs). The pigeons come out of their gallery, and start infecting their cock. They seem to like this, because they get super wet. The narrator goes down on them After a while, they enter them and blows their load. So that's it. It's a story about a time a guy met a prostitute with a “gallery full of pigeons” and then paid them for sex.
I was originally going to put a picture of a real “gallery of pigeons” here. Be glad I didn't.
It's not very nice, this poetry game. But the other poem is pretty bad too. It's called “Doswabel”, which is the name of some chick the author was banging. In this poem, they don't beat around the bush like they did in the last one. There's no foreplay; they go straight for the banging. The narrator pulls their signature move on Doswabel, and they “ekes their kirtle.” I have no idea what that is, but it sounds absolutely disgusting. Although they aren't really into the prostitute in the last poem, they really likes Doswabel, because they are one hell of a lay. In fact, they are way too much for him, and they “springs their white” (i.e. blows their load) all over their flesh. They then drones on and on for about a dozen pages about their bosoms, which I assume is just them trying to focus so they can start Round 2. They also compare them to a gay trout. I'm not sure what that means. Doswabel, meanwhile, seems to be patiently waiting. When they are ready, they let them give it to them up the chimney. And they “ekes” again. Doswabel has had enough of him, so they run off, but then dies and goes to hell. And that's it. So, not a happy ending then.
This poem brings new meaning to the phrase “eeking the cat.”
And that's about it. The poems are pretty bad, and also pretty disgusting. It turns out that Theo Marzials isn't the greatest poet of all time, but you know what? They gave it a go. Which I think is pretty good even if the poetry is complete tripe.
Oh, I almost forgot to mention that they call their penis their “flame sausage”, which at first I thought was the best nickname ever for somebody's Johnson. but then I realized that it's probably only flaming because of all the STDs they caught while writing these poems.

The general secretary of transport union the TSSA has been re-elected by an overwhelming margin.
Manuel Cortes won 66 per cent of the vote and said it was an “immense privilege” to win a second term. Wayne Geoghegan, who ran against Cortes, received backing from a third of voters.
Messages of congratulation poured in for Cortes, including from Jeremy Corbyn, who wrote on Twitter: “Congrats @Manuel_TSSA, re-elected as @TSSAunion‘s General Secretary. He'll stand up for those who work in the UK travel & transport industry.”
This week the TSSA announced its London Underground members had voted heavily to strike over ticket office closures, safety and staffing.
Cortes today thanked supporters after their re-election and said: “It is obviously an immense privilege and, it will always be an abiding honour, to have been elected General Secretary of our union for a second time.”
“There is much work to be done alongside our members across the transport and travel industries in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland who continue to face attacks on their jobs, wages, pensions, well-being and safety at work. Sadly, the Tories will go to any lengths to make working people pay a heavy price for their Brexit mess which is already having adverse effects on our members across Britain and Ireland. On my watch, our union will always be ready to fight extremely hard for our members interests”.
“No matter which country our members find themselves in and, irrespective of the political hue of their government, whilst the provision of public transport remains dominated by free-market dogma, then many tough fights for our union lie ahead. Let's face it, a system that continues to prioritise the extraction of profits rather than their re-investment to improve customer transport services and industry safety means that our members continue to need – and deserve – a strong campaigning union. I am completely committed to continuing to deliver this over the next five years and to winning even wider support, for public ownership of all modes of public transport”.
Turnout in the ballot was 18.9 per cent. TSSA marks its 120th anniversary next year.
Justin Bieber – you know him, you have heard of him.

You probably love them or you probably hate him. Their music is good and their music is bad. They top the charts across the globe.  They are the 21st century's poster child for what social media and the internet can create with a young, burgeoning talent and a couple of million dollars.
Oh, he's also maybe (but probably not) a reptile. Bieber is touring Australia as part of their Purpose world tour. He's played in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth, and it's the Perth visit that has conspiracy folks frantically typing and shaking at the idea that maybe, just maybe, Justin Bieber let themselves slip up in front of hundreds of fans, revealing themselves to actually be a "giant reptile".
Much of the conspiracy hinges on an article ALLEGEDLY published (and then quickly taken down) on Perth Now, with a headline reading "Hundreds Of Fans Claim They Saw Justin Bieber Turn Into Giant Reptile". The alleged story went on to claim police had been called by distressed fans who saw "gross, coloured scales" all over Bieber's body. This site seemed to kick off the conspiracies, with the added bonus of more quotes about Lizard Bieber from the very reliable source of "local skater." "He was hanging around with this big guy, their bodyguard I guess, and we were just staring because they kept turning into a huge reptile,” said a local skater. “His bodyguard was pointing at us, shouting that he'd kick our teeth in if we didn't put our phones away.”
Yep. That totally happened.
Then there's this site , which claims Bieber is "a member of the dominant reptilian-Illuminati bloodline," (uh-duhhh) and that historians, who are not cited, say sightings of reptilians around the world have been reported at regular intervals throughout history.
There are also a few videos about the whole thing (but none of them have actual footage of Bieber transforming). This video has almost 250,000 views and features a robotic Siri-esque voice narrating the theory.
The whole "Justin Bieber is a lizard" thing has been around for a while.
In 2014 The Daily Dot published a story about Bieber's arrest that year, featuring a video of Bieber in court. It supposedly showed the pop superstar blinking like a lizard. That clip of Bieber now has over three million views.
On Twitter, there are a bajillion tweets all discussing the possibility of reptilian Bieber, too.
is justin bieber a reptile because all the video evidence has been taken down, which is exactly what would happen if they are, soooo..... ????
@justinbieber i heard youre a reptile, how did u go out with human like Gomez that long then? I love ur songs tho.
I'm watching conspiracy theory videos and apparently Justin Bieber is a shapeshifter reptile I am SHOOK
BuzzFeed News contacted the editors of Perth Now and asked if they published the story that potentially outed Bieber as a reptilian. Ben Martin, head of digital content, denied publishing it (but of course They WOULD) and said that after a search of their CMS there was no mention of Bieber's "cold-blooded antics". "I'm sad to say that we did not publish that piece," they said. Martin said Perth Now doesn't use upper case on the first letter of every word in its headlines ("that's for Ridiculous Conspiracy Theory Websites"); there was no full URL published "although our Illuminati Google Overlords could probably do a CTRL-X on that"; and the weather forecast for the day was wrong. So, the major player in this whole conspiracy is denying any involvement.
The 14 nations, aside from the United States, on the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council condemned President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital this week.
Trump's action was “not in line with Security Council resolutions and was unhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region,” according to a joint statement by the ambassadors of Britain, France, Sweden, Germany and Italy issued after the Friday council meeting.
However, the council as a body is unlikely to officially condemn the United States for the action, The New York Times reported. The U.S. is a permanent member and has veto power over the council.

Trump on Wednesday said the U.S. would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and announced plans to begin moving the U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv, a move that has been delayed by multiple presidents.
"This is a long-overdue step to advance the peace process and work toward a lasting agreement,” Trump said in their announcement. "This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It's also the right thing to do. It's something that has to be done.”
The international community does not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital because parts of the city are claimed by Palestinians for their possible future state. United States Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley Nimrata (Nikki) HaleyNikki Haley launches new policy group to tackle 'socialism,' other issues Trump selects Kelly Craft for United Nations ambassador Ivanka Trump endorses Nikki Haley's daughter for student vice president MORE said following Trump's speech that the U.S. is not weighing in on whether Jerusalem is indivisible, as Israel claims.
Eight of the 15 countries on the UN Security Council called for the emergency meeting following Trump's announcement, and multiple world leaders condemned Trump's decision, saying it threatened peace talks and a possible two-state solution in the Middle East.
The council member nations include China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, Bolivia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Senegal, Sweden, Ukraine and Uruguay.
Bolivia's ambassador, Sacha Sergio Llorenty Solíz, said the council needs to condemn the U.S. for Trump's decision, “otherwise the Security Council will become an occupied territory,” according to the Times report. The term "occupied" is one that is often used in discussions of areas with contested ownership in Israel.
Trump's move set off protests in the Middle East.
A reported 35 Palestinians were injured and two killed on Friday in clashes on the Gaza Strip's border with Israel following the announcement.
In Bethlehem, another contested city in the region, Israeli troops responded to Palestinians throwing stones with tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades, according to The Associated Press.
Israel also reportedly killed two members of Hamas in airstrikes on Saturday. The airstrikes were retaliation for a rocket attack from Gaza.
Saturday is the third Palestinian “day of rage” responding to Trump's decision and more protests are expected.

Even after hours of smooth flying, you shouldn't get very comfy. Why? Well, if you were to believe the world's foremost authority on airline safety, Professor Arnold Barnett of MIT, the riskiest segment of the flight, i.e., the landing, is still ahead of you.
The hundred-plus passengers and crew flying Shaheen Airlines learnt the hard lesson when their plane crash-landed at the Lahore airport.
After a mostly uneventful flight from Karachi, the plane came down with a big thud, forcing many to recite prayers.

It has not yet emerged on the national radar, but the dismal safety record of the Pakistani airlines is an open secret.
While private airlines operating out of Pakistan are too small to appear on international airline safety rankings, the national flag carrier, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), though makes several hit lists but all for the wrong reasons. It stands out as an outlier for poor safety record.
A comparative study of airline safety revealed that PIA has consistently underperformed on airline safety, and it is one of the world's most disaster-prone airlines.
Nate Silver is a famous American data scientist who wrote for the New York Times and manages fivethirtyeight.com, a blog that specialises in using data and analytics to offer informed commentary on political and socio-economic outcomes.
In July 2014, Mr. Silver addressed the question “Should travelers avoid flying airlines that have had crashes in the past?”
The simple answer is yes.
Mr. Silver relied on the Aviation Safety Network's database. They obtained the safety data from 1985 to 2014. And compared safety record over two periods, i.e., 1985 to 1999 and 2000 to 2014.
They wanted to see if the airlines that performed poorly earlier continued to do so later. The goal was to determine if some airlines were consistently better or worse than the rest for safety.
The airline safety data provided information on incidents (near misses), fatal incidents, and fatalities. Since airlines differ widely for fleet size and operations, they normalised the airline safety data by the available seat kilometers (ASK), which is calculated by multiplying the number of available seats by the kilometers flown by an airline.
Also read: Crash-landing — How was an aircraft with faulty landing gear allowed to fly?
This normalisation is needed to ensure that when we compare airlines, we are not essentially penalising airlines that fly significantly more than the rest. Conversely, we would not like to favour an airline with a limited fleet and less travel.
The other important distinction to acknowledge is that airlines' safety should not be based on a comparison of fatalities or fatal incidents. This is because even for the worst performing airlines, fortunately, fatal incidents are not an every-day occurrence.
The near misses are a better indicator of the airlines' safety culture.
Let me explain this with an example: You might know of a friend who is a high-risk driver. They speed, does not observe traffic regulations, and takes chances during driving. That individual will have several near misses.
However, the number of times a person could expire in a traffic accident, irrespective of how cautious or irresponsible one is in driving, remains 1. For this reason, it is better to compare near misses, because near misses identify a behavioural trait rather than an outcome.
Mr. Silver compared near misses for each airline over the two periods, 1985-1999 and 2000-2014. And guess which airline stood out to be consistently high risk prone over the two periods: Pakistan International Airlines.
“There are also a few major outliers in the chart: two are Pakistan International Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines, which have had a persistently high rate of incidents,” wrote Mr. Silver.

The government, especially the regulators at the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), has been negligently silent over the dismal safety records of Pakistan-based airlines.
It is time for a serious introspection on the state of airline safety in Pakistan.
In fact, one wonders why this matter is not yet an utmost priority for regulators, especially when this lax attitude towards air safety is not just restricted to the national airliner, but also permeates Pakistan's private carriers, the only other alternatives to flying for Pakistanis.
A Russian security researcher on Thursday said they have released attack code that exploits a critical vulnerability in the latest version of Mozilla's Firefox browser.
The exploit - which allows attackers to remotely execute malicious code on end user PCs - triggers a heap corruption vulnerability in the popular open-source browser, said Evgeny Legerov, founder of Moscow-based Intevydis. They recently added it as a module to Vulndisco, an add-on to the Immunity Canvas automated exploitation system sold to security professionals.
"We've played a lot with it in our labs - it was very reliable," Legerov wrote in an email to The Reg. "Works against the default install of Firefox 3.6. We've tested it on XP and Vista."
The report comes as Mozilla pushed out a Firefox update that tackles three critical vulnerabilities in version 3.5.7. One of those bugs is also described as a heap corruption vulnerability, but Legerov said the flaw is different from the one their code exploits.
Mozilla issued a statement that read in part: "Mozilla takes all security vulnerabilities seriously, and have as yet been unable to confirm the claim of an exploit. We value the contributions of all security researchers and encourage them to work within our security process, responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities to ensure the highest level of security and best outcome for users."
Legerov said their firm does not provide advanced notification to software makers under an arrangement often referred to as responsible disclosure.
If Legerov's claim pans out, it would be one of the few times in recent memory that a zero-day vulnerability for Firefox has circulated in the wild. While the exploit is currently available only to those who pay a hefty licensing fee, wider circulation can't be far behind. This story will be updated as more is learned.
More about the bug is here and here. ®
This story was updated to correct an inaccuracy about the availability of Immunity Canvas.
I'm going to entirely ignore the team update, because I find the concept of a gameplay contract between teams substantially more interesting. The possibility of a lawsuit between teams (because that's what you'd have to be willing to do to enforce the contract) isn't fantastic, but I feel confident enough that under the circumstances, the possibility is sufficiently remote as to treat this as a learning opportunity rather than as a plan for action.
I notice first of all that you appear to have used a contract template or contract generator. While that's a good idea—in that it provides you with a framework that covers the main tenets of a good contract—the one(s) you used seem to have led you a little astray. Or perhaps it's your cunning wit that led you astray, but either way, it's an interesting exercise to deconstruct the document.
The part starting with “[w]hereas” (called the recitals) don't have to be in flamboyant or arcane language, because that has no bearing on the legal strength of the document—so if you do include linguistic flourishes, do so because you think they sound nice, not because you think you need to. Legalese isn't necessary, it's just traditional—and frequently not for particularly good reasons. Also, claiming to be "a professional FRC team of good standing"1 is needlessly vain.
That statement of consideration, raises interesting and complicated questions. In British common law, consideration was a required element of most contracts,2 and meant that the parties had exchanged something valuable, and therefore that the contract was a meaningful endeavour. What you're essentially doing with that sentence, is telling the court that might eventually adjudicate a lawsuit over this contract, not to worry about looking for consideration: the parties stipulate that it exists. If that's what you want, it's a good hedge, if you're in a jurisdiction where consideration is a required element of a contract, and is strictly enforced—but firstly, the court is not compelled to accept that, and secondly, those jurisdictions are rarer and rarer these days. While in most commercial contracts, the consideration is self-evident and there's no need to belabour it, I think you're right to recite consideration here, because the benefits arising from the agreement are actually fairly intangible, and it won't harm you if consideration is immaterial in your jurisdiction.
Section 1 is too vague. You have to specify the circumstances. Cite the rules (as of a certain date, or the date of the agreement), and describe the actions in more detail.
Section 2 is not a good idea. The contract should explain the obligations of the parties to each other—but augmenting the scores is not a mutual obligation, and moreover, is not something which any party can accomplish without the support of the competition officials. Since the officials are not party to the contract, you should not try to predict what will happen in any particular circumstances.
The phrasing “would be considered” in section 3 is ambiguous, because it describes an uncertain future. (When, in the future does the breach occur?) Instead, specify the present tense to clarify that upon any of those actions, the breach exists.
There is also further ambiguity in section 3 due to definitions of “proper number”, or even “dispensing”. The second and third bullets would seem to be redundant to the fourth.
I hope you can provide a statutory citation to the law of gracious professionalism that covers termination of contracts. In practice, it may be difficult or impossible to escape certain principles of law that provide for the termination of contracts, even the text of the agreement prohibits it. For instance, you can't be precluded from terminating a contract when a court finds that continuing it would be contrary to public policy. Other contracts may not survive the death or dissolution of a party.
Specifying penalties in contract is a very bad idea: they're often held contrary to public policy, and invalidated automatically. Instead, specify that you're owed damages for the breach, where those damages reflect the harm you will suffer, rather than an arbitrary penalty. Actual damages require a calculation after the fact, and can be very complex to determine. Liquidated damages are required to be a “genuine pre-estimate of harm”, and can be specified in advance (in many jurisdictions) when the actual damages would be difficult to calculate.3
As a practical matter, identifying confidential information in writing may be difficult, especially if your communications are not entirely in writing. Also, the 3 exceptions you provide, while equitable, would make it very difficult for the aggrieved party to prevail in the event of a breach of confidentiality. They would have to prove the state of the other (probably unco-operative) party's knowledge—even with a preponderance of the evidence standard, that's not easy.
By the way, the public domain frequently refers to a copyright concept: things which are not copyrightable (or arguably,4 released from copyright by their owners) are in the public domain. Uncreative speech composed of mere facts is not copyrightable, so you might want to reconsider the public domain exception here.
As we're talking copyright, skip ahead to section 8. Creative works are copyrightable, and a contract might well be a creative work (because the threshold of creativity is very low), but if you used a template, some of the template's copyright may persist in your work. (That's by no means unusual, but bears consideration, because you can't unilaterally assign or abrogate others' intellectual property rights unless under licence to do so.) And by the way, I'd (very likely5) be free to reproduce your copyrighted work under the fair use doctrine, in conjunction with this post which constitutes criticism and comment.
Jumping back to section 7, an indemnity clause isn't a bad idea (if you can get anyone to agree to it—because I certainly wouldn't indemnify you for free). But unfortunately, yours only extends to intellectual property claims, and is thus pretty much useless here.
The independent contractor clause in section 9 is very often grossly misused in employment contracts. But here, it is appropriate.
The general provisions of section 10 are a good idea, but they do come with some complications. You should be cautious when you specify that portions of a contract survive invalidation of other portions, because you can sometimes be left with an agreement that is suddenly rather disadvantageous to you after all the tasty bits have been thrown out by a court. A more complex, but sometimes better solution is to specify exactly which portions survive when which other portions are invalidated.
The choice of law provisions will only apply if a court decides that there is a rational connection to the specified jurisdiction (Texas). If the parties were all from California, and the agreement was performed in California, the choice of law provision would probably be invalidated by a California court.
Non-waiver is a pretty reasonable thing to require. Service of process by certified mail is convenient as a default option; other options for service can be cheaper or more expeditious, but this is a safe bet and preserves an independent paper trail.
As for the signatures, only a signatory with authority to commit the party to the agreement can sign. In many cases, minors cannot sign contracts without a parent/guardian, or the contracts they can sign are limited in scope. Only a designated representative of an organization can sign for it, and if no such person is designated, or the scope of the organization is unclear (team? school? sponsor? family?), this can get complicated. Of course, if the signatory is invalid, the organization is not a party to the agreement—even if you thought at the time that they were. (You may have equitable remedies available to you if they were misrepresented as a valid signatory, but again, who has time for more lawsuits.)
And as for the dates, be careful when you list a bunch of dates like that, and then have a separate date for the date of the agreement. In this case, it's probably not a huge deal, but it can lead to questions of the date on which the agreement was intended to enter into force. If the signatures are dated after the date of the agreement, is that evidence that the agreement is intended to apply retroactively? If the signatures are undated, does the date of the agreement govern? Best to specify that the agreement enters force immediately when a sufficient number of parties have signed and dated it.6 And since you're dealing with same-day performance of the contract, it makes sense to also specify the time, for each signature.
Nice work applying legal principles to our favourite robotic challenge. With the reduction in major ambiguities in the rules this year,7 this is a good way to practice those skills. If you ever feel the desire to read up on contracts, I'd recommend leafing through Ken Adams' blog and articles (and if you're serious about contracts, their book too). I find their approach to contract construction refreshingly modern and compatible with engineering sensibilities. Many of my comments here follow in some measure from reasoning that he's presented.
1 In a good contract, you should define your abbreviations, like “FRC”—even though it is unlikely to impair the contract in this context.
2 Contracts under seal are an exception, for no good reason—at least no reason that is particularly valid in modern times.
3 Jurisdictions differ on when liquidated damages are a bar to recovering actual damages instead—in some cases, the fact that you liquidate your damages means that you cannot claim actual damages when that would be more advantageous. You definitely can't claim both at once. There are other options like specific performance (you must do the thing you said you were going to do, but that only works if it's within the breaching party's ability to do so) or alternative performance (specify several alternatives; although some are less good, the parties stipulate that none are breaches, and each will be compensated appropriately).
4 In a very limited, technical way.
5 You would literally have to sue me to find out. That's not even a threat, it's the way the law is—fair use can only be definitively established by a court; everybody else takes their chances.
6 And if they sign and fail to date it, it should take effect when the signature is delivered to you.
7 Namely the glorious lack of bumper rules.
Miami Heat captain Udonis Haslem has some advice – and a message – for their good friend, Dwyane Wade.
“My advice to them is, ‘Hey, we'd love to have you but take it one step at a time, take it one day at a time,” Haslem said today on the Joe Rose Show on 560WQAM. “The situation with Chicago and everything that's going on it's just a frustrating situation on both sides and I think they just made a decision based on frustration.”
Haslem, who is about to start their 15th season with the Heat, spent 13 of those with Wade. With speculation Wade and the Chicago Bulls are headed for a breakup via a buyout, Haslem is hoping to be reunited with their friend.
“We kind of understand the direction Chicago is going in,” Haslem said. “We kind of understand the direction that Dwyane wants to go in the last couple of years of their career. The business side of things sometimes doesn't always allow both sides to co-exist.”
Wade, 35, bolted Miami a year ago to sign with their hometown team but the homecoming was rocky with Wade clashing with teammates, having their differences with coach Fred Hoiberg and the Bulls being eliminated in the first round of the playoffs after winning the tiebreaker against the Heat to earn the final seed in Eastern Conference.
Still, it was not bad enough for Wade to leave $23.8 million on the table, picking up the final year of that contract. But ever since they decided to return, talk of a buyout started.
And those conversations typically start with the Heat.
If the sides are able to agree to a price, Wade could sign with any team for the pro-rated minimum or possibly an exception, which the Heat still carry.
Haslem, who has won three titles with the Heat, was asked about a variety of other topics:
On their career: “I can't imagine things playing out any better for me. I would do it out all over again and I would do it exactly the same way. I would go undrafted. I would go to Europe. All that was a part of my journey I had to take to get to this situation. It's been an amazing journey, frustrating at times but I had to understand what my purpose was.”
On this Miami Heat team: “This is the most like-me group of guys I've had an opportunity to be around. Guys that felt like they've been disrespected, they've been overlooked, they have something to prove.”
On visiting Miami Dolphins camp Wednesday: “I was a big deal for me. I never thought 15, 20 years ago when I was sitting across the street watching games on the big screen and listening to the crowd when it was called Joe Robbie Stadium, I never thought I would have the opportunity to talk to those guys, encourage those guys, give those guys some words of wisdom. It's just a dream come true.”
On the what they told the team: “Three things that it boiled down to for us. We all enjoyed each others success. We genuinely got to the point we are able to sacrifice, strip down, enjoy each others success. The second thing being a good teammate. The third thing getting to know your guys, getting to know their families, getting to know everything about them and maximizing your role.”
Honored to have spent the morning with the @MiamiDolphins. Thank you to Coach Gase and the entire Dolphins crew! #FinsUp pic.twitter.com/OKNbjGAaNq — Udonis Haslem (@ThisIsUD) August 16, 2017

Iowa running back Jordan Canzeri has suffered a torn ACL and likely will miss the 2012 season, according to multiple reports.
Canzeri's father, Brian, told Scout.com that the sophomore-to-be suffered the knee injury in practice Wednesday, and an MRI performed Thursday revealed the tear.
Brian Canzeri told the Web site that Jordan will undergo surgery next week and hopes to return to practice by September but likely will redshirt the 2012 season.
The (Cedar Rapids) Gazette reports Canzeri has no other structural damage in their knee but will miss the upcoming season.
The team has yet to confirm Canzeri's injury.
Canzeri's injury is the latest setback to a position group that has been in flux since former Doak Walker Award winner Shonn Greene departed following the 2008 season. Marcus Coker, who led Iowa and finished second in the Big Ten with 1,384 rushing yards last fall, left the team in January following a suspension and eventually transferred to FCS Stony Brook. Mika'il McCall, the team's No. 2 running back, also transferred.
Canzeri started in place of the suspended Coker at the Insight Bowl in December. They logged 31 carries for 114 yards as a true first-year student in 2011.
Sophomores Damon Bullock and De'Andre Johnson will receive most of the work at running back for the rest of the spring. Heralded incoming first-year student Greg Garmon enters the mix this summer.
I've been having some interesting discussions with some management peers of mine, and from job seekers.
THE PROBLEM
Those of us who have had our stay in the information security management chair realize that we have to periodically interview and hire new staff as positions get budgeted or staff members retire or leave.
Very few of us enjoy this process, and for a reason that seems completely obvious to me but is apparently lost on the industry as a whole: we have no idea what we're doing.
CASE STUDY
Let's walk through a sample hiring scenario and examine the "fail".
ABC Security is expanding its information security staff dramatically in 2011. The director of information security determines that they have to split their team into two sub-teams, each lead by a manager. Them single existing manager will manage team alpha, which primarily deals with governance and compliance. They will need to hire another manager to lead team bravo, which is responsible for risk, assessments, response, and mitigation. The director works with HR to create a job description and a job order. HR gets to work soliciting resumes from their professional contacts, job sites, and referrals. They sift through the submissions and decide on 5 candidates. The interviewing process consists of: 1) Telephone pre-screen by HR 2) Telephone pre-screen by hiring manager (the director) and reduce the candidates from 5 to 3 3) In-person interview with director and various other staff members 4) In-person interview with HR to answer questions about the company HR has already pre-screened the 5 candidates, and sets up phone interviews with the director. Nobody has ever trained the director on how to conduct an interview, or educated them on Federal and local laws pertaining to the hiring process  They are on their own! They quickly write a script to follow with all 5 candidates, with a list of questions that they think will give them a good idea of who they should bring in for in-person interviews. Them list of questions contains gems like: What are your strengths? What are your weaknesses? Why did you leave your former employer? What did you do at your former employer? Are you familiar with (acronym that is never defined)? Have you managed people? Can you be responsible for a budget? After asking all 5 candidates these questions, they select 3, and then asks the same questions to those 3 in person.
 They are confused that they really doesn't have a better feel for any of the candidates after the process is completed. What did they do wrong? Who do they hire? They have no idea.
The real "problem" here is one that not only plagues information security managers, but information technology managers in general. They haven't properly engaged the candidates.
Let's look at the questions on the director's list - every single one of those questions can be answered by reading the candidates' resumes. Why waste their time rehashing the same information?
A BETTER WAY
Information technology (and especially information security) is a discipline that requires an interviewer to get inside a candidate's head. But how does one do that?
Figure out how they think.
The absolute best way to properly evaluate a candidate is to present them with a real-world (or largely hypothetical) situation or problem, and ask them to walk through the process of solving it. This can be through a conversation, or bring out the trusty whiteboard with markers. Most folks in IT are thought mappers - they need to properly diagram and pseudocode their processes and problem-solving procedures.
A BETTER EXAMPLE
Let's look at the scenario above again, but educate the director on how to properly syphon relevant and useful information out of their candidates' heads.
Director: This position will be managing a team of 5 information security analysts, engineers and testers. Assume the role of the manager. You receive a call from the network operations team that all three of the company's web servers are under a denial of service attack. Describe for me what your next steps are.
or Director: This position will be managing a team of 5 information security analysts, engineers and testers. Assume the role of the manager. You receive a call from the network operations team that all three of the company's web servers are under a denial of service attack. Use the whiteboard next to you to diagram what next steps might be in a situation like that.
Assuming that a typical interview is one to two hours, the director can present a number of these scenarios and get an excellent understanding of the candidates' thought processes.
WORKS FOR SOFT SKILLS TOO
This same process can be used for non-technical situations.
How does the candidate deal with management that don't understand the value of security in an organization? Conflict between team members? An unhappy client?
WHAT REALLY DOESN'T WORK
I have to list my personal top 10 list of huge NO-NOs when interviewing candidates:
Myers-Briggs and intelligence tests. Seriously, these are worthless. They are so well known that with a few quick searches on the Internet, candidates can gauge what their responses should be to appear likable to the hiring manager. If you're hiring a penetration tester, do they really need to understand advanced geometric problem-solving techniques? Don't draw the process out. If your interview process from beginning to end exceeds 10 hours, you are doing something terribly wrong, and putting an undue burden on the candidate - especially if they are unemployed and tight on cash. Don't beat them repeatedly with the same hose. If you have 10 people interview a candidate, at least give them different questions to ask. If the candidate has to answer the same questions over and over, it becomes a robotic process and you're not getting anything useful out of the candidate past the first round of questioning. Don't require the candidate to know all the names of your management team and board of directors, unless they are going to meet every one. Expecting a fair amount of research about your company is fine - expecting them to memorize your company charter is not. Avoid asking all negative questions. "What didn't you like about your last boss? The company? Your staff?" Encourage them to talk about their successes, and how they can leverage those to make you a success. Don't appear as filler to the candidate. If you're a VP and interviewing a potential new staff member, don't start the interview by saying "I have no idea what this position is, or what you'd be doing." Brief your interviewers! Don't create an interview process that is so long and drawn out that you spend most of the time picking apart a candidate instead of realizing their potential. This is especially true for candidates at the manager level and above. Don't spend half of your interview hour talking about yourself and your accomplishments. You're burning their time, and boring them to tears. Don't starve them. If your interview times fall on breakfast, lunch, or dinner times - feed them. Be courteous, and treat them like guests. If you don't speak the candidate's native language, put someone on the phone that does. Nothing is more frustrating than having to ask an interviewer to repeat questions 3 or 4 times. (Bonus) - If you are going to use a generic term in a question like "whitelisting" or "storage", make sure the question is framed properly - otherwise, you don't get the answer you want and the candidate waste valuable interview time.
I'd love everyone's feedback on how this method can be expanded and improved upon. Share some situations that went well, and those that didn't.

Sorry I haven't been posting much this month. There's actually a great reason for this – I'm hosting a murder mystery show this whole month and into the first weekend of November. This has left me with very little free time but it's been a lot of fun. I've also been making treats every Saturday for the show.
A couple weeks ago I made my famous chocolate chip cookies, but last week I decided to try something different. I whipped up these vegan pumpkin bars and they were a smash hit. And now, you lucky ducks, I'm going to share the secret with you! Make these for your Halloween or fall festivities and watch them disappear.
Ingredients
1 ⅔ cup vegan sugar
1 cup applesauce
1 cup coconut or canola oil
1 can pumpkin or butternut squash
2 cups flour
1 tsp salt
2 tsp baking powder
2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and grease either a 15” x 10” jelly roll pan (which I don't have) or you can improvise with a 9” x 13” pan and another smaller rectangular pan (which I had to do). Pans can be glass or metal. Combine the sugar, applesauce, oil, and canned gourd of choice in a large bowl using a hand mixer until well incorporated. In a separate, medium bowl, stir together the flour, salt, baking powder, and pumpkin pie spice.
Using the hand mixer, pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredient bowl and gradually mix together until completely added and smooth. Spoon batter into the pan(s) about ½ inch high and put into the oven for about 30 minutes, or until it comes up clean. If it comes up a little dirty it's actually okay, but get the toothpick as clean as you can without overcooking. You want these to be moist.
Let the bars cool to room temp or put in the fridge to speed up the process. While they're cooling, make the frosting.
Ingredients
¼ cup Earth Balance buttery sticks
¾ – 1 container of vegan cream cheese (use Tofutti. Do it.)
1 ½ cups vegan powdered sugar
1 tsp vanilla
2 – 3 tbsp coconut or almond milk
Directions
Put Earth Balance, ¾ container of cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla in a bowl and mix with a hand mixer. Blend until smooth and add coconut milk and cream cheese until you reach the desired consistency and flavor. Put in the fridge for at least 30 mins and don't put on the bars until they're at least room temp. Spread on just like frosting and then put the whole shebang in the fridge until ready to serve.
Serves…a lot. I don't even know because it didn't last long enough for me to count.
Ubisoft Montpellier is hard at work on a prototype for a ZombiU sequel, creative director Jean-Philippe Caro has told fans on Twitter.
Asked if we can expect a sequel, Caro replied: "Thank you for your interest in ZombiU. The team is working hard on a prototype."
However, they added "it's too soon to tell you more".
This isn't the first time the studio has spoken of a sequel. Earlier this year producer Guillaume Brunier hinted at cooperative play in a future game.
"How to bring a cooperative experience and still keep fear and tension is a question we would love to address," said Brunier.
"In our most exciting dreams, we would like to create an online experience where players never quite know where they stand between coop and player vs. player.
"Doubt is a great nest for tension and fear."
But given Wii U's struggle to penetrate the market and Ubisoft's prior decision to delay Rayman Origins to ensure a multi-format release, could a ZombiU sequel also see a release on other consoles?

New Orleans Saints General Manager Mickey Loomis signed a five-year contract extension in August, Saints spokesperson Greg Bensel said Monday night. Loomis also said Monday night they signed an extension "months ago." So Loomis' contract extension occurred long before Coach Sean Payton was given a five-year contract extension in late December.
New Orleans Saints general manager Mickey Loomis reportedly has received a five-year contract extension.
Loomis has been the Saints' general manager since 2002 and it appears Loomis is now under contract through the 2017 season. Loomis served an eight-game suspension in 2012 in connection to the bounty scandal, but owner Tom Benson never wavered in their support for Loomis.
Loomis also serves as the executive vice president for the New Orleans Hornets.
"To have that kind of stability for the long term, that's reassuring because that's always the kind of thing people like to talk about," Saints owner/vice chairperson of the board Rita Benson LeBlanc told USA Today on Monday afternoon. "Plus, football is a stressful enough business as it is. It's hard enough to put a competitive team on the field. (Payton and Loomis) shouldn't have those extra stresses of having to worry about their future and the future of the franchise."
