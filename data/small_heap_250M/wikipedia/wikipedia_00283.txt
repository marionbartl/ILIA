The Glauchau-Meerane Reichstag constituency was constituency No. 17 in the Kingdom of Saxony which returned a deputy to the German Reichstag. It included Glauchau, Meerane and Hohenstein-Ernstthal located in Chemnitzer Land.
Following the North German Confederation Treaty, the Kingdom of Saxony entered the North German Confederation in 1866. As a consequence, the Kingdom returned Deputies to the Reichstag of the North German Confederation. After the founding of the German Empire on 18 January 1871, the deputies were returned to the Reichstag of the German Empire. Following this, Saxony participated in Reichstag elections from February 1867. Glauchau-Meerane returned a series of Reichstag Deputies until 1919 when the existing constituencies were scrapped.
The deputies elected for the Glauchau-Meerane Reichstag constituency were as follows:

Ralph T. Adimari (1902–1970) was an editor, researcher, and historian of the dime novel.
Life
A prodigious collector, Adimari did extensive research on dime novels, and published many articles in Dime Novel Round-Up before 1940, and at least 20 articles between 1954 and 1964. He also wrote a piece titled "Saga of a Dime Novelist" which appeared in American Book Collector in early 1935. Through correspondence with fellow dime novel historian and Dime Novel Round-Up editor Ralph F. Cummings, Adimari acquired the letters and notebooks of William J. Benners (1863-1940), a dime novel historian, author, and agent, and wrote a biography of Benners for the DNRU. Building upon Benners's work identifying dime novel authors, Adimari compiled detailed lists of authors and pseudonyms, titles, and publishers, definitively solving several mysteries about dime novel authorship.
Adimari was born Raphael Adimare on October 19, 1902. He lived in the New York City area for most of his life, including Mount Vernon and Suffolk. In addition to his work on dime novels, he co-edited a 1936 collection of Walt Whitman's essays, titled New York Dissected. Adimari died November 1970 in Suffolk, New York.
The Ralph Adimari Papers are housed in the Fales Library and Special Collections at New York University's Bobst Library. The papers comprise correspondence from fellow dime novel collectors and historians, including Edward G. Levy, Dr. Albert Johannsen, Dime Novel Round-Up editors Edward T. LeBlanc and Ralph Cummings, the latter from whom Adimari acquired William Benners's papers, and writers including Col. Charles D. Randolph, aka "Buckskin Bill," known for his dime-novel and Western themed poetry. Also included are notebooks of research, manuscripts, newspaper clippings related to dime novel authors, photographs, and Victoriana. The William J. Benners Papers, also housed in Fales, includes several of Benners's notebooks that were subsequently used and annotated by Adimari.

Joseph Thomas Wilson (September 25, 1891) was an American journalist, politician, and author. He served in several regiments, including the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, during the American Civil War. After the war's end, he was the publisher of several Reconstruction-era publications and a radical member of the Republican Party, active on a state level. Wilson was also a successful author; his 1888 The Black Phalanx sold well and has been described as the "most comprehensive study of African American military service" of the era.
Biography
Joseph T. Wilson was born in 1836 or January 1837 in Norfolk, Virginia. He may have been enslaved at birth; his mother, Louisa Wilson, was likely free and his father, Bristow, enslaved. He was later described as "mulatto". He left Norfolk after turning in a fugitive put his safety in danger and attended schools in New Bedford, Massachusetts.
According to his writings, Wilson was out of the nation on a whaling ship for what was to be three years. He learnt of the outbreak of the American Civil War when the ship docked in Valparaíso, Chile, in 1862, and quickly returned to the US. He spent three days serving in a regiment from New York in the war. He was forced to leave the regiment after they realized he was Black. So Wilson instead traveled to New Orleans, where his father had been sold, and enlisted in the 2nd Louisiana Native Guard Infantry Regiment, on September 30, 1862. As part of the regiment he fought in the Siege of Port Hudson. Wilson suffered from chronic diarrhea, at one point hospitalized and was eventually honorably discharged. After moving back to Massachusetts, Wilson enlisted in the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, Company C. He was discharged on May 8, 1864, after having been injured in the Battle of Olustee in February 1864. In September 1864 he was involved in the attempted capture of Fort Fisher as a boat pilot. For a time after this Wilson was a member of the Army of the James' secret service.
Though Wilson was permanently disabled after his injury in the Battle of Olustee, his attempts to receive a pension, which began as early as November 1864 and continued for the next 25 years were unsuccessful into the 1880s. He married Elizabeth Hattie Smith on March 19, 1868; the couple had three children but none survived past childhood.
In early 1865 he moved back to Norfolk and initially found work in a supply store before taking editorship of The True Southerner. He was in a group that formed the Colored Monitor Union Club on April 4, 1865, a group advocating for suffrage that voted in the elections on May 25. Their votes were not counted. He was elected to serve on a committee of eight that drafted the "Address from the Colored Citizens of Norfolk, Virginia, to the People of the United States" in June 1865. The address advocated for equality of Black people with white and particularly in favor of equal suffrage. It warned that former slaveowners would deprive freed slaves of their rights, which they were willing to work hard to secure. It also proposed land associations to allow African-Americans to purchase land.
Wilson was still The True Southerner editor when a white mob destroyed its press in 1866. He then left the region to settle in Petersburg, Virginia. There, he founded and published the short-lived paper The Union Republican in 1867. In the 1870s he returned to Norfolk and worked for a time for the Internal Revenue Service, gauging and inspecting customs, and at one point was colonel aide-de-camp to the commander of the Grand Army of the Republic. Returning to Petersburg, Wilson published The American Sentinel and The Right Way in the 1880s.
Wilson was politically active as a member of the Republican Party. After the 1867 Reconstruction Acts were enacted, he participated in many party events, with what Elizabeth Varon describes as a "radical voice", being elected to the Norfolk City Council in 1870 and unsuccessfully running for Congress six years later. He campaigned for Ulysses S. Grant in the 1872 election and cast a vote for Rutherford B. Hayes four years later as a presidential elector. His house was attacked in 1871 for his activism. Wilson continued to advocate vocally for the rights of Black people, speaking and publishing widely. He criticized the Readjuster Party.
History work
Following the end of the Civil War, Wilson embarked on research into Black history. He published Emancipation: Its Course and Progress in 1882, charting Black history from 1481 BC, which he identified as the year of an exodus, to 1875 AD. The historian Earl E. Thorpe, in an analysis of Wilson's work, described the book as "a very crude effort" and noted the difficulty of covering 3000 years of history in 242 pages. Also in 1882 Wilson was delegated with the task of writing a history of the regiment he served with by the Grand Army of the Republic. The work that emerged from this was The Black Phalanx, published in 1888 and covering the history of Black soldiers in the American Revolutionary War, War of 1812, and American Civil War. Nineteen chapters and 528 pages long, the book also has biographical sketches of prominent figures. Just two of those chapters cover the American Revolution and War of 1812; the remaining seventeen focused on the Civil War. This book had three total editions published. The American Publishing Company sought to make the book a success, with a door-to-door campaign, subscription sales, agent selling, and widely advertising. Their efforts were successful; the educator Irvine Garland Penn wrote three years later that sales "surpass[ed] that of any other work written by an Afro-American."
Thorpe thought Wilson's coverage of the first two wars had "nothing new", but the later ones used credible sources but suffered from excessive quotation (around half of the book) and numerous grammatical mistakes. It also lacked an index. The public positively received it, and the work was lauded as his magnum opus upon his death. Nine years later the book was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. Historians Arthur Schomburg and John Edward Bruce deemed it a foundational text in its field in 1911. Carter G. Woodson wrote in 1944 that it had "shaped" his "historical consciousness" according to Varon.
Later life and death
Wilson died on September 25, 1891. Despite its early success and influence, Varon wrote in 2019 that The Black Phalanx had received little critical attention in the modern era; Wilson himself has often been "overshadowed" by George Washington Williams. According to the scholar Donald Yacovone, the book was the "most comprehensive study of African American military service" for at least a generation after its publication.

Frederick Hotham Andrus (August 23, 1850 – November 10, 1937) was an outfielder and pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Chicago White Stockings. In 1876 he played 8 games in the outfield, batting .306 in 36 at bats. In 1884, he played one game, pitching a complete game win on July 4 against the Philadelphia Quakers, allowing two earned runs.
He previously played for a club in Jackson, Michigan, called the Mutuals in 1875, while working for a newspaper. After playing for the White Stocking in 1876, he played for a Milwaukee team in 1877, and stayed there to work as a clerk in a book store. He moved to Chicago in 1884 to be the treasurer for Albert Spalding's sporting goods company, a position he held for eight years. He joined David Whitney Jr.'s real estate company in Detroit, later managing his estate until his death of pneumonia at the age of 87. He was initially interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in Detroit, but was later re-interred at Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago.

Intel Fortran Compiler, is a group of Fortran compilers from Intel for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Overview
The compilers generate code for IA-32 and Intel 64 processors and certain non-Intel but compatible processors, such as certain AMD processors. A specific release of the compiler (11.1) remains available for development of Linux-based applications for IA-64 (Itanium 2) processors. On Windows, it is known as Intel Visual Fortran. On macOS and Linux, it is known as Intel Fortran. In 2020 the existing compiler was renamed “Intel Fortran Compiler Classic” (ifort) and a new Intel Fortran Compiler for oneAPI (ifx) supporting GPU offload was introduced.
The 2021 release of the Classic compiler adds full Fortran support through the 2018 standard, full OpenMP* 4.5, and Initial Open MP 5.1 for CPU only. The 2021 beta compiler focuses on OpenMP for GPU Offload. When used with the Intel HPC toolkit (see the "Description of Packaging" below) the compiler can also automatically generate Message Passing Interface calls for distributed memory multiprocessing from OpenMP directives.
For more information on Fortran standards, a number or resources are available, such as the Wikipedia Fortran entry or the Fortran wiki page.
Optimizations
Intel compilers are optimized for computer systems using processors that support Intel architectures. They are designed to minimize stalls and to produce code that executes in the fewest possible number of cycles. Intel Fortran Compilers support three separate high-level techniques for optimizing the compiled program: interprocedural optimization (IPO), profile-guided optimization (PGO), and other high-level optimizations (HLO).
Interprocedural optimization applies typical compiler optimizations (such as constant propagation) but uses a broader scope that may include multiple procedures, multiple files, or the entire program.
Regarding profile-guided optimization, the compiler generates a dataset of performance-related information from using the application with representative workloads, which it then analyzes to find which parts of the application are executed more and less frequently. The compiler uses these data to organize application execution to optimize performance based on how the application is actually used. This is in contrast to IPO which optimizes applications according to the logical flow of the application independent of workloads. The two can be combined to provide workload-based optimizations within which the logical-flow is optimized. Thus, all optimizations can benefit from profile-guided feedback because they are less reliant on heuristics when making compilation decisions.
High-level optimizations are optimizations performed on a version of the program that more closely represents the source code. This includes loop interchange, loop fusion, loop unrolling, loop distribution, data prefetch, and more.
Standards support
The Intel Fortran Compiler Classic fully supports Fortran through the 2018 standard. The Intel Fortran Compiler (Beta) supports full Fortran 77/90/95 and has partial support of the Fortran 2003 standard.
Architectures

Description of packaging
The compilers are available standalone from Intel and from APT and Yum repositories. They are also available in the Intel oneAPI HPC Toolkit which includes other build tools, such as libraries, and analysis tools for error checking and performance analysis. Containers with the compilers are on Docker Hub.
History since 2003
Debugging
The Intel compiler provides debugging information that is standard for the common debuggers (DWARF 2 on Linux, similar to gdb, and COFF for Windows). The flags to compile with debugging information are on Windows and on Linux. Debugging is done on Windows using the Visual Studio debugger, and on Linux using gdb.
While the Intel compiler can generate a gprof-compatible profiling output, Intel also provides a kernel-level, system-wide statistical profiler as a separate product called VTune. VTune features an easy-to-use GUI (integrated into Visual Studio for Windows, Eclipse for Linux) as well as a command-line interface. In addition to the VTune profiler, there is Intel Advisor that specializes in vectorization optimization and tools for threading design and prototyping.
Intel also offers a tool for memory and threading error detection called Intel Inspector XE. Regarding memory errors, it helps detect memory leaks, memory corruption, allocation/de-allocation of API mismatches and inconsistent memory API usage. Regarding threading errors, it helps detect data races (both heap and stack), deadlocks and thread and synch API errors.

The Penal Code of California forms the basis for the application of most criminal law, criminal procedure, penal institutions, and the execution of sentences, among other things, in the American state of California. It was originally enacted in 1872 as one of the original four California Codes, and has been substantially amended and revised since then. The entirety of the Penal Code is available for free at leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codesTOCSelected.xhtml?tocCode=PEN
History
The Penal Code enacted by the California State Legislature in February 1872 was derived from a penal code proposed by the New York code commission in 1865 which is frequently called the Field Penal Code after the most prominent of the code commissioners, David Dudley Field II (who did draft the commission's other proposed codes). The actual drafter of the New York penal code was commissioner William Curtis Noyes, a former prosecutor. New York belatedly enacted the Field Penal Code in 1881.
Prior to the promulgation of the Model Penal Code in 1962, the Field Penal Code was by far the most broadly influential attempt at codification of criminal law, but was severely flawed in that it actually continued many muddled common law concepts (like malice aforethought) when the point of codification was to clean up the common law. About this, UC Berkeley law professor Sanford H. Kadish wrote in 1987: "None of the codes I have considered had a larger measure of influence. None deserved it less." Before the enactment of the Penal Code, California relied on common law definitions of crimes as well as the accumulated case law that went back to the British common law of post-colonial times.
Organization
Like most of California's codes, the Penal Code is divided into parts, with the Penal Code containing six, most of which contain titles, some of which are in turn subdivided into chapters, with individual sections comprising the smallest unit of content. Unlike sections of the United States Code, any particular provision of the Penal Code is usually referenced by its section number alone, especially when a police officer in the state refers to a particular criminal act over their radio. Most of this article deals exclusively with the substantive criminal law set out in Part 1.
The first two titles of Part 1, up to Section 33, are preliminary and provide definitions of legal terms rather than definitions of, or punishments for, any specific crimes. The next group of titles, through Section 88, deal with crimes against the state itself, such as treason. Title 7, ending with Section 186, covers the state court system and crimes that can be committed therein, such as perjury. Title 8 covers the subject of violent crimes, and extends through Section 249. Title 9 (Sections 250 through 368) deals with offenses against public morals and decency. Title 10 (Sections 369 through 402) is devoted to "crimes against public health and safety," while Title 11 (Sections 403–423) is reserved for "crimes against the public peace." The topic of Title 12 (Sections 424–440) is crimes against public revenue, and of Title 13 (Sections 441 through 593), crimes against property. Title 14 (Sections 594–625) bears the heading "Malicious Mischief," but in addition to vandalism (Section 594), it also includes such offenses as trespassing (in Section 602). Title 15 (Sections 625–653) deals with "Miscellaneous Crimes," Title 16 (Sections 654-678) is labeled "General Provisions," and the last title of Part 1, Title 17 (679 and 680) delineates the "Rights of Victims and Witnesses of Crime."
Part 2 of the Penal Code (Sections 681–1020) codifies the state's criminal procedure system.
Part 3 of the Penal Code (Sections 2000–10007) codifies statutes governing the state's corrections system. Part 3 includes provisions governing the operation of the county jails and state prisons, as well as the administration of the death penalty.
Part 4 of the Penal Code (Sections 11006–14315) codifies statutes governing criminal investigations, prison officer training, police officer training, crime control, crime prevention, and gun control.
Part 5 of the Penal Code (Sections 15001–15003) consists of only two sections authorizing the California Peace Officers Memorial Foundation to establish and maintain a memorial to peace officers on the grounds of the state Capitol with private funds.
Part 6 of the Penal Code (Sections 16000–34370) codifies statutes dealing with the management of weapons.
California's drug laws are not found within the Penal Code at all, but in a separate enactment, the California Health and Safety Code. Likewise, provisions affecting motorists, motor vehicles, and traffic matters are contained in the California Vehicle Code.

"420" for marijuana use is commonly but incorrectly believed to originate from the Penal Code. The actual Section 420 covers obstructing entry on public land.
One of the more controversial sections of the California Penal Code are the consecutive Sections 666 and 667; Section 666, known officially as petty theft with a prior'and colloquially, felony petty theft and makes it possible for someone who committed a minor shoplifting crime to be charged with a felony if the person had been convicted of any theft-related offense at any time in the past; and if the person so charged has two previous felony convictions (listed as serious or violent felonies ["strikeable" offenses]), this can result in a 25-years-to-life sentence under the state's three strikes law, which is found in Section 667.
The inclusion of felony petty theft within the three-strikes law, and for that matter, the three-strikes law itself, have sparked much debate both within and outside the state, and even beyond the United States. In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the California three-strikes law against constitutional challenges in two cases where the third strike was a nonviolent crimeEwing v. California, , and Lockyer v. Andrade'', .

The sixth season of Bad Girls Club is titled Bad Girls Club: Hollywood and premiered on January 10, 2011, on Oxygen. Season 6 was nominated for "Favorite Reality-Show Guilty Pleasure" for the second annual IVillageawards.
Production
Unlike previous seasons where a half-a-year break in production occurred between seasons, the sixth installment was shot several months after Bad Girls Club: Miami was completed. Casting for the sixth season was done simultaneously after production of Bad Girls Club: Miami was completed. Season six debuted with 1.71 million viewers, up from 25% from last season which earned 1.34 million viewers. One-on-one interviews, with Bunim/Murray Productions, were an option from eligible applicants, who needed to include their email, full name, phone number, and a brief biography telling the casting productions what makes them a "bad girl". Applicants were also told to include two recent photos of themselves before submissions, or otherwise the application wouldn't be accepted. The minimum age to apply was 21. Bunim/Murray Productions were also recruiting on Facebook and MySpace, along with a five-minute casting tape to Bunim-Murray Productions. Production of season six began in October 2010 in Sherman Oaks, California. The tour of season six's mansion was released for public viewing on December 15, 2010, while Oxygen changed their website's homepage for the upcoming season of the Bad Girls Club. The tour of the house was hosted by Steve Leonhardt, the Bad Girls Club production designer, and several days prior to the arrival of the cast of season six, in September 2010.
Controversy
During production of season six, residents from Sherman Oaks complained that noise levels and swearing was extremely unbearable and inappropriate for them and their children to listen to during the night. Residents from Ocean Beach called local enforcements four to five times to defuse the corruptions, the girls were showcasing, in the middle of the night. A local Ocean Beach resident complained that she has a six-year-old son and didn't want him to listen to the swearing, she went as far as creating a petition drive to ban all production companies in the Ocean Beach hills. Location managers and production crew declined to discuss the neighbors complaints. The Bad Girls Club permit announced that the entire production was to abide the "minimum outdoor activity noise" rule, whereas, neighbors state otherwise that the show did not keep noise levels at a low range.
House
The tour of season six's mansion was released for public viewing on December 15, 2010, while Oxygen changed their website's homepage for the upcoming season of the Bad Girls Club. The tour of the house was hosted by Steve Leonhardt, the Bad Girls Club production designer, and several days prior to the arrival of the cast of season six, in September 2010. Located in Sherman Oaks, California, season 6's mansion was nearly six miles away from city streets whereas the mansion was nearly three and a half miles away from Pier 39. The girls are welcomed with a medium bachelor pad-styled house with centric add-ons in front of the doorway, signifying a Hollywood mansion. The two-divided country western doors have only one small star-shaped see-through window that are located adjacent to the door knob. The girls are then welcomed with eco-friendly potted plants and dark purple walls that are populated with comments and ratings from major media coverage. Down across the same hallway is a hang-out room that has a circular hot pink couch, which the girls can encounter. Facing towards the hang out room the girls can spot a replica of the Hollywood sign reading "Bad Girls Club". Also located near the hang out room is a bigger size living room which features more bright colors and modern matching furniture that faces bright stars at a dark-colored wall. Above the staircase, the girls can spot a stripperposing adjacent to the Bad Girls Club logo. Scattered across the wall, near the staircase, are pictures of the ladies from Bad Girls Club: Miami, which was the previous season. The production designer decided to upgrade the mansion from previous house styles and gave the girls the Hollywood scene look, stating that the girls of Bad Girls Club are celebrities.
The Bad Girls Club creed became the pigment on one of the main walls in the foyer nearly twenty-four feet tall, which was done for the first time. In previous seasons, the creed was only framed above the fireplace. Leonhardt believed that the creed broke the Guinness Book of World Records for the tallest creed in history. The pool in use was decorated as an indoor pond by placing waterfalls and potted plants around the pool and Jacuzzi, similar to Bad Girls Club season 4's pool. The balcony used was smaller compared from season's four and five, which had used a cabana. Season 6 used a hothouse and applied relaxation beds. Inside the house, producers used neon lights to flash "Bitch" in a star and placing, at the end, "fake" and "real". In seasons past, the Bad Girls had pictures of themselves which they could interact with, which was first introduced in season 3. Season 6 used picture monitors for the girls to express themselves. The girls were also given an indoor Jacuzzi in the dining room to give them more purpose to be in the dining room which producers stated that the girls never interacted in there and wanted to change that for season 6. The dining room expressed pink and black colors which represented a 1950s look. Beyond the dining room, the game room, which features a bar, Ping-Pong table, pool table, murals on the walls, and the BG Spot which became the processor of the "Screaming-O vending machine". In the phone room, producers used classic style black and white photos of Melrose Avenue. Due to the popularity of the exercise equipment, the girls were given an exercise room which had available equipment that they can use to defuse their anger or work out.
The girls were also given a modern kitchen that had pink lights above the stove instead of the white lights that are used in American homes. The girls' rooms were entirely of lime green, baby blue twin beds, and lent king-size beds. The make-up room for season 6 had more mirrors and seating than previous seasons. Throughout the entire house, all seven girls are only given one walk-in closet. In the make-up room there are two, two-way mirrors, which the girls do not know about and believe that it is a private mirror.
Cast
The season began with seven original bad girls, of which two left voluntarily and one was removed by production. Three replacement bad girls were introduced in their absences later in the season.

Van Hulssen Islands is a group of about ten small islands, of which Van Hulssen Island is the largest, lying north of Pila Island in Holme Bay. The islands were mapped by Norwegian cartographers from air photos taken by the Lars Christensen Expedition, 1936–37, and included as part of a group called "Ytterskjera." They were remapped by ANARE (Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions), 1954–62, and named after the largest island in the group.

The Nairobi derby, commonly known as the Mashemeji derby, or Ingo-Dala derby, is the name of the local derby between two major association football teams in Nairobi: A.F.C. Leopards and Gor Mahia. It is the oldest rivalry in Kenyan football history. Fans of both A.F.C. Leopards and Gor Mahia (often referred to by their nicknames, Ingwe and K'Ogalo, respectively) recognize each other as arch-rivals. Gor Mahia has won the Kenyan Premier League a record 18 times, while A.F.C. Leopards have 12 league titles to their name as at 2019.
History
The two clubs have been bitter rivals since they first locked horns on 5 May 1968. In a match on 23 March 2012, Gor Mahia fans began to riot after midfielder Ali Abondo was given a red card following a dangerous tackle on Leopards' Amon Muchiri. Gor Mahia was banned by the Sports Stadia Management Board from using their facilities for the rest of the 2012 season (those being the Nyayo National Stadium and the Kasarani Stadium) as a result. This was also the reason for the postponing of their Round of 8 derby match in the 2012 KPL Top 8 Cup.
Before that, on Heroes' Day 2011, Leopards fans had caused abandonment of an FKL Cup quarter final by pelting linesmen with objects after Gor Mahia went ahead with a superbly worked goal from a Moses Odhiambo and Moses Otieno combination which saw the former head in a superbly taken free kick by the latter. Leopards were made to forfeit the game and controversially escaped further bans despite the 1-0 scoreline being allowed to stand. Gor Mahia went on to memorably lift the Cup beating Sofapaka at the Nairobi City Stadium six days later and earn a right to represent Kenya in the 2012 CAF Confederation Cup.
On 8 June 2014, the two teams faced off again in a Kenyan Premier League match at the Nyayo National Stadium. Having taken the lead in the 24th minute through Timonah Wanyonyi, Gor Mahia conceded the equaliser in the 35th minute when Charles Okwemba sent Jacob Keli through on goal, with Keli slotting home past keeper Jerim Onyango. A.F.C. Leopards had to wait until the second half to take the lead, when Okwemba was fouled by left back David Owino before heading the ball into the back of the net from an Abdallah Juma free kick. Bernard Wanyama sealed the victory for Ingwe in the 73rd minute, after chesting the ball down from an Okwemba lobbed through pass before hitting the cross bar and ending up in the back of the net. The defeat condemned Gor Mahia to their heaviest defeat that season until that point.
Fans and hooliganism
The Gor Mahia fanbase is predominantly Luo while that of AFC leopards is mostly Luhya, making the rivalry partly tribal despite the significant support of "neutrals" (other communities or nationalities) for both clubs. The passion of the fans during encounters between the teams add to the intensity of the derby matches.
Both teams have been involved in cases of hooliganism, but Gor Mahia fans are usually found on the wrong side of the law more often than their A.F.C. Leopards counterparts. After winning their 2013 FKF President's Cup semi-final against Sony Sugar, Gor Mahia fans began celebrating the win, with a huge number of them invading the pitch to attack Sony Sugar players. The incident resulted in Sony Sugar goalkeeper Wycliffe Kasaya being admitted to hospital. Only four days later, the fans attacked Sofapaka officials during a 2013 Kenyan Premier League match. They descended on the club's assistant coach Martin Ndagano and their medic Charles Omondi, forcing them out of the stadium, and making away with the latter's mobile phone in the process.
During a 2014 Kenyan Premier League match against Thika United, A.F.C. Leopards fans descended onto the pitch in the 85th minute in frustration at their side's failure to come back from a 1–0 deficit. The incident cost A.F.C. Leopards the game, as the KPL handed Thika United a 2–0 win and handed A.F.C. Leopards a fine of KSh.500,000/= to be paid by 20 June 2014.

The North Midlands Shield is an annual rugby union knock-out cup club competition organized by the North Midlands Rugby Football Union and was first contested during the 2001–02 season with Ledbury being the first ever winners, defeating Old Saltleians in the final held at Finstall Park in Bromsgrove. It is currently open for clubs ranked in tier 7-8 of the English rugby union system that fall under the North Midlands RFU umbrella, including sides based in Birmingham and the West Midlands, Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire. A tier 9 side, Shropshire based Oswestry, who play in Cheshire (South), also take part. In 2014 the North Midlands RFU introduced a 'Plate' competition for sides eliminated in the early stages of the Shield. It is one of three men's club competitions in the region along with the North Midlands Cup (for tier 5-6 sides) and the North Midlands Vase (for tier 9-10 sides).
The current format is as a knock-out cup with a preliminary round, first round, quarter-final, semi-final and final which is held at a neutral venue in May (2021-22's Final was held at Worcester RFC) along with the cup and vase finals. Due to the disjointed numbers of teams several teams have play in the preliminary round. Teams that lose in either the preliminary or first round stage then contest the plate while winners go on to contest the cup proper.

Erskine Barracks was a military installation at Fugglestone St Peter, in Wilton parish some northwest of Salisbury in Wiltshire, England.
History
The site, which had been farmland until used for temporary army buildings during World War II, was acquired by the British Army for use as a headquarters for Southern Command in 1949. The establishment was centred on Fugglestone Farmhouse and an Ordnance Survey map of 1958 labels it as Fugglestone Camp.
The barracks were later named after General Sir George Erskine, who had been GOC Southern Command from 1955 until his retirement in 1958. The site went on to become in 1968 the headquarters of Army Strategic Command, which was renamed UK Land Forces in 1972 and Land Command in 1995. On 1 April 2008 Land Command amalgamated with Headquarters Adjutant General under 'Project Hyperion' and became Land Forces. Land Forces moved from Erskine Barracks to the former RAF Andover site now known as Marlborough Lines on 23 June 2010, and the site became vacant.
At time, that the site covered 9.6 hectares to the north of the railway line and 3.8 hectares (less fully developed) to the south. The former farmhouse had been demolished by 1968 and all standing structures were from 1950 or later. In 2014 the headquarters building was described as "an impressive example of brutal modernism".
Post-Army use
The site was sold to housebuilder Redrow in March 2013, and all its buildings were demolished in 2014. Besides housing, the site has Erskine House which provides 44 flats for former military personnel, and offers training for their return to civilian work.
Legacy
The National Army Museum has a Bath stone fireplace salvaged during the demolition in 2001 of Bridge End House, a building of c.1900 used as an administrative block by the Army.
During demolition in 2014, a photographic record of selected buildings – including the Sergeants' Mess and the Headquarters – was made by Wessex Archaeology to form a historic building record, as required by Wiltshire Council under a planning condition. No archaeological features were found during a simultaneous watching brief.

Tetragrammaton Records was an American record label founded in 1968 by music industry executives Roy Silver, Bruce Post Campbell, Marvin Deane, and comedian Bill Cosby. Silver, at the time, was also Cosby's manager. The term "Tetragrammaton" refers to the Hebrew name of God considered by some to be unspeakable (YHWH, or "Yahweh", translated as "Jehovah" in English). The label's most successful act was rock band Deep Purple.
History
Tetragrammaton was also responsible for releasing the controversial 1968 Apple Records album, Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins in the United States. This avant-garde album was recorded by John Lennon and Yoko Ono and featured nude photos of the pair on the front and back cover. Tetragrammaton stepped in as distributor after Capitol Records, the usual US distributor for Apple and the Beatles, refused the album, citing a possible negative response from retailers.
The Lennon/Ono album was also declared to be pornography by some authorities. Tetragrammaton went into financial difficulties, which may have been related to the distribution of the Lennon/Ono album. Approximately 30,000 copies of the record were seized by police at a warehouse in New Jersey. The records were held as evidence in a court case, which made it impossible for the label to sell them at the time.
Bill Cosby's 1969 stand-up comedy album, 8:15 12:15, was also released by the label, as were two albums by comedian Murray Roman, You Can't Beat People Up & Have Them Say I Love You and A Blind Man's Movie.
A number of the label's projects were left unissued. Among these were a second album by singer songwriter Elyse Weinberg, and an album by Memphis musician Captain Milk (real name, Edwin Hubbard) who described himself as a "flute picker". Tetragrammaton did however release a single of the Lennon/McCartney song "Hey Jude" from the Captain Milk recording sessions. An English rock band named Bodast also recorded an unreleased album for Tetragrammaton in 1968. The group featured guitarist Steve Howe, later a member of Yes. The Bodast recordings were first released in 1981 by Cherry Red Records.
Despite having several popular artists on its roster, Tetragrammaton ceased trading after declaring bankruptcy in 1970. In 1972, Deep Purple's new label, Warner Bros. Records (also Cosby's former label), reissued various tracks from the group's first three Tetragrammaton albums on one compilation album entitled Purple Passages. In Canada, some of Tetragrammaton's releases were manufactured and distributed by the Canadian division of Polydor Records, which also issued several Canada-only Deep Purple compilations after Tetragrammaton's demise.
Tetragrammaton's co-founder, Marvin Deane, died of heart failure on August 16, 2010, in Los Angeles, California, at age 79.

The Golden Triangle of NSW is an informal locality situated in northwestern New South Wales, Australia. With a reputation for being prime agricultural land, particularly for cereal crops such as wheat and barley, where the term "Golden" is derived.
The agricultural community generally regards this region as being East of the Newell Highway and taking area between the villages of North Star, Croppa Creek and Crooble. Other descriptions widen the area to between the better known towns of Boggabilla, Warialda and Moree, New South Wales.
Less creditable is the description of being the region bounded by the towns of Narrabri, Moree, and Inverell as this area has significant climatic shifts west of the Newell highway, also changes in the geographic features from plains to tablelands and the soil characteristics mean widening the area moves the enterprise mix from substantially cropping to livestock.

The Cabinet of the Hawaiian Kingdom () was a body of the top executive officials appointed to advise the sovereign of the Hawaiian Kingdom from 1845 to 1893. The subsequent regimes of the Provisional Government and the Republic of Hawaii retained the structure of the cabinet (calling it an executive council) and minister positions under the presidency of Sanford B. Dole from 1893 until 1898.
History
Prior to 1845, the king was advised by the Kuhina Nui (premier) and his Council of Chiefs (ʻAha Aliʻi). The first commission of a cabinet-level official was for American missionary Gerrit P. Judd who was appointed Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on November 2, 1843 by Kamehameha III. An 1844 issue of The Polynesian noted the positions of Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Attorney General, and two Secretaries of the Treasury in the Privy Council of State.
By 1845, the positions became known as ministers (kuhina). Judd had become "in fact, though not in name, a prime minister holding three portfolios", acting out the duties of the ministers of foreign affairs, finance and of the interior. He was later replaced as finance minister by Robert Crichton Wyllie and appointed interior minister on March 28, 1845 to alleviate his duties. Kamehameha III increasingly relied on American and British naturalized foreigners to fill executive council posts.
The cabinet with five ministries was officially formed after the passing of "An Act to Organize the Executive Ministry of the Hawaiian Islands" on October 29, 1845, in the Legislature, which formally outlined the appointment of cabinet ministers for the executive branch and the role of a privy council. The members of the cabinet consisted of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of the Interior (combined with the position of Kuhina Nui until 1855), Minister of Finance, and Attorney General. The royal cabinet ministers were also ex-officio members of the House of Nobles in the legislature and the Privy Council of State, the executive council of the monarch. Until 1855, a fifth ministry was headed by the Minister of Public Instruction. This was reorganized into the Board of Education which reported to the legislature through the interior ministry. The first cabinet appointed after the organic acts included Judd (as finance minister), Wyllie (as foreign ministers), John Ricord (as attorney general), William Richards (as public instruction minister), and the part-Hawaiian Keoni Ana (as Kuhina Nui and interior minister).
Subsequent Hawaiian constitutions in 1852, 1864 and 1887 outlined the role and duties of the cabinet ministry. The 1864 constitution proclaimed by King Kamehameha V abolished the position of Kuhina Nui and its role as the head of the cabinet. During the later years of the monarchy, the stability of cabinet appointments came into question with the appointment of questionable or unpopular candidates such as Celso Caesar Moreno and Walter Murray Gibson by King Kalākaua. Cabinets in this era were named after the de facto heads, usually but not always the foreign minister. The 1887 constitution forced upon Kalākaua increased the power of the cabinet (then known as the Reform Cabinet) at the expense of the monarch, who had to have the cabinet's consent for all executive actions except ministerial appointments and vetoes of legislation. It retained the monarch's right to appoint his or her own cabinet minister but gave the legislature the power to vote for the dismissal of the cabinet.
This constitution change proved especially problematic in the 1892–1893 legislative session where the retention of a stable cabinet was the main issue of contention between Queen Liliʻuokalani and the legislators. Seven resolutions of want of confidence were introduced during this session, and four of her self-appointed cabinets (the Widemann, Macfarlane, Cornwell, and Wilcox cabinets) were ousted by votes of the legislature. On January 13, 1893, after the legislature dismissed the Wilcox cabinet, Liliʻuokalani appointed the new Parker cabinet consisting of Samuel Parker, as minister of foreign affairs; John F. Colburn, as minister of the interior; William H. Cornwell, as minister of finance; and Arthur P. Peterson, as attorney general.
These men had been specifically appointed to support her plan of promulgating a new constitution while the legislature was not in session. She attempted to promulgate a new constitution, but the cabinet ministers were either opposed to or reluctant to sign the new constitution. Their opposition was one of the causes which ultimately led to the Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom on January 17, 1893.

Mary Millicent Miller (née Mary Millicent Garretson; 1846 – October 30, 1894) was an American steamboat master who was the first American woman to acquire a steamboat master's license.
Biography
Miller was born in 1846 in Portland, Kentucky to Andrew and Luanna Garretson. The daughter of a steamboat engineer she was immersed into a life on the river. On August 3, 1865 she married widower George 'Old Natural' Miller; a well respected steamboat builder and pilot. Together they had four children Lula Ann, Georgia, Emily, and Norman as well as three children from George's previous marriages. During the summer months they would live in a house in Portland where George Miller built boats on Shippingport Island. One such boat was the Saline; a 178-ton steamboat. During the fall, winter, and occasionally spring months of the year the Millers and their children would travel to New Orleans on the Saline and live on the boat while transporting freight and people on the Mississippi, Red, Ouchita, and Ohio Rivers.
While sailing the Saline Mary Miller would serve as the ship's clerk and bookkeeper while George piloted it and a son from George's previous marriage acted as the engineer. In 1883 in an attempt to put the Millers out of business a competing steamboat company, the Banks Line, informed the Steamboat Inspection Service (SIS) that George was acting as both the master and the pilot of his steamboat. A criminal offense. When questioned by the SIS George confirmed that he was, indeed, the pilot but that Mary was the ship's master and that she would be applying for a steamboat master's license.
When Miller applied for a license the New Orleans Inspector of Hulls office was unsure if it could license a woman. Inspector George L. Norton believed it was improper for a woman to hold such a position and did not render a decision for eight months. After which in November 1883 he sent her application to the Secretary of the Treasury in Washington, D.C. Upon receiving her application Secretary Charles J. Folger was equally bewildered and to which he asked "has Mrs. Miller a husband living?" In January 1884 Secretary Folger rendered his decision and telegraphed the New Orleans office the "Mrs. Miller should be granted her license if she were fit for performing the duties required, without regard to her sex".
Miller passed the examinations and was formally granted her master's license on February 16, 1884 at the age of thirty-eight. That same day, Harper's Weekly ran a cartoon entitled, "By All Means Commission The Ladies" and her picture appeared in the same publication on March 8, 1884. Respected steamboat masters publicly proclaimed her great skill in New Orleans newspapers, while her accomplishment allowed for other females to become steamboat pilots and masters.
By 1890 competition from the expanding railroad industry was hurting the steamboat business. That coupled with George Miller's advanced age lead the Millers to sell the Saline and retire. While in Portland George built a sailboat named the Swan and in December 1891 the Millers sailed the swan towards New Orleans. Intending for Miller to become a lighthouse keeper in East Pascagoula, Mississippi. During the trip Miller became ill, returned to Portland, and had the Swan towed back upriver by a coal boat. Miller would die in Portland on October 30, 1894 of paralysis and was later buried at Portland Cemetery.
Legacy
Mary Miller was twice recognized in the 1990s for her pioneering effort. The American Merchant Marine Hall of Fame inducted her in 1993. In 1995 she was recognized by the National Rivers Hall of Fame. The Portland Museum keeps a permanent exhibit about her. In July 2017 the City of Louisville, Kentucky renamed the recently acquired steamboat the Georgia Queen to the Mary M. Miller in her honor.

Development
On May 12, 2016, Warner Bros. Television announced that Supergirl had been renewed for a second season of 22 episodes and would move to The CW from CBS. Ali Adler and Andrew Kreisberg served as the season's showrunners. It was also announced that, beginning with this season, production would relocate to Vancouver from Los Angeles.
Writing
In the second season, Kara Danvers / Supergirl and James Olsen end their romantic relationship, in favor of maintaining a platonic one. Kreisberg said regarding this decision, "We realized that the best scenes between [Kara and James] were just the nice, sweet scenes where they were being friends." He also said that while the theme of the first season was "how does Kara become Supergirl?", the theme of the second would be "how does Supergirl become Kara?". Kriesberg said another theme of the season was "about coming into one's own and becoming who you are", such as Winn Schott becoming who he is by joining the Department of Extranormal Operations (DEO), and J'onn J'onzz embracing his Martian Manhunter persona, which he spent 300 years concealing, but does not have to any longer. The season is split in two-halves each with their own self-contained "big bad" story: Project Cadmus serves as the "big bad" of the first half, and Queen Rhea for the second half.
The season establishes that Alex Danvers is gay, with Maggie Sawyer being her partner. Chyler Leigh, who plays Alex, explained, "it's not like this thing that all of a sudden is just spilling out, it's a discovery for her". She added, "You have so many stories [...] where people are already established as gay, lesbian, bi[sexual]; these are people who are coming in like that" and described the second season as a "great opportunity to show somebody who's figuring it out, the light bulb moment and putting the puzzle pieces together." While the first season showed that the DEO operates in an isolated cave located "in the middle of nowhere", the second season shows that the DEO has relocated to their other base, a skyscraper in National City. Kreisberg explained that the creative team of Supergirl "fell out of love" with the DEO's cave setting, saying "It was cool in the beginning, and it just for some reason didn't feel like it was bringing everything together", hence the reason for shifting to the skyscraper setting.
Casting
Melissa Benoist, Mehcad Brooks, Chyler Leigh, Jeremy Jordan, and David Harewood return from the first season as Kara Danvers / Supergirl, James Olsen, Alex Danvers, Winn Schott and J'onn J'onzz / Martian Manhunter, respectively. They are joined by Katie McGrath, Chris Wood and Floriana Lima, playing Lena Luthor, Mon-El and Maggie Sawyer, respectively. Harewood also portrays Hank Henshaw, who becomes this series' version of Cyborg Superman. The season establishes Olsen as the vigilante Guardian, unlike the comics where Jim Harper is the vigilante. The producers decided to depict Sawyer as a Latino for the series, unlike the comics where she is a white blonde; however, the character's homosexuality was retained for the series.
With the move of production to Vancouver, it was unclear if Calista Flockhart, who played Cat Grant in the first season, would remain with the series, as her original contract stipulated that she work near her home in Los Angeles. The CW president Mark Pedowitz said Flockhart wanted to remain with the series and that "We're in ongoing discussions... we're happy to have her in [in whatever capacity] works out." Flockhart ultimately reached a deal to be recurring in the second season. Andrea Brooks originally auditioned for the role of Sawyer, although she herself admitted that she did not feel that role was a "good fit". She was subsequently sent a further script to audition for the role of Janice. Having won the role, it was not until she received her first episode script that she discovered she would in fact be playing the recurring role of Eve Teschmacher. The character's name is a reference to a character of the same name played by Valerie Perrine in Superman (1978) and its 1980 sequel.
Design
Tyler Harron worked as the production designer for the season. With the move of the production to Vancouver from Los Angeles, Harron decided to take elements from the existing sets and rebuild them in Vancouver from scratch, rather than pack the sets such as CatCo and Kara Danver's loft, ship them to Vancouver and rebuild them there. This was done due to the difficulty of having separate crews to ship the sets to Vancouver and unpack them there. Kara's loft was designed to look almost exactly as it was in the first season, while CatCo was substantially redesigned.
Filming
The second season was filmed in Vancouver, rather than Los Angeles where the first season was shot. This was done to reduce the high production costs of the series, one of the issues that made CBS wary to renew the series on their network. Kriesberg explained that it "would've started to feel very small" if production had continued in Los Angeles, and that they chose to relocate to Vancouver to shoot in its outdoor locations, rather than continue facing the constraints of shooting mainly inside the studio at Los Angeles. Pedowitz said the series' move to Vancouver made crossovers with another CW superhero series, The Flash, "easier to facilitate" as the series also films in Vancouver. Filming for the season began in July 2016, and ended in April 2017.
Music
The score for the season was composed by Blake Neely.
Arrowverse tie-ins
The episode "Medusa" ends with a scene where Barry Allen and Cisco Ramon of Earth-1 arrive at Kara's loft enlisting her help with a problem on their Earth, thereby setting up the Arrowverse crossover event "Invasion!" that begins on The Flash season 3 episode 8, continues on Arrow season 5 episode 8 and concludes on Legends of Tomorrow season 2 episode 7. This scene is later repeated in the Flash episode of the crossover. Kara/Supergirl appears in all three episodes as a visitor to their universe due to Supergirl being set in a different Earth, referred to as Earth-38 by the inhabitants of the Arrowverse, and has been informally referred to as "Earth-CBS" by Arrow showrunner Marc Guggenheim, named for the network where Supergirl first aired. Similarly, the episode "Star-Crossed" ends with Music Meister hypnotizing Kara and fleeing to Earth-1 to do the same to Barry, thus initiating the events of The Flash season 3 episode "Duet".
Release
Broadcast
The season began airing on The CW on October 10, 2016, in the United States, and ended on May 22, 2017. It premiered on the same day as the United States in Canada on Showcase, and on October 24, 2016, in the United Kingdom on Sky One.
Home media
The season was released on DVD in Region 2 on August 21, 2017, on DVD and Blu-ray in Region 1 on August 22, and DVD Region 3 on August 23.
Reception
Ratings
Critical response
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the second season a 92% approval rating from critics with an average rating of 7.91/10, based on 19 reviews. The site's consensus reads, "The arrival of the more famous cousin in Supergirl does nothing to detract from the show's lead, who continues to deliver strength, action, and relatability." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 81 out of 100 based on 4 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".
Jesse Schedeen of IGN rated the season 7.3 out of 10, giving the verdict, "In many ways, Supergirl improved in its second season as the show moved to The CW and bolstered its already solid cast with several new favorites. This season not only looked better, it managed to blend epic superhuman conflicts with very real, authentic character drama and a status quo marked by plenty of anti-alien sentiment in National City. But not every character benefited from the shake-ups this season, and not every lingering Season 1 problem was addressed. And while the season as a whole had more good elements than bad, the final trio of lackluster episodes managed to end the year on a real down note." Evan Valentine of Collider ranked the season at number 10 in his list of best and worst superhero television series of 2017, writing, "Supergirl is a stalwart within a sea of superhero shows, not necessarily standing out, but not ever being terrible. Melissa Benoist still does a fantastic job of portraying “the Girl of Steel,” but we are hitting Smallville-levels of drama with the rest of the characters".
PopMatters writer James Plath rated the season 7 out 10 stars.

Ernest Hutcheson (20 July 1871 – 9 February 1951) was an Australian pianist, composer and teacher.
Biography
Hutcheson was born in Melbourne, and toured there as a child prodigy at the age of five. He later travelled to Leipzig and entered the Leipzig Conservatory at the age of fourteen to study with Carl Reinecke, Bernhard Stavenhagen (a pupil of Franz Liszt) and Bruno Zwintscher. He was part of the London music circuit in 1896 and 1897. Prior to the outbreak of World War I he taught at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin, but in 1914 he settled in New York City, where he made his US debut.
He is believed to have been the first pianist to play three concertos of Ludwig van Beethoven in a single concert: his performances of Beethoven's third, fourth and fifth with the New York Symphony Orchestra in the Aeolian Hall in 1919.
He became a member of the faculty at the Juilliard School, and successively Dean (1926–1937) and President (1937–1945) of the school. At Juilliard, he championed the use of radio musical broadcasts in education.
He taught many first-rate students. One of these many students was Mary Ann Craft, who later taught the prodigy Edgar Coleman during his formative years. Two other students who went on to important pianistic careers were the American Abram Chasins, and the Australian Bruce Hungerford. He also taught Muriel Kerr, a winner of the Naumberg Competition who made her Carnegie Hall debut 5 December 1928 in Rachmaninoff's Concerto No. 2 with the Philharmonic SO of New York conducted by Willem Mengelberg. She became Hutcheson's assistant at Juilliard and later toured under Columbia Artists Management, settling finally in Los Angeles where she taught at the University of Southern California. Hutcheson was a member of the Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity.
At Chautauqua
Hutcheson was also associated with the Chautauqua School of Music at the Chautauqua Institution in Western New York State. Hutcheson provided a much-needed refuge for George Gershwin at Chautauqua during the stressful period of composing and refining the Piano Concerto in F. Since Gershwin was already very famous as a successful writer of popular works and musical shows, he was constantly besieged by admirers. Further, he had never scored a large symphonic work (the earlier Rhapsody in Blue had been scored for jazz band by Gershwin, but was orchestrated by Ferde Grofé) and was under great stress from the pressing deadline expectations from Walter Damrosch, conductor of the New York Symphony, who had commissioned the Concerto in F. Thanks to Ernest Hutcheson's kind offer of seclusion for Gershwin at Chautauqua where his quarters were declared off limits to everyone until 4 p.m. daily, Gershwin was able to successfully complete his piano concerto on time.
Works
Ernest Hutcheson wrote concertos for piano; 2 pianos; and violin, and many solo piano works, such as a transcription of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries. His music has been little heard in concert or on recordings, but his Australian compatriot Ian Munro has recorded some of his piano pieces.
Hutcheson wrote important books The Literature of the Piano, The Elements of Piano Technique, A Musical Guide to Richard Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung, and Elektra, by Richard Strauss: a Guide to the Opera with Musical Examples from the Score, among others.

S8, SB7, SM8 are disability swimming classifications used for categorizing swimmers based on their level of disability. This class includes a number of different disabilities including people with amputations and cerebral palsy. The classification is governed by the International Paralympic Committee, and competes at the Paralympic Games.
Definition
This classification is for swimming. In the classification title, S represents Freestyle, Backstroke and Butterfly strokes. SB means breaststroke. SM means individual medley. The number following indicates degree of disability, with one being the most severely physically impaired to ten having the least amount of physical disability. According to the International Paralympic Committee, examples of those eligible for the S8, SB8 and SM8 classes include "Swimmers who have lost either both hands or one arm [...] also, athletes with severe restrictions in the joints of the lower limbs." Jane Buckley, writing for the Sporting Wheelies, an Australian disability association, describes the swimmers in this classification as having: "full use of their arms and trunk with some leg function; Swimmers with coordination problems mainly in the lower limbs; Both legs amputated just above or just below the knee; Single above elbow amputation."
Disability types
This class includes people with several disability types include cerebral palsy and amputations.
Amputee
ISOD amputee A2, A3, A6, A8 and A9 swimmers may be found in this class. Prior to the 1990s, the A2, A3, A6, A8 and A9 classes were often grouped with other amputee classes in swimming competitions, including the Paralympic Games.
Upper limb amputees
S8 and S9 amputee swimmers in this class have similar start times to people with legs amputations in S8 to S10 classes. S8 amputee swimmers in this class have much shorter points of entry into the water off the block. Compared to able bodied swimmers, amputee swimmers in this class have a shorter stroke length and increased stroke rate. Because their legs are their greatest strength, they modify their entry into the water to take advantage of this.
The nature of a person's amputations in this class can effect their physiology and sports performance. Because they are missing a limb, amputees are more prone to overuse injuries in their remaining limbs. Common problems for intact upper limbs for people in this class include rotator cuffs tearing, shoulder impingement, epicondylitis and peripheral nerve entrapment.
Lower limb amputees
A3 swimmers in this class have a similar stroke length and stroke rate comparable to able bodied swimmers. A study of was done comparing the performance of swimming competitors at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. It found there was no significant difference in performance in times between men and women in A2 and A3 in the 50 meter breaststroke, men and women in A2 and A3 in the 50 meter freestyle, men and women in A2, A3 and A4 in the 25 meter butterfly, and men in A2 and A3 in the 50 meter backstroke.
The nature of an A2 and A3 swimmers's amputations in this class can effect their physiology and sports performance. Because of the potential for balance issues related to having an amputation, during weight training, amputees are encouraged to use a spotter when lifting more than . Lower limb amputations effect a person's energy cost for being mobile. To keep their oxygen consumption rate similar to people without lower limb amputations, they need to walk slower. A3 swimmers use around 41% more oxygen to walk or run the same distance as some one without a lower limb amputation. A2 swimmers use around 87% more oxygen to walk or run the same distance as some one without a lower limb amputation.
Upper and lower limb amputations
ISOD amputee A9 swimmers may be found in several classes. These include S2, S3, S4, S5 and S8. Prior to the 1990s, the A9 class was often grouped with other amputee classes in swimming competitions, including the Paralympic Games. Swimmers in this class have a similar stroke length and stroke rate to able bodied swimmers.
The nature of a person's amputations in this class can effect their physiology and sports performance. Because of the potential for balance issues related to having an amputation, during weight training, amputees are encouraged to use a spotter when lifting more than . Lower limb amputations effect a person's energy cost for being mobile. To keep their oxygen consumption rate similar to people without lower limb amputations, they need to walk slower. Because they are missing a limb, amputees are more prone to overuse injuries in their remaining limbs. Common problems with intact upper limbs for people in this class include rotator cuffs tearing, shoulder impingement, epicondylitis and peripheral nerve entrapment.
Cerebral palsy
This class includes people with several disability types include cerebral palsy. CP7 and CP8 class swimmers are sometimes found in this class. CP7 sportspeople are able to walk, but appear to do so while having a limp as one side of their body is more effected than the other. They may have involuntary muscles spasms on one side of their body. They have fine motor control on their dominant side of the body, which can present as asymmetry when they are in motion. People in this class tend to have energy expenditure similar to people without cerebral palsy.
Because of the neuromuscular nature of their disability, CP7 and CP8 swimmers have slower start times than other people in their classes. They are also more likely to interlock their hands when underwater in some strokes to prevent hand drift, which increases drag while swimming. For S8 classified swimmers with CP, they are able to record long distances underwater. The longest distances Paralympic S8 swimmers can measure are often half that of comparable Olympic counters. This is attributed to neuromuscular related drag issues. CP swimmers are more efficient at above water swimming than underwater swimming. CP8 swimmers experience swimmers shoulder, a swimming related injury, at rates similar to their able-bodied counterparts. When fatigued, asymmetry in their stroke becomes a problem for swimmers in this class. The integrated classification system used for swimming, where swimmers with CP compete against those with other disabilities, is subject to criticisms has been that the nature of CP is that greater exertion leads to decreased dexterity and fine motor movements. This puts competitors with CP at a disadvantage when competing against people with amputations who do not lose coordination as a result of exertion.
CP7 swimmers tend to have a passive normalized drag in the range of 0.6 to 0.8. This puts them into the passive drag band of PDB6, PDB8, and PDB9. CP8 swimmers tend to have a passive normalized drag in the range of 0.4 to 0.9. This puts them into the passive drag band of PDB6, PDB8, and PDB10.
Spinal cord injuries
People with spinal cord injuries compete in this class, including F6 and F8 sportspeople.
F6
This is wheelchair sport classification that corresponds to the neurological level L2 - L5. Historically, this class has been known as Lower 4, Upper 5. People with lesions at L4 have issues with their lower back muscles, hip flexors and their quadriceps. People with lesions at the L4 to S2 who are complete paraplegics may have motor function issues in their gluts and hamstrings. Their quadriceps are likely to be unaffected. They may be absent sensation below the knees and in the groin area.
People in this class have good sitting balance. People with lesions at L4 have trunk stability, can lift a leg and can flex their hips. They can walk independently with the use of longer leg braces. They may use a wheelchair for the sake of convenience. Recommended sports include many standing related sports. People in this class have a total respiratory capacity of 88% compared to people without a disability.
S8 swimmers with spinal cord injuries tend to be complete paraplegics with lesions below L4 to L5. When swimming, they are able to kick but limited use of their ankles means that their propulsion from kicking can be limited. They normally do diving starts from the platform but are not able to get full power because of limited use of their legs. They do leg turns but have limited propulsion power off the wall.
A study of was done comparing the performance of athletics competitors at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between women in 4 (SP5, SP6), 5 (SP6, SP7) and 6 (SP7) in the 100m breaststroke. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between women in 4 (SP5, SP6), 5 (SP6, SP7) and 6 (SP7) in the 100m backstroke. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between women in 4 (SP5, SP6), 5 (SP6, SP7) and 6 (SP7) in the 100m freestyle. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between women in 4 (SP5, SP6), 5 (SP6, SP7) and 6 (SP7) in the 14 x 50 m individual medley. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between men in 4 (SP5, SP6), 5 (SP6, SP7) and 6 (SP7) in the 100m backstroke. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between men in 4 (SP5, SP6), 5 (SP6, SP7) and 6 (SP7) in the 100m breaststroke. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between women in 2 (SP4), 3 (SP4, SP5) and 4 (SP5, SP6) in the 25 m butterfly. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between men in 2 (SP4), 3 (SP4, SP5) and 4 (SP5, SP6) in the 25 m butterfly. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between women in 5 (SP6, SP7) and 6 (SP7) in the 50 m butterfly. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between men in 5 (SP6, SP7) and 6 (SP7) in the 4 x 50 m individual medley. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between men in 5 (SP6, SP7) and 6 (SP7) in the 100 m freestyle.
F8
F8 is standing wheelchair sport class. The level of spinal cord injury for this class involves people who have incomplete lesions at a slightly higher level. This means they can sometimes bear weight on their legs. In 2002, USA Track & Field defined this class as, "These are standing athletes with dynamic standing balance. Able to recover in standing when balance is challenged. Not more than 70 points in legs." In 2003, Disabled Sports USA defined this class as, "In a sitting class but not more than 70 points in the lower limbs. Are unable to recover balance in challenged standing position." In Australia, this class means combined lower plus upper limb functional problems. "Minimal disability." It can also mean in Australia that the athlete is "ambulant with moderately reduced function in one or both lower limbs." They have a normalized drag in the range of 0.6 to 0.7.
History
The classification was created by the International Paralympic Committee and has roots in a 2003 attempt to address "the overall objective to support and co-ordinate the ongoing development of accurate, reliable, consistent and credible sport focused classification systems and their implementation." In 1997, Against the odds : New Zealand Paralympians said this classification was graded along a gradient, with S1 being the most disabled and S10 being the least disabled.
At the Paralympic Games
For the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case-by-case basis.
Competitions
For this classification, organisers of the Paralympic Games have the option of including the following events on the Paralympic programme: 50 m and 100 m Freestyle, 400 m Freestyle, 100 m Backstroke, 100 m Butterfly, 100 m Breaststroke, and 200 m Individual Medley events.
Paralympic records
The table below records the fastest ever Paralympic record in this class for specific events.
Records
In the S8 50 m Freestyle Long Course, the men's world record is held by China's Xiaofu Wang with a time of 00:26.45 and the women's world record is held by China's Shengnan Jiang with a time of 00:30.85. In the S8 100 m Freestyle Long Course, the men's world record is held by Australia's Peter Leek and the women's world record is held by Australia's Maddison Elliott.
Getting classified
Swimming classification generally has three components. The first is a bench press. The second is water test. The third is in competition observation. As part of the water test, swimmers are often required to demonstrate their swimming technique for all four strokes. They usually swim a distance of 25 meters for each stroke. They are also generally required to demonstrate how they enter the water and how they turn in the pool.
Classification generally has four phases. The first stage of classification is a health examination. For amputees in this class, this is often done on site at a sports training facility or competition. The second stage is observation in practice, the third stage is observation in competition and the last stage is assigning the sportsperson to a relevant class. Sometimes the health examination may not be done on site for amputees in this class because the nature of the amputation could cause not physically visible alterations to the body.
In Australia, to be classified in this category, athletes contact the Australian Paralympic Committee or their state swimming governing body. In the United States, classification is handled by the United States Paralympic Committee on a national level. The classification test has three components: "a bench test, a water test, observation during competition." American swimmers are assessed by four people: a medical classified, two general classified and a technical classifier.
Competitors
Swimmers who have competed in this classification include Amanda Everlove, Sean Fraser, and Heather Frederiksen, who all won medals in their class at the 2008 Paralympics.

Euura bridgmanii is a species of sawfly belonging to the family Tenthredinidae (common sawflies). The larvae feed on the leaves of sallows (Salix species). It was first described by the entomologist Peter Cameron in 1883.
Description of the gall
The gall is formed when the female lays her eggs and injects a substance into the leaf. Up to 8 mm x 6 mm in size, the ovoid gall is similar to E. proxima but often develops near to or on the midrib. At first the galls are green, and as the larva grows, soften and turn red. It often has a thin red rim on the upper surface.
Galls of E. bridgmani are found on eared willow (S. aurita]]), goat willow (S. caprea), grey willow (S. cinerea), [[Salix appendiculata|S.appendiculata, S. foetidal, halberd willow (S. hastata), tea-leaved willow (S. phylicifolia), S. silesiaca, S. starkeana and S. waldsteiniana.
Euura bridgmani is one of three closely related species in the Euura proxima group. The others members of the group are,
E. proxima (Serville, 1823)
E. triandrae (Benson, 1941)
Distribution
This species is found in western, central and northern Europe including France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.
Inquilines
Euphranta toxoneura (Loew, 1846) is an inquiline of E. bridgmani and E. proxima. The host larva is killed by the fly and the inquiline feeds on the interior of the gall. When fully grown the inquiline larva leaves the gall, pupating in the soil.

Sirina Camara (born 12 April 1991) is a French footballer who plays for S.League club Home United as a defender. Camara can play either as a left-back or centre-back. Prior to playing for Home United, Camara has also played for Étoile and Young Lions in the S.League.
Early life
Camara was born in an area north of Paris, known as Pierrefitte. His mother was born in Mali and emigrated to France when she was just 18. Camara is born of Malian descent, and is a Muslim. He started playing football in his teenage years, and went on to join the local amateur club, Pierrefitte FC when he was 14. Four years later, he moved to Singapore in order to improve his chances of building a sustainable footballing career, at the advice of his mother. Camara's mother had advised that it would be very tough for him to be a successful player back in France as he was young, but he might get a better opportunity overseas. Camara subsequently made the move after a coach he knew probed if he was interested to play in Singapore.
Club career
After moving to Singapore, Camara signed professional terms with S.League defending champions Étoile, joining the team to play in the 2011 S.League season. He made his debut in a 0-0 draw against Balestier Khalsa. His first goal for the club would come in the 1-1 draw against Home United in the 2011 Singapore Cup. His first league goal came on 27 September 2011, in the 2-1 victory over Hougang United.
Following the withdrawal of Étoile from the 2012 S.League season, Camara moved to Young Lions before signing for Home United in 2013. He won the Singapore Cup in his maiden season with Home United and earned recognition by being awarded the S.League Young Player of the Year award. With Home United, he was also part of the league's strongest defence that season as they finished eventually as the runner-up.
In 2014, Camara was first called up by the Football Association of Singapore to play for the Singapore Selection XI, a squad of players comprising Singapore international footballers and selected players that were playing in the S.League. Camara played subsequently for the Singapore Selection XI in a friendly against Serie A giants Juventus, losing 5-0. In 2015, Camara was selected to join the squad once again to participate in the 2015 Barclays Asia Trophy which was hosted in Singapore. On 15 July 2015 and 18 July 2015 respectively, he played for the squad against Premier League clubs Stoke City and Arsenal, eventually losing 2-0 and 4-0.
Camara scored his first goal of the 2015 S.League season in the 3rd match of the season, scoring the 2nd goal in a 2-0 win over Tampines Rovers to hand Home United their first win of the season. On 12 August 2015, in a rare display of indiscipline, Camara was sent off in the 15th minute of the RHB Singapore Cup quarter-final, first-leg match against Warriors FC, after seen by the referee uttering something to the linesman. Home United played on with ten men for the remainder of the match, even dropping to nine subsequently after teammate Yasir Hanapi received a second yellow card late into the match. Despite the two dismissals, Home United eventually went on to win 2-1.
International career
In July 2013, Camara had indicated he was receptive to the idea of obtaining Singaporean citizenship and playing for the Singapore national football team. National team coach Bernd Stange had been impressed with Camara's ability to play in several positions, adding that he was capable of playing for a top European club. Stange also mentioned that he would call up Camara if he had a Singapore passport.

Park Rangers were a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club based in the Phoenix Park, Dublin.
They were one of the few clubs in Dublin with no juvenile section and had a single junior Football team.
The club was founded in 1966 and the colours were green and gold. Players from the club An Riocht which disbanded in the early 1970s moved to the club while others moved to Clanna Gael/Fontenoy. An Riocht itself was founded in the 1950s following the disbandment of the Peadar Mackens club. The club won its first championship, the Dublin Junior Football Championship E in 2008. Their only previous appearance in a championship final was in 1977.
Due to poor numbers the club merged with Liffey Gaels for the 2012 season.

A Futuro house, or Futuro Pod, is a round, prefabricated house designed by Finnish architect Matti Suuronen, of which fewer than 100 were built during the late 1960s and early 1970s. The shape, reminiscent of a flying saucer, and the structure's airplane hatch entrance has made the houses sought after by collectors. The Futuro is composed of fiberglass-reinforced polyester plastic, polyester-polyurethane, and poly(methyl methacrylate), measuring high and in diameter.
History
The Futuro house was a product of post-war Finland, reflecting the period's faith in technology, the conquering of space, unprecedented economic growth, and an increase in leisure time. It was designed by Suuronen as a ski cabin that would be "quick to heat and easy to construct in rough terrain". The end result was a universally transportable home that had the ability to be mass replicated and situated in almost any environment.
The material chosen for the project—fiberglass-reinforced polyester plastic—was familiar to Suuronen and was previously used in the design of a large plastic dome for the roof of a grain silo in Seinäjoki. To facilitate transport, the house consisted of 16 elements that were bolted together to form the floor and the roof. The project could be constructed on-site, or dismantled and reassembled on-site in two days, or even airlifted in one piece by helicopter to the site. The only necessity on site for its placement were four concrete piers, so the project could occupy nearly any topography. Due to the integrated polyurethane insulation and electric heating system, the house could be heated to a comfortable temperature in only thirty minutes, from .
An excerpt from a February 1970 copy of Architecture d'aujourd'hui describes "Futuro" as:
By the mid-1970s, the house was taken off the market. From the beginning, it had been met with public hostility. Its avant-garde appearance and unfamiliar material influenced the public's reluctance to accept the Futuro House.
The first Futuro House that was erected near Lake Puulavesi in Finland elicited public protest because it looked too unnatural for the rustic environment. In the United States, Futuro Houses were banned from many municipalities by zoning regulations. Banks were reluctant to finance them. Some were vandalised. Some customers who committed to buy them backed out and forfeited their non-refundable $1,000 deposits. Some have been destroyed. In 1999, the city of Tampa ordered a Futuro House demolished. Shortly after the turn of the century, a Futuro House was purchased on Broadkill Beach, Delaware, United States, and destroyed to make way for a double-wide modular home. Some have been vandalised in drive-by shootings.
The oil crisis of 1973 led to an abrupt halt in plastic production. Synthetics became very expensive to produce. Additionally, the public was shifting their view of plastics from a miracle material to an ecological concern. These problems provide context to the discontinuation of the Futuro House. Fewer than 100 were made and it is estimated that today around 60 of the original Futuro Houses survive, owned mostly by private individuals. The prototype (serial number 000) is in the collection of Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The Futuro no. 001, the only other Futuro currently in a public collection, is in the possession of the WeeGee Exhibition Centre in Espoo, Finland.
There are approximately 63 confirmed Futuro Houses in existence across the world. They are in Australia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Japan, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Crimea, Russia, Sweden, South Africa, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and the United States of America.
Conservation
In 2010, Finnish conservator Anna-Maija Kuitunen made a damage assessment plan for the first Futuro ever made (serial number 001). This was done as her final thesis for the Metropolia University of Applied Sciences in Finland ("Futuro no. 001 – documentation and evaluation of preservation need"). The thesis is openly available via the Finnish Theses database and contains a large number of indoor detail photographs and drawings of the Futuro House.
A UK artist, Craig Barnes, purchased and restored a Futuro house in 2013 – 14. He had discovered the wreck whilst on holiday in South Africa and had it shipped back to the UK before commencing restoration. The Futuro house—the only one in the UK—was on display to the public as part of an exhibition on the rooftop of Matt's Gallery, London (until December 2014); the house was featured on the fourth series of the Channel 4 programme George Clarke's Amazing Spaces (Ep. 2).
The Swedish Air Force Museum is restoring a Futuro house. It will be placed in front of the museum at the new playground during May 2021.
One Futuro house was found to be biodegrading due to cyanobacteria and archaea.
Marketing and media
The Futuro home was primarily marketed towards young adults as an avant-garde retreat. Their promotion emphasized the versatility of the home in different locations and an excerpt from a Playboy Magazine advertisement reads, "The FUTURO's steel-legged base is adaptable to virtually any terrain, from flatground to a 20 degree incline ... Ideal for Beach, Skiing, Mountain areas and commercial uses." However, a key limitation to this narrative was the need for electricity and plumbing to be installed in order for the structure to be fully habitable. Many surviving structures have been retrofitted to allow for these needs and as a result the form Suuronen intended is compromised.
Uses
The Futuro House has had many departures from its intended use as a ski chalet.
Australia
One has been located at South Morang, (Melbourne, Victoria) go kart track for more than 25 years where it has been used as a storage unit at the track. Duncan McIntyre bought the Futuro and moved it from its original location in Greensborough (Melbourne, Victoria) to the track. Duncan bought it from a real estate agent who used the Futuro as a temporary booth for sales of land at a new housing estate called Apollo Parkways.
A Futuro House was used as a green room for artists at the Falls Festival in Lorne (Victoria), before its Kyneton owner sold it in 2016 to be shipped to Perth (Australia). Another Futuro House has been in Perth since the late 60s placed on the corner of two roads. Lost Perth Spaceship
One house was located in Darwin and was destroyed by Cyclone Tracy in 1974.
The final houses are located in Deep Creek, South Australia, and on the campus grounds of the University of Canberra. This Futuro, thought to be manufactured in New Zealand, arrived in Canberra in 1972. It spent time at the Canberra Space Dome (Planetarium) and Observatory in Dickson in 1997 and arrived at the University in 2011.
New Zealand
Two Futuro Houses were transported to Christchurch New Zealand for the 1974 New Zealand British Commonwealth Games. These structures, referred to as "Space Banks", were used by the Bank of New Zealand as temporary banking structures. Following the games, the Futuro Houses were put up for sale.
United States
Futuro Homes in the USA were manufactured by the Futuro Corporation of Philadelphia. Some still stand today and many of these structures existed in New Jersey.
At least nine standard Futuro Houses and one Futuro House with eight windows were constructed in New Jersey in the 1970s to 1980s. However, many did not last past the 1980s and were demolished. These pods were installed mostly in shopping centre parking lots. At least one of each model served as small-scale bank branches. This use of these Futuro houses was likely due to zoning regulations at the time that would have made it difficult to live in one.
A Futuro House in Frisco, NC remains a roadside attraction in the Outer Banks. Covered in alien memorabilia and exterior modifications, it has fallen into disrepair.
Documentary
In 1998, Finnish film director Mika Taanila made a short documentary film FuturoA New Stance For Tomorrow about the Futuro house.
In 1969, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) shot a piece on the first kit shipped to Australia.

The Center For Mark Twain Studies is a cultural humanities site associated with Elmira College. The Center manages two historic sites, the Octagonal Study and Quarry Farm, where the American author, Mark Twain, composed many of his works, including Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The center also includes exhibits and archives. It administers research fellowships and delivers extensive programming, including lectures series, symposia, teachers institutes, digital resources, podcasts, and the quadrennial International Conference on the State of Mark Twain Studies.
History and Founding
Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain) first visited Elmira in 1868 at the invitation of Charles Langdon, a young man he had befriended during the Holy Land Excursion of the Quaker City (formerly USS Quaker City), a pleasure cruise which Twain would soon turn into his first bestselling book, The Innocents Abroad (1869). During the trip, Langdon had shown Clemens as picture of his sister, Olivia Langdon. On New Year's Eve 1867, Sam Clemens and Livy Langdon were formally introduced, beginning a courtship which would result in marriage on February 2, 1870.
Shortly after their engagement, Langdon began worrying that her marriage to the itinerant Clemens would permanently sever her from her family, inspiring Clemens to make "an extraordinary promise." Starting the year after they were married, the Clemens family made an annual Summer pilgrimage to Quarry Farm, where they stayed, usually for 3–4 months, with Livy Clemens's older sister and her husband, Theodore and Susan Crane.
In addition to allowing his wife and daughters to maintain strong ties with their extended family and the Elmira community, Sam quickly found that it was an exceptional writing environment. "I can write ten chapters in Elmira where I can write one [in Hartford]," he told a friend in 1875. The previous year, the Cranes had built for him an Octagonal Study, designed to resemble the pilot house on a steamboat, at the peak of East Hill, overlooking the Chemung River Valley, about 100 yards from the main house at Quarry Farm. Here he would compose the majority of four novels, three memoirs, and hundreds of stories, essays, and speeches over the next two decades. In 1886, he told a visiting reporter, "This may be called the home of Huckleberry Finn and other books of mine, for they were written here."
Sam and Livy Clemens made their last extended residency at Quarry Farm in 1903, the year before her death. Both are buried nearby in the Langdon family plot at Elmira's Woodlawn Cemetery. But the property remained in the Langdon family for generations, until it was entrusted to Elmira College in 1982, the official founding of the Center For Mark Twain Studies, by Jervis Langdon Jr. Livy Clemens had been a student at Elmira Female College and her father, Jervis Langdon, was among the college's founders. The family ties to the college were deepened when the Clemens's niece, Ida Langdon, became a professor there. She arranged for the Octagonal Study to be relocated from Quarry Farm to the Elmira College campus in 1952. Her nephew, Langdon Jr., was the final member of the family to reside at Quarry Farm. He set the terms of the agreement with Elmira College that Quarry Farm would never be open to the general public, but would be reserved for promoting scholarship about Mark Twain and his circle.
Quarry Farm Fellows
In observance of Langdon Jr.'s mandate, CMTS sponsors an annual fellowship competition for scholarly "scholarship and creative works related to Mark Twain, including, but not limited to, his literature, life, family, associations, influences, reception, and significance." In 2022, they made awards to 11 Fellows, each of whom was granted a 1-4 week residency at Quarry Farm, as well as an honorarium and access to archival collections. One fellowship was reserved for a creative writer, one for a visual artist, and three for early career researchers.
Programming
The Trouble Begins Lectures
In 1985, the sesquicentennial of Sam Clemens's birth and the centennial of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, CMTS launched its first lecture series, The Trouble Begins at 8, the title draw from the advertising for Twain's first lecture. The initial program features five lecturers, including Leo Marx and Henry Nash Smith. The series was expanded in 1988 and several times since. Since 2017, it has consisted of 10-12 lectures each year, split between "The Barn," an auditorium retrofitted for the purpose on the Quarry Farm grounds, and the Elmira College campus, as well as additional Summer lectures at the Park Church. Many lectures, going back to the initial program in 1985, are recorded and archived on the CMTS website.
The International Conference on The State of Mark Twain Studies
Every four years, CMTS hosts a conference for hundreds of Twain researchers. The first gathering took place in 1989. The 2021 conference was postponed until 2022.

The Cherokee Path (or Keowee path) was the primary route of English and Scots traders from Charleston to Columbia, South Carolina in Colonial America. It was the way they reached Cherokee towns and territories along the upper Keowee River and its tributaries. In its lower section it was known as the Savannah River. They referred to these towns along the Keowee and Tugaloo rivers (in modern Georgia) as the Lower Towns, in contrast to the Middle Towns in Western North Carolina and the Overhill Towns in present-day southeastern Tennessee west of the Appalachian Mountains.
History
In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Cherokee Path was used by English and Scots traders based in Charles Town.
The path was mapped in 1730 by George Hunter, the Surveyor-General of the Province of South Carolina. He noted that it ran from Charlestown to the Congarees, a fort at the confluence of the Saluda and Broad rivers. (This site later was designated as the state capital and named Columbia.) The Path continued across the western frontier to the colonial settlement of Ninety Six, indicated on the map by the number "96". The British constructed Fort Prince George near Cherokee Country.
It was a total of from Charlestown to Keowee, the principal Cherokee town of what the colonists called the Lower Towns along the Keowee River and its tributaries (in present-day Oconee, Greenville, Pickens and Anderson counties), which extended into northeastern Georgia.
Later colonists developed a wagon road, called the Indian Trail (taken from the Cherokee Trail), that extended to near Orangeburg. In the 20th century, SC 3 was constructed, following much of this path to Monetta, South Carolina before going to Ninety Six. Remnants of both these original pathways are visible in many places to the side of the nearby modern roads that parallel them.
From Keowee, one path branched southwest into the Unaka Mountains, usually following the streams and valleys where Cherokee towns were located along the Keowee and Tugaloo rivers, to Clayton, Georgia. The main path continued to the Cherokee Middle Towns along the upper Little Tennessee River and its tributaries, where the later European-American settlements of Franklin and Murphy developed in North Carolina). Traders continued across the Appalachian Mountains to what were known as the Overhill Towns in eastern Tennessee, along the lower Little Tennessee and Tellico rivers.
During the French and Indian War, the British built Fort Loudoun, in 1756 at the confluence of the Tellico River and the lower Little Tennessee River, in present-day Monroe County, southeastern Tennessee. It was part of British support for the Cherokee, who were their allies for a period. But by 1760 there were armed confrontations between the two groups, and the Cherokee suffered some defeats. They sued for peace, and in 1762 Henry Timberlakes conducted a peace expedition to the Overhill Towns. was re-established in 1762.
During the American Revolution, the Cherokee Path was used as a military road by rebel militia raised by the states of Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia against the Cherokee, who had raided numerous frontier settlements in June 1776. In the fall of 1776 the groups of Rutherford's Light Horse expedition invaded the Cherokee towns throughout the region, attacking and destroying many towns in all three geographic groups. They were trying to suppress Cherokee warriors. During the Revolution, the Cherokee were allied with the British Loyalists, hoping to push the rebels out of their territory.
Cherokee Path, Sterling Land Grant
The Cherokee Path, Sterling Land Grant is a section of the historic path located near St. Matthews, Calhoun County, South Carolina. In 1704, George Sterling received a proprietary land grant for 570 acres of land along Ox Creek, later called Lyon's Creek. He was one of the area's first European-American settlers in what was organized as the Orangeburg District and later Calhoun County. His family's plantation was often a stopping place for traders and other travelers along the Cherokee Path. Calhoun County is one of the few counties in South Carolina where portions of the original path remain visible. The site of the grant is a deserted, overgrown field dotted with scattered trees. Two acres, crossed by the Cherokee Path, is the portion of the Sterling Land Grant listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.
Present-day
South Carolina Highway 11 (the Cherokee Foothills Scenic Highway) was constructed along or near some of the original path.

Richard Shane Reynolds (born March 26, 1968) is a former starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played from 1992 through 2004 for the Houston Astros, Atlanta Braves and Arizona Diamondbacks. Listed at 6' 3", 210 lb., Reynolds batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Bastrop, Louisiana.
College career
Reynolds attended Ouachita Christian High School in Monroe, Louisiana, where he earned three All-State selections. He later attended the Faulkner University in Montgomery, Alabama and University of Texas at Austin, where he was a two-time Southwest Conference first team selection, even though his high school coach often made the comment that Reynolds was a far better player at basketball than baseball.
Major League career
The Astros selected Reynolds in the 3rd round of the 1989 MLB Draft. Reynolds made his debut on July 20, 1992, as the starting pitcher against the Pittsburgh Pirates in Houston. He went innings while allowing six runs on eight hits as the Astros lost 11–8. He appeared in seven further games in the next two months (starting four of them), going 1–3 in those games. It was his last game where he pitched his longest outing with five innings pitched, although he ended up with a 4–2 win. Overall, he struck out 10 batters while walking six on a 7.11 ERA. The following year, he would appear in just five total games, pitching twice in July and three times in the final eight games of the year (mostly as the middle reliever, although he did start Game 162). In total he pitched just eleven innings and struck out ten batters with six walks.
1994 was his first full year with the team. He went 8–5 with a 3.05 ERA while appearing in 33 games (14 starts). He pitched 124 innings while having 110 strikeouts and 21 walks. He received votes for Rookie of the Year, finishing 11th. The next year, he followed it up with more games as a starter, going 10–11 with a 3.47 ERA while pitching in 30 games for 189.1 innings. He struck out 175 batters while walking 37. Reynolds made his first start on Opening Day in 1996, doing so against the Los Angeles Dodgers at the Astrodome. He went five innings while allowing four runs on seven hits with five strikeouts and three walks in a 4-3 losing effort. That year, he went 16–10 with a 3.65 ERA in 35 games while pitching a career high 239 innings and striking out 204 and walking 44 while finishing 9th in Cy Young Award voting.
He started the 1997 season as the starter against the Atlanta Braves in the Astrodome. He went eight innings while allowing one run on seven hits in a 2–1 victory. He went 9–10 with a 4.23 ERA in 30 games while pitching 181 innings and having 152 strikeouts and 47 walks. With the Astros that year, they made the playoffs as the NL Central champions and faced off against the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS. Trying to avoid elimination, Reynolds pitched in Game 3 against John Smoltz in Houston. The Braves took the lead in the first inning on a two-out home run by Chipper Jones while a Jeff Blauser RBI single ultimately proved the winning run as Reynolds pitched six innings and allowed two runs on five hits as the Braves won 4–1.
His most productive season came in 1998, when he posted career numbers with a 19–8 record and a 3.51 earned run average in innings of work. The Astros once again prevailed in the NL Central that year, and they faced off against the San Diego Padres in the NLDS. In Game 2, he went seven innings while allowing two runs on four hits although he would receive a no-decision in the 5-4 walk-off win (the only one in the series for the Astros). He followed with a 16–14 mark and a 3.85 ERA in 1999, while leading the league with 35 starts for the 2nd straight year. For the third straight year the Astros made it to the playoffs, and he would be the starting pitcher in Game 1. Facing the Braves and their ace Greg Maddux, Reynolds pitched six innings and allowed one run on seven hits as he prevailed over the Braves 6-1 for his only postseason win. In Game 4, he would last just five innings while allowing nine hits and four runs in 7–5 loss.
In addition, he collected 15 or more wins and logged 200 or more innings in 1996 and from 1998 to 1999. As a result, Reynolds reached his 100th win and hurled more than 200 innings quicker than did Nolan Ryan in an Astros uniform. He finished in the top six of strikeouts for a National League pitcher in 1995, 1996, 1998, and 1999 while leading in games started in 1998 and 1999 (35 each).
Reynolds made the Opening Day start in 2000, which made him the third Astro to have made five Opening Day starts (J.R. Richard and Mike Scott). Facing against Pittsburgh at the last Opening Day game held at Three Rivers Stadium, he went seven innings and allowed two runs on six hits while striking out four in a win as the Astros prevailed 5–2. He got onto a 5–0 start (with four no-decisions) before losing his first game on May 27. Leading into the MLB All-Star Game, he was on a downturn, as he was 6–5 in 18 games before his All-Star selection (his first and only in his career). He pitched just four games after that for the season.
In 2001, he bounced back in some ways, going 14–11 with a 4.34 ERA in 28 games while pitching 182.2 innings and striking out 102 and walking 36. In the 2001 NLDS that year, he faced the Braves once again. With the league-best Astros on the ropes in Game 3, he was tasked against John Burkett to have them live another day. However, he went just four innings while allowing four runs as the Braves swept the series with a 6–2 win.
He regressed in his last year with the Astros for 2002, appearing in just 13 games while going 3–6 with a 4.86 ERA in 74 innings while striking out 47 and walking 26. He was granted free agency after the season but signed back with the team with the intent of playing the 2003 season. However, he was released on March 27; he was signed by the Braves on April 10. He went 11–9 with a 5.43 ERA in 30 games (29 starts) and 167.1 innings pitched. He had 94 strikeouts and 59 walks (a career high). On October 28, he was released by the Braves. On January 6, 2004, he was signed by the Arizona Diamondbacks. He pitched in just one game on June 28, going two innings and allowing six runs and hits in a loss to the San Diego Padres. On October 28, he was released.
Coaching career
In 2013, Reynolds moved back to the Monroe/Bastrop area to become an assistant coach for his alma Mater, Ouachita Christian School.
Honors
Following all his accomplishments in Major League Baseball, Reynolds entered the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame as part of the Class of 2014 induction class. Previously, Houston inducted Reynolds into its Astros Walk of Fame in 2012.

Joshua David Willingham (born February 17, 1979) is a former American professional baseball left fielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Florida Marlins, Washington Nationals, Oakland Athletics, Minnesota Twins and Kansas City Royals.
Early years
He was born in Florence, Alabama to David and Denise Willingham where he played high school baseball and basketball at Mars Hill Bible School. Willingham attended college at the University of North Alabama. He played shortstop and was a two-time All-Gulf South Conference selection (1999, 2000) and a 2-time American Baseball Coaches Association All American. He is a member of Sigma Chi fraternity, Eta Rho Chapter.
Professional career
Florida Marlins
The Florida Marlins selected Willingham in the 17th round, with the 491st overall selection, of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft. He made his MLB debut on July 6, 2004, against the Pittsburgh Pirates but did not garner regular playing time until 2006.
After struggling to find a fielding position for Willingham, as his advanced hitting abilities did not allow him the opportunity to develop defensively, the Marlins made Willingham their starting left-fielder during the 2006 season in wake of the Marlins's "market correction" in the 2005 offseason.
On April 4, 2006, Willingham recorded his first career multi-homer game, launching two against the Houston Astros. He ended the 2006 season with a solid line of .277/.356/.496 with 26 home runs and 74 runs batted in.
2007 proved to be another successful season for Willingham in his sophomore season. He maintained a solid batting average while hitting 21 home runs and 89 runs batted in. He became the team's regular left fielder in 2007, making just three errors in 223 total chances.
Willingham saw a reduced amount of playing time in 2008 due to a 50-game stint on the disabled list, appearing in just over 100 games as opposed to over 140 in the previous two years. His production suffered as his batting average regressed (.258) and his home run totals dipped to 15 on the season. He homered in 4 straight games for first time in career, September 21–26.
Washington Nationals
On November 11, 2008, Willingham was traded to the Washington Nationals, along with pitcher Scott Olsen for Emilio Bonifacio, Jake Smolinski, and P.J. Dean. Willingham began 2009 as the Nationals' fifth outfielder behind Adam Dunn, Elijah Dukes, Austin Kearns, and Lastings Milledge. In May, however, Kearns was sidelined with a fractured foot, giving Willingham a starting role. Dunn was eventually moved to first base and Milledge was traded for then-Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder Nyjer Morgan. Willingham was very productive, proving himself worthy of the everyday left fielder position. On July 27, 2009, Willingham became the 13th player in MLB history to hit two grand slams in the same game and the 7th in MLB history to accomplish this feat in back to back innings. He ended the season with a line of .260/.367/.496 with 24 home runs and 61 RBIs. Having secured the starting left field job, Willingham was productive in the Nationals lineup in 2010. He batted 5th behind sluggers Ryan Zimmerman and Adam Dunn.
Oakland Athletics
On December 16, 2010, Willingham was traded to the Oakland Athletics for pitcher Henry Rodríguez and outfielder Corey Brown. His 2011 batting average of .246 was his lowest since his rookie season, but he reached career pinnacles in home runs (29) and RBIs (98). Willingham won the 2011 Catfish Hunter Award.
Minnesota Twins
On December 15, 2011, Willingham signed a 3-year deal with the Minnesota Twins worth $21 million.
Willingham was named AL Player of the Week for the week of April 9–15. Willingham hit 10-22 with 3 HR in 3 consecutive games and 4 RBI, getting a hit in every single game. Willingham singled in the 9th inning of a game on April 21, 2012 to tie Kirby Puckett's franchise record of getting a hit in the first 15 games of the season. On May 29, Willingham hit a two-out, three-run, walk-off HR against the Athletics. By mid-June, Willingham had hit 14 home runs before finishing the season with a career high 35 Willinghams home run total tied him with Bob Allison's 35 home runs in 1963 for the most by a Minnesota Twin (following their move in 1961) not named Harmon Killebrew.
Kansas City Royals
On August 11, 2014, Willingham was traded to the Kansas City Royals for RHP Jason Adam. In September, he announced that the 2014 season would be his last. He hit a bloop single in the 2014 American League Wild Card Game and was taken out for pinch runner Jarrod Dyson. That would turn out to be the game-tying run that would send the game to extra innings.
Willingham officially announced his retirement on November 24, 2014.
Personal
Willingham is married to his high school sweetheart, Ginger Jaynes Willingham. They have three sons: Rhett, Ryder, and Rogan. Josh and Ginger started a charitable foundation and fundraising golf tournament named in honor of his younger brother, Jon Willingham, who died in a car accident in 2009.
On June 9, 2021, Willingham was announced as the head coach at his high school alma mater, Mars Hill Bible School in Florence, AL.

The Book of Learning and Forgetting () is a 1998 book in which author Frank Smith investigates the history of learning theories and the events that shaped our current educational structure.
Smith distinguishes between the "classical" and the "official" theories of learning. The classical view holds that people are constantly and effortlessly learning through immersion in a social community and its practices, and that this process of learning is universal. The official view suggests that learning requires effort, and that it only occurs when a student is being presented with the information. Standardized testing is closely associated with the official view.
Smith details the way in which the official view has gained acceptance despite its many negative results.

Synodontis is the largest genus of mochokid catfishes. It is the biggest genus within the 10 genera and 190 different species in the family Mochokidae. Synodontis has over 131 different species within the genus. Synodontis are also known as squeakers, due to their ability to make stridulatory sounds through their pectoral fin spines when handled or disturbed. Synodontis make a sound that sounds like squeaking by rubbing their spines together. They do this when they have been frightened or when they become angry. Synodontis may also squeak when they are taken out of the water. These catfish are small- to medium-sized fish with many species exhibiting attractive spotted markings. Some species are also known for naturally swimming belly-up, earning the name upside-down catfish. Some of these species are Synodontis contractus and Synodontis nigriventris. While some of these species are known to swim upside down, another species, Synodontis multipunctatus, is a brood parasitic cuckoo catfish.
Distribution
Synodontis is a freshwater catfish that is most commonly found throughout Africa, occurring mostly in Central and West Africa. Synodontis is the most widely distributed mochokidae genus, occurring throughout most of the freshwaters of sub-Saharan Africa and the Nile River system. They can live in freshwaters which can be creeks, ponds, streams, lakes, and rivers. Their distribution is similar to that of cichlid fishes, however, unlike cichlids the majority of their diversity occurs in rivers not lakes.
Evolutionary history
Synodontis catfish form a small endemic radiation in Lake Tanganyika, which includes the non-endemic species S. victoriae. This radiation is thought to have evolved relatively recently (~5.5. A Million years ago), having diversified within full lacustrine conditions. This is also the case for other endemic Lake Tanganyika lineages such as mastacembelid eels and platythelphusid crabs for example. Lake Tanganyikan Synodontis have also been shown to be Müllerian mimics, and that at least one species (Synodontis multipunctatus) is a brood parasite.
Fossil record
The earliest fossils of Synodontis in East African are from the Early Miocene. Many Synodontis fossils are the spines because they are very sturdy and so they are preserved better. The fossils of spines that are found are used to determine the family or genera of the fish but it cannot determine the species. Synodontis species that have survived and are still living can be identified by the shape of their whisker like organs on their heads called barbels, which relate to touch. The can also be identified by the color of their skin, the skull bones, and the number and length of the teeth.
Ecology
Synodontis species are omnivorous generalists, feeding on a wide spectrum of different foods and are largely unspecialized. Insects, crustaceans, mollusks, annelids, seeds, and algae have been found in the stomachs of different species of Synodontis. They are bottom-feeders and may be detritivores, some species may also be able to adapt to filter feeding. This allows them to cope with seasonal and habitat changes and gives them a better ability to colonize different habitats. Different Synodontis species have somewhat different growth rates but most of them are fairly similar. Females of a species are generally larger than the males. There is a great increase in growth the first year in both male and female and then the growth slows down as they become older. The form and structure of these fish are very different compared to other fish. The size and shape of the mouth are distinct because of its ventral mouth and these fish usually are triangular or cylindrical when looking at it from the side. Not much is known about the reproduction in these fish. It has been determined that July to October is when they spawn and that they swim in pairs during this spawning time. Species of Synodontis have been noted to reproduce with the flooding period of the rainy season.
Relationship to humans
Many Synodontis species are prized ornamental fish in the fishkeeping hobby. While some of the Synodontis species are prized because of their color or behavior, other species are wanted for food. Some of the bigger species in the genus are important food sources for the people in Africa.
Species
There are currently 131 recognized species in this genus: Synodontis accounts for about one-quarter of African catfish species. This genus has more members than any other African teleost genus other than Barbus and Haplochromis.
Newer species are listed with references.

Pleurotus purpureo-olivaceus is a gilled fungus native to Australia and New Zealand. It is found on dead wood of Nothofagus trees. Although morphologically similar to some other Pleurotus fungi, it has been shown to be a distinct species incapable of cross-breeding and phylogenetically removed from other species of Pleurotus.
The caps of the fruit bodies are up to wide, and are dark violet to brown to olive to yellow-green, depending on light exposure. Stipes are lateral and white to yellow.

Plot
Lide, a young mother, works as a security guard for an engineering project that has part of her community up in arms. This drama pales into comparison when, one day, she gets up to find that her daughter Ane is not in the house, nor has her bed been slept in.
Neither the film's characters nor the viewer sees Ane and the heightened tension in the community seems to magnify the void she has left behind. As Lide turns to her ex-partner Fernando (Mikel Losada), Ane's father, for help, it becomes apparent that she is somehow afraid of this unseen daughter.

Sleights of Mind: What the Neuroscience of Magic Reveals about Our Everyday Deceptions is a 2010 popular science book, written by neuroscientists Stephen Macknik and Susana Martinez-Conde, with science writer Sandra Blakeslee. Working alongside some of the world's greatest magicians, Macknik and Martinez-Conde studied how conjuring techniques trick the brain. Sleights of Mind considers the greater implications of magic and misdirection for clinical conditions such as autism, and for everyday life situations, including choice and trust in personal and business relationships.
Sleights of Mind is the result of Macknik and Martinez-Conde's yearlong, world-wide exploration of magic and how its principles apply to human behavior. Sleights of Mind introduces Neuromagic as a new area of scientific endeavor, a discipline aimed to uncover the interaction between brain science and the art of magic. Macknik and Martinez-Conde propose that understanding how the mind perceives magic and illusion will provide a greater understanding of perception and cognition at large.
Synopsis
Macknik and Martinez-Conde say that magic tricks fool us because humans have hardwired processes of attention and awareness that are hackable. Good magicians use our inherent mental and neural limitations against us by leading us to perceive and feel what we are neurologically inclined to. Working with renowned magicians like Apollo Robbins, Teller, Mac King, and James Randi, Macknik and Martinez-Conde research the ways in which the perceptual and cognitive elements of magic relate to more than simple deceits. The authors reveal the neural underpinnings of the magical methods that explain how our brains perceive magic.
Through their exploration, Macknik and Martinez-Conde uncover how our brains work in everyday situations. They describe how if you have ever bought an expensive item you had sworn you would never buy, the salesperson was creating the “illusion of choice,” a core technique of magic. They also relate the use of magic to Bernie Madoff's “illusion of trust”. Through these examples, Macknik's and Martinez-Conde's Sleights of Mind illuminates the reasons for studying magic, and its implications for research on, and renewed understanding of, perceptual and cognitive processes.

Bhalji adopted both of them, a boy (Jayasingh) and a girl. The girl later married novelist Ranjit Desai and she is better known as Madhavi Desai (died in 2013); she wrote the book 'Naacha Ga Ghumaa'. His second daughter's name was Saroj Chindarkar.
Bhalji's son with his first wife, Prabhakar Pendharkar (1933–2010), was associated with making of Do Aankhen Barah Haath in the 1950s, wrote the book रारंगढांग, and was author-director of noteworthy documentaries. Bhalji named his studio Jayaprabha, combining in it the names of Leela's son Jayasingh (whom Bhalji had adopted) and his own son Prabhakar.
Film career
Bhalji started his career in the era of silent films. He was associated with Prabhat Film Company's earliest talkies, and also worked with other studios in hometown of Kolhapur. Later he acquired his own studio in form of Jayprabha Studio and became a film producer and director. He also wrote lyrics for some film songs in Marathi. His more famous films are: Netaji Palkar, Thoratanchi Kamala, Chhatrapati Shivaji, Mohityanchi Manjula, Maratha Titutka Melvava, Sadhi Manse, Tambdi Maati. Hindi: Maharathi Karna, Valimi, Chhatrapati Shivaji.Ganimi Kawa

This article lists the respective singles champions of those events since the inception of the ATP Tour in 1990.
Note: By setting 1990 as the cut-off point, this list excludes many notable champions in top level tournaments from previous years. The Grand Slam tournaments and the Year-end Championship have been held since 1877 and 1970 respectively. The Olympics was first played in 1896 until 1924. High category tournaments equivalent to the Masters Series like the Grand Prix Super Series existed before the ATP Tour was introduced. There were also the professional Majors, the World Championship Series and the amateur Majors (WHCC, WCCC) before the Open Era.

The Itqiy meteorite is an enstatite-rich stony-iron meteorite. It is classified as an enstatite chondrite of the EH group that was nearly melted and is therefore very unusual for that group. Other classifications have been proposed and are an ongoing scientific debate.
History
Itqiy was initially attributed to a 1990 fireball in Western Sahara. One stone was recovered by a nomad, and a second stone was recovered in July 2000 by Marc, Luc, and Jim Labenne who were searching for meteorites in the same location. The meteorite was analyzed in 2001. Later work showed that the meteorite had fallen nearly 6,000 years ago and was not associated with any recent fireball.
Mineralogy and petrology
Itqiy is a stony meteorite consisting of 78% enstatite and 22% meteoric iron. The meteoric iron is kamacite with 5.77% nickel. Small amounts of other minerals include troilite, Mg-Mn-Fe sulfides and Fe-Cr sulfides.
Classification
The meteorite was described as an "ungrouped stony meteorite" in 2000, and reclassified as an "ungrouped enstatite meteorite" in 2001. In 2006, Itqiy was classified as a member of the EH enstatite chondrites, with a petrologic type of 7, emphasizing that it was a strongly metamorphosed EH chondrite.
Itqiy represents a rock that formed through partial melting of an EH chondrite. This process removed the more volatile minerals like plagioclase.
In 2010-1 it was proposed that Itqiy, QUE 94204, QUE 97289, QUE 97348, NWA 2526 and possibly Yamato 793225 form a new group from the same parent body that should be called "primitive enstatite achondrites".

Harrison Daniel Packard (1838 – 13 November 1874) was a surveyor in the early days of the colony of South Australia. He served at Escape Cliffs under B. T. Finniss, and later under G. W. Goyder at Port Darwin.
History
Packard was a son Rev. Daniel Packard (c. 1810 – 12 May 1862) MA (Caius College, Cambridge), rector of Middleton, Suffolk who had been appointed to St Andrew's Anglican Church, Walkerville and his wife Sarah née Devereux (1814 – 9 March 1886) married in December 1835.
They arrived in South Australia by ship Asia in September 1851, accompanied by their large family: G. A., Sarah Jane, Harrison D., Emily, Francis, A. E., Frederick, John, Alice, and Charles.
Packard joined the South Australian Survey Department in 1855.
In 1864 he was appointed second in command of the "Relief Party" sent to Escape Cliffs at the mouth of the Adelaide River, Northern Territory, to augment Colonel Finniss's expedition, which had been sent there to select and survey the site of a future settlement to be called Palmerston.
The original expedition under Finniss had not proceeded smoothly; little was accomplished due to the inhospitable site and incursions by marauding tribesmen; several men died, and two Aboriginal men were shot dead. The camp was split by jealousies and many left rather than face another wet season.
Packard and his wife, with their baby daughter only a few weeks old, left Port Adelaide on October 1864 for Escape Cliffs, where they remained until the expedition was recalled, somewhat over two years.
On 21 December 1866 his wife gave birth to their second child, Eleanor Devereux Packard, remembered as the first European born in the Northern Territory.
In 1868 he was appointed to the expedition to Port Darwin, under the Surveyor-General G. W. Goyder, and a year later his wife joined him.
In 1870 he was appointed cadet Surveyor and a few years later he was acting Surveyor of the Northern Territory
His wife remained in Darwin until overcome by sickness and disease, she returned home in July 1874.
Packard would have accompanied her could he have obtained leave of absence, but was forced to remain, the two maintaining contact via telegraph.
Packard died in Palmerston Hospital from an ulcerated throat, and was buried that same afternoon.
Recognition
Mount Packard in the Victoria-Daly Shire was named for him by G. G. McLachlan.
Packard Place and Packard Street in Darwin were "named after R. D. Packard, a Surveyor Cadet in A H Smith's No. 3 party with G W Goyder's Expedition of 1869"
This may derive from a newspaper misprint later corrected to H. D. Packard.
Packards Knob (and hence Packard Avenue in Palmerston City) "commemorates Harrison D. Packard, who was one of George W Goyder's cadet surveyors during his 1869 survey expedition"
Packards Rivulet at Koolpinyah "was named by "Fred Litchfield . . . after his colleague, surveyor A. D. Packard, on 15 September 1865 during the Escape Cliffs survey 1864-66."
This can only be a misprint for H. D. Packard.
Family
Rev. Daniel Packard (c. 1810 – 12 May 1862) married Sarah Devereux (1814 – 9 March 1886) in December 1835, emigrated to South Australia 1851. Their children were:

The first USS Hamilton was a United States Navy schooner which served on Lake Ontario from 1812 to 1813 during the War of 1812.
Hamilton was built at Oswego, New York, as the merchant ship Diana in 1809 for the merchant Matthew McNair. On 21 October 1812, the U.S. Navy purchased Diana for use on Lake Ontario. Diana was based at Sackets Harbor, New York. Her name was changed to USS Hamilton on 5 November 1812, in honor of the United States Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton (1762–1816).
Hamilton was not a large or specialized warship; instead, she was a simple ship that was pressed into U.S. Navy service. With the conversion of Hamilton to a man-of-war problems came up such as the decks not being strong enough to carry naval guns and the bulwarks not being high enough to provide enough protection for the gun crews. Nonetheless, the 76 tons burthen Hamilton was armed with eight 12-pounder carronades and one swiveling 24-or 32-pounder "Long Tom" cannon mounted amidships.
Hamilton, under the command of a Lieutenant Walter Winter, and the schooner sank during a sudden squall off Fourteen Mile Creek near present-day Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, around 2:00 a.m. on 8 August 1813. Sixteen men survived from the two ships, but the sinkings took more than 80 men to their deaths. Ned Myers, a survivor of Scourge, told his story to James Fenimore Cooper; according to Myers, about eight men from Hamilton were saved and about 42 were lost.
The site of the sunken ships was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1976. The Ontario Heritage Act was amended in 2005 to provide special protection to the wrecks of Hamilton and Scourge because of their historical and cultural significance and because they contain human remains.

Cursor*10 (pronounced "cursor times ten") is a web-based browser game developed by the Japanese company Nekogames and designed by Yoshio Ishii. The game is Flash-based
Development
The game was inspired by the Flash-based browser game Finger Tracks made by Yugo Nakamura. It was developed by Yoshio Ishii over a single Japanese New Year's Holiday.
Gameplay
The player must guide a cursor through a series of obstacles. Previous attempts are replayed as the player re-attempts each level and in some cases the player must attempt the level more than once with the assistance of their previous attempt. This means that the player is assisted by and interacts with the "ghost" of their previous self in their previous attempt. The game is thus a "one player co-op" game.
An example of a task where the player must attempt the level more than once is a level where the player must click on a box 99 times within a specific time where the time is short enough to make the task impossible in a single attempt. Another example is a level where the player has to click on a plate to disclose a staircase where the plate is located so as to make the staircase unreachable from the plate.
Reception
The game has been praised for its novel design. It was included in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die, though the book described it as "more a proof of concept than the finished work". Writing for Rock Paper Shotgun, John Walker praised the game's one-player co-op design, calling it "The best possible form of co-op". Writing for the Austin Chronicle, James Renovitch described the game as "A focus on innovative play and a unique artistic style".
The game has been credited with popularising the "self-co-op" style of gameplay. A sequel called Cursor*10 2nd Session was subsequently released.
A greatly updated version of the game ported over to PlayStation Portable platform called (in Japanese) Onore no Shinzuru Michi wo Yuke developed by Silicon Studio was released in Japan by publishers From Software.

The brown jacamar (Brachygalba lugubris) is a species of bird in the family Galbulidae. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela.
Taxonomy and systematics
The brown jacamar and the dusky-backed (B. salmoni), pale-headed (B. goeringi), and white-throated jacamars (B. albogularis) form a superspecies. The brown jacamar has seven subspecies:
B. l. fulviventris Sclater (1891)
B. l. caquetae Chapman (1917)
B. l. lugubris Swainson (1838)
B. l. obscuriceps Zimmer & Phelps (1947)
B. l. naumburgae Chapman (1931)
B. l. phaeonota Todd (1943)
B. l. melanosterna Sclater (1855)
Three of them (fulviventris, phaeonota, and melanosterna) were at one time treated as separate species.
Description
The brown jacamar is long and weighs . The upper parts of the nominate are brown and the lower back dark brown with a greenish black gloss. The wings are blackish with a blue sheen. The chin and throat are off-white, the breast and flanks reddish brown, and the lower breast and belly off-white or buff. The other subspecies differ in the tone and intensity of the back and breast colors.
Distribution and habitat
The brown jacamar is found in three unconnected areas in northern South America east of the Andes. The details are:
B. l. fulviventris, central Colombia's Meta and Boyacá Departments
B. l. caquetae, from Colombia's Caquetá Department south to eastern Ecuador and northern Peru
B. l. lugubris, eastern and southern Venezuela east through the Guianas and northern Brazil
B. l. obscuriceps, southern Venezuela and adjoining northwestern Brazil
B. l. naumburgae, northeastern Brazil's Maranhão and Piauí states
B. l. phaeonota, Brazil, along Rio Solimões (upper Amazon River) in western Amazonas state
B. l. melanosterna, Bolivia's Santa Cruz Department and central and southern Brazil
The brown jacamar primarily inhabits terra firme, várzea, and gallery forests, both primary and secondary. There it is found in the canopy, along edges, and in shrubby clearings. It is also found along watercourses in savanna and, in some parts of its range, on white sand soils. In elevation it usually ranges from lowlands to but has been found as high as in Venezuela.
Behavior
Feeding
The brown jacamar's diet is insects of many kinds. It perches on exposed branches in pairs or small groups and sallies from there to catch its flying prey.
Breeding
The brown jacamar's nest has not been documented, but it is assumed to be a burrow in a soil bank or an arboreal termite nest. In Colombia, a family with three young was noted in March and other individuals in breeding condition in May.
Vocalization
The brown jacamar's song is a "descending 'tick tick tick ti ti tit t t t' or 'plee, plee, plee-plee-plee'ple'pe'pe'e'e'e" ending in a stutter . Its calls are a sharp "hilew" or lower "chewee" .
Status
The IUCN has assessed the brown jacamar as being of The Least Concern. It is uncommon to common at various parts of its range, occurs in several protected areas, and "its habitat requirements suggest that selective logging would not be a threat." However, subspecies B. l. phaeonota is known only in a very small area, and so "requires further study to clarify its conservation status and range."

The Yankee motorcycle is a motorcycle which was produced in Schenectady, New York by the Yankee Motor Company in the 1970s. This company was started by John Taylor, a long-time resident of that area.
The motorcycle used an air-cooled two-stroke engine, designed by Eduard Giró that was produced by the Ossa firm in Barcelona, Spain. The engine was a unique combination of two Ossa cylinders, that produced a twin-cylinder engine of near 500 cc capacity. The Yankee frame, designed with help from Dick Mann, and running gear were produced in the US, and the entire motorcycle was assembled in the Yankee plant on Campbell Avenue in Schenectady.

On 27 October 2013, a series of bomb blasts rocked the Indian city of Patna, Bihar at a massive election rally for BJP Prime Ministerial candidate and current Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Of the estimated 300,000 participants at the "Hunkar" rally, six people were killed and 85 others were injured in eight bomb blasts.
No one initially claimed responsibility for the bombings. In 2021, terrorists from the Indian Mujahideen, which had been the first suspects, and Students' Islamic Movement of India were convicted for carrying out the attacks.
Bombings
On the morning of 27 October 2013, the first bomb exploded at Patna Junction railway station at around 10:00 , while two unexploded bombs were recovered by bomb disposal personnel. The second bomb exploded at 12:10, while the third bomb exploded at 12:25, both near Gandhi Maidan, where the Bharatiya Janata Party's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi was supposed to hold a rally in the lead-up to the 2014 Indian general election a couple of hours later. There were five other blasts from which three bombs exploded in and out of the Gandhi Maidan area, one exploded near a cinema hall and another close to the Twin Tower building complex in Patna.
The chronology of the bombings were:
09:30 Public Toilet
11:40 near Udyog Bhawan
12:05 near eastern side of Regent Cinema
12:10 near Mahatma Gandhi Statue at Gandhi Maidan
12:15 near Twin Towers of southern periphery of Gandhi Maidan
12:20 near State Bank of India (western Gandhi Maidan)
12:25 near Children's Park (North-western side)
13:35 Modi started his speech.
17:15 inside Gandhi Maidan
Railway station
A crude bomb exploded on an isolated place on platform 10 of Patna Junction railway station. One person who sustained injuries in this blast died. According to Railway Protection Force, the explosion took place at a paid toilet within the station. Two more homemade bombs were defused. According to Union Home Ministry, one of the two crude bombs placed had a timer attached to it.
Gandhi Maidan
Later that day, five more low intensity blasts took place in Gandhi Maidan, where the pre-election rally of Narendra Modi was taking place. Several people were injured in these blasts. One more blast took place in Elphinstine Cinema near the Gandhi Maidan, injuring six people. One more unexploded bomb was found below the dais where Narendra Modi had spoken in the rally, which has been defused. However, it was not confirmed how only a single bomb didn't explode while others did. The eighth bomb exploded around 5 PM on the same day, which was believed to be hidden under garbage. The attackers are still unknown.
Reactions
Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh condemned the blasts and spoke to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar asking him to hasten a probe into the incidents. The Union Home Ministry sent NIA and NSG teams to the blast sites for investigate. Union Minister of State for Home Affairs R. P. N. Singh assured the Bihar government that the union government would provide all assistance in investigating the blast incident. For his part, Kumar condemned the blasts and said that his government had provided full security for the rally. He also revealed that a suspicious suitcase was found in Gandhi Maidan two days previously and henceforth security would be beefed up. He also cancelled his scheduled trip of Munger and convened a meeting on the law and order situation. Narendra Modi expressed his condolences for the bomb blast victims online. A week after the blast, Modi returned to Bihar to offer condolences and Rs. 500,000 to the families of the six people killed in the attack. Dense fog allowed him to visit only three families while the other three were contacted over the phone.
Former Deputy CM of Bihar Sushil Kumar Modi called it a deliberate administrative failure and criminal negligence and wrong on Twitter: "When I saw 3 blast in gandhi Maidan,I ranged DGP Bihar.he said that truck tyre has burst."
An Indian National Congress leader, Shakeel Ahmad, wrote: "Blasts during Modi Ji's 1st visit as PM hopeful to Bihar should be condemned by one and all. State govt and NIA should unearth the conspiracy." INC General Secretary Digvijaya Singh said: "What a coincidence blast at Patna Railway on the day of Modi's Rally ! Challenge to Nitish Govt to find the culprit !."
Jamaat-e-Islami Hind General Secretary Nusrat Ali called for strong action against those who carried out the attacks.
Hours after the attacks Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde was spotted at the music launch party of Bollywood movie Rajjo along with Kangana Ranaut. Several political parties, including the national Bharatiya Janata Party and Communist Party of India criticised his presence immediately after the blasts.
Investigation
Within days of the blasts, the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar requested Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde to have the National Investigation Agency (NIA) take over the case. As terrorists were planting the bombs at Patna Junction railway station, one of the bombs prematurely exploded due to a wiring error. One of the suspects planting the bomb, Tarique alias Ainul was critically injured in the blast and died a few days later. Patna police converged on the scene of the blast and apprehended Imtiaz Ansari as he was attempting to flee in possession of explosives. Interrogation of Imtiaz Ansari revealed that the bombings were coordinated by Indian Mujahideen, a Pakistani-linked Muslim terrorist group operating out of India. Ansari confessed that the goal was to ring the rally ground with bombs and cause stampede during the rally to kill as many of the participants, particularly women and children, as possible. However, as the blasts went off, BJP officials organising the rally led the crowd to believe they were fire crackers and appealed for calm, thus averting a much greater loss of life and foiling the Indian Mujahideen's plans of inciting a deadly stampede that could have killed hundreds. In the initial days of the investigation, six suspects were detained for interrogation based on leads obtained by police from Imtiaz Ansari.
Investigators believe Mohammad Tehsin Akhtar alias Monu to be the mastermind behind the serial blasts, and the second-highest ranking leader of the terrorist outfit, Indian Mujahideen. Tehsin had been radicalized at a madrasa in Chikmagalur, Karnataka in 2005 and has moved up the ranks in the terrorist group since then. After the blasts, the terrorist mastermind Tehsin Akhtar was revealed by news media as the nephew of Taqui Akhtar, a leader of the Janata Dal (United), party which is currently in power in Bihar led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. Taqui publicly disowned his nephew after reports of his involvement in the serial blasts arose in the media.
The Gujarat Director General of Police lambasted the Bihar government for lack of cooperation and a lax approach to security for the rally despite receiving general intelligence inputs from the Intelligence Bureau (IB) of possible blasts during Modi's rally. He said that basic procedures mandatory for all public meetings, such as anti-sabotage checks and pre-event drills were not carried out by the Bihar Police despite requests made by Gujarat Police officials. BJP leaders, including former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister, Sushil Kumar Modi, asserted that the security lapses were a deliberate, possibly criminal attempt by the Bihar Chief Minister, Nitish Kumar, to take revenge on his political enemy, Narendra Modi. Nitish Kumar rejected this charge saying that he had directed police to make all necessary security arrangements for the event.
On 5 November 2013, a tip-off in tracking one of the suspected masterminds of the blasts led the National Intelligence Agency to a small hotel in Ranchi, Jharkhand, 350 kilometers from Patna, where they discovered 9 live bombs just like those used in the Patna blasts. Police suspect that the Patna bomb blast suspects have been staying at this hotel. By April 2014, NIA had arrested eight suspects for their alleged involvement in the explosions.

Oglethorpe County is a county located in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Georgia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 14,899. The county seat is Lexington.
Oglethorpe County is included in the Athens-Clarke County, GA Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Atlanta-Athens-Clarke County-Sandy Springs, GA Combined Statistical Area. It is the largest county in Northeast Georgia.
History
Oglethorpe County was originally part of a large tract of land surrendered by Creek and Cherokee Native Americans to the Colony of Georgia in the treaty of 1773. The county itself was founded on December 19, 1793, and is named for Georgia's founder, General James Oglethorpe.
On September 10, 1919, Obe Cox was accused of murdering a White farmer's wife. He was seized by a White mob taken to the scene of the crime, his body riddled with bullets and burned at the stake. Several thousand persons witnessed the scene. The lynching was controversial as the local black community "thanked" the mob for just killing Cox and not attacking their community. After an investigation the black media of the time reported that the blacks who wrote the letter thanking the lynching "do not stand for much in the town and are excused for their utter ignorance in condoning [lynching]."

That Face is a two-act play written by Polly Stenham. It premiered at the Royal Court Theatre in London on 26 April 2007, directed by Jeremy Herrin. The play was revived at the Duke of York's Theatre in the West End in 2008, opening on 1 May. It made its American premiere in May 2010, at the Manhattan Theatre Club, running through until 27 June.
Plot
Mia is at boarding school and has access to her mother's drugs. She gets into trouble for drugging a fellow student and this causes her father to be brought back to England from Hong Kong. Henry, her brother, has dropped out of school and has to stay at home and look after his alcoholic mother. Martha, their fading glamorous mother, controls their lives whilst her own sick mind and world crumble around her.
Original West End production
When That Face premiered on the West End, the cast was as follows: Lindsay Duncan, Hannah Murray, Matt Smith, Catherine Steadman and Julian Wadham. Prior to the West End transfer, Felicity Jones played the Hannah Murray role.
2010 New York production
The Manhattan Theatre Club mounted the play on its Stage I in May 2010, with Cristin Milioti and Christopher Abbott portraying the siblings, and Laila Robins as the mother.
Landor Theatre
That Face received its first London revival at The Landor Theatre from 12 November to 1 December 2013, starring Caroline Wildi as Martha, Rory Fleck-Byrne as Henry, Stephanie Hyam as Mia and Georgina Leonidas as Izzy.
Critical reaction
That Face was received positively by critics, who particularly praised the new writer and the performances from the actors. Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph said it was "a blazing, no-holds barred production… Fresh, passionate and blackly comic – exhilarating... Lindsay Duncan's superb performance...Matt Smith is outstanding.". The Daily Express mentioned that "Polly Stenham is a modern successor to Tennessee Williams or Edward Albee... Intensely moving, skillfully crafted piece." The Daily Express, The Evening Standard, The Guardian, The Times, Time Out, Metro, Radio 4 and The Sunday Times also reviewed it very positively. In late 2009, the play was named at no. 9 in The Times Top Twenty Plays of the Decade. It also received three Olivier Award nominations (one in 2008, before the transfer, then nods for Best New Play and Best Actress in a Play in 2009).

The Mount Pulaski Courthouse State Historic Site is a historic county courthouse located in Mount Pulaski, Illinois, United States. It was the county seat of Logan County from 1848 until 1855. It is one of only two remaining courthouses from Illinois's Eighth Circuit, the circuit on which central Illinois lawyer Abraham Lincoln carried out much of his practice of law. The courthouse is operated by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency as a state historic site. Visitors are given guided tours of the recreated county offices and courtroom.
1848-1855: courthouse
Prior to 1848, the people of Logan County used a frame courthouse, now the Postville Courthouse State Historic Site, located close to the center of the county at Postville. Frame courthouses were especially vulnerable to fire, and county leaders began looking for a community that would subsidize the construction of a masonry structure. Mount Pulaski citizens combined to contribute $2,700 toward the $3,000 for a new structure. This two-story brick building stands today as the Mount Pulaski Courthouse. The Greek Revival building features pediments spanning the length of the building and pilasters at each corner.
When the new courthouse was built in 1848, Abraham Lincoln of nearby Springfield was representing central Illinois in the U.S. House of Representatives. Returning to Illinois in 1849, he resumed the practice of law in the Eighth Circuit, and often visited the Mount Pulaski courthouse. Mount Pulaski is located 25 miles (40 km) north of Springfield, a day's journey by the horse and light buggy that Lincoln used.
Mount Pulaski is located in the southeastern quarter of Logan County. In the early 1850s, developers built a railroad, which would become the Chicago and Alton Railroad, northeastward from Springfield through Logan County. The new railroad became the focus of county development, and it did not go near Mount Pulaski. The railroad and county leaders agreed to move the Logan County seat once again, to a location very near the center of the county and directly on the new railroad line. The new county seat was named Lincoln, Illinois, after lawyer Lincoln, who by this time had made many friends throughout the county. The decision was affirmed by county voters in a referendum in 1853, and the court and county government had moved away by 1855.
County leaders' fear of fire proved to be well-founded in 1857, when a blaze destroyed the relocated county records, including the dockets of the Logan County circuit court. As a result, very little is known of Lincoln's specific legal cases in Logan County during the Mount Pulaski interval.
After 1855
Mount Pulaski only served as the county seat until 1853, when it moved to Lincoln, so the courthouse only served in its intended capacity for five years. After 1853, the building served as a school, the Mount Pulaski city hall and jail, and the local post office.
Illinois Governor Henry Horner launched a statewide search in the 1930s for surviving public buildings with which Lincoln had been familiar. Mount Pulaski gave the old brick courthouse building to the state of Illinois in 1936, and the state extensively restored it in 1936–1939 to resemble its function as the county courthouse.
The courthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 3, 1978, qualifying both because of its place in local history and because of its historically significant architecture. According to a member of the Logan County planning commission at the time, the building "ranks among the finest and best-preserved pre-1850 buildings in the state."

The Kraków Philharmonic () is the primary concert hall in Kraków, Poland. It is one of the largest auditoriums in the city. It consists of the main hall for orchestral performances with 693 seats, and two smaller venues, the Golden Hall and the Blue Hall, for chamber music concerts.
Construction
The Kraków Philharmonic Concert Hall was designed by architect Józef Pokutynski, with neo-baroque elements inspired by the Brussels' Maison du Peuple. It was sponsored by Prince and Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha, and completed 1931. In 1996, a new 50-pipe organ was installed in the hall, replacing an older one by Karl Schuke. It was designed and built by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn, a family-run company specializing in large-scale projects across the globe. The concert hall is home of the Kraków Philharmonic Orchestra as well as the chamber Capella Cracoviensis.
History
The first serious attempts to create a resident symphony orchestra in the city go back to the 18th century. The professional team was assembled only in 1909 under the management of composer Feliks Nowowiejski (b. 1877). Since its creation under the foreign Partitions of Poland, and throughout the interwar period, the Kraków Philharmonic maintained also the Polish Professional Musicians Trade Union for performers who worked around the city, including in cafés and in the silent movie theatres. The Union's goal was to protect the welfare of its members as well as the artistic level of their performances. Its main contribution to the local music culture was the organising of symphony concerts. The Philharmonic orchestra performed regularly until the Invasion of Poland in September 1939.
During the occupation of Poland on the order of Hans Frank, the Nazi Governor of the semi-colonial General Government set up in Kraków, a new Nur für Deutsche orchestra was formed in July 1940 under Gestapo chief Bruno Müller. It was called the General Government Symphony Orchestra.
The Symphony Orchestra now residing in the Kraków Philharmonic began in February 1945. It was the first professional symphony orchestra in postwar Poland, under Professor Zygmunt Latoszewski.
Principal conductors and Music Directors of Kraków Philharmonic in the past include Witold Rowicki, Prof. Krzysztof Penderecki, Gilbert Levine (1987–1993), Roland Bader of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Paweł Przytocki (March 2009 - September 2012) (Managing Director and Artistic Director) and many other renowned artists.
Soloists

James Healey Willan (12 October 1880 – 16 February 1968) was an Anglo-Canadian organist and composer. He composed more than 800 works including operas, symphonies, chamber music, a concerto, and pieces for band, orchestra, organ, and piano. He is best known for his church music.
Biography
Willan was born in England on 12 October 1880 and began musical training at age eight, with studies at St. Saviour's Choir School in Eastbourne. He continued at St. Saviour's until 1895, when he began working as organist and choirmaster at several London-area churches. He earned, by examination in organ playing, harmony, counterpoint, history and orchestration, the ARCO in 1897 and fellowship in 1899. From 1903 to 1913, he was organist and choirmaster of St. John the Baptist Church on Holland Road in London. The Anglo-Catholic Tractarian movement had led to an Anglican revival of plainsong, and in 1910 Willan joined the London Gregorian Association (which strove to preserve and revive "plain-chant"). In 1913 Willan emigrated to Canada.
Willan became organist-choirmaster of Toronto's largest church, St. Paul's, Bloor Street, whose rector, Canon Cody, was later to become Ontario provincial education minister and the chancellor of the University of Toronto. In 1914, Willan was appointed a lecturer and examiner in music at the university. His royalties as a church music composer allowed him to leave "low church" St. Paul's in 1921 and to become precentor of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene (Toronto). He remained there until his death. St. Mary Magdalene's, under Willan, became a North American mecca for choral and Anglican church musicians. In 1934 he founded the Tudor Singers, which he conducted until it disbanded in 1939.
In 1920 the Toronto Conservatory (since 1947 the Royal Conservatory of Music) appointed Willan as head of its theory department. Later he became vice-principal. The conservatory was part of the University of Toronto. Students from the conservatory could become eligible to complete the music degree examinations administered by the university. From 1937 to 1950, Willan was University of Toronto Professor of Music and Organist and responsible for the music degree examinations.
His notable pupils included pianist Howard Brown, tenor Gordon Wry, and composers Cecil Gray, Patricia Blomfield Holt, Walter MacNutt, F. R. C. Clarke, Phyllis Gummer and Kenneth Peacock.
When the Order of Canada was established in 1967, it named Willan a Companion. In Britain, it was customary for the Archbishop of Canterbury to occasionally grant very distinguished English cathedral musicians the Lambeth Doctorate, Mus. D Cantuar; in 1956 Willan, "the Dean of Canadian composers" became the first non-English church musician to be so honoured; subsequently, many Canadian universities followed suit. Willan was one of the first Canadian musicians to appear on a Canadian postage stamp. It was not lost on young Canadian musicians that Willan was able to make his livelihood as a composer, and that being a composer was something to which they might realistically aspire.
Willan, who would describe his provenance "English by birth; Canadian by adoption; Irish by extraction; Scotch by absorption", died on 16 February 1968 in Toronto. The park immediately to the east of St. Mary Magdalene church was named in his honour.
Compositions
While serving as the organist and choirmaster at St. Paul's, Bloor Street, Willan became interested in the music of another Anglican parish, that of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene. St. Paul's was an evangelical, low church; St. Mary Magdalene's, while much smaller, was notably high church or Anglo-Catholic. By 1920, Willan was assisting with choir practice. In 1921, he resigned his post at St. Paul's and turned his attention to St. Mary Magdalene's. He set about creating a great many liturgical works for use in the church's services and on creating one of the few choirs in North America with expertise in singing unaccompanied music to a very high standard. He remained at St. Mary Magdalene's until shortly before his death, last directing the choir in 1967.
Willan composed some 800 musical pieces, the majority sacred works for choir such as anthems, hymns and mass settings. His non-sacred opus includes some 50 choral works, 100 song arrangements for voice with piano accompaniment, many works for piano solo, for voice with instrumental accompaniment, two symphonies, a piano concerto, chamber works, incidental music for stage works, ballad operas, and at least one important opera (Deirdre). His Introduction, Passacaglia and Fugue was inspired by the Max Reger piece of the same name. A 1964 EMI recording by Francis Jackson helped bring the piece into the mainstream repertoire.
In 1953, Willan received a commission to write an anthem for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The resulting anthem, O Lord Our Governour, continues to be frequently performed. Willan's friends clubbed together to pay for his fare to London, so that he could attend the ceremony in person.
Willan is best known for his sacred choral and organ works, which show evidence of his love for plainsong and Renaissance music. For example, many of his liturgical compositions employ western church modes from a thousand years ago and the modality and harmony of late nineteenth-century Russian Orthodox choral music. His vocal lines are significantly more melismatic, his style more contrapuntal and rhythmically much freer than was the case in the liturgical music of his contemporaries. The lively acoustics at Saint Mary Magdalene allowed the melismatic lines to soar and yet linger at the same time. His larger choral works, however, were very Romantic in nature. His rich harmonic palette and luxuriant, soaring melodies stand as testament to his admiration of both Brahms and Wagner.
His music represents a unique and beautiful combination of styles: both an homage to the sacred music of five centuries ago and a reflection of the innovations of the Romantic/post-Romantic period in which he lived.
Works
A fairly comprehensive listing of his works is given at the International Music Score Library Project. The Giles Bryant Healey Willan Catalogue assigns numbers to (some of) Willan's works, eg B314, Rise up, my love, my fair one.

Katherine Woodthorpe or Katherine Lesley Woodthorpe is an Australian Chair and Company Director, a fellow of the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering, and of the Australian Institute of Company Directors. She has also been chair of the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Bushfire and Natural Hazards, chair of Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems CRC, as well as Chair of National Climate Science Advisory Committee.
Early life and career
Woodthorpe was born in Malaysia and grew up in Hong Kong. She obtained a honours degree in chemistry, at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, then a PhD in chemistry from the University of Leicester. She worked in Western Australia, and then Europe, as well as selling medical products in Western Australia. She was employed in her role in Western Australia during a time when women were 'discriminated against', and not allowed to work underground nor drink with their colleagues. She has one son. She has served on the board of the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute, as well as charing the Hearing CRC, and the tech start-up Fishburners.
Woodthorpe was the Chief Executive of AVCAL, which is the Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association. She has worked in private equity and insurance sectors, as well as technology, healthcare and mining industries. She is also a fellow of the Australian Institute of Company Directors.
Gender Equity
Upon being awarded the Order of Australia, Woodthorpe commented on the role of women in STEM in Australia,
"I hope [receiving this honor] encourages more nomimations of women in science and business worldsl as there are so many more important contributions going unrecognized'.
She has argued that more women are required to be appointed to leadership roles, and specifically, chairing roles, which will allow diverse thinking 'otherwise group think sets in'
Woodthorpe has a syndicate within the organisation "Women in Boards" named after her. She has also been a panelist on an event discussing gender within science, addressing the chronic under-representation and loss of female talent in the scientific workforce, on 'Gender Balance in Science", hosted at ANU.
Media
Woodthorpe has been active on both radio and print media.
In 2018 she said that company directors were being urged by investors to act on climate change. She argued that companies which have infrastructure in coastal areas with risks of climate related events had special interest in acting on climate change.
"In other countries climate change is not a political… and it is disappointing that it is not [given the same support] in Australia".
Woodthorpe has discussed the need for evidence and decisions based on facts, and evidence, particularly in relation to vaccines. She discussed the cuts to funding for science research, arguing that the science cuts will hold back the Australian economy.

In 1978 Sami Esmail, a 24-year-old American citizen of Palestinian descent, was prosecuted in Israel for membership in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The case generated a great deal of interest in the US, especially in the Arab American community and at Michigan State University, where Esmail was an Electrical Engineering graduate student.
Esmail flew to Israel in December 1977 to visit his dying father, who lived in Ramallah. He was arrested on his arrival at Ben-Gurion Airport on December 21 and signed a confession after being imprisoned for six days. Esmail and his supporters in the United States claimed that he had been tortured or mistreated, held without access to a lawyer, and coerced into signing a false confession, among other arguments. Monroe Freedman and Alan Dershowitz visited Israel to observe the trial and wrote a long editorial in The New York Times defending the Israeli government's conduct in the case and Israel's human rights record in general.
Esmail was represented at his trial by the well-known Israeli lawyer Felicia Langer. In June 1978 he was convicted of membership in a hostile organization and sentenced to 15 months in prison, recorded from the date of his arrest. He was released and deported in October 1978, having served 10 months of his sentence. The case later resurfaced at a 1989 American extradition hearing, at which Esmail, Dershowitz, and Freedman all testified, and was mentioned in books by Dershowitz and his critic Norman Finkelstein.
The trial
Esmail was tried before a three-judge panel headed by Dov Levin. His conviction was based on his statements in the disputed confession and in court. Esmail had stated that he had been recruited at MSU, had donated money to the PFLP and assisted in distributing its literature, and had traveled to Libya in 1976 for ideological instruction and military training. Langer had challenged Esmail's confession in court, alleging that he had been kicked, beaten, and deprived of sleep until he had agreed to sign it. However, the court accepted the confession as valid. The court acknowledged that Esmail had come to Israel to visit his father, not on behalf of the PFLP. Esmail was acquitted on the more serious charge of "contact with a foreign agent" on the grounds that the PFLP did not represent a foreign government.
American reaction
American supporters charged that Esmail had been held without access to a lawyer, interrogated harshly, and threatened with being prevented from seeing his dying father unless he signed a confession, rendering his confession invalid. They also argued that Israel was overstepping its authority by trying an American citizen over actions that were legal in the places where they allegedly occurred; the New York Times described this as "the issue of overriding interest" in the case.
In March 1978 pro-Esmail protests were held in New York, Boston, Washington, Detroit, East Lansing, and San Francisco. The city council of Detroit (which had a large Arab-American population) passed a resolution in support of Esmail.

The Dmitrievskaya Tower () is the main tower on the southern wall of the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin which overlooks the Minin and Pozharsky Square. The tower named after a powerful Prince of Suzdal and Nizhny Novgorod Dmitry of Suzdal. Another version claims that the name gave a church which was sanctified of the name of Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki. This church was located opposite the tower.
History
The Dmitrievskaya Tower was built between 1500 and 1516 during the construction of the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin. Its earliest mention comes in 1516 in the chronicle. After 1782 the Dmitrievskaya Tower began to disintegrate and redevelop. The Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin has been completely renovated between 1785 and 1790. Part of the tower above the gates was completely reconstructed. Wall thicknesses was reduced, loopholes were replaced by rectangular windows. Low slanting iron roof was erected. In the early 18th the Kremlin walls and the Dmitrievskaya Tower were traditionally painted white, in accordance with fashion. Height of the tower decreased by 6 m after back filling of a moat between 1834 and 1837 around the Kremlin. A garrison school for soldierly children occupied the tower at the end of the 18th century and the early 19th century. The fortress become dilapidated meanwhile. Between 1958 and 1856 the tower was occupied by the provincial government?s archival depository. Then the Dmitrievskaya Tower was abandoned.
In 1894-95 the tower was restored upon the project of architect Nikolai Sultanov. He was instructed to transform it into an art and historical museum. The upper level was completely rebuilt. Large windows were installed instead of straight teeth, decorating machicolations. Caravans were built up above the West-European-style. The museum was opened in 1896. At the opening ceremony of the museum, Emperor Nicholas II and his wife attended. In 1913 a big celebration was held in honor of the 300th anniversary of the Romanov family near the Dmitrievskaya Tower. The art and historical museum was located in the Dmitrievsky Tower until 1919. Then the exhibits and paintings were taken out and distributed to other places. Some of them were destroyed.
In 1994 the icon of Yuri II of Vladimir was restored above the gate (see picture below).

Miss Latina US, formerly known as Miss Latina USA, is an American beauty pageant exclusively for Latina women in the United States. It is organized by the Miss América Latina Organization. It is open to those of Latin American ethnicity or ancestry. Titles are available for all states, but typically those with larger Latin populations compete every year (such as Texas, California, Florida, New Mexico, Nevada, etc.). Women may also represent their country of birth or those of their parents or grandparents. It was held for the first time as an official national preliminary to the Miss Latin America pageant in 1986. It is also a sister pageant to the Miss Teen US Latina pageant. All three pageants are owned and operated by Miss Latin America Organization, similar to the way the Miss Universe Organization operates the Miss Universe, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants.
The current titleholder of Miss Teen US Latina is Jessania Blanco of Florida.
History
Originally, the Miss Latin America pageant was founded to provide scholarships for Latin American women living in the Miami, Florida region. Only five women participated in the original pageant, held in 1981. In 1982, the number expanded. In 1983, it went international, but individual states were represented at that pageant. As a matter of fact, Cira Sanchez of Texas was the second runner-up, while the representatives from Florida, Arizona and California were top ten finalists (Nevada also competed.) In 1984, ten state representatives participated at the Miss Latin America 1984 pageant, held in Miami Beach, with Florida's representative, Yolanda Fernandez, placing as the first runner-up to Venezuela's Mirla Ochoa. Florida again placed as first runner-up in 1985, and Arizona was a third runner-up. In 1986, a separate pageant was founded, the Miss Latina USA contest. The winner went on to represent the United States at Miss Latin America. This has happened every year since. In 2001, as per agreement with the Miss Universe Organization, who owns the rights to the Miss USA title, the pageant changed its name from Miss Latina USA to Miss Latina US. Additionally, Miss Latin America became post-dated in 1999, changing the contest from Miss Latin America 1999 to Miss Latin America 2000. However, Miss Latina US had not, so Miss Latina USA 1999 went to Miss Latin America 2000. This was corrected in 2008, when the Miss Latina US Pageant held in September 2008 was post-dated and became Miss Latina US 2009, with the winner competing at Miss Latin America 2009. The international pageant was renamed Miss Latin America of the World in 2008 because of the rule changes allowing participation of Latin heritage delegates from around the globe that had begun in 2002.
Miss Latina US 2014
The Miss Latina US 2014 contest was held August 31, 2012 in Riviera Maya, Mexico. Dominican-born Sasha Zacarias of New York was crowned Miss Latina US 2012 by outgoing titleholder Marice Morales of Utah. The runners-up were Ivet Garcia (Minnesota), Leyla Dabdoub (US-Mexico), Ana Valencia (California) and Izabelle Streetmaker (Oklahoma).

Peter V. Brett (born February 8, 1973) is an American fantasy novelist. He is the author of the Demon Cycle, whose first volume was published in the UK by HarperCollins's Voyager imprint in 2008 as The Painted Man and in the US by Del Rey Books as The Warded Man.
Early life
Peter Brett studied English Literature and Art History at the University at Buffalo, graduating in 1995, after which he spent more than ten years working in the pharmaceutical publication field before writing full-time. He developed an interest in fantasy from an early age.
Career
Brett wrote his 2008 novel The Painted Man (The Warded Man in the US) and much of his second novel on his HP iPaq 6515 while on the New York City subway.
The novel takes place on a formerly advanced civilization world that has now been reduced to a dark age by the attacks of demons known as Corelings. These are powerful beings with magical abilities and differing elemental natures, and each night they emerge from the planet's core to feed on humans, who must take care to be indoors before dark. Against this backdrop the three main characters Arlen, Leesha, and Rojer, pass into maturity and begin individual quests to bring an end to the terror. The book and its sequels have been translated into twenty three languages, including German, French, Greek, Japanese, Russian, Polish, Czech, Spanish, Portuguese, Indonesian, Chinese, Dutch, Korean, Estonian, Turkish, Italian, Serbian, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Romanian, Brazilian and Danish.
In The Desert Spear two men are claimed by their own followers to be humanity's prophesied Deliverer. One is Arlen Bales, formerly of a small hamlet who, after many hard lessons, has become the Warded Man (so called because he has covered himself in demon-warding runes). Another contender is a desert warrior, a former friend and betrayer of Arlen, who carries a mystical spear (stolen from Arlen) and heads a vast army intent on a holy war against the demons and anyone else who stands in the way.
Brett's novellas include the 2010 book The Great Bazaar and Other Stories, the 2011 book Brayan's Gold, and the 2014 book Messenger's Legacy.
The Demon Cycle novel has sold over 3.5 million copies worldwide.
Personal life
Brett lives in Manhattan with his wife Lauren and his daughters Cassandra and Sirena. He also enjoys comics and role playing games.

Matthew James Bryza (born February 16, 1964) is a former United States diplomat. His last post in the United States foreign service was the United States Ambassador to Azerbaijan.
Education
Bryza graduated from Stanford University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in International relations and obtained his Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy from The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University in 1988.
Career
Beginning of the foreign service
Bryza joined the United States Foreign Service in August 1988. He then served in Poland in 1989-1991 at the U.S. Consulate in Poznań and the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw, where he covered the Solidarity movement, reform of Poland's security services, and regional politics. From 1991 through 1995, he worked on European and Russian affairs at the State Department. Bryza served at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow during 1995-1997, first as special assistant to Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering and then as a political officer covering the Russian Duma, Communist Party of the Russian Federation, and the Republic of Dagestan in the North Caucasus. He was recalled from Moscow by US Ambassador to Russia because the Ambassador did not believe he could continue effectively fulfilling his role their after hitting and seriously insuring a pedestrian with his car in August 1997. From 1997 through 1998, Bryza was special advisor to Ambassador Richard Morningstar, coordinating U.S. Government assistance programs on economic reforms in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Starting from July 1998, he served as the Deputy Special Advisor to the President and Secretary of State on Caspian Basin Energy Diplomacy, coordinating the U.S. Government's inter-agency efforts to develop a network of oil and gas pipelines in the Caspian region.
European and Eurasian Affairs
In April 2001, Bryza joined the United States National Security Council as Director for Europe and Eurasia, with responsibility for coordinating U.S. policy on Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and Caspian energy. In June 2005, he assumed duties of Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs. He was responsible for policy oversight and management of relations with countries in the Caucasus and Southern Europe. He also led U.S. efforts to advance peaceful settlements of separatist conflicts of Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Additionally, he coordinated U.S. energy policy in the regions surrounding the Black and Caspian Seas and worked with European countries on issues of tolerance, social integration, and Islam.
According to leaked diplomatic cables, Bryza had warned Georgian Interior Minister Vano Merabishvili in May that war would be a bad option for Georgia.
In August 2009, Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) Chairman Ken Hachikian sent a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton outlining the concerns of the Armenian American community regarding what he called the recent "biased remarks by Matt Bryza" the U.S. Co-Chair to the OSCE Minsk Group charged with helping to negotiate a settlement of the Nagorno Karabagh conflict.
Controversy Surrounding Recess Appointment as Ambassador to Azerbaijan
In May 2010, the White House appointed Bryza as the United States Ambassador to Azerbaijan. His nomination ultimately was never confirmed by the full Senate, however, and after serving as Ambassador for less than a year, Bryza left the State Department and joined the Azerbaijani-government affiliated Turcas petrol board.
On September 21, 2010, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved his ambassadorial nomination and sent it to the Senate floor which never approved the nomination. Having failed to receive Senate confirmation for the nomination because of concerns raised by numerous Senators, including Democratic Senators Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Barbara Boxer of California who are Armenian Caucus members, on December 29, 2010, President Obama issued a recess appointment. This recess appointment allowed Bryza to serve as a temporary ambassador. He presented his credentials as ambassador to Azerbaijan on February 17, 2011, and served less than a year until January 3, 2012, when the recess appointment expired.
His nomination was opposed by Armenian-American lobbying groups, as well as the human rights group Reporters Without Borders. Armenian Americans raised conflict of interest concerns including reports that the then Azerbaijani Foreign Minister served as 1 of 3 groomsmen in Bryza's wedding, although Bryza, at the time, was mediating a deadly conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan in his professional capacity as the U.S. Minsk Group Co Chair. Reporters Without Borders raised concerns about the persecution of Azerbaijani reporters who reported that an Azerbaijani government minister partially paid for Bryza's wedding. According to an article by Ganimat Zahid and Agil Khalil in the Azerbaijani newspaper Azadliq, the then Minister of Economic Development of Azerbaijan, Heydar Babayev, paid for a significant portion of Bryza's wedding in Istanbul, Turkey. Both Zahid and Khalil were sued over their article and Azadliq correspondent Agil Khalil was the target of four murder attempts and had to flee to France.
Concerns were also raised over Bryza's incomplete responses to Senate inquiries. In response to questions raised during his Senate confirmation process about the potential conflict of interest between his professional work and the Caucasus-related advocacy of his wife, Caspian energy expert Zeyno Baran, Bryza, asserted: “Since January 2009, she has conducted no conferences, briefings, studies or other official work related to the South Caucasus.” However, there were numerous conferences and briefings where Baran spoke or testified on the South Caucasus after January 2009.
Washington Post editor Fred Hiatt, a powerful supporter of Bryza, described his departure as a "vivid example of how the larger U.S. national interest can fall victim to special-interest jockeying and political accommodation". Hiatt criticized Senators for opposing Bryza's nomination. A few months later, Bryza left the State Department to join the Azerbaijani-government affiliated Turcas petrol board.
Post foreign service career
Bryza works as a consultant on business and democratic development, and is a board member of several private companies in Turkey. Within months of leaving the State Department after the Senate failed to confirm his nomination to be ambassador to Azerbaijan partly because of conflict of interest concerns, Bryza was appointed in June 2012 as a board member of Turcas Petrol, an affiliate of State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), a fully state-owned national oil and gas company headquartered in Baku, Azerbaijan. Bryza is also a board member in NEQSOL holdings, an Azerbaijani energy and communications conglomerate.
Since March 1, 2012, Bryza has been appointed the Director of the International Centre for Defense Studies, a Tallinn-based think tank. In August 2012, he became board member of the Jamestown Foundation.
Awards
Bryza was awarded with Fletcher Young Alumni Award in 2004, Order of the Golden Fleece, Georgia in 2009, Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana, Fourth Class, Republic of Estonia in 2010.
Personal life
His first marriage ended in divorce. On August 23, 2007, he married Zeyno Baran, from whom he has a daughter. He lives with his family in Istanbul, Turkey.
Bryza is fluent in Polish and Russian, and also speaks German and Spanish, and conversational Azerbaijani.

Charles White Blair (February 5, 1829 – August 20, 1899) was a lawyer, and Union Army officer who served in three different regiments during the American Civil War. He fought primarily in the Trans-Mississippi Theater and was notable during Price's Missouri Raid.
Early life and career
Blair was born in Georgetown, Ohio February 5, 1829. He became a lawyer before moving to Kansas. At the outbreak of the war, he was commissioned a captain in the 2nd Kansas Volunteer Infantry Regiment and fought at the battle of Wilson's Creek. He resigned in October 1861 but was reappointed as major of the 2nd Kansas Cavalry in February 1862. He fought with the 2nd Kansas Cavalry at the first Battle of Newtonia. Blair commanded Fort Scott during 1863. In October 1863 he was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 14th Kansas Cavalry, his third and final regiment of the war. In November 1863 he was promoted to colonel of that regiment.
Command of the 3rd Brigade
Throughout 1864 the 14th Kansas Cavalry was attached to the VII Corps and fought under Frederick Steele during the Camden Expedition. During this time however, Company E was detached to the Department of Kansas under Samuel R. Curtis. Blair personally accompanied this detachment to the headquarters of James G. Blunt's Provisional Cavalry Division of the Army of the Border.
There, he was placed in command of Blunt's 3rd Brigade. This command assignment proved to be a cumbersome arrangement for Blair.
The 3rd Brigade was primarily composed of Kansas State Militia regiments of Brigadier General William H. M. Fishback's command. Fishback resented taking orders from a colonel.
The command structure of the 3rd Brigade became a "brigade within a brigade". Fishback was in direct command of the militia regiments attached to the 3rd Brigade while Blair was in overall command of the brigade which also included his own 14th Kansas Cavalry detachment and the 9th Wisconsin Artillery Battery. When the Union army moved east, the Kansas State Militia units refused to cross over into Missouri claiming they would defend Kansas, not Missouri. Fishback used the opportunity to send one regiment back home without orders. Blunt had Fishback arrested but he was soon released by order of General Curtis. Fishback returned to his militia units within the 3rd Brigade and was instructed to take orders from Blair and General Blunt. This affair caused Blair's brigade to miss the fighting at the second battle of Lexington. As the Union forces retreated from Independence, Blair's men constructed earthworks along the Big Blue River.
Westport
At the battle of the Big Blue River Blair's brigade was attached to the Kansas Militia Division under General George Deitzler. The militia units in general fared poorly in their first real engagement and retreated with the rest of the Union army into Westport.
Blunt arranged three of his brigades in a line of battle south of Westport with Blair in support. As the battle raged back and forth Curtis arrived at the front with Blair's brigade and directed it into position perpendicular to the Kansas/Missouri state line. Fearful of a being outflanked, Blair initiated a counter-attack. Curtis ordered the rest of the army forward in support of Blair's bold move. The attack bogged down, but at this critical moment Curtis personally led Blair's 9th Wisconsin Battery through a gulch which opened fire on the Confederate flank. This turned the tide of the battle and the Confederates began a retreat. Blair's brigade formed in the center of the Union army as it made a general advance against the faltering Confederate line.
Mine Creek and Post War Career
The sense of urgency gone with the victory at Westport, most of the Kansas Militia units returned home. A few units in Blair's brigade remained in the field and took part in the pursuit of Confederates. Alfred Pleasonton's Union cavalry caught the retreating Confederate forces along Mine Creek in Kansas. Hampered by their wagon train many Confederates were taken prisoner including two generals. One of these generals was John S. Marmaduke who formally surrendered to Blair. Blair received a brevet promotion to brigadier general on February 13, 1865 and was mustered out of the volunteer service on August 11, 1865.
After the war Blair returned to his legal practice. He died at Coronado Beach, California on August 20, 1899.

A green data center, or sustainable data center, is a service facility which utilizes energy-efficient technologies. They do not contain obsolete systems (such as inactive or underused servers), and take advantage of newer, more efficient technologies.
With the exponential growth and usage of the Internet, power consumption in data centers has increased significantly. Due to the resulting environmental impact, increase in public awareness, higher cost of energy and legislative action, increased pressure has been placed on companies to follow a green policy. For these reasons, the creation of sustainable data centers has become essential in an environmental and a business sense.
Energy use
The use of high-performance computing techniques has increased, trading energy consumption for increased performance. Industry estimates suggest that data centers consume three to five percent of the world's global energy. According to an AFCOM State of the Data Center survey, 70 percent of data-center providers indicated that power density per rack has increased significantly since 2013. Managers have been forced to find new ways to power their data centers with renewable energy sources such as hydro, solar, geothermal, and wind. More efficient technologies were developed to decrease data-center power consumption.
Metrics
Several metrics have been developed to measure power efficiency in data centers. Power usage effectiveness (PUE) and carbon usage effectiveness (CUE) are two frequently-used metrics created by the Green Grid (TGG), a global consortium dedicated to advancing energy efficiency in data centers.
Power usage effectiveness
PUE was invented in 2007, and proposed new guidelines to measure energy use in data centers.
This ratio describes how much extra energy a data center needs to maintain IT equipment for every watt delivered to the equipment. The best PUE a data center can have is 1: an ideal situation, with no extra energy use. When PUE was introduced, studies found that the industry-average PUE was between 2.5 and 3. In more recent studies, the average PUE fell to about 1.7 by using this framework. PUE began the shift of the data-center industry towards energy efficiency.
Although PUE is the most-frequently-used metric for data centers to measure energy efficiency, its reliability is still debated;
Carbon usage effectiveness
Carbon usage effectiveness (CUE) is another metric used to measure energy usage and sustainability in data centers. It is calculated with the following formula:
Another way to express this formula is as the product of the carbon dioxide emission factor (CEF) and the PUE, where the CEF is the kg of CO2 produced for each kilowatt-hour of electricity:

Certifications
Data centers in the United States may apply to be certified as green data centers. The most widely used green building rating system is the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). Developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, it is available in several categories. Depending on ratings, data centers may receive a silver, gold or platinum certification. The platinum certification is given to data centers with the highest level of environmentally-responsible construction and efficient use of resources.
Data centers may also be certified under the National Data Center Energy Efficiency Information Program by Energy Star, part of an initiative by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy. The program certifies buildings and consumer products for energy efficiency. Only data centers which are in the top 25 percent in energy performance may receive Energy Star certification.
Technologies
Several technologies increase efficiency and decrease energy consumption in data centers.
Low-power servers
Low-power servers are more energy-efficient than conventional servers in data centers. They use the technology of smartphone computing, which tries to balance performance with energy consumption. The first low-power servers were introduced in 2012 by large IT providers such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard. Used correctly, low-power servers can be much more efficient than conventional servers. They can have a significant impact on data-center efficiency, decreasing power consumption and the operating cost of cooling facilities.
Modular data centers
A modular data center is a portable data center which can be placed anywhere data capacity is needed. Compared with traditional data centers, they are designed for rapid deployment, energy efficiency and high density. These ready-made data centers in a box became very popular. The HP EcoPod modular data center supports over 4,000 data centers with a PUE rating of 1.05 in and free-air cooling.
Free air cooling
Free air cooling systems uses external wind instead of traditional data-center computer room air conditioner (CRAC) units. Although outdoor air still needs to be filtered and moisturized, much less energy is required to cool a data center with this method. Outdoor air temperature is an issue here, and the data center's location plays a critical role in this technology.
Hot and cold aisle containment
In this method, the rows of racks are aligned with the backs of the servers facing each other; the aisles are enclosed, to capture the air. In hot aisle containment, the heat produced by the servers is pumped to the cooling units. In cold aisle containment, cold air is pumped to the enclosed aisles. Both containment methods are more effective than traditional cooling technologies, and can help reduce energy consumption (and its impact). Although it may be more difficult to implement, hot aisle containment is more effective than cold aisle containment.
Reusing waste heat
Data centers use electric power, releasing more than 98 percent of this electricity as heat. Waste heat can be actively reused, and a data center becomes a closed-loop heating system with no waste. Examples include:
The IBM Reusing Data Center in Switzerland, where the heat warms a local swimming pool
In Finland, the Yandex and Academica data centers replacing the heat used by 500-1,000 homes with data-center energy.
Amazon reused heat from a nearby data center for a biosphere project in Seattle.
Ultrasonic humidification
Some humidity is necessary for data centers to work efficiently and prevent damage to devices and servers. Ultrasonic humidification uses ultrasound to create moisture, using 90 percent less energy than conventional methods such as resistance steam humidifiers.
Evaporative cooling
Evaporative cooling reduces heat by the evaporation of water. Two main methods are used: evaporation pads and high-pressure spray systems. With evaporation pads – the more popular method – air is drawn through the pads, making water evaporate and cooling the air. The other technique, high-pressure spray systems, needs a larger area and consumes more energy with pumps. Evaporative cooling is dependent on geographical location and season, because both affect the moisture level of the air. Compared to traditional mechanical cooling systems, evaporative cooling generally uses significantly less electricity.
Investment in Green Data Center
According to a new study by Arizton Advisory & Intelligence, the total investment in the green data center market across the globe marked $35.58 billion in 2021. The investment is expected to grow by a CAGR of 7.6%.

Homotopia is a 2007 short film by Eric A. Stanley and Chris E. Vargas. This film is a radical queer critique of the politics of gay marriage and assimilation and addresses issues of racism, colonialism, HIV/AIDS, and the state. Using a gritty shoot-and-run style, the film is also heavily influenced by Born in Flames and The Battle of Algiers.
Homotopia uses a radical queer/feminist critique of the institution of marriage to argue against the logic that "gay marriage" would lead to queer liberation. Yoshi falls in love with someone he meets in a park bathroom while reading Frantz Fanon's Black Skin, White Masks. Sadly, his new love interest is about to get married to another man. Yoshi and his band of radical queers decide to interrupt the wedding.
Homotopia stars San Francisco-based performance/visual artist Jason/Joy Fritz, gender illusionist Susan Withans, Kentaro J. Kaneko who worked with Gay Shame, Ralowe T. Ampu formerly of Deep Dickollective, and author/activist Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore also known as Matt Bernstein Sycamore.
A sequel to Homotopia was created eight years later, titled Criminal Queers. The film is a "prison-break style comedy", meant as a commentary on the American prison system and its oppression of queer folk.
The film has fewer than 50 ratings on Rotten Tomatoes, has a 7.2/10-star rating with 20 reviews on IMDb, and has one 2-star rating on Letterboxd.

Veronica Bucket is a mechanism for handwashing originating in Ghana which consists of a bucket of water with a tap fixed at the bottom, mounted at hand height, and a bowl at the bottom to collect waste water. The Veronica bucket was developed by Veronica Bekoe. The Veronica bucket serves as a simple way to encourage proper handwashing using flowing water. Bekoe in an interview stated that the bucket was originally made to help her and her colleagues wash their hands under running water after each lab session. She said, "We are used to washing hands in a bowl with others washing in the same water, which will do more harm than good." These colleagues were contaminating their hands rather than decontaminating them. In addition to the COVID benefit of handwashing, Veronica Bucket is also essential for areas where potable water is not readily available.
Uses
The bucket is also used in other African countries. It is common in places such as schools, hospitals, churches and in areas with no running taps. It has become very popular in Ghana following the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as citizens engage in frequent handwashing to stem its spread. In Ekiti State, Nigeria, the governor Kayode Fayemi directed all public places to provide running tap water or Veronica buckets "to encourage frequent handwashing" as part of the measures to contain COVID-19.
Before the COVID-19 outbreak, the invention was used in some schools and hospitals but it is in high demand due to its role in curbing the outbreak. Now, the set up could be spotted in places like the malls, hospitals, corporate institutions and government offices. It was invented by a Ghanaian, Veronica Bekoe, whom the invention was named after. She claimed the bucket was named after her in 1993 by Joan Hetrick. Bekoe is a biological scientist who has worked at the Public Health and Reference Laboratory of the Ghana Health Service from 1972 to 2008.
Production
The invention was initially produced by local artisans with aluminium utensils used in selling Hausa koko attached with a tap which was a prototype, popularly known as Akorlaa gyae su and currently it made of plastic with a tap attached to it which has an area for holding soap and towels. Variations available today comes in all colours.
In February 2021, Veronica Bekoe launched an updated version of the bucket to reduce physical contact with the unit and further help halt the spread of COVID-19.

Jack Lynch (1910–1966) was an Australian rugby league footballer who played in the 1930s in the New South Wales Rugby Football League competition. His club career was with Eastern Suburbs and St. George.
Lynch attended Sydney's Waverley College, before being graded by the Eastern Suburbs club. He made his First Grade debut for Eastern Suburbs in 1930, the same year as 1930s league star Dave Brown, who had also attended Waverley College.
Club career
In his debut match, the young winger, scored a hat trick of tries against Balmain. He was a member of the Eastern Suburbs side that was defeated by South Sydney in the 1931 premiership decider.
In 1931, Lynch managed to top the competition in terms of both points and tries scored.
Lynch joined the St. George club in 1933 where he played three seasons before returning to Eastern Suburbs in 1936. The Tricolours side that season was one of rugby league's greatest ever club sides, managing to finish the season undefeated. Lynch, playing in the centres to replace the injured Jack Beaton, was one of Eastern Suburbs' try scorers in the premiership-deciding match against Balmain. In 1937, Lynch returned to St. George Dragons where he played his final season.
During his career, Lynch played 88 first grade matches scoring a total of 416 points (40 tries and 148 goals). 59 of those matches were for Eastern Suburbs where he scored 28 tries and 142 goals, whilst during his time at St. George he scored 48 points (12 tries and 6 goals).
Administrative career
Following his retirement from the game as a player he became a graded referee, was a lower grade coach at the Eastern Suburbs club and served Club Secretary during the 1950s.
In 1963 he was a manager for that year's Kangaroo tour and a deputy vice-president of the New South Wales Rugby Football League.
Jack Lynch died after a suffering a heart attack in 1966.

Apalharpactes is a genus of birds in the family Trogonidae. They are restricted to humid highland forest on the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra. Unlike all other Asian trogons, their plumage is mainly green above and yellow below. Compared to most trogons, the sexual dimorphism is relatively small. The two species in the genus resemble each other, but A. reinwardtii is larger than A. mackloti, and the male A. mackloti has a chestnut rump-patch, which A. reinwardtii lacks. They feed on arthropods, small lizards and fruit.
Taxonomy
The members of Apalharpactes are sometimes placed in the genus Harpactes instead. However a 2010 study found that the two genera are actually distantly related and thus valid.
The two species of Apalharpactes were formerly treated as conspecific under the name red-billed trogon or blue-tailed trogon (Apalharpactes reinwardtii, with mackloti as a subspecies), but are better treated as separate species.

The Fifth Camp of Rochambeau's Infantry, also known as Site 12-25, is a historic site and an archeological site in Bolton, Connecticut, on the march route of Rochambeau's army on its way to the Hudson River and ultimately to Yorktown, Virginia. It was used on four successive nights, the 22nd through the 25th of June, 1781, by the four divisions of Rochambeau's army (the Bourbonnais, the Royal Deux-Ponts, the Soissonnais, and the Saintonge). In the evenings, the French entertained locals by playing music and dancing with local women, on Bolton Green.
About before the Fifth Camp is March Route of Rochambeau's Army: Bailey Road, and about a mile before that is March Route of Rochambeau's Army: Hutchinson Road, both on the way from Andover, and both also NRHP-listed. The road to the Fifth Camp was described as "frightful". The Bourbonnais division had to bivouac without its tents, as its supply wagons were delayed on the poor roads.
It is a site that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.
The site is listed for its information potential. According to a study completed in 2001, the site "is an open field that retains its visual qualities, with stone walls marking the same field lines as shown on the map prepared by the French engineers. The camp was occupied for four nights in a row, one night by each regiment, in June, 1781. A large number of artifacts have been recovered to date, including numbered regimental buttons, .66 caliber musket balls, period coins, and a lead bar."
The camp site was not used on the return march in 1782; the 46th camp site was at a different location in what is now Andover which was then part of Bolton.

Naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid is an organic compound with the formula C10H7SO3H. A colorless, water-soluble solid, it is often available as the dihydrate C10H7SO3H.2H2O. It is one of two monosulfonic acids of naphthalene, the other being the more stable naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid. The compound is mainly used in the production of dyes.
Naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid undergoes many reactions, some of which are or were of commercial interest. Upon heating with dilute aqueous acid, it reverts to naphthalene. Fusion with sodium hydroxide followed by acidification gives 1-naphthol. Further sulfonation gives 1,5-naphthalene-disulfonic acid. Reduction with triphenylphosphine gives 1-naphthalenethiol.

Paschalococos disperta, the Rapa Nui palm or Easter Island palm, formerly Jubaea disperta, was the native cocoid palm species of Easter Island. It disappeared from the pollen record circa AD 1650.
It is not known whether the species is distinct from Jubaea, but there is no evidence that it was Jubaea either, as the soft tissues used for identification of cocoid genera have not been preserved. All that remain are pollen from lake beds, hollow endocarps (nuts) found in a cave, and casts of root bosses. Partly to avoid giving credence to the common but speculative assumption that the palms were Jubaea chilensis and used as rollers to move the moai statues of Easter Island, John Dransfield assigned the species to a new genus. The assignment is not accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, which does not list the genus Paschalococos, nor by The Plant List which regards the name as "unresolved".
Human overpopulation in the period AD 800 to 1600 led to extinction of the Rapa Nui palm. Hogan believes that loss of the Rapa Nui palm along with other biota contributed to the collapse of society on Easter Island. Dransfield suggests that the trees became extinct as they were cut down for the edible palm hearts as food supplies ran out for an island overpopulated by humans. It is also likely that many palms were cut down to build canoes for fishing. Another possibility is the Polynesian rat, brought in by settlers arriving between AD 800 and 1000, consumed the nuts of the palm, leaving insufficient numbers to reseed the island.
Despite the extinction of the tree, this palm appears to have been represented two hundred years later in the Rongorongo script of Easter Island with the glyph .

Tsepon Wangchuk Deden Shakabpa (, January 11, 1907 – February 23, 1989) was a Tibetan nobleman, scholar, statesman and former Finance Minister of the government of Tibet.
Biography
Tsepon Shakabpa was born in Lhasa Tibet. His father, Laja Tashi Phuntsok Shakabpa was a senior lay official in charge of the government treasury, and the steward of Lhasa. His father's brother was Trimon Norbu Wangyal, who became the most influential minister in the cabinet of the 13th Dalai Lama. His mother was Samdup Dolma, from the Ngodrupding family. The third Reting Gyalpo Ngawang Yeshe Tsultrim Gyaltsen was born into the Ngodrupding family, and ruled Tibet as Regent from 1845 to 1862. His mother's older brother was Lonchen Changkyim, one of the group of three Prime Ministers during the reign of the 13th Dalai Lama. The younger brother of his mother, was Ngoshi Jampa Thuwang, personal physician of the 13th Dalai Lama. Both his maternal uncles accompanied the Great 13th into exile to India in 1910. Shakabpa joined the Government at the age of 23 in 1930, as an official of the Treasury.
He was appointed Minister of Finance in 1939, a position he held until 1950. His paternal uncle Trimon, who had participated in the tripartite negotiations between Great Britain, China and Tibet in 1914, strongly encouraged him to take up an interest in Tibetan history. Trimon in 1931, handed him many documents he had personally collected from the Simla Accord negotiations, in order to counter the Chinese narrative accounts concerning his country.
Between late 1947 and early 1949, Shakabpa, in his capacity as Tibet's Finance Minister, was dispatched abroad by the Tibetan Cabinet, or Kashag, as head of a Tibetan Trade Mission. This Tibet Trade Delegation traveled around to world to investigate the possibilities of commercial treaties, particularly with the United States. He traveled to India, China, USA, England, France, Switzerland and Italy. The mission was intended also to strengthen claims for Tibet as an independent, sovereign nation. The Tibetan Government in Exile argues that the official passport he was issued with at the time illustrates that Tibet was an independent country.
As Chinese forces spilled over into Amdo and Kham, Shakabpa and Tsechak Khenchung Thupten Gyalpo were appointed to serve as chief negotiators with the Chinese. The mission was aborted when the Tibetan cabinet minister in eastern Tibet, Ngapo Ngawang Jigme, apparently arranged an agreement with the Chinese. When the PRC entered Tibet in 1951, Shakabpa went into exile, moving to India. There he rallied international support for Tibetan independence, than remain in Tibet and be forced to collaborate with the communists. He was the chief diplomatic representative of the 14th Dalai Lama to the Indian government in New Delhi from 1959 to 1966. It was from this time on that Shakabpa began to concentrate on a rigorous and extensive study of Tibetan history.
As events in Tibet deteriorated in the mid-fifties, he began to organize the Tibetan resistance together with the Dalai Lama's two older brothers, Gyalo Thondup and the Taktser Rinpoche also known as Thubten Jigme Norbu. After China's violent suppression of Tibetan demonstrations, and the flight of the Dalai Lama and 80,000 Tibetans into exile, Shakabpa played a key role in developing the exile infrastructure. These responsibilities included establishing of settlements for assisting the new diaspora in India, providing sustenance for the refugees, and organizing schools. And also the immigration of many young Tibetans across Western Europe in the early sixties. In this capacity as the Dalai Lama's chief representative, he was centrally responsible for developing the infrastructure to take care of the Tibetan exiles in India. He also played the role of a sort of Tibetan ambassador-at-large for the Dalai Lama in New Delhi. In May 1985, the Kashag (Tibetan Cabinet) of the government-in-exile honored him at a special ceremony, and presented him with a commendation that said in part, "in appreciation of his distinguished service for the independence of Tibet, we would like to honor him as a great exponent of the political history of Tibet". His major work, Tibet: A Political History, published by Yale University Press in 1967, has been judged 'the most thorough explication in a western language of a Tibetan's view of their history' down to recent times. His perspective views the historical relationship between China and Tibet as flowing from the model of preceptor and patron(mchod gnas dang yon bdag) established by Genghis Khan, whereby 'the Lama serv(ed) as the spiritual guide and preceptor of the Khan. And the Khan played the role of the protector and patron of the Lama,' and that Tibet was 'forcibly incorporated into China under the threat of military destruction only in 1951'. This book, and in his more definitive account in Tibetan, published in 1976, have not only been sharply critiqued by Chinese Tibetologists but have come under continuous and aggressive attack by Beijing.
Shakabpa lived in New Delhi, Kalimpong and Manhattan. He died of stomach cancer in 1989, at the age of 82, in the home of his youngest son, Tsoltim Ngima Shakabpa, in Corpus Christi, Texas. His children are Kunsang Namdrol better known as KN, Tsering Wangyal better known as TW, Champa Ongmo, Tsoltim Ngima better known as TN, and Thupten Chukie, alias TC.

Tsepon Shakabpa Passport Recovery (2003)
A photograph of the historic Tsepon Shakabpa passport was originally published in 1967 in his book Tibet: A Political History. The historic document got lost from the Tibetan community in 1992 and there were rumours that it had been sold to antique dealers and reached into the hands of Chinese government officials. After 13 years of mystery and search, the Friends of Tibet Foundation located the historic passport with an antique dealer in Nepal and purchased the document for an undisclosed amount to be presented to the XIV Dalai Lama in the year 2004. Issued by the Kashag to Tibet's finance minister Shakabpa for foreign travel, the passport was a single piece of pink paper, complete with photographs. It has a message in hand-written Tibetan and typed English, similar to the message by the nominal issuing officers of today's passports, stating that "the bearer of this letter – Tsepon Shakabpa, Chief of the Finance Department of the Government of Tibet, is hereby sent to China, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and other countries to explore and review trade possibilities between these countries and Tibet. We shall, therefore, be grateful if all the Governments concerned on his route would kindly give due recognition as such, grant necessary passport, visa, etc. without any hindrance and render assistance in all possible ways to him." The text and the photograph are sealed by a square stamp belonging to the Kashag and is dated "26th day of the 8th month of Fire-Pig year (Tibetan)" (10 October 1947 in the Gregorian calendar).
The passport has received visa and entry stamps from several countries and territories, including India, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Switzerland, Pakistan, Iraq and Hong Kong, but not China. Some visas do reflect an official status, with mentions such as "Diplomatic courtesy, Service visa, Official gratis, Diplomatic visa, for government official".
Today this historic document remains to stand as an important proof of the independent status of Tibet legally recognized by other countries before China's invasion of Tibet in 1949.

Ryan Duffy is a journalist and correspondent best known for his work with Vice Media, including accompanying Dennis Rodman and the Harlem Globetrotters on a visit to North Korea in 2013. Duffy began his career at Vice as an intern while studying journalism at New York University. In 2012, Duffy appeared on Forbes' 30 under 30 list. In 2015, he started a series of short documentary reports with The Huffington Post titled Now What with Ryan Duffy.
Ryan was also the vocalist in the NYC punk band, Dear Tonight. They released several records and went on tour in Europe and the US.
North Korea trip
In 2013, as a Vice journalist Duffy accompanied Dennis Rodman and the Harlem Globetrotters on a visit to North Korea, a move which garnered criticism from the diplomatic community and the journalistic world. Along with Rodman and the Globetrotters, Duffy competed in a basketball exhibition game against the North Korean national team.
After meeting supreme leader Kim Jong-un, Duffy observed that "the leader was 'socially awkward' and didn't make eye contact when shaking hands".
While in Pyongyang, Duffy and the other members of the Vice crew attended a lavish dinner hosted by Kim Jong-un. "It was the most surreal experience of my life," Mojica said. Jason Mojica, the show's executive producer, tweeted just prior to the dinner: "Um... so Kim Jong-un just got the #VICEonHBO crew wasted... no really, that happened." McCarthy told the Associated Press: "Dinner was an epic feast. Felt like about 10 courses in total. I'd say the winners were the smoked turkey and sushi, though we had the Pyongyang cold noodles earlier in the trip and that's been the runaway favorite so far." Duffy, McCarthy, and the others were criticized on social media and on news sites for Tweets they posted and comments made to the press praising their cuisine, in lieu of the fact that 150,000 and 2,000,000 North Koreans died of starvation in a famine between 1994 and 1998. The website Gawker posted intermingling tweets and photos of Mojica and his colleagues with images of starving infants and children on the verge of death. New York Magazine commented: "Aside from the brutal slave-labor camps, the routine rape and torture of political prisoners, mass starvation extreme enough to induce episodes of cannibalism... North Korea sounds like a blast!" The New York Times has reported that as many as two million North Koreans have died of starvation.
Vice Sports
In 2014, Vice launched Vice Sports with Duffy as publisher, but Duffy left the project as it debuted. Duffy had also been slated to host the channel's Vice World of Sports docuseries.
Now What with Ryan Duffy
In October 2015, as part of a slate of 12 new shows, The Huffington Post launched the docuseries Now What with Ryan Duffy. Site founder Arianna Huffington cited the riots in Baltimore following the death of Freddie Gray as an example of the kinds of solution-based situations Duffy's program would address, criticizing existing coverage as creating "copycat crimes instead of copycat solutions."

Philometridae is a family of nematodes belonging to the order Rhabditida. All Philometridae are obligate tissue parasites of fish.
Life cycle
Philometridae cycle between two hosts: Cyclopoida (small crustaceans) as an intermediate host, and various fish as a definitive host. First-stage larvae are ejected into the water, and develop to the third stage if they're eaten by a cyclopoid. Once the copepod is eaten by a fish, the larvae develop into adults and mate. Pregnant females migrate to a final site just under the fish's skin, in the swim bladder, or in the coelom; males die soon after mating and in many Philometridae species they have never been described.

Toshiro Konishi (July 11, 1953 – April 16, 2016) was a Japanese Peruvian chef, musician, and television personality. Konishi, a pioneer of Japanese cuisine in Peru, opened one of the first Japanese restaurants in Lima in 1977. He was one of Peru's most famous chefs, and became a recognized television personality in the country. In 2008, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries awarded him the Minister's Prize. Konishi was the first Japanese chef based in Latin America to receive the award from the ministry.
Early life
Konishi was born on July 11, 1953. He was the fourth son of a Japanese restaurateur in Saito, Miyazaki Prefecture. He began working in the kitchen when he was 11 years old. In 1971, he moved to Tokyo to become a chef at a restaurant called Fumi.
Career
In 1977, Konishi moved from Japan to Peru to work with another chef, Nobu Matsuhisa, who is now known for his Nobu fusion restaurants in Peru, the United States, and other countries. Konishi worked and operated a Lima restaurant called Matsuei, one of the first in the city to specialize in Japanese food, for ten years. He then opened two additional Japanese eateries, Toshiro's and Wako, which were located in Lima's Sheraton hotel.
Konishi was an early pioneer of Peruvian Fusion cuisine, which mixes Japanese and Peruvian culinary traditions. He was a regular participant in international food festivals. He also taught at Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola in Lima. He opened Mesa 18 at the Miraflores Hotel in Lima in 2013, and the Oishii, his most recent restaurant, in 2015.
In 2008, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries awarded him the Minister's Prize. Konishi was the first Japanese chef based in Latin America to receive the award from the ministry.
Konishi died from cancer on April 17, 2016, at the age of 63. His wife and daughter have since taken over the Toshiro brand.

Max
is a professional Japanese baseball outfielder and first baseman for the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). He previously played in NPB for the Hanshin Tigers.
Early baseball career
A native of Fukuoka, he began playing as a catcher for the Mikuni Honeys in grade school, then went on to join the Futsukaichi Lions in junior high where he got to participate in national tournaments.
Upon entering high school, he secured the outfielder post for the Fukuoka Koudai Joto High School. He was elected as team captain in his second year, but his team never made it past the elimination rounds to summer Koshien. He attended the same high school as fellow Tiger's teammate Ryutaro Umeno who was a year ahead, and like Umeno, he started as an outfielder and graduated as a catcher.
Professional career
Hanshin Tigers
Nakatani was selected as the Hanshin Tigers' 3rd round pick in the 2010 Nippon Professional Baseball draft. He signed as a catcher on a contract of 50 million yen and an annual salary of 6 million. He was given the jersey number 60.
2011
In 2011, Nakatani played in 23 Western League games (minors) and batted .261 with 4 RBIs. Because he played mostly as an outfielder and not as a catcher, they changed his training regimen from a catcher to an outfielder at the end of the season.
2012
Nakatani spent most of the 2012 season playing in the minors. He was selected to play in the mid-season Fresh All Star Game on July 18, and was selected as the game's MVP when he scored 2 hits and 3 RBIs. On August 23, he debuted in his 1st official game as the starting right fielder in the match against the Chunichi Dragons at the Kurashiki Muscat Stadium. He appeared in 5 more games, but he failed to record a hit in any of them. He finished the season in the minors, with a .225 batting average, 3 home runs and 27 RBIs.
2013
In 2013, the Tigers officially changed Nakatani's position from catcher to outfielder. He spent the entire season in the farm, and batted .201 in 100 games, with 31 RBIs and 2 home runs.
2014
Nakatani also didn't appear in any main squad matches in this year, and batted his worst at .190 in 93 minor league games. His home run count improved to 7.
2015
Nakatani's improved performance in the minors early in the season finally earned him a spot in the main squad in a match against the Hiroshima Toyo Carp on May 8. He recorded his first official hit as a pro on May 9, but when he went hitless in the next matches, he got sent back to the farm on May 15. He continued to perform well in Western League games, and even got selected as the League MVP of the Month in July. In all his 94-game appearances, he recorded an average of .290 with 9 home runs and 40 RBIs, and was named the Western League's MVP of the season.
2016
Nakatani spent the earlier half of the 2016 season in the farm, where new batting coach and Tigers legend Masayuki Kakefu helped him undergo training to improve his batting form. His efforts paid off when he got called to play with the main squad in June. He recorded his first career RBI on June 19, and his first career home run a few days after. His appearances gradually increased until October, mostly as a center fielder or as a pinch hitter, and he finished the season with 14 RBIs, 4 home runs and a batting average of .266 in 64 games.
2017
Nakatani had a shaky start early in the 2017 season as he competed with young guns Shun Takayama and Fumihito Haraguchi for regular playing time in the outfield or at first base. His breakout performance started in May when he went on a hitting spree and reached 5 home runs by the 3rd week. He was rewarded by being assigned the clean up spot for the first time in a May 28 match against the Yokohama DeNA BayStars, and continued to be a regular starting player in the next couple of months. He went 5-for-5 against the Saitama Seibu Lions on June 15, and recorded two hits and two RBIs including a two-run home run against Yomiuri on July 9. This earned him the Sanspo Excellent Player Award for his performance during the Sanspo's Hanshin Tigers Gekirei Series (June 13 to July 12). By July 23, he was leading the team in home runs batted in (10 HRs). He continued to hit well, and even hit home runs in 3 consecutive matches against the Tokyo Yakult Swallows on August 22. In a September 18 match against the Hiroshima Toyo Carp at Koshien Stadium, he recorded his 20th home run of the season in the fourth inning against Yusuke Nomura. He became the first Hanshin right-handed hitting lifer (a player who has played with only one team) to reach 20 home runs since Osamu Hamanaka hit 20 in 2006 (Hamanaka was a lifer at the time he recorded twenty home runs). In 133 main squad game appearances, he led the team in RBIs and home runs (61 RBIs, 20 home runs), with 99 hits and an OPS of 0.697. His performance earned him a 12 million pay raises, making an estimated annual salary of 36 million yen for 2018.
2018
Nakatani fell into a slump during spring camp in 2018 and batting only .143 during the exhibition games. Nakatanie failed to make it into the main squad when the season started. His slump continued in the farm, (39 games, .197 average, 3 home runs), but when the main squad needed batting reinforcement, he got called to play on May 22. In the 9th inning of a May 26 game against the Yomiuri Giants, with 2 outs and a runner on 2nd, Nakatani notched his 1st career walk off hit at Koshien. From June onwards however, his performance began to deteriorate, and with the improving performance of other outfielders, his starts gradually decreased. He only appeared in a total of 77 games, hit 26 RBIs with only 5 home runs.
2019
Nakatani played in 62 games for Hanshin in 2019, also playing in 43 games for the farm team. In 131 plate appearances, Nakatani posted a tepid .181/.264/.379 slash with 6 home runs and 19 RBI.
2020
In 2020, the season was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nakatani spent the majority of the year with Hanshin's main team, logging a .215/.267/.304 batting line with 2 home runs and 16 RBI in 70 games.
2021
Nakatani began the 2021 season with Hanshin's farm team after poor performance in the seasons prior. With the farm team, Nakatani posted a .266 average with 5 home runs and 26 RBI.
Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks
On July 2, 2021, Nakatani was traded to the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in exchange for Akira Niho.

"Johnny 99" is a song written and recorded by rock musician Bruce Springsteen, which first appeared on Springsteen's 1982 solo album Nebraska.
Performance and themes
In "Johnny 99" Springsteen sings about an autoworker who gets laid off in Mahwah, New Jersey and shoots and kills a night clerk while drunk and distraught. As a result, he is apprehended and is sentenced to 99 years in prison, but requests to be executed instead. On the song, Springsteen is accompanied only by his acoustic guitar, although he doubles on harmonica as well. Despite the bleakness of the song's themes - including unemployment, poverty, robbery, murder and possibly execution - the tune is ironically jaunty, with a shuffling rockabilly beat.
Like several other songs on the Nebraska album, "Johnny 99" is a song about complete despair. It has direct links with certain songs on Nebraska: the protagonist in "Johnny 99" notes that he has "debts no honest man could pay," repeating a line used by the protagonist in "Atlantic City", and, like the title song, "Johnny 99" is about a murderer — though rather than being a psychopath like the protagonist in the title song, "Johnny 99" is motivated by his economic circumstances.
History
Like the rest of the Nebraska album, "Johnny 99" was recorded in January 1982 in a no-frills studio set up in Springsteen's home in Colts Neck, New Jersey. Most likely it was recorded on January 3, 1982, when most of the album tracks were recorded.
The background of the song is based on a real-life incident, the closing in 1980 of a Ford Motor Company plant in Mahwah, which had been open since 1955. The song also has antecedents in two folk songs that appeared on the box set Anthology of American Folk Music: Julius Daniels' "99-Year Blues" and Carter Family's "John Hardy Was a Desperate Little Man."
Despite its bleak themes, it has been a reasonably popular song in concert, with 385 live performances, the latest in February 2017. A live version was released on the album Live/1975–85. During a September 22, 1984 Born in the U.S.A. Tour concert in Pittsburgh, Springsteen used the introduction to "Johnny 99" to respond to President Reagan referencing the message of hope in Bruce Springsteen's songs, stating "The president was mentioning my name the other day, and I kinda got to wondering what his favorite album musta been. I don't think it was the Nebraska album. I don't think he's been listening to this one."
Other artists have recorded "Johnny 99." Most famously, Johnny Cash recorded it along with another Nebraska song, "Highway Patrolman" for an album Cash entitled Johnny 99. The song has also been recorded for Bruce Springsteen covers albums by John Hiatt and Los Lobos. Punk rock band The Loved Ones covered the song on their EP, Distractions. Mark Erelli and Jeffrey Foucault also covered the song for Seven Curses, an album of murder ballads. The band Shovels & Rope covered the song as well and perform it occasionally live. It was also released as B-side of a 2006 single by UK rock band Mystic Knights of The Sea. The A-side of this single was an earlier Springsteen tune, "Cadillac Ranch."
Critical reception
In praising the album Nebraska, "Johnny 99" is one of the songs that was singled out by Mikal Gilmore of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner. In discussing Springsteen's growth as a writer, he stated that "When Springsteen tells Charlie Starkweather and Johnny 99's tales, he neither seeks their redemption nor asks for our judgment. He tells the stories about as simply and as well as they deserve to be told - or about as unsparingly as we deserve to hear them - and he lets us feel for them what we can, or find in them what we can of ourselves."
Though never released as a single anywhere, "Johnny 99" garnered enough album oriented rock airplay to reach #50 on the U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

Rosalind Mary Owens (born 12 November 1944), known as Tuppy Owens, is an English sex therapist, consultant, campaigner, writer and former adult model.
Education
Born in Cambridge, Owens gained a degree in zoology from Exeter University, and then worked in ecology in Africa and Trinidad. She settled in London, and worked as a scientific administrator at the Natural Environment Research Council. Then, in the late 1960s, she established a sex education book publishing company, for which she wrote and published The Sex Maniac's Diary successfully between 1972 and 1995, and which she operated as a thriving business from her Mayfair flat — for example, the 1975 Sex Maniac's Diary was launched in August 1974 with a reception at the Bristol Hotel in London which was reported on the following day in the Financial Times.
Work
From 1974, Owens also began lecturing on the subject of sex. In 1975, she appeared in the Dutch pornographic film Sensations. From 1984, the Sex Maniac's Diary was published as The Safer Sex Maniac's Diary and provided the first visual instructions to the public on how to put a condom on securely; it also reviewed condoms and offered safer sex advice, all at the beginning of the outbreak of HIV.
In 1979, Owens started the Outsiders Club for socially and physically disabled people to find partners. She was helped by Nigel Verbeek, who had recently lost his sight. Both worked voluntarily, which Owens continues to do today. Outsiders is a club providing peer support to members, an online Clubhouse, and monthly lunches around the country.
In order to ensure that she answered the members' questions with accuracy, Owens trained as a sex therapist at St George's Hospital Medical School in London, where she gained a diploma in Human Sexuality in 1986. She was also subsequently awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the Institute of Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in San Francisco. In 2009, Owens was named one of the Family Planning Association's 80 most influential achievers in the field of family planning.
For disabled men and women who want to learn what pleasures their bodies are capable of enjoying, and how to please a partner, Owens set up the TLC Trust website, where they can find responsible, safe sexual services.
In 1981, Owens appeared in the English pornographic film Lady Victoria's Training, which was produced by Mike Freeman/Videx and featured Simon Lindsay Honey, who went on to work as a porn producer and actor under the pseudonym Ben Dover.
In the 1990s, after more than 30 years living in London, Owens moved to a croft in the north of Scotland.
In 2005, Owens founded the Sexual Health and Disability Alliance (SHADA) to bring together health professionals interested in sex and disability. In November 2009, a conference with the title "Disability: Sex, Relationships and Pleasure" was held by SHADA with the Royal Society of Medicine. Owens produced the Sexual Respect Tool Kit, and started the sexual advocacy service, ASAP. She also answers the Sex and Disability Helpline. Her book "Supporting Disabled People with their Sexual Lives" was published by Jessica Kingsley on 19 November 2014.
Owens remains active in running Outsiders. At the same time, she also advises the promoter of the Sexual Freedom Ball to fund Outsiders, and the organisers of the fundraiser, The Erotic Awards, now called The Sexual Services and Entertainment Awards.
Owens is now the chair of the Sexual Freedom Coalition. Back in the 90s Owens worked campaigning with Prostitution Pride, parades through London, which were funded by Arcadia events in North London.
Owens has been working with Designability (formerly the Bath Institute of Medical Engineering) in the hope that they will be able to create sex toys that can be used by disabled people who, without them, cannot masturbate.
Owens will be the editor of a forthcoming website, The School of Sex for Disabled People, which is being created by sexually experienced disabled people and those who provide them with sexual services. She is currently writing her autobiography.
Award
Owens has won the 2015 Lifetime Achievement Award from the European Lifestyles Awards. She is also a Winner of the Innovation Award of Sexual Health and Human Rights UNESCO 2015.
She was a finalist (Lifetime Achievement) in the Directory of Social Change Awards 2015.

The Kölner Zeitschrift für Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie (Cologne Journal for Sociology and Social Psychology) is a German academic journal for sociology. It has an empirical focus on social research, both qualitatively and quantitatively, often in the tradition of Max Weber's "Verstehende Soziologie" (Interpretive Sociology). Articles are usually published in German with an abstract in English.
History
The journal's roots go back to the Kölner Vierteljahreshefte für Sozialwissenschaften (Cologne Quarterly of Social Sciences), founded in 1921 by the German sociologist Leopold von Wiese. After World War II it was again von Wiese who refounded the journal as ”Kölner Zeitschrift für Soziologie” in 1948. Under his successor René König, the quarterly soon expanded to social psychological subjects, which was reflected by the once again changed name.

The 2013 FAI Women's Cup Final was the final match of the 2013 FAI Women's Cup, the national association football Cup of the Republic of Ireland. The match took place on 3 November 2013 at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. Raheny United and Castlebar Celtic contested the match.
The match was shown live on RTÉ2 and RTÉ2 HD in Ireland and was refereed by Marie Ward, assisted by Deirdre Nolan and Olivia Syned with Natasha Valenti as Fourth Official. The Referee Observer was Victor Loughman.
Raheny United won the Cup to retain the trophy they won for the first time the previous year. Underdogs Castlebar Celtic equalised twice to force extra time but were unable to come back a third time after conceding an own goal.
Background
The two managers were already acquainted, as Raheny's Terry Eviston had previously been in charge of Athlone Town when Castlebar's Adrian Carberry had been a player at the League of Ireland club.
Carberry was barred from the technical area at the Aviva Stadium because he was an employee of the Football Association of Ireland. His request for a one-off dispensation was refused, so he took his place in the stand and his assistant Maz Sweeney directed operations from pitch-side.
All the Castlebar Celtic players wore the name Jeremy on the back of their shirts, as a mark of respect to their former manager Jeremy Dee whose untimely death occurred in November 2012.
As Cup holders, reigning Women's National League champions and undefeated League-leaders, Raheny United entered the match as strong favourites. Two weeks previously they had beaten Castlebar Celtic's comparatively youthful team 9–2 in a League fixture.
Castlebar Celtic were without Shauna Jackson due to an injured ankle. Deirdre Doherty had missed recent fixtures while attending college in England, but Castlebar retained her registration and she agreed to come back to play in the match. Seana Cooke had agreed a transfer from Raheny United to Durham in the week leading up to the match.
Match
Summary
As the match was played as a curtain raiser to the 2013 FAI Cup Final between Drogheda United and Sligo Rovers, it began with a "small crowd" of around 200 which expanded to a reported attendance of 17,573 in time for the men's final.
Raheny took control of possession in the early exchanges and forced Castlebar's 16-year-old goalkeeper Caoimhe O'Reilly into action. Raheny took the lead after 37 minutes when Ciara Grant hit a half volley over O'Reilly and into the net.
Castlebar continued to yield the territorial advantage but tried to hit Raheny on the break, usually through their skilful playmaker Emma Hansberry. On 67 minutes Sarah Rowe made a foray up the right wing and found Hansberry, who played the ball inside for substitute Emma Mullin to score the equaliser.
On 84 minutes Raheny went back ahead when Caroline Thorpe was controversially adjudged to have been fouled by Castlebar's young goalkeeper, and scored the resultant penalty kick herself. Castlebar equalised again in the last minute of normal time, when another substitute Deirdre Doherty fired a powerful long-range shot past Niamh Reid Burke.
The standard 15-minutes each-way of extra-time was unexpectedly abridged to ten minutes each-way. Five minutes into the additional period Castlebar's centre-back Kim Flood inadvertently headed Siobhán Killeen's cross past O'Reilly and into her own goal. The luckless Flood was later carried off with an injury, replaced by Rachel Kearns.
During the presentation of the trophy to victorious Raheny captain Becky Creagh, Sligo Rovers players intruded on the pitch to begin their warm up.
Experienced midfielder Caroline Thorpe was named Player of the Match by RTÉ summariser Susan Ronan. Thorpe later revealed that she had been bereaved by the death of her brother and was in the grip of anorexia nervosa at the time.

The Rolls-Royce Goshawk was a development of the Rolls-Royce Kestrel that used evaporative or steam cooling. In line with Rolls-Royce convention of naming piston engines after birds of prey, it was named after the goshawk.
The engine first ran in 1933 and provided 660 horsepower (490 kW). Only a few engines were built as the aircraft designs intended to use it were not adopted by the Royal Air Force. The Goshawk was used to power the Short Knuckleduster, the Supermarine Type 224 (a predecessor to the Supermarine Spitfire) and other prototype aircraft.
Design and development
The Goshawk was developed from the Kestrel IV prototype engine, to use evaporative (also known as "steam") cooling. Rather than keep the cooling liquid below its boiling point in the cooling system, the coolant was allowed to boil; the phase change from liquid to vapour takes more heat from the engine, so less weight of coolant is needed. However, the radiator had to be bulkier to accommodate coolant in its gas phase, which increased drag.
Twenty engines were built, and flew only in prototypes as a few manufacturers' private ventures and "one-offs". Powers for individual installations are quoted between 650 and . Problems with coolant leaks, coolant pumping and the realisation that large wing-mounted condensing radiators would be vulnerable to combat damage caused the project to be cancelled, although valuable lessons had been learned and were put to good use with development of the later Merlin.
Variants
Goshawk I
(1932) Developed from the prototype Kestrel IV.
Goshawk II
(1935) 600 hp. Lowered propeller reduction gear ratio.
Goshawk III
(1935) 600hp. Further reduction of gear ratio.
Goshawk VI
660 hp. High ratio reduction gear.
Goshawk VII
660 hp. Raised reduction gear ratio.
Goshawk VIII
660 hp. Special experimental engine. Maximum power output: 837 hp.
Applications
The Goshawk was the power unit specified for the twin-engined Short Knuckleduster flying boat (K3574) to Specification R24/31 and "preferred" for submissions to Air Ministry specification F7/30 for a fighter aircraft. Goshawks were used by all three officially sponsored prototypes, the Supermarine Type 224 (K2890),the Westland F.7/30 (K2891) and the Blackburn F3 (K2892), which only taxied with the Goshawk fitted and did not fly, in addition to two private venture entrants, the Bristol Type 123 and the Hawker P.V.3.
The Goshawk also powered Hawker's privately developed "High Speed Fury Mk 2" (K3586) and "Intermediate Fury" 2" (the latter Hawker's own development aircraft and "hack" serial G-ABSE) and the Westland Pterodactyl V (K2770) and was installed for trials in the Gloster TSR.38 (S1705), and the first Gloster Gnatsnapper prototype (N227).

Amber or Amer, is a city near Jaipur city in Jaipur district in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It is now a part of the Jaipur Municipal Corporation.
The picturesque situation of Amber at the mouth of a rocky mountain gorge, in which nestles a lake, has attracted the admiration of travellers, including Victor Jacquemont and Reginald Heber. It is seen to be a remarkable example for its combined Rajput-Mughal architecture. The Amber Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the top tourist attraction in the Jaipur area.
History
The state of Jaipur was earlier known as Amber or Dhundhar and was controlled by Meena chiefs of five different tribes who were under suzerainty of the Bargurjar Rajput Raja of Deoti. Later a Kachhwaha prince Dulha Rai destroyed the sovereignty of Meenas and also defeated Bargurjars of Deoli and took Dhundhar fully under Kachwaha rule.
Much of the present structure known as Amber Fort is actually the palace built by Raja Man Singh I who ruled from 1590 to 1614 AD. The palace includes several spectacular buildings, such as the Diwan-i-Khas, and the elaborately painted Ganesh Pole built by the renowned warlord Mirza Raja Jai Singh I (Man Singh I's grandson). The old and original fort of Amber, dating from earlier Rajas or the Mair or Maidh period, is what is known in the present day as Jaigarh Fort, which was actually the main defensive structure rather than the palace itself. The two structures are interconnected by a series of encompassing fortifications.
Amber was capital of the Kachwaha until 1727 when the ruler of Amber, Sawai Jai Singh II founded a capital Jainagara (Jaipur), named after him, about nine kilometers south of Amber. After the founding of this new town, the royal palace and houses of prominent persons were shifted to Jaipur. The priests of Shila Devi temple, who were Bengali Brahmins, continued to live in the fort (to this date), while the Jaigarh fort above the palace also remained heavily garrisoned. The capital of Kachwaha was supplanted by the modern city of Jaipur, which is the capital of the Rajasthan state in India.
Controversy over renovation practices
Poor site management and development pressures have dramatically altered the historical integrity of Amber. The building that rings around the Jaleb Chwok courtyard "has been converted to a marketplace with shops selling showpieces and dresses. They have cafeterias, cybercafés, etc.", according to the Times of India. In the summer of 2009, the Rajasthan High Court launched a three-member panel charged with investigating the controversial renovations and determining to what extent the cultural heritage of the site was compromised.

Schinia acutilinea, the angled gem or acute-lined flower moth, is a moth of the family Noctuidae. The species was first described by Augustus Radcliffe Grote in 1878. It is found in the dry southern portions of Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia, south across the plains and Great Basin to southern Arizona and California.
The wingspan is 25–27 mm. Adults are on wing in August.
The larvae feed on Artemisia species, including Artemisia tridentata and Artemisia nova.
Schinia acutilinea was placed as a synonym of Schinia accessa by David F. Hardwick in 1996, but recent research by Michael G. Pogue indicates several species are included under this name.

Aéroplanes Voisin was a French aircraft manufacturing company established in 1905 by Gabriel Voisin and his brother Charles, and was continued by Gabriel after Charles died in an automobile accident in 1912; the full official company name then became Société Anonyme des Aéroplanes G. Voisin ().
During World War I, it was a major producer of military aircraft, notably the Voisin III. After the war Gabriel Voisin abandoned the aviation industry, and set up a company to design and produce luxury automobiles, called Avions Voisin.
Early History
Gabriel Voisin had been employed by Ernest Archdeacon to work on the construction of gliders and then entered into partnership with Louis Blériot, to form the company Ateliers d' Aviation Edouard Surcouf, Blériot et Voisin in 1905. Following a disagreement, Gabriel Voisin bought out Blériot and on 5 November 1906 established the Appareils d'Aviation Les Frères Voisin with his brother Charles (). The company, based in the Parisian suburb of Billancourt, was the first commercial aircraft factory in the world.
It created Europe's first manned, heavier-than-air powered aircraft capable of a sustained (1 km), circular, controlled flight, including take-off and landing, the Voisin-Farman I.
Having learned to fly with a Voisin, on 8 March 1910, Raymonde de Laroche became the first woman to receive a pilot licence when the Aéro-Club de France issued her licence #36.
In South Africa, on 28 December 1909, French aviator Albert Kimmerling made the first manned, heavier-than-air powered flight in Africa in a Voisin 1907 biplane.
Like many early aircraft companies, Voisin built machines to the designs of their customers which helped support their own experiments. The company's first customers were a M. Florencie, who commissioned them to build an ornithopter he had designed, and Henri Kapferer, for whom they built a pusher biplane of their own design. The latter was underpowered, having a Buchet engine of only , and it failed to fly. However, Kapferer introduced them to Leon Delagrange, for whom they built a similar machine, powered by a Antoinette engine. This was first successfully flown by Charles Voisin on 30 March 1907, achieving a straight-line flight of . In turn Delagrange introduced them to Henri Farman, who ordered an identical aircraft. These two aircraft are often referred to by their owners' names as the Voisin-Delagrange No.1 and the Voisin-Farman No.1, and were the foundation of the company's success. On 13 January 1908 Farman used his aircraft to win the "Grand Prix de l'aviation" offered by Ernest Archdeacon and Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe for the first closed-circuit flight of over a kilometer. Since the Wright Brothers would provide no evidence of their own accomplishments, they were widely disbelieved at the time, so this was a major breakthrough in the conquest of the air, and brought Voisin many orders for similar aircraft. Around sixty would be built.

Voisin designs in World War I
Production of the Voisin III Type LA and LAS increased with the outbreak of the First World War, with examples being built under licence in Italy by S.I.T., in Russia by Anatra, Breshnev-Moller, Dux Lebedev and Schetinin, and in the UK by Savages of King's Lynn, with production exceeding 1,350 airframes. Examples would also be used by the Belgian and Romanian Air Services, and a few even survived the war to be used in Ukraine, and in Russia. Soon after the outbreak of the First World War, it became apparent that the French aviation industry could not produce aircraft in sufficient numbers to meet military requirements. Manufacturers from various other fields became aviation subcontractors, and later license-builders as did many smaller aircraft manufacturers who had been unable to secure orders for their own designs. By 1918, Voisin was involved with the Voisin-Lafresnaye company, a major constructor of airframes, and the Voisin-Lefebvre company, a major builder of aircraft engines.
The Voisin III was followed by a small number of the 37mm cannon armed Voisin IV Type LB and Type LBS. The B in the factory designations indicate that the airframe was equipped with a cannon, although some had it removed in service. The S indicates that the engine was raised (surélevé) compared to the original installation.
Three hundred of the improved Voisin V Type LAS aircraft followed.
The Voisin VI Type LAS was a development of the V fitted with a Salmson radial, of which only around 50 were built despite the improved performance as the basic type was considered to be obsolete.
The larger Type LC, Voisin VII, followed in 1916 with the engine cooling radiators moved to the nose, but was not a success as it was badly underpowered and only a hundred of these were built.
Voisin built a large Triplane powered by four Salmson water-cooled aero-engines in 1915 with twin superimposed fuselage booms, however it attracted no orders, but its wings were reused in 1916 for the E.28 triplane bomber which was now powered by four V8 Hispano-Suiza 8B engines, which likewise failed to secure any orders.
Also in 1915, Voisin built the Type M in which the fuselage was below the lower wing, and the engine filled the gap between the wings, however neither it, nor the otherwise similar twin fuselage Type O were successful.
Following the Voisin VII came the more powerful, and more successful Voisin VIII Type LAP and Type LBP. This was the French army's main night bomber in 1916 and 1917, with over one thousand built.
The Voisin IX, or Type LC (the designation was reused), was an unsuccessful lightened development of the VIII for a reconnaissance aeroplane, which lost out to the Salmson 2 and Breguet 14.
The Voisin X, Type LAR and Type LBR, was the Voisin VIII with a more reliable, lighter and more powerful Renault 12Fe engine in place of the Peugeot 8Aa used on the VIII. Deliveries were severely delayed, but some nine hundred were built before the end of the war. In 1918, a Voisin X (No. 3500) was used to create the Voisin 'Aerochir' ('Ambulance'). The aircraft was capable of flying a surgeon, together with an operating table and support equipment, including an x-ray machine and autoclave, into the battlefield. Under-wing panniers could be carried of equipment. Another X was converted into a drone, and flown in 1918 and again in 1923.
The Voisin XI was a development of the X powered by a Panhard 12Bc, with a slightly longer wingspan and assorted detail changes. Only about 10 were built and it did not see service.
The final Voisin design, the Voisin XII, was successful in trials in 1918 for the BN2 bomber competition, but with the end of the war, no production was ordered. The Voisin XII was a large, four-engined biplane night bomber. Several projects for heavy bombers for the next bomber specification (BN3/4) may have been based on the XII, but fitted with larger Salmson or Hispano-Suiza engines, but were not built.
In the 1930s, a glider was built by a Louis Voisin, however he had no connection to Gabriel Voisin.
Post World War I
After 1918, Gabriel Voisin abandoned the aviation industry in favor of automobile construction under the name Avions Voisin.

Italian pilots started to face P-38s from late 1942 and these fighters, with their long range, high speed and powerful weaponry, were quickly established as a more dangerous foe than the previously used Supermarine Spitfire. A few P-38s fell into the hands of Germans and Italians, and, differently from captured Spitfires, these aircraft were tested and used in combat. P-38s were pitted against nearly all of the fighters in the Italian arsenal in tests at Guidonia and apparently, it fared well. Col. Tondi used a P-38, probably an 'E' version, that landed, because a navigation error, in Sardinia. Tondi then claimed at least 1 B-24 in his captured P-38, downed 11 August 1943. Shortly before Tondi attacked the bomber, an Italian Macchi MC.202 or 205 attacked, doing little damage. However, the heavy armament of P-38 proved devastating, indeed.

After the war, Italy received 100, or according to other sources, 120, dismantled ex-USAAF P-38s, in an agreement dated April 1946. Seven of these airframes were not rebuilt but were reserved for use as spares. The remaining 93, after a one-month refurbishment by IMM (Aerfer), were first issued to the 3rd Stormo in Bari and Lecce, in Apulia. They were a mix of P-38L fighters and PR conversions, including F-5E, G and H models. Six P-38s were modified as dual-control training craft, a version which had a separate cockpit with duplicated controls forward of the standard cockpit, in a lengthened nose. These unique training machines, which served with the SCOT (Scuola Caccia Ogni Tempo, meaning fighter school for all weather conditions) in Lecce and Foggia, were identified as P-38DC (Dual Control).
The heavy fighters flew reconnaissance missions over the Balkans, as well as ground attack, naval cooperation and air superiority missions.
Italian P-38s made their operational debut on 9 September 1948, when a single F-5 took photographs of objectives in the Balkans.
Because of the big dimensions of this fighter, the old engines, and pilot errors, a very high number of P-38s were lost in accidents. At least thirty crashes of P-38s in Italian service claimed a number of victims. Despite this, many Italian pilots liked the fighter, due to its excellent visibility on the ground and its stability at take off. The P-38s were finally phased-out in Italy in 1956. Today, no Italian P-38s survive, nor even a single component from one, as these aircraft, because of the high value of their light alloys, were quickly recycled for their metal content.

Tannery Falls is a waterfall on Tannery Creek located near the city of Munising, Michigan. The Falls are also sometimes called the Rudy M. Olson Memorial Falls. The grave site of Rudolf Olsen can be seen on the path leading to the falls alongside a set of stairs. Tannery Creek flows behind a small residential area before reaching The falls which drop into an impressive sandstone canyon. There is a cave behind the falls. The level of water coming over the falls can vary greatly depending on snow melt or rainfall. Tannery Falls is one of the less-advertised and less-maintained falls in the area. For a number of years, the falls were under private ownership. The land around the area was purchased by the Michigan Nature Association which created a public nature preserve that includes the nearby Memorial Falls.

The 2013–14 Central Coast Mariners FC season was the club's ninth season since its establishment in 2004, and included the 2013–14 A-League season as well as the 2014 AFC Champions League.
After their second placing in the A-League Premiership behind debutantes Western Sydney Wanderers followed by their maiden Championship (also against the Wanderers), the Mariners finished their previous season in the Round of 16 of the AFC Champions League – their best ever result in the continental competition, including their first win away in Asia against K-League side Suwon Bluewings.
Despite the retirement of central defender Patrick Zwaanswijk and the departure of goalkeeper Mathew Ryan, attacking midfielder Oliver Bozanic, striker Bernie Ibini-Isei and right back Pedj Bojić during the pre-season — and continued departures during the season, including Head Coach Graham Arnold and Head of Sports Science Andrew Clark — the Mariners came close to repeating that success, finishing third in the 2013–14 A-League and reaching the semi-final against Western Sydney Wanderers along with narrowly missing out on reaching the Round of 16 of the Champions League.
Season overview
May 2013
Following an injury-plagued stint at K-League side Chunnam Dragons which subsequently saw that club grant him a release early in 2013, Matt Simon re-signed with the Mariners on a one-year contract on 16 May.
Citing increasing physical and mental stress associated with the constant commute between his home and personal training business in Sydney and the Mariners' home base on the Central Coast, Pedj Bojić sought and was subsequently granted a release from the final year of his contract with effect from 24 May. Bojić subsequently signed with Sydney FC on 19 June.
Having been linked with a number of European clubs during the January transfer window, goalkeeper Mathew Ryan signed a 3-year deal with Belgian Pro League club Club Brugge on 30 May, in the process turning down an offer from Danish Superliga side Randers.
June 2013
After trialling with Club Brugge during the January transfer window and with French Ligue 1 side Lille after the Grand Final, Bernie Ibini-Isei signed a 3-year deal with Chinese Super League newcomers Shanghai SIPG on 4 June.

Karl Hudspith (born 31 March 1988 in Hammersmith, London), is a British rower and scientist. Hudspith competed in four Boat Races from 2011 to 2014 for Oxford, and was a member of the winners' team on three occasions. Hudspith competed for Great Britain in rowing at Junior, Under-23, Student, and Senior levels and is a two time World University Rowing Champion. He completed his PhD at the University of Oxford where he developed a next-generation sequencing based diagnostic test for inherited retinal degeneration before beginning a legal career in American intellectual property law in Washington DC.
Rowing career
Hudspith learned to row at Hampton School Boat Club, where he represented Great Britain in his final year at the 2006 Junior World Championships. Hudspith would go on to represent Great Britain at the 2008, 2009, and 2010 World Rowing U23 Championships, the 2013 World Rowing Cup, and the 2010 and 2014 FISU World University Rowing Championships.
Hudspith was in the five seat of the winning Oxford Blue boat at the 2011 Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race. For the 2012 season Hudspith was elected president of the Oxford University Boat Club, and rowed in the five seat during the controversial 2012 Boat race which was disrupted by a protester. Hudspith rowed in the six seat for the 2013 boat race, which Oxford won by a length and a half. Hudspith competed in his fourth boat race in 2014 in the three seat, winning by eleven lengths, the largest winning margin in 41 years.

Colloquium Marianum was an elite type of Marian sodality, founded by Jesuit Father Jakob Rem of the Jesuit Seminary at Ingolstadt in 1594 AD in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, with the aim to reach holiness of life through an ever-deeper love of the Virgin Mary.
Description
Membership in the Colloquium Marianum, an elite group within the Sodality of Our Lady, was based on a virtuous life, free of cardinal sins. Daily masses in front of the picture of the Mater ter admirabilis and weekly meetings and discussions under her picture were to assist the members in apostolic fervor and a spiritual Marian lifestyle. The congregation was approved in 1612 by Pope Paul V and thereafter, Father Rem admitted 400 new members. During the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), the Colloquium Marianum contributed to the prayerful defence of the faith with thousands of male members. Being an elite organization, it included well-known members from politics and Church politics at that time. During the Age of Enlightenment, and after the Jesuit Order was outlawed by Pope Clement XIV in 1773, the colloquium lost membership and gradually disappeared. The Schönstatt movement and the Legion of Mary resurrected the idea of Father Rem successfully in the 20th century.

Charles-Victor Sieg (8 August 1837 – 6 April 1899) was a French composer and organist. He won the 1864 Prix de Rome for his setting of the dramatic cantata, Ivanhoé.
Life and career
Sieg was born in Turckheim, a small town in the Alsace region of France. His father, Constant Sieg (1807 – 1891), was a composer and the organist of the Church of Saint-Martin in Colmar. Sieg studied first under his father and then at the Conservatoire de Paris under François Benoist (organ) and Ambroise Thomas (composition). He won the conservatory's First Prize in organ in 1863, and the following year he won the Prix de Rome for the cantata, Ivanhoé set to a French text by Victor Roussy based on Walter Scott's 1820 novel, Ivanhoe. The cantata premiered on 18 November 1864 at the Paris Opera with Jean Morère in the title role and was well received.
Ivanhoé proved to be Sieg's only major composition, although he later published several piano pieces including Trois Impromptus, Tarentelle and Caprice-Valse. After he returned from Rome where he had worked on composing an opéra-comique, he took up a post in Paris as organist at the church of Notre-Dame de Clignancourt and devoted himself to teaching. He also served as the organist of the Church of Saint-Merri and as the singing inspector for Paris city schools. Sieg died in Colmar in 1899 at the age of 61. Rue Victor Sieg, a street in Turckheim, is named in his honour.

The Gta language (also Gataʔ, Gtaʔ, Gata; also known as Gta Asa, Didei or Didayi , Dire) is an Austroasiatic language spoken by the Didayi people of southernmost Odisha in India. It is notable for its sesquisyllabic phonology and vigesimal numeral system.
Demographics
Gta is spoken by 3,000 people primarily in Malkangiri district, Odisha as well as adjoining areas of Koraput district. According to Anderson (2008), it is spoken by less than 4,500 people.
Ethnologue reports the following locations.
Odisha (47 villages): Kudumulgumma block and Chitrakonda block of Koraput district and Malkangiri district, south of Bondo Hills; some in Khairput block
East Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh
Classification and dialects
The Gta language belongs to the South Munda subgroup of the Munda branch of the Austroasiatic language family. Within South Munda, Gta is generally considered to be the first branch off a node that also subsumes the Remo and Gutob languages; this subgroup of South Munda is known as Gutob–Remo–Gataq. It is phonologically and morphologically divergent within that branch.
Gta has two main varieties, namely Plains Gta and Hill Gta.
Phonology
Gta' has the 5 canonical vowels /a, e, i, o, u/, and sometimes a sixth vowel /æ/. To this can be added several nasalized counterparts: /ã, õ, ũ/ and sometimes /ĩ/. Gta' has the following consonants:
Grammar
Nouns
Nouns in Gtaʔ are primarily marked for case, number and possession. Nouns also have two forms, one a free full form, the other a bound short form. These latter occur only when the noun is compounded with another noun or a verb for derivational purposes, and are hence labeled "combining forms". The combining form usually involves removing an affix or shortening the noun in some way. Some examples:
ncu -> -cu- (oil)
gsi -> -si- (louse)
gbe -> -be- (bear)
gnar -> -gar- (strip of bamboo)
remwa -> -re- (person)
Combining forms occurring with verb stems can be echoed independently of the verb stems; those occurring with noun stems either remain intact or change at par with the main stems.
Examples
Type 1: sur-cu to fry in oil > sur-ca, sur-ci, sar-ca, s?r-cf, sar-cu.
gag-bo? to tie onto the head
gag-ba?, gig-bT?, gag-bT?, gTg-ba?, gig-bo?.
"tur-t?a to graze cattle >
tar-ti, t?r-ti, tar-t?a, t?r-t?a.
Type 2: kula-re kinsman >
ka I a-re, k?I i-re.
sari-ja paddy flower >
sara-ja, s?ri-j?, si ri-ja.
ra-ko peacock feather >
bara-ka, bir?-k?, bir?-ko.
ult-so mango wood >
ala-sa, ?l?-sf, ala-so, Mi-so.
huQ-be baby bear >
har?-ba, h?tj-b?, harj-be, h?n-be.
Echo formation
Rules of formation
Rule# 1. Echo-words are formed by changing only the vowels of the base word.
Rule# 2. The echo-word must differ from the base word. The vowel of univocalic base words is reflected as either /a/ or /}/ in the echo-word. For base-word /u, e, o/ the vowel /a/ is preferred, while for base word /e/ the vowel /I/ is preferred.
Rule# 3. The vowels of disyllabic base words are reflected in the echo-word as follows:
a. Both vowels are reflected as either /a/ or /?/; or
b. Only one of the base-word vowels is reflected as /a/ or /]/ while the other is reflected unchanged; or
c. The first vowel (Vl) changes to /u/ while the second (V^) changes to /a/.
Rule# 4. In the case of trisyllabic base words, one, two or all three of the vowels (in adjacent syllables) are reflected as either /a/ or /}/.
Rule# 5. The echo-forms of compound words, irrespective of their vocalic structure, are derived as follows:
a. In the case of compound verbs consisting of two verb stems, one or both stems undergo change, depending on their relationship with each other;
b. Nominal combining forms occurring with verb stems change independently; those attached to noun stems change only at par with the main stem.
c. In verbal constructions incorporating a prefix, both the prefix and the stem change as a unit.
Categories of echo forms
A-forms, indicating gross variety;
I-forms, indicating diminutive or tender variety ;
U/a-forms, indicating variety different from a related category
Partially changed forms, indicating inferior variety : a-forms, indicating grossness and ?-forms, indicating tenderness.
Numeral system
Gta' numeral system is vigesimal.
Neighboring languages
Gtaʔ echo-formation shows some striking similarities with echo-formation in neighboring Munda languages such as Remo and Gorum as well as in the Desia dialect of Oriya spoken in the Koraput Munda region. The most conspicuous feature they have in common with Gtaʔ is that echo-words in all three of these languages are also derived from base words by changes in the vowels alone.

Arthur Lismer, LL. D. (27 June 1885 – 23 March 1969) was an English-Canadian painter, member of the Group of Seven and educator. He is known primarily as a landscape painter and for his paintings of ships in dazzle camouflage.
Early life
Lismer was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, England, the son of Harriet and Edward Lismer, a draper's buyer. At age thirteen, he apprenticed at a photo-engraving company. He was awarded a scholarship, and used this time to take evening classes at the Sheffield School of Art from 1898 until 1905. In 1905, he moved to Antwerp, Belgium, where he studied art at the Academie Royale.
Lismer immigrated to Canada in 1911, settled in Toronto, Ontario, and took a job with Grip Ltd.
Lismer's brother, Ted, remained in Sheffield and became a notable trade unionist and communist activist.
President of NSCAD University
From 1916 to 1919 Lismer served as the President of the Victoria College of Art in Nova Scotia (now NSCAD University).
Official war artist
In wartime Halifax, Lismer was inspired by the shipping and naval activity of the port, notably the dramatically painted dazzle camouflaged ships with their patterns of curved and zigzag lines designed to mislead
German U-boats and submarines. Lismer's work came to the attention of Lord Beaverbrook who arranged for Lismer to be commissioned as an official war artist. His best-known work from the war years depicted what he observed and learned about in Halifax, Nova Scotia: Mine sweeping, convoying, patrolling and harbor defense. Lismer completed a number of oil studies and finished several major canvases during 1918 and 1919. These included the large and ebullient Convoy in Bedford Basin (c.1919), which depicts merchant ships forming a transatlantic convoy near Halifax. He also did some sketches of the Halifax Explosion.
During his time as a war artist, he wrote a booklet for the Canadian Armed Services titled How to get started: Watercolor Painting for Pleasure.
Group of Seven
The collaboration of four artists at Grip gradually evolved into the Group of Seven, whose work was intended to contribute to the process of giving Canada a distinctive national voice in painting. He also worked with the cadre at Grip.
Arthur Lismer's style was influenced by his pre-Canadian experience (primarily in Antwerp), where he found the Barbizon and post-impressionist movements a key inspiration. Collaborating with the group of artists who would, in 1919, become the Group of Seven, Lismer exhibited the characteristic post-impressionist style, and spiritual connection with the landscape that would embody that group's work. Like the other members of the Group of Seven many of his works began as small en plein air sketches in oil on hardboard.
During the Centennial of the City of Toronto, in 1934, Lismer was on the Pictures Committee. His work in art education was effective; and this service to the wider community caused Lismer to become influential in ways not always achieved by his artist colleagues. For example, he started a children's art program at the Art Gallery of Toronto, which became successful in the 1930s. In 1936, as Lismer`s prominence in the field of art education involved him in international travels, he went on a one-year tour of South Africa. Together with art educator Norah McCullough, he organized art education programmes, lectured on Canadian art and gave workshops for teachers. On the trip, he painted extensively in watercolour.
He moved to Montreal in 1940, as a result of being given a teaching appointment at the Art Association of Montreal and established the MMFA School of Art and Design. He joined the McGill School of Architecture as a sessional lecturer in 1943 at the invitation of John Bland, the School's director, and was appointed assistant professor in 1945, retiring in 1955 at the age of seventy.
Between 1940 and 1950, he travelled in the summertime to the east coast of Canada to paint. He particularly liked to paint fishermen`s gear on the docks of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.
Several members of the Group of Seven including Lismer became members of the Canadian Group of Painters. In 1962, he received the Canada Council Medal for his contribution to Canadian art. In 1967, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.
Lismer died on March 23, 1969, in Montreal, Quebec, and was buried alongside other members of the original Seven at the McMichael Canadian Art Collection Grounds.
Legacy
In Toronto, Lismer Hall, the auditorium at Humberside Collegiate Institute is named in his honour. He painted one of the largest murals in Canada for the school during the 1930s that hangs on the auditorium's walls today.
Lismer has been designated as an Historic Person in the Directory of Federal Heritage Designations.

‘Negative Approach to Urban Planning', also known as "reversed planning" or simply "negative planning" is a landscape urbanism approach to urban planning. It is a new concept and terminology introduced by Chinese landscape architect, Professor of Peking University YU Kongjian. Yu argued that among other issues, the degrading environmental and ecological situations, low performance scrambled city form, and the loss of cultural identity in Beijing have proved that the conventional ‘population projection-urban infrastructure-land use' approach and the architectural urbanism approach to urban growth planning failed to meet the challenges of swift urbanisation and sustainability issues in China in general, and Beijing in particular. The negative approach defines an urban growth and urban form based on Ecological Infrastructure (EI). This approach has evolved from the pre-scientific model of Feng-shui as the sacred landscape setting for human settlement, the nineteenth century notion of greenways as urban recreational infrastructure, the early twentieth century idea of green belts as urban form makers, and the late twentieth century notion of ecological networks and EI as a biological preservation framework. EI is composed of critical landscape elements and structure that are strategically identified as Landscape Security Patterns to safeguard natural assets and ecosystems services, essential for sustaining human society. EI is strategically planned and developed using less land but more efficiently preserving the Ecosystem service. It distinguishes itself from other theories as it is a practical way of solving urban and rural planning problems in quickly developing regions.
Background
The negative approach is proposed by Yu in the degrading ecological background and chaos of city planning in China, especially big cities. This approach argues that when it comes to dealing with issues brought up by rapid urban development, the conventional ‘population speculation–land use–infrastructure layout' approach ‘has been proven invalid' and responsible for the ‘chaotic situation and degrading ecological conditions' and ‘loss of cultural and spiritual landscape' in Chinese cities like Beijing and Shenzhen. So Yu raises an ecological planning methodology which gives priority to planning of EI (ecological infrastructure), and tries to ‘provide land use and urban planning with a solid ecological basis'.
Theory
The negative approach is based on both eastern and western ecological planning theories, especially the McHarg's theory of Design with Nature and Landscape Urbanism. The Landscape Urbanism takes landscape rather than architecture as the ‘basic building block or urbanism'. It can be understood as the contrary of Architecture Urbanism, which uses buildings, road networks and other constructions to define urban forms. Yu said in an interview during the 2009 China Landscape Architecture Education Conference & Landscape Architects Conference that he considers the negative approach ‘the Chinese version of Landscape Urbanism'. The negative approach mainly focuses on landscape as its operation field, meaning to use landscape, rather than the architectures or other constructions as the infrastructure to shape urban form. The key for negative approach is planning in Ecological Infrastructure.
Objective
Facing the challenges in today's Chinese urban planning, Yu discusses about the ethic of land use in China and referred the land as Chinese gods, he argues that we should ‘go back to earth' and let the ‘god of earth' come back to life in his book Negative Planning Method. He points out that the core of planning in Chinese cities should be sustainability for development on limited land. And this is what negative planning should care about. Its purpose is to develop land while maintaining the ecological integrity and cultural identity, to shape landscape form and urban form in a sustainable way. ‘The overall objectives are smart preservation and smart growth'.
Method
To accomplish these goals, negative approach consists of the following steps:
1) Process analysis: Using software and tools like GIS to systematically analyze landscapes for ecosystem functions or services which are targeted to be safeguarded by EI. This step includes: Abiotic processes, Biotic processes and Cultural processes.
2) Defining landscape SPs: SP refers to Landscape Security Patterns that are composed of strategic portions and positions of the landscape that have critical significance in safeguarding and controlling certain ecological processes. Components of security patterns have the quality of initiative, coordination and efficiency, and are, therefore, strategically important in landscape change.
3) Defining EI: The SPs are integrated by overlaying techniques to form comprehensive Ecological Infraestructure at variety levels: high, medium, low.
4) Defining urban form: In this step, we can develop scenarios of regional urban growth patterns by ‘using the multiple EI alternatives as framing structures'. The decision makers of the city now can evaluate from economical, ecological and social aspects and pick from the scenarios.

In magnetic confinement fusion, quasisymmetry (sometimes hyphenated as quasi-symmetry) is a type of continuous symmetry in the magnetic field strength of a stellarator. Quasisymmetry is desired, as Noether's theorem implies that there exists a conserved quantity in such cases. This conserved quantity ensures that particles stick to the flux surface, resulting in better confinement and neoclassical transport.
It is currently unknown if it is mathematically possible to construct a quasi-symmetric magnetic field which upholds magnetohydrodynamic force balance, which is required for stability. There are stellarator designs which are very close to being quasisymmetric, and it is possible to find solutions by generalizing the magnetohydrodynamic force balance equation. Quasisymmetric systems are a subset of omnigenous systems. The Helically Symmetric eXperiment and the National Compact Stellarator Experiment are designed to be quasisymmetric.

The Piano Concerto No. 2 in B major, Op. 83, by Johannes Brahms is separated by a gap of 22 years from his first piano concerto. Brahms began work on the piece in 1878 and completed it in 1881 while in Pressbaum near Vienna. It took him three years to work on this concerto which indicates that he was always self-critical. He wrote to Clara Schumann: "I want to tell you that I have written a very small piano concerto with a very small and pretty scherzo." Ironically, he was describing a huge piece. This concerto is dedicated to his teacher, Eduard Marxsen. The public premiere of the concerto was given in Budapest on 9 November 1881, with Brahms as soloist and the Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra, and was an immediate success. He proceeded to perform the piece in many cities across Europe.
Composition
The piece is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets (B), 2 bassoons, 4 horns (initially 2 in B bass, 2 in F), 2 trumpets (B), timpani (B and F, A and D in second movement) and strings. (The trumpets and timpani are used only in the first two movements, which is unusual.)
The piece is in four movements, rather than the three typical of concertos in the Classical and Romantic periods:
The additional movement results in a concerto considerably longer than most other concertos written up to that time, with typical performances lasting around 50 minutes. Upon its completion, Brahms sent its score to his friend, the surgeon and violinist Theodor Billroth to whom Brahms had dedicated his first two string quartets, describing the work as "some little piano pieces." Brahms even described the stormy scherzo as a "little wisp of a scherzo."
Description
The work opens with the following horn call, which provides much of the thematic material for the first movement:
Allegro non troppo
The first movement is in the concerto variant of sonata form. The main theme is introduced by the horn solo, with the piano interceding. The woodwind instruments proceed to introduce a small motif (borrowed, perhaps unconsciously, from the opening of the first movement of his Serenade No. 2) before an unusually placed cadenza appears. The full orchestra repeats the theme and introduces more motifs in the orchestral exposition. The piano and orchestra work together to develop these themes in the piano exposition before the key changes to F minor (from F major, the dominant) and the piano plays a powerful and difficult section before the next orchestral tutti appears. The development, like many such sections in the Classical period, works its way from the dominant key back to the tonic while heavily developing themes. At the beginning of the recapitulation, the theme is replayed before a differing transition is heard, returning to the music heard in the piano exposition (this time in B major/minor). A coda appears after the minor key section, finishing off this movement.
One motif repeated in the development has been noted by musicologists as bearing similarity to Battle Hymn of the Republic and Say, Brothers, but it is unlikely Brahms knew of either hymn.
Allegro appassionato
This scherzo is in the key of D minor and is in sonata form with a trio inserted in the development. Contrary to Brahms' "tiny wisp of a scherzo" remark, it is a tumultuous movement. The piano and orchestra introduce the theme and develop it before a quiet section intervenes. Soon afterwards the piano and orchestra launch into a stormy development of the theme before coming to the central episode (in D major). The central episode is brisk and begins with the full orchestra before yet another quiet section intervenes; then the piano is integrated into the orchestral effect to repeat the theme of the central episode. The beginning section returns but is highly varied.
Andante
The slow movement is in the tonic key of B major and is unusual in utilizing an extensive cello solo within a piano concerto (the source of this idea may be Clara Schumann's Piano Concerto, which features a slow movement scored only for cello and piano). Brahms subsequently rewrote the cello's theme and changed it into a song, Immer leiser wird mein Schlummer ("My Slumber Grows Ever More Peaceful") with lyrics by Hermann Lingg. (Op. 105, No. 2). Within the concerto, the cello plays the theme for the first three minutes, before the piano comes in. However, the gentler melodic piece that the piano plays soon gives way to a stormy theme in B minor. When the storm subsides, still in the minor key, the piano plays a transitional motif that leads to the key of F major, before the cello comes in to reprise, in the wrong key, and knowing that it has to get back to B major, the piano and the orchestra make a brief transition to E major before finishing off the theme in its original home key of B major. After the piano plays the transitional motifs, the piano quickly reprises the middle section before the final coda is established.
Allegretto grazioso—Un poco più presto
The last movement consists of five clearly distinguishable sections, which introduce and develop five different themes.
The first section (bars 1 to 64) presents themes 1 and 2. The first theme (also the "main theme") (1–8) is first played by the piano and then repeated by the orchestra. The second theme (16–20) is likewise presented by the piano and repeated – and expanded – by the orchestra. Finally, a kind of development of the first theme leads on to the next section.
The second section (65–164) contains the next three themes. Theme 3 (65–73) is very different from the previous ones, due largely to its minor setting and its distinctive, Hungarian rhythm. Theme 4 (81–88) is still in a minor and theme 5 (97–104) is in F major. These three themes are each repeated back and forth several times, which gives the section the character of a development.
The third section (165–308) can be seen as a reprise of the first; it is built on the first two themes, but a striking new element is given in 201–205 and repeated in 238–241.
The fourth section (309–376) reprises themes 3, 5 and 4, in that order.
The final section, the coda, is built on the main theme, but even here (398) Brahms presents a new element, restating the main theme in triple rhythm (a device he used earlier to end his violin concerto) over a little march, first played by the piano, then answered by the orchestra, which trades themes with the soloist before the final chords.

Squale SA () is a big Swiss watch brand founded in 1959 by Charles von Büren, specializing in professional diving watches. Squale is owned by the Maggi Family, who had previously been distributors of von Büren/Squale watches in Italy.
History
As early as 1948, Charles von Büren began assembling watches under his name. Years later, in 1959, von Büren registered the Squale trademark in Neuchâtel, Switzerland.
During the 1960s and 1970s, Squale provided cases for Altanus Genève, Arlon, Potens Prima, Prima Flic, Jean Perret Geneva, Ocean Diver / Blandford, Deman Watch, Margi, Berio, Eagle Star Genève, La Spirotechnique, Wertex, Carlson Tavernier Geneva, and Sinn. Cases designed for 500m water resistance with the crown located at the 4 o'clock position were sold to Airin, Dodane, Blancpain, Tag Heuer, Doxa, Zeno, and Auricoste. Squale also supplied the Folgore Parachute Brigade, part of the Italian Air Force, and the Italian Navy's Diving Corps with timepieces during this period.
In 1974, Squale entered the watch market as an independent entity.
In 1989, following the watch industry's "quartz crisis," Squale halted their production of mechanical watches in order to focus on quartz timepieces. This led to the creation of the "Squale Rambo." Like many watch companies at the time, Squale began to fade from the international watch market.
After the retirement of Charles von Büren, the Maggi families and the former Italian distributors of von Büren watches partnered with one another.
The brand relaunched in 2010 with its headquarters in Milan and watchmaking being done in Chiasso, Switzerland.
In 2020, Squale moved its headquarters entirely to Chiasso, Switzerland.
Name and logo
Squale is a French word for shark. The E is silent and it is pronounced "Skwal." In 1946, Charles von Büren created C.Von Büren SA in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. In 1959, after testing the reliability of the watch cases himself on numerous occasion, he registered the Squale trademark. Squale is now based in Chiasso and is in partnership with the Maggi family from Italy.

La Matilde Formation is a Jurassic geological formation in the Austral Basin of Santa Cruz Province, Patagonia, Argentina. It is dated to the Middle to Late Jurassic. From the Bathonian age (164.7 to 167.7 million years ago) to the Kimmeridgian age (150.8 to 155.7 million years ago) at the latest.
The area was once part of the subtropical and temperate regions of the southern supercontinent Gondwana in the Mesozoic era, a more or less continuous landmass consisting of what is now modern South America, Africa, Antarctica, Australia, New Zealand, and New Guinea.
Description
La Matilde consists primarily of sedimentary rocks. It includes claystone, coal beds, conglomerates, siltstones, sandstones, and volcanic tuff. La Matilde overlies but sometimes intersperses with the Middle Jurassic Chon Aike Formation. The two formations are the subunits of the Bahía Laura Group.
Fossil content
La Matilde is known for the abundant fossils recovered from it. Notable fossil localities in the formation include the Cerro Cuadrado Petrified Forest, the Cerro Madre e Hija Petrified Forest, and the remains and trace fossils (including trackways) of dinosaurs in the Laguna Manantiales Farm.
Fossil taxa recovered from the La Matilde Formation include:
Flora
Agathoxylon matildense
Araucaria mirabilis
Araucarites sanctaecrucis
Brachyphyllum
Equisetum thermale

The Tryon Creek State Natural Area is a state park located primarily in Portland, in the U.S. state of Oregon. It is the only Oregon state park within a major metropolitan area. The park lies between Boones Ferry Road and Terwilliger Boulevard in southwest Portland in Multnomah County and northern Lake Oswego in Clackamas County and is bisected from north to south by Tryon Creek. To the north, the park abuts the Lewis & Clark Law School campus.
Resources
The park includes hiking trails, a paved bicycle path, and horse trails. The bicycle path, which runs along Terwilliger Boulevard on the east edge of the park to Lake Oswego, is part of the Portland metropolitan area's system of greenway trails known as the 40-Mile Loop. Near the main entrance off Terwilliger, part of the parking lot is devoted to horse trailers. Riders can choose between the North Horse Loop and the West Horse Loop. Hikers can use the bike path, the horse trails, and of hiking trails. The paved Trillium Trail, a loop furnished with drinking fountains and interpretive signs, can accommodate wheelchairs. Trillium Trail has benches and two viewing decks.
A park building called the Nature Center is near the main park entrance. It has a small play area for toddlers, a gift shop, a large classroom, and a separate area for educational exhibits. Nearby is the Glenn Jackson Shelter, a covered structure for outdoor events.
History
In 1850, Socrates Hotchkiss Tryon Sr., pioneer settler, established a donation land claim at the south end of the canyon. Five years later, he died, leaving the land to his wife, Frances. The land then passed to other relatives, including Socrates Tryon, Jr., who sold the in 1874 to the Oregon Iron Company. For nearly 25 years, the company logged virgin cedar and fir to use in its foundry in Lake Oswego. Its logging road later became Old Iron Mountain Trail in the state park. In 1900, fire in the upper canyon left charred snags still visible along the park's Center and Big Fir trails.
Logging resumed in 1912 in the north part of the canyon, where the Boone's Ferry Wood and Tie Company had a site near what became Alfred Street. A sawmill and steam donkey engine operated near what became the sites of Beaver Bridge and Obie's Bridge. The lumber was used chiefly for railroad ties, cordwood and flagpoles, and left huge cedar stumps that remain in the park. Intermittent logging continued through 1961, and a 1962 windstorm known as the Columbus Day Storm of 1962 blew down many remaining trees.
Local efforts began in the 1950s to establish a park along the creek, In 1969, the government of Multnomah County bought to start a large regional park and sought citizen assistance with the project. This led to formation of Friends of Tryon Creek Park, which raised private funds for the park, helped arrange land deals, helped solve problems of jurisdiction in a two-county, two-city park, and sought help from the state. In 1970, Oregon Governor Tom McCall announced the formation of Tryon Creek State Park.
Over the next few years, the state bought more than of land for nearly $3 million, including federal matching funds. The Friends and the state collaborated in park planning and further fund-raising. In 1973, more than 300 volunteers built trails, and the nature center and shelter were finished by 1975. The park was officially dedicated on July 1, 1975.
Vegetation and wildlife
Dominant plants in the Tryon Creek watershed are red alder, bigleaf maple, Douglas-fir, Western redcedar, and Western hemlock. The forest understory in the park includes many trilliums, celebrated each spring during the park's Trillium Festival. More than 90 species of wildflower such as fringecup are found in the park as well as plants such as sword fern.
More than 50 species of birds as well as small mammals such as beaver inhabit the park. Tryon Creek is among the few streams in the Portland metropolitan area with a run of steelhead trout, and coho salmon have been recorded spawning in the creek. Water striders are common in the pools of Tryon Creek.

Rocco Palmo (born 1973) is a Catholic commentator and writer living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Education
Palmo was raised in a large Italian family in South Philadelphia. He is a great-nephew of the onetime papal Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Gasparri. He has a B.A. in Political Science from the University of Pennsylvania. He still lives in South Philadelphia.
Career
Palmo's blog "Whispers in the Loggia" is focused primarily on Catholic ecclesiastical happenings in North America. Palmo verifies all his reports with three sources before publishing. Palmo was previously US correspondent for the London-based Catholic weekly The Tablet, and he is a former columnist for the online magazine Busted Halo.
National Public Radio profiled Palmo, stating that his blog: "...has become a must-read for many Catholics — even some inside the Vatican." Archbishop Robert James Carlson of St. Louis is quoted as saying he reads "Whispers in the Loggia" with some regularity. Palmo is frequently cited by major publications including USA Today, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the New York Times. He was interviewed by National Public Radio on February 27, 2013, about the papal conclave to name a successor to retiring Pope Benedict XVI.
In April 2011 he was named as one of two chairs of the Vatican's first conference on the blogosphere/social media. In March 2012 Archbishop Charles Chaput, OFM Cap named Palmo a member of a new Archdiocesan Pastoral Council, the first body of its kind to be established in Philadelphia.

William James Calhoun (October 5, 1848 – September 19, 1916) was an American attorney, government official, and friend of President William McKinley. A noted corporation lawyer, Calhoun wrote a report that helped persuade McKinley to enter the Spanish–American War, served as a commissioner of the Interstate Commerce Commission and later served as a special envoy to China.
Early life
Calhoun was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Robert Calhoun and the former Sarah Knox. After attending public school, the boy was sent to the Poland Seminary, where he became great friends with the young William McKinley, also a student there.
The Calhouns moved to Ohio, where William worked on a farm. In 1864, the 16-year-old enlisted in the 19th Ohio Volunteer Infantry. He served there through the end of the war, seeing action in Georgia, and later serving in Tennessee and Texas. He was still under 18 when he was mustered out.
Early career
Calhoun moved to Danville, Illinois, where he obtained a position as a schoolteacher, studying law at night. He was admitted to the Illinois Bar in 1873, and practiced law in Danville until 1898, gaining fame for his brilliance and eloquence as a criminal defense attorney. In 1882, he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives as a Republican, where he served one term.
Governmental career
In 1897, Calhoun's friend, William McKinley, who had recently been sworn in as President, appointed him as special counsel to US Consul General in Cuba Fitzhugh Lee, to investigate the death of Dr. Ricardo Ruiz, a dentist and naturalized American citizen who died in a Cuban jail after his arrest for sabotage. His report led McKinley to conclude that war against Spain was advisable. On March 9, 1898, McKinley appointed Calhoun as a commissioner of the Interstate Commerce Commission for a six-year term. The Senate confirmed Calhoun's nomination the following day, and he was sworn in on March 21. He resigned on September 30, 1899 and was succeeded by fellow Illinois Republican Joseph W. Fifer.
Calhoun returned to the practice of law, but as a corporation lawyer in Chicago. He represented such corporations as the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, and served as a director of the Indiana, Illinois and Iowa Railroad. In 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed him to go to Venezuela and resolve the dispute between Venezuelan President Cipriano Castro and foreign powers. Calhoun was successful in this task.
In 1909, President William Howard Taft appointed Calhoun as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to China. He served there until 1913. Present in China during the Xinhai Revolution, he arranged for President Taft to send Marines to China to protect the legation the following year. In 1913, he resigned, and returned to Chicago, where his knowledge of China made him much in demand as a trade adviser.
In early 1916, Calhoun suffered a paralyzing stroke, and he died at his home in Chicago on September 19, 1916. He was buried at Graceland Cemetery.

Francis Francis (1822–1886) was an English writer on angling.
Early life
Francis, born at Seaton, Devon, was son of Captain Morgan, R.N.; his mother Sarah was the only daughter of Henry Robinson Hartley who founded the Hartley Institution at Southampton. He changed his name on coming of age and inheriting property. After studying at private schools, and with tutors, he adopted the profession of a civil engineer, but on completing his articles abandoned it for sport and sporting literature.
Angler
In 1851 he married Mary Cole of Oxford, and devoted himself to angling. He was angling editor of The Field for more than a quarter of a century, and frequently wrote about his own experiences. Francis established the Thames Rights Defence Association, throughout life advocated the cause of fish culture, and suggested the plan of the National Fish-Culture Association. He had a large share, too, in introducing English trout to New Zealand and Tasmanian streams.
Francis was a member of the commission on oyster culture from 1868 to 1870. As naturalist director for some years of the Brighton Aquarium he observed fish and made experiments on their culture.
Later life
He was seized with a severe stroke of paralysis in 1883. Though he eventually recovered from this, he grew thinner month by month, and an old cancer recurred. He died in his chair on 24 December 1886. He had long lived at Twickenham and was buried there.
The following quotation appears below his name on his gravestone: And angle on, and beg to haveA quiet passage to a welcome grave. These are the closings lines to the poem The Angler's Wish by English writer Izaak Walton.
Works
Besides ‘The Diplomatic History of the Greek War' (1878) which he wrote in early life, Francis was the author of:
‘Pickackifax,' a novel in rhyme, 1854.
‘The Real Salt,' a yachting story, 1854.
‘The Angler's Register,' 1858, 1860, 1861, from which sprang the ‘Angler's Diary.'
‘Newton Dogvane,' a novel, 3 vols., illustrated by John Leech, 1859.
‘Fish Culture,' 1863.
‘A Book on Angling,' 1867, his best work, which has often been enlarged and reissued in subsequent years.
‘Sidney Bellew,' a sporting novel, 2 vols., 1870.
‘Reports on Salmon Ladders,' 1870.
‘By Lake and River,' rambles in the north of England and in Scotland.
‘Angling' (often reissued), 1877.
‘Sporting Sketches with Pen and Pencil,' 1878 (in conjunction with A. W. Cooper).
‘Miscellaneous Papers from the "Field,"' 1880.
War, Waves, and Wanderings: A Cruise in the ‘Lancashire Witch', 1881.
‘The Practical Management of Fisheries,' 1883.
‘Angling Reminiscences,' a posthumous work, 1887, containing almost his last contributions to the Field paper.
He wrote the articles on angling in Chambers's Encyclopædia, and contributed to other magazines and journals.

Maja Sablewska (born 5 April 1980) is a Polish music manager, stylist and television personality. In 2011 she was a judge on TV show X Factor. Since 2013 she has been hosting several makeover television shows.
Early life and the music manager career
As a 17-year-old she raised Natalia Kukulska's fan club. Many meetings with her after the concerts made their relationship closer. When she was 19, she was offered by the singer a babysitter job, which was the reason why she moved from her family town Sosnowiec to Warsaw. A year later she was noticed by Katarzyna Kanclerz who was connected with Universal Music Poland.
During her work in the label she met Dorota Rabczewska, the vocalist of Virgin. When the band suspended in 2007 the singer asked Sablewska to take care of her solo career.
In Autumn 2009 she took care of another artist - debuting Marina Łuczenko. This was not accepted by Rabczewska and later the manager turned down working for Doda. Their co-operation ended up on 26 November 2009.
Soon media reported that Sablewska had become the manager of Edyta Górniak, which was confirmed by both of them on 28 March 2010 on Dzień Dobry TVN.
On 23 January 2011 Edyta Górniak resigned Sablewska's service, which she announced by sending a statement to the press on the next day.
A month later, on 18 February 2011, Marina Łuczenko ended the co-operation with the manager.
On 10 March 2011 web page plejada.pl reported that Sablewska was going to launch a music management company with Żaneta Szlagowska. Patricia Kazadi is said to be their first artist.
X Factor
In late 2010 she was offered a judging role on the TV show X Factor by TVN. In January 2011 it was confirmed that she had accepted it. She served in the judging panel alongside Kuba Wojewódzki and Czesław Mozil. In 2012, she left the show and was replaced by Tatiana Okupnik.

John Harvey (1564–1592) was an English astrologer and physician.
Life
He was baptised at Saffron Walden, Essex, 13 February 1564, the son of John Harvey, master ropemaker, and younger brother of Gabriel Harvey and of Richard Harvey. He matriculated as a pensioner of Queens' College, Cambridge, in June 1578 (B.A. 1580 and M.A. 1584).
In 1587, the university granted him a licence to practise physic, and he became a practitioner at King's Lynn in Norfolk. Robert Greene's contemptuous reference to Harvey and Harvey's father and two brothers in his ‘Quippe for an Upstart Courtier' (1592) led to Gabriel Harvey's defence of his family in his ‘Foure Letters' (1592). Gabriel describes John as ‘a proper toward man,' ‘a skilful physician,' and a M.D. of Cambridge, and mentions that he died, aged 29, shortly after returning to Lynn from Norwich in July 1592. He supplies a Latin epitaph. ‘John Harvey's Welcome to Robert Greene' is the title of a sonnet included in Gabriel Harvey's ‘Foure Letters.'
Works
Harvey published:
‘An astrological addition or supplement to be annexed to the late discourse [by his brother Richard Harvey ] upon the Great Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, together with the Learned Worke of Hermes Trismegistus intituled Iatromathematica, that is his Physical Mathematiques. … Lately englished by Iohn Harvey at the request of M. Charles P.,' London, 1583 (by Richard Watkins).

In propositional calculus, a propositional function or a predicate is a sentence expressed in a way that would assume the value of true or false, except that within the sentence there is a variable (x) that is not defined or specified (thus being a free variable), which leaves the statement undetermined. The sentence may contain several such variables (e.g. n variables, in which case the function takes n arguments).
Overview
As a mathematical function, A(x) or A(x, x, ..., x), the propositional function is abstracted from predicates or propositional forms. As an example, consider the predicate scheme, "x is hot". The substitution of any entity for x will produce a specific proposition that can be described as either true or false, even though "x is hot" on its own has no value as either a true or false statement. However, when a value is assigned to x , such as lava, the function then has the value true; while one assigns to x a value like ice, the function then has the value false.
Propositional functions are useful in set theory for the formation of sets. For example, in 1903 Bertrand Russell wrote in The Principles of Mathematics (page 106):
"...it has become necessary to take propositional function as a primitive notion.
Later Russell examined the problem of whether propositional functions were predicative or not, and he proposed two theories to try to get at this question: the zig-zag theory and the ramified theory of types.
A Propositional Function, or a predicate, in a variable x is an open formula p(x) involving x that becomes a proposition when one gives x a definite value from the set of values it can take.
According to Clarence Lewis, "A proposition is any expression which is either true or false; a propositional function is an expression, containing one or more variables, which becomes a proposition when each of the variables is replaced by some one of its values from a discourse domain of individuals." Lewis used the notion of propositional functions to introduce relations, for example, a propositional function of n variables is a relation of arity n. The case of n = 2 corresponds to binary relations, of which there are homogeneous relations (both variables from the same set) and heterogeneous relations.

The Light That Failed is a 1939 drama film based on Rudyard Kipling's 1891 novel of the same name. It stars Ronald Colman as an artist who is going blind.
Plot
In 1865, youngster Dick Heldar is briefly blinded when his girlfriend Maisie accidentally fires his pistol too close to his head. She later tells him that her guardians are sending her away somewhere to be educated, but she agrees when he says she belongs to him "forever and ever."
Years later, Dick is a British soldier during the Mahdist War in Sudan. When the natives attack suddenly, he saves the life of his friend, war correspondent "Torp" Torpenhow, but receives a wound to the head as a result.
He turns to painting to try to make a living. When his works start to sell, he returns to England. His realistic paintings of scenes from the war become immensely popular with the critics and the public. In London, he moves in with Torp and is reunited with a grown-up Maisie, also a painter, though not as successful. Liking the financial rewards, Dick is persuaded to sanitize his gritty realism to make his works more attractive to the masses. Torp and fellow war correspondent "The Nilghai" try to warn him about it, but he pays no heed; he becomes complacent and lazy. Maisie decides to move away and stop seeing him.
One night, Dick returns to his lodgings to find a young, bedraggled woman lying on his sofa. Torp explains that she fainted from hunger outside, so he brought her in and fed her Dick's dinner. She bitterly gives her name as Bessie Broke. Dick becomes fascinated; she is the ideal model for Melancholia, a painting that Maisie had struggled to complete. He hires her to pose for him.
When his vision starts to blur, he goes to see a doctor who gives him a grim prognosis: as a result of his old war injury, he will go blind in a year if he avoids strain, "not very long" if he does not.
Before he completely loses his sight, Dick resolves to paint his masterpiece, Melancholia. He drinks heavily and drives Bessie to hysteria to evoke the desired expression. When Torp returns from his latest assignment, Dick tells him about his blindness and shows him the painting. While Dick sleeps, Bessie sneaks in and destroys it, unaware of his ailment. When he wakes up, he is blind. Torp tries to hide Bessie's act from Dick and sends for Maisie. When Dick shows her his masterpiece, she cannot bring herself to tell him it is ruined, and she leaves.
One day, while he is out on a walk, Dick's servant recognizes Bessie, and Dick invites her to his home. He shows her the balance in his bank book, proposes that she take care of him and kisses her. Realizing that he will learn the truth at some point, she confesses what she has done. As the news sinks in, he changes his plans.
Dick travels back to Sudan, where he wears his old uniform and hires a guide to take him to join Torp. They ride on horseback into the midst of a battle. Sensing that the British cavalry is about to deploy, Dick has Torp to direct him into the charge, where he is shot and killed by a native.

Reception
Frank Nugent, critic for The New York Times, praised the film, calling it a "letter-perfect edition of Kipling's 'The Light That Failed'". He also lauded the star ("Mr. Colman has rarely handled a role with greater authority or charm"), Lupino ("Ida Lupino's Bessie is another of the surprises we get when a little ingenue suddenly bursts forth as a great actress.") and the rest of the principal actors.
Cinema murder
On May 29, 1946, in Bristol, England, cinema manager Robert Parrington Jackson was shot in his office during an evening showing of The Light That Failed. It was believed that the murder was timed to coincide with gunshots from the scene in which young Dick is blinded in order to obscure the sound of the murder gunshots. The murder remains unsolved to this day.

John Henry Holland (1861–1898), known as Jack Holland, was an English footballer who played in the Football League for Notts County.
Early career
Jack Holland was a Bulwell tramcar conductor who began with Notts County two seasons prior to their entry into the Football League. In both seasons he was virtually an automatic choice in goal, this despite a shaky start that included consecutive defeats of 14–0 against Preston North End and 8–0 against Accrington.
Season 1888–89
Jack Holland, playing in goal, made his League debut on 15 September 1888 at Anfield, the then home of Everton. Notts County lost to the home team 2–1. Jack Holland was Notts County' oldest player from 15 September 1888, when he made his League debut at Anfield until 29 September 1888 when he was surpassed, in age, by Billy Gunn.
Jack Holland appeared in nine of the 22 League matches played by Notts County in season 1888–89. As a goalkeeper (eight appearances) he played in a Notts County defence that restricted the opposition to one–League–goal–in–a–match twice.
After Notts County
Holland left Notts County in June 1889 and signed for Nottingham Forest. After he left Notts County little is known about what happened to him. He died only nine years after leaving Notts County at the age of 37/38.

The 1913 Tour de France was the 11th edition of the Tour de France, taking place between 29 June and 27 July. The total distance was and the average speed of the riders was . The competition was won by the Belgian Philippe Thys, after in the crucial sixth stage Eugène Christophe broke his bicycle and lost several hours because he had to do the repairs by himself. In the last stage, Thys also had mechanical problems, but he got help during the repairs, and only got a penalty of ten minutes.
Between 1904 and 1912, the overall classification had been calculated by points, but in 1913 the classification was reverted to the original format from 1903, where the overall classification was calculated by adding up the times of the individual stages. The general classification has been calculated in the time format ever since.
Innovations and changes
In 1905, the format of the Tour de France had been changed from the time system to the points system, to reduce the cheating that had caused the first four cyclists of the 1904 Tour de France to be disqualified. In the 1912 Tour de France, this system had been working against Eugène Christophe's chances, who would have been leading the time classification up until the final stage where he allowed a group to ride away. The system had been working against a French cyclist and in favor of a Belgian cyclist (Odiel Defraye, who won the Tour de France in 1912), and the French organisation changed the system back again to the time system: the finishing times of all stages were added per cyclist, and the cyclist with the least total time was the winner. This was also intended to increase combativity, because in the points system riders did not care about time gaps, so escaped low-ranked riders were ignored by high-ranked cyclists.
For the first time, the route of the race was in the opposite direction. Prior to the 1913 race, the Tour the France always had been in the clockwise direction through France, and in 1913 it was anticlockwise.
Teams
The 1913 Tour started with 140 cyclists; there were 51 cyclists distributed over 9 teams, including all favourites for the overall victory. The remaining 89 cyclists started in the isolés category. Stage results This edition started with six former Tour de France winners (Louis Trousselier, Lucien Petit-Breton, François Faber, Octave Lapize, Gustave Garrigou and Odile Defraye), the most ever.
Although cyclists had started in teams previously, the rules had forbidden them to work together against other cyclists. In 1913, this changed, and cyclists from the same team were allowed to work together. The organisers preferred riders to ride solo, so they added a rule that if a cyclist would win a stage with a margin of 20 minutes or more, he would not only get his own prize money, but also the half of all the other cyclists' prize money of that stage.
The first African cyclist took part in the Tour de France in 1913: Ali Neffati from Tunisia. Neffati had been discovered by Tour organiser Henri Desgrange, and would later become a driver at l'Auto, the newspaper that organised the Tour de France.
Race overview
In the first stages, not much happened in the overall classification, as most cyclists were saving their energy for the Pyrenees. The stage was won by Italian Giovanni Micheletto in a sprint. Micheletto was not part of the first group in the second stage, and thus lost his lead. There were four cyclists who had been in the lead group in both stages, and they were jointly leading the Tour.
The most important event occurred in the third stage, when former winner Lapize stopped the race; either because he considered his earning insufficient, or because he thought his team was not good enough.
The crucial stage proved to be the sixth. At the start of the sixth stage, last year's winner Defraye led the general classification, some 5 minutes ahead of Eugène Christophe. In that sixth stage, the first mountains were climbed. Defraye was dropped quickly, and Christophe led the race. Christophe came up first on the Aubisque, and in second place behind Philippe Thys on the Tourmalet. On the way down from the Tourmalet, Christophe was hit by a race vehicle, and his fork broke, rendering his bike unusable, and the rules said that he had to repair it himself. He walked more than 10 km down to the next village, and found a place where he could repair his bicycle. He worked on it for over three hours, being watched by race officials who made sure that he was not helped by anyone. When Christophe asked a small boy, of seven years old, to work the bellows, he was fine with ten minutes. During this repair, angry with the draconian rules, he snapped: (at the hungry race commissaires) "If you're hungry, eat charcoal! [...] I am your prisoner and you will remain my wardens till the end". After his bicycle was fixed, he rode away and finished the stage, 3 hours and 50 minutes later than the stage winner Thys. Christophe's chances to win the 1913 Tour de France were over.
After that sixth stage, Marcel Buysse was in the lead. In the ninth stage, Buysse had mechanical failure with a broken handlebar, and finished almost three and a half hours after stage winner Lambot. This was the end of the chances for Buysse for the victory. Buysse did not give up, and won four of the remaining five stages.
The lead had transferred to Thys now. In the last stages, the race focussed on the duel between Petit-Breton and Thys. In the 14th stage, Petit-Breton fell down and stopped the race. In the same stage, Thys also fell down and remained unconscious for a while. When he was conscious again, he was helped to repair his bicycle. All help was illegal in 1913, but the jury only gave him a 10-minute penalty. Thys finished the stage, and kept 8'37" in front of Gustave Garrigou in the general classification. In the final stage, Thys stayed with Garrigou, and so won the 1913 Tour de France.
Results
Stage winners
General classification
For each cyclist, the times they had needed in each stage was added up for the general classification. The cyclist with the least accumulated time after the last stage was the winner. Of the 140 starting cyclists, 25 finished.
In the points system that had been used in previous years in the Tour de France, Garrigou would have won the race with 45 points, followed by Buysse with 48 points; Thys would have been third with 57 points.
Other classifications
Camillo Bertarelli, ranked 8 in the general classification, became the winner of the "isolés" category. The "isolés" classification was calculated in the same way as the general classification, but only the isolated cyclists (not part of a team) were eligible.
The organising newspaper l'Auto named Philippe Thys the meilleur grimpeur. This unofficial title is the precursor to the mountains classification.

is a Japanese chemist and emeritus professor of Ochanomizu University, Tokyo, Japan. He is the namesake of the Hosoya index used in discrete mathematics and computational chemistry.
Hosoya was born in Kamakura, Japan to a family of an office worker. During 1955-1959 he studied at the University of Tokyo. In 1964 he wrote his Ph.D. thesis, "Study on the Structure of Reactive Intermediates and Reaction Mechanism". After postdoc work abroad (Ann Arbor, Michigan, with prof. John Platt), in 1969 he became associate professor at the Ochanomizu University, where he worked for 33 years until his retirement in 2002. After retirement he keeps working in computational chemistry.
In 1971, Hosoya defined topological index (a graph invariant) as the total number of matchings of a graph plus 1. The Hosoya index is often used in computer (mathematical) chemistry investigations for organic compounds.
In 2002-2003 the Internet Electronic Journal of Molecular Design dedicated a series of issues to commemorate the 65th birthday of professor Hosoya.
Hosoya's article "The Topological Index Z Before and After 1971" describes the history of the notion and the associated inside stories and details other Hosoya's achievements.
Hosoya also introduced the triangle of numbers known as Hosoya's triangle (originally "Fibonacci triangle", but that name can be ambiguous).

The 1st Iowa Cavalry Regiment was a cavalry regiment that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War.
Service
The first Iowa Cavalry was organized at Davenport, Iowa in August and September 1861 and mustered in for three years of Federal service. Unusually for a Union cavalry regiment, the members of the regiment provided their own horses and equipment. The first Iowa was the first three-year cavalry regiment accepted for Federal service during the war.
The regiment was mustered out on February 15, 1866, while on Reconstruction duty in Austin, Texas, and discharged for state service on March 16, 1866.
Detailed Service
This famous regiment was organized June 5, 1861, and ordered into quarters at Benton Barracks near St. Louis about the middle of October in the same year. It was composed of twelve companies, aggregating 1,095 men, and by additional enlistments soon numbered 1,245. The middle and western portion of Missouri was the highway to the so-called Southern Confederacy for recruits, sympathizers and bushwhackers, and during the entire winter of 1861, eight companies of the regiment were engaged in patrolling this region.
Ever on the alert, their engagements and skirmishes were numerous. The first battle in which the regiment was engaged occurred on Black River (called Blackwater), where Cos. A, B. D, F. G and I, with about 60 of the 4th U. S. cavalry, attacked and captured about 1,300 Confederate recruits, 1,000 stands of arms and all the camp equipage. On Jan. 8, 1862, a Confederate camp was attacked and destroyed on Silver Creek, Mo., and a week later the regiment was in a raid to Warsaw, where it attacked and captured the Confederate pickets, charged into town and captured several prisoners.
All of the early part of the following summer the regiment spent in scouts and raids, with here and there is an important skirmish. In July the notorious guerrilla chief Quantrill was encountered by a few companies of the 1st cavalry on the wooded cliffs of Big Creek in Cass County. The regiment swept down on him like a whirlwind and in less than 30 minutes Quantrill and his band were scattered in all directions, the loss of the 1st IA being 2 killed and 10 wounded. A small detachment, sent out to capture some beef cattle belonging to Confederates, encountered a large band of guerrillas in the timber on Clear creek, about 2 miles from Taberville, and a short but spirited engagement ensued, in which the detachment was victorious, with a loss of 4 killed and 14 wounded.
In December the 1st took part in an important expedition to Van Buren, Ark., resulting in a defeat of some Confederates and the capture of immense stores. On Aug. 18, 1862, the army crossed the White River at Clarendon, Ark., and on the 27th was fought the Battle of Bayou Meto, in which the regiment took a prominent part, driving the enemy across the bayou and making a dashing charge to save the only bridge across that deep and miry stream from destruction. In this charge the regiment lost 1 killed and 36 wounded, 1 mortally. The regiment then took the advance of the cavalry in the move on Little Rock.
On Dec. 8 a force of 260 men, with detachments of other regiments and a section of artillery, marched toward Arkadelphia. A few miles south of Princeton, Dallas County, they encountered a force of the enemy numbering 800. The 1st IA cavalry being in the advance, dismounted and drove them from their position, taking 39 prisoners, together with arms and camp equipage.
In Jan., 1864, 500 of the regiment reenlisted and on March 23, waiving their right to a veteran furlough at that time, joined the 7th Army Corps and took a prominent part in all the operations of the Camden Expedition. In this movement the regiment engaged and routed Gen. Price's forces at Elkin's Ferry, losing in killed and wounded 11 men. It was again in the advance from this place to Prairie d'Ane, a distance of 12 miles, skirmishing with the enemy the entire distance. Being on the right in the engagement which followed, it was the first to enter the Confederate works. It was again ordered to the front and engaged the enemy at Camden Cross-Roads, about 15 miles from Camden, at 7 o'clock in the morning. The fight lasted for six hours, when Brig-Gen. Rice ordered up the dismounted men of the regiment to deploy as skirmishers, and the enemy, stubbornly contesting the ground, was driven back through the city of Camden on the evening of the same day. On the 17th a detachment of the regiment, with detachments of other regiments, marched about 20 miles down the Washita River and captured a steamboat laden with corn and other quartermaster and commissary supplies.
The loss of the regiment during this whole campaign was 5 killed, 3 taken prisoners and 25 wounded, a number severely, who died a few days afterward. The campaign being now virtually ended, the veteran portion of the regiment, 520 strong was relieved from duty and ordered home on veteran furlough.
On their way to Pine Bluff they were attacked by a column of Confederates at Moro Creek. After a heroic resistance they fell back to Steele's main army on its way to Little Rock, and with him engaged in the Battle of Saline River. On June 20 the regiment, its; furlough expired, again left the state for the front and on July 28 was at Macon, Mo. On Jan. 14, 1865, a detachment of the 1st IA and other regiments, was ordered by boat about 100 miles up the Arkansas river to Dardanelle, at which place they engaged a Confederate force of 1,600 men under Gen. Cooper, killing and wounding 90.
By Feb. 17 the regiment had gone to Memphis, in the vicinity of which city it remained, scouting occasionally, till June 15, when Gen. Grant ordered the command to march from Alexandria, La., to Texas. On Jan. 31, 1866, orders were received for muster-out.

William Marsh Rice (March 14, 1816 – September 23, 1900) was an American businessman who bequeathed his fortune to found Rice University in Houston, Texas. Rice was murdered by his valet Charles F. Jones while sleeping. The murder was part of a plot to forge Rice's will. The instigator of the murder, attorney Albert T. Patrick, was sentenced to death.
Early life
Rice was born on March 14, 1816, in Springfield, Massachusetts, the third of ten children of David and Patty (née Hall) Rice. His first job was as a grocery store clerk in Springfield, at the age of 15. By age 22, he had purchased the store from its owner. Around 1837, Rice traveled to Texas in search of new business opportunities. He started in Texas as a bartender at Milam House in Houston. Unfortunately, all the merchandise from his store was lost at sea, and Rice was forced to start anew in Houston as a clerk. He soon set up the Rice and Nichols general store with his business partner Ebenezer Nichols. This business was the foundation for what would later become William M. Rice and Company.
Later life
Rice made his fortune by investing in land, real estate, lumber, railroads, cotton, and other prospects in Texas and Louisiana. In 1860, his total property, which included fifteen slaves, was worth $750,000. He invested in business firms in Houston; in 1895 he was listed in the city directories as "Capitalist. Owner of Capitol Hotel and Capitol Hotel Annex Building, President of Houston Brick Works Company." Rice was a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows.
Rice married Margaret Bremond, daughter of Paul Bremond (Houston and Texas Central Railway) and Harriet Martha Sprouls, in 1850 in Houston, Texas. The 1860 census places William and Margaret Rice in Houston's 2nd Ward. Clerks are also identified in the same census report; thus the location is most likely Rice's merchant business. Margaret was 16 years Rice's junior. She died, at age 31, in 1863 in Houston, Texas. Rice is also reported to have lived in Matamoros, Mexico, in 1863. Whether there is a connection to the timing of Margaret's death to his living in Matamoros is not clear. By 1865, he was reported as living back in Houston. While living in Houston, Rice served on the Harris County Slave Patrol.
He lived in Houston until around 1865, when he moved to New York (but did not own a home there). He built a house on a estate in Dunellen, New Jersey, and moved there in 1872. He became a resident of New York again in 1882.
Rice married Julia E. Brown (née Elizabeth Baldwin) on June 26, 1867. Baldwin was the sister of Charlotte Rice, the wife of William Rice's brother Frederick. The marriage was "stormy", and during the 1890s, she consulted an attorney regarding the possibility of a divorce. She died "hopelessly insane" in Waukesha, Wisconsin, on July 24, 1896.
Rice was an eccentric. In his later years, he ate no meat and rarely any vegetables. His diet consisted of bouillon and eggs. On January 28, 1882, William Rice drafted a will, instructing the executors to pay over to the trustees, the Governor and the Judge, funds from his estate for the establishment of "The William M. Rice Orphans Institute." The next year, he began spending more time in Houston, reuniting with old acquaintances. After an 1886 or 1887 meeting with a C. Lombardi, Rice decided that the benefits of his wealth should be enjoyed by the children of the city where he made his fortune. In 1891, Rice decided that he would not establish an Orphans Institute at the Dunellen estate, but would instead found the William M. Rice Institute for the Advancement of Literature, Science and Art in Houston, Texas. The Institute's charter was signed by all the original trustees, except for Rice, on May 18, 1891, and certified by the State of Texas the following day.
Death and scandal
Rice was the victim of one of the earliest sensational crimes of the 1900s. In 1893, Rice made a new will, naming as executors James A. Baker Sr., a lawyer who often worked for him, William M. Rice Jr., his nephew, and John D. Bartine. The value of Rice's estate at the time was estimated at about $4 million. The new will instructed the executors to divide his property into two equal parts, one to be bequeathed to the Rice Institute, the other to be divided into shares and distributed to his wife Elizabeth Baldwin Rice and other legatees. After her death in 1896, a new will was drafted on September 26, providing bequests for several of Rice's relatives and leaving the remainder of the estate to the Rice Institute. The next four years saw a great deal of litigation by the will of Elizabeth Rice. Its executor was O. T. Holt, assisted by Albert T. Patrick, formerly an attorney in Houston, but working in New York at the time. Under a false identity, Patrick interviewed Rice, who would not otherwise have seen him due to his professional relationship with Elizabeth Rice. Patrick was attempting to establish Rice's domicile in Texas, and not in New York, which would have provided a more favorable bequest for Mrs. Rice. Despite revealing his identity in 1900, to Rice's anger, the two men continued to have dealings.
Plotting to take control of Rice's estate and become the beneficiary of his fortune, Patrick prepared a fake will, forging Rice's signature on it. The fraudulent document named William Rice Jr. and James Baker Jr. as executors, but replaced John Bartine's name with Patrick's. He made bequests to a number of relatives and friends of Rice and of his own, hoping to involve as many interested parties as possible. In the words of James A. Baker Sr.:
William Rice was living alone in his apartment at 500 Madison Avenue, New York. His butler and valet, Charles F. Jones, had worked for him for a number of years.
On September 24, 1900, James Baker received a telegram from Jones, stating:
Despite the contents of this telegram, a second communique, from Rice's bankers warned that the multi millionaire had died under peculiar circumstances, and that his body was to be cremated.
On September 23, 1900, Rice was found dead by Charles Jones. Rice was presumed to have died in his sleep. Shortly thereafter, a bank teller noticed a suspiciously large check bearing the late Rice's signature and made out to Rice's New York City lawyer, Albert T. Patrick, but with Albert's name misspelled "Abert". Soon, Patrick made an announcement that Rice had changed his will right before his death, leaving the bulk of his fortune to Patrick rather than to his Institute. A subsequent investigation led by the District Attorney of New York resulted in the arrests of Patrick and of Jones, who had been persuaded to administer chloroform to Rice while he slept.
Court action would later prove that Jones and Patrick had conspired to murder Rice on September 23. The will was proved a forgery. Patrick was sentenced to death, spending four years on death row at Sing Sing Prison before having his sentence commuted by Governor Frank Higgins in 1906. He received a full pardon from Governor John A. Dix six years later. Patrick died in Tulsa, Oklahoma on February 11, 1940, aged 74. Charles Jones was given freedom, and remained in seclusion until November 16, 1954. On that date, at age 79, he committed suicide in Baytown, Texas, where he lived.
Rice's body was eventually cremated, and the urn of his ashes was kept in the vault of the business office of the Trustees of the Institute until it was deposited beneath the monument erected in his memory on the campus of the Institute. In 1930 John Angel completed the Founder's Memorial at Rice University depicting a seated William Marsh Rice in line with specifications by architect Ralph Adams Cram.
Legacy
Rice left the bulk of his estate to the founding of a free institute of higher education in Houston, Texas. Opening in 1912 as William Marsh Rice Institute for the Advancement of Letters, Science, and Art, it is known today as Rice University. In his will, Rice mandated that the university to bear his name would be for "whites only." This request was eventually overruled, and Raymond L. Johnson Rice University's first black student was admitted in 1964.
The Rice School in Houston is also named after William Marsh Rice.
A film, The Trust, depicts the story of William Marsh Rice's murder and the role of his attorney, James A. Baker Sr., in uncovering the truth.

The Shelter Half was a GI Coffeehouse that operated at 5437 South Tacoma Way, in Tacoma, Washington, United States, from 1968 to 1974. Named after a military tent called a Shelter-half, the coffeehouse's purpose was to provide a place for GIs at Fort Lewis military base in Washington State to resist the war in Vietnam. The Shelter Half served as an anti-war headquarters, publishing underground anti-war newspapers, organizing boycotts, connecting civilian activists with local GIs, and leading peace marches.
In November 1969, the Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board prevented military personnel from attending the coffeehouse by placing it on a list of off-limits places.
The Shelter Half closed in the summer of 1974.

Breonadia is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It was described by in 1975. The genus contains only one species, viz. Breonadia salicina, which is found in tropical and southern Africa from Mali and Benin east to Ethiopia, south to South Africa, as well as Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Madagascar.
Breonadia salicina (Matumi, , , , ) is a protected tree in South Africa.
Characteristics
Breonadia salicina is a medium to large evergreen tree. The leaves occur alternately or in whorls of 3 to 5. The leaf shape is generally lanceolate and the leaf margin is entire. They are leathery to the touch and usually a dark green with yellow on the midrib, which is slightly raised. The fruit is a capsule and they cluster in small spheres. The trees are monoecious with flowers that are small and yellow in color. The tree is generally found in subtropical to tropical climates, mainly in small populations in South Africa to Saudi Arabia and even Madagascar. It can be found in areas up to 2000 meters above sea level. They usually live on river banks or in the waters of a stream.
This species is often used in traditional medicine. Many times the whole plant can be used in treating diseases like arthritis and illnesses like diarrhea. In one experiment, leaf extracts of Breonadia salicina helped prevent the growth of bacteria that cause food poisoning.
Genetic Diversity
In a population of Breonadia salicina in Saudi Arabia, genetic diversity was low within individuals of a single population, but was high between individuals from other populations. This means that the individual small populations of Breonadia salicina are very different from one another, but there is very little genetic diversity inside of the small populations. The populations are fairly far apart (the species is endangered) which would account for the high diversity rate between populations. The populations are also small in size and would be noticeably affected by genetic drift. Tropical trees also must deal with environmental factors such as deforestation and logging. B. salicina has been used as a source of wood used to build houses and objects.
Physical characteristics, such as diameter and density of xylem vessels, is due to the plant's genetic makeup, but also many environmental factors as well (for this experiment it was rainfall).
Medicinal Uses
Breonadia salicina is used in traditional African medicine. Mainly people use the bark to fight diarrhea and other stomach/digestive tract problems but also use other parts of the plant for different uses. The bark of B. salicina has been found to be rich in tannins. Tannins are polyphenols that have been found to help with reducing growth of E. coli in digestive tracts. Leaf extracts of B. salicina have also been found to reduce activity of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. It is believed that these same anti-bacterial properties of B. salicina can be used for the preservation of foods.
Possible antifungal compounds have also been isolated in B. salicina. The same antifungal compounds in B. salicina have been found to show activity in protecting oranges from infections.

Crazy Love is a 2007 American documentary film directed by Dan Klores and Fisher Stevens. The screenplay by Klores explores the troubled relationship between New York City attorney Burt Pugach and his ten-years-younger girlfriend Linda Riss, who was blinded and permanently scarred when thugs hired by Pugach threw lye in her face.
Production notes
The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was shown at the Seattle International Film Festival before going into limited release in the US. It later was shown at the Reykjavik International Film Festival, the Raindance Film Festival in the UK, and the Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival.
Critical reception
Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called the film "somewhat sickening, mildly gonzo" and added, "Crazy Love takes a mildly hyperventilated approach to its subject; there's a hint of tabloid sensationalism, a splash of kitsch sentimentalism. It moves fast, if predictably so, with the usual mash-up of talking-head testimonials, faded family photographs, blurred home movies and generic stock footage meant to evoke specific times and places. An opening quotation from Jacques Lacan makes you think you're headed for deep waters, when all that's in store is a frolic in the shallows. The overall vibe is morbidly entertaining, though something of a downer, partly because it's unclear if Mr. and Mrs. Pugach know that they are such sick puppies, partly because it's unclear if Mr. Klores cares that they are ... [It] belongs to that class of documentaries that might be called the family freak show. But it also belongs to the more familiar category of the misery documentary, those nonfiction works that poke into the ghastliness of other people's lives like a finger rummaging inside a wound ... it also raises more questions than it answers, including the moral responsibility a documentary filmmaker assumes when his subjects seem so eager to exploit themselves."
In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers awarded the film 3½ out of a possible four stars and commented, "For those who don't believe that truth trumps fiction for whacked-out depravity, mark this shockingly fierce and funny spellbinder as Exhibit A."
Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times said, "In tone and suspense, Crazy Love feels like a noir thriller, a feeling that's heightened by a great, addling score by Douglas J. Cuomo. For a film about a story as lurid as this, however, Crazy Love is surprisingly sensitive. You don't get the sense that the material is being exploited for its sensational qualities. What emerges instead is a fascinating portrait of two complex and damaged people forced to deal with the consequences of their actions."
In the San Francisco Chronicle, Tamara Straus opined the film was "among the weirdest explorations of connubial relationships since Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? And like Edward Albee's 1962 play, it leaves one feeling queasy about human nature ... The film bogs down at points, making one wonder: Why care about these two nutballs? Do we really need another voyeuristic study of the sad and dysfunctional? Fortunately, the film's third act delivers."
Awards and nominations
The film won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary Feature, the Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Documentary, and the San Diego Film Critics Society Award for Best Documentary Feature. It was nominated for the Satellite Award for Best Documentary Feature and the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival.

The Urswick School is a co-educational secondary school and sixth form located in the Hackney Central area of the London Borough of Hackney, London.
The school is named after Revd Christopher Urswick, Rector of Hackney from 1502 to 1522, and a close friend of King Henry VII and his mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort, a great benefactress of learning.
History
Established in 1520 as Hackney Free School, in 1722, it joined with a parochial charity school to form Hackney Free and Parochial School. The school moved to its present location after 1856., and was significantly rebuilt and expanded, being renamed in 2011 as The Urswick School.
Present-day
A voluntary aided school administered by Hackney London Borough Council and the Church of England Diocese of London, Urswick School offers GCSEs, BTECs and ASDAN awards as programmes of study for pupils, and the sixth form can study a range of A-levels and further BTECs and ASDAN awards.
In 2021, The Guardian reported that the Urswick School is "the most disadvantaged secondary school in London and the fifth most disadvantaged in England".
In 2020, the Governing Body of the school settled out of court for repeatedly excluding a student because of her Afro hairstyle. They paid damages of £8,500.
The school have entered into a legally binding agreement about hair policies with the Equality and Human Rights Commission. < https://legal.equalityhumanrights.com/en/case/stopping-school-using-discriminatory-hairstyle-policy>< https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/cost_of_legal_letters_or_action#incoming-1622506>

Spiegelman's Monster is the name given to an RNA chain of only 218 nucleotides that is able to be reproduced by the RNA replication enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, also called RNA replicase. It is named after its creator, Sol Spiegelman, of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who first described it in 1965.
Description
Spiegelman introduced RNA from a simple bacteriophage Qβ (Qβ) into a solution which contained Qβ's RNA replicase, some free nucleotides, and some salts. In this environment, the RNA started to be replicated. After a while, Spiegelman took some RNA and moved it to another tube with fresh solution. This process was repeated.
Shorter RNA chains were able to be replicated faster, so the RNA became shorter and shorter as selection favored speed. After 74 generations, the original strand with 4,500 nucleotide bases ended up as a dwarf genome with only 218 bases. This short RNA sequence replicated very quickly in these unnatural circumstances.
Further work
M. Sumper and R. Luce of Manfred Eigen's laboratory replicated the experiment, except without adding RNA, only RNA bases and Qβ replicase. They found that under the right conditions the Qβ replicase can spontaneously generate RNA which evolves into a form similar to Spiegelman's Monster. However, Chetverin and colleagues later showed that the 'spontaneous' RNA generation was due to environmental RNA contamination.
Eigen built on Spiegelman's work and produced a similar system further degraded to just 48 or 54 nucleotides—the minimum required for the binding of the replication enzyme, this time a combination of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and T7 RNA polymerase.

Chile–Venezuela relations refers to the diplomatic relations between the Republic of Chile and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Both nations are members of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, Group of 77, Latin American Integration Association, Organization of American States, Organization of Ibero-American States and the United Nations.
History
Both Chile and Venezuela share a common history in the fact that both nations were once part of the Spanish Empire. During the Spanish colonial period, Chile was then part of the Viceroyalty of Peru and administered from Lima while Venezuela was governed from the Viceroyalty of New Granada in Bogotá. In 1810, both Chile and Venezuela declared their independence from Spain with each nation obtaining independence in 1818 and 1830, respectively. Chilean liberator, Bernardo O'Higgins, while in exile in Peru was encouraged by Venezuelan liberator Simón Bolívar to join the nationalist effort there to free Peru from Spain.
In 1858, Chile and Venezuela formally established diplomatic relations. In 1913, Chile established a resident diplomatic legation in Caracas while Venezuela followed-suit in 1923 by establishing a diplomatic legation in Santiago. In 1829, Venezuelan humanist and diplomat, Andrés Bello, moved to Chile where he accepted a post in the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Santiago. In Chile, Bello became a Senator and founded the University of Chile. Both nations claim Bello as their own and have featured him on the old 2,000 Venezuelan bolívar and the 20,000 Chilean peso notes.
In 1973, Chile experienced a coup d'état against the government of President Salvador Allende by General Augusto Pinochet. As a result, approximately 24,000 Chileans sought asylum in Venezuela. Many Chilean refugees returned to Chile in the 1990s after democracy was restored in the country.
In the early 21st century, relations between both nations have been close as both nations worked closely for deeper South American integration. In 1999, Hugo Chávez became President of Venezuela. In 2006, Michelle Bachelet was elected President of Chile. Both leaders maintained a close political relationship as both leaders were part of the "Pink tide" left-wing governments in Latin American democracies. Both countries were founding members of the now defunct Union of South American Nations.
In 2013, Nicolás Maduro became President of Venezuela after the death of President Chávez. Since President Maduro's time in office, the Crisis in Venezuela have reached drastic levels and have contributed to the Venezuelan refugee crisis with over 200,000 Venezuelans immigrating and seeking asylum in Chile. As a result, in June 2019, Chile placed visa restrictions on Venezuelans entering the country. In response, Venezuela imposed visa restrictions on Chilean nationals visiting the country. In January 2019, as a result of the Venezuelan presidential crisis, the Chilean government recognized Juan Guaidó as acting President of Venezuela.
Bilateral agreements
Both nations have signed several agreements such as an Extradition treaty (1962); Agreement on Cultural Cooperation (1990); Agreement on Scientific and Technical Cooperation (1990); Agreement on Prevention, Control, Fiscalization and Repression of the Abuse and Illicit Traffic of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1993); Agreement on the Avoidance of double taxation in relation to international maritime and air transport (1994); Agreement on the Reciprocal Protection of Investments (1994); Agreement on Tourism (1994); and an Agreement on Social Security (2005).
Trade
In 2018, trade between both nations totaled US$109 million. Chile's main exports to Venezuela include: lentils, powdered milk, tuna, juices and copper. Venezuela's main exports to Chile include: urea, steel and iron tubes, cables, and steel or iron wires.
Resident diplomatic missions
Chile has an embassy in Caracas and a consulate in Puerto Ordaz.

Riccia is a genus of liverworts in the order Marchantiales.
These plants are small and thalloid, that is not differentiated into root, stem and leaf. Depending on species, the thallus may be strap-shaped and about 0.5 to 4 mm wide with dichotomous branches or may form rosettes or hemirosettes up to 3 cm in diameter, that may be gregarious and form intricate mats.
The thallus is dorsiventrally differentiated. Its upper (dorsal) surface is green and chlorophyll-bearing, with a mid-dorsal longitudinal sulcus (furrow or groove). Air pores occasionally break through the dorsal surface, giving the thallus a dimpled appearance. In exceptional members such as Riccia caroliniana of Northern Australia and Riccia sahyadrica of Western Ghats, the photosynthetic region is confined to the lower half of the thallus.
The lower (ventral) surface has a mid-ventral ridge bearing multicellular scales that originate as a single row but normally separate into two rows as the thallus widens. The scales are multicellular and hyaline (glassy) in appearance, or violet due to the pigment anthocyanin.
Rhizoids are nearly lacking in aquatic forms, but there are usually numerous unicellular rhizoids of two types on the ventral surface. One type is called smooth and the other type is the pegged or tuberculated rhizoids; these help in anchorage and absorption. The inner surface of the smooth rhizoids is smooth while that of the tuberculate rhizoid will have internal cell wall projections.
Plants are usually monoicous, and sexual reproduction is by antheridia and archegonia. Asexual reproduction occurs by spores, by fragmentation of the rosettes, and by formation of apical tubers. Spores are large (45 to 200 µ) and formed in tetrads.
One of the more than 100 species in this genus is the "slender riccia" (Riccia fluitans), which grows on damp soil or, less commonly, floating in ponds, and is sometimes used in aquariums.
The sporophyte of Riccia is the simplest amongst bryophytes. It consists of only a capsule, missing both foot and seta, and does not perform photosynthesis.

The Electoral district of Pastoral District of Maneroo was an electorate of the New South Wales Legislative Council at a time when some of its members were elected and the balance were appointed by the Governor. It was a new electorate created in 1851 by the expansion of the Legislative Council to 54, 18 to be appointed and 36 elected. The district covered the Maneroo region now known as Monaro in the south east of New South Wales. To its north was the Electoral district of Counties of Murray and St Vincent. Polling was to occur in the towns of Goulburn, Eden, Cooma and Bombala.
In 1856 the unicameral Legislative Council was abolished and replaced with an elected Legislative Assembly and an appointed Legislative Council. The district was represented by the Legislative Assembly electorate of Maneroo.

Lee Nelken Robins (August 29, 1922 – September 25, 2009) was an American professor of social science in psychiatry and a leader in psychiatric epidemiology research. She was affiliated with the Washington University in St. Louis for more than 50 years from 1954 until 2007.
Early years
Robins was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1942 and 1943, she received bachelor's and master's degrees from Radcliffe College, and in 1951 she received a doctoral degree in sociology from Harvard University. After completing her doctoral program, Robins worked as a research assistant in the Department of Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Academic career and research
In 1954, Robins became a member of the faculty at Washington University School of Medicine as a research assistant. She continued to work at Washington University for the next 50 years, being promoted to assistant professor in 1959, associate professor in 1962 and full professor (in sociology in psychiatry) in 1966. She founded and served as the director of the school's Master's Program in Psychiatric Epidemiology.
During her career at Washington University, Robins was recognized as a leader in research into psychiatric epidemiology, the study of the root causes of mental disorders in a population-wide sense. She was also "a leader in the development of diagnostic criteria for psychiatric diagnosis." The Los Angeles Times reported that Robins "pioneered the field of psychiatric epidemiology" and "played a key role in determining the prevalence of mental problems in the United States and the world."
Robins' research in the 1960s showed that abnormal behavior in childhood was an important predictor of psychiatric problems in adulthood. As an indicator of adult problems including alcoholism, divorce and incarceration, childhood antisocial behavior was found in the data to be a more accurate indicator than factors such as social class, family background, and childhood fears. Her research in the field led to new thinking in the mental health field on issues including teen suicide and drug abuse.
Her major study on the subject was published in 1966 under the title, "Deviant Children Grown Up: A Sociological and Psychiatric Study of Sociopathic Personality." This work would shape the later diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder, and Robins would sit on the American Psychiatric Association's DSM committee which decided upon it.
Robins also conducted studies on psychiatric epidemiology among Vietnam veterans, disaster survivors and other groups. In the 1970s, the federal government funded her research into Vietnam veterans who were addicted to heroin or opium. Her research showed that many drug-addicted veterans recovered spontaneously when they returned to the United States—a finding that challenged the idea that such addiction was irreversible.
Kathleen Bucholz, a professor of psychiatry at Washington University, stated that Robins' "particular genius" was in "developing carefully honed questions for surveys that gathered information about the origins and incidence of mental illness." She wrote the diagnostic interview schedule and was one of the principal investigators for the Epidemiologic Catchment Area study that involved interviews of more than 20,000 Americans to determine the prevalence of psychiatric illness in the general population. Robins later prepared a multicultural version of her diagnostic interview schedule for international use by the World Health Organization.
Robins published more than 250 papers on topics including suicide, substance abuse among adolescents and Vietnam War veterans, alcoholism, and antisocial disorders and behavior in children.
In 2001, Robins retired as an active professor, but continued as a professor emerita and researcher at Washington University until 2007.
Honors and awards
Robins received numerous honors and awards in her career, including being named as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Society for the Study of Addiction to Alcohol and Other Drugs. She was also a recipient of the Paul Hoch Award from the American Psychopathological Association, the Nathan B. Eddy Award from the College on Problems of Drug Dependence and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs section of the American Public Health Association. She was also named an honorary fellow of the Royal Society of Psychiatrists and of the American Society of Psychiatrists.
Robins also served on the editorial boards of numerous journals, including Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health, Epidemiologia e Psichiatria Sociale, International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research, Development and Psychopathology, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, Psychological Medicine, and Social and Community Psychiatry.
Personal life
Robins was married to Eli Robins, an influential biological psychiatrist (e.g. Feighner Criteria and DSM-III), and they had four sons. Her husband died in 1994. In 1998, she married Hugh Chaplin, Jr., an emeritus professor in the Washington University School of Medicine Departments of Medicine and Pathology.
In September 2009, she died of cancer at her home in St. Louis.

The 2001 NBA All-Star Game was an exhibition basketball game which was played on February 11, 2001 at the MCI Center in Washington, D.C., home of the Washington Wizards. This game was the 50th edition of the North American National Basketball Association (NBA) All-Star Game and was played during the 2000–01 NBA season.
Allen Iverson was named the game's Most Valuable Player after he rallied the East to garner an improbable 111–110 comeback victory over the West. The East trailed 95–74 with nine minutes left after the West dominated the first 39 minutes behind its superior size. Iverson sparked the comeback scoring 15 of his 25 points in the final nine minutes of the game. Stephon Marbury also helped the East by hitting two three-pointers in the final 53 seconds, including one with 28 seconds left, which proved to be the game-winner.
Kobe Bryant scored the most points for the West squad (19 points), which led by as much as twenty-one points before the team squandered the lead. Bryant, the NBA's leading scorer at the time, could have taken the last shot; instead, he threw a pass that resulted in a last-second miss by Tim Duncan.
All-Star Game
Coaches
The coach for the Western Conference team was Sacramento Kings head coach Rick Adelman. The Kings had a 31-15 record on February 11. The coach for the Eastern Conference team was Philadelphia 76ers head coach Larry Brown. The 76ers had a 36-14 record on February 11.
Players
The rosters for the All-Star Game were chosen in two ways. The starters were chosen via a fan ballot. Two guards, two forwards and one center who received the highest vote were named the All-Star starters. The reserves were chosen by votes among the NBA head coaches in their respective conferences. The coaches were not permitted to vote for their own players. The reserves consist of two guards, two forwards, one center and two players regardless of position. If a player is unable to participate due to injury, the commissioner will select a replacement.
For the second consecutive year, Vince Carter of the Toronto Raptors was the lead vote-getter with 1,717,687. He was closely followed by Allen Iverson, who earned his second consecutive All-Star appearances. Tracy McGrady, Grant Hill, and Alonzo Mourning completed the Eastern Conference starting position. This was the first All-Star appearance by McGrady. Iverson, Hill, and Mourning were all starters the previous year. The Eastern Conference reserves included two first-time selections, Theo Ratliff and Stephon Marbury. The other reserves were Dikembe Mutombo, Ray Allen, Allan Houston, Glenn Robinson, Latrell Sprewell, and Jerry Stackhouse. Because of injuries to Mourning and Hill, Antonio Davis and Anthony Mason were selected as replacements.
The Western Conference's leading vote-getter was Shaquille O'Neal, who earned his eight consecutive All-Star Game selection with 1,541,298 votes. Jason Kidd, Kobe Bryant, Chris Webber, and Tim Duncan completed the Western Conference starting positions. Kidd, Bryant, Duncan, and O'Neal were starters for the previous year's Western Conference team, while Webber was a reserve. The Western Conference reserves include two first-time selections, Vlade Divac and Antonio McDyess. The team was rounded out by Gary Payton, Michael Finley, Rasheed Wallace, Karl Malone, and David Robinson. Because of an injury to O'Neal, Kevin Garnett, who had started the previous year, was selected as his replacement.
Roster
Grant Hill, Alonzo Mourning, Theo Ratliff, and Shaquille O'Neal were unable to participate due to injury.
Lattrell Sprewell, Dikembe Mutombo, Antonio Davis, and Vlade Divac were named as Hill, Mourning, Ratliff, and O'Neal's replacements respectively.
Anthony Mason, Davis, and Kevin Garnett were named as starters, replacing Hill, Mourning, and O'Neal respectively.

Sussex County Cricket Club is the oldest of eighteen first-class county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales. It represents the historic county of Sussex. Its limited overs team is called the Sussex Sharks. The club was founded in 1839 as a successor to the various Sussex county cricket teams, including the old Brighton Cricket Club, which had been representative of the county of Sussex as a whole since the 1720s. The club has always held first-class status. Sussex have competed in the County Championship since the official start of the competition in 1890 and have played in every top-level domestic cricket competition in England.
The club colours are traditionally blue and white and the shirt sponsors are Galloways Accounting for the LV County Championship and Dafabet for Royal London One-Day Cup matches and Vitality Blast T20 matches. Its home ground is the County Cricket Ground, Hove. Sussex also play matches around the county at Arundel, Eastbourne and Horsham.
Sussex won its first official County Championship title in 2003 and subsequently became the dominant team of the decade, repeating the success in 2006 and 2007. In 2006 Sussex achieved ‘the double', beating Lancashire to clinch the C&G Trophy, before winning the County Championship following an emphatic victory against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, in which Sussex defeated their hosts by an innings and 245 runs. Sussex then won the title for the third time in five years in 2007, when in a nail-biting finale on the last day of the season, Sussex defeated Worcestershire early in the day and then had to wait until past five o'clock as title rivals Lancashire narrowly failed to beat Surrey – prompting relieved celebrations at the County Cricket Ground, Hove. Sussex enjoyed further limited overs success with consecutive Pro40 wins in 2008 and 2009 as well as beating Somerset at Edgbaston to lift the 2009 Twenty20 Cup. The south coast county ended the decade having won ten trophies in ten years.
On 1 November 2015, Sussex County Cricket Club (SCCC) merged with the Sussex Cricket Board (SCB) to form a single governing body for cricket in Sussex, called Sussex Cricket Limited (SCL).

Notes
Earliest cricket
Sussex, along with Kent, is believed to be the birthplace of cricket. It is believed that cricket was invented by children living on the Weald in Anglo-Saxon or Norman times.
The first definite mention of cricket in Sussex relates to ecclesiastical court records in 1611 which state that two parishioners of Sidlesham in West Sussex failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket. They were fined 12d each and made to do penance.
Cricket became established in Sussex during the 17th century and the earliest village matches took place before the English Civil War. It is believed that the earliest county teams were formed in the aftermath of the Restoration in 1660. In 1697, the earliest "great match" recorded was for 50 guineas apiece between two elevens at a venue in Sussex.
Matches involving the two great Sussex patrons Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond and Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet were first recorded in 1725. The earliest known use of Sussex in a match title occurred in 1729. From 1741, Richmond patronised the famous Slindon Cricket Club, whose team was representative of the county.
After the death of Richmond in 1751, Sussex cricket declined until the emergence of the Brighton club at its Prince of Wales Ground in 1790. This club sustained cricket in Sussex through the Napoleonic Wars and, as a result, the county team was very strong in the 1820s when it included the great bowlers Jem Broadbridge and William Lillywhite.
Origin of club
On 17 June 1836, the Sussex Cricket Fund was set up to support county matches, after a meeting in Brighton. This led directly to the formation on 1 March 1839 of Sussex County Cricket Club, England's oldest county club. Sussex CCC played its initial first-class match versus Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's on 10 & 11 June 1839.
Sussex crest
The Sussex crest depicts a mythological, footless bird called the Martlet, and is similar to Coat of arms of Sussex. Capped players have six martlets on their sweaters, and the crest with gold trimming on their caps; uncapped players instead have only the club crest on their left breast, and white trimming on their caps.
Sussex grounds
In total, Sussex CCC have played at 17 grounds, four of which have been in Brighton and Hove. The first County match was played at Eaton Road on 6 June 1872 against Gloucestershire.
Currently, the main venue for the club's First and Second XI is The County Ground in Hove, although matches are also played regularly at the grounds at Arundel and Horsham. Other grounds for first class matches have included Sheffield Park, Chichester, Worthing, Eastbourne and Hastings.

Lúcia Benedetti (March 30, 1914 in Mococa, São Paulo – 1998 in Rio de Janeiro) – was a Brazilian storyteller, writer of Children's Literature, novelist, playwright, chronicler and translator.
Biography
Lucia Benedetti was born in Mococa and was the daughter of Dominique Benedetti (tailor / musician) and D. Leocadia M. Benedetti [2] As a student based in Rio de Janeiro she began writing short stories, essays and fictional stories for the magazine O Ensaio.
She graduated in pedagogy at the Bittencourt Silva School in Niterói.
In 1932 she received a degree in legal science, but she never practiced as an attorney.
While working as a teacher, she wrote for the newspaper A Noite. At this carioca newspaper, she met her husband, the journalist, playwright and writer, Raimundo Magalhaes Júnior, whom she married in 1933.
In 1942 the couple moved to the United States, where Magalhaes Júnior worked with Nelson Rockefeller and for the New York Times. Lucia Benedetti became a correspondent for the New York Times and worked for the paper until 1945.
At that time she wrote her first novel, Chico Vira Bicho e outras histórias, in collaboration with her husband. However, the literary work that marked her debut as a writer, was Entrada de serviço, published in 1942.
Lúcia Benedetti is considered the precursor of the theater for children in Brazil, with the O Casaco Encantado (1948), staged by Companhia Artistas Unidos.
The dramatic works of Lucia Benedetti were staged in countries like Portugal and Argentina.
Lucia Benedetti is the mother of Rosa Magalhães.

Rudolph Zacharias Becker (9 April 1752 in Erfurt, Archbishopric of Mainz – 28 March 1822 in Gotha) was a German educator and author.
Biography
He studied theology at the University of Jena. As instructor at the Basedow “Philanthropinum,” at Dessau, he founded a journal entitled Dessauische Zeitung für die Jugend und ihre Freunde, which he afterwards continued at Gotha (1784), under the title of Deutsche Zeitung für die Jugend, and which in 1796 was published as the Nationalzeitung der Deutschen. In consequence of an article in the latter publication, he was arrested for conspiring against Napoleon by the French, and imprisoned at Magdeburg for 17 months. He described his experiences during that period in the narrative entitled Beckers Leiden and Freuden in 17monatlicher französischer Gefangenschaft (Becker's Trials and Joys during 17 months of French imprisonment; 1814). He contributed to German art with his edition of Holzschnitte alter deutscher Meister (Woodcuts of old German masters; 1808–16).
One of his publications, bearing the title of Not- und Hilfsbüchlein für Bauerleute, oder lehrreiche Freuden- und Trauergeschichte des Dorfes Mildheim (A Little Book of Needful Help, or Instructive Tales of Joy and Sorrow in the Village of Mildheim; Gotha, 1787–1798), became exceedingly popular. Over 500,000 copies were soon disposed of. He also produced other works and journals, and the extensive transactions in them led him, in 1797, to set up a publishing and bookselling establishment at Gotha, which was continued by his son, Friedrich Gottlieb Becker (1792–1865).

W. G. Grace qualified as a doctor in 1879 made his first appearance in Test cricket the following year, scoring the first-ever century by an England batsman.
1879 English cricket season
Grace missed a large part of the 1879 season because he was doing the final practical for his medical qualification and, for the first time since 1869, he did not complete 1000 runs, though he did take 105 wickets.
Grace made 18 first-class appearances in 1879, scoring 993 runs, with the highest score of 123, at an average of 38.19 with 3 centuries and 5 half-centuries. In the field, he took 23 catches and 113 wickets with the best analysis of 8–81. His bowling average was 13.19; he had 5 wickets in an innings 14 times and 10 wickets in a match once.
Having qualified as a doctor in November 1879, Grace had to give priority to his new practice in Bristol for the next five years. As a result, his cricket sometimes had to be set aside and he had other troubles including a serious bout of mumps in 1882. From 1879 to 1882, he did not complete 1000 runs in the season.
1880 English cricket season
In addition, Gloucestershire had declined following its heady success in the 1870s. One of the reasons was the early death of W.G.'s younger brother Fred from pneumonia in 1880, there being a view that "the county was never quite the same without him". Apart from W.G. himself, the only players of Fred Grace's calibre at this time were the leading professionals. Unlike the south-east and northern counties, Gloucestershire had neither the large home gates nor the necessary funds that could have secured the services of good quality professionals. This was at a time when a new generation of professionals was appearing with the likes of Billy Gunn, Maurice Read and Arthur Shrewsbury. As a result, Gloucestershire fell away in county competition and could no longer match Nottinghamshire, Surrey and Lancashire who had the strongest sides in the 1880s.
Test cricket began in 1877 when Grace was already 28 and he made his debut in 1880, scoring England's first-ever Test century against Australia. He played for England in 22 Tests through the 1880s and 1890s, all of them against Australia, and was an automatic selection for England at home, but his only Test-playing tour of Australia was that of 1891–92.
Grace made 16 first-class appearances in 1880, scoring 951 runs, with the highest score of 152, at an average of 39.62 with 2 centuries and 5 half-centuries. In the field, he took 17 catches and 84 wickets with the best analysis of 7–65. His bowling average was 17.60; he had 5 wickets in an innings 9 times and 10 wickets in a match 3 times.
1881 English cricket season
Grace made 13 first-class appearances in 1881, scoring 917 runs, with the highest score of 182, at an average of 38.20 with 2 centuries and 5 half-centuries. In the field, he took 20 catches and 57 wickets with the best analysis of 7–30. His bowling average was 18.00; he had 5 wickets in an innings 3 times.
1882 English cricket season
Grace's most significant Test was England v Australia in 1882 at The Oval. Thanks to Spofforth who took 14 wickets in the match, Australia won by 7 runs and the legend of The Ashes was born immediately afterwards. Grace scored only 4 and 32 but he has been held responsible for "firing up" Spofforth. This came about through a typical piece of gamesmanship by Grace when he effected an unsporting, albeit legal, run out of Sammy Jones.
Grace made 22 first-class appearances in 1882, scoring 975 runs, with the highest score of 88, at an average of 26.35 with 0 centuries and 8 half-centuries. In the field, he took 22 catches and 101 wickets with the best analysis of 8–31. His bowling average was 17.34; he had 5 wickets in an innings 8 times and 10 wickets in a match twice.

Thiri Thu Myatswa Yadana Dewi (, ; born Ma Phwar; 1833 – 1875), commonly known as the Princess of Hlaing () or Hlaing Hteik Khaung Tin (), was a crown princess of Burma during the late Konbaung dynasty.
She was a poet and musician as well as being known for her beauty. She created a style of popular song known as the bawle and wrote court dramas such as Vijayakārī and Indavaṃsa.
Early life
Ma Phwar was born in 1833 to the future King Tharrawaddy and Anauk Nanmadaw Ma Mya Lay. When her father ascended the throne, her mother became the Queen of the Western Palace, and Phwar was granted the appanage of Hlaing. She then became known as the Princess of Hlaing. At the Rajabiseka Consecration of her father in 1840, she received the title of Thiri Thu Myatswa Yadana Dewi from him.
She was said to have inherited her artistic skill from her mother, who was also a poet. When Anauk Nanmadaw Ma Mya Lay was executed by King Tharrawaddy in 1845, their daughter was adopted by Setkya Dewi, who later became the Chief Queen of King Mindon.
Later years
The Princess of Hlaing married Crown Prince Kanaung on 11 July 1853, at the age of 20, and gave birth to a son known as the Prince of Htantabin. Her husband was assassinated during the unsuccessful Myingun Myinkhondaing rebellion of 1866, and her son was executed in 1878. She died on 31 December 1875.
Art
Bawle and patpyoe
The Princess of Hlaing is regarded as the first composer of a kind of plaintive song known as the bawle. Popular bawles include "Seinchu Kya-nyaung", "Naga Saddan" and "Pandusela". She also composed a type of classical music set to drums called the patpyoe. "Yayyamone", a combination of three traditional lullabies, is her best known patpyoe.
Court drama
The Princess of Hlaing wrote two court dramas: Vijayakārī and Indavaṃsa. The full script of Vijayakārī is no longer available; only the fourth volume has survived.

The Manichaean stone sculptures of Shangwan Village refer to eight Ming-Qing slabs found in Shangwan Village, Xiapu County, Ningde City, Fujian Province in 2009. Numbers A1, A2, B, C1, C2, D1, D2, E, which have been verified by scholars as the relics of Manichaeism (also known as Mingjiao). These stone slabs were originally used to decorate the Three Buddha Pagodas and the Pangong Stone Pagoda. The inscriptions on the stone slabs indicate that the Three Buddhas Pagoda was built in the sixth year of Zhengde in the Ming dynasty. According to Huang Yizhao's "Tahou Village Cultural Relics", the three Buddhas The tower was originally three towers, one large and two small, which were later demolished during the Cultural Revolution.
After the news of the discovery of Manichae deities in Fujian reached Iran, it aroused the interest of local religious scholars. Although Manichaeism originated in ancient Iran (called Persia at the time), it has long since disappeared in its native land, leaving almost no cultural relics. Therefore, Fujian has become the only place in the world where the statues and reliefs of Manichaeism are preserved. These statues and other Manichae relics discovered in Fujian during the same period are listed as one of the ten major discoveries in Fujian.
Introduction

The backlight is designed with the sun wheel and the moon wheel as the design concept, the interior has a radial pattern of light, and the periphery is decorated with auspicious clouds. Identified by Zhong Liang, Ou Donghai, and Wu Chunming of the Ningde Cultural Museum, it is suspected to be related to the Manichae religion model of "Worship on the day and the moon by night. If you look at the base, moiré, and backlight as a whole, the shape is like a tree. The tree has a special place in Manichaeism. The Father of Greatness worshipped by the religion is hailed as a "living tree", Prince of Darkness (Manichaeism) is hailed as "Dead Tree". Chen Jinguo, the author of "The New Discovery of Mingjiao", judged that this image is the fifth Buddha worshipped by Mingjiao——Moniguang Buddha. link with A2

D1 is in white clothes and white crown, holding a tin stick in his right hand, and holding two long objects over the shoulders in his left hand, suspected to be two locks of long hair, similar to a female monk. D2 is dressed as a monk, with a long robe and wide sleeves, his hands folded together, and his head is gleaming, as if he is a male monk. These two statues should represent the elect of Manichaeism. D1 D2
E : Engraved in the middle is a portrait standing on Yunfeng, wearing tight-sleeved plain clothes and short skirts, with exposed hands and feet, resembling a Huren costume. His hands are raised and opened flat, as if holding a torch; the hands are also tied with a fluttering silk ribbon, which "flutters" a specific pattern on both sides of the portrait. According to research, the statue is related to the Manichaeism worshiping light. link

The Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, also known as the Assumption Church, in Plattenville is a historic Roman Catholic church which was built in 1856. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
The area was settled by Canary Islanders and Acadians from 1779 on and the parish was formed in 1793 with its first church being "little more than a shack". It was replaced by a more permanent one in 1819, which in turn was replaced by this one in 1856, quite close to the site of the 1793 church. The parish's governing "Fabrique", or council of wardens, reportedly appointed a committee to measure the Catholic church in Thibodaux, Louisiana, andthen contracted with one Wilson Grisamore "to build a Church of Assumption for the amount of $13,500 after the plan of the Catholic church of Thibodaux (sic) using the same dimensions, with the bell tower being fifteen feet higher than the one at Thibodaux." This mid-century example of one-upmanship produced a competent English Gothic church which was rendered even more unique in its area by the burning of its model, St. Joseph's Church in Thibodaux, in 1916. The contracted cost of the new church was paid to Mr. Grisamore across a four year period, with an additional sum of $1129.48 being paid him for "extra work" in 1855, and the church seems to have been essentially complete by 1856.
The NRHP nomination describes the church as havinga pitched roof-basilican plan with a central square tower at the narthex. Adjacent to the tower is a stair leading to a small second-floor gallery. The five bay nave terminates in an apsidal chancel with one-story ancillary spaces. The exterior bearing walls are of brick with a timber roof and interior wood columns which were inspired by gothic compound colonettes. The exterior buttresses do not appear to be structural."
As of 1979 the church was approached by a gravel road, and it is located off Louisiana Highway 308.

The Juan Muguerza Cross-Country Race, also known as the Elgoibar Cross-Country Race, is an annual cross-country running competition which takes place each January in Elgoibar, the Basque Country, Spain. It is named as a memorial of local runner Juan Muguerza, a multiple national champion who was killed in 1937 during the bombing of Mungia in the Spanish Civil War.
The competition was first held in 1943 and was a men-only contest, principally between national-level runners. This changed at the 20th anniversary of the race in 1963, when the competition became an international one. Ethiopian runner Mamo Wolde was the first foreign winner and he went on to score three more victories that decade. His performances brought exposure for African runners in Spain and his influence was recognised with the erection of a memorial in his memory in 2003. Having been held every year since 1943, with the exception of cancellations in 1950 and 1981, the Cross Juan Muguerza is one of the longest-running competitions of its type in Spain.
The men's race has typically been contested over distances varying from 9 km to 11 km, with the current race being 10.8 km. A women's short course race was trialled in the late 1960s and became a permanent fixture of the programme in 1972. Initially a two kilometre course, the distance was gradually increased over the lifespan of the competition, resulting in the current distance of 6.6 km. A men's junior race was held in addition to the main senior race in 1963. The current race programme comprises the two senior races and six different age categories for younger runners.
The elite events attract the highest level of international runners, with past winners including IAAF World Cross Country Championships gold medallists Kenenisa Bekele, Paul Tergat, John Ngugi, Derartu Tulu and Edith Masai. The top runners of Spain and Portugal regularly compete at the competition. Among them, world medallists Mariano Haro and Carmen Valero won in Elgoibar in the 1970s, while prominent Portuguese athletes Paulo Guerra and Fernanda Ribeiro took the top honours in the 1990s.

George Henry Irving (October 5, 1874 – September 11, 1961) was an American film actor and director.
Career
Irving started his career as a theatre actor, notably as leading man to Maude Adams. He came to Hollywood in 1914 and acted in over 250 films from 1914 until 1948. Irving was initially an actor-director and directed about 35 silent films, which are mostly forgotten today. He switched exclusively to acting in the mid-1920s and became a character actor until the later 1940s.
Irving usually played reputable and stern persons of authority in supporting roles. He is perhaps best known for his roles as Robert Wentworth in Coquette (1929), and as the lawyer Alexander Peabody in Bringing Up Baby (1938). He ended his prolific career with two television roles in the 1950s.
Personal life
George Irving and his wife, Katherine Gilman, had two daughters, Katharine and Dorothy. He died from a heart attack in Hollywood in 1961, aged 86.

Eden Games (formerly known as Eden Studios) is a French video game developer based in Lyon, France, that mainly focuses on the development of racing video games.
History
The company was formed as a development group within Infogrames' European subsidiary Infogrames Multimedia, which had developed the first V-Rally for the PlayStation. The studio would later rebrand into its own separate studio, known as Eden Studios, with Infogrames holding a 19.2% minority share.
In April 2002, Infogrames fully acquired Eden Studios. During this period, the company would continue develop racing games such as Test Drive Unlimited and its sequel, Test Drive Unlimited 2, while also venturing into other game genres with games like Kya: Dark Lineage.
Atari announced that throughout April 2011, they had laid off over 51 of the 80 employees working at the studio, leading to a majority of the employees going on strike. In April 2012, Eden began negotiations as an attempt for separation from Atari due to accusation having been spread and its employees. On January 29, 2013, the studio filed for judicial liquidation.
On October 31, 2013, under the impulsion of former employees and with the financing of ID Invest and Monster Capital, Eden Games reopened as an independent game development studio without any involvement of Atari. The company then released its first game, GT Spirit, on Apple TV in December 2015. The game was later followed up with Gear.Club and two Nintendo Switch versions - Gear.Club Unlimited and Gear.Club Unlimited 2.
From 2017 to 2021, the company was a subsidiary of Engine Media.
In April 2022, Eden Games were acquired by the Hong Kong-based blockchain gaming company, Animoca Brands. According to Animoca, the Eden team will be integrated into their business and work on blockchain-based racing games and contribute to Animoca's existing titles build around its REVV crypto token.

"Crystalline" is a song by Icelandic artist Björk, released as the lead single from her eighth album Biophilia. The song was released as a single on 28 June 2011 accompanied by an iPad app developed exclusively for the song. It was afterward released as part of The Crystalline Series alongside the second single from the album, "Cosmogony".
Development
In March 2011, it was announced that Björk would play at the Manchester International Festival with a new concept of concert. Several songs from the album debuted during a series of performances at the festival between 27 June and 16 July 2011. Björk called the performances a "meditation on the relationship between music, nature and technology". "Special" instruments were designed and constructed specifically for these concerts.
The release of the song was preceded by three teasers: on the first one, entitled "Road to Crystalline" we can see Björk driving her Hummer through a road in Iceland while playing an excerpt of a demo version of the song; on the second one, we could see one of the new instruments developed for the Manchester performances, that also plays on the track: the 'Gameleste', a celesta which was modified by Icelandic Organ builder, Björgvin Tómasson and British Cymbalsmith and Gong maker, Matt Nolan so that it sounds like Gamelan and could be played remotely by MIDI or even an iPad; and on the third teaser, recording sessions of the remix featuring Omar Souleyman were shown. The song leaked onto the internet on 25 June 2011. On 28 June 2011, UK producers 16bit confirmed via Facebook that they produced the song.
"Crystalline" is a mostly electronic song, featuring a continuous 'gameleste' base and electronic beats and rhythm. After the bridge, the song features a gameleste solo, and consequently ends with a breakcore section which uses the Amen break. A review in The Guardian described the piece as a hybrid of the musical styles of her previous albums Post and Vespertine, with undercurrent percussive elements from her album Homogenic.
The lyrics to "Crystalline" talk about the process of crystallization in minerals and rocks but taking a more personal point of view, relating the growth of a crystal structure with the growth of relationships in people's hearts. Björk took inspiration for the song from cities and buildings:
Promotion
Music video
The music video for "Crystalline" was recorded on 26 May and was directed by long-time collaborator Michel Gondry. It was premiered on 26 July 2011 on YouTube. The video opens with a view of the moon and a meteor shower on it, forming different forms and crystals. Björk stars as a spectator of the meteor rain in the sky, as some kind of god. The video features heavy computer and stop-motion animation. Gondry explained about the video:
The video received a nomination at the Antville Music Video Awards, in the Best Art Direction category.
Apps
Every song on Biophilia has an app for iPhone or iPad. The main app was released on 19 July 2011, coinciding with the release of "Cosmogony", and it integrates all the songs' apps.
The app for "Crystalline" is a video game that uses the iPod Touch/iPhone/iPad's tilt feature to move a crystal through various tunnels. By collecting different crystals from the walls of the tunnel, new tunnels are unlocked, each one playing a different section of the song. Green tunnels play sections from the first verse, pink tunnels play sections from the second one, orange tunnels play sections from the third verse, red tunnels play the chorus and blue tunnels play the coda.
Live performances
Björk debuted the songs during a series of performances at the Manchester International Festival in England between 27 June and 16 July 2011. Björk performed Biophilia tracks and music from her back catalogue with a small group of musical collaborators, including Graduale Nobili, an Icelandic female choir. She performed "Crystalline" during every concert of the Biophilia Tour.
Björk performed the songs live on BBC2's Later... with Jools Holland. On 22 November 2011 the performance of "Crystalline" was broadcast, while the performances of "Cosmogony" and "Thunderbolt" were shown on 25 November.

Wallaceburg (2016 population 10,098) is an unincorporated community in the municipality of Chatham-Kent in Southern (Southwestern) Ontario, Canada. Originally a small settlement, it was recognized for its significant contribution to the lumber and boat building industries and strategic location along the banks of the scenic Sydenham River. In more recent years, 1895–1999, the town was known for its glass making industry. For that reason, Wallaceburg is locally known as the "glass town of Canada."
Wallaceburg is the home of WAMBO (Wallaceburg Antique Motor and Boat Outing), an annual antique car, boat, bus, and fire truck show that began in 1988.
History
The town was founded in the early 19th century and named after Scotland's national hero, Sir William Wallace. It was incorporated as a village in 1875 and then as a town in 1896. In 1998, it was amalgamated into the new municipality of Chatham–Kent.
The Baldoon settlement
The first settlers to the Wallaceburg area came in 1804. They initially settled along the Snye River at a location they called the Baldoon Settlement. Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk, provided an opportunity for poor farmers and peasants from Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland to come to what is now known as Wallaceburg to build better lives for themselves. He is often considered a great philanthropist for his efforts working with his poor countrymen. Unfortunately, the early Baldoon settlers faced a plethora of difficulties: malaria, harsh winters, marshland, lack of food, and American invaders during the War of 1812. By the 1820s, the settlement was deemed a failure by Lord Selkirk and other interested parties. The Baldoon settlers, however, did not give up; many of them contributed to the early success and development of the town of Wallaceburg.
The Baldoon mystery
The Baldoon Mystery is one of Ontario's greatest haunting stories, handed down by word of mouth. The strange events of this case are alleged to have occurred between 1829 and 1840, within a few kilometers of Wallaceburg, Ontario.
Industrial history
The town's first major industry was the lumber trade. It was highly successful during the mid- to late 19th century. The most notable business that developed during this era was the Wallaceburg Cooperage Company. It was opened by David Alexander Gordon and his uncle Captain James Steinhoff in 1887. By the end of the 19th century it was difficult to make large profits off of a declining hardwood supply. Industrialists needed to find other business ideas to sustain the local economy.
When historians think of Wallaceburg they often remember its three major modern industries: glass, brass, and sugar. In 1894 the Sydenham Glass Company began. The glassmaking industry in Wallaceburg lasted over 100 years. The factory closed in 1999. This left approximately 1000 workers unemployed.
Another notable industry was the Canadian and Dominion Sugar Company. It was opened in 1901. The company was known for producing raw sugar from sugar beets. It closed in 1960.
The Wallaceburg Brass Company was the third staple industry. It opened in 1905 and was famous for creating brass faucets and plumbing supplies. The company later merged with Kindred industries, founded by Robbert Hartog, and was known thereafter as known as Waltec. The factory stopped manufacturing in Wallaceburg as late as 2006.
The Lee rifle prototype
In 1878, James Paris Lee (1832–1904) and his brother John perfected a rifle with a box magazine in Wallaceburg. This rifle later became an antecedent to the famous Lee–Enfield rifle. A well trained gunman could fire approximately 15-30 shots a minute. The prototype was tested successfully in Wallaceburg and is currently housed at the Wallaceburg and District Museum.
Tourist attractions
Wallaceburg is home to a number of attractions and yearly events. Tourists come to Wallaceburg to experience fishing, hunting, golf, and pleasure boating. Fisherman enjoys a variety of species, including bass, walleye, perch, pike, muskie, trout, and panfish. Hunters take pleasure in searching for the area's abundant population of water fowl, deer, and rabbits. Boaters enjoy a vast array of rivers and lakes. There is still water for knee boarders and wake boarders. There is also open water nearby for those who enjoy sailing and scuba diving.
The Wallaceburg and District Museum documents the history of Wallaceburg, starting with the area's First Nations groups dating back thousands of years. It then moves to the first European settlement started by Lord Selkirk's Baldoon settlers, in 1804. However, the museum's current major focus is on the community's rich industrial heritage. Some of the major industries highlighted include glass, brass, and sugar.
The museum is also home to the Wallaceburg Sports Hall of Fame and a number of other temporary and rotating exhibits. Arguably the most internationally significant artifact on display is the Lee Rifle prototype, the precursor to the Lee–Enfield Rifle. This dates back to 1878 and was invented and perfected in Wallaceburg by James Paris and John Lee. The first shots of the rifle were believed to be taken at the Lee Foundry on the banks of the Sydenham River.
The community also hosts a number of annual events that attract people from around North America. WAMBO is the most notable and is commented on at length below. Live theatre can be experienced at various times during the year. The Jeanne Gordon Theatre puts on at least two productions annually.
Wallaceburg is only minutes from Uncle Tom's Cabin, and is within an hour's drive of Blenheim, Point Pelee National Park, and Rondeau Provincial Park.
WAMBO
The Wallaceburg Antique Motor and Boat Outing is Wallaceburg's largest annual summer festival and was started in 1988. It is the largest transportation show in Canada. It takes place on the second weekend in August every year. The event attracts approximately 30 000 visitors to see the boats, cars, motorcycles, airplanes, fire trucks, tractors, and various other antique vehicles.
In addition to antique vehicle exhibitions, WAMBO also includes a number of other significant events, including a car dream cruise, soap box races, a toy show, art in the park, live bands, food vendors, art and craft vendors, pioneer crafts at the museum, camping in Crothers Park, and free admission to the Wallaceburg and District Museum.
Education
School boards serving the community include Lambton Kent District School Board, the St. Clair Catholic District School Board, the Conseil scolaire catholique Providence (CSC Providence), and the Conseil scolaire Viamonde.
Wallaceburg has six elementary schools and a high school. The public elementary schools are A.A. Wright, and H.W. Burgess. The Catholic elementary schools include St. Elizabeth, Holy Family, and Christ the King. There is also Wallaceburg Christian School. Wallaceburg District Secondary School is the town's high school.

Signal operating instructions (SOI) or Communications-Electronics Operation Instructions (CEOI) are U.S. military terms for a type of combat order issued for the technical control and coordination of communications within a command. They include current and up-to-date information covering radio call signs and frequencies, a telephone directory, code-words (for rudimentary encryption), and visual and sound signals. A designated battalion signal officer prepares the battalion SOI in conformance with the SOI of higher headquarters. During operations, SOI are changed daily. Since the fielding of the SINCGARS system, however, the paper SOI has generally faded from Army use. Electronic SOI are now generated, distributed and loaded along with cryptographic keys.
The title SOI was used until the early 1970s and it was changed to CEOI and then changed back to SOI in the 1980s.

Wonder Gadot (foaled May 22, 2015) is a Canadian Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning the Queen's Plate and Prince of Wales Stakes, the first two legs of the Canadian Triple Crown, in 2018. As a two-year-old, she was named the Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Filly after winning the Mazarine and Demoiselle Stakes. At age three, in addition to beating the colts twice in Canada, she was second in the Grade I Kentucky Oaks to Monomoy Girl. She was named the 2018 Canadian Horse of the Year and Champion Three-Year-Old Filly.
Background
Wonder Gadot is a dark bay filly bred in Ontario by Anderson Farms. Her sire is Medaglia d'Oro, who won four Grade I races during his racing career, including the Travers Stakes in 2002 and the 2003 Whitney Handicap. He was also the runner-up in the 2002 Belmont Stakes and the 2004 Dubai World Cup. Medaglia d'Oro was retired to stud in 2005 and became a successful stallion who finished second on the American general sires list in 2015 and has finished in the top ten five other times. His other major runners include Rachel Alexandra, Songbird, Plum Pretty, Bolt d'Oro, Mshawish, Violence, and Vancouver. Wonder Gadot's dam Loving Vindication raced from 2007 to 2010, primarily in allowance company. She won two of her 13 races; one a victory in a maiden special weight at Belmont Park and the other an allowance win at Saratoga. In January 2011, she sold as a broodmare prospect to Anderson Farms for $180,000. Loving Vindication's first foal, a full brother to Wonder Gadot named Solemn Tribute, is a stakes winner who won the Tropical Park Derby in 2015 and finished second in the King Edward Stakes in 2016. Loving Vindication has also produced a 2016 Hard Spun filly named Hard Not to Love, the winner of the 2019 La Brea Stakes, a 2017 colt by Bodemeister, and a 2018 filly by Nyquist.
As a yearling, Anderson Farms sold Wonder Gadot at Keeneland September for $80,000 to Eisaman Equine. She was then pinhooked, or re-sold for a higher price, at the Ocala Breeders' Sale in April 2018. Gary Barber, former chairman and CEO of MGM, purchased her for $325,000 and sent her into training with Mark Casse, a member of the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.
Wonder Gadot is named for the actress Gal Gadot, who played Wonder Woman in the 2017 film of the same name.
Racing career
2017: two-year-old season
Wonder Gadot's career debut was at Woodbine Racetrack on August 26, 2017. In an unusual first step, Wonder Gadot was not entered in a maiden special weight for her first race, but an allowance race against fillies who had raced before. In the seven-furlong turf race, Wonder Gadot stalked the pace set by 32–1 longshot Without a Doubt, overtaking her entering the stretch and drawing away to win by four lengths.
Wonder Gadot made her next start in the Grade I Natalma Stakes, run at a distance of one mile on the turf. She went off as the 2–1 favorite in a field of nine that included fillies from Canada, America and Europe. At the start, Golden Orb bumped into Capla Temptress, who in turn bumped into Wonder Gadot. Wonder Gadot then settled in midpack for the first half mile before making her move around the final turn. However, she could not match the finishing kick of Capla Temptress and finished third.
On October 7, Wonder Gadot went off as the even-money favorite in a field of four in the Mazarine Stakes. Running for the first time on Woodbine's Tapeta (artificial dirt) surface, she went straight to the early lead and set an easy pace. Down the stretch, she drew away from the field to win by six lengths. Jockey Patrick Husbands commented that though she was more relaxed on the turf, "she's the real deal" on the main track.
The win encouraged her connections to enter her in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies at Del Mar Racetrack on November 4. After racing far back early, she encountered traffic problems and could only finish sixth. On December 2, she bounced back to win the Demoiselle Stakes on the main track at Aqueduct Racetrack by lengths after stalking the early pace. "I was happy where she put me," said her new jockey, John Velazquez. "She was going very comfortable and got away from the horses pretty easily. She has a beautiful stride. I was very happy with the way she did it."
With her record of three wins (each coming on a different track surface) and a third from five starts, Wonder Gadot won the Sovereign Award for Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Filly.
2018: three-year-old season
Wonder Gadot began her three-year-old career in the United States, attempting to qualify on the Road to the Kentucky Oaks, the filly's equivalent of the Kentucky Derby. Although she was winless in her four prep races, she was consistently in the money, finishing second in the Silverbulletday and Fantasy, and third in the Rachel Alexandra and Fair Grounds Oaks. In the Kentucky Oaks, Wonder Gadot stalked the early pace then dueled down the stretch with Monomoy Girl, closing at one point to within a head of the lead. Nearing the finish line, the two fillies bumped repeatedly, causing Wonder Gadot to switch leads. Monomoy Girl crossed the finish line a half length in front and the stewards decided to let the results stand. "I think it was going to be really close," said Casse. "But I think the stewards made the right call. To take a horse down in this type of race, I think it has to be pretty significant. As much I would have liked to have won, I understand the ruling."
On June 9, Wonder Gadot returned to Woodbine Oaks to contest the Woodbine Oaks, Canada's most prestigious race for three-year-old fillies. She went off as the 2–5 favorite. She broke poorly and settled well back, then made a wide move on the far turn to move into contention. However, Dixie Moon got a "great trip" along the rail and held off Wonder Gadot down the stretch to win by a head.
Prior to the Queen's Plate, Casse opted to put blinkers on Wonder Gadot in order to help her focus after several narrow losses. "It's tough to make that kind of call," said Casse. "Finally we just said, 'Look we've got to do it.' She has been so unlucky but she's so tough." Complicating matters, the area surrounding Woodbine Racetrack was under an extreme heat warning with temperatures of and a humidex of . Casse told Barber before the race that "[the heat] will help her, because it's going to affect others, but it's not going to affect her."
In the Queen's Plate, Wonder Gadot was the 3–1 second choice on the morning line, going off at post time as the 2–1 favorite. Breaking from post 11, she tracked the pace set by stablemate Telekinesis from mid-pack and began to close ground around the far turn. Entering the stretch, Wonder Gadot took the lead and drew away to win by lengths over 28–1 longshot Aheadbyacentury. With her victory, she became the fourth filly in eight years to win the Queen's Plate.
Following the race, Casse took care to cool down Wonder Gadot, fearing that she was having trouble catching her breath in the extreme heat. He compared her to 2014 Queen's Plate winner Lexie Lou, whom he also trained. "She reminds me a lot of Lexie Lou even though she probably weighs 200 pounds more than Lexie did but Lexie just thrived on running," he said. "There are horses that will just run and run and run and luckily this is one of them." He also stated that he was considering running Wonder Gadot in the Prince of Wales Stakes, the second leg of the Canadian Triple Crown, alongside Flameaway, a horse who previously ran in the 2018 Kentucky Derby.
Ultimately, Wonder Gadot made her next start in the Prince of Wales as Casse's sole entry in the six-horse race. Casse was concerned that Wonder Gadot would not be able to handle the sloppy track making her first start at Fort Erie Race Track and seriously considered scratching her from the race. However, he opted to keep her in and she was sent off as the 2–5 favorite. Wonder Gadot broke well and went out to an early lead, and was pressured by Cooler Mike on the backstretch while the remainder of the field lagged behind. On the far turn, Wonder Gadot began to open up a solid lead and was not seriously challenged in the stretch, winning by lengths over second choice Aheadbyacentury.
Casse and Barber's original plan was for Wonder Gadot to run in the Alabama Stakes on August 18, the same day as the Breeders' Stakes, the final leg of the Canadian Triple Crown. Following Wonder Gadot's Prince of Wales win, Casse said the possibility of a Canadian Triple Crown attempt was something he would discuss with Barber. He stated that his ultimate goal was a rematch with Monomoy Girl before the end of the year and a chance at the Eclipse Award for American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly. However, on July 28, it was announced that Wonder Gadot would make her next start in the Travers Stakes on August 25, becoming the first female starter in that race since Davona Dale in 1979. She raced close to the early pace but tired in the stretch and finished last.
Wonder Gadot then finished third in the Cotillion Stakes on September 22 behind Midnight Bisou and Monomoy Girl. She made her final start of the year in the Breeders' Cup Distaff on November 3, where she set the early pace before tiring in the stretch to finish ninth.
At the Sovereign Award ceremony held in April 2019, Wonder Gadot was named the 2018 Canadian Horse of the Year and Champion Three-Year-Old Filly.
2019: four-year-old campaign
Wonder Gadot made her four-year-old debut in an allowance race at Oaklawn Park on March 8. She raced in fifth place before starting her move on the far turn. She briefly took the lead but was passed in the stretch by Go Google Yourself and finished second. In the Apple Blossom Handicap, she instead went to the early lead but tired and finished sixth behind Midnight Bisou.
In June, Casse announced that Wonder Gadot had been retired.

The Person Dignity Theory () was a Vietnamese political doctrine and ideology coined by Ngô Đình Nhu in 1954, based on Emmanuel Mounier's works. It was also the official ideology of the Cần Lao Party, a former political party.
Doctrine
The Cần Lao Party's leader Ngô Đình Nhu created this ideology to oppose the ideology of the Vietnamese Communist Party. The Person Dignity Theory proposed a "third way" between capitalism and communism, both of which it accused of being strictly materialist. Both capitalism and communism assume that people are only instruments of production, while the Person Dignity Theory promoted a spiritual and physical person, with consequential changes for supply and demand based not on the individual but on the community.
The Personal Dignity Theory is based on "Three Theories":
Personalism
Community (the community's good)
Spiritual (as opposed to materialism)
The Person Dignity Theory emphasized the well-being of the community. The ideal community, as the theory postulated, was based on family, society, nation, humanity and nature. The spiritual was believed to strengthen the community and move further towards "truth, compassion, unity". To realize the Person Dignity Theory, a political party was needed to promote the ideology, as well as achieving social justice and technological modernization which the theory saw as important.
International link
The Person Dignity Theory drew inspiration from many world leaders, such as Juan Perón of Argentina, Carlos Castillo Armas of Guatemala, Sukarno of Indonesia, António de Oliveira Salazar of Portugal, Francisco Franco of Spain and Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia.

A clothes shop or clothes store is any shop which sells items of ready-made clothing. A small shop which sells expensive or designer clothing may be called a boutique. A shop that sells clothes for a narrowlyrestricted market such as school uniforms or outdoor sports may be called an outfitter.
History
It is not known when the first clothes shops were opened in Europe. Before the era of ready-made clothes, when clothing was made by tailors or artisans, shops may have sold second-hand clothing. Some ready-made clothes may have been made in the sixteenth century. The number of clothes shops appears to have risen steadily long before the beginning of large-scale industrial manufacture of clothing in the second half of the nineteenth century.

}}George Mayer-Marton' (3 June 1897 – 8 August 1960) was a Hungarian Jewish artist who was a significant figure in Viennese art between the First and Second World Wars, working in oil, watercolour and graphics. Following his forced emigration to England in 1938, he continued to paint in watercolour and oil. He pioneered the technique of Byzantine mosaic in the UK.
Biography
Mayer-Marton was born György, or Georg in German, later changed to George on British naturalization, in Győr, Kingdom of Hungary in 1897, and grew up during the final years of Austro-Hungary. He served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War. From 1919 to 1924 he studied art at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna and Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, and also visited Ravenna in Italy. He settled in Vienna, and in 1927 became Secretary, later Vice-President, of the leading progressive society of Viennese artists, the Hagenbund. In 1928 he provided illustrations in the Chinese style for Der Kreidekreis ("The Chalk Circle") by Klabund and submitted paintings to the art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics, but did not win a medal.
In 1938 following the Anschluss of Austria and the enactment of Hitler's Nuremberg laws, Mayer-Marton and his wife, the pianist Grete Fried, fled to England. In 1940, during the London Blitz, his studio home in St John's Wood was burnt by an incendiary bomb. The majority of his life's work and personal possessions was destroyed. He was not in a position to paint in oil again until 1948. Mayer-Marton's parents had remained in Gyor and were eventually deported and killed. When, in 1945, Mayer-Marton learned of their deaths he painted the work Women with Boulders, showing two figures in a bleak rock-strewn landscape.
Once in the UK Mayer-Marton worked for the predecessor of the Arts Council. In 1952, he took up the post of Senior Lecturer in the department of painting at the Liverpool College of Art and introduced the new subject of mural art.
Mayer-Marton was the first to introduce the technique of Byzantine-style/facetted mosaics in the UK and executed a number of mural commissions from the Roman Catholic Church, decorating schools and churches in the North West of England. The Roman Catholic church of Holy Rosary in Fitton Hill, Oldham, opened in 1955, contains a significant mural. It is 8 m high and originally included frescos showing Mary and St John with a mosaic showing the crucifixion in the centre. The frescos were painted over with white emulsion paint in 1980. The church was closed in 2017 and was used for storage. An application for listing, submitted in August 2020 by Nick Braithwaite, the artist's great-nephew, and supported by SAVE Britain's Heritage, was considered by Historic England and in August 2022 the church was given Grade II listed status but not before it had been vandalised.
The other ecclesiastical mural by Mayer-Marton that survives in situ is above the high altars inside St Clare's RC Church in Blackley, which depicts Clare of Assisi. A mosaic by Mayer-Marton of the Pentecost was moved from the Church of the Holy Ghost, Netherton, when it was demolished in 1989 and installed in the Chapel of Unity in Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral.
He completed over 200 oil paintings while in Liverpool. Numerous works are held in private collections and also in public art galleries including: the Victoria and Albert Museum London; British Museum, London; Österreichische Galerie Belvedere Vienna; Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea; Victoria Gallery & Museum Liverpool; the Imperial War Museum London; the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool; Derby Museum and Art Gallery; National Galleries of Scotland and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art.
Mayer-Marton died from leukaemia in Liverpool in August 1960, leaving several of his mosaic designs unfinished.

Women's Health Protective Association (sometimes, Woman's Health Protective Association; original parent body, Ladies' Health Protective Association) was a US women's organization focused on improving a city's public health and protecting the immediate neighborhood. It was founded in New York City in November 1884 as the Ladies' Health Protective Association.
The impetus for the association occurred when a few women were annoyed by a nuisance maintained in the immediate neighborhood of their homes. They assembled in the parlor of one of the women to talk over the situation and devise some plan of concerted effort that could be brought to bear upon the New York City Metropolitan Board of Health to induce it to abate this nuisance. The result led to the formation of "The Ladies' Health Protective Association." It commanded public attention because its work was public and for the public. The meetings became important enough to have reporters assigned from the daily papers attend them, and reports appeared.
Associations were formed in other cities on the same general principles. The newer associations substituted the word "woman," or "women," for " ladies," although the original charter granted by New York State was to "The Ladies' Health Protective Association." By 1895, the parent body decided, in view of the prejudices against the use of the word "lady", to change its name to The Woman's Health Protective Association.
Manhattan, New York
In November, 1884, eleven women residing on Beekman Hill, whose houses were located on a high bluff overlooking the East River, were so outraged at the continuance of the foul odors which polluted the atmosphere of the entire neighborhood, causing them to keep windows closed in the hottest weather, and depriving them of their right to pure air, that they resolved to investigate the cause of this nuisance. Accordingly, they made a tour of the neighborhood, in that section of the city known as the abattoir district, which extends on First Avenue from Forty-third Street to 47th Street. Their first visit was a revelation, and while they returned to their homes ill from the inspection and the discovery of the nuisance, they decided that some action must be taken to better the conditions. The following morning their number was increased to fifteen, and it was resolved that these women should form themselves into an organization, to be known as the Ladies' Health Protective Association.
They found that relief would require more than protests, and probably a struggle of some months, at least, with official greed and public indifference. For efficiency, they formed an association afterwards christened "The Ladies Health Protective Association of New York". Only after ten years of persistent effort was their original purpose accomplished. In the meantime, however, they accomplished other things no less important. They demonstrated woman's power and fitness to cope with these questions. They formed committees to investigate the water supply, gas houses, school hygiene, street cleaning, garbage disposal, sewer system, sanitation of prisons and tenements, and in several instances influenced the legislature to pass sanitary laws. The group's first convention occurred May 14–15, 1896 at the New York Academy of Medicine.
A marble stele and drinking fountain, designed by Bruno Louis Zimm were placed at Riverside Drive and 116th Street in 1909 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the organization.
Brooklyn, New York
The Brooklyn association was organized in March, 1890, and incorporated April 2, 1890, with a voluntary secretary. Annual dues of US$1 supported the society. There 25 members of the board of directors, with an executive committee of seven, meeting once a month. The departments of work were: municipal, legal, lecture, press, and house. The Association had no organ of its own, but came in touch with its workers, who could attend the monthly meetings of the board of directors. The society was non-partisan and had neighborhood or branch associations in election districts.
Some of its accomplishments were: cleaner streets, because of boxes for waste placed on the street-corners; cleaner cars, due to placards prohibiting spitting on the floor; increased interest in the cleanliness and health of the city on the part of the women; and the initial movement resulting in the overthrow of the ring rule in 1893. In 1893, they played an important role in the election of Hon. Charles A. Schieren for mayor.
The Association originated in the thought of its president, who desired to see Brooklyn made a cleaner and more attractive city, through a more patriotic interest on the part of the women. A meeting was called to consider to what extent women are responsible for the condition of the streets, and that conference led to the organization of the Women's Health Protective Association of Brooklyn, somewhat on the lines of the older Association of the same name in New York. It grew steadily in four years, numbering 450 paying members, while a much larger number were actively engaged in extending its influence and carrying out its principles. In 1896, there were 1,000 members with five local branches.
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
The Woman's Health Protective Association of Philadelphia organized in 1893 as a committee of the New Century Club. This association seems to have established its work on a broader and more comprehensive basis and extended its influence along longer lines than others.
The first committee to get to work was that on contagious diseases, whose activities included the endorsement of a bill in the state legislature providing for inspection of all cattle farms in the state, with reference to their sanitary condition and the prevention of tuberculosis; also, the establishment of a pay hospital for contagious diseases. The street cleaning and garbage committee personally visited the slum districts every week. Other committees included water supply and a sweating system. A trolley committee urged the importance to public health of running more cars, to avoid overcrowding, of vestibules for protection of motormen, the adopting of fenders, longer straps to accommodate women and children, and conspicuous signs forbidding expectoration. A literature committee studied the literature of the day for all matters pertaining to sanitary subjects.
National organization
A national convention was held in Philadelphia May 3, 1897, with delegates from forty clubs and societies, the majority representing health protective or village improvement associations. The Woman's Health Protective Association of the United States was formed, with Olive Pond Amies as president.

Realm of the Desert Sons () is a German-style board game published in 2008 by Klaus Teuber, published by Kosmos in Germany. It is the second game in the Entdecker trilogy of games, a series of games featuring the mechanics of Teuber's previous game, Entdecker, adapted to new themes. Unlike the previous game, Realm of the Jade Goddess, Desert Sons was available for a wide release, though there are no plans to publish the game outside of the original German language. However, a computer implementation has been available on the Catan GmbH website, with a full English language translation.
Desert Sons is considered to be the middle game in terms of complexity in the trilogy, roughly on par with the original Entdecker.
Gameplay
The game takes place on a board 11 tiles wide by 11 tiles tall. Initially, only the tiles in the middle row and column are uncovered. Each tile consists of portions of desert and oasis, with connecting lines in brown or white through the centers of each tile (brown through desert portions and white through oasis portions). In addition, oasis portions may contain "action icons", which are used in the game.
Each player begins the game with a camel representing the player's caravan, and four explorers of different heights. The heights of explorers of different players are also different, but such that the total height of a player's four explorers are the same. At the start of the turn, players place their camels on the first or last tiles on the middle row or column, with each player placing their camel on different tiles. Each player is also given one tile in reserve, and two water stones, which act as the game's currency.
At the start of each turn, the player may first move their camel. Camels may freely move along the brown lines, but must stop once the camel moves over a white line; once per game, a player may pay one water stone in order to freely move the camel along the white lines. Camels may not be placed on tiles where occupied by other camels, but may move over them. If the camel ends at a location facing unexplored terrain (where no tile exists), discovery occurs and the player may either draw a tile and place it or place a tile from their reserve. Once per game, the player may also pay one water stone to place a tile from another player's reserve (the player then draws a new tile and place it in their reserve). Tiles placed must be adjacent to the camel's position, such that the lines connecting it to neighboring tiles are of the same color, and such that tiles placed on the edge of the game board are placed with the desert sides out (as if the edge of the board has a brown connecting line); if no such placement is possible the tile is placed in the player's reserve, and the player's turn ends. If a new tile is placed, the camel is then moved to the newly discovered tile. If the tile is entirely composed of desert, the player may move the caravan again and place tiles, if necessary.
After discovery occurs, the players may either place an explorer on the newly discovered tile, or remove an explorer already on the board. Explorers must be placed on oasis sections of tiles, and may not be placed on the same portion as an action icon. Oases are considered complete if they are entirely surrounded by desert or the edge of the game board, when they are scored. If there are at least two explorers (even if they belong to the same player) in the completed oasis, the player with the tallest explorer must pay one water stone or remove the explorer from further scoring. Each explorer then claims an action icon by order of their height; if there are not enough action icons for all the explorers the remainder get nothing. Then, after each player then takes the action indicated by the action icon, the explorers are returned to the player's reserves. (As all explorers are of different heights, one explorer is always taller than the others. To counteract this, one player is given the turban, which is assigned to the player's tallest explorer. The explorer with the turban is always considered to be the tallest regardless of its actual height, and the turban is passed around when the explorer with the turban is involved in the scoring of an oasis.)
Action icons allow players to earn water stones, claim one of four merchandise items and place it in their caravans (which initially may hold four items), expand the capacity of their caravan by two items, or place a "rumor tile" on a small board. If in the event a player with a full caravan claims a merchandise item, they may discard the newly acquired merchandise item or discard a caravan item to make room. Rumor tiles add or subtract the victory point value of each item of merchandise by up to two points. There are six rumor tiles, but only two rumor tiles may be assigned to a particular merchandise item. Players may look at a rumor tile when they are placed, but they are placed face-down on a special rumor board that keeps track of the merchandise values. If all six rumor tiles are in place and a player chooses a rumor tile action, they may remove a rumor tile, which can be replaced by a later rumor tile action.
Once per game, the player may pay one water stone to take a second turn at the conclusion of their turn.
The game ends when the last tile is played, and one last turn is taken by each player. The rumor tiles are turned face-up, and the player with the greatest total value of merchandise wins, with the number of water stones as a tiebreaker.

History
During the early 1900s the growth of civil aviation and commercial airlines created the need for their regulation and oversight. In 1919 with the creation of the first Colombian airline, SCADTA, the need for regulation led the government to take the first of such steps. On 31 December 1919, President Marco Fidel Suárez sanctioned Law 126 of 1919, which became the first form of legislation in the country dealing with aviation, making aviation companies, and everything related to aviation subject to government regulations.
On 2 November 1933 during the administration of President Enrique Olaya Herrera, Decree 1080 of 1933 was passed. This decree ascribed matters of civil aviation to the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the next year however, Decree 1682 of 1934, expedited by the new elect President Alfonso López Pumarejo, ascribed it to the Ministry of War. The Ministry of War now controlled all aspects of aviation in the country, military by the Air Force, and civil by the Department of Civil Aviation (Departamento de Aviación Civil).
As aviation became popular, and new international and national flight routes were created, the government saw the need to create a more organized and independent agency to oversee civil aviation. Was then that Congress passed Law 80 of 1938, which created the Directorate General for Civil Aviation (Dirección General de Aeronáutica), centralizing the management of civil aviation into one agency. The agency was still part of the Ministry of War, but had gained more independence in management and finances, and was now in charge of the operations of aerodromes, airways, aeronautic radiocommunications, meteorology, and oversight.
On 18 October 1951 a change of name and command was implemented during the administration of President Laureano Gómez, who by means of Decree 1956 of 1951, created the National Department of Civil Aviation (Departamento Nacional de Aeronáutica Civil), replacing the name and placing it under the authority of the Ministry of Public Works.
On 18 June 1960, the National Government created by Decree 1721 of 1960 the Civil Aviation Department (Departamento Administrativo de Aeronáutica Civil, DAAC), which was assigned specific technical and administrative duties to define aeronautic policy. In 1992 the DAAC merged with the National Aeronautic Fund (Fondo Aeronáutico Nacional), broadening its services and responsibilities.
On 30 December 1993, the Colombian Congress passed Law 105 of 1993'', which created the Civil Aviation Authority of Colombia. It replaced the DAAC and was placed under the administration of the Ministry of Transportation. The agency officially went into operation on 1 February 1994, with officials being sworn in again, and 450 employees laid off.

Conquests of Camelot: The Search for the Grail is a graphic adventure game released in 1990 by Sierra On-Line. It was the first game in the Conquests series designed by Christy Marx and her husband Peter Ledger. The only other game in the series was 1991's Conquests of the Longbow: The Legend of Robin Hood. Marx did the majority of the design work while Ledger created the game and package art.
Gameplay
The gameplay is typical of the Sierra adventure games of that time, including several action sequences, puzzles and riddles. Occasionally, some alternative solutions to puzzles are available.
Scoring is based on three kinds of points: Skill (when the player performs deeds that help him in his quest, or defeats enemies), Wisdom (when examining things, talking to others, or gaining hints) and Soul (performing good deeds to help others). The options provide a difficulty setting for the action sequences, but with lower points. The game features a soundtrack of authentic-sounding medieval music composed by Mark Seibert.
The message boxes (narration) are the wizard Merlin speaking and counseling the player. The in-game text displays lesser-known forms of words, for example Gwenhyver, Excaliber, Gawaine, Launcelot, and magick instead of the better-known Guinevere, Excalibur, Gawain, Lancelot, and magic. The parser, however, understands all spellings.
The package includes a map of Europe in Arthurian times and an illustrated manual called Liber Ex Doctrina (Latin for either "Book (derived) from Knowledge" or "Book of Doctrine"). This book includes information about the evolution of the Arthurian and Grail myths as well as Greek and Roman mythology; some of this information is required in order to answer riddles within the game.
Plot
The game begins at the decline of Camelot because of the love triangle between King Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot. This 'curse' brought famine and drought in the kingdom. After having a vision of the Holy Grail covered by a silver cloth, Gawain, Lancelot and Galahad departed on a quest for the Holy Grail. However, they did not return. The player controls Arthur in his search for the missing knights and the Grail.
The adventure begins at Camelot and then the player travels across England. On his way to Glastonbury Tor he is challenged to a joust by a Black Knight before rescuing Gawain. In the ruins of the Tor he meets a mad hermit, a monk who serves the "Old Ones" and claims he has the Grail, left by Joseph of Arimathea. Afterwards, he visits Ot Moor where the frozen (due to the curse) Lady of the Lake challenges Arthur to a riddle in order to rescue the imprisoned Lancelot.
From Southampton, Arthur leaves England in order to follow Galahad's traces. He arrives to Gaza where he is hosted by a man called Al Sirat, who will introduce him to the cult of the Six Goddesses. At Jerusalem Arthur is tried throughout his acts of selflessness and helping people. After traversing a series of perilous catacombs, the player reaches the ancient Temple of Aphrodite where the goddess directs him to the Grail.
Historical references
The game is marked by folkloric knowledge that is woven between the dialogues and the descriptions as the plot unfolds. When the player moves the cursor around the map of England, Merlin will comment on legendary figures such as Brutus of Troy or Ascapart and early legendary saints. In the scenery representing the ruins of Glastonbury Tor, there is a Glastonbury Thorn, which Merlin mentions originated with the Joseph of Arimathea. There is also a well, the lid of which resembles the Chalice Well. Before reaching Jerusalem, Arthur has a stop at the Pool of Siloam.
Themes
A theme seen throughout the game is the intermediate period of Sub-Roman Britain before Christianity, as a new religion, replaces the old ones. In Camelot there is a Chapel dedicated both to Mithras (who is however represented by a labarum) for the soldiers of Roman heritage, and Jesus Christ for the Christian soldiers. Cernunnos and Aphrodite are portrayed as real gods, but their powers and influence are in decline because of the advent of Christianity. In the ending sequence of the game, the Grail obliterates the purported "symbol of Mithras" in the chapel. The Grail's power seems to be universal both as a Christian relic and an artifact (the cauldron) of feminine power of the Goddess in pagan folklore.
Another theme interwoven with the gameplay is that Arthur is supposed to perform good deeds to prove himself worthy of the Grail. In the Jerusalem sequence, the player has to discern the locals' problems and help them in order to advance the game. If the player decides not to help even one of his knights and thus avoid the trials and action sequences, the game can be completed, but the Grail will kill Arthur at the very end of the game.
Reception
In the July 1990 edition of Games International (issue 16), Theo Clarke stated that "Conquests of Camelot has a delicacy that is unusual in this field. There is little overt humour but a gentle wit pervades the game", but felt that the EGA graphics needed to be upgraded. Nevertheless Clarke concluded by giving the game excellent ratings of 9 out of 10 for both gameplay and graphics, saying the game was "a refreshing, challenging adventure game which should appeal strongly to those with a taste for medieval romance".
In the July–August 1990 edition of Computer Gaming World, Scorpia stated that Conquests of Camelots EGA graphics were inferior to those of previous Sierra games, and she did not recommend the game to more experienced adventurers because of the low difficulty level of the puzzles.
In the August 1990 Dragon (Issue 160), Hartley, Patricia and Kirk Lesser called this "a beautifully crafted animated adventure. Sierra, long recognized as a leader in the animated adventure market, continues to lead the way with offerings such as this colorful journey to the time of King Arthur". They concluded by giving the game an excellent rating of 4½ out of 5, saying, "Conquests of Camelot is yet another 'must buy' from the talented folk at Sierra".

The MRT Pink Line is an elevated mass rapid transit monorail train line under construction in Bangkok and Nonthaburi Province, Thailand. The monorail line will be long and have 30 stations. It will run in the northern part of the city from the Nonthaburi Civic Center in Pak Kret District Nonthaburi along the major east–west transport corridor of Chaeng Wattana and Ram Intra roads to terminate at Minburi District in east Bangkok.
The line is designed to link the northern areas of Bangkok and Nonthaburi by connecting with five mass transit lines. At Nonthaburi Civic Center the line interchanges with the MRT Purple Line and the proposed MRT Brown Line. The line also interchanges with the SRT Dark Red Line, the BTS Sukhumvit Line and the planned BMA Grey Line. At the Min Buri terminus, the line interchanges with the under construction MRT Orange Line.
Construction of the MRT Pink Line began in December 2017. In October 2020, the BSR consortium stated that they aimed to open the first section of the Pink Line by October 2021, with services initially operating from Min Buri (PK30) to Government Complex (PK12). The complete line was originally set to be fully open by June 2022. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 in Bangkok and changes to station locations has delayed the opening date. On 24 September 2021, the MRTA Board granted a 290-day extension to the construction contract period. In November 2021, the MRTA Board approved a new phased opening of the line starting from August 2022. On 9 December 2021, daily testing conducted at a maximum speed of 25 km/h began on a short 4 km section of the line between the depot at Min Buri and Bang Chan station. After a period of 3 months, testing will be conducted at higher speeds and along a longer section of track.
However, in mid April 2022 the acting Director-General of the Department of Rail Transport stated that the line would not begin full testing until September 2022 and that the first stage would not open until late December 2022. By the end of March 2022, construction progress is at 86.51%. The line will open in three stages.
Phase 1: December 2022 - Min Buri (PK30) to Government Complex (PK12) (except Nopparat (PK26)) - 21 km
Phase 2: March 2023 - Government Complex (PK12) to Royal Irrigation Department (PK05) - 8 km
Phase 3: July 2023 - Royal Irrigation Department (PK05) to Nonthaburi Civic Center (PK01) - 5.5 km
Route Alignment
The line begins at Nonthaburi Civic Center near Khae Rai Junction, Nonthaburi Province, in the northwest of Greater Bangkok. The line then heads north along Tiwanon Road to Pak Kret Intersection, Pak Kret District, before turning east to run along Chaeng Watthana road. It interchanges with the SRT Dark Red Line at Lak Si Station and passes over Vibhavadi Rangsit Road running east through the Ram Intra intersection and the Lak Si monument in Bang Khen District, where it crosses under the BTS Sukhumvit Line and interchanges with Wat Phra Sri Mahathat. The line then continues farther east along Ram Intra Road to the northeast of Bangkok before terminating at Min Buri where it finally interchanges with the MRT Orange Line at Min Buri station (OR28).
History
The MRT Pink Line was first proposed in 2005 by the Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning as a heavy rail underground line. It was changed to a monorail line in 2008 to reduce construction costs. The director-general of the Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning had previously stated in an interview that the Pink Line was considered a priority scheme to be completed by 2017–18, as it ran past the then recently opened Bangkok Government Complex. A review was undertaken in early 2012 to reconsider the heavy rail option, but cost restraints prevailed and the Office decided to continue with the monorail plan. The review of the line did result, however, in the addition of 6 new stations. The environmental impact assessment for the Pink Line was finalized in late 2012. In October 2012, members of the new government requested to extend the planned line east by 3.4 km beyond the Min Buri terminus to Nong Chok. However, this extension of the line was not approved. The expected cost of the line in 2012 with the additional 6 extra stations was 55 billion baht.
The MRT Pink line was due to be tendered in the third quarter of 2013 with construction due to commence in early 2014. However, delays in preparation of the tender in relation to the selection of monorail rolling stock and political protests resulting in a snap national election in early Feb 2014 further delayed the Pink Line tender. A coup in May 2014 resulted in a new military administration and the tender being deferred while a review of all mass transit projects was undertaken for a period of 18 months. The MRT Pink line tender was then changed to a PPP tender process which was not released until mid 2016.
The BSR consortium consisting of BTS Group Holdings (75% majority stake) with Sino-Thai Engineering and Construction STEC, and Ratch Group (RATCH) won the bid in early December 2016 to construct and operate the MRT Pink Line. The BSR consortium won the bid for a 30-year concession operate the line and also won the bid to build and operate the MRT Yellow Line.
On 16 June 2017, contracts were signed by the BSR consortium with the Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand. The BSR established the Northern Bangkok Monorail Company Limited (NBM) to operate the line.
Construction Progress
Construction of the MRT Pink Line began in December 2017 with the BSR consortium establishing a number of preparation work sites and closing lanes along the east-west Chaeng Wattana-Ram Inthra corridor. By 30 September 2018, overall construction was 10.37% complete. Construction work on Tiwanon Road began at the end of October 2018 with the temporary closure of long stretches of the middle lanes between Khae Rai and Pak Kret intersections. Construction had progressed to 31.46% complete by the end of March 2019. By the end of July 2019, completion of civil constructions had further progressed to 40.13%. Overall construction was 48.15% complete at the end of November 2019. By the end of January 2020, construction had progressed to 51.96%. By the end of May 2020, construction had progressed to 58.78%. At the end of July 2020, construction had progressed to 61.83%. At the end of September 2020, construction was 66.31% complete. Construction was 70.32% complete by the end of December 2020. Construction progress was 74.14% complete by the end of February 2021. Construction progress was 77.57% complete by the end of April 2021. Construction progress was 83.40% by the end of October 2021. Construction progress was 84.45% by the end of November 2021.
The terminus station at Nonthaburi Civic Center (PK01) has been moved 337m closer to the Esplanade at Khae Rai junction due to objections from civil servants working at the Nonthaburi provincial office who were concerned that their view of the outside would be obstructed. A new EIA was completed for the relocation but the new station location required Cabinet approval, causing delays to the opening of this section of the line. Nopparat station (PK26) has also been moved away from Nopparat Rajathanee hospital due to the construction of a new Department of Highways bridge. The Cabinet agreed to the amended EIA for the relocation of both stations on 20 October 2020. On 24 September, the MRTA Board granted a 290-day extension to the construction contract schedule due to station design changes at Noppharat Ratchathani station (PK26) due to a new overpass plan, the relocation of Nonthaburi Civic Center station (PK01) and a flood mitigation project by the Highway Department impacting on the construction timeline of Laksi District (PK13), Chaeng Watthana Government Complex (PK 12) and Chaeng Watthana 14 stations (PK 11).
On 9 December 2021, daily testing conducted at a maximum speed of 25 km/h began on a short 4 km section of the line from the depot at Miniburi to Bang Chan station. After a period of 3 months, testing will be conducted at higher speeds along a longer section of the line.
By the end of March 2022, construction progress is at 86.51%.
Muang Thong Thani Branch Line
In 2016, the BTSC received a fund for an extension to link Impact, Muang Thong Thani and the Muang Thong Thani condominium buildings from Bangkok Land Public Company Limited. Accordingly, the BSR joint venture proposed a 2.8 km, 2 station spur monorail route to link to Impact, Muang Thong Thani from Si Rat station. The two stations will be located adjacent to the Impact Challenger building near Muang Thong Thani Lake and the Impact Forum. In early August 2018, a second public hearing was conducted by the MRTA into the extension proposal.
The spur line proposal required a new EIA, which was completed in August 2020. The proposal was then presented to the Cabinet for approval to commence construction before the end of 2020. On 22 October 2020, the National Environment Board chaired by the Deputy PM approved the EIA and the MRTA evaluated construction costs of the spur line with BSR, with the final proposal proposed to be presented to Cabinet for approval by the end of November 2020. On 9 February 2021, Cabinet approved the 2.8 km spur line which is expected to cost 3.37 billion baht. Construction of the spur line was due to commence in July 2021. However, due to COVID-19 outbreaks in greater Bangkok construction has been delayed until December 2021.
The MRTA may also consider a further 2 km extension in the future from Muang Thong Thani to Tiwanon road.
Rolling stock
The BSR selected Bombardier Innovia Monorail 300 rolling stock for the MRT Pink Line. The BSR announced that they will purchase 42 four-car sets to operate the line. The total order of 70 sets of trains for the MRT Pink and MRT Yellow lines will cost 50 billion baht. These trains will be manufactured by CRRC Puzhen Bombardier Transportation Systems (joint venture of Bombardier Transportation and CRRC Nanjing Puzhen) in Wuhu, Anhui, China. The first set was shipped on 4 September 2020 and arrived in Thailand on 1 October at Laem Chabang port with a handover ceremony attended by the Thai Prime Minister, the Bangkok Mass Transit System PLC. (BTSC) Chairman, MRTA and the Canadian Ambassador to Thailand. By July 2021, 8 sets had been delivered and were being tested. All sets were due to be delivered by early 2022. However, as of mid April 2022 only 24 sets had been received and were progressively undergoing testing.
The remaining sets are expected to be delivered by July 2022.

Guidebeams
The Bombardier Innovia Monorail 300 operates on a narrow, elevated guide beam. Pre-cast, post-tensioned guide beams are constructed at an off-site location and later installed on the system. The guide beams are 690mm wide. The Innovia Monorail 300 was designed to navigate curves as tight as 46 m and a maximum grade of 6%. Monorail switches will be either beam replacement or multi-position pivot switches. The system will have evacuation walkways down the entire length of the guide beam. These walkways will allow passengers to escape onboard hazards. These walkways will be used by the maintenance crew for repairs and general maintenance to the system.
List of stations
Originally, the line was designed with 24 stations, two of which with a park and ride facility. However, six new stations were added in mid-2012 for a total of 30 stations.

Everybody's Talking About Jamie (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is the soundtrack album to the 2021 film of the same name based on the eponymous stage musical. Dan Gillespie Sells and Tom MacRae whom wrote the music, book and lyrics for the musical, had written, composed and produced the album. The soundtrack album was released by Island Records and New Regency Music on 10 September 2021, the same day as its U.S. release. Though mostly excludes five of the musical numbers from the stage play, the album features an additional song "This Was Me", performed by Richard E. Grant and Holly Johnson. The soundtrack includes contributions from Becky Hill, Todrick Hall, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Chaka Khan and The Feeling, alongside the film's musical numbers. The album was well received by critics and audiences.
Development
According to Sells, "each character had its own sound" and he wanted to "explore what each character's version of their pop star was". He further opined that "The whole piece is written in the pop vernacular for two reasons. We wrote it for a working-class audience, the ordinary folk who listened to ordinary music that you hear on the radio." Sells added pop music is "incredibly sophisticated and it draws you in and there are no barriers for that". Tom MacRae, on the lyric writing process, had stated in an interview to Script, inscribing:"Dan would write a tune. It'd be [hums a melody] and he'd record that. And I'd have all the gaps and then I record on my phone, and then I go away and listen to it until I'd learn the tune. And then I would just fill in the words and sing it out loud or sing in the shower, sing around the house. Because when you say it out loud, you realize that that sound just trips a little, that combination of constants is a bit too "bap-bap-bap" you just enter the vowel there. And that long note, you need an “ooh” sound for longer or we can't have a constant there and just make it really simple. And just finessing, finessing, finessing. Is there any way I can tell this idea and fewer syllables, that's where you're kind of driven."The new song "This Was Me" (not included in the musical) explores on Jamie's mentor, Hugo and his backstory. Sells added that "It was the story about a mentor explaining to a young queer kid what it was to be queer in London in the ‘80s and early ‘90s with HIV and the AIDS epidemic. It was a song about the section 28 rules, the marches, the demonstrations where drag queens were always a part of. It was about the raids on queer venues by the police. We wanted to show that it was an embattled culture that was part of Hugo's history." Frankie Goes to Hollywood frontman Holly Johnson, recorded this track at the AIR Studios in London. At that point, he was unaware that the song would be a duet featuring Richard E. Grant, and he sang the whole track. When the final version was played, with Grant on the track, he thought that "it really adds something to the song. The texture of Grant's voice and the theatricality of it adds another dimension to it." Grant said that "The whole story of this man's love life is told in the space of a three-minute song. He's at an age when he's got more past than future ahead of him. To physically be back in these very private moments, it's wonderful for him at times but by the end, it's absolutely unbearable that he can't even look at it and has to look away." The track "He's My Boy" is a phrase featured in the documentary, said by Jamie's mother Martha. He added "the track speaks of motherhood in such a simple way we felt was necessary for her to have a voice".
Musical numbers from the stage play, which were excluded from the film and its soundtrack, include "The Legend of Coco Chanelle (and the Blood Red Dress)", "If I Met Myself Again", "Limited Edition Prom Night Special", "Ugly in This Ugly World", "Prom Song" and all reprises save for "It Means Beautiful".

Laurent Jean François Truguet (10 January 1752, Toulon – 26 December 1839, Toulon) was a French admiral.
Life
Youth up to the Revolution
Of aristocratic origins, and the son of a chef d'escadre, Laurent de Truguet entered the gardes de la marine in 1765. He navigated successively the Hirondelle, Provence, Atalante, Pléiade and Chimère. He won several prizes, awarded to the best gardes by Louis XV. He became enseigne de vaisseau in 1773 and had already been in eight campaigns by July 1778, when war was declared against England.
In the war in America, he served on the frigate Atalante then on the vessel Hector under the comte d'Estaing, and took part in the battle at Saint Lucia. Lieutenant de vaisseau from 1779, in the land attack on Savannah, he saved the life of admiral d'Estaing despite being severely wounded himself, for which he was made a knight of Order of Saint Louis.
On the Languedoc then the Citoyen, he took part in various battles as a member of Guichen's then de Grasse's fleet (battle of Chesapeake, Battle of St. Kitts, Battle of the Saintes).
Major de Vaisseau from 1784, he cooperated in the tasks assigned to M. Choiseuil-Gouffier, ambassador to Constantinople, and was charged with instructing the Ottomans in the arts of fortification, artillery, metallurgy, naval architecture, and so on. Truguet commanded a brig, the Tarleton, with which he re-mapped the hydrography of the Dardanelles in 1785 and 1786, and in 1787 published a "Traité de Marine" (Naval Treatise) at Constantinople.
French Revolutionary Wars
On his return to France in 1789, he was sent to Brest in 1790 to take the command of a frigate there intended for a mission that was, in the end, rendered unnecessary by the course of events. He then made a trip in England for there to complete his naval education. Made capitaine de vaisseau on 1 January 1792, he was promoted as early as the following July to the rank of rear admiral, commanding the French naval forces in the Mediterranean from his flagship . He bombarded Nice, Villefranche and Oneglia, while general Montesquiou seized the Duchy of Savoy. That same year he and his fleet were instructed to cooperate in the Expédition de Sardaigne, a failed invasion of the island of Sardinia; he had moved to bombard Cagliari, when an insurrection broke out among the disembarking troops which obliged him to sail to the beaches and reembark them.
Passing Corsica, he was received by the Bonaparte family and began a romance with Elisa, sister of the future Emperor and the close relations with the family which he would retain to his death. On his return to Toulon in March 1793, he went to Paris, where he got the government to adopt a maritime penal code, that would prevent many future insurrections and mutinies but still provoke much discontent in France's naval bases. He was discharged at the end of 31 May that year and imprisoned at the time of the publication of the law of suspects, but was liberated on 9 Thermidor (27 July).
He was promoted vice admiral in 1795 and minister of the Navy by the French Directory from November 1795 to July 1797. During his two years in this ministry, he reestablished discipline and order in France's harbours and arsenals, recalling former officers discharged due to the Revolution. Under pressure from general Hoche, he presented a plan for the 1796 French invasion of Ireland to the Directory, with Morard de Galle commanding the naval forces. This operation proved to be a complete fiasco. He organized and sent a division of frigates into the Indian Ocean under the command of Sercey.
He strove to get the colonies to respect the 1794 decree of the abolition of the slavery, and supported the creation of a collège intended for black and mixed-race children close to Paris; this collège later had the sons of Toussaint Louverture among its pupils, but was closed by Decrès in 1802.
Truguet also took the initiative in composing a new collection of naval tactics that would be adopted in year V of the French Republican Calendar. He broke with the exclusively defensive conceptions of the collection of 1769. He officialised and systematised the practice of having a light attack squadron within each fleet. This collection was later completed by the collection of year IX, also inspired by Truguet.
At the time of the ministerial reshuffle in preparation for the coup of 18 Fructidor year V (4 September 1797), he was replaced by Georges-René Pléville De Pelley, but was instead made France's ambassador to Spain. He was removed from the political scene under the pretext of not having returned to France fast enough at the end of his duties, though in fact this removal was down to Talleyrand, the minister of the foreign affairs, in revenge for Truguet opposing Talleyrand's embezzlements in Spain. Exiled to Holland, he remained there nine months. On his return from Egypt, Napoléon Bonaparte offered him the navy ministry again, but Truguet refused this, and was instead named conseiller d'État on 20 September 1801.
He composed four reports for the First Consul, proposing a reorganization of the navy and taking a strong position and courageous stand against the re-legalisation of slavery – Truguet's solid republican convictions made him consider equality as a fundamental right. He was probably the only official to dare oppose Bonaparte on this point, and was violently attacked and mocked by those favoring a return to the old order in the colonies and strongly reprimanded by the First Consul. Nevertheless, in 1802 he was given command of the combined force gathered at Cadiz, with the eminent title of amiral en chef. The squadrons of Linois, Gantheaume and Bedout had to gather at Truguet's HQ. The peace of Amiens brought the admiral back to Paris.
First French Empire
When war broke out again, Bonaparte entrusted to Truguet the organisation and command of the fleet at Brest, with his flagship being the Alexandre, then the Vengeur. In 1804, while all were conscientiously signing a "spontaneous" petition amidst his whole fleet to demand an imperial crown for Bonaparte, in the same way as was being done in the army, Truguet publicly took a stand against the establishment of the Empire in a letter that became historic. This consigned him to 5 years of severe disgrace, and the loss of all his titles and his membership of the légion d'honneur.
In 1809, the Emperor recalled him to command the squadron gathered at Rochefort, after the disastrous attack by English fireships in the raid on the île d'Aix. The following year, Napoleon put him at the head of the Kingdom of Holland's naval high command. Repulsed by foreign invasion, Truguet was one of the first to leave his post in the last years of the Empire.
Bourbon Restoration
Admiral Truguet returned to Paris where Louis XVIII brought him back into the navy at the head of the naval corps, and made him a knight grand-cross of the Légion d'honneur. During the Hundred Days, he received neither a command nor any favours from Napoleon. On the second restoration, he was given overall command of the Brest fleet, and received orders to keep the town's arsenal safe from the approaching foreign occupation troops. Succeeding in doing so, he was rewarded by the King by being made knight grand-cross of the order of Saint Louis, a comte, and a peer of France (5 May 1819).
At the end of the July Revolution, Truguet was elevated to the highest naval honour, that of Grand Amiral, naval equivalent to Marshal of France. He died aged 87 in 1839 in Toulon.
Analysis
Certainly one of the most competent French sailors of his generation, Truguet was a convinced republican despite his aristocratic origins. He was an effective minister and reestablished a little order in the navy after the excesses of the Terror. On the other hand, he bears some of the responsibility for the fiasco of the expedition to Ireland. Few men like him with important responsibilities dared to oppose Napoleon's re-legalisation of slavery in the colonies or establishment of the Empire, and though his courageous stands made his relations with Napoleon complex and often stormy, Napoleon still considered him one of his better admirals and in difficult circumstances called upon him for confidential missions. He appears on the Arc de Triomphe.

The Wizdish ROVR is an omnidirectional treadmill that simulates walking and running in virtual reality when used alongside a head-mounted display.
It is developed by Wizdish Ltd, who market it as "The mouse of the VR world". This is due to the ROVR providing omnidirectional movement in virtual reality in a manner akin to walking in the real world. This is as opposed to the current teleportation solution. The difference can be described as navigating a website with a mouse instead of cycling through links sequentially using the tab key.
Product overview
The ROVR consists of a round, concave, low friction platform and a plastic or metal frame for user support. The user slides their feet back and forward on the platform, in a reciprocating motion, to simulate locomotion whilst wearing shoe covers that are designed to reduce friction. The soles of the shoe covers are coated in ceramic discs that reduce friction between the user's feet and the ROVR. Wizdish also sells shoes with ceramic discs already fitted. A contact microphone in the ROVR's platform translates the sound of the user's feet moving into forward movement within virtual reality. A low level of noise, made by slow or small movements on the platform, becomes slow movement in virtual reality, whilst louder noises increase the speed of movement. The user moves in whichever direction the head or hand controllers are facing, as the acoustic sensor system can not detect the movement direction of the feet or the orientation of the body. The concave platform combined with reciprocating movement of the feet minimises vertical movement of a person's centre of mass and so mimics the best low energy movement of real walking. It also encourages the user's feet to slip back into the centre of the ROVR, stopping the user from moving off the platform. A ring encircles the user at waist height, forming a containment field. This is for user support during orientation and to provide a boundary to stop the user from moving off the platform. Users quickly become used to the platform's surface, and are able to balance without the help of the ring, their hands being free to use independent controllers such as Oculus Touch, Vive wands, Knuckles and the Xbox One Controller.
The ROVR works with multiple different head mounted displays as it interfaces with software directly and not through the headset.
Virtual reality sickness solution
By enabling naturally intuitive full physicality of movement in virtual reality the ROVR seeks to solve the problem of virtual reality sickness. Virtual reality sickness is a type of motion sickness that occurs when movement is seen but not felt when immersed in virtual reality thereby disrupting visual-vestibular matching and proprioception of the body. It is reported that two thirds of virtual reality users experience virtual reality sickness. The ROVR aims to satisfy the body's need to feel the movement it is experiencing visually by having the user perform a variation of walking in place. Studies indicate that walking in place increases the sense of presence when using virtual reality as the proprioceptive information in the body resembles the visual stimulus being provided by the head-mounted display. People do not carry memories of how they move their legs when they walk because locomotion is largely autonomous, being controlled by a Central pattern generator. The ROVR, therefore, doesn't rely on the exact recreation of how the legs move during ambulation, rather, it aims to provide enough activity in the legs that approximates the sensation of ambulation to 'trick' the users mind into thinking they are walking normally.
History
Wizdish Ltd was founded in 2009 by Julian Williams. Williams, an engineer for the BBC, had been experimenting with the idea of a 'VR treadmill' since 2001 and had applied for a US patent in 2003 which was granted in 2008. Williams was put in contact with Charles King, who holds a PhD in Physical metallurgy and the Science of Materials. King had links with several UK universities including University College London, King's College London, and Oxford Brookes University, the latter through a partnership that began when he was a consultant for Siemens. Together they developed and patented the low friction material used in the ROVR's platform base.
ROVR1
King and Williams built a prototype version of the ROVR and began selling it in 2012 on the Wizdish website under the name ROVR1. The ROVR1's containment frame consists of a waist high polymer ring supported by five polymer legs that adjoin a larger ring at the base of the ROVR1. This larger ring encircles the ROVR's patented, concave, low friction surface platform. Between its release in 2012 and 2016 the ROVR1, weighing in at 15kgs, had been actively tested by over 30,000 people.
Sales of the ROVR1, along with funding from Liberty Global and Techstars, helped fund the development of the ROVR2.
ROVR2
Wizdish launched their ROVR2 at the VR World Congress 2017. The ROVR2 is a slightly heavier, more aesthetic version of Wizdish's initial prototype. It weighs 25kg. The containment frame consists of a waist high, stainless steel metal ring supported by two legs that connect to the ROVR2's base. The low friction platform of the ROVR2 also has higher sides than the ROVR1. It is also collapsible, making it portable.
Applications
The ROVR's most popular application is for gaming in virtual reality. Omnidirectional treadmills increase immersion inside virtual worlds by allowing the gamer to be mobile. The gamer's feeling of 'being there' is increased by this freedom of movement as they are able to identify more closely with their in-game avatar. This is as opposed to sitting still whilst their in-game avatar moves around.
There is also potential for the ROVR in the arcade gaming market. The act of sliding the feet to navigate virtual spaces provides a novel gaming experience in a similar vein to arcade dance pads.
The ROVR requires the user to be on their feet and mobile and therefore can be used as fitness equipment in a manner similar to a regular treadmill and the Wii Balance Board. It also has the potential to aid with injury recovery by providing a low stress environment to exercise injured muscles.
The ROVR has been used by Dominator Yachts to show customers around virtual versions of the yachts they sell.
In 2014 Nissan used the ROVR to market their Juke at the Paris Motor Show. The user assumed the role of an 'iron man' figure running through a virtual city, keeping pace with a Juke driving alongside.
In 2015 Wells Fargo started on a 3 year campaign using ROVRs at public events in the USA to promote the Wells Fargo brand. Mosaic, an event marketing think tank, found that after attending a Wells Fargo event 74% of the participants said they have a more positive opinion about the company, brand, product, or service being promoted. The study also found 96% of consumers who tell a friend or family member about their experience mention the company or brand running the event.
With the advent of 5G the viability for wireless head-mounted displays and peripherals is increasing. Wizdish is developing a bluetooth version of the ROVR which aims to provide a wireless virtual reality experience when used in tandem with a wireless head-mounted display.

The Panama women's national football team is overseen by the Federación Panameña de Fútbol. After a 12 year absence, the team will return to the CONCACAF Women's Championship in 2018 after finishing second in UNCAF zone qualifying.
History
2000s
In 2002 Panama qualified for the CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup for the first time after securing one of two spots in Central American Zone qualifying. They went 1–0–2 at the 2002 CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup and did not qualify for the knockout round.
Panama once again qualified for the Women's Gold Cup in 2006 after winning their qualifying group. Panama lost their first round match 2–1 to Jamaica and were eliminated.
2010s
Panama did not participate in the 2010 CONCACAF Women's World Cup Qualifying tournament as they did not enter Central American qualifying.
In 2013 Panama participated in the Central American Games for the first time. They went 1–0–1 and advanced to the semi-finals, where they lost to Costa Rica. Panama would finish in fourth place after losing the third place match to Guatemala.
Panama finished second in their group in 2014 Central American Qualifying and did not qualify for the 2014 CONCACAF Women's Championship as only the group winner advanced.
At the 2017 Central American Games, Panama improved on their result from four ago by defeating El Salvador on penalties to finish in third place.
Panama secured one of the two spots available in Central American Qualifying for the 2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship, this marked their first time playing in the CONCACAF Championship in 12 years. Panama was drawn into Group A, alongside the United States, Mexico and Trinidad and Tobago.
Panama opened the 2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship with a 3–0 victory over Trinidad and Tobago. They suffered a 5–0 loss to the United States in their second match. The score could have been much worse if not for the excellent performance from 17-year old goalkeeper Yenith Bailey, as she made several big saves against the US who had 18 shots on goal. Panama secured their spot in the semi-final by defeating Mexico 2–0 in their final group match. Bailey once again made some big saves, including saving a penalty in the first half. Panama was beat by Canada 7–0 in the semi-final, but they would move on to the third place match where a win would secure them a spot in the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. After losing the third place match to Jamaica on penalties, Panama played against Argentina at the CONCACAF-CONMEBOL play-off to secure a spot for France 2019 but was eliminated from the qualification after losing 1–5 to the Argentines on aggregate.
2020s
Panama qualified for the 2022 CONCACAF W Championship and took part in the group stage, against its arch-rival and neighbour Costa Rica, alongside regional powerhouse Canada and Trinidad and Tobago. Panama suffered two defeats to Costa Rica and Canada, thus lost the chance to finish in top two, but by winning 1–0 over Trinidad and Tobago in the decisive third place match, Panama was able to qualify for the inter-confederation play-offs for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, where the quest for its potential World Cup debut continues.

The Universal Powerline Association (UPA) was a trade association that covered power line communication (PLC) markets and applications. The UPA promoted and certified power line communication technology from 2004 to 2010.
History
An interest group for the UPA was established by the founding members in May 2004. A memorandum of understanding was signed by the founding members in September 2004, and the UPA was officially announced in January 2005. It was a non-profit trade group registered in Belgium.
Design of Systems on Silicon (DS2), a supplier of integrated circuits and software for PLC, was among the founding members; UPA systems were based on its technology.
Other members included: AcBel, Ambient Corporation, bpl, Corinex Communications, IBEC, Netgear, PCN Technology, Toshiba, Toyo Network Systems, and Junaid.
The Universal Powerline Association released specifications related to three aspects of powerline technology.
The UPA coexistence specification was published in June 2005.
The UPA Access specification (the European OPERA project endorsed specification for Internet access over power lines) was published in February 2006.
In-home systems and solutions, called "triple play" scenarios, were published in February 2006 as the UPA Digital Home Specification v1.0.
The UPA worked with international standardisation bodies such as IEEE and ETSI.
Certification events (known as Plugtests) were held in January 2006 and 2007, with products demonstrated at the Consumer Electronics Show.
DS2 had financial problems in 2010.
Marvell Technology Group acquired the intellectual property of DS2 in August 2011, although it continued to provide UPA specifications compliant devices. With the exit of DS2 from the market, the UPA suspended activities in November 2010 and discontinued its website, although the UPA market continued through Marvell and its partners.

Kiss the Girls is a 1997 American neo-noir psychological thriller film directed by Gary Fleder and starring Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, and Cary Elwes. The screenplay by David Klass is based on James Patterson's best-selling 1995 novel of the same name. A sequel titled Along Came a Spider was released in 2001.
Plot
Washington, D.C. detective and forensic psychologist Alex Cross heads to Durham, North Carolina when his niece Naomi, a college student, is reported missing. He learns from police detective Nick Ruskin that Naomi is the latest in a series of young women who have vanished. Soon after his arrival, one of the missing women is found dead, bound to a tree, and a short time later, Kate McTiernan is kidnapped from her home.
When she awakens from a drugged state, Kate discovers that she is being held by a masked man calling himself Casanova, and she is one of several prisoners trapped in his lair. She manages to escape and is severely injured when she jumps from a cliff into a river. After she recuperates, she joins forces with Cross to track down her captor, whom Cross concludes is a collector, not a killer, unless his victims fail to follow his rules. This means there is time to rescue the other imprisoned women, as long as they remain obedient.
Clues lead them to Los Angeles, where a series of gruesome kidnappings and murders have been credited to Dr. William Rudolph, known as the Gentleman Caller. Cross's efforts to capture and question Rudolph are foiled when Rudolph escapes. In North Carolina, Cross traces Casanova up the river. Alerted by a gunshot, he discovers Casanova's underground hideout. Rudolph is revealed to be Casanova's partner. Casanova escapes, while Rudolph is shot by Cross. Cross rescues the kidnapped women, including Naomi.
Later, Kate invites Cross to dinner at her house. Ruskin drops by Kate's house and sends home the two officers guarding her. While Cross is at home preparing to meet Kate for dinner, he discovers that Ruskin's signature on the arrest warrants matches Casanova's handwriting. Cross tries calling Kate to inform her, but Ruskin has already disconnected her phone line. Kate becomes suspicious of Ruskin while conversing with him. He then drops his accent, revealing he is Casanova. After a fight and attempted rape, Kate manages to handcuff him to the oven. Ruskin slashes Kate's arm with a kitchen knife. In attempting to free himself, Ruskin pulls the oven away from the wall, rupturing the gas pipe. Ruskin takes out a lighter, threatening to cause an explosion due to the leaking gas. Cross shows up and tries to discourage Ruskin. When this fails, Cross shoots Ruskin, firing through a milk carton to avoid igniting the gas. Cross comforts Kate as the police arrive.

Production
Filming
Principal photography began on April 16, 1996. The film shot two weeks on location in North Carolina on the streets of Durham, in nearby county parks, and outside a Chapel Hill, North Carolina residence. The police station was constructed in a downtown Durham warehouse. The majority of filming occurred in the Los Angeles area, with locations including the Disney Ranch, The Athenaeum at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, a house in the Adams historic district of Los Angeles, and on the campus of the University of Southern California in University Park. Designed by American production designer Nelson Coates, the majority of the sets, including the tunnels and underground chambers, were constructed in sound stages on the Paramount Studios lot. Filming was completed on July 10, 1996.
Release
The film premiered at the Deauville Film Festival in September 1997 before opening on 2,271 screens in the US the following month. It earned $13,215,167 in its opening weekend and a total of $60,527,873 in the US, ranking #30 in domestic revenue for the year.
The film was not shown in some theaters in central Virginia at the time of release, due to the unsolved murders of three teenage girls in the area. This decision was out of respect for the families and surrounding communities. The murders were eventually solved and attributed to Richard Evonitz.
Reception
Critical reception
The film received negative reviews and has a "Rotten" rating of 33% on Rotten Tomatoes from 33 reviews with the consensus: "Detective Alex Cross makes his inauspicious cinematic debut in Kiss the Girls, a clunky thriller that offers few surprises."
Stephen Holden of The New York Times said the film "is cut from the same cloth as The Silence of the Lambs, but the piece of material it uses has the uneven shape and dangling threads of a discarded remnant.... [It] begins promisingly, then loses its direction as the demand for accelerated action overtakes narrative logic." Holden writes of Morgan Freeman that he "projects a kindness, patience and canny intelligence that cut against the movie's fast pace and pumped-up shock effects. His performance is so measured it makes you want to believe in the movie much more than its gimmicky jerry-rigged [sic] plot ever permits."
In the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of four stars and said, "David Klass, the screenwriter, gives Freeman and Judd more specific dialogue than is usual in thrillers; they sound as if they might actually be talking with each other and not simply advancing plot points.... [They] are so good, you almost wish they'd decided not to make a thriller at all - had simply found a way to construct a drama exploring their personalities."
Rita Kempley of The Washington Post called the film "a tense, scary, perversely creepy thriller" and added, "David Klass ... blessedly deletes the graphic descriptions of torture and rape included in the novel. Unfortunately, he also neglects to include any explanation of Casanova's behavior. Otherwise Kiss the Girls does what it's supposed to do. A solid second film from director Gary Fleder, it's sure to set pulses racing and spines tingling." In the same newspaper, Desson Howe felt "The movie ... operates on the crime-movie equivalent of automatic pilot. It takes off, flies and lands without much creative intervention."
In the San Francisco Chronicle, Peter Stack thought "the story ... goes on too long. It has too many confusing plot twists and keeps losing energy. Blame it on Hollywood excess, or director Gary Fleder's uncertain hand. A cut of 15 minutes would have helped." He was more impressed by the film's stars, calling Morgan Freeman "compelling" and "a hero of extraordinary power that comes almost entirely from his unemotional, calculating calm," and stating that Ashley Judd "gives the sometimes plodding drama a dose of intense vitality. This young actress is getting awfully good at turning potentially gelatinous characters into substantive people who spark viewer interest."
Awards and nominations
Judd was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture Drama at the 1998 Satellite Awards.
Sequel and reboot
Four years after Kiss the Girls, a film adaptation of Along Came a Spider was released. Morgan Freeman reprised his role. Later, the franchise was rebooted with a 2012 adaptation of the novel Cross, titled Alex Cross, starring Tyler Perry in the titular role.

The 2011 Gold Coast Titans season was the 5th in the club's history. They competed in the NRL's 2011 Telstra Premiership coached by John Cartwright and captained by Scott Prince. Gold Coast finished the regular season 16th (out of 16), failing to make the finals and collecting the wooden spoon for the first time in the club's history.
Season Summary
The Gold Coast Titans started the season poorly with three first up losses to the reigning premiers St. George Illawarra Dragons, then a 40–12 smashing at the hands of the Melbourne Storm before losing to archrivals the Brisbane Broncos at home. It seemed after the loss to Melbourne that the Titans would never recover and its fans were forecasting a very long season ahead.
Round 4 saw the Titans register their first win for the 2011 season with a 23–22 golden point win over the Canberra Raiders thanks to a Greg Bird field goal in the 2nd minute of extra time. The winning feeling was short-lived with a 10-point loss to the North Queensland Cowboys the following week. Things improved however with the signing of Bulldogs centre Jamal Idris for 5 years and a win against the Wests Tigers in round 6. Round 7 saw the Titans lose their fifth game of the season with the Parramatta Eels scoring a try with 37 seconds remaining to give them a 22–18 victory. A win over the Sydney Roosters in round 8 saw the Titans improve their win–loss record 3–5, and Nathan Friend become the first player to play 100 games for the Titans. This would be the Titans' last win for a while as they lost their next four games, including three at home.
The Titans emerged briefly from their losing streak to beat a depleted St. George Illawarra Dragons missing six players due to Origin before entering a five-game losing streak which included a 36–12 loss to the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, which is their worst ever defeat at Skilled Park. To help counter their poor form and last place on the ladder, the Titans lured former dual-international Mat Rogers out of retirement to play out the remainder of the 2011 NRL season. The return did little to change the luck of the Titans with Rogers breaking his foot in his very first game back (although he did achieve a milestone in his comeback, with this being his 200th NRL game) and their poor season continuing with a 22–6 loss against the New Zealand Warriors in round 18. It only got worse for the Titans, with 3 more losses from as many games, including a 30-point thrashing from the Newcastle Knights in round 21.
Round 22 saw the Titans rebound with a gutsy 20–16 win over the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks but came at a price, with captain Scott Prince breaking his arm and being ruled out for the remainder of the season. The loss of Prince saw retiring club legend Preston Campbell elevated to captain but faced a tough debut against the ladder leading Melbourne Storm. Melbourne easily handled the Titans beating them by 24 points, the game also saw Preston Campbell play his 100th game for the Titans. Round 24 saw the Titans jump two spaces clear of the bottom of the ladder thanks to a 26–18 victory over the Canberra Raiders in front of their lowest ever home crowd of just 10,230.
The Titans had a chance to secure safety from the wooden spoon with a win in Round 25 against the Tigers but instead were soundly beaten by 19 points. Round 26 saw the 15th-placed Titans play the 16th-placed Parramatta Eels in the so-called "Wooden Spoon Showdown", with the loser taking out the wooden spoon for the 2011 season. Despite home ground advantage and wanting to send retiring Preston Campbell out a winner, the Titans gave the Eels a 22-point lead at halftime. The lead proved too much for the Titans, eventually losing 32–12 and collecting the club's first wooden spoon.

An anaxonic neuron is a type of neuron where there is no axon or it cannot be differentiated from the dendrites. Being loyal to the etymology of anaxonic there are two types of anaxonic neurons in the human nervous system, the undifferentiated anaxonic neuron where the axon cannot be differentiated from the dendrites, and the unipolar brush cell (UBC), that has no axon and only a dendritic arbour.
Location
They are found in the brain and retina, in the latter location it is found as the amacrine cell and retina horizontal cells. They are also found in invertebrates.
Function
They act as non-spiking interneurons.

The Woman in Black is a 1989 British television horror film directed by Herbert Wise and starring Adrian Rawlins, Bernard Hepton, David Daker and Pauline Moran. The teleplay is adapted from the 1983 novel of the same name by Susan Hill. It focuses on a young solicitor who is sent to a coastal English village to settle the estate of a reclusive widow, and finds the town haunted.
The programme was produced by Central Independent Television for the ITV Network, and premiered on Christmas Eve 1989 and was an unexpected success, though author Susan Hill reportedly disagreed with some of the slight changes screenwriter Nigel Kneale made in the adaptation. Another film version was released in 2012, starring Daniel Radcliffe in the lead role.
Plot
In 1925, London solicitor Arthur Kidd travels to the coastal market town of Crythin Gifford on England's east coast to attend the funeral and settle the estate of Alice Drablow, a reclusive widow. Upon his arrival Kidd meets Sam Toovey, a local landowner who is unsettled to hear of the Drablows. Kidd finds the townspeople reluctant to talk about Drablow's home, Eel Marsh House.
Kidd attends the funeral with local solicitor Pepperell. He notices a woman in black in the church, then again amid the gravestones. He mentions the woman to Pepperell. Elsewhere, a truck drops lumber and cripples a Romani child.
Kidd goes to Eel Marsh House over a tidal causeway. Driver Keckwick knows the timing of the tides.
Kidd sees the woman again in the graveyard. Terrified, he flees into the house. While looking around the study, he finds two death certificates as well as pictures of a young woman who resembles the Woman in Black. After hearing some disturbing recordings made by Mrs. Drablow on wax cylinders, he heads back to town.
In town, Toovey tells him not to go back to the house, but Kidd insists on returning. Toovey loans Kidd his dog Spider.
Upon his return, Kidd hears a bouncing ball from upstairs. Spider starts whining and leads Kidd to a door that cannot be opened. Kidd gets an axe to break the door, returning to find the door has opened by itself.
Kidd sees an immaculately clean child's nursery. Kidd notices that a lead soldier is somehow in his hand. He realizes that the generator is running down. Unwilling to be left in the dark, Kidd rushes outside toward the generator.
Outside, Spider answers a high whistle and runs away. The noise of the horse and child start again. Kidd, frightened almost into madness, rushes to lock himself into the house. He records his fears onto the wax cylinders.
From various sources inside the study, Kidd learns that Mrs. Drablow's sister, Jennet Goss, gave birth to a child but was unable to care for it. The Drablows adopted the boy, insisting he should never know that Jennet was his mother. One day, Jennet kidnapped her son and tried to escape via the causeway. The pony and trap became lost and sank into the marshes, killing all aboard.
Toovey arrives at Eel Marsh House, brought by Spider, and listens to Kidd's theories. Toovey says that seeing the Woman in Black presages the death of a child. Kidd packs to leave. However, amongst the papers, he finds the lead soldier. He points this out to Toovey, and they go up to the nursery. However, when they reach it, the room is a mess, with all the toys smashed and the furniture in shambles. Kidd collapses.
Kidd awakens in the town inn to the sound of the child's laughter and finds the soldier yet again in his hand. After asking out loud what the child wants of him, the child replies that the soldier "is for you". The Woman in Black appears, hovering over his bed, and shrieks into his face, terrifying him into unconsciousness.
Kidd returns to London and his family. His boss instructs him to look through the box of papers from Crythin Gifford. At that moment, his two assistants come in and say that there was a customer for him, a woman dressed completely in black. Delirious with terror, Kidd searches madly through the box for the toy soldier. When he does not find it, he burns all the papers and the box, and half his office as well. His boss fires him and the Kidd family leaves London.
Later, Arthur and his family are boating on a peaceful lake when Arthur sees the Woman in Black. Petrified, he does nothing. A tree falls on their boat, drowning and killing them all.
Cast
Production
The programme was filmed at Stanlake Park in Berkshire, using the causeway to Osea Island, near Goldhanger in Essex, and the local salt marshes, whilst scenes to represent Crythin Gifford were filmed at the National Trust village of Lacock, near Chippenham, Wiltshire. The external funeral scene was filmed in Sarratt, Hertfordshire.
Release
Broadcast history
The film was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on ITV on Christmas Eve 1989, with the only repeat airing taking place on Channel 4 at Christmas 1994. Overall the TV adaptation stayed reasonably faithful to the original novel, although some of the changes angered the author Susan Hill (for example, the sex of the dog 'Spider' was changed from female to male). Arthur's name has also been changed from Kipps to Kidd.
Home media
The TV version was released in the United Kingdom on VHS exclusive to WHSmith stores, but only for a fairly short time. There was also a Region 1 DVD release by BFS Entertainment, released on 8 August 2000, but it is now out of print and, according to the messageboard at the site of Susan Hill, the television rights are now owned by someone else. The rights have been purchased twice and currently reside with a U.S. studio.
In the United Kingdom, Network Distributing has re-released the film on both Blu-Ray and DVD. The film for this release has been restored and remastered in high-definition from the original film elements and features extras including a booklet, full screen and widescreen presentations and audio commentary by authors Mark Gatiss, Andy Nyman and Kim Newman.
Critical reception
In his book Creature Features: The Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror Movie Guide (2000), John Stanley wrote that the film was a "chilly British ghost story in the best literary traditions of H. R. Wakefield and M. R. James... [it] has moments that will freeze your bone marrow." Lisa Kerrigan of the British Film Institute noted that the film "makes for a spine-tingling viewing experience." In 2011, Complex named the film the fourteenth-best television film of all time, noting that it "disturbs right down to its unbelievably downbeat ending."
Awards and nominations
The Woman in Black was nominated for four BAFTA awards, including Best Design, Best Film Sound, Best Make Up and Best Original Television Music.

Throwing Muses are an American alternative rock band formed in 1981 in Newport, Rhode Island, United States, that toured and recorded extensively until 1997, when its members began concentrating more on other projects.
The group was originally fronted by two stepsisters, Kristin Hersh and Tanya Donelly, who both wrote the group's songs. Throwing Muses are known for performing music with shifting tempos, creative chord progressions, unorthodox song structures, and surreal lyrics. The group was set apart from other contemporary acts by Hersh's stark, candid writing style; Donelly's pop stylings and vocal harmonies; and David Narcizo's unusual drumming techniques eschewing use of cymbals. Hersh's hallucinatory, feverish lyrics occasionally touch on the subject of mental illness, more often drawing portraits of characters from daily life or addressing relationships.
History
1983–1986: Formation, first EP and The Doghouse Cassette, debut album
Throwing Muses were formed in 1983 by Kristin Hersh and her stepsister Tanya Donelly, who were both attending Rogers High School. They initially called themselves "Kristin Hersh and the Muses", in which band they were accompanied by bass player Elaine Adamedes and drummer Becca Blumen who were later replaced by Leslie Langston and David Narcizo, respectively. Narcizo did not originally know how to play the drums but when Hersh told him that Becca Blumen had left the band and he could join, Narcizo said on the subject "I had never played a drum kit before – all I'd played was marching drums and concert drums. We found somebody whose kit we could borrow, but it arrived without cymbals. I learned to play on it without cymbals which then became my trademark early on."
Throwing Muses released their debut self-titled EP in 1984 on their own Blowing Fuses label. In 1985, they released a set of demos, later known as The Doghouse Cassette, garnering a number-one college radio hit, "Sinkhole" and extensive coverage in the local music press. Demo producer Gary Smith of Fort Apache Studios led them to sign with 4AD, where they became the label's first American band. Kristin recalls, "I signed with them because [owner] Ivo [Watts-Russell] was funny and goofy, and that was about it." In 1986, they released their self-titled debut album produced by Gil Norton. Hersh has written the memoir Rat Girl about the year the band moved to Boston, was signed, and recorded their first album.
1987–1991: further EPs, House Tornado, Hunkpapa and The Real Ramona
In 1987, Throwing Muses released two EPs, Chains Changed and The Fat Skier, released July 6. These were followed in 1988 by their second studio album, House Tornado, produced by Gary Smith and engineered by Paul Kolderie; it was recorded at Fort Apache Studios in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The album was released internationally on the 4AD label, except in the United States, where it was released by Sire Records. Sire used a different album cover for its release, as the label was putting a strong promotional push behind the band, and label executives favored a picture of the band over the collage featured on the 4AD release. Both House Tornado and the Fat Skier were combined on a single CD in a later release. The band embarked on a tour of the UK, supported by the Pixies, to support House Tornado.
In 1989, the band released their third album, Hunkpapa, which was produced by Gary Smith and engineered by Steve Haigler. The album saw Hersh experimenting with more conventional melodic structures, although the fractious lyrics remained. The song “Dizzy” was released as a single.
In 1990, bassist Leslie Langston left and was replaced by Fred Abong. Throwing Muses recorded their fourth album, The Real Ramona during the same year. The Real Ramona is considered to have a more poppy sound than their previous records. The song "Counting Backwards" from the album was released as a single. Shortly after the album's release in 1991, Tanya Donelly left the Muses to form Belly, taking Abong with her.
1992–2002: Work as trio – Red Heaven, University, Limbo and disbandment
With Donnelly not being replaced, Throwing Muses opted to continue as a trio, with Bernard Georges replacing Abong on bass. In 1992, the band made a fresh start recording their fifth album Red Heaven at The Power Station and Fort Apache Studios. The album was produced by Throwing Muses and Steve Boyer, and also featured guest appearances by Leslie Langston and by Hüsker Dü frontman Bob Mould (the latter duetting with Hersh on the song "Dio").
In 1993, they recorded their sixth album, University. Hersh recorded her debut album, Hips and Makers, immediately after recording finished on University. Hips and Makers was released first, in 1994, which delayed the release of University until 1995. University gave the band their first national U.S. hit, "Bright Yellow Gun". The album was favorably reviewed.
Throwing Muses released their seventh album, Limbo, which was followed by a tour. However, the band disbanded in 1997 as Kristin Hersh went on to continue her solo career.
2002–present: Reformation – Throwing Muses, Purgatory, etc.
In March 2003, Throwing Muses came back with their eighth album, Throwing Muses, which also saw the return of Tanya Donelly who provided backing vocals on the album. The greatest hits compilation titled Anthology was released in 2011. The band's ninth album, Purgatory / Paradise was released on October 29, 2013 in the UK and November 11 in the US.
In early 2014, the band toured a few U.S. cities, with Donelly opening for the East Coast dates.
The first single from their new album Sun Racket, titled "Dark Blue", was released in February 2020. The album was released on Fire Records on September 4, 2020.

Józef Mackiewicz (April 1, 1902 – January 31, 1985) was a Polish writer, novelist and political commentator; best known for his documentary novels Nie trzeba głośno mówić (One Is Not Supposed to Speak Aloud), and Droga donikąd (The Road to Nowhere). He staunchly opposed communism, referring to himself as an "anticommunist by nationality". Mackiewicz died in exile. His older brother Stanisław Mackiewicz was also a writer.
Life and career
Józef Mackiewicz was the son of Antoni Mackiewicz and Maria née Pietraszkiewicz originally from Kraków, a Polish noble family from the Polish-Lithuanian gentry of Bożawola coat of arms. He was born on 1 April 1902 in Saint Petersburg. Józef Mackiewicz was the younger brother of Stanisław Mackiewicz, a political publicist and Prime Minister of the postwar Polish government in exile from 1954 to 1955; and Seweryna Mackiewicz, mother of Polish writer .
In 1907 his family moved to Vilnius. In 1919, as a 17-year-old volunteer he participated in the Polish–Soviet War, first, as an uhlan of the Polish Army's 10th Lithuanian Uhlan Regiment, and then of the 13th Wilno Uhlan Regiment. He finished his military service during Poland's fight of independence as an uhlan of the . Similar to other young veterans of the war who entered university without their Matura graduation, Mackiewicz started his favourite subject of biological sciences at the University of Warsaw and then upon moving to Vilnius continued studies at the Vilnius University, but he never graduated with a degree. From 1923 he worked as a journalist for Słowo (The Word), a periodical published in Vilnius by his older brother Stanisław and fully sponsored and financed by the old noble families of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Journalist work took him all over the Baltic republics and eastern Poland.
Mackiewicz married Antonina Kopańska with whom he had a daughter Halina, and upon divorce he was in a long-term relationship with Wanda Żyłowska, with whom he had a daughter Idalia. Then he began his lifelong relationship with a writer and journalist of Vilnius' Słowo Barbara Toporska, but they had no children. They married in 1939.
World War II
On September 17, 1939 Soviet troops attacked eastern Poland as part of the joint German-Soviet Invasion of Poland. Upon the division of the country by occupying forces, the Vilnius region was transferred to then independent Lithuania. Mackiewicz remained in the city and between October 1939 and May 1940 was a publisher and editor-in-chief of the Gazeta Codzienna (Daily Paper), a Polish-language daily in Lithuanian-controlled Vilnius. In his articles, he attempted to initiate a political dialogue between Lithuanians and Poles. In May 1940, he was forbidden from further role as publisher and journalist by the Lithuanian government.
After the June 15, 1940 invasion and annexation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union, Mackiewicz worked temporarily as a labourer. In 1942, he witnessed the Ponary massacre of some 100,000 mostly Polish Jews by German SD, SS and the Lithuanian Nazi collaborators Ypatingasis būrys, which he described in his 1969 book Nie trzeba głośno mówić (One Is Not Supposed to Speak Aloud). At the end of 1942 (beginning of 1943) he was mistakenly sentenced to death by the resistance, for his work at Gazeta Codzienna and Goniec Codzienny. The sentence was cancelled out (see below).
Discovery of Katyń Forest Massacre
In April 1943 Mackiewicz was invited by the international Katyn Commission, headed by German occupying authorities, to the site of Katyn massacre. Upon consent of the Polish government-in-exile, he assisted in the first excavations of the mass graves of the Polish officers killed by Soviet NKVD there in 1940. Upon his return to Vilnus, the local German-sponsored daily Goniec Codzienny published an interview with Mackiewicz titled "Widziałem na własne oczy" ("I saw with my own eyes"). He later arrived in Italy where he worked for the II Corps (Poland) and, in this capacity, he edited a compilation of documents related directly to the Katyń Massacre under the title Zbrodnia katyńska w świetle dokumentów (The Katyn murder in light of new evidence), published in 1948 with an introduction by General Władysław Anders. At the same time he wrote his own book under the title Katyń. Zbrodnia bez sądu i kary (Katyn. Murder without Trial nor Sentence). Its first Polish language publication was destroyed by the publisher in London, UK, for political reasons. In 1949 he published its German language version, Katyn – ungesühntes Verbrechen, in Zurich, Switzerland. In 1951 he published the English-version of his book under a title The Katyn Wood Murders, the very first book in English on the subject (Italian version in 1954 as Il Massacro della foresta di Katyn, in Spanish in 1957 as Las Fosas de Katyn, in Russian published in Canada in 1988 as Катынь). In 1952 he testified before US Senate Committee known as "Select Committee to Investigate and Study the Facts, Evidence, and Circumstances of the Katyn Forest Massacre" about the genocidal nature the Katyń Massacre (the Polish version of Katyń. Zbrodnia bez sądu i kary was published in 1997 in Poland, and again under different title: Sprawa mordu katyńskiego. Ta książka była pierwsza in 2009).
Obtaining death penalty for false accusations of collaboration
During the German occupation of Vilnius in 1941, Mackiewicz was falsely accused of "collaboration" with the Germans.
Mackiewicz believed that a return to the prewar borders of Poland was a pipe-dream and not a useful premise, which some local Poles then considered unthinkable. However, Mackiewicz was proven correct by later events.
He proclaimed that opposing just one invader, Germany (as did the Polish Resistance), was synonymous with helping the second invader, the Soviet Union, because their intentions were identical. He believed that opposing communism was more important.
His ridicule of the Polish false hopes was too much for some of his adversaries. He was sentenced to death by an underground tribunal, but to Czesław Miłosz, he was not a collaborator. In 1947, Mackiewicz was completely cleared of any wrongdoing. It is open to debate, according to Miłosz, how much the popular criticism of his novels was influenced by the Soviet sympathies of his adversaries.
The accusations negatively influenced the Polish perceptions of Mackiewicz's work, especially following World War II, and were exploited by his critics. The accusations, however, were not the cornerstone of the second sentence by passed the communists on him and his works, as it was his role in the revelation to the world of the Katyń Massacre and unrelenting work to expose the evils of the communist system that caused his absence from Polish literature.
Therefore, from 1945 to 1990, the duration of the Communist régime, he was blacklisted, no official publications were permitted, and no academic work or journalistic discussion about his works was allowed and so several generations of Poles grew up without knowing his works or about him.
Exile
Mackiewicz and his wife Barbara Toporska left Vilnius and lived in Warsaw until July 31, 1944, when they left for Kraków and then finally left Poland for Rome in January 1945, never to return. They first lived in Italy and he started publishing in various émigré publications like "Kultura" in Paris and many others. In 1948 they moved to London and he continued writing and publishing. In 1955 he and his wife Barbara Toporska moved permanently to Munich, where he died in January 1985. He continued to write on variety of topics and also published plenty of fiction and articles, living a rather impoverished life supported by royalties from publishers.
Works
Mackiewicz's prose is extremely realistic: he believed that there are no untouchable subjects in writing. In 1957, he published Kontra, a narrative account of the particularly brutal and treacherous handover of thousands of anti-Soviet Cossacks back to the Soviets by the British soldiers in Austria; and in 1962 Sprawa pulkownika Miasojedowa ("Colonel Miasoyedov's Case"), a harshly realistic novel of the bombing of Dresden in World War II. His other best-known novels include: Droga donikąd ("The Road to Nowhere"), an account of life under Soviet occupation; Zwycięstwo prowokacji ("Victory of Provocation") on communism; and W cieniu krzyża ("In the Shadow of the Cross") on Catholicism. His voluminous output as a writer of fiction and a publicist has been undergoing a revival after many years of underground publishing and later marginal interest. His books have been published since 1972 by the KONTRA Publishing House of London, UK, owned by Nina Karsov-Szechter. In 2009 Nina Karsov-Szechter received an award of the Union of Polish Writers Abroad as the editor of works by Józef Mackiewicz.
Popular culture
Józef Mackiewicz is the subject of two documentaries made after his death. First was the film „Jedynie prawda jest ciekawa” (Only the truth is interesting) by Robert Kaczmarek made for Polish TV in 1996, and then in 2008 a short film „Errata do biografii – Józef Mackiewicz” (Correction to biography - Józef Mackiewicz) by Grzegorz Braun. His life and works are the subject of more that 30 scholarly works, as well as articles, websites and blogs.

Hagop Oshagan (; December 9, 1883 in Soloz, Bursa – February 17, 1948 in Aleppo), was an Armenian writer, playwright, and novelist. Among his many novels are the trilogy To One Hundred and One Years (Հարիւր մէկ տարուան), The Harlot (Ծակ պտուկը), and his best-known work, Remnants (Մնացորդաց, 3 vols., 1932-1934), parts of which have been translated into English by G.M.Goshgarian.
Biography
Oshagan was born in 1883 as Hagop Kufejian in Soloz, a village near Bursa. Oshagan was spared the fate of many of his fellow writers and was able to elude the Turkish secret police until early 1918, when he fled from Constantinople to Bulgaria, disguised as a German officer. After the armistice, he returned to Constantinople in 1919, where he adopted his literary surname, and taught literature, actively participating in the literary activities of the Armenian community. At the end of 1922, as many other Armenian intellectuals, he left Constantinople permanently after the arrival of the Kemalist forces. He lived for a brief time in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, and then worked as an instructor of Armenian literature in Egypt (1924-1928), Cyprus (1928-1935), and Palestine (1935-1948), where he forged a reputation as a charismatic educator and prolific writer of fiction, drama, and literary criticism. He died while on a visit to Aleppo, on the eve of a planned visit to Deir ez-Zor, where hundreds of thousands of Armenians had perished during the Armenian genocide.
The genocide of the Armenians defined Oshagan's larger project — the literary reconstruction of the lost ancestral homeland. He wrote his major works in exile. He devoted his knowledge of Armenian literature, his intimate experience of village life and of Turkish-Armenian relations to this project.
His output as a literary critic and historian is grounded in the monumental Panorama of Armenian Literature (Համապատկեր արեւմտահայ գրականութեան, 10 vols., 1945-1982), which has been used as a textbook in Armenian high schools. He is also the author of shorter, book-length volumes of literary studies.
His son Vahé Oshagan (1921-2000) followed in his father's footsteps. A poet, short story author, novelist, essayist, and literary scholar, he was one of the most important writers and public intellectuals of the Armenian diaspora.

Carl Röchling (October 18, 1855 – May 6, 1920) was a German painter and illustrator known for his representation of historical military themes.
Life
Röchling was born in Saarbrücken, part of the Prussian Rhine Province, son of Friedrich Röchling, a judiciary worker, and Angelika Stoll. He studied from 1875 to 1880 in the Karlsruhe Academy of Arts (Kunstschule) with Ludwig des Coudres and Ernst Hildebrand and later in the Prussian Academy of Arts.
While in Berlin, he was a pupil of the great master painter Anton von Werner, with whom he participated in the creation of various panoramic paintings such as Der Schlacht von Sedan ("The Battle of Sedan"). Later he became well known for his independent work of historical and military paintings in the turn of the 19th century. He died on May 6, 1920 in Berlin.
Works
Among Röchling's most famous works of military themes are various depictions of battle scenes of Prussian army victories, especially those during the Franco-Prussian War.
Together with Georg Koch and Eugen Bracht a panorama of the Battle of Chattanooga is among his works. He also worked in partnership with Richard Knötel and Woldemar Friedrich in illustrating two popular children books (Der Alte Fritz in 50 Bildern für Jung und Alt in 1895 and Die Königin Luise in 50 Bildern für Jung und Alt in 1896).

The Hoher Ochsenkopf ("High Ochsenkopf", literally "High Oxen Peak") is a mountain in the Northern Black Forest in the municipality of Forbach in south Germany. At it is the highest point in Forbach and also in the county of Rastatt. The mountain, whose domed summit or kuppe was already a nature reserve lies in the Black Forest National Park which was founded in 2014. Its name (which means "high oxen-peak") recalls its former use as wood pasture.
Location
The Hoher Ochsenkopf lies about six kilometres northeast of the highest mountain in the Northern Black Forest, the Hornisgrinde, which is 108 metres higher. Like the Badener Höhe three kilometres north it is part of an eastern spur of the main chain of the northern Black Forest, which runs between the Upper Rhine Plain and the Murg valley. This spur is bounded by two western side valleys of the Murg, the valley of the Hundsbach with the Forbach village of Hundsbach in the south and the Schwarzenbach valley with the village of Herrenwies in the north and the Schwarzenbach Dam in the northeast. The Hoher Ochsenkopf is linked to the Mittlerer Ochsenkopf ("middle oxen-peak", 1,004.9 m) to the south over the Kegelplatz, a 977-metre-high saddle. The 964-metre-high Vorderer Ochsenkopf ("anterior oxen-peak") adjoins the Mittlerer Ochsenkopf to the south and, further east, is the Nägeliskopf (994 m). In the northwest, the 948-metre-high saddle of Dreikohlplatten links the Hoher Ochsenkopf to the Mehliskopf (1008 m).
Hoher Ochsenkopf Nature Reserve
The flat and once deforested domed summit or kuppe, then a typical grinde of the Northern Black Forest, was used in past centuries as pasture. The forest recolonised the area after grazing ended. In 1970 a Bannwald forest, 41.1 hectares in area, was declared around the summit and, in 1975, it was turned into a nature reserve. In 1986, in order to protect the capercaillie, a bird reserve, 600 ha in area, was declared around the Hoher Ochsenkopf. In 2000 the Bannwald was extended to an area of 100.7 ha and complemented by the surrounding, 427 ha of Schonwald, a form of semi-protected forest, called the Nägeliskopf.
Numerous rare and endangered animal and plant species have settled here, including the three-toed woodpecker, which had been extinct for many years in the Black Forest.
Development
The Hoher Ochsenkopf is accessible on foot from Hundseck on the Black Forest High Road over a roughly three-kilometre-long ridgeway or after a steep climb from Herrenwies or Hundsbach-Aschenplatz/Bridge along the Kirchweg.
The start point is the östlichen Dreikohlplatten. From there a path marked by blue and white wooden posts leads initially gently uphill. Later it becomes unmarked and climbs steeply uphill to the point, where there used to be a seven-metre-high observation tower, built in 1902, that was replaced in 1927 by a 12-metre-high stone tower. After a lightning strike, it was blown up by the Technisches Hilfswerk in 1971. Even today the rubble pile of stone blocks is still visible. The path continues uphill towards the Teufelskamin ("Devil's Chimney"), an open fault in the Bunter sandstone that appears as a 20-metre-deep cave.
Around the Hoher Ochsenkopf runs the almost level Becker Way (Beckerweg), a circular walk re-established by the Black Forest Club branches of Hornisgrinde, Achern, Bühl and Baden-Baden in 2003. The path is named after Daniel Becker from Frankfurt, who stayed in the old Kurhaus at Hundseck more than 100 years ago and explored the region around the Hoher Ochsenkopf.

Alexander Khristoforovich Vostokov (born Alexander Woldemar Osteneck; ; – ) was one of the first Russian philologists.
Background
He was born into a Baltic German family in Arensburg, Governorate of Livonia, and studied at the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg. As a natural son of Baron von Osten-Sacken, he received the name Osteneck, which he later chose to render into Russian as Vostokov (Ost, the German word for "east," translates to vostok in Russian). He liked to experiment with language and, in one of his poems, introduced the female name Svetlana, which would gain popularity through Vasily Zhukovsky's eponymous ballad.
During his lifetime, Vostokov was known as a poet and translator, but it is his innovative studies of versification and comparative Slavonic grammars which proved most influential. In 1815, he joined the staff of the Imperial Public Library, where he discovered the most ancient dated book written in Slavonic vernacular, the so-called Ostromir Gospel. In 1841, Vostokov was elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Works
Vostokov's works on the Church Slavonic language were considered a high-water mark of Slavic studies until the appearance of Izmail Sreznevsky's comprehensive lexicon in 1893–1903 and garnered him the doctorates honoris causa from the Charles University and University of Tübingen.
Vostokov also laid foundations of modern Russian toponymy. In 1812, he published an article with the title "An example to the amateurs of etymology" (), where he argued that geographical names (toponyms) have repeating elements which he called formants and which help to restore the etymology of the name. For instance, the endings -va, -ga, and -ma in the end of such names as the Sylva, the Onega, and the Kama, may mean "water" in the languages these names originate from. Whereas this article did not get sufficient attention during Vostokov's life, it did subsequently receive recognition, and Vostokov is cited as one of the founders of toponymy in Russia.

Game summaries
Week 1: vs. Las Vegas Raiders
After both teams began the game with a field goal and a punt, Allen had back-to-back catches of 19 and 42 yards, moving the Chargers to the Las Vegas 11-yard line. Three plays later, Herbert gained only 3 yards on a 3rd and 4, but Nate Hobbs was penalised for unnecessary roughness, having hit Herbert as he entered a slide. That gave the Chargers a fresh set of downs, and Horvath's touchdown followed three plays later.
On the next Charger drive, Carter's 30-yard catch moved them into Raider territory. They reached a 3rd and 1 at the 28 before both Ekeler and Herbert were stopped for no gain, turning the ball over on downs. On the next two plays, Derek Carr was sacked by Mack and intercepted by Tranquill, who returned the ball 20 yards to the Raider 31. Two plays later, Herbert found Carter between two defenders in the front of the end zone for a 17–3 halftime lead.
A 41-yard catch by Davante Adams helped the Raiders score only five plays into the second half. The Chargers responded with a drive where Herbert completed 6 of 7 passes for 55 yards and a touchdown to Everett. Las Vegas converted a 4th and 4 on their next possession, reaching the Charger 25. The Raiders then tried a trick play, Bosa sacked Adams for a 10-yard and they eventually settled for Daniel Carlson's long field goal. The next two Raider drives ended with interceptions by Samuel (on a deep pass at his own 2), and Callahan (near midfield). The Chargers had a field goal try after the latter of these, but Hopkins was wide left from 49 yards out, and Las Vegas drove 61 yards for an Adams touchdown, trimming the deficit to five points. Adderley broke up the two-point conversion attempt in the end zone. Following a three-and-out by the Chargers, Las Vegas took over at their own 21-yard line with 3:30 to play. They reached a 3rd and 3 at their own 40 before Carr was sacked on consecutive plays, firstly by Bosa and Fox, then by Mack. Los Angeles took over on downs, and were able to run the clock out after Michel's 3-yard run on 3rd and 2.
All three Charger touchdowns were scored by players making their debut for the team. Another debutant, Mack, had three of the Chargers' six sacks. Los Angeles gained sixteen first downs on their first six drives, but only two from their final five. Allen left the game in the first half with a hamstring strain and did not return.
Week 2: at Kansas City Chiefs
Kansas City were forced to punt on their first two drives, and the Chargers responded with a field goal and a touchdown. On the touchdown drive, Herbert converted a 4th and inches with a quarterback sneak, and Williams caught a 39-yard pass to the Chiefs' 1-yard line; Horvath scored two plays later. A 3rd-down Adderley interception on the ensuing drive was nullified by an illegal contact penalty on Callahan, leading to Mahomes' first touchdown pass. Los Angeles crossed midfield on their next two possessions, but had to punt both times and led 10–7 at halftime.
The Chargers opened the second half with a 75-yard touchdown drive. Ekeler converted on 3rd and 1 early in the drive, and later on 4th and 1; on the next play, Williams made a juggling one-handed catch in the end zone. Patrick Mahomes threw his next pass directly to Samuel, who initially mishandled the ball before diving forward and gathering it near the ground. Los Angeles were initially awarded the ball at the Kansas City 35, but the turnover was overturned on official review, with some controversy. Mahomes then led the Chiefs to another touchdown. Late in the 3rd quarter, Kansas City had a 3rd and goal at the Charger 1, but Joseph and Bosa stopped Travis Kelce for no gain, and the Chiefs settled for a game-tying field goal. Los Angeles then drove into Chiefs territory, where Everett had back-to-back catch-and-runs of 7 and 26 yards, moving the ball to the 3. Everett asked to be taken out of the game due to fatigue after the second catch, but was unable to leave as the Chargers were in a hurry-up offense. He failed to break on the ball on the next play; Herbert's pass was intercepted and returned 99 yards for a touchdown. Clyde Edwards-Helaire broke off a 52-yard run late in the game, allowing the Chiefs to pad their lead with a field goal. Herbert converted two 4th downs on the next drive, the latter to Palmer for a touchdown, but Kansas City recovered an onside kick and ran out the clock.
Herbert played on after sustaining fractured rib cartilage late in the game. Horvath became the first running back or fullback to score receiving touchdowns in the first two games of his career since 1942.

The MRT Brown Line is a 22.1 km rapid transit line in Bangkok, Thailand proposed monorail mass transit line from Nonthaburi Civic Centre, Nonthaburi Province to Lam Sali intersection, Bang Kapi District. 20 stations are proposed for the line and the expected cost for the project is 48 billion baht. The line has been integrated for 7.2km with the N2 expressway project and a feasibility study has been completed. The MRT Brown line will interchange with 7 other mass transit lines.
The MRT Brown line investment plan was approved by the MRTA Board in June 2019 for final detailed design, which was expected to be completed by December 2020. However, the detailed design will take longer and is not expected to be completed until September 2022. In mid May 2022, the MRTA received updated consultants studies and will soon start drafting the TOR for the project. The project will still require final Cabinet approval and is now planned to be tendered in 2023.
Route Alignment
The MRT Brown Line starts at Nonthaburi Civic Centre where it interchanges with both the MRT Purple Line & MRT Pink Lines. It heads east along Ngam Wong Wan road through Khae Rai intersection and then Vihavadi-Rangsit road to interchange with the SRT Dark Red Line at Bang Khen. The Brown line continues past Kasetsart University to interchange with the BTS Sukhumvit Line at Kasetsart University on Phahon Yothin Road.
The line continues east along Prasote Manukitch Road (AKA Kaset-Nawamin Road) past Chalong Rat Expressway (interchanging with the proposed BMA Grey Line) to Nawamin Road. The line then turns south along Nawamin Road over Lam Phang Phuai lake and past Klong Chan Stadium. The line continues further southeast along Nawamin Road where it then terminates at Ramkhamhaeng rd (soi 129/1), Lam Sali junction to interchange with the MRT Orange Line and MRT Yellow Line.
History
The line was first proposed as the Gold Line by the Pheu Thai party (พรรคเพื่อไทย) for the Bangkok Governors election held in March 2013. This was in response to objections by Kasetsart University and as an alternative to a long-proposed elevated Expressway extension, the N2 expressway project. However, the Pheu Thai candidate did not win the election and the Gold Line proposal was dropped with the then Deputy Minister of Transport stating that land appropriation costs were too high. (The Gold Line name was later used for the BMA Gold Line ).
Subsequently, the Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning (OTP) reworked the Gold Line proposal into a new MRT Brown Line monorail proposal and this was endorsed by the MRTA Board in August 2013. The route was under preliminary study by OTP from June 2013, but did not progress much before the May 2014 coup and change of government. Subsequently, the route was finalised by OTP and public hearings into the project were held during 2017 as the government proposed integrating the design with a new expressway. In mid-2017, the MOT announced that a final feasibility study would be completed over 14 months.
Note: This line is not to be confused with the original OTP 2004 13 km MRT Brown Line proposal from Bangkapi to Min Buri which was taken to the 2005 election. In 2009, this plan was subsequently changed and the original 13 km Brown Line was merged into an extended MRT Orange Line, which is currently under construction.
Progress
In August 2013, the MRTA approved the MRT Brown line in principle to complete the design by 2016 with an expected 3-year construction period for a 2021 opening. However, the line was delayed while a long planned expressway along much of the same route was prioritized. Public hearings on the Brown line was held in 2017. The MOT announced that a 14-month feasibility study into the line would be completed by 2018.
The feasibility study was undertaken during the same period where design for the N2 expressway (which runs along Kaset-Namawin rd) was being finalised by EXAT without catering for the MRT Brown Line. Work was expected to commence on the expressway in 2019. OTP and MOT subsequently proposed an integrated design and construction of the Brown Line jointly with the N2 expressway which was approved by Cabinet. However, the Brown Line crossing of Vihavadi-Rangsit rd and the Don Muang elevated expressway might require a diversion of the Brown Line further north for the line to pass at this point depending on the final route design of the N2 expressway. In February 2018, OTP confirmed that the study integrating the MRT Brown Line with the Expressway design would be done by June 2018.
By August 2018, OTP had completed the feasibility study and conducted public hearings. Although, there was much public support for building the MRT Brown line, public opposition to the N2 expressway remained high. OTP intended to submit the project for Cabinet approval by the end of October 2018. In early June 2019, the MRTA Board approved the investment plan for the Brown Line and integrated design with the N2 Expressway conducted by EXAT. The design process was expected to be completed by late 2020 after further discussions regarding land access around Kasetsart University were conducted between EXAT, the MRTA, the Rural Highways Department and Kasetsart University in June 2020. In early November 2020, the MRTA Governor stated that the OTP had submitted the preliminary Environment (EIA) to the National Environment Board for review and that land expropriation surveys in some areas along the route were still being finalised. Final design was expected to be completed by December 2020. However, the detailed design will take longer and is not expected to be completed until September 2022.
The project is expected to be tendered in 2023.

Center Party (, ) is a registered political party in Norway. The party was established by several former county leaders from the Christian Democratic Party, defectors from the Socialist Left Party, the Labour Party, the Conservative Party and the Green Party, as well as former city councilor for the Labour Party in Oslo Geir Lippestad. The party's youth organization is Unge Sentrum.
In the party platform, the party has decided to be a bloc-independent center party based on the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The party wanted a change of government after the 2021 Norwegian parliamentary election. The party received 0.3% of the votes in the elections.
Opinion polls
In December 2020, the party secured enough signatures to run lists in all counties for the 2021 parliamentary election. The Center Party was measured in opinion polls in the winter of 2020/21 between 0.0 and 0.7 per cent support.
In the spring of 2021, Norstat conducted a nationwide survey commissioned by the Center Party, to answer how the party fared before the parliamentary elections in 2021. 2% of the 1,000 respondents answered "yes" to the question of whether they considered voting for the party in the autumn elections. 9% answered "maybe", and 13% answered "do not know".

The Szczecin County was a county centered around the town of Police, that existed from 1946 to 1975.Jan Matura: Historia Polic od czasów najstarszego osadnictwa do II wojny światowej. vol. 2. Police: Urząd Gminy w Policach, 2002, p. 153–154. ISBN 83-914853-5-8.
History
Szczecin County was established on 29 May 1946, and was located within the District of the Western Pomerania, that was under the administration of the Provisional Government of National Unity. It was formed from the former districts of Randow and Ueckermünde that belonged to the Nazi Germany, and the Veletian County. The District of the Western Pomerania was disestablished on 28 June 1946, and replaced by the Szczecin Voivodeship. In 1946, it had 11 758 inhabitants, and an area of 402 km².
It remained under the control of the Provisional Government until 19 February 1947, when the Polish People's Republic was established in its place. The county existed until 1 June 1975, when it was abolished due to the new administrative reform, with its territory being incorporated into then-established Szczecin Voivodeship. Its capital was Szczecin, which itself wasn't part of the county, and existed as the separate city county instead. The city was chosen as the seat for the county, due to the existence the Enclave of Police from 1945 to 1946, which slowed the development of the town of Police, that would otherwise have been chosen for the seat instead. In 1999, Police County was established within the same borders as the former Szczecin County.

KYDE was a radio station on 1590 kHz in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.
History
KPBA signed on October 16, 1957, beginning commercial operation on the 22nd. The station was owned by W. L. Kent, trading as Radio Pine Bluff, and operated during the daytime with 1,000 watts. Four days in, on October 25, it played the same record over and over for six hours, drawing hundreds to the new station and prompting over 8,000 phone calls, before revealing the stunt was designed to promote KPBA as mostly music. Kent held a majority stake in KPBA until 1964, when Bruce Gresham and J.C. Noble bought the station for $27,500. Gresham bought out Noble's share in KPBA in 1973 for $10,000.
In 1975, KPBA, Inc., owned by owners mostly from Mississippi, acquired the station for $155,000. The new ownership changed the call letters to KYDE on March 8, 1976. Under the new call letters, the outlet was sold again in 1978 to Smith, Davis and Shields, Inc., all owners of KGMR in Jacksonville, Arkansas, for $325,000.
The carousel of owners continued into the 1980s, when Southwest Communications purchased the outlet for $307,000. Under Southwest, KYDE was an urban radio station programmed to serve the African American community in Pine Bluff. It also received approval to begin broadcasting at night with 500 watts. Southwest attempted to sell the station in 1985 to Elmer Dancy, owner of an oil company, for $385,000, offering to finance the purchase if the seller could not arrange financing. However, Dancy ultimately could not work financially, and the bank foreclosed on the station; Southwest repurchased the station in 1991 after filing to receive the license from the bankruptcy trustee two years earlier.
In 1997, KYDE aired a black gospel/Southern gospel format. The station's license was deleted in 1998.

Georg Hirth (13 July 1841 in Tonna – 28 March 1916 in Tegernsee) was a German writer, journalist and publisher. He is best known for founding the cultural magazine Jugend in 1896, which was instrumental in popularizing Art Nouveau.
Biography
Hirth was born in Tonna, present-day Thuringia in 1841, studied to be an economist in Gotha and in Leipzig, and after a career working as a journalist he founded the magazine Jugend: Münchner illustrierte Wochenschrift für Kunst und Leben (Youth: the illustrated weekly magazine of art and lifestyle of Munich). This publication, which reflected the modernist ideals that were circulating at the time among artists, was instrumental in promoting the style of Art Nouveau in Germany. As a result, the magazine's name was adopted as the most common German-language term for the movement: Jugendstil ("Jugend-style"). Hirth also coined the term "Secession" to represent the spirit of the various modern and reactionary movements of the era.<ref>Nicolas Powell, "Review of C. Nebehay, Ver Sacrum, 1898–1903," The Burlington Magazine, vol. 118 (Sep. 1976): 660.</ref> He died in Tegernsee in 1916.

Mollie Johnson was a 19th-century madam in Deadwood, South Dakota. Johnson was born in Alabama, and migrated west due to the demand for working prostitutes. Indications are that she began working that trade in her early teens, around the age of 15 or 16 by some reports. However, definite information on her early life is unconfirmed.
She first appeared in Deadwood shortly after the gold rush, and was first mentioned in public writing in February, 1878, when she married Lew Spencer, an African American comedian who was performing at the time in the Bella Union Theater. Although married, Johnson continued to work in her chosen profession, both as prostitute and madam.
Reportedly a widow before her arrival in Deadwood, and in her early to mid-20s, Johnson was described as being a pretty woman, and a very good businesswoman. She was also a known supporter of Irish Famine Relief. The competition for brothel owners in Deadwood was light, as there were very few girls to choose from, but plenty of men. Her main competition during most of her time in Deadwood was Madam Dora DuFran, but there is no indication that the two madams did not get along.
Spencer eventually left Deadwood and was later arrested in Denver, Colorado for shooting his other wife. Evidently Spencer had been married to both a woman in Denver, and Johnson. There are no indications that Johnson and Spencer ever saw one another afterwards.
The brothel houses were described in the papers as being a resort for naughty men. Mollie Johnson was also noted to be of a kind heart, caring for the dead body of one of her girls, before trying to save her possessions in the "Big Deadwood Fire" of September 26, 1879.
After the destruction of the brothel, which stood on the corner of Sherman and Lee Streets, she immediately opened another brothel, and suffered two more fires over the course of the years. She reportedly left Deadwood, as business dropped off, in January, 1883. Where she went or what happened to her following her departure of Deadwood is unknown.

HM Prison Chelmsford is a Category B men's prison and Young Offenders Institution, located in Chelmsford, Essex, England. The prison is operated by His Majesty's Prison Service.
History
Chelmsford Prison began as a county jail in 1825 before transforming into a Category B prison, a young person's prison, and a local prison. It was expanded in 1996.
The prison's main entrance was originally through an austere stone-built porter's lodge in the middle of the Springfield Road frontage. The lodge's flat roof was designed to support the gallows scaffold and drop, while the forecourt could easily accommodate the hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of spectators that would congregate for an execution.
Originally called Springfield Prison, from 1825 to the end of 1914 43 people were hanged.
The first 'private' execution at Springfield was that of Michael Campbell on 24th April 1871. The 28 year old Berwick born tailor and former soldier was convicted of murder of Samuel Galloway (49), a retired dockworker in Stratford.
The oldest man to be hanged in the 20th century in Britain was 71 year old German born grocer Charles Fremd who was executed on 4th November 1914 for murdering hjs wife at Leytonstone. She was found dead from a cut throat. Her husband was beside her with only a minor self-inflicted wound. As Fremd was dropped he caught and bruised his head on the trap door. Shortly after Fremd's death the prison was taken over by the army for use as a military gaol, and after it reverted to civilian use in 1931 there were no further executions Thus, the oldest man was also the last man to feel the noose around his neck at Springfield Prison.
In 1999 the management at Chelmsford Prison were severely criticised by the Chief Inspector of Prisons, after findings that staff were failing to respond to cell alarms five years after a prisoner was beaten to death by his cell-mate. The prison was also criticised for unacceptably bad conditions of cleanliness. A further inspection a year later confirmed these failings at the prison. In 2002, "conditions at Chelmsford...[were] condemned as 'poor and cramped' by the gaol's board of visitors."
However, in 2005, Chelmsford was praised in its inspection for improving standards and procedures for inmates at the prison. This was confirmed a year later by the Independent Monitoring Board which praised the new management at the prison.
On 25 December 2007, 18-year-old Abdullah Hagar Idris hanged himself in the prison after he was told that he was going to be deported.
In January 2013, the Ministry of Justice announced that older parts of Chelmsford prison will close, with a reduction of 132 places at the gaol.
In December 2015 a riot lead to six members of staff needing hospital treatment.
The prison today
Chelmsford Prison accepts adult male prisoners and Young Offenders, convicted or on remand direct from courts within its local catchment area.
Education at the prison is contracted to Milton Keynes College, and courses offered include literacy, numeracy, information technology, art, barbering, journalism, cookery, ESOL as well as social and life programs. The prison's gym also offers physical education with industry-related qualifications, as well as recreational gym.
In addition, the prison has links to, and facilities provided by, organisations such as the Job Centre and the Samaritans. There is also a Prison Visitor Centre operated by the Ormiston Children and Families Trust.
Staffing at the prison has been reduced by 25%. According to the Independent Monitoring Board bullying, violence and self-harm have increased markedly at the prison due to staff shortages. Budget cuts and the inability of the prison service to recruit and retain staff lead to fears for prison safety. The prison is becoming more dangerous and less effective. Prison health care provided by Care UK is considered poor, there were delays in getting medication and reliance on agency staff to fill vacancies.
There is insufficient secure mental health accommodation outside' the prison for the most vulnerable inmates. The Independent Monitoring Board stated that the "level of service being provided to care for prisoners' physical and mental health needs remains inadequate" Due to staff shortages the staff were unable to provide engagement work or education for prisoners. Illegal drugs are a problem. Use of force by staff is increasing and there is insufficient monitoring if this use is appropriate. Prisoners must spend too long in their cells. Physical and mental health services for prisoners were found to be inadequate. The staff try to engage prisoners. Money is not available for needed renovation of the Victorian building.
Following the death of a vulnerable inmate in January 2017 and criticism by the Prison Ombudsman, Care UK announced it would end its healthcare contract there as the level of resource the prison service made available was insufficient.
Drug use is a serious problem at HMP Chelmsford according to HM Inspectorate of Prisons (42.6% of prisoners failed drug tests) and organised gangs supply prohibited items. Inspectors describe, "significant concerns about safety" and excessive levels of violence, much of the violence is due to supply and use of prohibited substances. Overcrowding and under-resourcing are blamed. Peter Clarke said the rising violence, suicides, accessibility of drugs and bad living conditions made him consider using the Urgent Notification protocol, which would make the Justice Secretary take action. In one month, prison authorities seized £15,000 worth of illegal goods. There were 17 suicides at Chelmsford during the 8 years to 2018 and 5 of them were since the inspection in 2016. For examples of suicides, see Notable former inmates. Deborah Coles of Inquest said the prison was, "incredibly unsafe [the rate of suicides] suggests that the plethora of recommendations following previous self-inflicted deaths have not been implemented. Inquests repeatedly identify the same systemic failings with dismal regularity. Recent inquests into deaths at Chelmsford prison have highlighted failures around the management of self-harm procedures, a lack of staff training in mental health awareness, inadequate risk assessments and failures in responding to bullying. The failure to implement existing guidelines on the care of those at risk indicates a lack of care, neglect and inhuman treatment from punitive and often inflexible prison regimes." Coles urged the setting up of a national group to supervise how lessons from inquests and reports are carried out, the group to be accountable to Parliament. Problems inspectors drew attention to included that 40% of prisoners who did not take part in activities were locked in their cells for up to 22 hours a day and items including mattresses and pillows were in short supply. The Howard League for Penal Reform maintain Chelmsford was designed to hold 521 men but the prison actually held 700 men when it was inspected.

Warren Sampson, hanged himself in Chelmsford Prison on 4 September 2015. Sampson's mother contacted the prison hours before his death because she was worried about messages he had sent her but the prison failed to safeguard Sampson. The prison ombudsman said suicide and self-harm procedures, "did not operate fully effectively" and "staff missed signs that Mr Sampson's vulnerability and risk of suicide had increased". Following a mental health review, a counsellor was worried about his anxiety and over a noose he had made, but prison staff did not, "explore this further". The charity INQUEST said Chelmsford Prison, with one of the highest suicide rates in the nation, made, "the same systemic failings with dismal regularity".
Dean Saunders, 25, killed himself at HMP Chelmsford in January 2016. An Inquest jury found Saunders was downgraded from continuous watch to half hour checks for financial reasons and neglect contributed to his death. Care UK, a private company running healthcare at Chelmsford, "treated financial consideration as a significant reason to reduce the level of observations" although they were warned repeatedly about Dean's mental condition. Dean's mother pleaded with staff to keep him under constant watch. The jury stated Mr Saunders "and his family were let down by serious failings by mental health services and prison system" and that assessing his mental health needs was "not adequately conducted" with "multiple failings in recording and passing on information". Dean's family stated, "Hospital, not prison, is where Dean deserved and needed to be. We as a family, together with our lawyers and Inquest, want Dean's death to mark the end of empty promises and the start of change." The Prison Ombudsman also found significant risk factors were ignored when observation of Dean Saunders was cut back. The ombudsman found those trying to care for Dean felt he should be in a mental health facility rather than prison. The ombudsman added, "I am also concerned that there appears to have been some confusion at Chelmsford about the process for transferring mentally ill prisoners to hospital, which meant that an opportunity to transfer Mr Saunders in December [of 2015] was missed. Sadly, the criminal justice system did too little to protect this very vulnerable man." Dean's father, Mark Saunders said, "There was no proper medical structure there [in prison] to help him. We were lied to and mislead all the way through. We were devastated."
In 1990 former professional footballer Tony Adams spent 57 days of a four month sentence in HMP Chelmsford for drink-driving.
In popular culture
The 1979 film Porridge (a film version of the Porridge TV series) was filmed almost entirely on location at Chelmsford Prison in freezing conditions in January 1979. The prison was unoccupied at the time because it was being refurbished after a fire in one of the wings.
The punk rock band The Sex Pistols recorded a live album here called Live at Chelmsford Top Security Prison.

Highfields was the home of Charles and Anne Lindbergh, the famous aviators. It was the location of the Lindbergh kidnapping, after which it was turned into a rehabilitation center. The home was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.
Construction
The Lindberghs built Highfields in 1931 on a secluded spot of the Sourland Mountain so as to escape the spotlight brought on by their celebrity status. After his pioneering solo flight from New York to Paris in 1927, four million people had attended the ticker tape parade in Charles Lindbergh's honor, and he had received two million congratulatory telegrams, making him one of the most famous Americans of the century. The Sourland Mountain location, while secluded, afforded easy access by air and automobile to the Lindberghs' offices in New York City and to the laboratories of nearby Princeton University, to which they had been granted access.
Lindbergh kidnapping
The home was the site of one of the most notorious crimes of the 20th century, the Lindbergh kidnapping, often called the "Crime of the Century". On the evening of March 1, 1932, the Lindberghs' oldest son, 20-month-old Charles Lindbergh, Jr., was abducted by means of a ladder from a second floor window of Highfields, aided by a warped shutter which could not be closed. Over two months later, the baby's body was discovered a short distance from Highfields in Hopewell Township with a massive skull fracture. After a more than two-year investigation, Bruno Richard Hauptmann was arrested, tried in one of the so-called trials of the century, and convicted of the crime. He was executed by electric chair at New Jersey State Prison on April 3, 1936. Nevertheless, speculation has continued to run rampant, as most investigators at the time of the initial investigation, as well as contemporary researchers, believe there was inside help.
Rehabilitation center
The headquarters of the search for Charles Lindbergh, Jr. was in the garage of Highfields. After Lindbergh identified the body of his son they left the house never to spend another night there, returning to Anne's family home in Englewood, New Jersey. The attention from the trial led the Lindberghs to a self-imposed exile in Europe from 1935 to 1939. In June 1933, Anne wrote that the house would be turned over to a board of trustees, and she named it "Highfields," saying the name carried some secret meaning. One biographer has speculated that it commemorates the young Lindbergh's special greeting to his father.
In 1941 the home was conveyed to the State of New Jersey by the Highfields Association, in memory of Charles Lindbergh. It has been used since July 1, 1952 as a juvenile rehabilitation center by the New Jersey Department of Corrections.

Henry Sanborn Noyes (December 24, 1822 – May 24, 1872) was a president of Northwestern University.
Biography
Noyes was born in Landaff, New Hampshire, on December 24, 1822, to devout Methodist parents. He was graduated from Wesleyan University like many of Northwestern's presidents and early professors. Noyes graduated (in 1848) from the university just 9 years after Clark T. Hinman, the first president of Northwestern, graduated from the institution. Noyes actually studied under Hinman at Newbury Seminary in Montpelier, Vermont (where Hinman was president at the time) shortly thereafter. After Hinman's departure from Newbury Seminary in 1853, Noyes himself became its president.
When Clark Hinman and a group of other Chicago-area Methodists decided to establish a new university near Chicago, Illinois, to serve the old Northwest Territory, Hinman remembered working with Noyes and asked Noyes to join the new faculty.
Noyes was one of the two original faculty members of the university when it opened in 1855 and served (primarily) as professor of mathematics. When Clark Hinman, the first president of the university, died in 1854, Noyes served as interim president until the election of Randolph S. Foster in 1856. Then, when Foster abdicated his position as president in 1860, Noyes once again served as interim president (1860 to 1867). During his time at Northwestern, Noyes intermittently served a variety of positions alongside his teaching duties (e.g. serving as Secretary of the Board of Trustees and as the university's financial agent).

Daron Schoenrock (born November 21, 1961) is an American baseball coach and former pitcher. He played college baseball for the Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles from 1981 to 1984. He then served as the head coach of the Lincoln Memorial Railsplitters (1988–1989) and the Memphis Tigers (2005–2022). He is currently the pitching coach at Auburn.
Playing career
Schoenrock was a pitcher at Tennessee Tech, starting games in all four years before earning his degree in 1984.
Coaching career
After completing his studies at Tennessee Tech, Schoenrock became a graduate assistant coach for one season at his alma mater. He then moved to Murray State where he completed a master's and served as an assistant for two seasons. Schoenrock then earned his first head coaching position at Division II Lincoln Memorial. He coached for two seasons with the Railsplitters, leading the team to their first postseason appearance in five years and earning conference coach of the year honors in 1989. During that season, Lincoln Memorial played all of their games on the road due to work on their home stadium.
Following his stint with LMU, Schoenrock became a pitching coach at Birmingham–Southern, then an NAIA school. In his eight seasons with the Panthers, he became a highly regarded pitching coach, authoring a book on all aspects of pitching, helping the Panthers reach the NAIA College World Series, and earning a summer posting as a short-season pitching coach in the Chicago White Sox organization in 1995. He then began a series of short stints as a pitching coach at Southeastern Conference schools, working two years at Kentucky, two years at Georgia and three years at Mississippi State. During this time, he coached a series of pro prospects, including Brandon Webb, Jonathan Papelbon, and Paul Maholm.
Schoenrock was named head coach of the Memphis Tigers before the 2005 season. After a rough first year, he led the Tigers to 32 wins in his second season, marking the second best improvement in wins in the nation that year. The Tigers appeared in the 2007 NCAA Tournament and frequently advance to the Conference USA Baseball Tournament under Schoenrock. The team has also performed well in the classroom, posting GPA's well over 3.2 as a team. These successes, as well as strong recruiting, have led to a contract extension for Schoenrock and helped build excitement for the Tigers' entry to the Big East Conference.
Schoenrock was named pitching coach for the Auburn Tigers on August 1, 2022.
Head coaching records
Below is a table of Schoenrock's yearly records as an NCAA head baseball coach.
Personal

Mitchell J. Chang is a Professor of Higher Education and Organizational Change and Asian American Studies (by courtesy) at the University of California, Los Angeles. From March 2018- February 2022, Chang served as the Editor-in-Chief of The Journal of Higher Education.
Early life and education
Born in Taiwan, Chang immigrated to San Jose, California in 1971, where his father pursued a career in Silicon Valley. He and his family are beneficiaries of the Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which made it illegal to practice housing discrimination. He noted that this federal legislation made exposure to diversity an “inescapable reality” for him and his family, but racism was still very present.
Upon matriculating at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Chang was exposed to ethnic studies and the broader diversity of the university, which helped him understand better the educational implications of his childhood exposure to a wide range of racial and cultural differences. This continued at Harvard University and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where Chang also examined issues informed by his work in the San Jose public school system and by the national controversy over affirmative action. His UCLA doctoral dissertation was one of the first studies to test former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell's claims about the educational benefits of exposure to racial diversity in his opinion on the case Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke 438 U.S. 265 (1978), which is often referred to as the diversity rationale for justifying race conscious admissions practices in U.S. higher education.
Career
Chang's research focuses on the educational efficacy of diversity-related initiatives on college campuses and how to apply those best practices toward advancing student learning and democratizing institutions. He has written over one hundred publications, some of which were cited in the U.S. Supreme Court ruling of Grutter v. Bollinger, one of two cases involving the use of race sensitive admissions practices at the University of Michigan. Chang received a National Academy of Education/Spencer Foundation Fellowship in 2001 and was awarded the Outstanding Outcomes Assessment Research Award, 1999-2000 by the American College Personnel Association for conducting one of the first studies to document empirically the positive educational impact of racial diversity on students' learning and college experiences. In 2006, he was profiled as one of the nation's top ten scholars by Diverse: Issues in Higher Education and in 2008, he and his co-researchers received the ACPA Asian Pacific American Network Outstanding Contribution to APIDA Research Award. Chang has also served in elected positions for both the American Educational Research Association (At-Large Member of AERA Executive Council & Division J), which inducted him as a Fellow in 2016, and the Association for the Study of Higher Education (Board of Directors), which awarded him the Founder's Service Award in 2014 and the Research Achievement Award in 2020. He has served on many national advisory panels, including for the U.S. Department of Education, White House Domestic Policy Council, National Science Foundation, National Institute of Health, and College Board, and was the Editor-in-Chief for The Journal of Higher Education. Chang previously worked as Associate Dean at Loyola Marymount University, where he helped to supervise the structuring and teaching of the undergraduate diversity course requirement and as a school evaluator at the Alum Rock Elementary School District in San Jose, where he oversaw the achievement testing program

The December 17–22, 2012 North American blizzard was a winter storm that affected the Midwestern and Eastern United States. Forming on December 17, the winter storm moved across the midwest, forcing schools to close throughout the region. Numerous warnings and advisories had been posted by the National Weather Service for many states, including Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Both O'Hare International Airport and Midway International Airport in Chicago, Illinois canceled most departures and arrivals. According to flight tracking website FlightStats.com, more than 1,000 flights were canceled across the region. More than 130,000 customers were without power across the west and midwest.
In addition to snow, strong thunderstorms and possible tornadoes went across the Southern United States. A multiple-car pileup on Interstate 35 in Fort Dodge, Iowa killed two people, according to the Iowa State Patrol. American Airlines, American Eagle Airlines, and Southwest Airlines collectively canceled a total of 573 flights in the midwest. Greyhound Lines also canceled service in Chicago, Minneapolis, and Indianapolis.
The storm moved east towards the Northeast and New England. Winter storm and blizzard warnings were issued from north New York to western Pennsylvania.
Meteorological synopsis
On December 17, an upper-level shortwave and associated trough made landfall along the coast of the Pacific Northwest. The system initially moved towards the southeast, strengthening over the Rocky Mountains. This led to the development and formation of a surface low over eastern Colorado early on December 19. The low began to curve towards the northeast, and its barometric pressure began to deepen. The low attained its lowest pressure at 1800 UTC on December 20 over northern Illinois. However, the system became occluded, and as such moved quickly to the northeast, where it weakened and subsequently dissipated over southern Ontario late on December 21. Another low pressure area formed in the vicinity of the previous low over the East Coast of the United States, which quickly moved north across the coast, bringing heavy snowfalls to the region. The low later exited the continental United States on December 22. During the next several days, the winter storm drifted northeastward, and eventually to the south of Greenland, before finally being absorbed by another more powerful extratropical cyclone just south of Iceland, on December 29.
Impact
Southern United States
Arkansas
A dry line associated with the system moved east across eastern Oklahoma and northwestern Arkansas, helping to trigger thunderstorm and shower development across Arkansas. The thunderstorms produced wind gusts as high as , downing trees and power lines. Power outages affected 40,000 people throughout the state as a result of the storms. South of Delight, Arkansas, at least three barns were displaced due to the strong winds. Hail measuring up to was recorded in Logan County, Arkansas. In addition, dust from drought stricken areas was carried aloft into the storm system, falling to the ground and thus coating cars in mud.
One of these thunderstorms also spawned a short lived tornado near Lavaca, Arkansas on December 19. The tornado was rated as an EF1 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, after damaging various trees, homes, and blowing roofs off of structures. A second EF1 tornado was reported west of Sheridan, Arkansas the following day, destroying a mobile home.
Alabama
Strong storms began to develop and organize ahead of a cold front produced by the winter storm in the early hours of December 20. One of these storms developed off the Louisiana coast, before strengthening and moving ashore in Alabama. The storm developed strong rotation in its updraft and a mesocyclone formed. As a result, the storm spawned a tornado, later rated as an EF1, that moved across areas of northwest Mobile, Alabama. The tornado damaged various homes and businesses in the area. Other storms that formed across Alabama caused power outages to 18,000 people, of which 8,600 people were in Mobile.

The Philip Sheedy affair was an Irish political and judicial controversy which resulted in the resignation of both a Supreme Court and High Court judge.
Background
Philip Sheedy, an architect, was involved in a road traffic accident in March 1996 at the Glenview Roundabout, Tallaght Bypass, County Dublin which resulted in the death of Anne Ryan. It transpired that Sheedy, who was driving a high performance sports car that he had purchased the previous day, was intoxicated. Sheedy pled guilty to causing death by dangerous driving before Judge Cyril Kelly (as he was then) in Dublin Circuit Criminal Court in October 1997 and also admitted to driving with excess alcohol. On the day of sentencing Judge Joseph Mathews was asked by Judge Kelly to step-in and sentence Sheedy. Judge Matthews imposed a four-year sentence on Sheedy with leave to apply for a review of the sentence after two years (20 October 1999), as well as banning him from driving for twelve years. On 6 November 1997 Judge Mathews granted an application on Sheedy's behalf to vacate the order which set 20 October 1999 as the review date of Sheedy's sentence.
Sheedy, after initially being incarcerated in Mountjoy Prison, was moved to Shelton Abbey, an open prison, after six months' imprisonment. There he was visited by his friend Joe Burke, a former Fianna Fáil councillor and a member of the so-called "Drumcondra Mafia", who had loaned the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, 3,500 Irish pounds as part of the "dig outs" Ahern received around the time of his marriage break-up. Burke, who worked as a building contractor, had employed Sheedy as an architectural advisor to his company J&H Burke and Son.
In July 1998 the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, contacted then minister for justice John O'Donoghue to ask him whether it would be possible for Philip Sheedy to get day release. Initially, Ahern had vehemently denied that he concealed his representations to the Department of Justice on behalf of Philip Sheedy.
Sentence review and release
Supreme Court judge Hugh O'Flaherty intervened on Sheedy's behalf after an "entirely by chance" encounter between the judge, who was walking his dog, and the son of a neighbour Ken Anderson and Anderson's girlfriend, who was Philip Sheedy's sister, in October 1998. After the encounter, Dublin County Registrar Michael Quinlan was called to Mr. Justice O'Flaherty's chambers to have Sheedy's case re-listed.
On 12 November 1998, after O'Flaherty's intervention, Sheedy's sentence was reviewed before Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly, and not Judge Matthews, as would be the correct procedure. After the brief hearing Mr. Justice Kelly remitted what was left of Sheedy's sentence. Neither the gardaí nor the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) were told of the review or the fact that Sheedy was released. The only representation by the state was the appearance of a clerk in the Chief State Solicitor's office who saw a listing for the matter and brought the file to court but did not know for what purpose.
Fallout
High Court challenge
The DPP brought a High Court challenge to Mr. Justice Kelly's decision to release Sheedy in February 1999. Prior to the case being heard Sheedy had voluntarily returned to prison.
Hamilton Report
On the basis of the DPP's High Court challenge John O'Donoghue, then Minister for Justice asked Chief Justice Liam Hamilton to investigate the affair. The Chief Justice's report was published 16 April 1999. In it, Chief Justice Hamilton stated that Mr. Justice Kelly's handling of the matter and Mr. Justice O'Flaherty's intervention compromised the administration of justice.
Resignations
The first person to resign was Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty. In his report, Chief Justice Hamilton was critical of O'Flaherty whose actions he deemed to be "open to misinterpretation." Initially, O'Flaherty refused to resign, and instead wrote to the Chairman of the Oireachtas's Justice, Equality and Women's Affairs Committee asking to make a statement to the committee as soon as possible, however, the next day he resigned from the Supreme Court.
On 20 April, Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly and Michael Quinlan, the Dublin County Registrar, resigned their positions.
O'Flaherty appointment to EIB
After his resignation Hugh O'Flaherty was nominated by Charlie McCreevy, then Minister for Finance, to be Ireland's representative to the European Investment Bank (EIB), taking the position of vice-president. This appointment resulted in a massive public outcry. The appointment was eventually withdrawn by the government.

Nielsen played in her first international events in 2004, as an alternate for the Madeleine Dupont rink. Even though she was an alternate, she played many games. At the 2004 World Junior Curling Championships, the team finished 6th and at the 2004 Ford World Women's Curling Championship they finished in 8th. They finished in 8th place at the 2004 European Curling Championships.
Later that season, Nielsen was promoted to third on the team and they won a silver medal at the 2005 European Youth Olympic Winter Festival. She then played second on the team at the 2005 World Junior Curling Championships, where the rink finished 4th. At the 2005 World Women's Curling Championship, the rink finished in 10th.
The following season, Nielsen moved to play second for Dorthe Holm's rink. They won a bronze medal at the 2005 European Curling Championships and finished in 8th place at the 2006 Winter Olympics. Also that season, Nielsen skipped the Danish team to a bronze medal finish at the 2006 World Junior Curling Championships.
At this point, Nielsen left the main Danish team to form her own rink. At the 2007 European Curling Championships, she skipped Denmark to a bronze medal. At the 2010 European Curling Championships, she skipped Denmark to a 5th-place finish.
In 2011, Nielsen won her first World Curling Tour event at the International Bernese Ladies Cup.

She had another successful Euros when her Danish team finished 4th at the 2011 European Curling Championships. She returned to the world championships in 2012 in Lethbridge, Alberta, but failed to reach the playoffs, finishing with a 5–6 record.
The following season, Nielsen's Danish rink once again finished 4th at the 2012 European Curling Championships. Her team made the World Championships again, but finished with a worse result, a 4–7 record.
Nielsen's rink played in their first Grand Slam event at the 2013 Curlers Corner Autumn Gold Curling Classic, where they won two games, but were eliminated before the playoffs. She skipped Denmark at the 2013 European Curling Championships, where they finished in 4th place for the third time in her career.
Nielsen skipped the Danish women's team at the 2014 Winter Olympics, where she was also the flag bearer for Denmark in the opening ceremonies. At the games, she led the team to a 6th-place finish with a 4-5 record.

The Hazelwood Brewing Company is a historic former brewery in the Hazelwood neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The brewery opened in 1905 with a production capacity of 40,000 barrels per year and distributed its Bohemian, Pilsener, and Famous lagers throughout the region. During Prohibition, the company produced low-alcohol "near-beer," though it was raided several times for allegedly selling actual beer instead. After the end of Prohibition in 1933, the brewery was reorganized as the Hazelwood Beverage Company and then Derby Brewing Company. Derby Brewing went out of business in 1938, after which the brewery buildings were used for various purposes.
The main brewery building is constructed from brick and has three sections which consist of one, one, and four bays, respectively. The middle section has four stories plus a mezzanine, while the other two sections have three stories and a mezzanine. The southern section originally had a fourth story as well but it was destroyed by a tornado in 1998.
When built, the brewery also included an ice house, bottling building, and office. Part of the ice house is still standing but the other buildings were demolished.

Penrhyn railway station on the Ffestiniog Railway is located on a restricted site at Pen-y-Bwlch above the town of Penrhyndeudraeth (Penrhyndeudraeth means Headland between two beaches).
Beyond Penrhyn station, the railway crosses the A4085 Penrhyndeudraeth to Llanfrothen road on the line's only remaining gated and staffed level crossing. Because of the layout of the crossing, three privately owned terraced houses are between the two crossing gates.
History
The station opened on 6 January 1865 at the commencement of passenger services, and was rebuilt in 1879 using components from the original Porthmadog Harbour Station—externally it has changed little since. Originally called Penrhyndeudraeth, during the 1870s the name of was shortened to Penrhyn, in order to avoid confusion with the station on the Cambrian Railways coastline at the lower end of the town.
The station is at a height of 160 ft (50 m) and a distance of 3 miles 8 chains (5.0 km) from Porthmadog.
Penrhyn station closed to passenger traffic on 15 September 1939.
Restoration
The station was specially reopened on Monday 12 November 1956 when the General Manager of British Railways (Western Region) Mr. K. W. C. Grand visited the Ffestiniog Railway and travelled from Porthmadog Harbour by the first passenger train to Penrhyn since 1939. The public passenger service was resumed on 20 April 1957.
Penrhyn served as a temporary terminus until the line was re-opened to Tan-y-Bwlch in 1958, a run round loop being squeezed into the site for the purpose. The loop at Penrhyn continued in use as a passing loop for timetabled trains until 1974.
Much of the station building is now occupied by the volunteers hostel which was officially opened in 1972. Complete renovation by volunteers was followed on 3 May 1992 by an official re-opening.
Rhiw Goch
From 1975 Penrhyn was replaced for normal timetable purposes by a new passing loop at Rhiw Goch from Porthmadog. Although trains regularly stop for passing purposes, Rhiw Goch is not a passenger station, there is no public access and passengers are not permitted to alight there. However, tourist trains do on occasion terminate and reverse at Rhiw Goch.

The 2022 season is the Buffalo Bills' 53rd in the National Football League (NFL), their 63rd as a franchise and their eighth full season under the ownership of Terry and Kim Pegula, and their sixth under the head coach/general manager tandem of Sean McDermott and Brandon Beane.
The Bills will enter the 2022 season as back-to-back defending AFC East champions. They will attempt to improve upon their 11–6 record from last season and become the first team since the 2017 Eagles to win the Super Bowl for the first time.
2022 is the final season in the Bills' current lease on Highmark Stadium. Negotiations remain underway for the construction of a new stadium for the team as of January 2022; the team stated that it would not renew its lease on Highmark Stadium unless an agreement for a new stadium is struck by the end of the 2022 season.
With a 31–10 win over the defending Super Bowl champions, the Rams, and a 41–7 win over the Titans (both wins by a total of 55 points), which were two teams that combined for a winning percentage of .706 from the year before (since they shared the same pool of wins and losses, at 12–5), the Bills became the first team since the AFL-NFL merger to win their first two games by 55 points over two teams that combined for a winning percentage above .531 in the previous season.

Game summaries
Week 1: at Los Angeles Rams
NFL Kickoff Game
The Bills put on a show and destroyed the Super Bowl champion Rams on primetime television. Josh Allen had 4 total touchdowns while Matthew Stafford was held to just 1.
Week 2: vs. Tennessee Titans
Stefon Diggs had 3 touchdowns on Monday Night Football and the Bills thumped the defending #1 seed in the AFC Titans 41-7 after losing to them the last 2 seasons. The defense held the Titans to 187 yards of total offense and Matt Milano had an interception returned for a touchdown.
Week 3: at Miami Dolphins
The Bills sideline was in the sweltering sun while the home Dolphins were on the shaded side of Hard Rock Stadium, a major factor contributing to the Dolphins home field advantage. After trading touchdowns in the first half, the Bills had a 17–14 lead going into the fourth quarter, but Chase Edmonds scored his 2nd touchdown of the game to give the Dolphins a 21–17 lead. The Bills responded with an 8-minute drive, but on 4th and Goal from the 1-yard line, Josh Allen's pass fell incomplete and turned the ball over on downs. The Bills forced a Dolphins punt, but Thomas Morstead's kick hit Trent Sherfield in the buttocks and deflected backwards and out of the end zone for a safety to make the score 21–19. The play instantly became known as "The Butt Punt."
The Bills, only needing a field goal instead of a touchdown to win, got the ball back with no timeouts. With 18 seconds left, Allen avoided a sack and passed the ball to Isaiah McKenzie who tried to get out of bounds at the MIA-35 but was tackled just short of the sideline. The Bills hustled to get back to the line of scrimmage in time, but the clock hit all zeros and players on both teams collapsed in exhaustion. The Bills lost 21–19 in an instant classic, and fell to 2–1. The Dolphins became the only 3–0 team in the AFC.

Giulio Campi (1502 – 5 March 1572) was an Italian painter and architect. His brothers Vincenzo Campi and Antonio Campi were also renowned painters.
Biography
The eldest of a family prominent painters, Campi was born at Cremona. His father Galeazzo (1475–1536) taught him the first lessons in art.
In 1522, in Mantua, he studied painting, architecture, and modelling under Giulio Romano. He visited Rome, became an ardent student of the antique, and like Bernardino — distantly related to him — he combined a Lombard and Roman traditions. He collaborated on some works with Camillo Boccaccino, the son of Boccaccio Boccaccino, with whom Campi may also have received training.
Campi is called the "Ludovico Carracci of Cremona" for his influence, since Campi was as influential during the Renaissance in Cremona as the latter was on the Baroque school of Bologna. When he was just twenty-seven Giulio executed for the church of Sant'Abondio his masterpiece, a Virgin and Child with Sts Celsus and Nazarus, a decoration masterly in the freedom of its drawing and in the splendour of its color. His numerous paintings are grandly and reverently conceived, freely drawn, vigorously coloured, lofty in style, and broadly handled. He was animated in all his work by a deep piety. Many of his fresco works are housed in churches of Cremona, Mantua, Milan and in the church of Saint Margaret's, in his native town. Among his chief works are The Chess Game, Descent from the Cross in San Sigismondo at Cremona, and the frescoes in the dome of San Girolamo at Mantua. He was involved in the reconstruction and decoration of the church of Santa Rita in Cremona. An altar-piece in San Sigismondo and his Labours of Hercules were engraved by the celebrated Ghiso, il Mantovano.
He died in Cremona in 1572.

Love Under the Olive Tree is a Canadian television film directed by Peter DeLuise and written by Samantha Herman, with a story by Jenna Milly and Ann Marie Allison. The cast includes Tori Anderson, Benjamin Hollingsworth, and Shawn Roberts. It premiered on the Hallmark Channel on June 20, 2020.

Production
The movie was shot in British Columbia, Canada, in July and August 2019. One specific location was the Milsean Shoppe in Aldergrove, BC. It was originally scheduled to be released in September 2019 but the premiere was postponed. Love Under the Olive Tree explores two evolving relationships: one that is heterosexual, and the other one between a same-sex couple (Shawn Roberts and Andrew Dunbar). Roberts portrays Adam Caulfield, the lead character's gay best friend and her co-worker. According to the actor, the gay subplot was handled in the script in "the most natural and authentic way". Roberts went on to say: "I'd never seen that in any other scripts before. It wasn't a comment one way or another about anything, or what kind of relationships are out there, and without shining a light on things, just have something open and accepting."
Critical reception
In a journal for Fangirl, Interrupted the two lead characters were named "the Montagues and Capulets of the olive oil world", and the movie itself was praised for its inclusion of the LGBT characters. A review for The Best Darn Girls was mostly favorable: "While the conclusion is anticlimactic, the love story still has promise." Albert Nowicki of We'll Always Have the Movies praised the movie for its "charming setting" and "the natural portrayal of a queer relationship". He also believed Roberts' character was a positive gay role model and went on to describe him as a "Bruce Willis type of man", "with a musculature of a Superman".

The Treaty of Serbian–Albanian Alliance, also known as the Treaty of Niš, was a secret treaty signed in Niš between Essad Pasha Toptani and prime minister Nikola Pašić of Kingdom of Serbia on 17 September 1914.
Background
On 17 May 1914 Essad Pasha Toptani was accused of assisting the Peasant Revolt against William of Wied. He was exiled to Italy on 20 May without trial. In Italy, he was received with honor since both Italian and Austrian representatives played roles in intrigues that surrounded the revolt. Only a week after prince Wilhelm of Wied's departure from Durres on 3 September 1914, another violent revolt arose. The rebels managed to lay siege on Durres, imprison Wied's supporters, to call for Muslim prince and to establish the Senate for Central Albania.
The Treaty
In autumn 1914 Essad Pasha decided to accept the invitation of the Senate of Central Albania to return and lead them. First he travelled to Niš, Kingdom of Serbia, where he and Serbian prime minister Nikola Pašić signed the secret treaty of Serbian-Albanian alliance on 17 September 1914. The treaty was signed in Banovina building (which has been part of the University of Niš since 1966), which is close to Niš fortress.
The treaty had fifteen points which set up Serbian-Albanian political and military institutions and the military alliance of Albania and the Kingdom of Serbia. The treaty envisaged a rail-road to Durres, the financial and military support of the Kingdom of Serbia to Essad Pasha's position as Albanian ruler and it recorded the demarcation by a Serbo-Albanian commission. The treaty allowed Essad Pasha to change some clauses because the treaty would need the agreement of the Albanian National Assembly. This would be possible after Pasha was elected ruler. Serbia contracted to supply a military intervention to protect Pasha's rule and to subsidise his gendarmerie by paying 50,000 dinars per month for Albanian military supplies.
Aftermath
In October 1914 Essad Pasha returned to Albania. With Italian and Serbian financial backing he established armed forces in Dibër and captured the interior of Albania and Dures.

The activity selection problem is a combinatorial optimization problem concerning the selection of non-conflicting activities to perform within a given time frame, given a set of activities each marked by a start time (si) and finish time (fi). The problem is to select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person or machine, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time. The activity selection problem is also known as the Interval scheduling maximization problem (ISMP), which is a special type of the more general Interval Scheduling problem.
A classic application of this problem is in scheduling a room for multiple competing events, each having its own time requirements (start and end time), and many more arise within the framework of operations research.
Formal definition
Assume there exist n activities with each of them being represented by a start time si and finish time fi. Two activities i and j are said to be non-conflicting if si ≥ fj or sj ≥ fi. The activity selection problem consists in finding the maximal solution set (S) of non-conflicting activities, or more precisely there must exist no solution set S' such that |S'| > |S| in the case that multiple maximal solutions have equal sizes.
Optimal solution
The activity selection problem is notable in that using a greedy algorithm to find a solution will always result in an optimal solution. A pseudocode sketch of the iterative version of the algorithm and a proof of the optimality of its result are included below.
Algorithm
Greedy-Iterative-Activity-Selector(A, s, f):
Sort A by finish times stored in f
S = {A[1]}
k = 1
n = A.length
for i = 2 to n:
if s[i] ≥ f[k]:
S = S U {A[i]}
k = i
return S
Explanation
Line 1: This algorithm is called Greedy-Iterative-Activity-Selector, because it is first of all a greedy algorithm, and then it is iterative. There's also a recursive version of this greedy algorithm.
is an array containing the activities.
is an array containing the start times of the activities in .
is an array containing the finish times of the activities in .
Note that these arrays are indexed starting from 1 up to the length of the corresponding array.
Line 3: Sorts in increasing order of finish times the array of activities by using the finish times stored in the array . This operation can be done in time, using for example merge sort, heap sort, or quick sort algorithms.
Line 4: Creates a set to store the selected activities, and initialises it with the activity that has the earliest finish time.
Line 5: Creates a variable that keeps track of the index of the last selected activity.
Line 9: Starts iterating from the second element of that array up to its last element.
Lines 10,11: If the start time of the activity () is greater or equal to the finish time of the last selected activity (), then is compatible to the selected activities in the set , and thus it can be added to .
Line 12: The index of the last selected activity is updated to the just added activity .
Proof of optimality
Let be the set of activities ordered by finish time. Assume that is an optimal solution, also ordered by finish time; and that the index of the first activity in A is , i.e., this optimal solution does not start with the greedy choice. We will show that , which begins with the greedy choice (activity 1), is another optimal solution. Since , and the activities in A AGE disjoint by definition, the activities in B are also disjoint. Since B has the same number of activities as A, that is, , B is also optimal.
Once the greedy choice is made, the problem reduces to finding an optimal solution for the subproblem. If A is an optimal solution to the original problem S containing the greedy choice, then is an optimal solution to the activity-selection problem .
Why? If this were not the case, pick a solution B′ to S′ with more activities than A′ containing the greedy choice for S′. Then, adding 1 to B′ would yield a feasible solution B to S with more activities than A, contradicting the optimality.
Weighted activity selection problem
The generalized version of the activity selection problem involves selecting an optimal set of non-overlapping activities such that the total weight is maximized. Unlike the unweighted version, there is no greedy solution to the weighted activity selection problem. However, a dynamic programming solution can readily be formed using the following approach:
Consider an optimal solution containing activity . We now have non-overlapping activities on the left and right of . We can recursively find solutions for these two sets because of optimal sub-structure. As we don't know , we can try each of the activities. This approach leads to an solution. This can be optimized further considering that for each set of activities in , we can find the optimal solution if we had known the solution for , where is the last non-overlapping interval with in . This yields an solution. This can be further optimized considering the fact that we do not need to consider all ranges but instead just . The following algorithm thus yields an solution:
Weighted-Activity-Selection(S): // S = list of activities
sort S by finish time
opt[0] = 0 // opt[j] represents optimal solution (sum of weights of selected activities) for S[1,2..,j]
for i = 1 to n:
t = binary search to find activity with finish time <= start time for i
// if there are more than one such activities, choose the one with last finish time
opt[i] = MAX(opt[i-1], opt[t] + w(i))
return opt[n]

Spring Parade is a 1940 American musical comedy film directed by Henry Koster and starring Deanna Durbin. It is a remake of the 1934 film.
Plot
Based on a story by Ernst Marischka, the film is about a Hungarian woman who attends a Viennese fair and buys a card from a gypsy fortune teller which says she will meet someone important and is destined for a happy marriage. Soon after the woman gets a job as a baker's assistant and meets a handsome army drummer who dreams of becoming a famous composer and conductor, but is held back by the military which discourages original music. Wanting to help the army drummer, the woman sends one of his waltzes to the Austrian Emperor with his weekly order of pastries, which leads to the tuneful and joyous fulfillment of the gypsy's prediction.

Production
In January 1940 Universal announced Durbin's next film would be Spring Parade. Joe Pasternak called it "a musical of Old Vienna" that was similar to Blossom Time. It was a remake of a film Pasternak had made in 1934.
Cummings was cast in March 1940.
Filming took place from 27 May to August 1940.
Koster called it "a lovely picture" although he said Durbin "was getting a little more demanding" during filming. On one occasion they were filming after midnight and Durbin went home because she did not want to work that late. Koster threatened to quit the movie but the two made up.
Awards
The film was nominated for four Academy Awards.
Best Cinematography (Black-and-White) (Joseph Valentine)
Best Original Song (Robert Stolz and Gus Kahn, for "Waltzing in the Clouds")
Best Musical Score (Charles Previn)
Best Sound Recording (Bernard B. Brown)
Spring Parade received four Academy Award nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Original Song, Best Musical Score, and Best Sound Recording.

Joseph Firmenich (also spelt Josef Firmenich) (1821–1891) was a German painter. Firmenich was born in 1821 in Cologne and died in 1891 in Berlin. According to art historian Gustav Ebe, Firmenich was an autodidact who was a court painter in the Grand Duchy of Hesse, and painted natural landscapes from Tyrol and other regions. Other sources say that Firmenich was a student of Simon Meister. While visiting France, he once entered into a wager (worth a few champagne bottles and witnesses by artists) that German painters could paint more accurately than French painters. Firmenich painted an oak tree within an hour and won the challenge.

Tony Kelly (born 15 December 1993) is an Irish hurler who plays for Clare Senior Championship club Ballyea and at inter-county level with the Clare county hurling team.
Early life
Kelly attended St Flannan's College in Ennis for his secondary education and as of 2021 works in the school as a teacher as well as coaching the senior hurling team.
Playing career
Clare
Minor and under-21
Kelly first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Clare minor team in 2010. He won his first Munster medal that year following a 1-16 to 1-11 defeat of Waterford. Clare subsequently qualified for the All-Ireland decider against Kilkenny, however, Kelly's side faced a narrow 2-10 to 0-14 defeat.
In 2011 Kelly was appointed captain of the Clare minor team. He won a second consecutive Munster medal that year following a 1-20 to 3-9 defeat of Waterford once again. The subsequent All-Ireland semi final saw Clare defeated by Galway after extra time.
Kelly also became a member of the Clare under-21 team in 2011, however they were defeated in the Munster Semi-final by Limerick on a scoreline of 2-19 to 1-15 despite a contribution of 3 points from play from Tony Kelly. This remains Kelly's only defeat in the Munster Minor and Under-21 Championships. Kelly won his first Munster medal in that grade as Clare defeated Tipperary by 1-16 to 1-14 in the 2012 Munster Final in Cusack Park in Ennis. After trailing at half-time, Clare outscored Kilkenny by 1-10 to 0-4 in the second period of play to secure a 2-17 to 2-11 victory in the All-Ireland final of the same year. It was Kelly's first All-Ireland medal in the grade.
Clare dominated the under-21 series once again in 2013. A 1-17 to 2-10 defeat of Tipperary in the provincial decider gave Kelly a second Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland saw Clare face first-time finalists Antrim. In a complete mismatch, Clare powered to a 2-28 to 0-12 victory, with Kelly collecting a second consecutive All-Ireland medal.
Senior
Kelly made his senior championship debut at left wing-forward and scoring 1-2 in a 1-16 to 0-16 defeat of Dublin on 7 July 2012.
On 8 September 2013 Kelly lined out against Cork in his first All-Ireland final. Three second-half goals through Conor Lehane, Anthony Nash and Pa Cronin, and a tenth point of the game from Patrick Horgan gave Cork a one-point lead as injury time came to an end. A last-gasp point from corner-back Domhnall O'Donovan earned Clare a 0-25 to 3-16 draw. The replay on 28 September was regarded as one of the best in recent years. Clare's Shane O'Donnell was a late addition to the team, and went on to score a hat-trick of goals in the first nineteen minutes of the game. Horgan top scored for Cork, however, further goals from Conor McGrath and Darach Honan secured a 5-16 to 3-16 victory for Clare. It was Kelly's first All-Ireland medal. He rounded off the season by collecting his first All-Star award, while also becoming the only player in the history of the scheme to have won the Hurler and Young Hurler of the Year awards in the same year.
In June 2014, Kelly featured in the Sky Sports television advert to promote their new broadcasting deal with the GAA.
On 8 May 2016, Clare won the 2016 National Hurling League, their first National Hurling League title since 1978 after a 1-23 to 2-19 win against Waterford in a replay. Kelly scored 1-6 in the game, including two late points to win the game.
On 25 October 2020, Kelly scored 17 points in the first game of the delayed Munster Championship against Limerick, in a game that Clare lost 1-23 to 0-36.
On 7 November 2020, he scored 0-13 against Laois in round 1 of the qualifiers, and a week later scored 1-15 against Wexford in round 2.

Zvi Kolitz (; December 14, 1912 – September 29, 2002) was a Lithuanian-born Jewish film and theatrical producer and a writer whose short story Yosl Rakover Talks to God became a classic of Holocaust literature.
Life
Zvi Kolitz, a son of a prominent rabbinical family, was born in Alytus, Lithuania. He studied at the nearby Yeshiva of Slobodka and then lived for several years in Italy, where he attended the University of Florence and the Naval Academy at Civitavecchia. He emigrated to Palestine before the 1947–1949 Palestine war and led recruiting efforts for the Zionist Revisionist movement. He was arrested by the British and jailed for his political activities. After Israel's independence in 1948, Kolitz became active in the state's literary and cultural life. In 2002, Kolitz died of natural causes in New York, NY.
Yosl Rakover Talks to God
Kolitz is best known for Yosl Rakover Talks to God, a short story he wrote in 1946 for a Jewish newspaper in Buenos Aires. In the story, set in the final days of the Warsaw Ghetto, a pious Jew challenges God. And so, my God, before I die, freed from all fear, beyond all terror, in a state of absolute inner peace and trust, I will allow myself to call you to account one last time in my life, the fictionalized Rakover says, adding later I believe in the God of Israel, even when he has done everything to make me cease to believe in him.
A few years after it was published, the story was translated into English and Hebrew but without Kolitz's name as the author. It was passed on as an authentic testimony of the Warsaw Ghetto and ended up in several Holocaust anthologies and even as a meditation in Jewish prayer books.
It was many years before Kolitz was able to recapture his story and claim it as his own. It was later translated under his name in editions in Polish, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Danish and Swedish. In 1999, Pantheon Books published the story in a slim volume with afterwords by Paul Badde, Emmanuel Levinas and Leon Wieseltier. Dr. Levinas called it a text both beautiful and true, true as only fiction can be.
Other works
While living in Israel in the early 1950s, Kolitz was a co-writer and co-producer of Hill 24 Doesn't Answer (1954), a 1947–1949 Palestine war movie, which was Israel's first full-length motion picture. He later moved to the United States and was co-producer of Rolf Hochhuth's The Deputy, one of the first plays to challenge the Vatican's silence during the Holocaust, which ran on Broadway, amid considerable controversy, for nine months in 1964.
Kolitz was co-producer of several other Broadway shows, including The Megilla of Itzik Manger (1968), and a musical, I'm Solomon, an expensive flop that ran for seven performances in 1968.
Kolitz also wrote several works of fiction and Jewish philosophy, including The Tiger Beneath the Skin: Stories and Parables of the Years of Death (Creative Age Press, 1947), Survival for What? (The Philosophical Library, 1969), The Teacher: An Existential Approach to the Bible (Jason Aronson, 1982) and Confrontation: The Existential Thought of Rabbi J. B. Soloveitchik (Ktav, 1993).
Until a few weeks before his death, Kolitz wrote a weekly column for the Yiddish newspaper Algemeiner Journal. The column appeared under his name for 32 years. He also taught courses in Jewish thought for many years at Yeshiva University.

The 1975–76 BBC2 Floodlit Trophy was the eleventh occasion on which the BBC2 Floodlit Trophy competition had been held.
St. Helens won the trophy by beating Dewsbury by the score of 22-2
The match was played at Knowsley Road, Eccleston, St Helens, Merseyside. The attendance was 3,858, and the receipts were £1,747
Background
This season saw no changes in the entrants, no new members and no withdrawals, the number remaining at twenty-two.
The format was again changed slightly, in that the preliminary round as well as the remainder of the tournament was played on a knock-out basis.
The preliminary round now involved twelve clubs, to reduce the numbers taking part in the competition proper to just sixteen.

Notes and comments
1 * Dewsbury, who joined the competition in season 1973–74, win their first game in the competition
2 * This match was televised
3 * The Rothmans Rugby League Yearbook 1990-1991 and 1991-92 and the RUGBYLEAGUEprojects gives the attendance as 3,858 but theofficial St. Helens archives give it as 3,850
4 * Knowsley Road was the home of St Helens R.F.C. from 1890 until its closure in 2010. The final capacity was 17,500 although the record attendance was 35,695 set on 26 December 1949 for a league game between St Helens and Wigan.
General information for those unfamiliar
The Rugby League BBC2 Floodlit Trophy was a knock-out competition sponsored by the BBC and between rugby league clubs, entrance to which was conditional upon the club having floodlights. Most matches were played on an evening, and those of which the second half was televised, were played on a Tuesday evening.
Despite the competition being named as 'Floodlit', many matches took place during the afternoons and not under floodlights, and several of the entrants, including Barrow and Bramley did not have adequate lighting. And, when in 1973, due to the world oil crisis, the government restricted the use of floodlights in sport, all the matches, including the Trophy final, had to be played in the afternoon rather than at night.
The Rugby League season always (until the onset of "Summer Rugby" in 1996) ran from around August-time through to around May-time and this competition always took place early in the season, in the Autumn, with the final taking place in December (The only exception to this was when disruption of the fixture list was caused by inclement weather)

Martinus Joseph Hubertus Cobbenhagen (Gulpen, 10 September 1893 - Tilburg, 10 February 1954) was a Dutch Roman Catholic priest, economist, professor of economics and rector of Tilburg University. Son of Johannes Franciscus Hubertus Cobbenhagen, candle maker, and Maria Catharina Hubertina Ramaekers.
Life
Cobbenhagen studied at the minor seminary (1906-1913), and at the major seminary (1913-1916 ) in Rolduc. He was ordained a priest in 1917, and continued his studies at the College of Business in Rotterdam (, today the Erasmus University Rotterdam), where he completed his master's in economics (1921). After his graduation he was invited as instructor in Rolduc, where he gave classes in business and religion. In 1927 Cobbenhagen defended his PhD in Economics under the supervision of . His doctoral dissertation was titled The responsibility in commercial enterprise ().
Cobbenhagen was one of the founders of the Catholic College of Economics () in 1927, the predecessor of Tilburg University. From 1929 to 1954 he was Professor of General Theory and History of Economics, and during this period he was elected Rector Magnificus of the same university for three times (1932 – 1933; 1937 – 1938; 1945 – 1946).
From 1935 until his death (1954) he was the editor of Economie, a journal of Tilburg economists having the mission of providing a space for contributions on issues of socio-economic planning.
From July 1942 to April 1943 Cobbenhagen was interned in Haaren with other fellow-professors because of a satirical poem written by Frans van der Ven against Anton Mussert, leader of the NSB party.
In 1947 he was appointed Secret Papal Chamberlain.
Ideas
Academic contributions
Cobbenhagen's academic contributions do not include books but his dissertation. He wrote several manuscripts, classes and book reviews, which were later collected under the title The academic community in Tilburg. Collected essays and talks on academic practice, higher education in economics and the academic lifestyle () and published in 1945. These writings constitute the bulk of Cobbenhagen's academic production in economics, including economic doctrines concerning planning, price and wealth distribution.
Educational project
Cobbenhagen's views on economics were inspired on his knowledge and practice of Catholic moral theology. He was the first in the Netherlands to introduce the idea that ethics and economics are not distinct fields of knowledge. In his educational project, the academic curriculum of economists would combine a solid academic basis with the application of academic knowledge to the practice of socioeconomic life. He proposed an interdisciplinary approach in which the study of economics curriculum included also courses in ethics, philosophy, psychology, and other social sciences. He promoted several academic initiatives to provide students with intellectual stimuli, and for his dedication to the administration of the College and his personal involvement in student life he merited the nickname of father of the college community.
Economic thinking
One of the principles of Cobbenhagen's economic thinking was that the economy is inherently linked to sociology and psychology. He believed that an economic science isolated from the rest of human knowledge contributed to human materialism and mechanization of life. A second important point was his philosophical and ethical treatment of economic issues, inspired by Catholic moral theology.
The economy was, according to Cobbenhagen, at the crossroad between natural science and the humanities; as such, it should combine quantitative with qualitative elements. In his views the positivist analysis of economic factors (considered quantitatively as measurable entities interacting in a closed system governed by functional relationships) was only one-sided. A comprehensive economic analysis should drive to insights into the essence of things and to assess effectiveness.
Thus a price doctrine explains the how price forms and how the equilibrium price originates, but also the why of price formation and equilibrium, and their effectiveness in practice.
According to this practical criterion to evaluate comparative efficiency, Cobbenhagen saw the immediate and material economic prosperity of society as goals in light of a higher ultimate end, which to him was religious. This idea also opened the way to the development of evaluation theories in economic regulation and economic policy.
Philosophical view
Cobbenhagen's treatment of economic issues was rooted in the philosophical realm of neo-Thomism. According to Cobbenhagen, this approach was normative, and explicitly did not undermine the hardcore of theoretical economics.
Accordingly, economics is a science which possesses the economy as its own formal object, that is the study of human behavior aimed at the welfare purpose, which is different from the formal object of ethics as a normative science. In his view, economics could be fully understood in its essence only when studied adopting a philosophical stand, combined with its quantitative and qualitative study.
Relationship with Catholic social thought
During the interwar period Cobbenhagen worked with other intellectuals, such as prof. J. A. Veraart, Mgr. prof. F. A. Weve, prof. H. A. Kaag and prof. C. P. M. Romme, which shared with him the same Catholic socio-economic ideas.
Similar ideas were also the teaching of the Jesuit priest and economist Heinrich Pesch (1854-1926) and are also contained in the papal encyclical letter Quadragesimo anno (1931).
Cobbenhagen and his fellow intellectuals advocated solidarism as a socio economic planning principle to overcome both individualist capitalism and state socialism, and a view of society as a community having an organic and hierarchical order and organized according to the principle of subsidiarity.

Edmund Henry Lacon Willes (7 July 1832 – 9 September 1896) was an English first-class cricketer who played in the 1850s and 1860s as a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm roundarm fast. He became a Church of England cleric.
Willes was educated at Winchester College, where he represented the college cricket team, and at Oxford University, where he was an exhibitioner at Queen's College from 1850 to 1853, a scholar from 1854 to 1856 and a fellow from 1856 to 1865.
Cricket career
Willes played cricket for a variety of amateur teams over a period of 17 years. He made his first-class debut for a Hampshire team against an All-England Eleven in 1850. Between 1851 and 1854, he played for Oxford University, appearing three times in the University Match against Cambridge. He also appeared for amateur sides representing Kent between 1851 and 1855 and in one of these, a match between the Gentlemen of Kent and the Gentlemen of England in 1851, he scored 69, which was his highest first-class score. The following year, 1852, he took four Marylebone Cricket Club wickets in an innings for Oxford, though his precise figures are not recorded; this was the only time he took four wickets in an innings.
Ten years after his previous first-class appearance, Willes made his debut for Hampshire County Cricket Club against Middlesex in 1865, and he then played in two further games for MCC, one in each of the next two seasons. In Willes' overall first-class career he scored 416 runs at a batting average of 13.86; with the ball he took 20 wickets, though incomplete figures for several matches mean his average is not known.
Clerical career
Willes was an assistant master at Winchester College from 1860 to 1865 and rector of St Swithin's Church, Winchester from 1863 to 1865. He was then successively vicar at Helston, Cornwall and Ashby Magna in Leicestershire before being appointed rector of Monk Sherborne, Hampshire in 1887. From 1871 he was an honorary canon of Peterborough. He died at Monk Sherborne on 9 September 1896.
Family
Willes was the third surviving son of George Wickens Willes, a Captain in the Royal Navy, by his wife Anne Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edmund Lacon, 1st Baronet. His elder brother was Admiral George Ommanney Willes, Royal Navy Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth.
Willes' distant cousin George Willes represented Cambridge University in five first-class matches.

PT Indosat Tbk, trading as Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison, is a telecommunications provider in Indonesia which is owned by Ooredoo Hutchison Asia, a joint venture between Ooredoo and Hutchison Asia Telecom Group (a part of CK Hutchison Holdings) since 2022. The company offers wireless services for mobile phones, and to a lesser extent, broadband internet lines for homes. Indosat operates their wireless services under two brands: IM3 and Three (3). These brands differ by their payment model (pre-paid vs. post-paid) as well as pricing. Indosat also provides other services such as IDD, fixed telecommunications, and multimedia.
In February 2013, Qtel, a majority stakeholder in Indosat, rebranded itself as Ooredoo. This was followed by a renaming of all their subsidiaries across multiple countries. As such, Indosat was renamed Indosat Ooredoo on November 19, 2015.
, Indosat had 58 million subscribers. This is a sharp decrease from 2017, where the number was reported as 110 million. The market share was 16.5%, making them the second largest mobile network operator in the country.
History
1967
Indosat was established as the first foreign investment company in Indonesia that provides international telecommunication services using an international satellite. It was owned by American conglomerate company ITT until 1980.
1980
Indosat expanded into becoming the first international company that was acquired and 100% owned by the Indonesian Government.
1994–2003
Indosat acquired Satelindo and SLI through share majority. They also established PT Indosat Multimedia Mobile (IM3) to provide and operate a nationwide GPRS network, a first for the country. In 2003, Indosat merged with its 3 subsidiaries—Satelindo, IM3, and Bimagraha—and established itself as a mobile network operator.
2003–2009
Indosat was granted a 3G network license and introduced a 3.5G service in Jakarta and Surabaya. In 2009, Qtel bought 24.19% of series B shares from the public and became Indosat's majority shareholder with a 65% ownership. They were granted the use of additional 3G frequencies later that same year. Indosat also won the WiMAX bid from the government during this period.
2012–2020
In 2014, Indosat launched and commercialized a 4G service at 900 MHz, with a download speed of up to 42 Mbit/s. The service was first rolled out in the major cities, with planned expansions to rural areas. In November 2015, Indosat rebranded itself as Indosat Ooredoo. In 2016, Indosat teamed up with Swedish based music streaming service Spotify to become the first operator to offer Spotify music services in Indonesia.
2021–present
In January 2021, Indosat announced that it will exit the satellite business. In September 2021, Indosat has announced that the latter company would be merged with Hutchison Asia Telecom Group/Garibaldi Thohir's joint venture PT Hutchison 3 Indonesia (who operates 3-branded networks in Indonesia) to form Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison. The merger was closed on 4 January 2022.
Subsidiaries
Current
Lintasarta is an Indonesian company serving as provider of data communication. The company is majority owned by Indosat Ooredoo, while the remaining shares are owned by several institutions such as foundations and cooperatives.

The Bottle Conjuror was the stage name given to an anonymous theatrical performer, advertised to appear at the Haymarket Theatre in England, on 16 January 1749. While on stage, the acrobat was to have placed his body inside an empty wine bottle, in full view of the audience. Following a non-appearance, the audience rioted and gutted the theatre.
History
Background
Although the identity of the hoax's perpetrator is unknown, several authors consider John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu, to have been responsible. While in the company of other noblemen, the Duke was reported to have made a bet that, with an advertisement claiming that a man could "creep into a quart bottle", he could fill a theatre. The event was advertised in several London newspapers and was soon the talk of the town.
Performance
In front of a huge audience, which included the king's second son, the Duke of Cumberland, the theatre lights were brought up at about 7 pm. With no music to keep them entertained, the crowd grew restless and began to voice their discontent. A theatre employee appeared from behind the curtain and told the audience that, if the performer did not appear, their money would be refunded. One member of the audience reportedly shouted that if the audience paid double, the conjurer would fit himself into a pint bottle.
As the crowd grew more restless, someone threw a lighted candle onto the stage. Most of the audience—including the Duke—took this as their cue to leave, some "losing a cloak, others a hat, others a wig, and swords also". A group of angry spectators stayed inside and gutted the theatre. Benches were ripped up, scenery was destroyed and boxes were demolished. Debris was dragged into the street and burnt on a bonfire.
Aftermath
Suspicion immediately fell upon the theatre's manager, Samuel Foote, for having originated the hoax. Foote claimed he knew nothing about the performance, but that he had warned the theatre's owner, John Potter, that he suspected something was not quite correct. Potter himself fell under suspicion, but was apparently innocent, "a strange man" having dealt with all the arrangements that night.
The "Man in the Bottle" instantly became the target of the newspapers and pamphlets, who published cutting satires about the conjurer's non-appearance, and its consequences. Many satirical prints were produced, among them two caricatures published within the month: The Bottle-Conjuror from Head to Foot, without equivocation, and English Credulity; or ye're all bottled. One newspaper explained the non-appearance of the conjurer by claiming that he had been ready to perform on the night, but was asked for a private audience beforehand; whereupon receiving a demonstration of the trick, the viewer had "corked up the bottle, whipped it in his pocket and made off."

Henry's Hamburgers is a former American fast-food restaurant chain of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Only one franchise store remains today.
History
In 1954 the Bresler's Ice Cream Company decided to expand into the growing fast-food drive-in industry. Company executives were looking for a new outlet to promote higher sales of their malts and shakes without altering their existing ice cream shop franchises. Under the name Henry's Hamburgers, many franchises were eventually established. The name Henry was chosen to honor the memory of the late Henry Bresler, one of the brothers who had founded the ice cream company.
Henry's was modelled after James Collin's Hamburger Handout restaurants in Southern California which in turn had been modelled after the McDonald brother's San Bernardino operation. They were both a Chicago area competitor and copy of McDonald's.
Growth
Just two years later, by 1956, Henry's Hamburgers had thirty-five locations in the Chicago area. At the time that outnumbered some of the industry's current giants, such as McDonald's. By the early 1960s there were over two hundred Henry's restaurants across America with operations headquarters in Chicago. Henry's used the advertising slogans "Aren't you hungry for a Henry's?" and "Head for Henry's", and offered burgers for as low as 15 cents or "ten burgers for a buck".
Decline
Although the reasons remain mostly unclear, by the mid-1970s Henry's Hamburger locations were closing at a fast rate.
Mergers and ownership changes within the Bresler company no doubt played a large role. Among other reasons could be a failure to add popular features like drive-thru pickup, diversifying of menu items like competitors, and massive national advertising campaigns by McDonald's, Burger King and other competitors. The only remaining location is in Benton Harbor, Michigan.

The International Generic Sample Number or IGSN is a persistent identifier for sample. As an active persistent identifier it can be resolved through the Handle System. The system is used in production by the System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR), Geoscience Australia, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Mineral Resources, Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC), University of Bremen MARUM, German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ), IFREMER Institut Français de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer, Korea Institute of Geoscience & Mineral Resources (KIGAM), and University of Kiel. Other organisations are preparing the introduction of the IGSN.
The IGSN was developed as the International Geo Sample Number to provide a persistent, globally unique, web resolvable identifier for physical samples. IGSN is both a governance and technical system for assigning globally unique persistent identifiers to physical samples. Even though initially developed for samples in the geosciences, the application of IGSN can be and has already been expanded to other domains that rely on physical samples and collections. To take into account the expanded scope of the application of IGSN beyond the earth and environmental sciences, the IGSN Implementation Organization (IGSN e.V.) voted to change the name of the identifier to International Generic Sample Number (IGSN) and rename the organisation accordingly.
The IGSN preserves the identity of a sample even as it is moved from lab to lab and as data appear in different publications, thus eliminating ambiguity that stems from similar names for samples from the earth. The IGSN unique identifier allows researchers to track the analytical history of a sample and build on previously collected data as new techniques are developed. Additionally, the IGSN provides a link between disparate data generated by different investigators and published in different scientific articles.
In September 2021, the members of IGSN e.V. and DataCite agreed to enter a partnership. Under the partnership, DataCite will provide the IGSN ID registration services and supporting technology to enable the ongoing sustainability of the IGSN PID infrastructure. The IGSN e.V. will facilitate a Community of Communities to promote and support new research and innovation for standard methods of identifying, citing, and locating physical samples.
History
The IGSN was developed as part of SESAR with the support of the National Science Foundation at the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory. The project was initiated and managed by the Geoinformatics for Geochemistry Program under the direction of Kerstin Lehnert to address data curation obstacles such as different samples that share the same name, and samples that are renamed as they move between laboratories and thus generating analyses that are published under different aliases. As a result, metadata that ensure unique identification are often missing and this causes irritation for future reuse of data from a sample or the sample itself. Sample databases, such as the SESAR database, are designed to address these issues.
At a workshop hosted at the San Diego Supercomputer Center in 2011, a group of experts met to discuss how to transition the IGSN project into a sustainable infrastructure. The group recommended opening the system to other IGSN registration agents, making it international and transferring the operation and governance of the IGSN to an independent body. This recommendation led to the foundation of the International Geo Sample Implementation Organization e.V. (IGSN e.V.) and the founding event was held at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting 2011 in San Francisco, California. The IGSN e.V. is an incorporated organisation under German law and is registered at the Magistrates Court in Potsdam, Germany.
Membership in the organisation is open only to institutions, not to individuals. At present, IGSN e.V. has 16 full members.
In 2018, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation awarded Columbia University's Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory a grant for a project to modernise the IGSN business model and system architecture. The funding from the Sloan Foundation will support a series of workshops, at which international experts will come together to redesign the IGSN system and its management to allow researchers world-wide use the IGSN with confidence.
In September 2021, IGSN e.V. and DataCite entered a partnership under which DataCite will provide the IGSN ID registration services and supporting technology to enable the ongoing sustainability of the IGSN PID infrastructure. The IGSN e.V. will facilitate a Community of Communities to promote and support new research and innovation for standard methods of identifying, citing, and locating physical samples. The partnership allows IGSN to leverage DataCite DOI registration services and to focus community efforts on advocacy and expanding the global samples ecosystem.
IGSN and DataCite have a common purpose, and a close relationship in the future will provide mutual benefit to our shared vision of connecting research and identifying knowledge. The partnership brings years of experience across our organizations and communities to scale sample community engagement, develop sample identifier practice standards, and increase adoption globally.

An example of a publication using live IGSNs can be found here:
Dere, A. L., T. S. White, R. H. April, B. Reynolds, T. E. Miller, E. P. Knapp, L. D. McKay, and S. L. Brantley (2013), Climate dependence of feldspar weathering in shale soils along a latitudinal gradient, Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, 122, 101–126, https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2013.08.001.
This paper contains several samples identified by IGSN, one of them is IGSN: SSH000SUA. Information about this sample can be obtained by resolving the IGSN by adding the URL of the resolver before the IGSN: http://igsn.org/SSH000SUA. Since IGSN and Digital Object Identifier are technically Handles, the example IGSN can also be resolved through http://hdl.handle.net/10273/SSH000SUA or https://doi.org/10273/SSH000SUA.
IGSN can be used to identify samples and sampling features, such as boreholes or outcrops. The IGSN ICDP5054ESYI201 identifies a core section from core 5054_1_A_658_Z (IGSN ICDP5054ECYD101) of the COSC Expedition of the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program. The corresponding drill hole (sampling feature) 5054_1_A is identified by IGSN ICDP5054EEW1001.

Banda is an unincorporated rural community in Dufferin County, Ontario, Canada.
Officially located in Mulmur Township, Banda has historically been associated with both Mulmur Township and Nottawasaga Township (now Clearview Township), because it is located on the boundary between both townships.
History
Duff Lott and his grandson John were early settlers, arriving in the spring of 1845. A log schoolhouse, S.S. No. 6, was built in 1857, and a post office opened in 1860. The name "Banda" was selected by the first postmaster, John Clemenger, after looking at a map of the East Indies where the Banda Islands and Banda Sea are located. That same year, the population of Banda had reached 50. During the 1860s, Banda was noted as having a wagon shop, shoemaker, blacksmith, carpenter, cabinetmaker, and stores.
Christ Church Banda was established north of the settlement in 1865. The extant church and cemetery are today called Banda Anglican Christ Church. Banda Methodist Church (also called Baker's Church) was established west of the settlement in 1867, and in 1869, John Clemenger donated land for a cemetery there. The church closed in 1897 and has been removed, though the cemetery remains. Prior to the 1890s, a presbyterian church was also established.
Banda became known in the region for its cattle fairs, which began in the 1860s.
Orange Lodge 426 established in Banda around 1870. The lodge had a fife-and-drum band.
The Wilcox Inn, owned and operated by Joseph Wilcox, opened in Banda during the 1880s. The hotel later moved to Stayner.
By 1890, Banda was receiving daily mail, and a stagecoach stopped daily. The cost of the stagecoach was 25 cents.
The settlement was described in 1908 as a "good dairying and fruit district", when its population had decreased to 30.
The post office closed in 1915, and the school closed in 1965.
Banda was described in 1977 as "a tiny crossroads community".

Nicholas Goldschmidt, (December 6, 1908 – February 8, 2004) was a Canadian conductor, administrator, teacher, performer, music festival entrepreneur and artistic director. He was the grand-nephew of famed composer Adalbert von Goldschmidt (1848-1906).
In 1937, Goldschmidt immigrated to the US, where he served as director of opera at the San Francisco Conservatory and Stanford University from 1938 to 1942. He was director of the opera department at Columbia University from 1942 to 1944. He subsequently moved to Toronto, where he served as the first music director of the Royal Conservatory Opera School (University of Toronto Opera Division) from 1946 to 1957. In 1950, Goldschmidt, Arnold Walter and Herman Geiger-Torel helped to found the Royal Conservatory Opera Company, which later became the Canadian Opera Company. From 1949 to 1957, Goldschmidt was the first music director of the CBC Opera.
In 1978, Goldschmidt was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, and was promoted to Companion in 1989. In 1997, Goldschmidt received the Governor General's Performing Arts Award, Canada's highest honour in the performing arts.
Goldschmidt married Shelagh Fraser on 26 June 1948.

Kenneth Biros (June 24, 1958 – December 8, 2009) was an American convicted murderer who was sentenced to death and executed for the aggravated murder, attempted rape, aggravated robbery and felonious sexual penetration of a young woman. Biros was the first condemned person to be executed by lethal injection in the United States with the use of a single drug, setting a Guinness World Record.
Murder
Biros admitted to killing 22-year-old Tami Engstrom during February 1991 in a fit of rage. Biros then cut up the body and spread numerous parts over a wide territory encompassing portions of northeast Ohio and northwest Pennsylvania.
Conviction
Biros was convicted of aggravated murder, attempted rape, aggravated robbery and felonious sexual penetration and sentenced to death. He was originally sentenced to die by means of lethal injection at 10:00a.m. on March 20, 2007. This would have been the first execution during Governor Ted Strickland's administration. Governor Strickland denied Biros clemency on March 16, 2007. However, on that day the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the ruling of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Biros' execution should be stayed to allow him to continue to argue his case that Ohio's lethal injection is cruel and unusual punishment. He was then transferred from Ohio's death row at the Ohio State Penitentiary in Mansfield to the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville. On April 24, 2009, Trumbull County Prosecutor Dennis Watkins requested the Ohio Supreme Court to set an execution date after a federal judge decided on Tuesday, April 21, 2009, that Ohio's execution method was flawed, but not unconstitutional. The Supreme Court of Ohio later set a new execution date for December 8, 2009.
Execution
Biros was executed by lethal injection on December 8, 2009, at 11:00a.m. at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville, Ohio. His execution was originally scheduled for 10:00a.m., but was later delayed until 11:00a.m. He was pronounced dead at 11:47a.m. Biros was the first condemned person to be executed with a lethal single-drug dose of an anesthetic, sodium thiopental, in America.

Jiangsu University () is a highly ranked and prestigious doctoral research university located in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China (PRC). It is a National Key University jointly developed by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Chinese Ministry of Education, and The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People's Republic of China.
History and overview
Jiangsu University was established through the combination of Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Zhenjiang Medical College and Zhenjiang Teachers' College, under the permission of the Chinese Ministry of Education in August, 2001. Its main institution was the former Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, which was one of the 88 key universities designated by the State Council in 1978. Its history began with Sanjiang Normal School founded in 1902, which evolved and renamed Liangjiang Normal School in 1906, Nanjing Higher Normal School in 1915, National Southeastern University in 1921, Disi Zhongshan University in 1927, Jiangsu University in February and Central University in March 1928, and Nanjing University in 1949. Nanjing University Engineering College became Nanjing Polytechnic Institute in 1952 and then in 1960 a part of it became independent and moved to Zhenjiang next year and later became Jiangsu University of Science and Technology. It renamed Jiangsu University when merged with two colleges in the same city in 2001.
Jiangsu University (JSU) was founded in 1902 as a part of Sanjiang Normal University. It was retitled as Jiangsu University by integrating Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Zhenjiang Medical College and Zhenjiang Teachers' College with the approval of the Ministry of Education of China in August, 2001. The university's undergraduate teaching was graded excellent by the Ministry of Education in 2004. It has developed to be a national comprehensive key university. According to the Evaluations of China's Universities in 2017, 2016 and 2015 by China Academy of Management Science, JSU is ranked 41, 48 and 55, respectively. It is committed to cultivating talents with 4C (Confidence, Communication, Cooperation and Creation). Now the university is launching the new orientation of schooling for high-level, research-oriented university with strength of engineering and strategy of internationalization.
JSU offers 88 undergraduate programs, 170 master programs, and 42 PhD programs in 10 academic fields: Engineering, Science, Management, Economics, Medicine, Law, Education, Literature and History. The university has 13 post-doctoral research stations. Distinguished among its peers for its academic rigor, the 24 schools are competing and collaborating with each other for a high-level, research-oriented university with distinctive features and internationalization strategy.
JSU has 5,763 staff members (including those of Affiliated Hospital). 2,475 are faculty members, including 450 professors. 54% of them have got Ph.D degrees and over 24% have experience of overseas study. The current total enrollment of full-time students amounts to over 33,000, including 10,000 postgraduates, 842 international students from 74 countries. Jingjiang College of Jiangsu University has an enrollment of about 10,000 full-time students.
JSU has been promoting high-level research. In the recent 5 years, the total scientific research fund amounts to 25 billion RMB, sponsored by the governments and enterprises. The authorized patents in 2014 ranked 12 and in 2015 ranked 6 among China's universities. Five disciplines have been ranked as top 1% in ESI, such as Engineering, Clinical Medicine, Materials Science, Chemistry, and Agriculture Science. Drawing on the big varieties of programs and multi-disciplinary strengths, we operate an array of research institutes and centers serving as both the academic think tanks and technological innovation source at the national and regional levels.
JSU gives priorities to the internationalization of the schooling, encouraging faculty members and students to go abroad for further studies, inviting more global talents to join us for mutual benefits, promoting international research collaboration as well as recruiting more overseas students.
JSU has signed institutional cooperation agreements with 87 universities in 30 countries and regions by June 2015. The Confucius Institute co-built by JSU and Graz University (Austria) has been operating smoothly since October 2010, followed by the opening of the collaborative Chinese-German Language and Culture Center.
