Demographic information on these borrowers is sketchy. But at least one study indicates that 18 percent of the loans in the subprime market went to black borrowers, compared to 5 per cent of loans in the conventional loan market.
In moving, even tentatively, into this new area of lending, Fannie Mae is taking on significantly more risk, which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times. But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980's.
''From the perspective of many people, including me, this is another thrift industry growing up around us,'' said Peter Wallison a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. ''If they fail, the government will have to step up and bail them out the way it stepped up and bailed out the thrift industry.''
Under Fannie Mae's pilot program, consumers who qualify can secure a mortgage with an interest rate one percentage point above that of a conventional, 30-year fixed rate mortgage of less than $240,000 -- a rate that currently averages about 7.76 per cent. If the borrower makes their or their monthly payments on time for two years, the one percentage point premium is dropped.

Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, does not lend money directly to consumers. Instead, it purchases loans that banks make on what is called the secondary market. By expanding the type of loans that it will buy, Fannie Mae is hoping to spur banks to make more loans to people with less-than-stellar credit ratings.
Fannie Mae officials stress that the new mortgages will be extended to all potential borrowers who can qualify for a mortgage. But they add that the move is intended in part to increase the number of minority and low income homeowners who tend to have worse credit ratings than non-Hispanic whites.
Home ownership has, in fact, exploded among minorities during the economic boom of the 1990's. The number of mortgages extended to Hispanic applicants jumped by 87.2 per cent from 1993 to 1998, according to Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies. During that same period the number of African Americans who got mortgages to buy a home increased by 71.9 per cent and the number of Asian Americans by 46.3 per cent.
In contrast, the number of non-Hispanic whites who received loans for homes increased by 31.2 per cent.

Despite these gains, home ownership rates for minorities continue to lag behind non-Hispanic whites, in part because blacks and Hispanics in particular tend to have on average worse credit ratings.
In July, the Department of Housing and Urban Development proposed that by the year 2001, 50 percent of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's portfolio be made up of loans to low and moderate-income borrowers. Last year, 44 percent of the loans Fannie Mae purchased were from these groups.
The change in policy also comes at the same time that HUD is investigating allegations of racial discrimination in the automated underwriting systems used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to determine the credit-worthiness of credit applicants.
HARINGEY police have seized nine stolen mototorcyles in a lock-up, despite initially being uninterested in the case.
When Sam Jackson had their R6 stolen from outside their house in Enfield, they alerted the local police and told them their Acutrac device could pin-point where the motorcycle was. The police didn't take any action and later that day Jackson could see the bike on the move again.
Frustrated with a lack of action, Jackson told their story to local newspaper Enfield Independent who ran an article highlighting their plight. Haringey Police then assigned a new officer to the case who followed the tracker's trail to a row of containers in Edmonton, North London.
When the police opened the containers they not only found Jackson's R6 but also another eight stolen motorcycles.
KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has said that they have decided to develop a system under which all business activities, including shops and markets would start functioning from the morning to evening. “This is the system which operates all over the world.”
Addressing a program­me, organised by the Karachi Cham­ber of Commerce and Indus­try on Wednes­day, the chief minister said that breaking the old habit they as a chief minister has started their day early in the morning, followed by their cabinet members and bureaucracy and now the business people and traders have to follow it by opening their shops and markets at 9am and close by 6pm or 7pm.
“I need your support for the purpose because I know the actual resistance could come from your side,” they said addressing the office-bearers of chambers.
Mr Murad also announced proper timings for” Shadi halls” and to start one-dish policy for valima/marriage functions. “The concept is to reduce the financial burden of poor people,” they said.

This week, Sir Roger Gale, the MP, has come under fire for referring to their female employees as 'girls'. One of their employees, Debi Hill, has defended them - "he's not sexist and we feel valued by him" - but there has been a furore about their decision to refer to the grown women they work with as 'girls'.
It brings to mind the other words that tend to follow women around workplaces - from 'ambitious' to 'bossy' and the dreaded 'feisty' - a word defined in the Collins English Dictionary as:
1) Lively, resilient and self-reliant
2) (US and Canadian) frisky
3) (US and Canadian) irritable.
None of these definitions mentions gender. Indeed, the adjective would appear to be gender neutral – until you look at the example sentences given by the dictionary:
"He realised they were not a feisty woman after all," "Our beauty is now male, and is awoken by a feisty young girl", to "Why were even the most intelligent and feisty women so foolish when it came to being hopelessly in love?" (from the book Tickled Pink).
Not one refers to a ‘feisty male', suggesting the adjective is one of those words that shows a vocabularly gender divide - and a wider level of everyday sexism. A label thrown at women, usually with negative connotations, that would never be used for a man.
Over the past couple of years, there has been a concerted effort to ditch these words. Sheryl Sandberg and Beyoncé spearheaded a campaign to ‘Ban Bossy'. A major study showed that ‘abrasive' is regularly used to describe women in the workplace. And Downton Abbey actor Daisy Lewis spoke out against ‘feisty' - calling it their “least favourite word". They told the Mail on Sunday's You magazine: “Have you ever heard a man described as feisty? Have you heard a male character described as feisty? I think not.”
Philadelphia Union midfielder Alejandro Bedoya has been called up to the United State National Team, while Andre Blake and Bethlehem Steel FC forward Cory Burke have been called up to Jamaica National Team.
The United States are set to host arch-rivals Mexico in Columbus, Ohio on November 11 in the opening round of the World Cup Qualifying Hexagonal. They will then head to San José, Costa Rica to face against Los Ticos in the second match of the Hex on November 15. Bedoya has been a fixture in Jürgen Klinsmann's squad, amassing 55 caps for the United States since their 2010 debut.
Jamaica is playing the make-up match from their Caribbean Cup Qualifier against Suriname on November 13. The original match was postponed due to Hurricane Matthew swinging close to the eastern edge of the island nation. The winner of the match will go on to play in the Caribbean Cup while the loser will enter a fifth-place playoff bracket to qualify. Trinidad and Tobago and Antigua and Barbuda are both already qualified, and the second place team in the group with French Guiana, Haiti, and Saint Kitts and Nevis will also be in the group (Haiti's matches were also postponed and will be played on November 9 against French Guiana and November 13 at Saint Kitts.
Blake has 18 caps with the Reggae Boyz dating back to 2014, and in the 2014 Caribbean up was awarded the Golden Gloves for best goalkeeper for their performance in the tournament - which included leading Jamaica to a win in penalties against Trinidad and Tobago. Burke has made 2 appearances with Jamaica, making their debut against Haiti on September 6 and scoring their first goal against Warren Creavalle and Guyana on October 11.

Obama Knew Arming Rebels Was Useless, But Did It Anyway
We've pointed out for years that arming the Syrian and Libyan rebels to topple leaders we don't like is a really stupid idea.
It turns out that the CIA agrees with us.
The New York Times reports:
The Central Intelligence Agency has run guns to insurgencies across the world during its 67-year history — from Angola to Nicaragua to Cuba [to Syria]. *** An internal C.I.A. study has found that it rarely works. The still-classified review, one of several C.I.A. studies commissioned in 2012 and 2013 in the midst of the Obama administration's protracted debate about whether to wade into the Syrian civil war, concluded that many past attempts by the agency to arm foreign forces covertly had a minimal impact on the long-term outcome of a conflict. They were even less effective, the report found, when the militias fought without any direct American support on the ground. *** The findings of the study, described in recent weeks by current and former American government officials, were presented in the White House Situation Room and led to deep skepticism among some senior Obama administration officials about the wisdom of arming and training members of a fractured Syrian opposition. *** “One of the things that Obama wanted to know was: Did this ever work?” said one former senior administration official who participated in the debate and spoke anonymously because they were discussing a classified report. The C.I.A. report, they said, “was pretty dour in its conclusions.” *** Mr. Obama made a veiled reference to the C.I.A. study in an interview with The New Yorker published this year. Speaking about the dispute over whether they should have armed the rebels earlier, Mr. Obama told the magazine: “Very early in this process, I actually asked the C.I.A. to analyze examples of America financing and supplying arms to an insurgency in a country that actually worked out well. And they couldn't come up with much.” *** Last month, Mr. Obama said they would redouble American efforts by having the Pentagon participate in arming and training rebel forces.
Dan Froomkin – an investigative journalist with the Washington Post, HuffPost and now First Look (and a Democrat) – slams Obama for deciding to arm Syrian rebels even after the CIA told them it wouldn't work, in an article entitled “Obama Knew Arming Rebels Was Useless, But Did It Anyway“:
They knew better, but they did it anyway. *** Bush at least thought the war in Iraq would do some good. They were incredibly wrong, mind you. They were both delusional — and actively manipulated by neocons like Dick Cheney (who believe the application of American power is always and inherently a good thing). They intentionally misled the public about their real reasons for going to war (the terrorist attacks of 9/11 were an excuse, not a reason; there were no Iraqi weapons of mass destruction). Their eventual goal was both unachievable (a sudden flowering of pro-Western democracy in the Middle East) and perverse (American control of Iraqi oil fields). Their methods (firing all the Baathists; trying to install a corrupt puppet) were spectacularly misguided. Much of the rest of their presidency was consumed with sectarian warfare in Iraq and new lies to cover up the old ones at home. And the end result was a massive human rights catastrophe, including torture of U.S. detainees, a refugee crisis, mass casualties, social disorder and – finally – the Islamic State. Bush also certainly saw – and exploited — the political upside of being a war president. But [at least Bush] didn't let loose the dogs of war simply because their political operatives told them it would poll well.
In response to embarrassment caused by the revelation that Obama agreed to arm the Syrian rebels after the CIA warned them it wouldn't do any good, the U.S. military is now saying they won't work with the Syrian rebels.
Specifically, General Allen – the head of America's anti-ISIS campaign – now says that the administration now has no plans to ever coordinate with the Free Syrian Army (FSA) or any other of the existing rebel factions. They say they'll only work with a new coalition of “moderate” rebels.
Sadly, there aren't any moderate rebels in Syria (and see this).
Virtually all of the arms – and humanitarian aid – end up in the hands of the most brutal terrorists.

Cats can be finicky about their bathroom habits, so unless you want to be dealing with a regular mess at home, keeping your cat's litter box up to their standards is very important. The following suggestions should keep your cat from "thinking outside the box."
Boxes & litter
How many?
The general rule of paw is one litter box for each cat in the home, plus one more. That way none of them will ever be prevented from eliminating in the litter box because it's already occupied.
Litter Box Items on Amazon.com
It's not possible to designate a personal litter box for each cat in your household, as cats may use any litter box that's available. That means a cat may occasionally refuse to use a litter box after another cat has been in it. In this case, you'll need to keep all of the litter boxes extremely clean, and you might even need to add additional boxes. However, it's best not to place all the boxes in one location because your cats will think of them as one big box and ambushing another cat will still be possible.
Covered boxes
Some people prefer to provide their cats with a covered litter box. While covered boxes can increase privacy and decrease the amount of litter that flies from the box when your cat buries their business, there are some potential downsides. An “out of sight, out of mind” little box is easy to forget about, which may lead to a dirty box with odors trapped inside (which is even less likely to be appealing to your cat). Covered boxes can also be difficult for larger cats to turn around and position themselves in, and may lead to easier ambushes upon exit.
Ultimately, if your cat doesn't like a covered box, they won't use it. To find out which type your cat prefers, you may want to experiment by offering both types at first.
Self-cleaning boxes
There are a wide variety of litter boxes available that offer convenience and automation in cleaning your cat's litter. Buyers beware: some of these features may prevent a cat from wanting to use their litter box, so if your cat is used to a traditional box, it's best to stick to what they know.
Pick of the litter
There are several different types of cat litter on the market. The most popular ones are traditional clay litter, scooping/clumping litter, crystal-based/silica gel litter and plant-derived/biodegradable litter.
Most cats prefer fine-grained litters, presumably because they have a softer feel. Newer scoopable and “clumping” litter have finer grains than typical clay litter and are very popular because they keep down the odor. But high-quality, dust-free clay litters are fairly small-grained and may be perfectly acceptable to your cat.
Once you find a litter your cat likes, stick with it. Switching litters constantly could result in your cat not using the litter box.
If your cat has previously been an outdoor cat and prefers dirt, you can keep them out of your houseplants by placing medium-sized rocks on top of the soil in the pots. You can also mix some soil with their regular litter to lure them in. A cat who rejects all types of commercial litters may be quite happy with sand.
Many people use scented litter or air freshener to mask litter box odors, but often times, these odors can be offputting to cats. A thin layer of baking soda placed on the bottom of the box will help absorb odors without repelling your cat.
Set up
Most people tend to place the litter box in an out-of-the-way spot to minimize odor and prevent cat litter from being tracked throughout the house. But if the litter box ends up in the basement next to a creepy appliance or on a cold cement floor, your cat may be less than pleased, so you may have to compromise.
Keep the litter box in a spot that gives your cat some privacy but is also convenient. If the box is too hard to get to, especially for a kitten or an elderly cat, they just may not use it.
Avoid placing litter boxes next to noisy or heat-radiating appliances, like the furnace or the washing machine. Noises can make a cat nervous, while heat from a dryer or furnace can magnify the litter box smell, which could make them stay away from the litter box.
Put the box far away from their food and water bowls. Place at least one litter box on each level of your house. That way your cat has options if access to their primary box is blocked (the basement door is closed or your dinner party has them holed up in the bedroom.) If you have more than one cat, provide litter boxes in several locations so that one cat can't ambush another cat using the litter box.
If you keep the litter box in a closet or a bathroom, be sure the door is wedged open from both sides to prevent your cat from being trapped inside or locked out. Depending on the location, you might consider cutting a hole in a closet door and adding a pet door.
Cleaning
To meet the needs of the most discriminating cat, you should scoop feces out of the litter box daily. How often you actually replace the litter depends on the number of cats you have, the number of litter boxes and the type of litter you use.
Twice a week is a general guideline for replacing clay litter, but depending on your circumstances, you may need to replace it every other day or only once a week. If you clean the litter box daily, you might only need to change clumping litter every two to three weeks. If you notice an odor or if much of the litter is wet or clumped, it's time for a change. Scrub the box every time you change the litter. Use mild dish detergent to clean it, as products with ammonia or citrus oils can turn a cat off, and some cleaning products are toxic to cats.
Liner notes
Box liners are strictly a convenience for the owner; supposedly, the liner can be gathered together and tied just like a garbage bag, but the truth is that most cats shred it to bits while scratching in the box. However, it might work if your cat doesn't work too hard to bury their waste.
Depth of litter
Most cats won't use litter that's more than about two inches deep. In fact, some long-haired cats actually prefer less litter and a smooth, slick surface, such as the bottom of the box. Adding extra litter won't reduce the amount of cleaning necessary for a litter box.
Training
There's really no such thing as "litter training" a cat in the same way one would housetrain a dog. You actually don't need to teach your cat what to do with a litter box; instinct will generally take over. You do need to provide an acceptable, accessible litter box, using the suggestions above.
It's not necessary to take your cat to the litter box and move their paws back and forth in the litter. If you move to a new place, however, you will need to show your cat where the box is.
If problems begin
If your cat begins to go to the bathroom outside the litter box, your first call should always be to your veterinarian. Many medical conditions can cause a change in a cat's litter box habits. If your veterinarian examines your cat and gives them a clean bill of health, your cat may have a behavior problem that needs to be solved.
Punishment is not the answer, nor is banishing your cat outdoors. For long-standing or complex situations, contact an animal-behavior specialist who has experience working with cats.

We are so fortunate Rex Tillerson was willing to take on the role of Secretary of State. T. rex's approach is giving the pearl-clutching leftists fits, as outlined in this article by ABC which displays their collective angst.
(Via ABC) [..] In their first weeks as America's top diplomat, Tillerson has gone to great lengths to avoid attracting attention, despite a growing perception in Washington that the State Department is being sidelined by a power-centric White House.
Some State Department officials have been told by the White House to expect drastic budget cuts, with much of the reduction potentially coming out of U.S. foreign aid money. Trump and their team have also told those interviewing for top State Department jobs that significant staffing cuts will come. Some appear to have started already.
While Tillerson was in Germany, several senior management and advisory positions were eliminated. The staffers were reassigned. Some other top posts are vacant, and there are no signs they'll be quickly filled.
While Tillerson has met or spoken with dozens of foreign counterparts in their first weeks, the White House is driving the front-page diplomacy. The lack of State Department involvement has flustered many long-time diplomats.
[…] It's a sharp contrast with the Obama administration's last secretary of state, John Kerry, who routinely found their way to the center of global crises, enthusiastically fulfilling the “public diplomacy” part of the job. Whereas Kerry exhausted staff with impromptu, whirlwind foreign trips and constant press appearances, Tillerson has made it known to their staff that they want a lower profile.
In private, the Texas oilman with the booming baritone voice is deliberate, independent and cool-headed, according to U.S. and foreign diplomats who have interacted with them and spoke on condition of anonymity in order to avoid possible diplomatic fallout from discussing private conversations. A common thread in Tillerson's meetings with diplomats has been an emphasis on safety of U.S. personnel, State Department officials said.
It's a continuation of a theme Tillerson touched on when they spoke to staffers on their first day, and one they plan to echo this coming week on a trip to Mexico City with Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Tillerson will stop at the U.S. Embassy to meet with American diplomats, officials said.
Diplomats from several foreign countries said Tillerson is playing it safe in high-level meetings so far, avoiding extemporaneous comments. They show up seeming well-prepared and confident on the substance of issues, rarely consulting their aides or written notes, they reported.
In Germany last week, Tillerson urged China to help address North Korea's nuclear threat. They called on Russia to honor a 2015 peace plan for Ukraine.
While those signs of continuity in U.S. policy may have assuaged some foreign leaders' concerns about Trump, Tillerson's tight-lipped nature unsettled others.
After meeting Tillerson, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault lamented the “vague” U.S. position on issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Tillerson told several of their international partners the U.S. is still in “listening mode,” leaving some with the perception that Trump may craft U.S. foreign policy on the fly.
In a rare interaction with reporters, Tillerson said before leaving Germany they were bringing home “many” messages for Trump. Asked to share a few, they demurred.
“Not until I share it with him,” they said. (link)
Everything T. rex has done so far is absolutely pitch perfect; this guy is buckets of pure American awesome. Deliberate, focused, steadfast and intensely well-grounded, Tillerson is a walking example of just the right person at just the right time.
Out of all the Trump cabinet appointments that will be recorded in history, Secretary T. rex will be at the very top of the list.
And to remind everyone, Rex Tillerson was the cabinet nominee that Mark Levin said was the worst possible selection in history. HERE and HERE – Think about that level of disconnected idiocy the next time anyone gives you an opinion from Old Yeller.
The globalist-liberals are having fits over the impenetrable approach being taken by Secretary Tillerson. T. rex is in the center of the global elitist power structure, The Department of State.
The U.S. State Department is the epicenter of all globalist ideological enterprise, and T. rex is thoughtfully, unemotionally, deconstructing the entire DoS system – worst parts first, while they watch.
One of the greatest attributes of legendary leaders is their mastery of the silent power that exists in the space between words. When you witness those who exhibit this skill-set you know immediately you are seeing a person of consequence, yet you can't quite put your finger on why.
We are very fortunate to be living in such consequential times.

Sorey is a human youth who grew up among the “seraphim” (tenzoku), spiritual beings not visible to humans.
Sorey believes in the folklore that says “long ago, every human was able to see the seraphim” and dreams of unraveling the ancient mystery to make the world a place where people and seraphim can live together in peace. One day, Sorey visits the human capital for the very first time. They become embroiled in an incident during which they pull out a holy sword imbedded in a rock and ends up becoming a “Shepherd,” one who casts away calamity from the world.

Erendira Wallenda, the wife of famed daredevil Nik Wallenda, has broken their husband's record, dangling 300 ft. above Niagara Falls by their teeth.
Get push notifications with news, features and more.
In 2012, Nik, 38, became the first person to cross Niagara Falls on a high wire — now, Erendira, 38, has outdone their famous husband, dangling out of a helicopter by their teeth for about 20 seconds above Horseshoe Falls, the largest of the three falls that make up Niagara Falls.
“If a guy can do it a girl can do it too,” Erendira told reporters after the performance. “We just do it with a little more grace.”

Erendira and Nik, who was in the helicopter, shared a kiss and a hug after they made it safely back to land.
They told reporters that it was windy and shaky during the stunt, much different than the Florida weather in which they usually practice.
The mom of three took off for the falls just after 8:30 a.m. and was soon putting on their aerial performance in a suspended hoop above the mist. They were expected to hang from their ankles first during the stunt, but decided to start with my teeth.

“If you're scared of it, then it becomes dangerous,” Erendira told reporters ahead of the performance, The Buffalo News reports. “I respect what I do, but I definitely will be taking in the view. That's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but I'm definitely not fearful.”
The stunt comes nearly five years after Nik put on the headline-making performance, crossing 200 ft. above the falls. In a press conference after the act, Nik introduce Erendira as “the new world record holder.”
“It was absolutely amazing,” Nik gushed to reporters. To be out there watching them … they had a huge grin on their face the whole time.”
Officials declared June 16, 2017, Erendira Wallenda Day in Niagara County, New York.

"I was not expecting too much from the harness but was tired of trying to carry my laptop while doing wifi surveys. I have a 17" laptop and the ends of the laptop hung over the base of the harness, but once it was adjusted correctly it held the laptop. It did take some time to get used to the harness and not feel like the laptop was going to slip out. I have used it now for an hour at a time, many times now, and I never would have been able to do that holding the laptop in my hand."
"This is a very good tool to keep the laptop safe and secure whenever there isn't a stable or clean surface available."

(BERLIN) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Friday for stepped-up efforts towards a transatlantic trade pact as they welcomed US Vice President Joe Biden for talks in Berlin.
Speaking ahead of the meeting, Merkel said: "Personally, I would like us to move forward in the EU-US free trade negotiations."
They added there were "positive signs" in that President Barack Obama has put the issue on the agenda for their second term in office.
EU leaders at a summit on Thursday were expected to discuss the planned free-trade deal with the United States, which is seen as potentially providing a boost to the economies of both regions.
Negotiations have become bogged down amid disagreements over agricultural subsidies.
For their part, Biden described Germany as "an absolutely essential, critical partner" and added that "the transatlantic alliance continues to be the basis upon which our entire relations in the world rest."
"Without a strong Europe and close ties to Europe, it is not conceivable how America's interests can be met around the world," said the vice president.
The vice president was holding talks with Merkel before travelling down to the southern German city of Munich for the annual security conference of top brass and foreign policy officials.
They will deliver a speech on foreign policy there on Saturday and hold talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, UN-Arab League peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi and Syrian opposition chief Moaz al-Khatib.
In February, CBS announced that it would be pulling the plug on The Good Wife after seven seasons. The long-running legal procedural from creators Robert and Michelle King was widely expected to hang up its robe at the end of this year, as the Kings are set to launch a new program on the network next fall (it's a Washington satire about extraterrestrials who feast on the brains of politicians). The show's quality declined in recent years, but The Good Wife remained the finest drama on network television. It was a female-led answer to TV's testosterone-heavy 21st-century Golden Age, dominated by the male antiheroes of Breaking Bad and Mad Men.
One widely overlooked aspect of the program's success wasn't just that it was home to some of television's most complex female characters, but that The Good Wife was one of the queerest shows on TV. While shows like Glee, Orange Is The New Black, or Transparent might be more overtly LGBT-oriented, what makes The Good Wife special is that the show radically rewrote the rules of identity politics. While Glee treated sexuality as a “very special episode” subject, The Good Wife was refreshingly post-queer, never allowing its characters or the actors that played them to be bound by labels.

After debuting in 2009, the show was credited for introducing the first queer South Asian character in television history—Kalinda Sharma (Archie Panjabi), the stoic investigator who strikes up a tentative friendship with Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies). Outside of their work at Lockhart/Gardner, where Alicia lands a job as a first-year associate following their husband Peter's imprisonment, viewers initially know little about Kalinda. We know she's in their mid-20s, wears knee-high boots and leather jackets, and sports an unplaceable accent. Panjabi is British, but Kalinda Sharma is a mystery.
When it comes to Kalinda's personal life, The Good Wife got off on being withholding. When Alicia first asks Kalinda about their sexuality while sharing a drink after work, they respond, “I'm private.” Earlier in the show's first season, they flirt with Lana Delaney (Jill Flint), a comely FBI agent who doesn't understand why Kalinda has “sex with men.” Kalinda explains, “I don't distinguish… Italian, Mexican, Thai—why does one choose one food over the other?” In another scene, a rival investigator (Scott Porter) asserts that Kalinda likes “women more than men.” They shrug, “Sometimes. Depends.”
To dismiss these questions was not a matter of evading the character's orientation, but a crucial part of it. Throughout The Good Wife, other characters attempted to place Kalinda into a box (and many fans refer to them as “bisexual”), but they continually resist easy categorization. After all, the defining feature of their romantic relationships isn't who they sleep with but that she's as elusive about commitment as they are about labeling. When they and upstart attorney Cary Agos (Matt Czuchry) begin dating during the show's sixth season, they repeatedly refer to them as their “girlfriend.” However, Kalinda reminds them that they have no plans to be exclusive, with Cary or anyone else. They complicate societal notions of monogamy and homonormativity in ways that are extremely powerful.

But The Good Wife doesn't always handle Kalinda's sexual detachment with grace. In one of the show's worst and most infamous subplots, the writers attempt to explain away their penchant for privacy as the result of an abusive relationship: She's not liberated, she's scared. The fourth season introduced Nick Savarese (Marc Warren), a truck magnate who happens to be Kalinda's domineering ex-husband. Their relationship is both tense and violent, with fights that unfold like foreplay. The plotline was quickly scrapped due to fan outcry—because it threatened to undo everything that was great about Kalinda.
At their best, Kalinda's elusive sexuality transcended tired tropes about “slutty bisexuals” because their particularities were in service of character first, rather than reducing them to a plot device. As June Thomas wrote in Slate, “The people they had sex with seemed as confused as the viewers about Kalinda's feelings.” Throughout their on-and-off relationship, Lana continually becomes frustrated with their inability to read Kalinda or decipher their motives. Is Kalinda trying to get information or genuinely interested? Lana memorably confronted them on the subject: “I chased you for two years and nothing. What? Now you're into me?”
The show's emphasis on character first was likewise illustrated in its continued mission to cast openly LGBT stars in a variety of roles throughout the show, playing characters who are straight, presumably heterosexual, or whose sexualities are never mentioned. In fact, The Good Wife functioned as an unofficial halfway house for out actors—including Nathan Lane, John Benjamin Hickey, T.R. Knight, Denis O'Hare, Michael Urie, Mo Rocca, Jonathan Groff, David Hyde Pierce, and Alan Cumming. Not a single one plays an overtly queer character. Cumming, who identifies as bisexual, has spent seven seasons on the show as Eli Gold, who works as Peter Florrick's gubernatorial campaign manager and later chief of staff. Gold was married to a woman (Parker Posey) and only expresses romantic interest in women. Lane guest starred as Clarke Hayden, an auditor assigned to Lockhart/Gardner who becomes a lawyer at Alicia's firm. Their sexuality is never deemed all that important, so it isn't brought up. In fact, the most prominent recurring gay character is played by a straight actor: Dallas Robert frequently appears on the show as Alicia's brother. Archie Panjabi is likewise heterosexual.

The show's consistent sexuality swap is a necessary answer to the common misconception about gay actors: Audiences won't take them seriously in straight roles. In 2010, former Newsweek writer Ramin Setoodeh trashed the Broadway revival of Promises, Promises, arguing that former Will & Grace actor Sean Hayes was “too queeny” to play someone the audience is expected to believe is in love with Kristin Chenoweth. “[I]t's weird seeing Hayes play straight,” Setoodeh wrote. “He comes off as wooden and insincere, as if he's trying to hide something, which of course they are.”
Critics might have been outraged that Setoodeh would assert that it's rare for gay actors to “pull off the trick” of playing heterosexual—even though Heath Ledger did just fine at performing the reverse in Brokeback Mountain—but their views are hardly unique. The year before the Newsweek controversy, Rupert Everett made similar comments to The Guardian, advising young gay actors to stay in the closet. In 2015, Matt Damon reiterated the same argument. “I think you're a better actor the fewer people know about you, period,” they infamously said. “And sexuality is a huge part of that. Whether you're straight or gay, people shouldn't know anything about your sexuality because that's one of the mysteries that you should be able to play.”
But if Kalinda is any indication, those mysteries are best saved for the characters themselves. What makes a character like Kalinda Sharma compelling isn't what we know about Panjabi's and Kalinda's sexuality (or maybe don't) but how those tensions are integrated into the character. Similarly, Alan Cumming's real-life queerness only makes Eli Gold more fascinating: He's clearly based off the coarse Rahm Emanuel, the former chief of staff to Barack Obama who's the current mayor of Chicago. But despite Gold's alpha dog, “Look, I know curse words” shtick, Cumming adds an undercurrent of vulnerability to their character.

The fact that actors inherently hide something isn't a detriment: It's how dramas build tension and complexity, whether that's in front of or behind the camera. After Panjabi left The Good Wife in the sixth season, rumors circulated that their departure was due to a falling-out with Margulies. Their characters hadn't appeared in a scene together in two seasons, and a final drink between the two was spliced together in green screen. Although Margulies offered a telling non-answer— “There's no animosity on my part”—and insisted Archie Panjabi was merely busy shooting BBC's The Fall, Panjabi responded that their show wasn't in production at the time. “I was in New York, ready to film the scene,” they said on Twitter.
While many argued this was a distraction from the show—knowing that its female leads might hate each other in real life—there was something extremely fitting about the alleged feud. The Good Wife spent seasons building a world that takes place behind closed doors, through secret phone calls and backroom deals. It's a show about what is unsaid or barely whispered, whether that's a long-simmering affair with a coworker, its characters' labyrinthine sexualities, or the hidden politics behind the scenes. If Kalinda was an unsolvable riddle, they were the perfect symbol for The Good Wife itself.
This isn't getting a lot of attention. But it should. Everybody took note when Donald Trump repeatedly claimed that American Muslims across the river in New Jersey celebrated and cheered as the Twin Towers fell on 9/11 – an entirely fabricated claim. Last night on Bill O'Reilly's show and then separately at a rally in Westfield, Indiana they did something very similar and in so doing cemented their status an impulsive propagator of race-hatred and violence.
The details of the rapid-fire fulmination are important. So let's look at them closely.
Trump claimed that people – “some people” – called for a moment of silence for mass killer Micah Johnson, the now deceased mass shooter who killed five police officers in Dallas on Thursday night. There is no evidence this ever happened. Searches of the web and social media showed no evidence. Even Trump's campaign co-chair said today that they can't come up with any evidence that it happened. As in the case of the celebrations over the fall of the twin towers, even to say there's ‘no evidence' understates the matter. This didn't happen. Trump made it up.
The language is important: “When somebody called for a moment of silence to this maniac that shot the five police, you just see what's going on. It's a very, very sad situation.”
Then later at the Indiana rally: “The other night you had 11 cities potentially in a blow-up stage. Marches all over the United States—and tough marches. Anger. Hatred. Hatred! Started by a maniac! And some people ask for a moment of silence for him. For the killer!”
A would-be strong man, an authoritarian personality, isn't just against disorder and violence. They need disorder and violence. That is their raison d'etre, it is the problem that they are purportedly there to solve. The point bears repeating: authoritarian figures require violence and disorder. Look at the language. “11 cities potentially in a blow up stage” .. “Anger. Hatred. Hatred! Started by a maniac!” … “And some people ask for a moment of silence for him. For the killer.”
At the risk of invoking Godwin's Law, if you translate the German, the febrile and agitated language of ‘hatred', ‘anger', ‘maniac' … this is the kind of florid and incendiary language Adolf Hitler used in many of their speeches. Note too the actual progression of what Trump said: “Marches all over the United States – and tough marches. Anger. Hatred. Hatred! Started by a maniac!” (emphasis added).
The clear import of this fusillade of words is that the country is awash in militant protests that were inspired by Micah Johnson. “Started by …”
We're used to so much nonsense and so many combustible tirades from Trump that we become partly inured to them. We also don't slow down and look at precisely what he's saying. What he's saying here is that millions of African-Americans are on the streets inspired by and protesting on behalf of a mass murderer of white cops.
This is not simply false. It is the kind of wild racist incitement that puts whole societies in danger. And this man wants to be president.
There's no question these are very volatile times. So many of us saw the news Friday that a black man murdered five white police officers over anger at police harassment of black men. Beyond the horror of the act itself, those are the kinds of horrific, societal-fabric-tearing events that can pull our whole country apart and press us toward the abyss.
But that hasn't happened.
There have continued to be protests. There's no reason why there should not be. But every Black Lives Matter leader of any note has spoken clearly denouncing Johnson's atrocity. Indeed, if anything the continuing protests have been tempered calls for an end to violence on all sides. For all the horror, the outrage has spawned moments of bridge-building, unity. So these are combustible times. But they're not the racial end times Trump is describing. Indeed, what Trump said in the passage above is something verging on the notorious “big lie”. Micah Johnson didn't inspire any marches. No one is marching on their behalf. Even the truly radical and potentially violent black nationalist fringe groups had apparently shunned them even before the shooting. No one called for a moment of silence on Johnson's behalf or honored them in any way. This is just an up is down straight up lie served up for the purpose of stoking fear, menace and race hate.
These are the words – the big lies rumbling the ground for some sort of apocalyptic race war – of a dangerous authoritarian personality who is either personally deeply imbued with racist rage or cynically uses that animus and race hatred to achieve political ends. In either case, they are the words of a deeply dangerous individual the likes of whom has seldom been so close to achieving executive power in America.
An Interview with Michael Costuros
“Is it scalable?” This is the first question you often get asked as an entrepreneur.
Scale, scale, scale…everyone wants to do it, and it sounds soooo good. But far too frequently when we think of “scaling”, we think only of the end result – the amazing pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
Truth is, that rainbow is more like a rocky road and you will inevitably face many challenges, as well as unforeseen (and unimagined!) obstacles, as you pave the road of sustainable growth.
I recently interviewed Michael Costuros, founder of SaaS company liveBooks.com and currently a leadership coach for startup executive teams. Michael offered super-valuable insights into the hurdles that companies face when it comes to scaling the culture you want along the growth trajectory.
Shouting above the win
What are the common mistakes companies make when scaling with regards to company culture? And is there a tipping point in company size where major danger zones exist?
You can't talk about company culture without talking about communication. Most think that culture is created by the mission, environment and personality of the company, but really, the company culture is an emergent quality of the communication style and practices of the people in the organization. If you just design your culture of communication, you can keep the culture you love as you grow.
Startups usually begin with two founders who are involved with everything, and the culture tone is set. As they steadily bring on new people, the culture continues to grow and is embraced by the team. Then something changes around 20 people. Once companies grow to this level, each team member will have less time for each other. Sometimes a few people have been brought on primarily for their skill set, but they are not a great fit for the company culture and can dilute it.
Typically around this time, founders start feeling some concern about their company culture, and wonder how they will be able to maintain what they love about it while they continue to scale. This is the time that setting the mission, vision and core values all of a sudden becomes a real priority. But all too often the key element, communication, is neglected, and despite the best efforts, maintaining the culture is a struggle.
Start now
When is the right time to develop a strong culture? Is it ever too late?
The ideal time to identify and solidify the company's communication culture is when it is small, around 5 to 10 people. If you don't already have a well-defined culture, start now no matter how big the company is. Here are some tips for developing yours:
Notice the natural style of your current communication among the leadership team.
What's working great? What do you want to see more of?
On a scale of 1 to 10, how much do you ACTUALLY, (not just in principal), value speaking your truth, healthy opposition or conflict, transparency, humor, accountability, or whatever other traits you want to cultivate in your organization.
Leaders establish the tone for the company values and culture. Set intentions to increase the behaviors that you want, and remove what is not working. Once the leadership team walks its talk, you can roll it out to the company.
The art of asking questions
Once a culture of communication is established how do you maintain it?
I see 15Five as the perfect tool for implementing your core communication culture. If you just design the questions, and encourage employees to respond using the communication guidelines of your culture, then each time they engage with 15Five, they will be consistently strengthening the core company culture during the most important information exchanges of the week.
In summary, I agree that a company culture is like a complex jungle ecosystem. If you approach it from the wrong perspective, it can seem unmanageable. However, if you focus on strengthening the highest leverage influencers in the ecosystem, like old growth trees, then the ecosystem culture will naturally thrive.

Here's your chance to get some quick coaching! Leave a specific question for Michael in the comments section below.
An Overlea woman said they will return the $43,000 in donations they received through an online fundraising campaign they began after claiming a neighbor complained their yard was "becoming Relentlessly Gay."
Julie Baker who created the GoFundMe campaign, wrote on the site this week "it is with a saddened heart that all donations will be returned," citing "taxes and an overabundance of resources."
Baker started the fundraiser after finding a note at the door of their Kenwood Avenue home where they had decorated their yard with a rainbow-colored lawn ornament.
"Your yard is becoming Relentlessly Gay!" the note said. "Myself and Others in the neighborhood ask that you Tone It Down. This is a Christian area and there are Children. Keep it up and I will be Forced to call the Police on You! Your kind need to have Respect for GOD."
They posted a picture of the note on Facebook and created the GoFundMe page to raise $50 or to paint rainbows on their house, they said. But the note exploded online, garnering support from all over, and the donations came flooding in. Some skeptics criticized her, believing the note was fake.
Julie Baker received a note describing their yard as "relentlessly gay" after they put up jars in the colors of the rainbow in their yard. They have responded to this with a GoFundMe effort to decorate their house with more rainbows.

The GoFundMe page was briefly taken down, which Baker said previously was while site administrators were reaching out to them to verify the campaign's legitimacy.
Baker suspended the campaign in June, saying they have received much more than they anticipated when they first created the page.
In a previous interview with The Baltimore Sun they said they are pro-gay rights but that the yard decoration was merely because of their love of rainbows — which are often used as gay-rights symbols.
In their latest post, Baker said the campaign was never about the donations.
"If a time machine were available, it would have all ended at the original requested amount. It was never about the money but being happy in the face of intolerance," they wrote.
They asked that those who make donations take them back and give to local artists or educational nonprofit organizations, the post says.

Clippers guard Austin Rivers talks to their father and head coach, Doc Rivers, during a timeout against the Hornets during a December game at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte. (Photo11: Sam Sharpe, USA TODAY Sports)
LAS VEGAS — Austin Rivers had heard enough.
For two days, the 24-year-old Los Angeles Clippers guard heard all the chatter about how they were to blame for Chris Paul's exit to the Houston Rockets late last month. It was easy to ignore at first, but then the media din grew louder.
ESPN. Fox Sports One. The LA radio airwaves. Everyone was talking about the story from ESPN anchor Michael Eaves, who reported on their professional Facebook page that the dynamic between Clippers coach and president of basketball operations Doc Rivers and their son was a major reason for Paul deciding to orchestrate the trade.
This was hardly the first time someone had alleged that Paul and Doc Rivers didn't see eye to eye, but the level of detail relating to Austin's alleged role took the topic to a new level. So, after Paul had texted Rivers to refute the report, Austin picked up the phone.
“I called Chris and was like, ‘Chris, what's going on?''” Austin Rivers told USA TODAY Sports while in town to watch NBA summer league. “Chris is like, ‘This is the biggest bull(expletive) I've ever seen in my life.' Chris was just like, ‘This is a joke.' So I asked him, I'm like, ‘You don't need to come out and say nothing publicly, I don't need you to do that. It's just going to make it even more, now they're going to drag it out two more days. I'll take it. I don't care. I've been dealing with this (dynamic) since I was six (years old). I really don't even care.'”

The two spoke for approximately 40 minutes, with Paul reiterating to Austin that their reasons for leaving had more to do with their desire to join James Harden's Rockets than they did the Clippers.
“What do I have to do with someone else's move?” Austin Rivers asked. “Chris wanted to move because he'd been (with the Clippers) for a while. He's had great years there, but they wanted something new. A lot of players want that. It's really that simple.”
All things considered, the Clippers have recovered nicely.
After netting seven players in exchange for Paul (chief among them veteran guard Patrick Beverley and super sixth man Lou Williams) as well as a 2018 first-round pick, they re-signed five-time All-Star forward Blake Griffin on a five-year, $173 million deal and filled a longstanding need at small forward by adding free agent Danilo Gallinari on a three-year, $65 million deal. The losses of shooting guard J.J. Redick (via free agency to Philadelphia) and three-time Sixth Man of the Year Jamal Crawford (to Atlanta in the three-team Gallinari sign-and-trade) will hurt as well, but the Clippers should still be competitive.
“We still think we're a playoff team,” Austin Rivers said.
LATEST NBA COVERAGE:
Still, after the Clippers won at least 60% of their games in the last six seasons and reached the second round of the playoffs three times, it's a far cry from Doc Rivers' stated plan heading into the summer: keeping Lob City together, with Paul and Griffin both re-signing. Instead, the Clippers go forward with a new roster and more questions.
Not only are Clippers center DeAndre Jordan, Beverley, Williams and Austin Rivers able to be free agents next summer, but stars like LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, DeMarcus Cousins, Paul could be available too. The Clippers, who recently added Lakers legend Jerry West as a consultant and are hopeful he'll help with their recruiting efforts, should be in the running for at least a few of the bigger names.
For Austin's part, he's ecstatic to spend the season alongside the 28-year-old Beverley in the Clippers' new backcourt. With Redick gone, Austin is expected to become a starter.
“I've always been a fan of Patrick Beverley,” Austin said. “I think as far as defensive backcourts, it's really – I don't see too many that can bring what we bring … I do think it can be a great defensive backcourt.”

Austin and Beverley sat together courtside during the Clippers summer league game at UNLV's Cox Pavilion on Sunday, and have wasted no time building a relationship. On Monday, they were scheduled to workout in Las Vegas with new additions Sam Dekker and Montrezl Harrell and possibly Jordan.
“We've hung out here in Vegas, just trying to get acclimated,” Rivers said of Beverley. “We're actually putting that effort forward just because we're going to be that backcourt next year. So it's important.
“Chris is an elite player, obviously. He's a superstar. He's a Hall of Famer, so losing someone like that in general hurts. But you get another great player who is continuing to get better. It seems like Patrick has gotten better every year he's been in the league, shooting it better and everybody knows what they do defensively. … We have a lot of bright spots.”

In a case of being in the right place at the right time, the MESSENGER spacecraft was able to capture a average-sized solar flare, allowing astronomers to study high-energy solar neutrons at less than 1 astronomical unit (AU) from the sun for the first time. When the flare erupted on Dec. 31, 2007, MESSENGER – on course for entering orbit around Mercury — was flying at about half an AU, said William C. Feldman, a scientist at the Planetary Science Institute. Previously, only the neutron bursts from the most powerful solar flares have been recorded on neutron spectrometers on Earth or in near-Earth orbit. The MESSENGER results help solve a mystery of why some coronal mass ejections produce almost no energetic protons that reach the Earth, while others produce huge amounts.
Solar flares spew high-energy neutrons into interplanetary space. Typically, these bursts last about 50 to 60 seconds at the sun. But MESSENGER's Neutron Spectrometer was able to record neutrons from this flare over a period of six to ten hours. “What that's telling us is that at least some moderate-sized flares continuously produce high-energy neutrons in the solar corona.” Said Feldman. “From this fact, we inferred the continuous production of protons in the 30-to-100-MeV (million electron volt) range due to the flare.”
About 90 percent of all ions produced by a solar flare remain locked to the sun on closed magnetic lines, but another population results from the decay of the neutrons near the sun. This second population of decayed neutrons forms an extended seed population in interplanetary space that can be further accelerated by the massive shock waves produced by the flares, Feldman said.
“So the important results are that perhaps after many flare events two things may occur: continuous production of neutrons over an extended period of time and creation of seed populations of neutrons near the sun that have decayed into protons,” Feldman said. “When coronal mass ejections (nuclear explosions in the corona) send shock waves into space, these feedstock protons are accelerated into interplanetary space.”
“There has always been the question of why some coronal mass ejections produce almost no energetic protons that reach the Earth, while others produce huge amounts,” they added. “It appears that these seed populations of energetic protons near the sun could provide the answer, because it's easier to accelerate a proton that already has an energy of 1 MeV than a proton that is at 1 keV (the solar wind).”
The seed populations are not evenly distributed, Feldman said. Sometimes they're in the right place for the shock waves to send them toward Earth, while at other times they're in locations where the protons are accelerated in directions that don't take them near Earth.
The radiation produced by solar flares is of more than academic interest to NASA, Feldman added. Energetic protons from solar flares can damage Earth-orbiting satellites and endanger astronauts on the International Space Station or on missions to the Moon and Mars.
“People in the manned spaceflight program are very interested in being able to predict when a coronal mass ejection is going to be effective in generating dangerous levels of high-energy protons that produce a radiation hazard for astronauts,” they said.
To do this, scientists need to know a lot more about the mechanisms that produce flares and which flare events are likely to be dangerous. At some point they hope to be able to predict space weather — where precipitation is in the form of radiation — with the same accuracy that forecasters predict rain or snow on Earth.
MESSENGER could provide significant data toward this goal, Feldman observed. “What we saw and published is what we hope will be the first of many flares we'll be able to follow through 2012,” they said. “The beauty of MESSENGER is that it's going to be active from the minimum to the maximum solar activity during Solar Cycle 24, allowing us to observe the rise of a solar cycle much closer to the sun than ever before.”
MESSENGER is currently orbiting the sun between 0.3 and 0.6 AU — (an AU is the average distance between the Earth and the sun, or about 150,000 km) — on its way to orbit insertion around Mercury in March 2011. At Mercury, it will be within 0.45 AU of the sun for one Earth year.

Catching up on American affairs after nearly three weeks overseas has been a challenging cultural experience. In Europe, including the United Kingdom, coverage of American political affairs lurches between belligerent ignorance and Late Communist International malice, and Fox News is displaced by the vastly less insightful Sky News, as they are geographic divisions of the same company.
Europeans generally make a distinction between the great and powerful nation of America and the caricature of somewhat unworldly people that they stereotype as Americans, from generations of rather wide-eyed American tourists and GIs through more tailored and sonorous, but uncontinentally purposeful, American business people and academics of more recent times.
Because the president of the United States is the chief of state and head of government  in Franklin D. Roosevelts phrase, the head of the American people  there is a natural tendency, accentuated by timeless Euro-pretension, to impute to the country the shortcomings of the leader, but not to credit the American public with the qualities of its most sophisticated leaders.
FDR and John F. Kennedy were admired as the suave and sophisticated and cultured men they were, and in Roosevelts time Europe, having laid the leaden eggs of Communism and Nazism on the world, was so desperate that it was prepared to embrace a corn-cobbing American private as a liberating Adonis. Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Ford, Reagan, and Bush Sr. were seen more or less fairly for their good qualities as well as their limitations.
Richard Nixons intelligence and Bill Clintons facile adeptness were admitted, though their shortcomings were somewhat exaggerated. Jimmy Carter and Lyndon Johnson never really registered, George W. Bush was not respected, and Barack Obama, abroad as at home, was greeted with excitement that soured over the years into disappointment.
None of it has prepared anyone in Europe or Britain to understand the current president and I return to find the United States public discourse reduced to the most unfathomable absurdity in my 60 years as a diligent auditor of it. (Fortunately, of course, it doesnt matter what the Europeans think of the U.S.; its just the context from which I have emerged in the past few days.)
As the vagaries of intercontinental travel with connecting flights unfolded with rather more than their usual inconvenience, I was struck sharply by the screaming televised horror of the terrible tandem of Virginias U.S. senators. Senator Mark Warner struck first, distracting the viewer from their stumbling inarticulation with a dazzling display of large white Chiclet teeth.
Mr Warner declared that the Steele Dossier  lest we forget, the document about the Golden Shower of urinating prostitutes the president had allegedly choreographed in a Moscow hotel bed once occupied by the Obamas; the beginning of fake news; this splendid founding mission statement of the never Trumpers  had come from a source the British, an ally, took seriously.
As I was recovering my mental equilibrium and faith in checks and balances (as a political concept and not a banking expression), a haymaker came in from the other and equally obtuse Virginia senator, Tim Kaine, the most forgettable candidate for national office in recent years. Donald Trump Jr., by meeting a Russian lawyer represented to them as having information that emanated from the Russian government and was damaging to the Clinton-Kaine campaign, may have committed treason. Dare we imagine this man as vice president?
I sat down in the airport-lounge chair, grateful to have been spared the secret weapon, the pièce de résistance, of the Democratic-loser/jackal-media alliance, the puffy-faced allegory of the otherwise inexpressible stupidity of their Hollywood constituents, Congressman Adam Schiff. My brief sigh of thanksgiving was premature; the swingeing stroke of the scythe of official idiocy was inexorable.
We are all as we are and not really responsible for our physical features, and the problem with Adam Schiff is what they say, not how they look. But as they swung from side to side to address the unusually wide range of the battery of cameras, and torqued up to maximum righteous claptrap (an exhilaratingly swift levitation), it put me in mind of Kafkas description (in their novel America, after all) of words rolling furiously over [a] bulging lower lip, a loose heavy piece of flesh which was easily agitated.
Terrible, unspeakable, and indeed, to stick with Kafka, nameless crimes had probably occurred, though Congressman Schiff could not detail them because of the confidentiality requirements of the House Intelligence Committee (as if there were the slightest chance that that, or any, committee had produced an illegality as serious as a $20 parking ticket).
At least Mr. Warner had said the Senate Intelligence Committee, where they are the ranking Democrat, had been too distracted arranging the appearances of former FBI director James Comey and Attorney General Sessions, which required almost two days, to adduce any evidence beyond the allegations of the Golden Shower. I sank resignedly into my airport chair, trying to grasp the implications that the Democratic party and the Unitd States Congress had been reduced to such an oceanic depth of political and press imbecility.
These, after all, are the facts: The Democrats are still trying to pretend that they did not lose the election. They started with Trump-Kremlin collusion and are clinging to the threads of the corpse of this false concept that come from stupid but irrelevant events such as Mr. Trumps son, son-in-law, and thencampaign manager responding to a suggestion that they meet with a Russian official source of damaging information about Hillary Clinton.
Their brains must have temporarily turned to mush to have gone to such a meeting without being accompanied by counsel and without putting a legal caution in young Mr. Trumps e-mail to the convener, and in failing subsequently to volunteer that the meeting had occurred. They should have seen that it was more likely a set-up by a successor of the old Russian crown prosecutor (an office that has not existed in that country for almost exactly a century), but it is nonsense  nothing was said and nothing happened  so its the biggest, least flavorful nothing-burger yet.
Donald Trump has the strength and weakness of a successful revolutionary; they took the Republican nomination by popular vote from the outside and took over the leadership of a party and headship of a government that are largely hostile to him. The administration is still infested with Democrats, though the diluvian leakage seems to have been partially stanched by repeated threats of prosecution.
The Republican leaders in the Congress dont like Mr. Trump, and they are fairly contemptuous of them, as part of the rotten system they assaulted, and they are losers to boot. But now they know they have to do something, hold their noses and deliver, or they go, at least as majorities, and the ineffable commander-in-chief drives on, like a New York developer dealing with new city councilors.
When the Comey uproar occurred, Speaker Paul Ryan would not prejudge whether the president was guilty of something. They couldnt get their health-care bill out of the House without the president, and this was the best they could do. When the Russian meeting came to light, even Representative Trey Gowdy, a fairly impressive partisan at times, left matters of criminality to Bob Mueller.
Truly, such a feckless lot of sheep deserves to be rescued from the wrath of the voters only when one considers the possible primacy at the Capitol of Schumer, Pelosi, Schiff, Warner, and Kaine, at which point all sensibilities and grievances are soothed by a balm of Gilead, in this case a cold terror of what the Democrats could do if they had more than the little power to obstruct and defame that they are now wielding.
The Democratic party and the U.S. Congress have been reduced to an oceanic depth of imbecility.
Unless they have taken complete leave of their senses, the congressional Republicans will finally repeal Obamacare, resign themselves to working with the president, and build steadily through the spring on the heavy waiting agenda. Economic growth has begun in anticipation of the tax changes that are promised. And the country supports the repulse of the eco-extremists who were going to save the planet at Paris by graciously imposing poverty on America for the benefit of foreign workers.
Illegal immigration, unsustainably high foreign-energy imports, enthroned political correctness, the tyranny of the teachers and other public-service unions, the 25-year failure of policy toward North Korea, and the appeasement of the nations enemies are all ending. The jackal press, who after the departure from Washington of the Bushes, Clintons, and Obamas are the most visible breakers on the [great American swamp] white with foam, will not be able to restrain the flow of public support to the administration after the congressional Republicans puzzle out that pouting in silence while holding their noses and smiling is better than continued gridlock and death at the polls.
Senator McConnell, who was going to drop [candidate Trump] like a hot rock 18 months ago, and who is not only the husband of a cabinet secretary but probably the shrewdest Senate leader (except perhaps for Bob Dole) since Lyndon Johnson, will lead their fellow Republican legislators forward by the light of the grace of conversion (to the virtues of incumbency).
Mr. Mueller and their selected Democratic inquisitors can do as they will; collusion and obstruction are dead pigeons, and this ludicrous farce will only be a memory when the legislators return after Labor Day.

And this: the pageantry of the All-Star Game and the feats of strength of the Home Run Derby. And there'll be the drama of postseason baseball available there, too.
LAS VEGAS -- To the wonders of China, add this: Bryce Harper and Mike Trout, Clayton Kershaw and Dallas Keuchel.
LAS VEGAS -- To the wonders of China, add this: Bryce Harper and Mike Trout, Clayton Kershaw and Dallas Keuchel.
And this: the pageantry of the All-Star Game and the feats of strength of the Home Run Derby. And there'll be the drama of postseason baseball available there, too.
Major League Baseball extended its reach in a huge way on Wednesday with the announcement of a three-year deal to live stream 125 games and an array of other programming into mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau beginning this month.
Le Sports -- a Chinese internet-based sport, content and communications company -- will have exclusive rights to the programming. The announcement was made jointly by Major League Baseball and Le Sports.
"This is a perfect partnership," Commissioner Rob Manfred said. "We believe the key to continued internalization is localization. We need great partners, and Le Sports is that kind of partner."
Le Sport's baseball coverage will be available across an array of platforms and, in addition to games, will include studio programming and online communities for all 30 MLB clubs.
"Baseball is a sport of 'coming home,' which matches our traditional Chinese family values perfectly," Le Sports chairperson Fei Gao said. "MLB has focused on working through local education and communities to influence more youth to play baseball. We will provide an enhanced viewing experience to Chinese fans, and encourage more families and young people to play and enjoy this amazing sport. I am excited to join forces with MLB. We also will work with MLB to provide fans with events, merchandise and other opportunities to enhance their enjoyment of baseball."
Baseball has had an office in Beijing since 2007 and has emphasized growing baseball at the grassroots level across the country through an assortment of programs at both the youth and university level. Those programs celebrated a milestone last summer when 19-year-old infielder Itchy Xu was signed by the Baltimore Orioles.
"China is a crucial frontier for the development of baseball," Manfred said. "Our new, prominent place on Le Sports platforms both reaffirms and expands our commitment to growing the game in China."
MLB has programs in almost 100 elementary schools in five Chinese cities with an estimated 600,000 kids having participated. MLB's traveling exhibit draws more than 3.5 million participants.
Now comes a plan to live stream four games a week in addition to the the World Series and playoffs, All-Star Game and Home Run Derby.
"By working with MLB in China over the past three years on events, we saw just how appealing the league is to Chinese families, and how popular the games and MLB players have become to young sports fans in China," Le Sports CEO Zhenjian Lei said. "We are excited to expand and extend our partnership with MLB."
Eric Mika, senior vice president of LeTV, a division of Le Sports, said the deal had the potential to create "millions of new fans."
They thought it could do something more, too.
"If ping pong brought China and America closer together, imagine what baseball will do," they said. "Business can do good while also doing good business."
In 2008, the Padres and Dodgers played two exhibition games, a first for China and MLB. As the sport grows, baseball officials envision more games, more clinics, more of everything.
"Over the last decade, MLB has worked steadily to lay a lasting foundation for baseball in China," MLB chief operating officer Tony Petitti said. "We have made remarkable progress developing uniquely Chinese baseball content, enriching the curricula of local schools, and mentoring the first generation of top-flight homegrown players. This partnership is an encouraging inflection point in the story of MLB China. Le Sports is an invaluable media platform for global sports brands and will enhance all aspects of our presence in China."
The site is the largest of Amazon's four UK centres
A contractor is in hospital after falling through four floors at Swansea warehouse of online retailer Amazon.
The man had fallen through floorboards on the fourth floor and continued to fall through flooring until they landed on the ground floor.
The warehouse, which opened in 2008, covers an area the size of 10 football pitches and is the company's largest UK distribution centre.
Police said the Heath and Safety Executive was investigating.
The ambulance service confirmed that the man was taken to Morriston Hospital shortly after 1230 BST on Wednesday and that their injuries were not life-threatening.
An Amazon spokesperson said: "An incident occurred earlier today (Wednesday), whilst work was being undertaken by external specialist contractors to construct additional product storage capacity at our fulfilment centre.
"A worker employed by the contractor suffered injuries and was taken to hospital.
"We are working with the contactor to ensure that the incident is fully investigated."
COMMERCIAL FEATURE Director of Education at New Struan School, JimTaylor, explains why children and young people with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can flourish in a dedicated and specially designed environment.
Click on the icon above to view the video of New Struan School
Autism is a lifelong developmental condition which affects the way a person communicates, interacts and views the world around them. The autism spectrum refers to the range of ways the condition actually manifests in the individual which can vary greatly from person to person and throughout their life. While some people will have more subtle difficulties, others will have complex needs requiring more intensive support.
The behaviours and challenges typically associated with autism are often as a result of differences in thinking, processing and perception.
New Struan School, situated in Clackmannanshire in the heart of Scotland, is a pioneering leader in this field, offering up to 42 pupils aged 5-19 an education tailored specifically to their needs. Established over 35 years ago, the school has a staff team equipped with a true understanding of autism and the experience and vision to enable young people to learn and develop. Once they are set on the right path at New Struan, they can make achievements and progress that might have seemed impossible before.
The cornerstone of this most forward thinking of specialist schools is a setting which is specifically designed, both architecturally and in its teaching methods to address solely the needs of children with autism which are distinct from any other group. The staff develop a deep understanding of each individual and their autism in order to identify strategies to overcome the barriers to learning. Looking beyond the immediate ‘behaviour' of a young person, the staff are skilled at recognising the unique thinking and communication patterns of each pupil and develop teaching methods accordingly which take into account the individual's communication abilities, strengths and motivations enabling them to learn and flourish at school.
New Struan School offers day and residential places and currently has availability. Watch the video here and for further information go to www.newstruanschool.org or contact the school direct on 01259 222 000 or newstruan@scottishautism.org
Anyone needing further information about Autism Spectrum Disorders should go to the very comprehensive Scottish Autism website www.scottishautism.org which includes helpline and support details.
Omar Jadwat, the director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, represented the plaintiffs in the arguments. They frustrated some of the court's judges at first by not giving clear answers on whether the order was facially legitimate, which could allow it to survive under the Mandel standard. But they later broadly rejected the idea that Trump's order should be upheld on such a low judicial threshold. “Deference cannot be a license to violate the Establishment Clause,” they told the judges, referring to the First Amendment clause restricting the state's ability to institutionalize religion.
The case challenged the president's second iteration of the executive order, which temporarily barred visa travel from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspended the U.S. Refugee Assistance Program for 120 days. The order constituted a revision of a January 27 directive that banned travel from seven total countries, permanently banned Syrian refugees, and included an exemption for religious minorities. That order's sudden implementation on a Friday night led to chaos at major American airports as foreign travelers permitted to enter the United States upon takeoff were blocked by the time they touched down.
After a three-judge panel in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a nationwide injunction blocking the order in February, the Trump administration backed down and issued a more narrowly tailored version in March. But the second version has still struggled in the courts. Judge Theodore Chuang, a federal district-court judge in Maryland, issued a preliminary injunction blocking its enforcement a few hours after it was supposed to go into effect on March 16. Justice Department lawyers had argued that the March order's revisions addressed concerns by multiple federal courts about the first order's scope and constitutionality.
Chuang ruled against them, citing public comments by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who said that “the principles of the [second] executive order remain the same” as the first, and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who told Fox News that Trump had asked them for help on how to create a Muslim ban that would pass legal muster.
“The second executive order does not explain specifically why this extraordinary, unprecedented action is the necessary response to the existing risks,” they wrote. “But while the travel ban bears no resemblance to any response to a national-security risk in recent history, it bears a clear resemblance to the precise action that President Trump described as effectuating their Muslim ban.”
A Justice Department appeal challenging Chuang's injunction would typically be heard by a three-judge panel in the Fourth Circuit. But the circuit's judges voted last month to hear the case in an en banc panel, a rare procedural maneuver that places the case for consideration before the court's full 15-judge bench. (Thirteen of the judges heard the case on Monday after two of their colleagues recused themselves.)

IN politics as in religion, honest doubt is often more interesting than dogmatic certainty.
As people shout their certainties about how we should vote in the referendum, my doubts may be of some help to the large number of Scots who are still in the "don't know" camp.
First, I have to explain where I'm coming from – geographically and politically. I came from London to make my home in Glasgow 34 years ago and intend to stay here until my dying day, whatever happens about independence.
I joined the Labour Party as a student in 1947, and have stayed with them since – apart from a break of some years following our entry into the Iraq war.
You may have marched with me when 80,000 of us carried this newspaper group's placards through Glasgow saying, “Not in my name”.
I've always believed that the most important question facing Scotland – independent or not – is whether we can enable people living in the UK's greatest concentrations of poverty – mainly around the Clyde – to enter our society's mainstream and gain the opportunities every Scot should have.
Is Glasgow to belong to Scotland or not?
I used to think we'd stand a better chance of getting the right answer to that question if we stay in the UK with the resources of the whole island to help us.
But I'm no longer sure that the rest of the UK has much interest in the question.
When I joined the party in 1947, most people worked with their hands. If the party could gain their support, they would win elections. Since Labour had been created by their trade unions, their co-ops and socialist groups, that was always possible. But those days are long past.
The party now have to convince all sorts of people – different classes, races, religions and ages in different regions of the country – that their cause is just. If they only pander to prejudices of swing voters in a few marginal constituencies (all in the midlands and south of England, and more likely to read the right wing press than papers such as this one), then radical politics will die.
That is what is happening.
I know all the arguments against independence and most of them are sound.
I believe the biggest problems my grandchildren will face – world poverty, climate change, terrorism – have to be tackled through closer collaboration between nations.
Creating new, small nations distracts us from that. But it looks increasingly as if staying in the UK means we shall leave the European Union – the world's biggest political achievement in centuries.
Labour leader Ed Miliband, if they win the next Westminster election, has not yet promised a referendum on that. But neither has they refused one. Nor has they made a fighting case for the EU.
We seem likely to be living in a country that continues to impose increasingly punitive and humiliating sanctions on its poorest citizens who have to live on social security benefits.
Labour seem determined to show they will match the Tories' brutalities.
The Human Rights Act – a great achievement – may be repealed; as our present Home Secretary threatens.
We may continue living under the most centralised government in the Western world – strangling local government and killing off independent civic leadership.
Green policies may be dropped or downgraded. It's already happening.
And our armed forces seem likely to be fighting wars, not in our name but as mercenary outriders of American foreign policy.
“Labour”, you may say, “will change all that”.
I wish I could believe you.
Their leaders may want to reverse these trends but if they do not go out and fight for these causes, they won't be able to.
They no longer have the support of movements and social classes that instinctively trust them. But they do have powerful enemies determined to challenge and discredit them.
If this is the way the UK is really heading, I would rather get out, whatever the hazards of independence.
Looking still further ahead, we have to recognise that a vote for independence – or even a narrow rejection of it – will pose difficult questions for people living in Northern Ireland, Wales, and even the north of England.
There will be others hoping to follow in our footsteps.
The referendum will not be the end of this story. It may lead us into the endgame of the United Kingdom.

Post subject: The Official Release of Lucid 5.25 (Lucid Five Twenty-Five)
Subject description: The Most Leading-Edge Lucid Ever Posted: Tue 22 Feb 2011, 21:00Post subject:The Official Release of Lucid 5.25 (Lucid Five Twenty-Five)Subject description: The Most Leading-Edge Lucid Ever This is the Official Release of Lucid Puppy 5.2.5.
Lucid Five Twenty-Five
A Five Digit Update from Lucid 5.2
The Ultimate Expression of the Lucid Vision
IMHO, Lucid 5.2.5 is probably not the best choice for AMD K6, because some programs in Lucid 5.2.5 are not compatible with K6. Lucid 5.1.1 would be a better choice--not that 4.3.1 is not perfectly good also.
Instant Update 001 for Lucid Puppy 5.2.5 (known as the Bigpup Update) ->
http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/puppylinux/pet-packages-lucid/Lucid525-InstantUpdate-001.pet
The update
--> fixes Bootflash which did not work in the release of Lucid 5.2.5
--> fixes xgamma-gui which did not work in the release of Lucid 5.2.5
--> updates Psync to be aware of both UTC and local system time
--> updates Firewallstate to leave program icon off on reboot when turned off
--> adds report-video-glx which might be a useful standard for diagnosing video issues
--> adds ffconvert to convert between video formats
--> updates the Lupu PPM in Puppy Package Manager
--> links Help to LupuNews Help
The pet is 132KB.

Lucid Puppy 5.25 is the most leading-edge Lucid ever. It has Bash 4.1.0, Syslinux 4.03, and e2fsprogs 1.41.14, the latest from Ubuntu Natty. It now has JWM 500, up from 493. Gnumeric 1.10.13 is a necessity because our very own yarddog had posted a bug to Gnumeric that is corrected in 1.0.13. Lucid 5.25 uses the Woof of FEB 28 replacing the Woof of NOV 28 for 3 months of progress in Woof development. All of the favorite Puppy programs are there in their latest versions. Check out Pburn by zigbert which now compares favorably with Nero Linux. Gnome-mplayer 1.02 compiled by our own ttuuxxx is a substantial improvement and now works well with both the Openbox and JWM window managers. All this and the the low overhead that makes Puppy fast and the friendliness that makes it fun.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lucid Puppy 5.2.5
Very few changes
-> Rox slowdown issue fixed (01micko and others)
-> 2 menu item duplicates (Sylpheed and Iron)
-> Quickpet Iron
-> Stay-Connected added
Lupu-521 RC aka Release What You Tested
Very few changes
-> back to flashplayer 10.2.153.1 by forum feedback
-> back to DejaVu Sans desktop font by forum feedback, but Liberation are still installed and available
-> back to original udev because the updates seemed to be associated with network dropouts
-> latest BaCon in Devx to make Barry happy - runtime libhug in iso
-> i915.modeset version 2 by rerwin
-> considerable work on devx
Luci-257 aka Better Safe than Sorry
-> guvcview back to 1.4.4
-> /usr/lib/gconv/IBM850.so
-> Quickset (firstrun) message about setting UTF-8
-> udev-151 from Ubuntu Lucid Updates cut down to file with Barry's udev-124 (which it replaces)
-> udev_lib-151 updated from Lucid Updates
-> 2 barks is enough - code snippet to stop barks if necessary
-> Liberation fonts properly installed (thanks to 01micko) and set as default
Testing:
1. udev has to do with hardware detection and configuration (sound, modems, usb, etc.) : Does udev-151 and the updated libraries solve any problems (or create any)?
If you have a problem and this doesn't solve it, please download the udev-full-151 and install that and reboot. Any help?
http://diddywahdiddy.net/Puppy500/udev_151-12.3_i386.deb
2. Do you prefer Liberation Sans fonts (current default) or Deja Vu Sans fonts (previous default)?
3. The usual basics: Are sound, video, etc., properly set up? Do the programs work?
(I changed the name of luci_devx_251 to 257 I hope that doesn't mess up the md5sum--I don't know.)
Delta file.......
http://diddywahdiddy.net/Puppy500/luci-256.iso___luci-257.iso.delta
562da9fe66784cc7a6fd806351cdec05
Luci-256
-> symlinks to libssl and libcrypto 0.9.7
-> PupControl program defaults added
-> latest Quickpet 4.2
-> rules to distinguish between different Intel 845 video chipsets (rerwin)
-> rt2800usb fix from tempestuous
-> Flashplayer reverted to 10.1r102
In testing, upgrades from the previous luci version are not the most important thing now--most testing should be done pfix=ram. And then at the end we will test upgrading Lucid 5.2. Please test Audio, Video (especially Intel video), and modems, and everything else.
Luci-254 is Ready and Waiting
Issues found and fixed since luci-253
-> wget, ssh issue - fixed by using openssl 0.9.8o, an update from 0.9.8k
-> Aide Abiword - duplicate Abiword listing in languages other than English and now French - same listing for program and for Help
-> /root/.history not being written - fixed with bash 4.1.0
-> gnome-mplayer crashing Google Earth - fixed with gnome-mplayer 1.0.2
-> gnome-mplayer 1.0.2 icons - fixed by 01micko
-> gnome-mplayer full screen problem with jwm - fixed with 1.0.2
-> caught localization problem (petget) - petget uses a technique that wipes localization - commented it out
-> include backgrounds from 5.2 to prevent missing background error on upgrade
-> Update PupRadio 0.8, JWM Thememaker 1.5, Pburn 3.3.4
-> PupControl 1.4.1
-> Guvcview 1.4.4 replacing Luvcview
Luci-254 is the most leading-edge Lucid ever. It has Bash 4.1.0 , an upgrade from Bash 3, Syslinux 4.03 , an upgrade from Syslinux 3, and e2fsprogs 1.41.14 , the latest from Ubuntu Natty. It also has all of the updated Puppy programs and the Ubuntu binaries listed below. It now has JWM 500 , up from 493.
We got Gnumeric 1.10.13 (up from 1.10.12 in 5.2) because our very own yarddog had posted a bug to Gnumeric that is corrected in 1.0.13.
It uses the Woof of FEB 28 replacing Woof of FEB 22 which replaced the Woof of NOV 28. This is the Woof we will stay with because in the next one Barry has merged the zzz-Utilities.
Notes
libpython has been added to the devx (and to the Python in PPM). integer.pm has been added to perl. With Syslinux 4, I was able to install Puppy and boot a usb flash disk with ext4. pcdripper was not starting properly and I removed it. Asunder works. Icons in jwm menu work. Sound is persistent. jwm background works. jwm500 now has the correct support files from 01micko.
I think I have fixed the issues reported previously.

A further dramatic aspect of the General election was when Andrew Withers – once treasurer of LPUK – resigned their role of leader within 24 hours of the polls opening, effective at the next AGM. This sounds mad, but for someone with such a toxic history it made electoral and practical sense. In fact it is the best thing they ever did.
With Andrew Withers set to go there is a possibility that their party may become a useful institution, one to be approached with caution at first but ultimately supportable and one day, I hope, electable. Whether that happens will depend on bright diligent people taking the helm and moving things forward. Part of moving forward will to be reconciled with the past and to make amends to the activists who were mistreated. However, I had given up on all that and now I have some catching up to do.
It seems that one of the ways to reconcile with the past would be to make a statement in the public accounts, acknowledging that prior statements of income and expenditure implied a cash position that was materially different from the real position. In fact, that short sentence – above a signature – would be a real help as it would be an official acknowledgment that expenditure had not been accounted for (which it had not). Before banging the drum for such a statement, I thought it wise to check one had not already been made. The answer? Well it has and it hasn't.
The documents LPUK uploaded did not make any comment on the problem. They did not even state a bank balance, but lo! What is this? In the metadata attached to the documents for 2012 and 2013 someone has supplied a value for “cash at bank and in hand”, would it be possible to trace through all the filings and find out how large the accounting discrepancy had been? Since there has not been a restatement it made sense that it would.
This is the data I collected, I have not tried to account for loans but the party only declared £580 of loans:
My formulas are highlighted yellow, white cells contain transcribed values. The Calculated Balance is simply the sum of money earned and spent. In the two years where a bank balance is declared the discrepancy is a steady £4098.44. So, finally, the party has essentially admitted – by stating contradictory numbers – that it's accounts do not contain all the transactions that occurred, or else contain incorrect ones. The problem will have occurred between 2007 and 2010, a period in which Andrew Withers was, for the largest part, the treasurer.
The amount is small in national terms, but relative to the individual contributor it is huge, and of great importance. It was 27.9% of peak income and it is now equivalent to four times current income, after members fled. This is important because in order to continue trading the LPUK must attract a steady flow of donations. If you were donating £100 now, what percentage of that money is at risk? If as an activist, you attract 100 new members to the party, how many will end up angry frustrated and betrayed, rather than represented empowered and enabled? Why should anyone pay LPUK cash, or even any attention, unless and until it acknowledges the seriousness of the problem faced by its supporters?
But who do we expect to acknowledge it? The way this information was disclosed matches exactly the controversial loan that landed Andrew in hot water in the first place. That loan was mentioned to the chairperson Nic Coome within earshot of half the NCC and a cluster of activists, myself included. But it was skipped over lightly and Andrew ploughed on with the conversation, not giving anyone time to digest what they heard – keeping the NCC informed but effectively ignorant. Placing the bank balance on an obscure website while the only careful critic of the party had moved onto getting married and having babies is directly from that playbook. So expecting Andrew Withers to redeem themselves is false hope.
What about the now-treasurer Nic Coome? It would (should) have been them who uploaded the data to the Electoral Commission. I can only assume that they have done so honestly and accurately with respect to the current figures and the forms in front of him. The strange pivot table format of their documents show a keeness to reconcile practical reality with the priorities of the Electoral Commission, this is the behavior of an honest actor. But what of the Treasurer's duty to the members and to the public? The figures lodged with the Electoral Commission, over time, have contradicted each other. Nic was well aware of the potential for that since they were involved in my prior investigation into the balances and they had a duty to publicly acknowledge the discrepancy. Imagine if Tesco, who recently restated their finances, had simply announced contradictory numbers and left the contradiction to be discovered by journalists? As it is the Serious Fraud Office are investigating Tesco.
Nic is a close ally of Andrew Withers and they have let that closeness affect their judgement. The accounts 2012 accounts should have been accompanied with an apology. Instead they resorted to the kind of tactics libertarians criticise in others, of trying to bury bad news. The original problem which allowed four thousand pounds to be mislaid was a resigning matter for Andrew Withers, now Nic Coome has added a further shameful chapter to that story yet both are still in office.
The sooner libertarians in the UK give up on LPUK, and take their Facebook likes elsewhere, the sooner the impersonal cruelty of our current political system will end. The figures currently bed-blocking at the top of this party are a part of the nation's problem.

Notorious: The park's rides are less extreme now – but still far from tame (Picture: Action Park)
Action Park in New Jersey, a pleasure ground where six people died and hundreds more were injured, has reopened after nearly 20 years.
The 35-acre theme park, where a trip down a water slide could almost as likely land you in the hospital as the pool, closed its doors in 1996 amid media criticism and lawsuits.
However, a 2013 viral video called The Most Insane Amusement Park Ever inspired owners to bring it back.
Dubbed ‘Class Action Park' because of the barrage of lawsuits it received, the original park would sometimes average five to 10 injuries each day – but that was just how visitors liked it.
Original rides included Alpine Slide, where riders would fly down a concrete track in a car with just a handbrake, while some people's horror stories didn't make it sound like the most amusing of parks…

‘I was there three times when I was 9 or 10 – twice I left in an ambulance,' said one former attendee.
‘The first time was broken ribs on the ‘Tarzan Swing' (my dad had to jump into the water to save me) and next was the alpine slide, when my car had no brakes and I flew over the side and into the grass. I then had to walk the whole way down crying and dripping blood.

‘They kept sending us free passes to go back so we went again but I was extremely cautious and only went on one ride – a kayak where you simply paddled around a sort of lazy river. I loved it and it was safe but the next day the ride was closed because someone fell off their kayak and was electrocuted by the electric currents.
‘Never went back again – too afraid.'

The owner claims it's still far from tame, too.
While the new park has a few modifications to appease health and safety, it retains some of the lawlessness of its 1970s heyday, with alcohol permitted and ‘I Survived Action Park' T-shirts for sale.

‘The overall conclusion that the people who went to Action Park have been that it was a phenomenal place,' owner Andy Mulvihill, son of the park's founder Gene, told the New York Post.

A top London publisher today declared that the era of the celebrity memoir, a Christmas present favourite, has peaked.
Charlie Redmayne, UK chief executive of HarperCollins, has dramatically cut back on the number of expensive stars they are buying up.
They said such non-fiction celebrity titles had proved “risky” because publishers have to pay a big advance and yet many of the titles turned out to be “unprofitable” and had a short shelf life.
“We're moving away from big celebrity hit-and-miss stuff,” they said. Their comments were backed up by a report in The Bookseller magazine which said sales of biographies and autobiographies have fallen nearly four per cent this year, according to Nielsen BookScan data.
Mr Redmayne, the older half-brother of actor Eddie Redmayne, declined to identify any celebrity authors that have been a disappointment. But memoirs by US presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and comic John Bishop are among those that have notched up lacklustre sales. Pippa Middleton's party-planning book was also a notable flop.
Mr Redmayne — who took charge of Rupert Murdoch's HarperCollins last year — was speaking as annual accounts showed revenues fell nearly six per cent to £180 million in the year to June.
They said part of the reason for the fall in revenue was their “strategic decision” to pull back from some “unprofitable” non-fiction publishing and they pointed out that operating profits rose 80 per cent to £5 million.
“I felt the company had embraced some quite risky celebrity non-fiction. A lot of these books were hugely expensive and they were not necessarily going to back-list well,” they said, referring to sales after the initial launch.
“You'd have three weeks of sales and then it would be gone. I'm looking to publish books that have longevity that will sell in the front list but will also form a back list.”
They stressed there was still a market for celebrity memoirs, pointing to Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography, which sold nearly 700,000 copies.
But Patrick Neale, owner of Jaffe and Neale's bookshop in Oxfordshire, told the Bookseller: “I have always asked when the bubble is going to burst on celebrity titles and to date I have been proved wrong, but actually this might be the year it has finally happened. Sales of Stephen Fry and Michael Palin books have been low, which is surprising.”
This year's surprise Christmas hit has been Girl Online, a novel by Zoella video blogger Zoe Sugg, who has admitted they had “help” writing the book.
Silipint Silicone Pint Glass
Beer may come in a bottle or a can but it's best enjoyed out of a glass. Pouring it in a glass and letting it breath lets the aroma out and lets you enjoy the color and aroma of your brew before you sip and enjoy it. The only downside to glass is that it does break. We've all broken a glass at some point in time. Often it's that favorite glass from a special trip to your favorite brewery. Worry no more.
The Silipint is the world's first silicone pint glass. It's unbreakable so no more worries about dropping it when you've had a couple too many beverages. Being made of silicone has other advantages too in addition to being unbreakable. It's also keeping your beer nicely insulated from the warmth of your hand, unlike traditional glassware. Being made from 100% food grade FDA approved silicone means there are aromas or flavors from the glass itself to ruin your beer enjoyment. It's also dishwasher and microwave safe. In addition to pint glass sizes with a large number of designs, Silipint also offers custom printing on your pint plus shot glass sizes too. Get them made with your own brewery logo, home bar name, or whatever else you choose. Be sure to follow Silipint here on Twitter. You can grab your very own Silipint silicone pint glass here on their website.
It's not often you see a team take a quarterback in the first round as the Buffalo Bills did in 2013, only to seemingly move on from that player 14 starts into their career. That's what EJ Manuel says happened to him.
They were named the starter right out the gates and after a rocky rookie campaign, they found themselves on the bench in favor of Kyle Orton four games into their second season.
“It was very surprising,” Manuel said of their benching. “You know, obviously being 2-2 and after losing to Houston, [former Bills Head] Coach [Doug] Marrone made the change and it was something I never dealt with as a competitor, as an athlete. So, it was definitely one of those things that I had to humble myself and understand that this could happen to anybody, you know what I mean?”
“It was obviously a turbulent time in my life and in my career and it was only my second year. So, I'm just like wow. (laughter) Sometimes young guys continue to get a chance to grow and fight through those growing pains and I just wasn't afforded that opportunity. I just kind of had to roll with it and just keep rolling.”
For some perspective, let's look at Manuel between their rookie season and their second season (as short as that second season was for him).
As a rookie, Manuel ranked 37th in the league with 197.2 passing yards per game. Their 77.7 passer rating was 7th worst among QB's with at least 300 attempts. They missed 6 games due to injury and was replaced by Thad Lewis. The Bills were 4-6 under Manuel and finished 2-4 under Lewis and Jeff Tuel.
Carr's first ten games, the Raiders went 0-10. And their 76.6 passer rating that season was not only worse than Manuel's, but it was fourth worst in the NFL among QB's with at least 200 attempts.
Manuel, in their 4 starts in 2014 upped their QB rating to 80.3, though their completions dropped slightly from 58.8% to 58%. That was enough to get them benched for veteran Kyle Orton who finished off the season going 7-5 as the starter with a 64.2 completion percentage and an 87.8 passer rating.
Compare that to Carr's second season in which they showed improvement across the board, completing 61.1% of their passes with a QB rating of 91.1. The Raiders also improved by four wins to 7-9. So, while Carr began their career lower, they saw a far more sizable jump their second season.
There are different ways you can look at that. Which is why initially, the move to bench Manuel caused some friction between coaching and management in Buffalo. Marrone opted out of their contract after that season and Rex Ryan took over as head coach. Also out was their QB coach, Todd Downing, who joined Jack Del Rio's staff in Oakland.
Even with a new staff and a clean slate, Manuel never got their starting job back. Tyrod Taylor was brought in, won the starting job and has not relinquished it, putting up two seasons throwing for over 3000 yards each along with a combined 37 touchdown passes to 12 interceptions.
Downing continued to remain in contact with Manuel the past couple years. The two's relationship goes back to before Downing joining the Bills as QB coach in 2014. That bond was something Manuel said meant a great deal to them and was a major factor in their signing with the Raiders.
“He meant a lot,” Manuel said of Downing. “We first worked together in the Senior Bowl. Just from those conversations when I was 21, obviously not knowing what to expect from the NFL and the opportunity that lay ahead of me, just having that trust and that kind of open mode of communication relationship from them back then.”
“I was extremely happy when they signed on with us in Buffalo. I was really excited to work with them and learn from them and get some of their wisdom and knowledge. Obviously, that was cut short with the circumstances in Buffalo, but the fact that they were out here, they would still reach out and say, ‘How am I doing?' It was never really more so about football. It was more so just about me as a person. That's something that is very rare in this business.”
“When they did call once free agency began and told me that [the Raiders] were interested, for me it was a no-brainer. That's a situation you want. Especially as a quarterback and in my situation, trying to really change the perception of whatever I've gone through in Buffalo and all that kind of stuff. I know the player I can be and so does coach Downing. That's what I'm excited about.”
There is no doubt this marriage was a smart one for both parties. In Manuel, Downing gets someone who is familiar with him, and as a new offensive coordinator, that's important. In Downing, Manuel gets someone who has believed in their abilities since even before they joined the league and will therefore give them a fair shot.
Obviously Manuel isn't here to be the starter or even compete for that job. That belongs to Derek Carr. Manuel understands that and is satisfied with their role in Oakland.
“However I can help them (Carr), I'm willing to do, but of course I'm here to compete for the number two job,” said Manuel.
“I just want to be an addition. I'm not an ego guy and all that kind of stuff. I'm not driven by that. Obviously, as a player you're very prideful in yourself, but I'm about the team. I want the team to get better. I want to be here to help this franchise and team to be where they are in whatever role or capacity that is. That's what I'm excited to do.”
Manuel will compete with second year quarterback Connor Cook, who the team selected in the the top of the 4th round in last year's draft. Cook made their first ever start in the team's wild card playoff game against the Texans due to injuries to Carr and primary backup, Matt McGloin who is departing as a free agent.
Carr, like Manuel, was a starter from day one. From there, the two's careers went in different directions. Manuel is hoping they can prove they were worth the shot Carr was given in Oakland, only this time as a backup without the pressure of carrying a franchise.
Sooner or later, the robot uprising and the ultimate downfall of man will be upon us. Or, at least, that's how robot doomsayers tell it.
As the technology stands right now, that's not a reality we're living through, but the impact of robots on people's everyday lives is set to increase at what you might consider an alarming rate.
Pepper the robot, one of the smartest AI creations on the market today, is capable of recognizing human facial expressions and interacting with them accordingly. It's because of this that Pepper has found use as a ‘companion' robot for elderly people and children, primarily.
Now, however, Pepper is being trialled as a receptionist in two Belgian hospitals, offering the first insight of how it fares in a dedicated healthcare environment.
While Softbank has been making Pepper in batches of 1,000 for less than $2,000 each, that's not quite the same model that will be gracing the reception desks in those hospitals. Instead, that's an upgraded $34,000 model, according to the BBC.
Among Pepper's special abilities is its understanding of 20 different languages, and being able whether its talking to a man, woman or child.
According to the Beeb, in one hospital, Pepper will remain in reception, but in another trial location, he'll be accompanying visitors to other departments and wards. Meanwhile in Singapore, Pepper's been employed to take food orders at some speciality Pizza Hut stores.
The future is very nearly here, people.

A Theory of tDCS (“Gross oversimplification”) As positive current flows into the cortex it passes neurons.
Because of the nature of neurons, this positive current depolarizes somas (cell's body), increasing excitability, thereby increasing the functionality & plasticity of that region (hypothesis… “We really don't know.”). Under the cathode, somas (cells) are being hyper-polarized – excitabilty decreases.

IN A revelation that could shatter Hillary Clinton's bid for the White House, former President Bill Clinton once admitted they aren't the biological father of the couple's only child – daughter Chelsea!
That's the explosive claim of former Clinton aide Larry Nichols – who further claims that Bill confirmed long-standing rumors that Chelsea's real dad is Webster Hubbell, Hillary's former law partner in Little Rock, Ark.!
As Hillary prepares to announce whether she'll seek the 2016 presidential nomination, the “love child” scandal centering on 34-year-old Chelsea – now pregnant with investment banker-husband Marc Mezvinsky, 36 – has been slowly building traction. A June 2 report in “The New Yorker” referenced the rumors, citing claims made by anti-Clinton blogger Robert Morrow. A week later, another national magazine questioned whether Hillary was “hiding (a) bombshell paternity scandal.”
To get to the bottom of the charges, The National ENQUIRER tracked down Larry, who began working for Bill when they were Arkansas governor. The 63-year-old ex-Clinton confidante told The ENQUIRER that Bill dropped the paternity bombshell during a conversation the two were having at the Arkansas Governor's Mansion. They say it took place in 1984, Bill's second term in office. At the time, there were rumors that hound-dog Bill – who later confessed to several affairs, including those with Gennifer Flowers and Monica Lewinsky – had impregnated a local woman.
“We were discussing this woman's claims that Bill had knocked them up and what we should do about it,” said Larry. “But they denied that they could have gotten them pregnant. They said they had measles as a kid and that rendered them sterile! “His exact words were, ‘I shoot blanks.'
“Stunned by what I'd just heard, I asked him, ‘Then what about Chelsea?'
And they said, ‘Oh, Webb (Hubbell) sired her,'” referring to Hillary's Rose Law Firm colleague, once a close Clinton family friend.
Chelsea was born on Feb. 27, 1980.
Now, more than three decades later, the allegations about their paternity may be turned against Hillary. Blogger Morrow told The ENQUIRER that he's reporting the love child scandal because it raises “character questions about Hillary” if they run again for the nation's highest office.
“Chelsea is a dead ringer for Webb,” they said. “But Hillary initially kept the pregnancy secret from Bill! “If your wife becomes pregnant, the husband is usually the second person to know. But I find it very odd that Bill initially didn't find out about their wife becoming pregnant – and had to learn that fact from a newspaper! “
According to well-respected author Edward Klein's (2005) book, ‘The Truth about Hillary,' Bill discovered their wife was pregnant by reading it in the ‘Arkansas Gazette.' “It's unfortunate, sad really, that Chelsea has no real relationship with Webb – who I believe to be their real biological father – when he's alive and kicking and living in North Carolina.
“But it could be she's in denial, despite overwhelming proof that Webb is their real dad.”
Seven years before Chelsea's birth, the former First Lady, now 66, met Hubbell, also 66, when they were taking exams to get their licenses to practice law in 1973.
After becoming a partner in the law firm, Hubbell served as mayor of Little Rock. In 1984, four years after Chelsea's birth, then- Gov. Clinton appointed Hubbell as Chief Justice of the Arkansas State Supreme Court. But the married lawyer was forced to resign in 1994 and later pleaded guilty to federal mail fraud and tax evasion for overbilling clients. They served 15 months of a 21-month sentence. Hubbell, who has since battled medical problems, has reportedly kept in touch with Bill. They and their wife Suzy live in Charlotte, N.C., and are parents to four children. They just released their first novel, a political thriller, ironically titled “When Men Betray.”
In a book they wrote in 1997, titled “Friends in High Places,” Hubbell mentions Chelsea with apparent affection. They write: “On summer evenings, I could sip a drink in my big living room and look out at children – including the Fosters' and the Clintons', when Chelsea got big enough – bouncing happily on a trampoline…. Such a scene made me feel successful.” Hubbell did not respond to comment requests made by The ENQUIRER.
But Larry pointed out that Bill was a wonderful “father” to Chelsea. “Whatever Chelsea does or doesn't know about their paternity, I'm sure they consider Bill their real dad – despite there being no blood ties,” Larry added. “I saw firsthand what a doting, loving father they were to their little girl. They always treated them as if they were their own – which in their heart I believe she's always been – from day one.”
Leave it to retailers to jump the gun and possibly spoil the surprise.
As some of you might know, Microsoft has made a committment to furthering its backwards compatibility with the XBox One, bringing not only XBox 360 games to their current console, but also games from the original XBox. Well, a Twitter user by the name of “GamerTagstic” scored a surprise when they happened upon Gamespot's listing of original XBox backward compatible games.
Included in the leaks were Ninja Gaiden Black and Ninja Gaiden, The Punisher, Mortal Kombat Deception, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Doom 3 and its expansion, Resurrection of Evil, and Darkwatch.
Seeing as Gamescom is in full swing, and Microsoft is expected to officially announce their backwards compatibility efforts at the event, these leaks are more than likely the real deal.

In Other Worlds by Margaret Atwood

Future Tense explores the ways emerging technologies affect society, policy, and culture. To read more, visit the Future Tense blog and the Future Tense home page. You can also follow us on Twitter.
The workout my credit card gets at Amazon is structured so I won't get repetition fatigue: I keep my reading list balanced between the highbrow and low, the fiction and non, the popular and the below-the-radar, the new and the old. Yet there is one realm I have long neglected: science fiction. Despite a youthful binge in Arthur C. Clarke, particularly the Rama books, I disdained science fiction for many years, considering it too short on humanity and too long on pointless technical specs.
But I have discovered the error of my snobby ways and am I embarking on a science-fiction education. Perhaps the greatest surprise of this journey is my newfound love for all novels post-apocalyptic. The second-greatest has been that I was already well-acquainted with some “science fiction” that I had not considered such, namely Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. Soon I devoured their cautionary tales of science, capitalism, and societal degeneration, Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood. One of my favorite writers tackling my guilty pleasure of post-apocalyptic fiction buoyed my decision to give sci-fi a try. (Atwood, though, bristles at the label post-apocalyptic: They write: “[I]n a true apocalypse everything on Earth is destroyed, whereas in these two books the only element that's annihilated is the human race, or most of it.”)
Now, with their new work of literary criticism, In Other Worlds: SF and the Human Imagination, Atwood continues to be my sci-fi guide. In Other Worlds is a meditative love letter to science fiction, a scrapbook of decades' work and passion for this divisive genre. Atwood recollects their early reading years, full of unsophisticated novels of space and superheroes; their work in and eventual abandonment of a Ph.D. thesis “The English Metaphorical Romance,” which explored fantasy at a time when it was an ill-regarded genre; their philosophical motivations in writing their speculative novels The Handmaid's Tale, Oryx and Crake, and The Year of the Flood. Atwood also shares a handful of older essays on science fiction, from Nineteen Eighty-Four to Never Let Me Go to the work of Ursula K. Le Guin. We also are treated to a cheerfully scolding open letter to a school district that banned The Handmaid's Tale, ruling it “offensive to Christians.” (“[W]hy are some Christians so quick to see themselves in this mirror?” they ask. The ban has since been overturned.) They tie up In Other Worlds with five short works of their own sci-fi, including one gleaned from their book The Robber Bride. In Other Worlds even contains some illustrations from Atwood, like a kidney surgeon-cum-superhero.
This is an eclectic mix, to be sure, but to Atwood fans and science fiction fans—or, more properly, to Atwood fans who also relish sci-fi—it is a satisfying buffet. To extricate Atwood's thoughts on the genre, its fuzzy borders and its déclassé status, from their own experience in writing and reading it, would be impossible; several of their critical essays open with recollections of the first time they read Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, say, or H. Rider Haggard's 19th-century fantasy novel She, describing why they picked it up, their early impressions, and their later, deeper understanding. In Other Worlds is perhaps best understood as a literary memoir.
Besides their relationship to science fiction, what stands out most are Atwood's dual, and dueling, feelings about the future: They fear what we may do to ourselves and to our planet in the coming decades. Science fiction novels, Atwood writes:
can explore the consequences of new and proposed technologies in graphic ways by showing them as fully operational.… These stories in their darker modes are all versions of “The Sorcerer's Apprentice,” in which the apprentice starts up some of the sorcerer's magic but doesn't know how to turn it off. They may help us decide whether such apprentices could maybe use a little supervision.
So Atwood hopes that through work like hers, and the cautionary tales woven by their fellow-future-travelers, we will avoid or at least consider nasty outcomes from ill-considered deployment of new “advances” like nanotechnology or gene splicing, which figures prominently in the Oryx and Crake. (It is no coincidence that the only nonfiction work discussed at length in In Other Worlds is 2004's Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age, by Bill McKibben.)
A limited-edition version of In Other Worlds comes with an eco-friendly gimmick, or promise, depending on how you look at it: For $100 Canadian, 300 lucky Atwood fans will be able to avoid any eco-guilt, because the extra-special version is printed on paper made partially of straw. A press release quotes Atwood as calling this “the kind of practical innovation that could make paper from endangered forests ancient history.” This “Second Harvest” paper is in short supply, as North America lacks the requisite pulping facilities. Ironically, this “practical innovation” is being distributed unevenly, to those with means, an inequity in the access to new technology with which Atwood seems otherwise uncomfortable; in Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood, for instance, a future society is divided between the wealthy workers who live in secure enclaves controlled by corporations and the have-not “plebe rats” in the crowded, dirty world.
Perhaps the most important guidance Atwood offers on reading and loving science fiction is to respect the craft's ability to explore unintended consequences but not to overstate its predictive qualities: “I carefully say a future rather than the future because the future is an unknown: from the moment now, an infinite number of roads lead away to ‘the future,' each heading in a different direction,” they write. I will cling to those words the next time I read a terrifying depiction of a technologically rich but morally bankrupt society in the years to come. Like the author who's next up in my science fiction education: Neal Stephenson.
Last Year, I unveiled a hockey version of the baseball Marcels forecasting system in an attempt to forecast the future performance of goalies. The idea behind Marcels is simple: we take the last few years of a player's performance and then weight more recent numbers higher than older numbers. In addition, we regress the player's #s to the mean (with a player who has a larger sample being regressed less than one with a smaller sample) and, if we're projecting for the future, we adjust the overall #s for aging. Again, this is a very very basic projecting system, but its' been proven to be incredibly well founded for baseball, and probably for hockey as well.
So let's take a look at how things have changed now that we have data from the most recent season. We now have a few goalies with enough data to run Marcels on that we didn't previously (although barely in most cases) and a few goalies have had large turns in one way or another in their career, which changes the projections.
Again, as a reminder, here is our methodology:
METHODOLOGY (Skip if you just want the results, but it's important)
The earlier post was building upon Eric Tulsky's work which found that the following weights gave the best results at projecting future performance by goalies over the next three years:
So in my base case, I'm using years 1-4 to try to predict years 5-7. The best predictions came from weighting things like this: Each shot faced in year 3 counts 60 percent as much as shots in year 4
Each shot faced in year 2 counts 50 percent as much as shots in year 4
Each shot faced in year 1 counts 30 percent as much as shots in year 4
In addition to the weighting explained above, we are regressing each goalie's #s by adding 1525 shots saved at a league average rate to their sample. And, if we are projecting 3 years in the future, we are adding an aging adjustment, which I have written about Previously.
RESULTS:
Note: The below numbers rely on data through the end of January:
The Key #s above are the Green and Blue Numbers. The Green are the projections of each goalie's save percentage right now, before any aging kicks in. So we project Tuukka Rask to be a .9219 goalie for basically the rest of this season, the best of any goalie in the league. Similarly, we project Ilya Bryzgalov to be a .9073 goalie, which is fairly poor.
If we're projecting further in the future, such as the next three years, we go to the blue column, which takes into account aging. So we basically project Lundqvist to drop substantially below Rask and Price over the next 3 years (down to JUST above average) because he's a few years older.
Note: The Players in italics have their #s regressed over 60% of the way toward league average due to the lack of a good sample size – you can see how much in the rightmost column. So Cam Talbot may project very well, but well, given that we're regressing them over 70% toward the mean, we really aren't projecting them with much certainty (doing things like adding AHL #s in would help here, but that's beyond the simplicity of this exercise).
DISCUSSION:
The #s above speak for themselves, but there are two goalies I'd like to talk about since I think some in the hockey analytics community misanalyze them. The standard method in the analytics community for evaluating a goalie is going by career save percentage. Based on this, Steve Mason (.909 career SV%) is a well below average goalie and Brian Elliott is a little bit below average (.912).
However, both guys' career numbers are so low because they had horrible numbers a number of years ago: Mason had their last terrible season 3 years ago, while Elliott had their last truly awful season 4 years ago (3 years ago was bad, but still well above their previous history). As such, Marcels doesn't think either guy is bad…..
In Fact, Marcels think Mason is basically a just above average goalie these days on the line with guys like Halak, Quick, and Niemi and at 27, he's not due for humongous aging effects. Elliott meanwhile projects as a nearly .920 goalie, 5th best in the league presently (not counting Cam Talbot) and at their age is also likely to stay above average for the next three years. These guys may have been truly terrible in the past, but seem quite likely to have actually improved, rather than just found their way into fluky good seasons.
Conspiracy theorists have made the astounding claim that Putin's military forces in Syria deployed and tested advanced weapon systems developed under a secret military technology pact with extraterrestrial species.
According to Dr. Preston James in an article titled “Putin's Wild Card in Syria” published on Veterans Today, Putin's bold intervention in Syria provided the Russian military with the opportunity to test weapon systems developed under top-secret projects in partnership with alien allies.
According to Preston, the Russians now appear to have a wide variety of ultra-high-tech weaponry based on exotic extraterrestrial military science and technology. Some of the alleged advanced weaponry, according to conspiracy theorists, includes supersonic torpedoes based on advanced alien inter-dimensional UFO cloaking technology.
The Russian army also deployed missiles based on alien “inter-dimensional entangled communication to evade interceptions,” Exopolitics reported.
The missiles function as “hived” systems that are able to disperse, regroup, and re-target mid-flight. The missiles are also able to execute complex mid-flight maneuvers, such as spiral patterns.

Preston claimed that according to insider sources, the Russians also deployed stealth aircraft equipped with systems based on alien inter-dimensional UFO cloaking technology that renders aircraft invisible or undetectable during flight.
Conspiracy theorist Michael Salla pointed out on their Expoolitics blog that many aspects of Preston's analysis appeared to be corroborated by previous reports issued by the ET space program whistleblower Corey Goode.
Goode claimed in several reports published on their Sphere-Being Alliance blog that top military powers run covert space military programs under secret treaties with extraterrestrial beings.
The Russian space program, according to Goode, is called Cosmosphere.
The U.S. government, according to Goode, is part of an ET alliance called the Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate (ICC).
A sensational conspiracy theory claim emerged in the conspiracy theory blogosphere recently, claiming that documents obtained by hackers show that a sum of about $8.5 trillion that Pentagon was unable to account for was actually spent on a black project to build a Star Trek Enterprise-style star ship that has been launched into space under a top-secret government-ET space program (see video below).
Similarly, Putin's Russia has reached agreements with alien species under the space program Cosmosphere. Russia's alien partners help to develop and supply advanced weapons to the Russian military.
Putin allegedly renewed Russia's treaty with the unnamed alien species during a meeting held on the Moon in March 2015. During the meeting, the aliens promised the Russians access to advanced technology to support the country's intervention in Syria.
According to conspiracy theorists, unbridled avarice caused the global elite to conspire with alien species against the rest of humanity. The elite have suppressed information about contact with alien species and the availability of advanced science and technology that can help to solve a lot of problems and challenges facing humanity, such as in the fields of medicine and food production.
Aliens have been exploiting the avarice of the ruling elite. They have reached an advanced stage of a sinister plan to take over the world by 2030, according to conspiracy theorists. The Gray-Reptilian confederates have developed alien-human hybrids and are secretly integrating them into human society as part of a plan to take over the world by 2029-2030.
According to Preston, sources within the secret ET space programs claimed that ISIS troops are paid mercenaries of the Illuminati cabal. Many of the soldiers are genetically engineered clones and cyborg super-soldiers created using advanced Draco-Reptilian alien genetic engineering technology and deployed by the NWO-Globalists.
The Draco Reptilians, according to conspiracy theorists, are among the evilest and bloodthirstiest of known alien species fighting for control over Earth.
Alien folklore claims that they consider human flesh a culinary delicacy.
The reason why, despite their advanced technology, the evil Reptilians have not taken over Earth is that they are opposed by other powerful and benevolent alien species such as the Pleiadians and the Arcturian aliens.
It is also believed that the ET species that the Russians have signed a treaty with are old enemies of the Draco Reptilians. Russia's ET allies deliberately supplied the country's military with advanced weapon systems and ultra-high-tech electronic systems to counter the Dracos. They instigated Putin to intervene in Syria to checkmate the Draco-Reptilian-backed Illuminati cabal that controls President Barack Obama and the U.S. government, according to conspiracy theorists.
Preston narrated an incident that occurred in April 2014 when the Russians tested the superior capability of their alien technology-based jamming systems. The Russians flew Su-24 tactical bombers equipped with alien electronic systems over the U.S. Navy's USS Donald Cook. The Russians were able to shut down the ship's electrical systems and disable its radar and defense systems.
It was rumored that some senior U.S. military officers were so frustrated by the incident that they resigned their commissions, despairing of the capability of the U.S. military to match the Russians in a full-scale engagement.
It was also rumored that U.S. aircraft carriers were hurriedly withdrawn from the Persian Gulf after the incident because it was clear that they had no means of effective defense against Russian alien technology.

Beijing and Caracas have agreed to reinforce collaboration in energy, finance and infrastructure within multiple frameworks, such as a cooperation forum between China and Latin America.
In Venezuela on the second stop of their four-nation Latin America trip, Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday talked separately with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and with Wang's counterpart, Elias Jaua. After their Venezuelan visit, Wang is scheduled to head to Argentina and Brazil.
Optimistic about Venezuela's future development, Wang said China cherishes the traditional friendship with Venezuela and hopes to deepen cooperation as the two countries celebrate the 40th anniversary of diplomatic ties this year.
"China and Latin America, both in development, share common pursuits, goals and tasks. Strengthening cooperation with Latin America is an important component of China's all-around diplomacy," Wang said.
"The first China-Latin America forum will convene this year. China is willing to seek common development and prosperity with regional countries on this platform," they said.
In January, the second summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), held in Cuba, adopted a special statement on the establishment of a China-CELAC forum as a way to promote overall cooperation between the two.
Wu Changsheng, a researcher of Latin American studies at the China Foundation for International Studies, said, "The forum, considered as the new milestone of China-Latin American relations, will tap further economic and trade potentials between the two sides."
Qi Fengtian, an expert on Latin American studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the forum is a win-win cooperation, given Latin America's multilateral diplomacy and China's enthusiasm for dialogue with the region.
"The current priority lies in establishing the mechanism, followed by efforts from both sides to deepen exchanges in various areas," Qi said.
During their talk with Wang, Maduro said greatly fruitful developments have taken place since China and Venezuela established a strategic partnership in 2001 under the administration of then-Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez.
"Venezuela will carry on the bilateral friendship created by leaders of both countries and help advance cooperation between China and other Latin American countries," they said.
Maduro also said that Venezuela hopes to boost its oil exports to China by more than half to a million barrels a day. They added that the two countries are in talks on investments to achieve this goal, AFP reported.
As the world's largest supplier of proven oil reserves, Venezuela exported on average 626,000 barrels of oil to China daily last year.
In September, during Maduro's trip to China, the two sides signed 12 cooperation agreements on energy, education, agriculture and construction, including the establishment of a mixed company to develop Venezuela's Junin 1 oil field. The field is expected to produce 200,000 barrels of crude oil a day.
Wang also expressed concerns about the tensions inside Venezuela, where at least 41 people have been killed since a wave of demonstrations against Maduro's government broke out in early February, AFP said.
"As friends, we pay close attention to the situation inside Venezuela. We trust in the ability and intelligence of the Venezuelan people to settle independently and on their own, the current problems," Wang said.
Qi said China is confident that the situation in Caracas is under control, adding that stability in Venezuela is crucial to the successful implementation of the signed agreement.
"China will support and expand cooperation with the Maduro administration while maintaining cautious communication with the opposition, in an effort to steer the situation toward favorable stability," Qi said.
Wang arrived in Caracas from their first stop in the region, Cuba, where they met with Cuban leader Raul Castro and held talks with their counterpart Bruno Rodriguez.
Wang urged the two countries to translate the strength of high-level political relationship into concrete results of mutually beneficial cooperation and to further promote exchanges on their respective experience in governance.
They also called for enhanced bilateral cooperation in such key areas as trade, investment, agriculture, infrastructure, energy and mining, saying the two sides need to foster new growth points in cooperation in tourism, renewable resources and bio-technology.

“this censoring species of activism for what it is: an assault on the foundational values of the university”
Starting this month, Brown University is hosting a lecture series on the importance of freedom of expression. Anyone who has been following news out of Rhode Island's only Ivy League school for the last few years will appreciate the richness of that.
A Brown alum named Rob Montz described the situation in an op-ed at USA Today:
What happened to American universities? On October 11, Brown University is hosting the first in a new series of lectures on the proper balance between “freedom of expression, tolerance, and inclusion” on college campuses. It's an appropriate venue. Over the last couple years, Brown students have sabotaged a lecture from former NYC police chief Ray Kelly, successfully pressured the campus newspaper to pull a controversial column about European colonialism, and set up a puppy-equipped safe space to escape a debate about rape culture. While the series boasts some impressive speakers, including Yale law professor Robert Post and New Yorker staff writer Jelani Cobb, it's unlikely to accomplish much. Administrators at Brown — like so many of their ivory tower counterparts — refuse to see this censoring species of activism for what it is: an assault on the foundational values of the university. Indeed, it's not clear Brown's top brass see it as a threat at all. At its most recent commencement, one student speaker named Sabrina Imbler — handpicked by the administration — defended the activist outburst that killed the newspaper column as necessary to “defend our humanity.” And the school recently appointed to an associate deanship Professor Tricia Rose, who is known to prompt students to literally pledge allegiance to their politics…. Students are on a hair-trigger, eager to turn minor slights into examples of “structural” oppression and assume nefarious motives in critics. They regularly deploy an insidious rhetorical sleight-of-hand that equates the mental discomfort of hearing adverse opinions with real, physical violence. Those who question affirmative action, rape culture or other planks of the prevailing campus orthodoxy aren't just wrong; they're making the campus “unsafe.”
Montz produced a documentary earlier this year which we reviewed in July.
Here it is again, in case you missed it:
In terms of free expression at Brown, let's take a walk down memory lane:
Perhaps Brown should host a lecture series that focuses on not shouting down lecturers before they venture into the deep end of the free speech pool.
We don't want anyone to get triggered, do we?
Why so serious? Do you want to know how USA Today got these figures of Christian Bale's Batman and Heath Ledger's Joker in LEGO form? Plus, a LEGO version of the Batmobile, aka Tumbler, from Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight .
THE DARK KNIGHT (2008) reunites director Christopher Nolan ("The Prestige") with star Christian Bale ("Empire of the Sun"), who returns to continue Batman's war on crime. With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Batman sets out to destroy organized crime in Gotham for good. The triumvirate proves to be effective, but they soon find themselves prey to a rising criminal mastermind known as the Joker (Heath Ledger), who thrusts Gotham into anarchy and forces the Dark Knight ever closer to crossing the fine line between hero and vigilante.
THE DARK KNIGHT (2008) was directed by Christopher Nolan, from a script written by Jonathan Nolan, David S. Goyer and of course Christopher Nolan himself. The film starred: Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Heath Ledger as Joker, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, Michael Caine as Alfred, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel, Gary Oldman as Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow, and Eric Roberts as Maroni.
have offered the first look at new LEGO sets based on Christopher Nolan's masterpiece,. The LEGO Tumbler set can be constructed from 1,869 pieces and will set you back $199. It will go on sale in September at LEGO stores and shop.LEGO.com. Here's some additional information about the product: "15 inches tall and 9 inches wide, the LEGO Tumbler has an armored exterior, adjustable wings, a detailed interior (with a console screen that reads "INTIMIDATE") and oversized rubber-tread tires. It also comes with a fact sheet about the vehicle from the movies." There's also two mini-figure with the Tumbler set: Christian Bale's Batman and Heath Ledger's Joker. This is the first time Ledger's Joker has appeared in LEGO form. That performance earned Ledger an Oscar. If you'd like to get a close-up look at these items they will be on display at Comic-Con next weekend.
Countries that have banned female genital mutilation should allow less invasive practices such as small surgical nicks to girls' genitalia as a compromise, two U.S. gynecologists said on Monday.
But campaigners against mutilation strongly criticized the proposal, saying it would undermine global efforts to eradicate the internationally condemned ritual.
At least 200 million girls and women have been subjected to FGM in over 30 countries, according to UN estimates.
The ancient practice usually involves the partial or total removal of a girl's external genitalia. In some cases the vaginal opening is also sewn up.
But some communities practice less invasive rituals such as pricking or nicking the clitoris.
The U.S. gynecologists, writing in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that permitting more minimal procedures could allow families to uphold cultural and religious traditions while protecting girls from more dangerous forms of cutting.
Communities which support FGM often consider it a prerequisite for marriage. Many also see it as a religious obligation, although it is not mentioned in the Qur'an or Bible.
But female genital mutilation can cause a host of physical and psychological problems.
Gynecologists Kavita Shah Arora and Allan Jacobs said procedures that slightly changed the look of a girl's genitalia without damaging them were comparable to male circumcision or cosmetic procedures in Western countries like labiaplasty.
Laws against mild modifications were "culturally insensitive and supremacist and discriminatory towards women", they wrote in the specialist publication that is published by the British Medical Journal.
'Behind the times'
Female genital mutilation is practised in many African countries, pockets of Asia and the Middle East, as well as by diaspora communities living in the West.
The gynecologists suggested that global attempts to stamp out FGM with legislation had failed and may be driving the practice underground.
"We are not arguing that any procedure on the female genitalia is desirable," they said. "Rather, we only argue that certain procedures ought to be tolerated by liberal societies."
They said the term "female genital mutilation" should be replaced with the less emotive "female genital alteration" to avoid "demonising important cultural practices".
But experts on medical ethics, commenting on the proposal, said procedures to modify girls' genitals could not be compared to male circumcision because they are designed to control women and curb their sexual desire.
They also predicted that legalising more minimal procedures would generate a litany of legal, regulatory and medical problems.
Global campaigners against FGM said doctors should challenge harmful social norms, not condone them.
"Any form of FGM is a violation of a child's rights," said Adwoa Kwateng-Kluvitse, head of global advocacy at the charity FORWARD, which campaigns against FGM in Africa and Europe.
"Why would you put a little girl through that? There should be no medicalization of FGM. They [the gynecologists] are completely behind the times.
"This is very different to male circumcision."
In an email, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada said female genital cutting is recognized as a harmful practice and a violation of girls' and women's rights to life, physical integrity, and health.
Performing or assisting in female genital cutting is a criminal offence in Canada.
The following editorial is from Newsday.
The nation now needs an independent counsel to continue the federal investigation of Russia's involvement in the 2016 election and whether President Donald Trump, and those trying to get them elected, were connected to that effort.
The firing yesterday of FBI Director James Comey, who was personally leading the probe, is troubling. The timing is shocking. The reason the White House cited is suspect.
Comey's dismissal came a day after testimony before the Senate about the FBI's Russia investigation made front pages around the country. Yet Trump suddenly determined that Comey had to go immediately because of the controversial news conference they held about Hillary Clinton's emails – on July 5.
Trump could have done this on Day One. In fact, before and since the election, they repeatedly said they had confidence in Comey.
Certainly, the news conference at which Comey announced no charges would be brought against the former secretary of state, but at which they also severely criticized them for using a private email server, was unprecedented. Many, including Clinton herself, believe Comey's dramatic interference in the race undermined the Democratic candidate. The criticism was warranted because Comey dragged the FBI into a political place it did not need to be and because they went against long-standing Justice Department guidelines.
But why fire Comey now?
The three-page letter from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein doesn't answer that critical question. They focus solely on Comey's handling of the Clinton case. Rosenstein writes, “Almost everyone agrees that the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives.”
In a letter to Trump endorsing Rosenstein's assessment of Comey, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the FBI needed a “fresh start.” Trump, in their official statement, was defensive, making a point to say that Comey had informed them three times “that I am not under investigation.” They then went on to say that they agreed with Sessions' conclusion.
Trump couldn't have been angry that Comey misstepped last week in Senate testimony when they overstated the number of classified emails that Clinton aide Huma Abedin forwarded to their husband. That error, which revived Democrats' criticism of Comey, gave Trump the opportunity to paint the firing as coming with bipartisan support. Surely, more details will be revealed. Until then, the only conclusion to be drawn is that the White House decided that the FBI's Russia probe was getting too close for comfort.
On Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, whom Trump fired in January, delivered damning testimony that Michael Flynn, Trump's first national security adviser, was compromised because of their dealings with Russia. Several hours later, Trump blasted out four angry tweets, including, “Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?”
Trump doesn't have the power to end this story. And now it will not end until the nation is convinced that the president wasn't trying to obstruct justice by firing the FBI director.

If you are voting in Craven County, North Carolina, you might not have a choice who you will be voting for this year. Reports indicate that some machines will vote for the Democrats no matter what you do. Only after having an election official review the machine did the problem cease.
From the New Bern Sun Journal:
A Craven County voter says they had a near miss at the polls on Thursday when an electronic voting machine completed their straight-party ticket for the opposite of what they intended.
Sam Laughinghouse of New Bern said they pushed the button to vote Republican in all races, but the voting machine screen displayed a ballot with all Democrats checked. They cleared the screen and tried again with the same result, they said. Then they asked for and received help from election staff.
“They pushed it twice and the same thing happened,” Laughinghouse said. “That was four times in a row. The fifth time they pushed it and the Republicans came up and I voted.”
M. Ray Wood, Craven County Board of elections chairperson, issued a written statement saying that the elections board is aware of isolated issues and that in each case the voter was able to cast their or their ballot as desired.
Chuck Tyson, chairperson of Craven County GOP, remains skeptical. They have been communicating with Wood about the issue and was invited to a meeting Wednesday with state elections officials. There were no further details about that meeting.
“Something is not right here,” Tyson told the Sun Journal. They said they “got two or three calls” from people describing the same problem while they were voting.
“I'll be mattered of fact, I didn't find that press release satisfactory,” Tyson said, referring to Wood's written statement.
Tyson reported other problems as well, including long lines waiting for just two voting machines in Havelock, and machines reporting 250 ballots cast where 400 voters had signed in to vote.
Laughinghouse cast their ballot at the county administration building at about 2:30 p.m., they said. After voting, they located a Republican worker on site and asked to speak with them about their voting machine issue. A man interrupted, they said, directing Laughinghouse to talk with them instead. That man said the machine likely needed to be calibrated, Laughinghouse said, and set about the method to do so.
“Each morning every voting unit is calibrated as per manufacturer instructions by trained election rovers,” Wood's statement said. “These individuals are also working throughout the county each day to assist one-stop officials with any issues that arise during the course of voting.”
Laughinghouse advises voters to carefully check their ballots before confirming to ensure that the machine is logging each vote as intended.
“If you're in a hurry, you may just push the button and not notice it,” they said.
They have become suspicious of voter fraud because of news reports they have heard. They would prefer voting machines to display an error message when they need to be calibrated, as opposed to completing ballots for the opposite party, they said.
“I'm all for our country and we know there has been voter fraud before and it continues even today,” Laughinghouse said. “So you get suspicious when something like this happens.”
The elections board also encourages voters to check their ballots carefully and to report any problems to poll staff before confirming the electronic ballot.
“It is our desire to provide the citizens of Craven County with the most honest and fair election possible,” Wood's statement said. “With that in mind and because we seek to maintain the privacy of all voters whenever possible, we ask any voter, while in the act of voting, notify an election official immediately should they experience any difficulties in casting their ballot.”
Wood was unavailable to expand on their written comments on Friday afternoon, as they were in a conference, an elections office employee said. They did not return a phone message seeking additional comment as of press time.
Tyson said he'd like it if Craven County would scrap its voting machines.
“They never work, they're late reporting, they screw up, they ain't worth a damn and we ought to go back to paper ballots,” they said.
What do you get when you jam Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, The Flash, and Cyborg into a single movie in China?
The answer, sadly, is “Ant-Man.”
All of DC's top heroes combined appear to be headed toward earning about as much theatrical revenue in China, or less, as Marvel's Ant-Man did in its franchise debut in 2016.
As of late evening Beijing time on Friday, Justice League had closed in on a $16 million opening day box office total, including Thursday previews and midnight screening collections. Assuming the picture stays on its current trajectory, it will finish its debut weekend with around $50 million. If it then follows that with a 2.1x lifetime multiple on its first weekend—an optimistic projection, to be sure—it will finish with a $105 million PRC total, exactly what Ant-Man collected all by their tiny little self last year.
That's the optimistic case. A slightly more pessimistic—but equally plausible—scenario, would have Justice League earn a China lifetime multiple of 1.8 times the opening weekend figure, to take it to a $90 million total. Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, et. al. would in that case just equal the box office take that Wonder Woman earned this past summer.
In neither case would Justice League reach $1 billion in global box office receipts. It would need China to kick in at least $150 million in collections, and probably more like $200 million, to cross into ten-figure box office territory.
The billion dollar box office mark wouldn't guarantee profitability for Justice League; it cost Warner Bros. (NYSE:TWX) over $300 million to produce the film and probably $200 million to market, and with more than half the box office receipts going to theater owners, the picture will need to rely far more on home video, digital distribution and TV sales than on box office to break into the black. The billion dollar figure is important mainly because Warner Bros. needs it for company optics—to have all of its biggest superhero characters together earn less than, say, Minions or Finding Dory or Captain America did, would be a profound embarrassment for the company, not to mention a blow for Zack Snyder, Kevin Tsujihara, and for Warners' DC studio.
Until recently, before its modern day cinema boom started, China mattered little in such affairs, because it accounted for only a negligible share of global cinema revenue. But in recent years, since it emerged as Hollywood's most important overseas box office territory, China has played an increasingly essential role as kingmaker for those films aiming for the rarefied billion dollar threshold. In the case of Justice League, one billion might be out of reach anyway, but it will almost certainly be an unattainable pipe dream without a big boost from the Middle Kingdom.
Of the 13 films that have reached billionaire box office status in the past three years, seven wouldn't have gotten there without China's ticket sales contribution. Transformers: Age of Extinction, The Fate of the Furious, Despicable Me 3, Captain America: Civil War, Finding Dory, Zootopia and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story all made it over the top thanks to China's movie-going audiences.
Marvel has invested years in China, and put 17 movies into the market in order to make its movies reliable box office draws there. Warner Bros. is still far behind. It will need to do more than offer the same old if it hopes to conquer what will soon be the world's biggest box office territory.

The Gamecocks shuffled between three different QBs's last season before finally finding their guy in Jake Bentley. Bentley shined, throwing for 1,420 yards, 9 TDs and 4 INTs, while compiling a 65.8% completion percentage in just 7 games. Bentley will be a key piece to the Gamecocks season in 2017 and should lead South Carolina to their second straight bowl game.
Meet The Quarterbacks…
QB – #19 Jake Bentley, Soph / #12 Mike Scarnecchia, Jr
*Bold indicates starter
Biggest Area of Improvement…
Thankful for this season. We have learned a lot and will use these lessons to make us better. Spurs Up 🐔#NeverAgain #OurTimeIsComing pic.twitter.com/kCnXCnorHp — Jake Bentley (@JakeBentley19) December 30, 2016
On the road. Bentley showed flashes of brilliance last season, leading the Gamecocks to a 4-2 record down the stretch and a bowl appearance against USF. They shined in the bowl game, throwing for 390 yards with 3 TD's. Where Jake struggled was on the road. Their youth and inexperience showed in trips to Florida and Clemson, where they threw for a combined 367 yards and 0 TD's. While it has been a focal point all season, Bentley will need to mature and become a leader for an offense if they want to have success in the tough road environments you face week after week in the SEC.
What About The Backup?
Michael Scarnecchia. After Perry Orth's graduation and the transfer of former QB Brandon McIlwain, all eyes will turn to Scarnecchia to fill in the back-up QB role behind starter Jake Bentley. If anything, last year showed us that the next man up has to be ready at all times and could be called upon at any point. While they have had limited playing time, Scarnecchia showed their ability to make all of the throws in the spring game and is one of the older players in the program. While we all hope the only reason we see them in a game is because South Carolina is up 50, you always need a solid back-up just in case your main guy gets dinged up. Scarnecchia should be a solid option #2.
Season Will Be Successful If…
Show the ability to win on the road. I was very close to calling a successful season throwing for “X” number of yards and “X” number of touchdowns. In 2017, I think Bentley will be judged more so how they lead their football team on the road. Coming into the season, there is no doubt this is Jake's team and they will be leaned on heavily and looked at as the leader of the offense. The Gamecocks start fast out the gate, hosting NC State in a neutral site game in Charlotte, NC. They then head to the other Columbia to take on Missouri in their first SEC game of the season. Jake Bentley will have plenty of opportunities to prove themselves on the road as the Gamecocks travel to Missouri, Texas A&M, Tennessee, and Georgia. Win on the road and the numbers will take care of themselves.
Overall Grade…
QB @JakeBentley19 has been named to the watch list for the O'Brien Award, given to the nation's best quarterback #SpursUp — Armchair S. Carolina (@ArmchairSCAR) July 19, 2017
A. This is as solid as the QB position has been since Connor Shaw was taking the snaps from center. Bentley is one of the top young QB's in the SEC and should have a breakout year as 10 of 11 total starters return on offense. Michael Scarnecchia provides a solid veteran presence behind them and should be able to come in and do a solid job if any emergency situations do arise. Look for Bentley to have a banner season and lead South Carolina to their second straight bowl game.

However, the genre of social and political allegory became increasingly common. As animation developed, so did its visual style, taking inspiration from contemporary trends in the visual arts, such as cubism, surrealism and abstract expressionism. Polish animation is bold and experimental in its approach: artist duo Walerian Borowczyk and Jan Lenica won the Grand Prize at the 1958 Brussels Experimental Film Festival with their grim, non-narrative short film Home (Dom, 1958). Along with Lenica's award winning cut-out film Labyrinth (Labirynt, 1962), Home depicts people trapped in a repressed, surreal world, where omnipresent surveillance of a threatening system is in operation. The same overwhelmingly claustrophobic atmosphere appears in the Oscar-winning short film Tango (1981) by the experimental filmmaker Zbigniew Rybczynski. Based on cleverly assembled cut-out video loops shot from a static point of view, the film shows how an average living room gets occupied by 36 people over monotonous choreography of characters entering and exiting the room.
Puppet theatre is one of the most popular performing arts in Czech culture, and was even used as a way to keep the Czech language alive during the forced Germanisation of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Originally a puppeteer and illustrator, Jiri Trnka became the most influential artist among the animators in Prague after 1945. Their last short puppet film, The Hand (Ruka, 1965) features a large ,live-action hand, which invades the home of a marionette potter, demanding that the defenseless wooden puppet depict him. The film is widely read as a parable about the mechanisms of oppression, which thanks to being open to various interpretations, was read as a protest against the foreign (Nazi or Western) enemies of socialism by the Soviet censors. At international film festivals, however, it was celebrated as an allegory about the totalitarian Soviet control over the arts.
NASA and SpaceX announced today the launch of SpaceX's fifth commercial resupply services mission to the International Space Station now will occur no earlier than Tuesday, Jan. 6. This will provide SpaceX engineers time to investigate further some of the issues that arose from the static fire test of the Falcon 9 rocket on Dec. 16 and will avoid beta angle constraints for berthing the Dragon cargo ship to the station that exist through the end of the year.
Beta angles are the angles between the space station orbital plane and the sun, resulting in the station being in almost constant sunlight for a 10 day period. During this time, there are thermal and operational constraints that prohibit Dragon from berthing to the station. This high beta period runs from Dec. 28 through Jan. 7.
The new launch date also will allow the teams to enjoy the holidays.
Space station managers will meet on Monday, Jan. 5, for a thorough readiness review in advance of the Jan. 6 launch attempt. The launch postponement has no impact on the station's crew, its complement of food, fuel and supplies and will not impact the science being delivered to the crew once Dragon arrives at the station.
A launch on Tuesday, Jan. 6, is scheduled at about 6:18 a.m. EST. NASA TV coverage will begin at 5 a.m.
A backup launch attempt is available on Wednesday, Jan. 7.
A launch on Jan. 6 will result in a rendezvous and grapple of Dragon on Thursday, Jan. 8, at approximately 6 a.m. NASA TV coverage will begin at 4:30 a.m. Installation coverage will begin at 9 a.m.
Prelaunch briefings at NASA's Kennedy Space Center will be rescheduled for Monday, Jan. 5 with the times to be determined.

It has begun. Last week, the Indianapolis Museum of Art began charging for general admission to its "upper campus," which includes the museum, the surrounding gardens and Oldfields-Lilly House and Gardens. General admission runs $18 for adults and $10 for visitors ages 6 to 17. Child ages 5 and under are admitted free.
General admission was free to the museum from 1941 to 2006, when a $7 fee was instituted for non-members. But by January 2007, the museum had reverted to a free admission policy.
The museum is spinning this as a desirable switch from a la carte pricing to a single ticket that includes parking and access to special exhibitions. A press release announcing the policy claimed that "visitor research has shown that IMA guests do not like paying for parking and key programs like exhibitions separately." (But did that research indicate that they like paying for them together?)
There are plenty of exceptions: Students at four-year, public and non-profit Marion County colleges and universities are eligible for free memberships. The IMA will continue to participate in the state-wide Access Pass program, which offers $1 admission to qualifying low-income families. Admission will be free for all visitors on the first Thursday of the month from 4-9 p.m., as well as on Community Days (the next one is June 20, or the Summer Solstice) and on National Museum Day (May 19). Of course, admission is free for members. And access is free to areas that would be impossible or undesirable to police, including 100 Acres, the Sutphin Mall (home to LOVE) and the cafe and store.
Overnight, the IMA has become one of the priciest art museums in the Midwest. Only the Art Institute of Chicago is more expensive, though it offers discounts for Chicago ($18) and Illinois ($20) residents and admits visitors ages 14 and under free.
The Art Institute of Chicago holds approximately 300,000 works of art in its collection and welcomed 1,438,158 visitors in 2012, making it the 32nd most visited museum in the world. It's considered the country's second largest art museum in terms of square footage, behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art. By contrast, the IMA's collection includes over 54,000 works of art and welcomed 384,030 visitors in 2013.
Yes, all museums are delicate snowflakes with unique economic situations. But we tend not to take into account such complex political factors when vacationing on a budget. Here then is a list of adult general admission at the Midwest's biggest art museums (including Kentucky and Tennessee), including any free days and substantial discounts for locals or youth. We left off museums undergoing extensive renovation. And we added The Louvre, just for fun.
Smoky parking lots and street corners are just part of the landscape in New Mexico during the end of summer and throughout autumn. Beginning in late August, chile roasters set up shop on street corners and outside supermarkets to roast chile peppers, the state vegetable of New Mexico, until they are perfectly blackened and blistered. This char gives them a smoky flavor that makes them perfect for topping tacos, enchiladas, hamburgers, pizza — pretty much anything that could use a spicy kick.
During a recent trip to Albuquerque, I was given a small bag of a half-dozen chiles to take home with me to New York City. Now what? I thought. I would be boarding a red-eye in a few hours and I had no clue what to do with them once I got home. Thankfully, just a few days earlier, I watched Jimmy Wagner, who owns and operates Wagner Farms with their wife Roxanne, roast 40-pound bags of green chiles in an industrial-size roaster at their farm just outside of Albuquerque. Each revolution of the giant barrel rotates the chiles so that they're licked and charred by the open flame. The Wagners are fourth-generation farmers and their family has been growing chiles on their land in Corrales and Los Lunas, New Mexico, for more than 100 years. They estimate that they roast about 20,000 pounds of chiles each season, from Big Jim, a mild variety, to Lumbre, which Roxanne calls "XX hot," and they sell multiple varieties at their farmstand. Thanks to their years of expertise, they've agreed to coach me on the proper way to roast a batch of chiles at home using only a broiler or barbecue. Here are their instructions, just in time for your Labor Day party this weekend and the annual Hatch Chile Festival, which takes place August 31 through September 1 and celebrates the state's most popular condiment.
Broiler method
Rinse off chiles and pat dry. Using a fork, prick the chiles so that they can release any steam produced during roasting. Place the chiles evenly on a cookie sheet below the broiling element. Once one side of the chiles has started to blister, carefully turn them over and broil until all sides are charred. Remove the cookie sheet from broiler. If you're going to use the chiles immediately, place a damp towel over them for about 10 minutes to loosen the skin and peel it off. Slice the chiles to your desired size.
If you're not using the chiles immediately, leave the skins on to retain flavor and let cool before putting into a Ziploc bag and freezing. (Make sure to press out as much air as possible before zipping shut.) To defrost, run the chiles under slow-running room temperature water, which will help the skins peel off. Chiles can be frozen for up to a couple of years.
Grilling method
Rinse, pat dry, and prick with a fork as you would with the broiler method. Place the chiles on the grill in direct flame, flipping them over once they've started to blister. (You'll have to babysit the chiles a bit more with this method.) Once charred, follow preparation tips for the broiler method to remove skins or to freeze. (The Wagners recommend using a propane grill over a charcoal one.)

Frankfurt am Main (AFP) - Some 70,000 people in Frankfurt will have to leave their homes this weekend in one of the biggest such evacuations in post-war Germany, police said Wednesday, after an unexploded World War-II bomb nicknamed "blockbuster" was uncovered.
The operation on Sunday will allow for the safe defusal of the 1,400-tonne British bomb, which German media said was nicknamed "Wohnblockknacker" (blockbuster) during the war for its ability to wipe out whole streets or buildings.
The unexploded bomb was discovered on Tuesday during building work a stone's throw from the Westend Campus of the Goethe University Frankfurt, police said in a statement.
Officers are guarding the site and there "is currently no danger".
Police said the bomb in question was a HC 4000, a so-called high capacity bomb used in air raids by British forces.
"Due to the large size of the bomb, extensive evacuation measures must be taken," police said.
The Wismarer street where the ordnance was found is close to the city centre and just some 2.5 kilometres (1.5 miles) north of the main Zeil shopping area.
More than 70 years after the end of the war, unexploded bombs are regularly found buried on German land, legacies of the intense bombing campaigns by the Allied forces against Nazi Germany.
One of the biggest such evacuations to date took place last Christmas, when another unexploded British bomb forced 54,000 people out of their homes in the southern city of Augsburg.
Another 50,000 residents had to leave their homes in the northern city of Hanover in May for an operation to defuse several WWII-era bombs.
Citation Issued for Violating Deer Carcass Transportation Regulations
10/20/2017 2:59:59 PM
From MDWFP
DESOTO COUNTY ­– On October 17, 2017, conservation officers of the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) issued a citation to a DeSoto County man for violating 40 Miss. Admin. Code, Part 2, Rule 2.7, Prohibition on Cervid Carcass Importation.
The DeSoto County resident had recently traveled to Wyoming to hunt mule deer. After their return to Mississippi, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department contacted the hunter to inform them that the mule deer they harvested in Wyoming had tested positive for Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD). The positive result was confirmed by the Wyoming State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Laramie, Wyoming. Chronic Wasting Disease is a fatal neurological disease that affects cervids (white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, moose, caribou, red deer, sika deer, and fallow deer).
After being notified by Wyoming that their deer had tested positive for CWD, the DeSoto County resident contacted the MDWFP. Conservation officers were dispatched to collect the remains of the deer. The mule deer had not been processed as required by the regulation; therefore, the officers issued the citation.
The Commission on Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks passed the carcass importation regulation in May of 2016, in an effort to prevent the introduction of CWD into Mississippi. Similar restrictions are in place in other states.
“It is our duty to protect the state's natural resources, and the public health, safety, and welfare,” stated Colonel Steve Adcock, Chief of Law Enforcement for the MDWFP. Adcock went on to say, “this regulation will hopefully help us to prevent something catastrophic from occurring here in Mississippi.”
Hunters are encouraged to review Mississippi's rules on lawful transportation of trophies or meat from animals harvested out of state, before bringing these items into Mississippi.
To date, no cases of CWD have been confirmed in Mississippi.

'Frankly, I think we have good reason to believe that there's a bombshell in Donald Trump's taxes.'
In an interview with Fox News' Neil Cavuto, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney hinted on Wednesday there may be a “bombshell” in Donald Trump's tax information.
“Frankly, I think we have good reason to believe that there's a bombshell in Donald Trump's taxes,” they said.
Romney has stepped up their troll game by poking fun at Trump's thin-skinned reaction.
Methinks the Donald doth protest too much. Show voters your back taxes, @realDonaldTrump. #WhatIsHeHiding — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) February 25, 2016
When asked what could be hidden in Trump's finances, Romney suggested the real estate mogul may not be as rich as they claim or may not be the biggest advocate for veterans and the disabled if the information shows they don't put their money where their mouth is.
“Donald Trump has said he's the best in the country for the disabled veterans and for the disabled generally,” Romney said. “Well, if their taxes show that they haven't made any contributions to the disabled veterans, or to the disabled generally, that would be a big issue.”
Romney themselves was very publicly criticized for their finances when they ran (unsuccessfully) for president in 2012. Even after they turned over a whopping 550 pages of tax returns to the public, they were still excoriated. This time around, Romney has been advocating that their Republican colleagues undergo the same type of financial scrutiny.
Trump likes to talk about their wealth and remind voters how rich they are.  They are also reportedly very sensitive about their finances. In 2013, comedian Anthony Jeselnik told Joan Rivers that when they roasted Trump on Comedy Central, the only thing off limits were jokes suggesting Trump had less money than they claim.

It's hard to believe that small businesses get hacked when we see on the news only the information about large-scale breaches happening in big corporations. Recent events have shown us that a lot of big corporations have had immense breaches due to poor security measures.
Highlighting WannaCry outbreak and Equifax breach, we somehow think that the big corporations are more of a target than small businesses. Actually, the situation is not what it looks like, of course, the attacks targeted to small and medium-sized businesses are not on the first page of the newspapers, but in reality according to the statistics released by Symantec half of the attacks usually are against small business websites.
A really good example comes from Austria and it's about a hotel, that was hacked four times in a row. A beautiful hotel in Austria's Alps was hacked four times between December 2016 and January 2017 where hackers got access to the hotel's electronic door locks.
“We got a ransomware mail which was hidden in a bill from Telekom Austria,” says Mr. Brandstatter. – BBC News
In addition to unusable door locks, the hotel's hard drive was compromised and the hotel had to pay a ransom of two bitcoins, which at the moment is a really big amount of money.
So why small businesses get hacked?
Small businesses get hacked because they are usually the ones low in security and therefore are a primary target for hackers.
Awareness in the cyber world is still one of the biggest problems as business executives and employees are unaware of the risks that the cyber world holds.
“Actually, as a small business you do not really think that anybody's interested in you for hacking, so we had no plan what to do,” Mr. Brandstatter. via. BBC News
No organization wants its data to be compromised, as the result is not only a reputation loss but also penalties or fines. Proper security awareness and protection will reduce the risk to the organization's data and information systems.
The world is connected and it is important that everyone protects their data. To small and medium-sized enterprises wondering why would anyone hack them we have to also say that it's not them the hacker is targeting in some cases. The truth is that hackers can crawl their way into bigger companies through SME's.
How to prevent? Where to begin?
First of all are the basics – strong passwords, updates, and backups.
With strong passwords, it is one step closer to being secured from breaches or hacks. We would recommend using password management (e.g. KeePass 2).
A lot of hacks happen because the staff is not aware of the risks. We encourage SMEs to educate more in terms of cybersecurity. Not only about your website (what to do and what not do to, how to update and patch the vulnerabilities) but also everything that is happening all over the web. Hackers like everyone else innovate and sometimes it is very hard to understand what is legitimate and what not.
Cybersecurity is often misunderstood as a technical problem, almost every breach is directly or indirectly caused by a bad cyber hygiene or just the lack of security awareness. Of course, there is a happy ending to the incident mentioned above, the hotel installed firewalls and a new antivirus software trained its staff and changed the locks into manual (which isn't actually necessary if you have proper security measures in place.)
Take your first step towards protecting your company. It's an ongoing process that should always stay in the back of your mind. You can start 14-day trial here for free, by protecting and monitoring the online face of the business – your website.
Dalí was inspired by obscure scientific theories throughout their entire life and practice. In 1958, they proclaimed themselves interested in the work of physicist Dr Werner Heisenberg in a gallery catalogue. But according to Dalí, the feeling was mutual between themselves and Heisenberg, the name adopted by Breaking Bad anti-hero Walter White for their meth-cooking purposes. Dalí wrote: "I, who previously only admired Dalí, will now start to admire that Heisenberg who resembles me".
3. Dalí was expelled from art school, but only because they wanted to be
The budding artist refused to be examined for the art history final of their degree, saying “none of the professors of the school being competent to judge me, I retire”. Dalí's reason for leaving was not, however, ideological, but practical: they wanted to continue being financially supported by their father, but this would stop once they had a degree. Instead, they had reason to go and study in Paris at their expense.
REUTERS Theresa May knows all about immigration after being Home Secretary for six years
Elevated into the job in the mayhem following the resignation of David Cameron, they wholly accepted the referendum result – even though they had wanted the opposite – and committed themselves to making a success of it. Nothing has happened in the intervening two months to suggest that the Prime Minister does not intend to stick to their word, though their suggestion yesterday that they did not favour an Australian-style points-based system for controlling migration from the EU will lead many to wonder just how serious they are. But, for the moment, Mrs May should be given the benefit of any doubt. A points-based system - though repeatedly advocated by the Leave campaign - is only one way of controlling migration and not necessarily the best. Britain already has a points-based system to deal with migrants from outside the EU and it has not proved successful.
If Mrs May and their ministers have other ideas they should start floating them now Ross Clark
Giving points for annual earnings, for example, presents no problem for many migrants taking up posts in the City, even if they are exploiting loopholes to avoid paying tax in Britain. Yet last year ­Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust was refused permission to recruit 85 nurses from the Philippines because they failed to reach the required points. Australia's points-based system, too, is far from perfect. For one thing it is ageist. Applicants aged between 25 and 32 are automatically awarded 30 points – nearly half of the 65 they need. Applicants over 45, on the other hand, gain no automatic points. The Australian system awards 20 points for a PhD regardless of subject, so if you are a 25-year-old with a doctorate in media studies you can already nearly book your ticket to Australia. If you are a 45-year-old brain surgeon, you still have a lot of hoops to jump through.
PA 'For one thing, Australia's points-based system is ageist,' says Ross Clark
As Home Secretary, Mrs May will have seen the inadequacies of a points-based system at close quarters. A scoring system that sounds sensible to an official drawing it up in Whitehall is not necessarily going to look so good when it is applied to the real world. What the May Government does need to spell out, however, is how it is otherwise going to control migration. One thing is for sure: for those who voted to leave the EU, migration was an important issue. It was far from the only thing that mattered – after all, migration from the EU only became a significant issue when the former Soviet Bloc countries joined in 2004, yet Euro-scepticism in Britain began well before then. But migration was an issue nonetheless and it is one which the Government must make a priority in negotiations to leave the EU. Controlling migration does not mean stopping migration. Much as frustrated Remain campaigners like to try to make out that the 52 per cent of Britons who voted out are racists, there are very few people who would not want Britain to continue being the welcoming country it has long been. Open labour markets are generally a good thing for the economy if it means employers being able to recruit staff they would otherwise struggle to find.
Yet it is quite clear to a majority of Britons that completely uncontrolled migration brings with its problems. Mass migration was forced upon Britain without any debate. The result is a surge in population that was never planned for, with an inevitable knock-on effect for public services, with schools and hospitals in some areas struggling to cope. Our housing stock is inadequate with the inevitable result that low-paid migrants have been found living in insanitary conditions in garden sheds. EU leaders could have avoided all these problems had they been less obsessive about promoting free movement. What they should have done is to say that borders would be open when a country's GDP per head reached a certain percentage of the EU average. Had, for instance, Romanian migration been restricted until Romanians earned, say, 75 per cent of what Western Europeans earn we would not have these huge cross-border movements of people searching – often in vain – for what they see as streets paved with gold. This leads to one possible model for a post-EU British migration policy: completely free movement between Britain and countries which have similar levels of wealth, and the reintroduction of work permits for migrants from elsewhere.

WITH THE FRIZZ??? NO WAYYY!!!!Oh, the 90s. Every cartoon toted educational messages, often preachy and heavy-handed and sometimes awkward. With all of this wonderful ridiculousness, a show like The Magic School Bus was really welcome. It actually taught you something useful AND was fun. You never felt like someone was speaking down to you, and you just envied the small class size and the budget-bursting field trip take on 'different ways of learning.' Shit, all we got to do was make the occasional collage.Seriously though, it was a damn cool show. Anything that involves a sentient magical bus driven by a crazy witch lady and their biologically engineered super-lizard flying children around space and lower intestines is kind of worth watching. I also always loved the bit at the end, where 'real kids' asked questions about the episode, and pointed out things that couldn't have actually happened. It was a great way of covering their ass, and making us feel smart.Poor, poor Arnold though. They aren't psychologically able to cope with the mad shit storm of hands-on learning. You'd think that kid would have transferred to another class or something. You know, give some other kid the chance to RIDE AROUND ON A MAGIC SUPER BUS INSTEAD OF SITTING IN A CLASSROOM. What a douche.texture (c) ~ su-Y
Mahmoud Zayat / AFP / Getty Lebanese supporters of the government loyalist Future Movement set up a roadblock of burning tires on the road from Beirut to Saida.
The rattle of gunfire and crump of exploding rockets that shook the near-deserted streets of Beirut Wednesday seemed to signal the arrival of the long-feared showdown between the Western-backed government and its opponents led by Hizballah. Thick plumes of black smoke from barricades of burning tires cast a deep pall over the capital, as many Lebanese gloomily pondered whether the country's feuding leaders can pull back from the brink. "Both sides have dug in their heels," said Amal Saad-Ghorayeb, a political analyst and expert on Hizballah. "I think there's going to be a battle for the state now." Perhaps, but the unlikely catalyst behind the latest flare-up was a government attempt to regulate Lebanon's telephone system.
The country has been politically paralyzed for 16 months, unable to elect a new President because of a deadlock between government and opposition forces in which neither side has the strength to prevail over the other. Then came the telephone crisis: Last weekend, Walid Jumblatt, leader of Lebanon's Druze minority and an archenemy of Hizballah, accused the militant Shi'ite party of maintaining its own private telephone network, and of using security cameras to monitor Beirut airport with the possible aim of staging attacks or kidnappings. On Tuesday, the government followed up with an edict declaring Hizballah's telephone network "illegal and unconstitutional." It also launched an investigation into the alleged monitoring of the airport, and dismissed airport security chief General Wafiq Shuqeir, on suspicion of opposition sympathies.
Hizballah was having none of it, angrily declaring that the telephone network is part of its military wing  which it justifies as necessary to defend Lebanon against Israel  and warning anyone seeking to dismantle it would be treated as an "Israeli spy." Within days, the two sides were shooting at one another.
Although Hizballah is known for its massive Iran-funded social welfare system that provides everything from soup to education, construction materials and matchmaking services for Lebanon's Shi'ite underclass, cell-phone service is not part of the package  except for those who join its guerrilla army. One of the world's most technically advanced and resourceful guerrilla organizations, Hizballah had some time ago installed its own, in-house dedicated fiber-optic telephone network, connecting its headquarters in the southern suburbs of Beirut to its offices, military posts and cadres as far south as the Israeli border. During the summer 2006 war, Israel had jammed cellphone signals throughout south Lebanon and monitored the Lebanese telephone system, but Hizballah's internal communications channels had survived thanks to its private fiber-optic system. Since the war, however, Hizballah has expanded the network to cover its new military frontline north of the United Nationspatrolled southern border district, and into the Bekaa Valley to the east. Part of the system incorporates a WiMAX network allowing long-distance wireless access for the Internet and cell phones.
More recently, Hizballah has dug trenches for fiber-optic cables in the mainly Christian and Druze Mount Lebanon district and in north Lebanon, according to Marwan Hamade, the Lebanese minister of telecommunications. "It was confined to one or two small areas before and we overlooked it as part of their internal communications. But now it's spread all over Lebanon," Hamade told TIME.
Wednesday's violence overshadowed what was originally supposed to be a general strike called by Lebanon's leading trade union to demand wage increases and to protest rising prices. But it quickly developed into a confrontation between supporters of the government and of the opposition. Hundreds of green-bereted Lebanese troops fanned out in Beirut as demonstrators blocked main roads with burning tires and earth dumped by trucks. The airport road was severed and the airport was closed most of the day.
Soldiers dressed in riot gear struggled to separate rival groups of stone-throwing youths. In the afternoon, gunshots and explosions echoed over the capital. Pro-government Sunni gunmen wearing ski masks set up checkpoints in their neighborhoods, demanding to see identity cards from passers-by. An office belonging to the pro-government Future Movement was destroyed by opposition gunmen firing rocket-propelled grenades. The occupants escaped as the gunmen looted weapons and ammunition from inside the office.
By evening, the fighting had died down, but both sides have vowed not to yield. Hizballah supporters were seen carrying tents to the airport road to continue the blockade of the airport until the government rescinds its moves against the telephone network and reinstates General Shuqeir.
A Shi'ite source close to Hizballah said that armed fighters had deployed to the city center where opposition supporters have been encamped for 18 months in an anti-government sit-in. The fighters are on standby in case the camp comes under attack, the source said.
Although neither side seeks a civil war, their game of brinkmanship is growing increasingly dangerous. "The problem is that things might get out of hand," says Paul Salem, director of the Carnegie Endowment's Middle East Center in Beirut. "If it gets much worse then the whole truce situation which has kept the peace these last few months might end."
Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, Hizballah's leader, is scheduled to give a rare press conference Thursday at which they are expected to outline their party's future course of action. But the fact that the reclusive Hizballah leader is speaking to the press at all underlines the seriousness of the situation: The last time they appeared before the media was on July 12, 2006  the day war broke out with Israel.
Undrafted free agent Kyle Padron announced via their Twitter page today that they will be waived by the Raiders.
I was just informed that I will be put on waivers+released from the Raider Nation today. Grateful for the opportunity, excited about the next! — Kyle Padron (@KPadron2) May 22, 2013
While Padron was unable to attend Raiders OTA's due to their college classes not being complete yet, the Raiders added a fifth quarterback to the roster - Matt McGloin.
Padron did attend Raiders three-day rookie minicamp where they failed to impress coaches and at times looked downright awful.
Unlike Padron, who had been a priority free agent signing, Matt McGloin had been invited for tryouts with the Carolina Panthers and left without a contract. With Padron unable to attend OTA's, the Raiders needed to add a fourth quarterback so they signed McGloin and brought them in.
The first OTA practices were a tryout of sorts for McGloin. The team was not going to hang onto five quarterbacks one Padron was eligible to return to the team. And McGloin walked in and simply took the job.
The record-setting Nittany Lion came in a looked like they belonged in a camp QB rotation. Good enough, in fact, it makes one wonder how they went unsigned initially, let alone as a tryout player.
This gives the Raiders four very nice options competing for the three season roster spots. Matt Flynn is pegged as the starter at current with holdover Terrelle Pryor, rookie round 4 pick Tyler Wilson, and McGloin competing to not be the odd man out come September.

The active ingredient in Roundup, one of the world's most popular weed killers -- and the most commonly used one in the United States -- has been declared a "probable carcinogen" by the World Health Organization. The International Agency for Research on Cancer, an arm of the WHO, released the results of its review of five herbicides and pesticides on Friday.
The French-based agency ranks cancer-causing agents on four levels: known carcinogens, probably or possible carcinogens, not classifiable and probably not carcinogenic. The herbicide glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, was classified by IARC as "probably carcinogenic to humans."
But the classification is not binding, said the IARC. "It remains the responsibility of individual governments and other international organizations to recommend regulations, legislation or public health intervention," the agency said in a statement. According to the Associated Press, the United States Environmental Protection Agency said it would consider the IARC's evaluation.
The IARC did clarify that the new ruling is mostly directed at the industrial use of the herbicide, and that use by home gardeners does not fall under the same classification. Glyphosate is employed in more than 750 herbicide products and has been detected in the air, during spraying and in foods, reports the IARC.
The determination is sure to alarm the agro-chemical industry and particularly Monsanto, the agribusiness giant that is the leading producer of glyphosate. Worldwide annual sales of the chemical are estimated at $6 billion. The company put out its own statement Friday: "All labeled uses of glyphosate are safe for human health," said Monsanto's Phil Miller, global head of regulatory and government affairs.
“We don't know how IARC could reach a conclusion that is such a dramatic departure from the conclusion reached by all regulatory agencies around the globe,” said Miller. Monsanto requested an urgent meeting with the World Health Organization to clarify the scientific basis of the ruling.
If ever there was any doubt Dave McKay has a tough act to follow as chief executive of Royal Bank of Canada, a record set of results on Friday was a reminder of the legacy left by their predecessor, Gord Nixon. RBC, the country's largest bank by market capitalization, posted record third-quarter profit that easily beat analyst estimates and raised its dividend, but that wasn't enough to push its stock to a new all-time high.
“I'm very pleased with the quarter,” said Mr. McKay on a conference call.
“Our record results reflect the strength of our diversified business model and leading market position.”
Royal Bank said it earned record net income of $2.378-billion in the three-month period ending July 31, representing an increase to its bottom line of $93-million, or 4%, from the same period last year and a jump of $177-million, or 8%, from the previous quarter.
On an adjusted basis, earnings were $1.64 per share, which is 8¢ higher than the average analyst estimate of $1.56.
The results were fuelled mainly by a strong performance from its capital markets segment, where profit surged 66% to $641-million due mainly to higher advisory fees in the quarter.
The bank's wealth management and insurance operations also booked record net income in the quarter, climbing 22% and 34% respectively from a year ago.
Earnings from RBC's core Canadian banking unit also hit a new high, but the pace of growth was more subdued at just 3% year-over-year.
“Overall, it was an outstanding quarter for capital markets,” Mr. McKay said. “Clearly, the segment benefited from a number of factors which aren't likely to be repeated to the same degree, but the success of the repositioning of the business is undeniable and I remain confident in their strategy.”
Barclays Capital analyst John Aiken said it was an exceptionally strong quarter for RBC, saying the bank's strong capital market performance “will likely be difficult for its peers to emulate.”
They also highlighted the 6% increase in the bank's quarterly dividend to 75¢ as a positive surprise for shareholders.
Even so, shares in RBC, which are up 13% this year, fell from their all-time closing high of 82.30% set Thursday, ending Friday's session 1% lower at $80.80.
Mr. Aiken said the market appeared focused on the few negatives in the results, notably the slowing performance of domestic retail revenue and earnings.
In addition, some investors may also be worried about the sustainability of the bank's trading revenue and insurance earnings, but they believe capital markets and wealth management earnings should be able to offset most, if not all, of the slowing retail bank earnings growth, and expects the stock to recover all of its lost ground over the next week.
“This belief is underscored not just by an expected lift in consensus estimates for 2015 as the third quarter earnings are digested, but by the impact of the 20 basis point lift in its dividend yield on its relative valuation.”
Craig Ellis, a portfolio manager at Oakville, Ont-based Bellwether Investment Management Inc. said they are not concerned by the market's reaction to RBC's earnings.
“Shares initially traded higher in reaction to the beat, but clearly some shorter-term investors have now come in to take profits, they said. “It's nothing more than the old adage: ‘buy on rumour, sell on news.'”
Ultimately, Mr. Ellis was impressed with the results and thinks Royal Bank will deliver high single-digit earnings growth over the next year.
They said loan growth continues to be quite sluggish, while competition and low interest rates have kept downward pressure on net interest margins, a key metric of bank profitability, which declined 4 basis points to 2.73% in the past year — but offsetting these challenges were the record results in capital markets, wealth management, and insurance.
“Royal Bank is widely-recognized as the Canadian bank with the most leverage to investment banking fees and trading revenues, but the Street is often reluctant to give full credit to this stream of earnings which is perceived to be more volatile,” they said.
“However, a 66% increase in net income from capital markets should ultimately be well received by the market today – profits were earned globally from a surge in equity/fixed income origination, lending, and trading activity in various securities.”
NHL referee Paul Devorski's retirement tour was supposed to end Jan. 10.
That was the Harrisburg resident's original deal with Stephen Walkom, vice president and director of officiating for the NHL. Work half of the 2014-15 season and head into the striped sunset.
Then injuries hit the orange arm band brigade.
"He says, 'Hey, you want to stay on for the other half to make another whatever?'" Devorski said. "I said, 'Sure.' Now I get paid until the end of August instead of the end of February."
Now the 56-year-old's finale will be April 5 when the Pittsburgh Penguins visit the Philadelphia Flyers in a game that is scheduled to be nationally televised.
"It will be fun," Devorski said. "Hopefully, it doesn't mean anything. But if it does ..."
Devorski, whose first NHL season was 1989-90, has worked the World Cup of Hockey, the Winter Olympics in 2006 and 2010 and the Stanley Cup Final on multiple occasions.
They said they made the decision to retire following the 2013-14 season.
"I'm ready to go," Devorski said. "It's so fast out there now. Once I said I'm done, I realize that I am done. And I see the guys that are coming up and how fast and strong they are."
The final tour has been nostalgic and sentimental, filled with farewells to buildings and members of the NHL community.
"Going up to guys and coaches," Devorski said, "saying, 'Hey, I'm not going to see you again.'"
They said they had to stop Chicago Blackhawks head coach Joel Quenneville two weeks ago.
"He said, 'Hey, you know ...,'" Devorski said. "I said, 'Hey, I've still got you two more games. I'm not saying my good-byes yet.'"
Monday night's Edmonton at Detroit game marked their final contest involving Red Wings head coach Mike Babcock.
"There are a lot of good guys out there you want to say good-bye to," Devorski said. "There are a lot of good players. That part of it, yeah, it's kind of tough. But I'm kind of looking forward to the end."
Devorski said their biggest career highlight was working Game 7 of the 2008-09 Stanley Cup Final between Detroit and the Pittsburgh Penguins at Joe Louis Arena with fellow ref Bill McCreary.
The Penguins won 2-1 after goalie Marc-Andre Fleury stopped Nicklas Lidstrom's tying bid with two seconds left.
"I was ready to point goal and the goalie saved it," Devorski said. "Two seconds later the game was over. That was probably the best thrill I had.
"My son, Luk, came to the game. I brought them on the ice afterwards. Mario Lemieux hugged them and Billy Guerin hugged him. That was good."
While Devorski's on-ice career is winding down, they still hope to work in an officiating consulting role.
"I haven't been approached, but I would like to," Devorski said. "I haven't been asked to do anything yet.
"Maybe I'll supervise in the playoff series in the American League. If they need somebody, I'm sitting right here in Hershey. I can go to Hershey, Wilkes-Barre, Binghamton, wherever you want me to go. Get me out of the house."
One in-game farewell remains on the list: Anaheim Ducks head coach Bruce Boudreau. Boudreau and Devorski own homes in the same subdivision.
With Boudreau currently an absentee owner, Devorski found themselves working as Boudreau's unofficial groundskeeper last summer.
"He has me looking after their house while he's in California," Devorski said. "I've been cutting their grass."

Purdue University students who petitioned against the College of Technology's name change can weigh in this semester on its recent transformation.
Gary Bertoline, dean of the new Purdue Polytechnic Institute, will host discussions this week on the rebranding after more than 200 students and alumni signed a petition over the summer to change the name back.
Senior Austin Haberly, who started the petition on change.org, proposed in June what they said was a fair compromise: allowing students enrolled at the time of the rebranding to graduate with College of Technology degrees.
“I do believe that's important, based on the feedback of my peers,” Haberly said in a phone interview. “Everybody is desiring that title that we've been expecting for the last three years. This was really just dropped in our laps, and we didn't really have a choice in the matter.”
The transformation has been in the works for the past two years through the Purdue Moves initiative, Bertoline said. Focus groups consisting of students, faculty and industry were interviewed before the name change was proposed. Reaction from focus groups and alumni events in several cities has been positive, they said.
“I'm pretty confident that when I get in front of the students that they will understand what it is we're doing and that they actually will want to be affiliated with this name,” they said.
The Board of Trustees approved the rebranding in May to reflect a changing mission: serving the 21st century workforce. Several new majors, a competency-based degree and an emphasis on liberal arts integration and project-based learning are all part of the rebranding, Bertoline said.
“One of the motives behind the change of the name is we want to express to people how transformational this effort is,” they said, “and to stay with same name I think would not do justice.”
Feedback on the petition and from several interviews, however, suggests students and alumni are concerned the name change could be confusing, implying they graduated from a regional campus or trade school connected to Purdue.
“As an employer, if I were to see Purdue Polytechnic Institute on a resume, I would assume it was a satellite school or something with a completely different applications process than the main university,” said Will Nash, a senior studying electrical and computer engineering technology.
The word “polytech” was also a major point of contention among students.
“The word 'polytech' has a negative connotation that people associate with a lower quality performance and output compared to a university,” said Ryan Rumble, a senior studying computer information technology.
But Bertoline noted Virginia Tech — which is actually called Virginia Polytechnic and State University — and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute — the nation's first engineering school — are well-known as prestigious institutions.
“If you look more deep into this, I think that you'll find that the word ‘polytechnic' actually has pretty high regard,” they said.
Still, Haberly said it will take time for employers and industry leaders to catch on to the change.
“During that transition, it's going to be harder for students to get recognized from companies because the companies aren't going to be familiar with the new school,” they said. “Companies already have a great idea of what the College of Technology is and they have for years.”
Bertoline noted, however, that the college's enrollment has declined in the past decade. With the transformation's focus on innovative education, they said the institute's graduates will be sought after more than ever.
“When our graduates go out and they become highly successful and recognized because they have this different kind of skill set, people will look at the ‘polytechnic' in a light that is going to be much greater than I think anyone can even imagine,” they said. “So the product is actually what's going to define the name.”

Before "Seinfeld" super-fan Jim Calder passed away Nov. 7, many of the sitcom's stars brightened their final days with personalized videos and phone calls.
In an article published Tuesday on The Huffington Post, Calder's son, James, chronicled the "amazing story about human kindness," documenting the sweet, funny and moving gestures cast members made on behalf of their father, who died just three days before their 67th birthday after a two-year battle with a rare form of lung cancer.
After James and their wife came up with the idea a few weeks ago to have friends and family wish the increasingly ill Brooklyn native a happy birthday, the couple decided to get more ambitious with their goal.
"We immediately thought of their favorite TV show, 'Seinfeld,'" James wrote. "We started planning how to pitch this to the 'Seinfeld' characters and started to reach out through published articles about the project, social media outreach and word of mouth. The 'Seinfeld' birthday project was born, but we really weren't sure how and if it would flourish."
But flourish it did, and many participating stars delivered their messages to Jim in character. The first to do so was John O'Hurley, who played J. Peterman on the series.
Patrick Warburton, aka Puddy, followed suit.
Wayne Knight (Newman) also said hello.
The spirited videos just kept on coming, including good tidings from Larry Thomas (Soup Nazi), Danny Woodburn (Mickey Abbott), Wayne Wilderson (Walter), Ping Wu (Ping), Richard Fancy (Lippman), Lisa Mende (Carol), and many more.
Even TODAY's own Al Roker, who played themselves on the sitcom, sent the super-fan their own show of support.
Other stars opted to check in with Jim in different ways.
Michael Richards, who played Kramer, "wanted to actually call my dad on the day of their birthday to wish them the best and have a chat," James wrote. "I was blown away by their kindness and generosity. I did try to coax them to create a video message as well but they shared that they aren't interested in the publicity and just wanted to help me wish my dad a happy birthday."
Jerry Stiller, who played George Costanza's father Frank, and Lawrence Mandley, who played Larry the cook, both sent videos in character, but asked that they "remain private for only my dad and our family."
Julia Louis-Dreyfus' video message arrived just hours before Jim passed away.
"I'm so thrilled and happy to hear how much you've enjoyed 'Seinfeld' along with your family; that's a great joy, so thank you for that," the Emmy-winning star told Jim in their video. "You have a wonderful son who clearly adores you, so, congratulations on that; you did that very well. And, third, I just wanted to say happy birthday. I hope it's a great one, and I'm wishing you the very best. Have fun."
Correctly predicting Jim wouldn't live to see their birthday, their son and Jim's wife, Gayle, decided to show them the videos to lift their spirits. "He was shocked and mystified about how we were able to reach the 'Seinfeld' cast members," James wrote. "He really felt the love and support."
Surrounded by family members, Jim died Nov. 7. Their obituary in the Bucks County Courier Times describes them as someone who "had razor sharp wit and loved parties, holidays and sharing laughs," adding, "He had kind eyes but a kinder soul and a brilliant mind."
It's been a few weeks since since Jim's passing, but James continues to marvel at the show of support from everyone who helped make the birthday wish possible.
"The amount of kindness shown to my family not just by the actors and actores but by all the people who read the story was overwhelming," they wrote. "People wrote to me with leads about who they knew and how they knew some of the 'Seinfeld' actors and how the wanted help my family and I reach out to them. Others just sent us beautiful emails about their own families and experiences with cancer."
Brainstorming new ways to raise money and awareness for cancer patients and their families, James asked supporters to make donations in their father's name to the American Cancer Society. In the meantime, they wrote that he's convinced that something that happened the night of their father's death is more than a coincidence.
"My wife and daughter went back to my [parents'] house for the night and my wife just turned on the TV and one of my dad's favorite episodes of 'Seinfeld' was playing," James wrote. "The Merv Griffin Show (season 9, episode 6). We all believe it was a sign from dad as they left this world for a better place."

GLENDALE, Ariz. — Carson Fulmer's jitters haven't gone away, but the White Sox 2015 first round pick is starting to feel more comfortable as they work through major league lineups during spring training.
Well, through one major league lineup — both of Fulmer's Cactus League starts have come against the defending World Series champion Kansas City Royals. They allowed one run on two hits with a walk and two strikeouts Thursday at Camelback Ranch, facing a lineup headlined by Alex Gordon, Eric Hosmer and Salvador Perez.
“The butterflies are still there from getting amped up for a start,” Fulmer said. “I felt more comfortable with it. It was my second time facing them and I'm getting a good feel of how the pace of a game goes."
The White Sox, right now, don't see Fulmer in their 2016 plans, though they certainly aren't ruling out the Vanderbilt product forcing the issue this summer. They excelled in 23 innings — a small sample size, of course — last year, posting a 1.96 ERA with 26 strikeouts, nine walks and two home runs allowed.
If and when Fulmer does reach the major leagues, their experience in these spring training games could come in handy. Specifically on Thursday, they fell behind Hosmer to lead off the second inning, worked back to a 3-2 count and then walked the Royals first baseman on a fastball in off the plate that they called a “great miss.”
“He has a good eye for pitches like that and let it go,” Fulmer said. “He's a disciplined hitter and one of the best in the game. “For me, I can build off of that so next time I face him, hopefully I have a different mindset going into it. I took a lot from that at-bat.”
[MORE: Tim Anderson returns to White Sox camp a new father]
The walk wasn't ideal, of course, but that fastball was a more aggressive miss in the spot they wanted to throw it. Fulmer said he's growing to understand that having a top-quality arsenal of pitches — as they do — isn't enough to make it at the major league level.
“If you don't have an approach and don't place it in the right spot, you're going to get hit,” Fulmer said. “Attacking early, getting ahead obviously is the job of a pitcher, but quality pitches in the zone and putting it in the zone where they're going to take swings at it.”
The Royals roughed up Fulmer for three runs on five hits in two innings on Saturday, so their start Thursday can be considered an improvement results-wise. There were a couple of hard-hit outs in there, though the run they gave up came on a bloop double, wild pitch and errant throw to third base.
While manager Robin Ventura traveled to Surprise for the other half of the White Sox split squad action Thursday, they said before leaving Camelback Ranch that they hoped Fulmer would be a little calmer their second time out.
“Hopefully it can just be a little easier,” Ventura said. “Last time they were out there they were amped up. Even for our guys, Carlos (Rodon) last year, it gets a little easier as they go out more times and have the opportunity to go out there and relax a little bit."
[SHOP: Gear up for the season ahead, White Sox fans!]
At this nascent juncture in their career, every start will bring something new for Fulmer. But they already felt more settled in spring training start No. 2, which comes across as a small-yet-positive step in their overall development.
“I feel like I'm getting really comfortable with it each time I go out there,” Fulmer said. “I'll just take the positives from this outing and move forward on to the next.”
Thousands still without power, storm clean-up continues
Updated
Energex says about 3,500 customers in south-east Queensland are still without power after Sunday's destructive storm.
Most of the affected properties are on the north side of Brisbane but about 200 homes are still without electricity at Ipswich, the Gold Coast, Redcliffe and Caboolture.
Energex says more than 500 staff worked in heavy rain last night to restore power to as many homes as possible.
The electricity provider says there are about 1,000 homes and businesses either no longer exist or are too badly damaged to be safely reconnected.
Energex is urging people in storm-affected suburbs to turn off their appliances even if they do not have power.
The warning came after a house caught fire after power was restored to streets in the worst-hit suburb of The Gap last night.
It is believed the fire was started by a stove that turned on when the electricity was re-connected. The house received only minor fire damage.
Police are closing the main road between The Gap and neighbouring Keperra this morning to clear storm debris.
Acting Superintendent Joe Joyce says Settlement Road will be closed between 9:00am and 3:00pm
They say general traffic and sightseers are hampering relief efforts.
"It will allow us to clear the debris a lot quicker than we otherwise would have," they said.
Meanwhile, Premier Anna Bligh is urging Queenslanders to dig deep and support their disaster relief appeal for victims of the storms.
The State Government is donating $500,000 to start the appeal, and Ms Bligh says the public can make donations at any Commonwealth Bank.
"We have got thousands of homes affected, more than 4,000 homes needing repair people out of their homes people in very difficult circumstances, so I just say 'Queenslanders come let's just get behind them'," they said.
"It could be any one of us over a summer season."
Public Works Minister Robert Schwarten says they and the Premier will discuss a re-building strategy this morning with insurance experts and the Building Services Authority.
"I've been in 10 years as a minister through a lot of disaster areas and it's equal to any of those," they said.
"It might be a small sample of Brisbane, but it's a very important one. There's a lot of damage and the damage rivals that of any other disaster Qld has seen."

Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore is a marketing book that espouses the need for a product or company to first find traction with early adopters before attempting to sell their services to the mainstream market a.k.a cross the chasm. Failure to do so will inevitably result in disastrous consequences. For many entrepreneurs and marketing people, this book is a bible.
Now what does Tan Kin Lian's poor showing at the PE2011 have to do with this tech-oriented marketing book? Very simple: they failed to find a core base of users on which to launch their campaign on. These core base of users would be analogous to the early adopters that a company must first seek to convince before they attempt to cross the chasm and enter the mainstream audience.
Which was why they mentioned their two lowest points were when Tan Jee Say announced their candidacy and was later granted the Certificate of Eligibility to contest. With Tan Jee Say in the running, they grabbed what would be Tan Kin Lian's core base of opposition supporters in one fell swoop. While on the other side, Tan Cheng Bock and Tony Tan were craving up the pro-PAP supporters into the so-called PAP Grassroots a.k.a heartlanders and PAP Elites a.k.a erm… Elites. That left Tan Kin Lian with scraps.
So when Tan Kin Lian did their After Action Review and found that among other things, their inappropriate campaign logo of ‘Hi-5' or mis-reporting in the mainstream media which were the chief culprits to blame for their downfall, I'm sitting behind my desk thinking: this guy still doesn't get it. So here's my personal message to Mr Tan Kin Lian:
Dear Sir,
Firstly, I applaud you for persisting with your beliefs and not pulling out due to populist pressure. It takes a man of courage to have done what you did. As a wannabe entrepreneur, I respect your rags-to-riches journey in being a self taught programmer and eventually succeeding in the corporate world.
But I shall not sugar coat my words any longer. The reason why you lost so badly was very simple: you did not communicate a clear set of ideals and vision to a clearly defined group of people or in business speak, target audience. To put it very bluntly, you stood for nothing for no one.
As someone who has risen to the very top of the corporate world, I would have thought this to be plainly evident.
If you had gathered more support during your involvement of the Lehman Brother's Minibonds saga, that could have been a possible launch pad. But even then, you failed to gather enough rapport from the people.
The reasons you cite as contributing factors to your poor showing were merely poorly implemented tactics which by itself should not drown a candidate. The overall strategy was flawed. Even the most brilliantly executed campaign would not have saved you from a flawed campaign strategy.
So Mr Tan Kin Lian, as you are eating your mooncakes and sipping tea under the moonlight, do you still think mis-reporting was the main cause of your downfall?
Yours Sincerely,
A Wannabe Hacker.

The inaugural Raptors 905 season was a tale of two halves.
Through the first 23 games of the franchise's first year in the NBA's D-League, 905 was like any other expansion team, going 5-18 and scraping the bottom of the standings.
Then, as if by magic, they suddenly turned it around, winning six straight, jumpstarting what would end up becoming an 18-9 stretch through their last 27 games for a total record of 23-27 and a sixth-place finish in the Eastern Conference.
Except, it wasn't some magic trick. It was the result of having clear goals and a strong group—from upper management to the last player on the bench—operating on the same page. Here are some final thoughts on the 905's first-ever season.
How they turned their season around
(Frank Gunn/CP)
Despite how bad the first stretch of their season went, the 905 actually weren't that bad from the onset. Of those first 18 losses, six of them came by four points or fewer. So they were competitive, but just didn't know how to close.
“Even in training camp I felt like we had a good team,” 905 second-leading scorer Scott Suggs said at locker clear out day last week. “We were just so young and kind of inexperienced playing together. So I think we all felt like we were able to get it done because we were in a lot of games at the beginning of the year that we just lost by one, two, three points. We just needed to get over that hump and we eventually did.”
That vibe Suggs talked about from training camp is likely a result of an expansion franchise that, thanks to the heavy influence from the team's parent club Toronto Raptors, from the very outset had a lot of unity and stability that most new teams don't have the luxury of.
“In the beginning I wasn't sure what to expect,” Suggs said, “but they work really closely with the Raptors and work really well with them.”
This strong organizational steadiness also probably helped smooth out the feeling-out process at the beginning and willingness from all parties involved to adapt on the fly as the season was going along.
“There's just a huge learning curve, and a huge growth process,” head coach Jesse Mermuys said, “In the beginning of the season I was trying to coach it like it was the NBA, and that didn't work. These guys needed more help and I probably, to adjust to that, went overboard and maybe gave too much help. But as the season went along and we all got comfortable and I kind of found a sweet spot.”
All this building eventually culminated into a team that finished five games out of a playoff spot, and an 8-2 record in their last 10 games. It's fair to say that had the regular season kept going there's a good chance the 905 could've seen some post-season play.
Not bad at all for a franchise that wasn't supposed to do anything in its first year.
Bruno's late-season surge
(Frank Gunn/CP)
As the 905 ascended this season, so did Raptors 2014 first-rounder Bruno Caboclo.
For the season, the 6-foot-9 Brazilian averaged 14.7 points per game on 40.3 per cent shooting, but from the beginning of that 18-9 stretch they put up 15.7 points per on an improved 43.9 per cent from the field, that included a fabulous final month of March where they averaged 18.4 points on 44.7 per cent, and saw them come up with 27-, 29- and 31-point performances.
Coming into the season, the 905 was mostly viewed as a Caboclo development house, and if you still adhere to that train of thought, those stats are definite proof that some improvement has been made.
Looking deeper, Caboclo's shot selection also vastly improved from the beginning of the season to the end, something that's been chalked up to the 20-year-old maturing over the course of the year.
“I remember at the beginning of the season their frustration and you could tell they were visibly upset during the game,” Mermuys said. “And then I remember— it was definitely in the second half of the season— I got upset after they took two bad shots in a row, we sat them down and I looked over and they were sitting there like a pro. There was no emotion, there was no frustration. They looked like a guy who was just engaged in the game, waiting for their turn to go back in. And that was a huge moment for us to see that growth, that maturity to see that they were able to take that criticism. …
“That mental part of the game is extremely important in the NBA because this is a hard, hard league and there's going to be tons of ups and downs. And if you have the fortitude to handle it, it's really important. And that maturity off the court was almost as important as on the court.”
So while Caboclo is certainly still very raw, this season was a step in the right direction for him. Whether or not that translates into them turning into a real, polished NBA product in the near future, however, is still very difficult to say.
How the D-League helped Powell figure things out
(Chris Young/CP)
Norman Powell's stepped in as a key contributor in DeMarre Carroll's absence for the Raptors in their rookie season despite being a second-round pick and they owe a lot of the success he's had to their time down in the D-League.
Powell averaged 24.9 points per game on 50 per cent shooting in eight games played with the 905 and while with the Mississauga club they worked on that reliable shot that's become so familiar to Raptors fans over the last little bit and how to properly play NBA defence.
“I thought they learned how to be aggressive, but not be tunnel-vision, a one-trick pony guy, and that, I think, has really carried over to the big club,” Mermuys said of Powell. “You can see the more minutes that they got up there he's just starting to figure it out. That they can be aggressive, but also still make the right play and make easy plays, and they aren't able to do that when we got him.”
Powell was probably the greatest example of the young Raptors who came down to work on their games making the best use of the opportunity given to them with the 905, but that isn't to say that the likes of Delon Wright and Lucas Nogueira's time down at Hershey Centre was a waste as the freedom provided to them certainly helped them become better players from the start of the year.
“In the D-League there are no veteran guys. It's just a bunch of young guys figuring it out,” Mermuys said. “So you're experimenting, you're failing, you're figuring it out and then you go up there and get some of that mentorship, and it really puts it all together.”
Giant step for Sim
(Chris So/Getty Images)
One of the (pun fully intended) the biggest stories coming into the season was the 905's acquisition of 7-foot-5 Brampton, Ont., native Sim Bhullar.
Fighting through an early-season conditioning stint that wasn't seeing them travel with the team on the road, when they were deemed good to go Bhullar played well, coming up with 10 double-doubles on the year.
The 23-year-old says the chance to play so close to home was a major contributing factor to the success they enjoyed.
“It was huge for me to have my family come out to pretty much every game and to be able to go home and to just be able to have a stable home out here,” Bhullar said. “Most of the coaches I knew from before and it felt good to have them around and a couple of the guys on the team I knew from college and growing up in camps and AAU, so it was a really comfortable feeling when I first got here and I definitely grew a lot of friendships out here. It was great for me having it in my backyard, and having the support that I had was huge for me.”
Rickshaws, perhaps better known now as pedicabs, have come into vogue in recent years as a greener and easier alternative for getting around in crowded American cities. Next week in particular, thousands of visitors will swarm Austin, Texas, for the annual South by Southwest festival, and will likely rely on some 500 or more pedicabbies for transportation between events.
That said, none of those carriages are likely to be as stunning as Eclipse, a new rickshaw concept that its designer Kenneth Cobonpue calls “a more civilized version of the humble three-wheeler.”
In both the United States and in South America and Asia (where Cobonpue's studio is headquartered) modern rickshaw designs haven't evolved much past their original 1800s counterparts–and in some ways, that's okay. Passenger carts are low-tech by definition: they operate off the grid and are used exclusively for short distance travel. At the same time, if rickshaws came with a few more amenities, perhaps their adoption rate would imprive in urban areas.
Cobonpue's proposal includes things that passengers might find on an Amtrak or in a new car: cupholders, an iPhone charging dock, speakers, a fan, and panels that can close. The feel of luxury is meant to extend to the peddler, too: the handlebars and seats are covered in soft, but waterproof, hand-stitched faux leather. The entire vehicle is built from aluminum and a woven polyethylene, so it's both sturdy and lightweight. The piece is in line with Cobonpue's other work, which features woven, hardy, outdoor furniture.
Small creature comforts–like a place to set down your coffee, or not stressing over a dying phone battery–are tactics that other designers are considering when trying to sway behavior patterns. For instance, Fuseproject's recently announced line of outdoor furniture is crafted specifically to make locking up a bike a less physically awkward experience. Likewise, Cobonpue wants riders to think of Eclipse as no less comfortable than a cushy, automobile car. “Lightweight environmentally friendly vehicles using green production techniques and materials are the wave of the future,” Cobonpue tells Co.Design. “The most challenging aspect is getting people to rethink their traditional modes of transportation.”
Explosions and gunfire—once the hallmarks of modern warfare—will soon be a thing of the past. Military initiatives are focusing their efforts on the development of a new weapon that relies on electromagnetic conductors: the railgun.
Now, a team of Russian scientists have successfully tested their first railgun prototype, which they say can fire shells at 3 kilometers per second—fast enough to tear through any type of armor that exists today.
While it shows great promise to become the next generation of military artillery, Russia is eyeing other applications for it, including the possibility of using the gun to bring cargo to the International Space Station (ISS). The railgun is revolutionary in terms of how much it can accelerate the projectile, and tests conducted at the Institute of High Temperatures' branch in Shatura (a location just outside Moscow) demonstrated immense projectile speed—3 km/sec. (1.8 mi/sec.), which is half of what booster rockets need to shirk Earth's gravity.
In addition to Russia, the United States is also working on its own version of the railgun, but their tests have used significantly bigger projectiles. For example, their next sea trial will attempt to fire a 44-lb. (20 kg) projectile at hypersonic speeds. In contrast, Russia's railgun projectile is a thousand times smaller, and reached speeds of 7,200 mph (11,000 km/h).
When you're consuming Spanish in written or spoken form, it's easy to fall into Spectator Mode and spend hours listening or reading without actually producing any Spanish. The best way to avoid this trap is by creating: repeating out loud the content you're consuming.
The first time you repeat a whole sentence, you'll be using your short term memory. This means that a few seconds later, you'll have probably forgotten most of the sentence. After you try to repeat it a couple of times, something interesting happens: you're able to remember the words you're familiar with, but there is always a few that keep slipping. Several repetitions later, you have no problem repeating the whole sentence from memory; in fact, it's so internalized that you can still remember it an hour later.
Getting to that point isn't easy, but it can be incredibly rewarding. By always working at the boundary of what you're capable of, and getting immediate feedback after each attempt, you give your brain all the tools it needs to improve. This constant challenge is at the core of deliberate practice.
In the following video, I help you go through this process sentence by sentence. To make the process of sentence recall easier, I've given you a few words and left the others blank. Think of them as training wheels until you can close your eyes and translate and remember the whole sentence without any extra help.
Hoy vamos a hablar de uno de mis ejercicios favoritos: transcribir frases en español. Mucha gente dice que el español es difícil de entender porque hablamos rapidísimo, pero la velocidad no es el verdadero problema. En una autopista, el problema no es que la gente vaya demasiado rápido, sino que los demás vayan en coche y tú vayas en bici. Vale. Entonces, te estarás preguntando «¿Y dónde consigo el coche?» Si pudieras comprarlo, sería demasiado fácil. Lo que tienes que hacer es añadirle piezas a tu bici hasta que se convierta en un descapotable. La pieza más importante es aprender a distinguir dónde termina una palabra y dónde empieza la siguiente. Y la forma más fácil de conseguirla es consumir contenidos con subtítulos. Es decir, leer a la vez que escuchas. Si estás escuchando algo que no tiene subtítulos, ningún problema: tómatelo como una oportunidad. Transcribir frases en español, es el ejercicio perfecto para mejorar tu capacidad de escucha porque te obliga a ir más despacio. Es un poco irónico, pero para entender a alguien que habla muy rápido, tienes que practicar muy despacio. Tu cerebro es incapaz de ir a toda velocidad por un terreno desconocido. Primero tienes que ir palabra por palabra, sonido por sonido, hasta que te des cuenta de todos los matices. Cada nuevo detalle que descubres te ayuda a procesar la información más rápido. Es como si estuvieras asfaltando una carretera. Mañana por la mañana, vuelve a ver este vídeo, pero esconde los subtítulos. Y cuando escuches una palabra o una frase que no entiendes, intenta transcribirla. Luego puedes ver la respuesta correcta en mi web. Aquí va un consejo muy importante: en vez intentar transcribir el texto entero de un tirón, te recomiendo que empieces con una frase todos los días. Y luego, si quieres hacer más, genial. Pero el objetivo es hacer al menos una frase al día. Hay una parte de tu cerebro que te va a sabotear. Va a decir: «¿Una sola? Con eso no vamos a ningún sitio. Sería mejor que hiciéramos el texto entero hoy para que mañana podamos hacer otra cosa.» ಠ_ಠ Esto es una trampa. No caigas en ella. La clave para salir del purgatorio es enfrentarte a un reto todos los días. Y para poder hacerlo todos los días, la parte saboteadora de tu cerebro tiene que estar completamente convencida de que lo puedes hacer con los ojos cerrados. Aunque te hayas pasado el día entero sin parar, corriendo para arriba y para abajo, siempre puedes usar los cinco minutos mientras esperas el bus para sacar el móvil y transcribir una frase de un podcast en español. Si después de esa frase, te apetece hacer otra, y luego otra, adelante. Pero después de la primera, has cumplido tu misión del día y te puedes ir a dormir con la conciencia tranquila. En resumen, si quieres dejar de ir en bici por la autopista y construirte un coche para entender a todo el mundo, practica transcribiendo frases. Puedes empezar con este vídeo. 😊
Repeat until you've mastered it
The point of this exercise is to help you internalize sentence structures that you're not familiar with. By listening to the native audio, reading the transcription, and repeating each sentence from memory, you're activating different parts of your brain and creating multiple reference points.
The work that you put in now will be a huge help when it's time to have a real conversation.
If you want to practice more, try last week's video: La ciudad.
Juno Temple (Vinyl, The Dark Knight Rises) and Janelle Monae (Hidden Figures, Moonlight) are set for lead roles in an episode of Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams sci-fi anthology series from Ronald D. Moore, Michael Dinner, Bryan Cranston and Sony Pictures TV.
The show, based on short stories by the award-winning novelist, was commissioned by Channel 4, who will air the series later this year in the UK. It will launch on Amazon Prime in the U.S.

Despite society and the world as we know it having collapsed, a massive, automatic product-manufacturing factory continues to operate according to the principles of consumerism – humans consume products to be happy, and in order to consume continuously, they must be denied freedom of choice and free will. When a small band of rebels decides to shut down the factory, they discover they may actually be the perfect consumers after all.
Temple will play Emily, one of the rebels, and Monae appears as Alexis, an Autofac representative.
Jay Paulson (Mad Men, Grimm) and David Lyons (Revolution, ER) will also appear in the episode.
Peter Horton (Grey's Anatomy, American Odyssey) directs the episode written by Travis Beacham (Pacific Rim, Clash of The Titans).
The series features an all-star cast including Steve Buscemi, Greg Kinnear, Mireille Enos, Anna Paquin, Terrence Howard, Timothy Spall, Richard Madden, Holiday Grainger, Jack Reynor, Benedict Wong, Geraldine Chaplin and Bryan Cranston, who also serves as an executive producer on the series.

- Well, they DOES have a seriously powered-up form...
- And they CAN make themselves even stronger...
Buuuut she's probably not a threat to you, Luke. Not unless you kidnapped a princess. That said, Justin Forever is arguably superior to Batman Forever, and is definitely better that Duke Nukem Forever, so... Actually, that doesn't tell us much. Nonetheless, Justin is an acceptable choice.
Tensaided is quoting Rocky IV (or, at least, we can only hope that's what he's doing). I haven't seen it, or indeed any of the Rocky movies, but it's my understanding that Rocky IV ended the cold war. Good job, Rocky! You're a peace making machine!
Seriously, though, I totally need to watch Rocky sometime.
Speaking of things being referenced, panel six is totally referencing Azumanga Daioh. I mean, Dragon Ball Z. Sorry, I get those two confused.

At some point, one must put the fangirl aside and looks deeply into the band you're into. Last December, “Bloodfeather” roared into the car on my way to somewhere, and my brain twisted. It's never fixed itself. The past year's been a hella ride with the band from Cape Cod by way of Brooklyn, and I've loved every second. Because of the mental doors that their music kicked open, I started this blog and developed hundreds of friendships. Now, the band's second collaboration with producer Joel Hamilton, “The Boy Who Died Wolf” is due out Nov. 18. Let's see and hear how Highly Suspect holds up, shall we?
The first thing that must be said is that the new album is truly a symbiotic partnership between producer and band. For the first album ‘Mister Asylum', it seemed like band and producer were curious as to where the material could be twisted in the studio. Joel Hamilton's production kept the sound clean, with minimal background clutter, so that the brilliance of the lyrics and melody stood on their own. The result was kizmet and two Grammy nominations for Highly Suspect, and two nomination nods to Hamilton.
“The Boy Who Died Wolf” is the result of that album getting those Grammy nods. The second time around the band and Hamilton had the breathing space to unleash what they as a team could do with the music. So, Joel Hamilton unfurled a magic carpet of sound that swirls around the inside of your head like a typhoon. They used instruments, gadgets, and whatever was on hand to layer the tracks with sound upon sound. I asked producer Joel Hamilton if they thought there was a ‘bad' song on this album?
“I don't think so. I worked long and hard with those guys to make it stand up straight and be a real follow up. I like every song.”
This knitting of sound begins on the first original release on the album, “My Name Is Human”. It's an out of the gate wave of production layers, tense and loaded with all the bells and whistles. “F.W.Y.T” is a haunted house of a song, and the best example of Hamilton's multi layered technique. “Look Alive, Stay Alive” is an irreverent but brutal punk kick with some wicked drum and bass work from Ryan and Rich. Hamilton and the band go minimalist where needed. “Little One” is a sparse love song, and “Chicago” the piano laced ballad that is the emotional core of the album. “For Billy” is a faster tribute to a friend who died during recording. The previously released single “Serotonia”, Johnny's bluesy ode to California, finds a home on the album, but flows seamlessly with the rest of the material.
A few of the songs address the rock and roll lifestyle that they both claim to love and hate equally. “Postres” is a hilarious piano rocker about fame not changing the band. “Wolf” is in the great tradition of rock road songs of yore, is a ‘fuck you' to the band's doubters. Solo guitar on “Wolf” from Tash of the London Souls shreds. “Viper Strike” is the uncanny punk rap about our current creepy political climate that was so timely the band released it the day after the U.S. presidential elections. The one song that makes me scratch my head is “Send Me An Angel” a strange out of left field remake from the 80's band Real Life. It's cool, but kinda random.
Joel Hamilton and Highly Suspect needed a strong sophomore effort to keep momentum going, and they delivered. “The Boy Who Died Wolf” is due out on Nov. 18, and will be available on all streaming and online music outlets.

The alleged ISIS fanatic authorities say was behind Tuesday's deadly New York City slaughter came to the United States seven years ago from Uzbekistan under the Diversity Visa Program, details of Sayfullo Saipov's travel to America that could become all the more important as President Trump proposes revisions to their “extreme vetting” program.
The Diversity Visa Program, a State Department program which offers a lottery for people from countries with few immigrants in America, drew the ire of Trump early Wednesday morning.
"The terrorist came into our country through what is called the 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program,' a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based," Trump tweeted. "We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems. We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter)."
The DV program makes up to 50,000 immigrant visas available annually, "drawn from random selection among all entries to individuals who are from countries with low rates of immigration" to the U.S., according to the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services website. Applicants must prove they have a clean criminal record, have a high school diploma or its equivalent, or have at least two years of work experience within the past five years in order to qualify.
The program originated as part of a bill introduced in 1990 by Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., then a member of the House. Schumer's measure to make a set number of visas available to “diversity immigrants” from certain countries was absorbed into a larger House immigration bill, which was sponsored by Schumer and 31 others, including several Republicans.
The House legislation passed in a bipartisan – but contested – vote, 231-192, while the Senate version containing the “diversity immigrants” part passed more easily, 89-8, and went on to be signed by then-President George H.W. Bush in 1990.
The program has been in the crosshairs of Congress several times, most recently when the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act, sponsored by Senator Tom Cotton, R-Ark., called for its elimination. The Trump White House came out in support of the bill, calling the DV program “outdated,” adding that it “serves questionable economic and humanitarian interests.”
Schumer responded to Trump's comments early Wednesday, calling on the president to rescind proposed cuts to "vital anti-terrorism funding" in their budget.
“I have always believed and continue to believe that immigration is good for America," the senator said in a statement. "President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which they always seem to do at times of national tragedy, should be focusing on the real solution - anti-terrorism funding - which they proposed cutting in their most recent budget."
On Tuesday after the attack, Schumer kept their post-attack comments to praise of the NYPD.
"Thanks NYPD for rapidly responding to tragic situation downtown. Worried & saddened to hear about injuries & loss of life," they said on Twitter.
Saipov is accused of killing eight people and injuring 11 others when they drove a rented Home Depot truck down a New York City bike lane, plowing into pedestrians, before slamming into a school bus.

The venerated saxophone player Bobby Keys first hooked up with the Rolling Stones on 1969's ‘Let It Bleed.' They were then featured prominently on all of the band's albums through 1973's ‘Goats Head Soup.' Whether Keys was honking out solos or adding layers of soul to Stones recordings, their work became an integral part of this golden period. Although the Texas-born sax machine wasn't limited to Stone recordings – they also perform on songs by Elvis Presley , John Lennon and Lynyrd Skynyrd , among others – they found a perfect home with the band and continues to tour with them. Keys and Keith Richards , in particular, have a lifelong bond, formed the moment they discovered they were born on the same day: Dec. 18, 1943. We celebrate one of rock's greatest sidemen with a list of the Top 10 Bobby Keys Rolling Stones Songs.
10 ‘Casino Boogie' From: ‘Exile on Main St.' (1972) Keys' solo lasts about only 25 seconds on this strung-out ‘Exile' gem, but it brings a red-light-district patina to a song that can't resist rolling around in the dirt. The casual sax is the perfect mirror to Keef's bluesy guitar. Forget proficiency; this is all about feel.
9 ‘All About You' From: ‘Emotional Rescue' (1980) Keith Richards wrote this eye-rolling album-closer about their frustrations with Mick Jagger and, as such, features only Charlie Watts on drums, Ron Wood on backing vocals and Keys on saxophone. After being exiled from the Stones, Keys returned for a few turns on ‘Emotional Rescue.' Their wafting sax dovetails perfectly with Richards' weary vocals.
8 ‘I Got the Blues' From: ‘Sticky Fingers' (1971) Who needs the Memphis horns when you have Keys on sax and Jim Price on trumpet? The pair brings greasy, Stax-syle soul to ‘Sticky Fingers' with their brass parts – first adding support to this sauntering track, and later carrying ‘I Got the Blues' to its mournful finale.
7 ‘Happy' From: ‘Exile on Main St.' (1972) Keys, Keith Richards and producer Jimmy Miller bashed out this ‘Exile' chestnut in about four hours, with Keys playing maracas then overdubbing bits of baritone sax. Keys' blurting baritone sax might not be something you notice the first time you listen to ‘Happy.' But as you begin to dig into the song's elements, you realize that Keys floods the bottom of the song with that grimy sound. It's the soundtrack to those decadent days in the south of France.
6 ‘Live With Me' From: ‘Let it Bleed' (1969) Keys made their Stones debut on this ‘Let It Bleed' track, matching Mick Jagger's rude lyrics with their sneering tenor sax. Key gets to bleed all over ‘Live With Me' for the better part of a minute with a wailing solo. The loose, fluid and free-roving saxophone is the counter-balance to the song's lockstep rhythm. Put together, it's a great groove.
5 ‘Emotional Rescue' From: ‘Emotional Rescue' (1980) Keys gets to have their way with their saxophone here, initially floating jazzy textures through the track's sparse funk, and eventually going toe-to-toe with Keef in a call-and-response solo during the last minute. The Stones finally got around to playing ‘Emotional Rescue' onstage in 2013, including a spotlight solo for Keys.
4 ‘Rip This Joint' From: ‘Exile on Main St.' (1972) The Stones let it rock on this rollicking stunner from 'Exile on Main St.,' complete with not one but two screaming sax solos by Keys. They play both tenor and baritone saxes on the rip-roaring tune, adding roadhouse swagger to a rockabilly journey through the U.S. south. The Stones were merely interpreting American music; Keys, on the other hand, was just playing how a guy from Texas should.
3 ‘Sweet Virginia' From: ‘Exile on Main St.' (1972) This rustic country shuffle gets a double shot of rhythm and blues from Keys' howling saxophone. They take a gritty solo about halfway through (the sax is so hoarse, it sounds like it's infected … it was laid down at Nellcote, after all) and then continues to squeeze the life out of their blurting horn for the duration of the tune. Down and dirty.
2 ‘Brown Sugar' From: ‘Sticky Fingers' (1971) You can't have the Top 10 Bobby Keys Rolling Stones songs without a taste of ‘Brown Sugar.' According to Keys, their 30-second solo on the tenor sax was laid down in one take – stunning, given how the solo is burned into most rock fans' brains; yet it's appropriate, given its raw immediacy. It's been said that Keys approaches saxophone solos like a guitarist, and ‘Brown Sugar''s solo bears that out. It's punchy, rude and dynamic. While Mick Jagger sings about a dirty deed, Keys actually gets down to business.
1 ‘Can't You Hear Me Knocking' From: ‘Sticky Fingers' (1971) Mick Jagger and Keith Richards may take credit for this ‘Sticky Fingers' epic, but we all know it belongs to Mick Taylor and Bobby Keys, who contributed mesmerizing solos during the song's extended jam. And, according to Keys, it was all improvised on the spot; ‘Can't You Hear Me Knocking' wasn't even supposed to have a sax part. But Keys grabbed their horn, and there they are at the three-minute mark, fluttering in between Rocky Dijon's congas, conjuring thoughts of a smoky blues club and spitting fireballs during their 90-second solo. A team player to the end, Keys recedes to punctuate Taylor's majestic turn, only to resurface to get in a few good grimy blurts.

Interbranch protocol is nice, but laughable from this president.
The White House has now become a stickler for protocol, especially when it comes to relations between the two political branches.
The new persnicketiness arises from House speaker John Boehner's invitation to Israeli prime minister Bibi Netanyahu to speak before a joint session of Congress in March. The invite is being denounced as a major breach and new low in Washington because they didn't, as had been the traditional practice with such invitations, coordinate with the White House.

As far as violations of the separation of powers in the Obama era, it's hard to see how this even comes close to registering. Maybe Emily Post wouldn't approve, and with a different administration it would be worth honoring every courtesy, but we are far beyond that now.
President Barack Obama has a notoriously piratical attitude toward Congress. They deliberately and gleefully trampled all over its role as the lawmaking branch, and cast aside their own as the executor of the laws. They have distorted the constitutional order to suit their whim, and now their allies are peeved that John Boehner made a wayward speaking invitation?
According to David Rogers of Politico, the speaker's office had tried to coordinate with the White House on a prior 2011 invitation to Netanyahu and got no response. More to the point: The speaker leads a coequal branch of government.

They can invite or not invite anyone they want, up to and including the president, who is invited to give the State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress only as a matter of tradition. They can invite Phil Robertson or Neil deGrasse Tyson, the archbishop of Canterbury or the pope, just as they please.
The speaker shouldn't have to wait for White House sign-off for their invitations to address the House any more than the White House should coordinate with them whom it invites into the Oval Office.
The invitation kerfuffle is all the more ridiculous because it involves a friend of the United States. David Rogers recounts a tussle over a potential invitation to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987; Democrats played with the idea of having them speak before Congress, before relenting. But Gorbachev represented a committed enemy — albeit one that was changing and on the verge of collapse — while Netanyahu represents an embattled ally.
The context of Netanyahu's visit is, of course, the nuclear talks with Iran. The administration is in a panic to get a deal with Iran, any deal. At this point, it doesn't want to hear a discouraging word from anyone, least of all Netanyahu, who is such a powerful communicator. It's not as though the White House opposes on principle interventions by foreign leaders into our Iran policy.

The same White House huffily standing on protocol over the Netanyahu invitation happily hosted British prime minister David Cameron a couple of weeks ago. At a press conference with President Obama, the British leader spoke out against a bill to impose further sanctions against Iran and even called members of Congress to argue against the idea.
The legislation in question is bipartisan, and reasonable enough. Sponsored by Senators Robert Menendez (D., N.J.) and Mark Kirk (R., Ill.), it would restore sanctions that have been loosened on Iran in the event there is no deal by the new June deadline for negotiations. And it would steadily tighten them thereafter. The White House is worried that the prospect of more sanctions will destroy its delicate dynamic with Iran, although Iran has continued to extend its tentacles in Yemen, Syria, and Iraq without any fear of spooking us.
In a congressional hearing last week, Senator Menendez lambasted the administration line on the sanctions bill that “sounds like talking points that come straight out of Tehran.” That is from a leading foreign-policy voice of the president's own party. At least the unwelcome guest, Bibi Netanyahu, will be more polite.

It's not often that you'll find me sitting in church these days. Due to my hectic travel schedule, the 8:30am service time and my increasing ambivalence about institutional Christianity, my attendance record is rather spotty. But last Sunday there I was, two rows from the back, waiting for the service to start. Normally, it would have been a great time to catch up on email. But I figured the elderly ladies sitting nearby would frown at that. So I picked up a Bible instead. It opened to the Gospel of Luke, where I read the following:
“Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them. Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. Do to others as you would have them do to you. “If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that. And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full. But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because they are kind to the ungrateful and wicked. Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful. (Luke 6:27-36).
This is one of my favorite Bible passages–probably because it is also the most challenging. It flies right in the face of our deepest instincts when threatened by evil. If aliens were to observe human culture today, they would likely conclude that we live by the following code instead:
Love your neighbor–but keep a close eye on him–and hate your enemies, do violence to those who hate you, curse those who curse you and ask God to damn those who mistreat you. If someone slaps you on one cheek, cut off their hand. If someone takes your coat, burn down their house. Don't give to everyone who asks–make sure they deserve your help first. And if anyone takes what belongs to you, bomb them back into the stone age. Better yet, don't wait until they take your stuff. Shock and awe them into oblivion before it's too late.
I don't believe we live by this second code because we are inherently evil. I just think the world is a violent, scary place. So it's only natural we would want to protect ourselves–preemptively striking those who appear to be a threat, if need be. However, in the midst of our fear-driven lives, what we tend to forget is that violent behavior motivated by fear can only lead to one thing–escalation. Consider this conversation from the closing scene of Batman Begins:
Batman: We can bring Gotham back. Lieutenant Gordon: What about escalation? Batman: Escalation? Gordon: We start carrying semi-automatics, they buy automatics. We start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor-piercing rounds. Batman: And… Gordon: And you're wearing a mask, jump off of rooftops. Take this guy… Armed robbery, double-homicide, got a taste for the theatrical, like you. Leaves a calling card. (Hands the Joker's calling card to Batman.) Batman: I'll look into it.
The next film in the trilogy, The Dark Knight, reveals Gordon's wisdom and Batman's naivety. Batman is confident he's using the right tool–violence–to control crime. They just hasn't applied it to the appropriate degree. When the Joker shows up, they demonstrate not only the foolishness of Batman's thinking but also the kind of person Batman must become if he's truly going to win the arms race against evil. The Joker knows the only way Batman can defeat them is to become like him; and he's über-confident that Batman doesn't have the guts.
I think we live under a similar delusion. We think we really can win this precarious game of one-upmanship against our enemies–never stopping to consider what kind of people that will require us to become. At what point do the violent acts done in the name of “civilization” cause us to ask whether a civilization whose existence demands such bloodshed is worth protecting? At what point do we realize we are engaged in nothing more than “mutually assured damnation”?
Worse, we project this same logic onto God. We may lose the arms race in the end, but God has infinite resources, so we believe God will bring about the final, ultimate, violent victory over our enemies in hell. This seems to fit perfectly with the “code of human civilization” I outlined above. Not so much with the teaching of Jesus. Because if this is the way God finally deals with evil, I have some questions for God, namely, “If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that.”
Rather than grant divine sanction to our fear-driven survival instincts, I believe Jesus is describing the only possible way out of this vicious cycle. And it's not by delivering the final, knockout blow against our enemies. It's by absorbing that blow instead. This may kill us–as it killed Jesus. But I'm confident that our refusal to play the game–our refusal to be an enemy–will eventually encourage our enemies to do the same.

"Ambush" is the first episode of Season One of Star Wars: The Clone Wars. It is the first episode of the series overall. Before its television premiere, the episode was shown on the Television Critics Association press tour on July 11, 2008[1] and later at Dragon Con in Atlanta, Georgia in September.[2] "Ambush" aired on Cartoon Network on October 3, 2008. Though it is the first episode of the series, "Ambush" is the sixth episode chronologically, being preceded by the later episode "Supply Lines".[3]

Official description Edit
Jedi Master Yoda is on a secret mission to forge a treaty with the King of the strategic system of Toydaria when their ship is ambushed by Count Dooku. Yoda and three Clone troopers must face off against Count Dooku's dreaded assassin Ventress and their massive droid army to prove the Jedi are strong enough to protect the king and their people from the forces of the war.
Plot summary Edit
Episode I
AMBUSH A galaxy divided by war! Peaceful worlds must choose sides or face the threat of invasion. Republic and Separatist armies vie for the allegiance of neutral planets. Desperate to build a Republic supply base on the system of Toydaria, Jedi Master Yoda travels to secret negotiations on a remote neutral moon....
Jedi Master Yoda is dispatched to the dried coral moon of Rugosa to convince King Katuunko to allow the Republic to build a base in Toydarian territory. As the Toydarian monarch King Katuunko and their retinue await the arrival of their Jedi envoy, Asajj Ventress arrives and presents Katuunko with a hologram of Count Dooku, who attempts to express the Jedi's supposed incapability to protect Toydaria in hopes of swaying the king to their cause. In orbit of the Rugosa moon, two Banking clan frigates ambush Yoda's ship, forcing them to take an escape pod while their ship escapes the system. Three clones—Lieutenant Thire, Jek and Rys—accompany them to the surface.
The Republic frigate leaves the system, a move that Asajj Ventress spins to the king as a sign of weakness. I attempts at persuasion are interrupted however by a holographic call from Yoda, in which the Jedi Master offers their greetings. Ventress then suggests a deal: if Yoda can escape their best troops, then Toydaria will be free to join the Republic. But if they should fail and the droids prevail, Toydaria will join the Separatists.
Agreeing to Ventress' proposal, Yoda and their troops march through the coral forest as a Separatist landing ship carrying a full battalion of droids arrives. Yoda and their men then face off against a large number of droids and several tanks. The tanks find it difficult to penetrate the dense coral forest, forcing the droid commander 224 to send their troops out on foot, which allows the clones to ambush them in small groups. Eventually, Thire is wounded, and the group is forced to retreat.
Yoda and the clones make their way to a dried gulch lined with caves, to rest and recover. Inside a cave, the clones are less than enthusiastic about their current situation, as they find themselves outnumbered and outgunned. To raise spirits, Yoda gives their troopers a small lesson about them being individuals despite their origin as clones, and that it is their mind which makes them strong, not their numbers or weapons.
As the droid column approaches, Master Yoda decides to face them alone, ordering their troops to stay out of sight until their help is truly needed. The droids report the current situation to Ventress, who in turn orders them to open fire. Yoda ends up cutting the whole battalion to pieces, and angered, Ventress sends out ten droidekas to deal with the Jedi Master. Just before the droidekas can finish the Jedi Master, Thire launches their last rocket at an overhanging bluff, sending an avalanche of rock crashing down on the droideka reinforcements.
Katuunko is impressed by the display, and opts to have Toydaria join the Republic. Furious about the outcome, Dooku orders Ventress to kill the king. Ventress knocks the king's Toydarian royal guards unconscious and prepares to deal the killing blow, but Master Yoda arrives just in time, stopping Ventress mid-swing. Rather than surrender, Ventress quickly triggers an avalanche with pre-planted explosive charges, using it as a distraction to escape in their solar sailer. King Katuunko gladly accepts Yoda's offer to join the Republic, and Republic gunships come to retrieve the group.

Reception Edit
"Ambush" marked the series' debut on October 3, 2008. It brought in 3.96 million viewers,[4] and was Cartoon Network's most watched series premiere.[5]
Behind the scenes Edit
"So we do things far better in a late episode in Season One than we did in the movie, for the theatrical release of Clone Wars. So I think there were some kind of juxtapositional episodes based on that. You know, we all liked the Yoda episode, 'Ambush in the Outer Rim', and I thought that we all felt that, you know, fans had never really seen something that was that Yoda-specific before, but um, you know, we all felt it would be a really strong way to start the series with a really fun episode about Yoda." ―Director Dave Filoni, during an interview
The episode's original name was "Ambush in the Outer Rim."[6] Its title was first revealed by Henry Gilroy in an interview that featured in Star Wars Insider 103.[7]
The original moral of this episode was supposed to be, "Great leadership comes in all sizes."[8]
"Ambush" was originally not supposed to be aired as the first episode of Season One, but the episodes' order was changed very close to the series' premiere.[9][10]
Almost two years after the original airing of "Ambush", a prequel episode titled "Supply Lines" aired on September 24, 2010 as part of season three. It revealed the Republic's original purpose to use Toydaria as a staging ground to help the Twi'leks and supply them with food and medical supplies, which intertwined with the Ryloth Trilogy of episodes which aired later on in Season One.

Even if you filter all email into a "trusted trio" of folders or rely on Gmail's smart priority inbox feature, you might still have an overwhelming number of emails requiring your attention. To be more productive, focus on the "Wheelhouse" emails.

Megan Morris writes on the Productive Flourishing blog that after doing email triage, two categories of emails were left: Wheelhouse emails, which Morris says "were associated with tasks that I knew I could do better than anyone else on the planet," and peripheral emails—all the other stuff, "items that I knew took me a little more time, or weren't my most efficient or preferred territory."
Prioritizing important emails this way, with more focus on and immediate attention to Wheelhouse emails, can help you make the best use of your time and more of a difference in the world, perhaps. After dealing with the "highest leverage items," come back to the peripheral ones.

As someone whose priority inbox is overflowing, I could use another strategy for dealing with email overload. What do you think?

Korra - Avatar: Legend of KorraBook 2 CostumeCosplay made and worn by * the-mirror-melts Photo by ~ RocknamLee Taken at Otakon 2012 - Habour fountainI finished up their season 2 costume in time for Otakon 2012. I also dyed and straightened my hair for the occasion. It was horribly humid that weekend, so my hair was a mess by the end of the day. Luckily my shoot was first thing in the morning.The top is made out of quilting cotton with little stretch. I didn't have time to add fasteners so I sewed myself into the costume in the morning and cut myself out of it in the afternoon. Fasteners wouldn't hold down the fabric as flush as I would want it, so I will be remaking the top with spandex for a better fit once I find the right shade. Those are new, more accurate hair-clips, plus I trimmed the fur on the shall. My pants are photographing very light, probably due to the texture and the contrast with the other blues, so I may have to remake those as well.More Korra
Climate change is melting Arctic sea ice, leaving animals that depend on it high and dry. Marine mammals like ringed seals have to find new areas to give birth, raise their young, and haul out. And now, experts say, these animals must deal with another woe—emerging diseases.
Ice-free parts of the Arctic seem to be opening up new areas for more than just shipping companies. A new species of parasite, Sarcocystis pinnipedi, is on the move south, infecting gray seals and killing off as much as 20 percent of a population on a single island, researchers reported at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting on February 13.
This new parasite is a close cousin of S. canis, which can afflict bears and cause hepatitis or encephalitis in young dogs.

Parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii, found in cat feces and kitty litter, are also finding new areas of opportunity, making their way north and infecting beluga whales.
"Climate change is an unprecedented opportunity for pathogens to shift to new environments and cause new diseases," says Michael Grigg, chief of molecular parasitology at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland. (See "New Diseases, Toxins Harming Marine Life.")
Naive Populations
Toxoplasma is common in every warm-blooded vertebrate species, says Grigg. But now researchers have found it for the first time in a Beaufort Sea (map) population of beluga whales. Retrospective studies on beluga samples indicate the parasite first showed up there in 2006.
Treating the hardy parasite with chlorine bleach—the usual method—or storing it in dilute sulfuric acid won't kill it. The only way to get rid of Toxoplasma, says Grigg, is to boil or freeze it. But with fewer days below freezing in the Arctic, it has a greater chance of surviving until it reaches a host than it would have if temperatures weren't rising.
Scientists aren't sure how the parasite got to the Arctic, but the prevalence of cats in human settlements in the region could have something to do with it: Infectious stages of Toxoplasma are released in cat feces. Somehow those parasites are making their way to the ocean—likely via waterways—and infecting the whales.
Experts face an equally challenging puzzle as a new parasite species—the crescent-shaped S. pinnipedi—emerges in gray seals.
The Arctic's disappearing sea ice has allowed gray seals to come together with ringed seals, says Grigg. As warmer ocean temperatures bring forage fish like cod and capelin farther north than before, says U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration biological oceanographer Sue Moore, gray seals are following the food-and encountering ringed seals.
And as both species pursue the same fish, S. pinnipedi can now move from its normal host—the ringed seal—into gray seals, which have never encountered it before.
Like a Cancer
In 2012, S. pinnipedi was blamed for the deaths of 406 gray seals on Hay Island (map) in Nova Scotia. Two were adults. The rest were pups two to three weeks old—a major blow to the reproductive potential of this 2,000-seal population, says Grigg.
The parasite acts like a cancer in gray seals, they explain. Normally, this kind of organism replicates inside a host until something tells it to switch to a slow-growing, cyst-forming stage that lets it infect its next host.
But that doesn't happen in gray seals. The parasite just keeps replicating in the liver until it completely destroys the organ. (Ringed seals have evolved to live with S. pinnipedi and don't seem to suffer the same fate.)
View Images Images of Sarcocystis pinnipedi (purple dots on left, dark gray spots on right) infecting the liver of a gray seal. Both show evidence of heavy inflammation. PHOTOGRAPH BY DR. PIERRE YVES-DAOUST
Grigg says the researchers who found the dead gray seal pups didn't see anything obviously wrong at first. But necropsies showed that their livers had been demolished.
A "New Normal"
Once researchers understood that S. pinnipedi had killed the gray seals, they looked to see if it had caused trouble elsewhere. They now think it also killed a stellar sea lion in the Gulf of Alaska in 2004, and two Hawaiian monk seals in 2010 and 2011. But they still don't know how the parasite got so far south.
Now Grigg and their colleagues are trying to understand S. pinnipedi's life cycle. To do so, they're collecting feces from ringed seals and their predators, polar bears.
Unfortunately, Grigg thinks there's nothing humans can do to halt these parasites. "It's just a new normal" that everyone, including the animals, will have to learn to live with, they said.
For gray seals, they add, it could be a decade or two before they develop any kind of immunity against S. pinnipedi.
But "eventually," they say, "we'll come to some [kind of] balance."
A former Fine Gael local election candidate has been criticised for suggesting that the residents of Apollo House should have all services cut off and be “frozen out” of the building.
William Whittle, who stood in the Edenderry electoral area of Co Offaly in the 2014 local elections, tweeted: “#apollohouse Cut all services off, freeze them out of it.”
They tweeted it before the occupants of the vacant Dublin office building, a group of homeless people and activists known as Home Sweet Home, agreed to leave Apollo House on Thursday morning.
Their tweet drew a critical response from Home Sweet Home on Twitter: “Thank your for your compassion for vulnerable people in #apollohouse looking for suitable shelter and a #homesweethome.”
#apollohouse cut all services off, freeze them out of it... — william whittle (@wcwhittle) January 11, 2017 #apollohouse it's amazing to see how many faceless people are out there afraid to put their face to their comments, that says it all — william whittle (@wcwhittle) January 11, 2017
Mr Whittle responded: “You're (an) absolute disgrace trespassing on state property”.
Later, after receiving a lot of negative comments, they tweeted: “It's amazing to see how many faceless people are out there afraid to put their face to their comments, that says it all.”
On their Twitter page, Mr Whittle has a profile photograph of themselves with the EU commissioner Phil Hogan. They also have a photograph on their Twitter feed with Taoiseach Enda Kenny.
Mr Whittle was listed on the official Offaly County Council local election website as living in Bracknagh, Co Kildare and their occupation is listed as fitter/welder.
In the 2014 local election, they received just 336 votes (3.8 per cent of the total poll) and was eliminated.
Mr Whittle could not be contacted for comment.
A Fine Gael spokesperson said the party distanced itself from their remarks. “Those views do not represent the views of Fine Gael. Minister Simon Coveney's top priority continues to be the provision of safe and suitable accommodation for all homeless people,” they said.
T. Colin Campbell says he'll reverse your cancer
My husband had a heart attack over ten years ago. At that time, we decided to clean up our diet and follow a vegetarian plan to help control their blood numbers. This change came at the recommendation of their cardiologist, based on the work of a certain Dr. Dean Ornish. We worked diligently with our docs, particularly our family doctor, as their blood numbers improved, weight dropped, and they slowly, but surely regained their health.
OK. I know. In retrospect, Ornish is a tad… er… flowery. I acknowledge that. However, their lifestyle has worked well for us. Maury and has maintained their life changes for over ten years. In fact, they just aced their latest stress tests. Turns out the whole, watch your diet, exercise, and learn how to handle stress kinda/sorta works… for now.
Whether their current status is due to vegetarianism is debatable. The reason I bring this up is because our vegetarian lifestyle has attracted some very interesting people … particularly the “vegans.”
People who call themselves “vegan” are those who eat zero animal products whatsoever. No dairy, no eggs, they won't wear leather, drink many beers (not even my fruity beer!), won't use products tested on animals, it's an all encompassing lifestyle that once fascinated me.
Interestingly, something new has popped up in this tight knit, yet growing community the last few years: vegans are now claiming to be immune to most, if not all, diseases. I likely wouldn't have noticed these phenomena had it not been for my recent cancer diagnosis. However, when I saw not one, but two, vegan guru-wannabes proclaim they both had cancer and their clean vegan diet had “dissolved” their “tumors” my ears perked up. Sadly, neither will disclose any details of said cancers so I don't know how far the alleged disease had progressed.
Shortly thereafter, another vegan guru-wannabe, an aerobics instructor, advised their large Facebook following to eschew their doctor recommended mammograms because they had to wait an entire weekend for their results. Waiting that long gave them the sads. Plus, they implied, vegans are immune to cancer, so why get mammograms?
What?
Well, it turns out, these folks are basing their skewed recommendations on the work of a certain T. Colin Campbell, Professor Emeritus of Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University.
Campbell is also the author of The China Study which details:
…the connection between nutrition and heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Recognized as the most comprehensive nutritional study ever conducted on the relationship between diet and the risk of developing disease, The China Study cuts through the haze of misinformation and examines the source of nutritional confusion produced by government entities, lobbies, and opportunistic scientists. The China Study, a national bestseller co-authored by Dr. Campbell and their son, Thomas M. Campbell, MD, has sold more than 1 million copies since it was first published in 2005. It is the foundation upon which a nationwide plant-based diet movement is based. The China Study presents a clear and concise message of hope as it dispels a multitude of health myths and misinformation. The science is clear. If you want to be healthy, change your diet.
Yay! The science is clear. Crystal clear. I can expect to pick up a copy of every woman's magazine at the grocery store and each will proclaim this clear truth… right?
But Campbell goes even further. In an interview with Kathy Freston, article titled “A Cure For Cancer? Eating A Plant-Based Diet” on the Huffington Post (I know. Consider the source), Campbell says:
Although the initiated cells are not considered to be reversible, the cells growing through the promotion stage are usually considered to be reversible, a very exciting concept. This is the stage that especially responds to nutritional factors. For example, the nutrients from animal based foods, especially the protein, promote the development of the cancer whereas the nutrients from plant-based foods, especially the antioxidants, reverse the promotion stage. This is a very promising observation because cancer proceeds forward or backward as a function of the balance of promoting and anti-promoting factors found in the diet, thus consuming anti-promoting plant-based foods tend to keep the cancer from going forward, perhaps even reversing the promotion. The difference between individuals is almost entirely related to their diet and lifestyle practices.
And…
Our work showed that casein is the most relevant cancer promoter ever discovered.
And this:
Among other fundamental effects, it makes the body more acidic, alters the mix of hormones and modifies important enzyme activities, each of which can cause a broad array of more specific effects. One of these effects is its ability to promote cancer growth (by operating on key enzyme systems, by increasing hormone growth factors and by modifying the tissue acidity). Another is its ability to increase blood cholesterol (by modifying enzyme activities) and to enhance atherogenesis, which is the early stage of cardiovascular disease. And finally, although these are casein-specific effects, it should be noted that other animal-based proteins are likely to have the same effect as casein.
I thought the alkaline diet hypothesis had been debunked. I guess some information dies hard. Anyway… tell me more about casein:
I would first say that casein is not just “intrinsic” but IS THE MAIN PROTEIN OF COW MILK, REPRESENTING ABOUT 87% OF THE MILK PROTEIN. The biochemical systems which underlie the adverse effects of casein are also common to other animal-based proteins. Also, the amino acid composition of casein, which is the characteristic primarily responsible for its property, is similar to most other animal-based proteins. They all have what we call high ‘biological value', in comparison, for example, with plant-based proteins, which is why animal protein promotes cancer growth and plant protein doesn't.
What if we don't eat pure casein? Suppose we drink milk, which also contains lactose, calcium, water, and such. What if we don't consume all that much dairy?
I rather like the expression told by my friend, Caldwell Esselstyn, Jr., MD, the Cleveland Clinic surgeon who reversed heart disease and who says, “Moderation kills!” I prefer to go the whole way, not because we have fool-proof evidence showing that 100% is better than, say, 95% for every single person for every single condition but that it is easier to avoid straying off on an excursion that too often becomes a slippery slope back to our old ways. Moreover, going the whole way allows us to adapt to new unrealized tastes and to rid ourselves of some old addictions. And finally, moderation often means very different things for different people.
Never mind. Moderation kills, evidently.
And here's the money quote:
KF: Are you saying that if one changes their diet from animal based protein to plant-based protein that the disease process of cancer can be halted and reversed? TCC: Yes, this is what our experimental research shows. I also have become aware of many anecdotal claims by people who have said that their switch to a plant-based diet stopped even reversed (cured?) their disease. One study on melanoma has been published in the peer-reviewed literature that shows convincing evidence that cancer progression is substantially halted with this diet.
Well, there you have it. Cancer can not only be prevented, but reversed with a Campbell-approved plant based diet.
More quotes:
TCC: It is not clear because carefully designed research in humans has not been done. However, we demonstrated and published findings showing that experimental progression of disease is at least suspended, even reversed, when tumors are clearly present.
KF: Consider a person who has been eating poorly their whole life; is there still hope that a dietary change can make a big difference? Or is everything already in motion? TCC: Yes, a variety of evidence shows that cancers and non-cancers alike can be stopped even after consuming a poor diet earlier in life. This effect is equivalent to treatment, a very exciting concept.
A cure? That's an extraordinary claim.
KF: This is sounding like it's a cure for cancer; is that the case? TCC: Yes. The problem in this area of medicine is that traditional doctors are so focused on the use of targeted therapies (chemo, surgery, radiation) that they refuse to even acknowledge the use of therapies like nutrition and are loathe to even want to do proper research in this area. So, in spite of the considerable evidence–theoretical and practical–to support a beneficial nutritional effect, every effort will be made to discredit it. It's a self-serving motive.
Well. I'm going to have a word with my oncologist about this. Why on earth wouldn't all the major cancer centers be jumping all over this new revelation? Wait. I did talk to him. Here's what they said about Campbell's research, it's a pretty short analysis because he's busy working with patients, not trying to sell books (also, I'm paraphrasing since I don't recall their exact words):
Campbell claims to have (1) stopped/reversed one kind of cancer, (2) in one organ (liver), (3) in genetically modified rats by (4) adding and subtracting one kind of isolated “animal” protein. Problem is (1) there are many kinds of cancer, each reacting differently to various treatments. (2) Humans have many organs. A cancer in one organ will react differently to that same type of cancer in a different one. (3) Humans are not genetically modified rats. (4) Few people eat isolated casein (milk protein). Plus, to lump all forms of protein under one umbrella isn't exactly correct.
So, there you have it. But what do other people have to say? Turns out Harriet Hall from Science Based Medicine has a bit to say on this subject.
Concerning Campbell's research, Hall mentions instances of:
sloppy citations
conflicting data
higher Chinese stomach cancer rates
straw man arguments
They conclude:
It would be wonderful if we could prevent cancer and all those other diseases by avoiding animal protein. It would have the extra added benefit to the environment of increasing the productivity of agricultural land and reducing the greenhouse effects of gassy cows. I look forward to future well-designed studies investigating the effects of very low protein and animal-protein-free diets. Meanwhile, The China Study makes a good case, but the case isn't quite good enough.
Interesting, eh?
A year later, Hall revisited the subject. Turns out a young woman by the name of Denise Minger crunched some China Study numbers and found a few interesting tidbits.
Minger goes on to reveal gaping logical holes in Campbell's own research on casein, a milk protein that they believe causes cancer. They showed that casein was associated with cancer when given in isolation to lab animals, but they project those results onto humans and onto all sources of animal protein. Other animal proteins have been shown to have anti-cancer effects, and the results of a normal diet containing multiple protein sources are likely to be very different from their casein-only studies.
I think Hall's takeaway from this discussion is spot on:
This is a cautionary tale. It shows how complex issues can be over-simplified into meaninglessness, how epidemiologic data can be misinterpreted and mislead us, and how a researcher can approach a problem with preconceptions that allow them to see only what they want to see. The China Study was embraced by vegetarians because it seemed to support their beliefs with strong evidence. Minger has shown that that evidence is largely illusory. The issues raised are important and deserve further study by unbiased scientists. At any rate, one thing is clear: the China Study is not sufficient reason to recommend drastic reductions in protein intake, let alone total avoidance of meat and dairy foods.
So, where does that leave the heart attack guy married to the cancer chick? We met with their cardiologist last week and discussed vegetarianism (not veganism), cancer, and long term health. Their recommendation? Stay the path. “Nearly any diet that eliminates junk is a good thing,” they said. As long as it's nutritionally sound, you have firm nutritional boundaries, and can stick to them long term, keep going.”
As for cancer? Their reply was the same as my oncologist: If you're gonna get it, you're gonna get it. You can reduce your odds with some lifestyle changes (maybe) but you'll never eliminate them.
Dang. Isn't reality a bitch? I wish I could eat a particular diet and become cancer proof. I guess if it's too good to be true…
However, fantasy is a great way to sell books, seminars, pricy university “certificates” and give a lot of people false hope. Imagine if you were a “healthy vegan” who avoid the “Industrial Medical Complex” based on China Study data and wound up in a life threatening situation? That easily could have been me had I listened to Campbell rather than get my routine colonsocopy.
I'll take my family doc's recommendation over an anonymous Internet “doctor” any day. But from what I read on my Facebook page, I'm definitely in the minority. I guess it's time to cull the Facebook herd again, eh?
CLOSE Michael Orr, VP of programs for Aerojet Rocketdyne Coleman Aerospace, discusses the company's move into a refurbished facility at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Posted 2-24-2017

An Air Force C-17 aircraft opens its cargo door at 25,000 feet, a parachute shoots out and a carriage holding a simulated ballistic missile is yanked out into the sky.
The carriage releases the missile, which falls free before lighting a solid-fueled motor and rocketing away on a suborbital trajectory.
Within minutes, a live missile intercepts the air-launched target low in space, or as it reenters the atmosphere, and blows it to bits — if the U.S. Missile Defense Agency test is successful.
“We are shooting a bullet with a bullet, miles in the sky,” said Dan Kelly, president of Coleman Aerospace, which builds and launches target vehicles for such tests. “The bullet we're knocking down is a bullet that wants to bring harm to us.”
Orlando-based Coleman on Friday cut the ribbon on a refurbished 15,000 square-foot facility at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station where it will assemble target missiles, relocating work previously performed in Yuma, Arizona.

The 150-person company, acquired this week by Aerojet Rocketdyne from L3 Technologies for $15 million, will base about 20 employees at the facility in the Cape's Area 57 for each test missile assembled.
“With the addition of this facility, all that work will stay in the state of Florida,” said Kelly.
The state Department of Transportation, through Space Florida, contributed $600,000 to modernize the mothballed building that once processed solid motors for Delta II rockets.
“It's come a long way,” said Kelly. “This is a state-of-the-art facility at this point.”
Coleman has launched 34 target missiles since 1995 from the ground and air. The single- or two-stage rockets use decommissioned Peacekeeper and Minuteman motors provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne to simulate short- and long-range ballistic missiles.
The business aspires to grow beyond its missile defense mission to offer commercial launches for the growing small satellite market, using a planned three-stage, air-launched rocket called Hera II.
There's no target date for a satellite launch, and the company had no estimate of how many more jobs that work might add, but the Cape facility is key to the strategy.
“It really is part of the vision of growing the company,” said Kelly. “Because we can build up to six targets in this facility at one time.”
The missile targets, depending on the number of stages, measure roughly 35 feet long and weigh about 50,000 pounds.
Once the Cape facility opens in April, stages weighing about 17,000 pounds will be trucked in and unloaded onto raised rails where the target is assembled, tested and lifted by crane onto a carrier. From there, it will be transported less than a mile to a C-17 at the Cape's Skid Strip for flight to wherever the test is being performed, often near Hawaii.
The company's last mission was flown there on Halloween last year, where it was one of multiple targets launched.
“The ground crew, they don't know if it's an exercise or it's real, because they run exercises all the time,” said Kelly. “Everything looks real on the screen.”
The mood in the control room is tense as the target missile is dropped. Engineers hope to see the engines light and hear the words, “Good target, we have a good target.”
"We do our part," said Kelly, “and they knock us out of the air.”

You've probably heard the newest weight-loss secret — and maybe you've even tried it yourself: Drop 10 pounds "instantly" by giving up wheat. When Annakeara Stinson, a 26-year-old who lives in New York City, heard about it, they thought she'd found the secret to staying thin. "I was in my last semester at school and so stressed out. There was no way I could stay as fit as I had gotten over the summer." They headed to the doctor complaining of stomach problems, and they suggested they could be linked to the wheat protein gluten. They happily went gluten-free.
One month later, 15 pounds lighter, and raking in "You look great!" squeals, they veered into dangerous territory. She'd eat spinach and spoonfuls of almond butter — and nothing else — for dinner. They were irritable and fatigued, and their skin looked unhealthy and gray. "My gluten intolerance became an easy excuse for what turned into an eating disorder," they admit.
Not everyone who has food allergies or intolerances has an eating disorder. Far from it — allergies are real and can be life-threatening. But potential allergies run the gamut from sugar, nuts, and animal proteins (including eggs and dairy products) to nightshade veggies (potatoes, peppers, tomatoes, eggplant), soy, and gluten. And some women are now claiming allergies to food groups not out of a necessity for their health but to justify going on restrictive, often dangerous diets to lose weight. An allergy can provide a cover for a warped relationship with food. No one will question your shunning that pizza if it's because your doctor told you to avoid it.
The Goop Effect
When some svelte celeb, like Gwyneth Paltrow or Megan Fox, comes out hailing the wheat- or dairy-free gods, we take note. Ditch these devil foods and downsize to starlet proportions. And with dozens of diet books and cookbooks promising that cutting a food group will make you thin and healthy — Sugar Busters,Wheat Belly,The G-Free Diet — and even doctors and nutritionists encouraging Americans to get blood tests that uncover food allergies and sensitivities, the trend has some expert cred behind it.
No wonder one-third of us think we have a food allergy. And yet only 4 percent of us really do, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "Many people are avoiding foods because of misunderstandings, not true allergies," says Scott Sicherer, MD, of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. For example, maybe you eat a plate of pasta, feel sluggish, then blame wheat, or you feel ill after finishing a bowl of mint chip, then vow to go sugar-free. In reality, maybe you just ate too much.
Maybe, says Dr. Sicherer, we're confusing intolerances with allergies. With an allergy, your immune system goes into attack mode against a certain food, like lobster or peanuts. Your body releases histamines that can cause red, itchy skin, swollen eyes, dizziness, or wheezing. Food allergies are no joke: They send more than 30,000 people to the ER every year.
An intolerance is different. Your body may lack the enzyme to digest milk properly, creating lactose intolerance. Or you may be sensitive to gluten — a protein found in wheat and other grains — and experience gastrointestinal symptoms like bloating, gas, or diarrhea. About 1 percent of the U.S. population has an extreme form of gluten intolerance known as celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder in which gluten damages the small intestine and interferes with nutrient absorption. If you have an allergy, eating the food can, in some cases, be life-threatening — even in tiny amounts. You can see why you'd have to eliminate it from your diet. But with an intolerance, you may be able to eat dairy, gluten, sugar, or eggs in limited amounts without issues. And you may be able to reintroduce the food into your diet in the future.
Weight-Loss Miracle?
More women are crossing their fingers hoping they have a food allergy or intolerance to sugar, dairy, wheat, or whatever, says Lauren Schmitt, RD, a nutritionist in Studio City, California. "Some see it as the answer to losing weight or something that will force them to do so. Or they may blame an inability to lose weight on a food intolerance," they say.
Allergies make the perfect scapegoat. "It's a judgment-free way to have an unhealthy relationship with food that's socially acceptable," says psychiatrist Kim Dennis, MD, the medical director of Timberline Knolls, a residential treatment center in Lemont, Illinois. Pass up nachos with the girls and it's no biggie if you're dairy-free. But if you say you're skipping them because you don't want to get fat, your friends will be on your case.
Plus, allergies (whether they're real or fake) can provide a rigid structure and sense of control that women with eating disorders crave. Even when intentions start out healthy, if you have enough willpower to skip cupcakes, wine, and tomato sauce because you're sensitive to sugar — and you lose weight — then how far can you go? What other "bad" foods can you eliminate? You can fixate on being a perfect, clean eater.
That's what happened to Stinson, whose eating habits became so strict that they lost their period, a condition called amenorrhea that's associated with infertility and osteoporosis. "One of my doctors asked me if I had an eating disorder. And I said, 'No! I'm just gluten-free,' and that was the end of the conversation. My doctor bought it," Stinson recalls.
Diagnosis Fail
"It's easy to go to a doctor looking to be told you have an allergy and have that validated. Some make tons of money running allergy tests that may not be medically necessary," says Dr. Dennis. Another tack: Self-diagnosing, then cutting out certain foods. After all, no one dies from ditching crackers and bread.
Still, axing entire food groups without input from a doctor or dietitian means you may not get all the nutrients you need to feel your best. For example, eliminate wheat and you may lack fiber and energizing B vitamins. Cut out dairy and you may fall short on bone-building calcium and mood-boosting vitamin D.
Assuming you're healthy, there's also no evidence that restrictive diets like gluten-free are the path to skinny, finds a study in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Research shows that diets, especially ones that make you feel deprived of your favorite foods, can cause cravings, trigger binges, and cause you to regain the weight — and then some.
If you have reason to suspect that you have a food intolerance, you need a team on your side to diagnose and treat you. At minimum, don't give yourself a life sentence against a food you love for no reason.
Ask your doctor for a referral to a board-certified allergy specialist who can pinpoint problem-causing foods. A registered dietitian specializing in allergies and sensitivities can develop a healthy diet for you. And if you suspect you have an eating disorder, talk to a specialist. (Get started using the free chat line at NationalEatingDisorders.org.) Warning signs that something may be up include an obsession with eating clean, a long list of foods that are off-limits and a short list of what's okay, and withdrawal from friends and family.
Today, Stinson focuses on listening to their body. "Sometimes it feels good to have sweets, and sometimes I want veggies," they say. "But I know that there's no point in putting so much pressure on myself."
Is It An Allergy, Intolerance, or Eating Disorder?
Signs can be similar — here's how to tell what you're up against.
Allergy
What it feels like: Hives, swelling, itchy eyes, runny nose, sneezing, wheezing, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fainting — adult allergies are most commonly caused by peanuts, tree nuts (like almonds), and seafood.
Symptoms occur:Within minutes or up to two hours after eating the food.
Diagnosis: Your doc will do a medical history and physical exam, followed by skin-prick tests.
Intolerance
What it feels like: Sugar and dairy trigger bloating, gas, diarrhea, nausea, and cramps. Gluten can cause stomach issues, fatigue, and depression. Chocolate and caffeine can bring on headaches. Histamine-containing foods like cheese, red wine, and yeast breads cause headaches, rapid heart rate, flushing, fainting, and wheezing.
Symptoms occur:Hours to days after eating.
Diagnosis: Elimination diet (avoid the food for a certain amount of time), followed by reintroduction (eat possible offenders to pinpoint triggers). Consult your MD to try this successfully.
Disordered Eating
What it feels like: Strict avoidance of foods that aren't seen as clean or pure—including artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives, animal products, pesticides, fat, sugar, and salt — in order to control weight and not because of an intolerance or moral objection to these foods. Often linked to an eating disorder called orthorexia, aka an obsession with a healthy diet in the name of weight loss.
Symptoms occur: Gradually over a long period of time.
Diagnosis: See an MD or dietitian who specializes in eating disorders.

A violent robbery at Barcelona Wine Bar at the Westside Ironworks on Howell Mill Road has left one person dead.
According to 11Alive News, three men entered the restaurant just before 1:45 a.m. Sunday, tied up employees with electrical tape, and forced a 29-year-old female employee upstairs to open a safe.
When police arrived, they found the woman shot once in the shoulder. They were transported to Grady Memorial Hospital where they were later pronounced dead.
Office Lisa Bender told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution the suspects got away but Atlanta police are following up on several leads. No arrests have been made yet.
Update: The victim has been identified as Chelsea Beller of Atlanta. They were one of the restaurant's managers.
Police are accepting tips and information about the crime at 404-577-8477 (phone), text (274637) and at crimestoppersatlanta.org.
Eater Atlanta is working to get more details and will update this story as information becomes available.
Barcelona Wine Bar's Westside location will remain closed Sunday and Monday.
Eric Ferraro, the restaurant's general manager, told Eater Atlanta this afternoon, “All of our employees are really like an extended family—this loss is a horrible tragedy and it has shaken all of us. As this investigation gets underway, we are working closely with the Atlanta police to help them with the investigation. Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with their family and our team.”
Marius Jacob 1905
Why I Was a Burglar

At the turn of the 20th century Marius Jacob led a band of armed criminals originally based in Paris, though their activities eventually spread throughout France. Jacob claimed to have been involved in 106 robberies, and in 1903 their band killed a police officer in the course of a gun battle in Abbeville. They were captured 18 months later and put on trial on 1905. They were found guilty and sentenced to forced labor for life. The following originally appeared in the “Balai Social” in April 1905.
Messieurs:
You now know who I am: a rebel living off the products of their burglaries. In addition I burned down several hotels and defended my freedom against the aggressions of the agents of power.
I laid bare to you my entire existence of combat: I submit it as a problem for your intelligence.
Not recognizing anyone's right to judge me, I don't ask for either pardon or indulgence. I don't go begging to those I hate and hold in contempt. You are the stronger. Dispose of me as you wish; send me to a penal colony or the scaffold. I don't care! But before going our separate ways let me tell you one last thing.
Since you primarily condemn me for being a thief it's useful to define what theft is.
In my opinion theft is a need that is felt by all men to take in order to satisfy their appetites. This need manifests itself in everything: from the stars that are born and die like beings, to the insect in space, so small, so infinite that our eyes can barely distinguish it. Life is nothing but theft and massacre. Plants and beasts devour each other in order to survive.
One is born only to serve as feed for the other. Despite the degree of civilization or, to phrase it better, perfectibility to which they have arrived, man is also subject to this law, and can only escape it under pain of death. They kill both plants and beasts to feed himself: they are insatiable.
Aside from objects of alimentation that assure them life, man also nourishes themselves on air, water, and light. But have we ever seen two men kill each other for the sharing of these aliments? Not that I know of. Nevertheless these are the most precious of items, without which a man cannot live.
We can remain several days without absorbing the substances for which we make ourselves slaves. Can we do the same when it comes to air? Not even for a quarter of an hour. Water accounts for three quarters of our organism and is indispensable in maintaining the elasticity of our tissues. Without heat, without the sun, life would be completely impossible.
And so every man takes, steals their aliments. Do we accuse them of committing a crime? Of course not! Why then de we differentiate these from the rest? Because the rest demand the expending of effort, a certain amount of labor. But labor is the very essence of society; that is, the association of all individuals to conquer with little effort much well-being. Is this truly the image of what exists? Are your institutions based on such a mode of organization? The truth demonstrates the contrary.
The more a man works the less they earn. The less they produce the more they benefit. Merit is not taken into consideration. Only the bold take hold of power and hasten to legalize their rapine.
From top to bottom of the social scale everything is but dastardy on one side and idiocy on the other. How can you expect that penetrated with these truths I could have respected such a state of things?
A liquor seller and the boss of a brothel enrich themselves, while a man of genius dies of poverty in a hospital bed. The baker who bakes bread doesn't get any; the shoemaker who makes thousands of shoes shows their toes; the weaver who makes stocks of clothing doesn't have any to cover themselves with; the bricklayer who builds castles and palaces wants for air in a filthy hovel. Those who produce everything have nothing, and those who produce nothing have everything.
Such a state of affairs can only produce antagonism between the laboring class and the owning, i.e., do-nothing, class. The fight breaks out and hatred delivers its blows.
You call a man a thief and bandit; you apply the rigor of the law against them without asking yourself if they could be something else. Have we ever seen a rentier become a burglar? I admit that I've never known of this. But I, who am neither rentier nor landlord, I who am only man who owns just their arms and their brains to ensure their preservation, had to conduct myself differently. Society only granted me three means of existence: work, begging, or theft. Work, far from being hateful, pleases me: man cannot do without working. Their muscles and brain possess a sum of energy that must be spent. What I hated was sweating blood and tears for a pittance of a salary; it was creating wealth that wouldn't be allowed me.
In a word, I found it hateful to surrender to the prostitution of work. Begging is degradation, the negation of all dignity. Every man has a right to life's banquet.
The right to live isn't begged for, it's taken.
Theft is the restitution, the regaining of possession. Instead of being cloistered in a factory, like in a penal colony; instead of begging for what I had a right to, I preferred to rebel and fight my enemy face to face by making war on the rich, by attacking their goods.
Of course I understand that you would have preferred that I submit to your laws; that as a docile and worn out worker I would have created wealth in exchange for a miserable salary, and when my body would have been worn out and my brain softened I would have died on a street corner. Then you wouldn't have called me a “cynical bandit,” but an “honest worker.” Using flattery, you would even have given me the medal of labor. Priests promise paradise to their dupes. You are less abstract: you offer them a piece of paper.
I thank you for so much goodness, so much gratitude, messieurs. I'd prefer to be a cynic conscious of my rights instead of an automaton, a caryatid.
As soon as I took possession of my consciousness I gave myself over to theft without any scruples. I have no part in your so-called morality that advocates the respect of property as a virtue when in reality there are no worse thieves than landlords.
Consider yourselves lucky, messieurs, that this prejudice has taken root in the people, for these serves as your best gendarme. Knowing the powerlessness of the law, of force, to phrase it better, you have made them the most solid of your protectors. But beware: everything only lasts a certain time. Everything that is constructed, built by ruse and force, can be demolished by ruse and force.
The people are evolving every day. Can't you see that having learned these truths, conscious of their rights, that all the starving, all the wretched, in a word: all your victims, are arming themselves with jimmies and assaulting your homes to take back the wealth they created and that you stole from them
Do you think they'll be any more unhappy? I think the contrary. If they were to think carefully about this they would prefer to run all possible risks rather than fatten you while groaning in misery.
“Prison...penal colonies...the scaffold,” it will be said. But what are these prospects in comparison with the life of a beast made up of all possible sufferings.
The miner who fights for their bread in the earth's entrails, never seeing the sun shine, can perish from one minute to the next, victim of an explosion; the roofer who wanders across the roofs can fall and be smashed to pieces; the sailor knows the day of their departure but doesn't know if he'll return to port. A good number of other workers contract fatal maladies in the exercise of their métier, wear themselves out, poison themselves, kill themselves to create for you. Even gendarmes and police officers – your valets – who, for the bone you give them to nibble on, sometimes meet death in the fight they undertake against your enemies.
Obstinate in your narrow egoism, do you not remain skeptical in regard to this vision? The people are frightened, you seem to be saying. We govern them through fear and repression. If they cry out we'll throw them in prison; if they stumble we'll deport them to the penal colony; if they act we'll guillotine him! All of this is poorly calculated, messieurs, believe you me. The sentences you inflict are not a remedy against acts of revolt. Repression, far from being a remedy, or even a palliative, is only an aggravation of the evil.
Collective measures only plant hatred and vengeance. It's a fatal cycle. In any case, since you have been cutting off heads, since you have been populating the prisons and the penal colonies, have you prevented hatred from manifesting itself? Say something! Answer! The facts demonstrate your impotence.
For my part I knew full well that my conduct could have no other issue than the penal colony or the scaffold. You must see that this did not prevent me from acting. If I gave myself over to theft it was not a question of gain, of lucre, but a question of principle, of right. I preferred to preserve my liberty, my independence, my dignity as a man rather than to make myself the artisan of someone else's fortune. To put it crudely, with no euphemisms: I preferred to rob rather than be robbed!
Of course I, too, condemn the act through which a man violently and through ruse takes possession of the fruits of someone else's labor. But it's precisely because of this that I made war on the rich, thieves of the goods of the poor. I too want to live in a society from which theft is banished. I only approved of and used theft as the means of revolt most appropriate for combating the most unjust of all thefts: individual property.
In order to destroy an effect you must first destroy the cause. If there is theft it is only because there is abundance on one hand and famine on the other; because everything only belongs to some. The struggle will only disappear when men will put their joys and suffering in common, their labors and their riches, when all will belong to everyone.
Revolutionary anarchist, I made my revolution. Vive l'anarchie!
For Germinal, to you, to the cause.

NEW YORK — Though the NYPD banned 2015's hottest gadget "hoverboards" from New York City streets, one city councilman said they would push to legalize them, but with limitations.
NYPD's 26th Precinct tweeted out earlier this week that hoverboards are illegal, according to NYC Admin Code 19-176.2. Though the code's definition of a "motorized scooter" doesn't fit a hoverboard description, it's still banned from city streets.
To clarify, the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law “requires all motor vehicles to be registered with the NYS DMV,” if they cannot be registered “they are not permitted.”
However, there is a push to legalize them to some degree.
The Bronx City Councilman Andy King told PIX11 they would draft new legislation that if passed, would allow New Yorkers to ride hoverboards in certain places.
"The uses of the hoverboards would be on sidewalks, in playgrounds or parks," King said.
"Primarily for safety reasons because we don't want [person on] a hoverboard that can travel at a maximum of six miles an hour think they can ride on the streets of Manhattan, or the streets of Queens, Brooklyn, or any streets of New York City, and start competing with trucks or buses," King told PIX11.
Hoverboards became a popular gadget among millennials, dancers and celebrities this year. The futuristic gadgets also made it onto Time's "Best Inventions of 2015" list. A hoverboard can cost between $400 to more than $1,000.
If New Yorkers are caught using a hoverboard in the city, they can get receive a $200 fine.
I've been fortunate to have some measure of success in my life, primarily through this very blog over the last eight years, and in creating Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange over the last four years. With the birth of our twin girls, I've had a few months to pause and reflect on those experiences. What did I do right? What did I do wrong? How would I do things differently next time? What advice should I give other people based on my own life experiences?
The short answer is that I wouldn't.
There are too many paths forward in life; I barely feel qualified to make decisions about what to do in my own life, much less recommend strategies for others in theirs. On some level I feel like Jared Fogle, who lost 245 pounds eating nothing but Subway subs. Maybe that worked for him, but how does that make it a valid diet strategy for the rest of the world? In other words, what I did worked for me, but I'm crazy.
That's also never stopped anyone else from handing out terrible life advice hand over fist before. So I figure why not. Who wants to live forever?
Under pressure to make some sense of what I've been doing with my life for the last eight years, I put together a small presentation which I delivered yesterday at this year's Atlassian summit.
How to Stop Sucking and Be Awesome Instead If you're reading this abstract, you're not awesome enough. Attend this session to unlock the secrets of Jeff Atwood, world famous blogger and industry leading co-founder of Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange. Learn how you too can determine clear goals for your future and turn your dreams into reality through positive-minded conceptualization techniques.* Within six to eight weeks, you'll realize the positive effects of Jeff Atwood's wildly popular Coding Horror blog in your own life, transporting you to an exciting new world of wealth, happiness and political power. * May or may not also include working hard on things that matter for the rest of your life.
I hope you can forgive me for the title, and I guess the rest of the abstract, and probably the entirety of the presentation too, but I find it's easier to be serious when I'm not being entirely serious. At any rate, it's complicated.
Here's what I've seen work:
Embrace the Suck Do It in Public Pick Stuff That Matters
The video explains. When put on the spot, under duress, I have selectively doled out this advice to a few people over the years – and miraculously, I've seen them succeed using these rules, too.
(I put a lot of additional explanatory detail in the slide notes that you'll only see if you download the full presentation.)
"it's better to be safe than sorry" is such crap. You know what's better than being safe? Being AWESOME. — Jeff Atwood (@codinghorror) January 11, 2009
Mostly, I think it's the fear that gets us, in all its forms. Fear of not achieving. Fear of not keeping up. Fear of looking dumb. Fear of being inadequate. Fear of being exposed. Fear of failure. The only thing preventing us from being awesome is our own fear of sucking.
So that's why I say we embrace it. Who wants to live forever?
As I have been editing some of the pictures from my latest trip to Panama, I thought of sharing only a few snaps with you guys and my favorite soup recipe from there. This leek soup with marinated shrimps is so gooood as it's got such a fragrant and special flavor and it requires only a few ingredients.
As funny as it might sound, I also learned this soup from my boyfriend's mom, even though I meet them only twice. Here is the first one – Soup a la Panama – where you can find the recipe and a few details about how we first met.
As I have been editing some of the pictures from my latest trip to Panama, I thought of sharing only a few snaps with you guys. It such a beautiful and magical place. I love it!!!
Before going on with the recipe, I would like to remind you of the HEALTH BENEFITS of leek.
Firstly, I want to mention that unfortunately leeks have received less research attention than their fellow allium vegetables (especially garlic and onions), and for this reason, there is less documentation about their health benefits.
However, leeks contain many flavonoid anti-oxidants (such as carotenes, xantin and lutein), minerals and vitamins that have proven health benefits. In addition, leeks are one of the good source of vitamin A and C, which helps the human body develop resistance against infectious agents. Including leek in your weekly diet during pregnancy might help prevent neural tube defects in newborns.
Cooking leek is easier than you might think. Fist off, look for firm leeks with dark green leaves and a white (not yellowed) neck.
My recipe for today is really easy to do. And, as a bonus, you only need leek, onions, shrimps and fresh lemons, in order to get the best leek soup ever. I am not promising you not the most appealing picture, but a wonderful taste and such a healthy bite.
Print Leek Soup with marinated Shrimps Author: Cook it fit Prep time: 5 mins Cook time: 40 mins Total time: 45 mins Serves: 4 Ingredients 3 leeks (white and light green parts only), halved lengthwise
300 g tiger shrimps
2 big onions, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 fresh lemon
sea salt and pepper to taste Instructions First off, cut off the dark green top and the roots of the fresh leeks and remove the outer leaves. In a medium saucepan add olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the onions, leeks, cayenne pepper and 2 cups of still water stirring occasionally, until they soften and become lightly golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, marinate the shrimps on a plate with the chopped onions and fresh lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Lastly, add the shrimps to the saucepan and let them cook for another 15 minutes and ready to be served. Notes Get creative, use the ingredients you have on hand and stay healthy!

Solidarity is how-to survive
I wrote this analysis of global gentrification patterns and squatting land worldwide in 2009 and found it very relevant today. My mind is set on squatting the foreclosures in 2012, defending against evictions, defending foreclosed-on homes, and opening up new spaces for solidarities to find themselves. This is necessary now. I'm done sitting back and watching spaces remain empty, and get emptier, as more and more of us wander streets at night without a place to sit down or sleep. We keep hitting up against the same wall. I envision some rhizomatic occupying of the empty space everywhere in 2012 as part of a broader anti-capitalist and anti-authoritarian struggle. New spaces can be occupied as launching pads, places that spark new nodes of creation. There, our solidarities are the un-evictable fortresses — it's not so much about the space itself. Taking space is a continuation of solidarity. We need space is for survival, and solidarity is how to survive. Let's get to the other side. Solidarity has many new meanings.

From Utopia Or Bust. June 26, 2009.
Bank like Oliver Twist
This video is the simplified, dinner-table outreach version of the World Bank argument put forth by Hernando de Soto, the Peruvian economist famous for saying that capitalism is failing in Third World countries because of complicated legal systems. De Soto and the World Bank advocate widespread privatization of extra-legal and squatter neighborhoods in order to bring them all under a single power, one common notion: the formal property-ownership system.
In their book The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else, de Soto is apologetic about the “existing game”. But they write,
The Marxist tool kit is better geared to explain class conflict than capitalist thinking, which has no comparable analysis or even a serious strategy for reaching the poor in the extralegal sector.
That's interesting, because later in the book they say,
Marx would probably be shocked to find how in developing countries much of the teeming mass does not consist of oppressed legal proletarians but of oppressed extralegal small entrepreneurs with a sizable amount of assets.
Dickens would probably be shocked, too. (De Soto makes a reference to Oliver Twist in the video.) Oliver Twist, scrummaging around in Fagin's underground den of thieves, is a representation of the poorest of the poor – the social and economic “underclass” of the class system – who are mistreated by people even slightly higher then them on the social scale. Anyone anywhere may have a “sturdy spirit” – like an Oliver Twist – under a any kind of circumstances. But that appeal to the entrepreneurial spirit of the poor and their assets is also just a really bad intellectual anachronism: the poor have always had “sizable amount of assets” in the eyes of the colonizers and the realtors.
When de Soto talks about the benefits of capitalism that the poor can achieve through formal titles, they are referring to land reform in a vacuum, in complete isolation. (Mystery of Capital is not different in that sense from the film.) Without any analysis of the specific rights — usufruct, mineral, transfer, autonomy, development, etc. — that would be conferred by the formal title, no one can be sure if land-titling (an expensive process itself) would benefit the poor at all. But even more to the point, legal property rights are simply a recipe for legal appropriation, a way to pick more from the pockets of the poor through legal land reform.
Third World governments do not like having huge informal settlements so close to the places where exploitation originates: the factories, the banks, the inner-urban core. For years governments have burned down these villages, killed the inhabitants, or just bulldozed them. Many countries signed agreements with the UN against “forced evictions,” but many countries are still eager to eradicate this population. Kenya is infamous for repeatedly violating this agreement in the district of Kibera, the largest slum in Africa. Aside from forced eviction, what can governments do? This is why the World Bank/ De Soto argument is increasing in popularity.
What is the aim of this policy? It would be great if formalizing property rights for the poorest would improve peoples' lives on a practical level, but improving lives of the inner-city poor this is not the aim of the policy. The aim of the policy is to pacify this group so they do not resort to terrorism or revolutionary ideology. This is what de Soto's book The Other Path is all about. It details how including poor people in public decisions can reduce terrorism.
Reviewers were quick to point out that de Soto committed a fallacy almost every right-wing academic after 9/11 committed, namely, equivocating poverty with terrorism. More importantly, their ideas come from a position of privilege, where the only solutions to poverty he's interested in are ones that reduce terrorism, so the two-thirds of the world don't “bring down the existing game”. The rhetoric of raising standards of living is merely an afterthought.
The central locations of many informal settlements slated for formalization make them irresistible targets for “urban renewal” and gentrification by large-scale developers who have “the political influence and financial power to solve the very confusing ownership problems,” explains Ozlem Dundar, a Turkish scholar who studied the gecekondu (squatted slum) neighborhoods around Istanbul. Once a neighborhood's assets are the objects of interest for wealthy landowners, the property and capital acquisitions soon follow. Land-titling serves a function in Third World developing countries – to prevent class war, or at least to legitimate it. But to drive the point further, it the preferred way for legally appropriating what assets the poor do have. Meanwhile the guarantor of land rights (states) are no longer liable for conditions in the slums; the state is no longer liable.
The Philippines, a pilot country for the World Bank's new global strategy for urban development, is a case in point. The Bank identified 253 poor “areas for priority development,” beginning with a vast section of squatter housing along the shores of Manila. Investments “trickled straight up to the land developers and the construction industry,” wrote Erhard Berner in a 2000 paper called Poverty Alleviation and the Eviction of the Poorest in the Journal of Urban and Regional Research. A poor village in Pasig, also, was widely heralded as a model project for poor families, with Pope Paul VI as an official sponsor of the operation. But within five years of the World Bank involved in Pasig, writes Berner,
All the original dwellers had left because their lots had been sold to wealthy families.
The program's failure led the World Bank to change its focus to sites-and-services provisions in newer settlement areas outside metro Manila. “These remote locations discouraged gentrification,” writes Mike Davis in Planet of Slums. However, the gentrification had essentially already taken place.
Titling in slums creates dramatic disparities, and often a lot of the money goes to ‘slumlords'. Sociologist Susan Eckstein wrote that 25 to 50 percent of the original squatters, from the 1960s and 70s, built small vecindades which they in turn rented to poorer newcomers. This later evolved into a “two-tiered housing market” that reflected a “downward socioeconomic leveling of the population”: although some older residents had thrived as ‘landlords', the new renters had far less hope of socioeconomic mobility than earlier generations. By the turn of the century the number of poor had increased, but with the two-tiered housing market in place the colonia as a whole could no longer be called the “slum of hope”.
The Lopez Portillo administration in Mexico City (1976 – 1982) encouraged squatter settlements to sell their property at market rates, which resulted in the middle-class gentrification of formerly poor colonias in prime, inner-city locations. This time-period in Mexico City's history is particularly interesting because the economic structure changed so rapidly in just a few years. With land titling, these changes take place so fast it is difficult to unravel their complexities years later. And by then, the price of a lawyer competent enough to make the case for small land use conflicts, and who is well-versed in adverse possession law, would be out of reach for the poorest.
De Soto acknowledges the existence of informal laws, an “extra-legal” formulation, that operate in the urban slums and the squats. Capitalism, they say, will not work in these areas unless they all obey the same rules and regulations as international capitalist systems. If the extra-legal sector is not the brave new – entrepreneurial-spirited – world envisioned by de Soto, it is certainly still a living museum of human exploitation. What miseries have been narrated by Dickens, Gorky or Zola that do not exist somewhere in the Third World today? Land-titling, the peripheral nation's equivalent of globalized gentrification, is in my opinion the proverbial wolf in sheep's clothing.
Many contemporary theorists are reluctant to recognise the globalisation of capitalist production and its world market as a fundamentally new situation and a significant historical shift. The theorists associated with the world-systems perspective, for example, argue that from its inception, capitalism has always functioned as a world economy, and therefore those who clamor about the novelty of its globalisation today have only misunderstood its history. Certainly, it is important to emphasise both capitalism's continuous foundational relationship to (or at least a tendency toward) the world market and capitalism's expanding cycles of development. But, without underestimating these real and important lines of continuity, we think it is important to note that what used to be conflict or competition among several imperialist powers has in many important respects been replaced by the idea of a single power that overdetermines them all, structures them in a unitary way, and treats them under one common notion of right that is decidedly postcolonial and postimperialist. – Toni Negri, Empire

UPDATE: August 26, 2015, 4:30 p.m. ET: At a news conference this afternoon at the National Zoo, officials including veterinarian Donald Neiffer and panda curator Brandie Smith described the loss of the smaller panda cub as devastating, but said that the opportunity to learn and share knowledge about the experience was "exponential."
As of yesterday at 2 p.m., the smaller cub had been with its mother Mei Xiang, after being successfully rotated out for the larger cub, which was then placed in the care of the panda team.
Previous reports that Mei Xiang preferred one cub over the other were inaccurate. Rather, the mother giant panda was handling each cub well and being a good mother to both cubs, Neiffer said. But Mei Xiang had trouble during the swapback exercise releasing one cub for the other. They were concerned, they said, about giving up the baby.
After the birth of their second cub, the panda team observed that they were having trouble managing the twins. The swapping protocol was developed to help the mother panda handle the two cubs, because it is believed that the animals are largely able to care for just one cub at a time.
Last night, the smaller cub was with its mother, and throughout the night the team watching the mother and cub reported that the baby was nursing and showing no signs of distress. "Mei Xiang was doing everything right," said Neiffer.
However, this morning, after the larger cub was given to Mei Xiang for its turn, zoo officials discovered that the smaller cub had not gained weight, appeared weaker and may have developed a respiratory issue. Despite heroic efforts by the "best medical team" assembled, according to Smith, the cub's condition worsened throughout the afternoon. At the time of death, the Zoo reports, the animal weighed just 2.8 ounces.
"Do we have a feel for why this cub died?" asked Neiffer, who said that a full necropsy and pathology study will be done and analyzed by the team at the National Zoo and its Chinese partners. This information will be shared with other panda keepers and other zoos, along with the experiences of the staff employed to nurture and hand-raise the two twin cubs—including the methods for bottle feeding and for swapping the panda cubs. Neiffer said the entire experience will "increase our knowledge base."
"It is an awesome responsibility to help the mother care for their cubs," said Smith, who noted that the Zoo still has one healthy cub and that Mei Xiang is "the same incredible mother that they were for Bao Bao and Tai Shan," the cubs they delivered in 2013 and 2005.
###
The National Zoo reports that one of its newborn panda cubs has died. The smaller cub, which was born on August 23 at 10:07 p.m. ET and died today at 2 p.m. ET weighed just 86 grams at birth, was under the care of veterinarians and keepers. Mei Xiang had refused the staff's attempts to get them to swap out one panda cub for the other. Instead, the 17-year-old female panda had held fast to the larger cub, leaving Zoo staff no choice but to try to rear the animal—keeping it warm inside an incubator, feeding it formula, administering additional fluids and trying to keep it safe from infection with antibiotics.
Zoo officials report that the larger cub is "strong, robust, behaving normally" and is with its mother Mei Xiang.
The Zoo says that it will be holding a press conference at 4 p.m. ET. Watch this space for updates.

WASHINGTON — Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-08, is getting a Navy combat ship named after them — the first living woman since Martha Washington to be the namesake of a warship.
She'll be joined by some other trailblazing women at the commissioning of the USS Gabrielle Giffords on Saturday in Galveston, Texas: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Second Lady Jill Biden will attend the ceremony.
Giffords was shot during a constituent event in Tucson, Ariz. in 2011. They survived the assassination attempt, but it left them disabled and they resigned from their seat in Congress. On the same day they announced their retirement then-Navy secretary Ray Mabus told them the Navy planned to name a warship in their honor.
The district that Giffords represented has a large military presence and they served on the House Armed Services Committee when they were in Congress. That seat is now held by GOP Rep. Martha McSally, who was the first female fighter pilot to fly in combat.

NEW DELHI: In a twist to the mystery behind the sudden transfer of Justice
from
days before they were to take over as the acting chief justice, it turns out that the
collegium had decided to transfer Patel to Bombay HC but suddenly changed its mind and shifted them to Allahabad HC instead.
The collegium headed by CJI Dipak Mishra had, at a meeting early last week, decided to transfer Justice Patel from Karnataka HC. The meeting saw some members of the collegium, which also comprises Justices J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B Lokur and Kurian Joseph, question the CJI on the timing of the transfer.
According to sources, the posers were tough but failed to lead the CJI to spell out the specific reason for Patel's transfer.
The matter was to turn curiouser still. Last Friday, the collegium met again and this time decided to move Patel to Allahabad HC, which led them to resign.
The resignation set off speculation about the abrupt change of mind regarding the judge who had shot to the limelight when they ordered a CBI probe into the “encounter” of Ishrat Jehan, along with alleged LeT terrorists, in Gujarat during Narendra Modi's chief ministership.
The Friday meeting also decided to transfer four other HC judges back to their parent HC, including Justice Rajiv Shakdher of Madras HC to Delhi HC and Justice D Seshadri Naidu from Kerala HC to Hyderabad HC.
The process of transfer of judges is supposed to factor in views of the chief justices of the two HCs involved. In practice, however, this turns into a ritualistic formality where the CJI writes identical letters to the chief justices of the two HCs proposing transfer of a judge from one HC to the other “in the interest of better administration of justice”.
Sources could not explain how the CJI obtained the views of the CJs of the HCs of Bombay, Karnataka and Allahabad within a short span.
The actual reason for a judge's transfer from one HC to another is seldom spelt out, making it impossible for the CJs to give their opinion. This reduces transfers to a “pickand-choose affair”, sources said, highlighting the pitch Justice Chelameswar had made for making it mandatory for the collegium to record its reasons for selecting a person for appointment as a judge of the
or HCs, or transferring ajudge from one HC to another.
A year ago, Chelameswar had opted out of collegium meetings and started recording their views on files containing the collegium's decision to select a person for appointment as judge and transfer of HC judges. They had told TOI a year ago that a transfer wasn't the solution for disciplining a “bad” judge. “If they are bad in one HC, they will be bad in the other HC too. There are several ways to discipline a judge without transferring him,” they had said.
In the recent judgment convicting Justice C S Karnan for contempt, Justice Chelameswar had brought into focus two issues —the need to revisit the process of selection and appointment of judges to constitutional courts, and the need to set up an appropriate legal regime to deal with situations where the conduct of a judge required corrective measures —other than impeachment.
Despite the recent outcry over the Science Museum's “What Sex Is My Brain?” exhibit, the BBC continues to relentlessly promote brain sex theory by another name, the latest example being “I'm a non-binary 10-year-old” on Radio 4 last week.
This show seriously presented the idea that a ‘girl' brain is recognisable by ownership of a Barbie doll and a ‘bright pink bedroom' and a ‘boy' brain by the preference for ‘pirates, Iron Man, Wolverine and Peter Pan.' Not only that, but that it is from observation of these preferences that we can divine whether a child is actually, in reality, a boy or a girl. A child who has a range of interests, including some from the gender ‘pink' box and some from the gender ‘blue' box, must therefore, we are told, be ‘non-binary' which means that they are (actually, in reality) neither a boy nor a girl.
There are some people who really do believe this and the BBC here presents their confused conflation of gender and sex and their belief in regressive outdated stereotypes as truth, without question or any critical examination. Here is the mother:
“We took it very seriously. Leo wanted to be “out.” Leo is definitely not a girl, Leo is more boy than girl but he's not like a lot of transgender people, a male mind who happened to be born in a female body, he's a non-binary mind who happened to be born in a female body.”
The programme presents this reaction from a parent as not only normal, but the right way to respond to a 10 year-old girl who says “I want to be a boy”:
ask the girl what boy's name they would like
ask them whether they would be a gay man or a straight man
ask the child every morning “are you a girl or a boy today?”
go and do some online research from ‘hundreds” of transgender sites
share this ‘research' with the daughter until they believe that they are literally neither a girl nor a boy
introduce the idea of puberty blockers and hormones
Since when did children's toy choices literally change a child into the opposite sex, whose body then needs to be medically altered to reflect that? And when did it become seen as good parenting to teach a child an ideology which will lead to that medicalisation, to the extent that we celebrate those parents on national radio?
The BBC is promoting the idea that the categories ‘boy' and ‘girl' are actually defined by stereotypes of behaviour and interests and not by male and female biology, and that those children who don't fit the stereotypes need to be be set on a path towards sterilisation and lifelong medication.
This particular 10 year-old girl now believes this:
“No, I'm not a boy or a girl. I'm non-binary, so I'm in the middle. There isn't a body of the two genders. I just wish there was some way in the middle. But I don't think there is.”
There is no such thing as a ‘body of the two genders' because gender is a social idea of ‘masculine' and ‘feminine' and, as we all have a mixture of ‘masculine' and ‘feminine' traits, everyone is non-binary. What this child really means is a body of two sexes, which does exist but only if you have a rare genetic disorder which makes you biologically intersex. Nobody has taught this young girl the difference between gender and sex, that they are female and that they can have any preferences they want; that their interests do not make them male. The BBC sees fit to celebrate the resulting confusion of an extremely bright and articulate young girl.
The most upsetting and inevitable conclusion drawn by a girl who is taught that their interests make their body, is that that body will need to be changed.  They are astute in their observation that it is their breasts which will cause the biggest problem later, as they are the most visible indication that they are female. The typical path for girls, of wearing damaging breast-binders followed by a double mastectomy, is laid out for them
Why is the BBC promoting this?
What chance is there that this young girl will ‘change their mind' when they have been so thoroughly indoctrinated into gender identity ideology from all the trusted adults in their life, including the teachers at their school? At what point did schools in the UK become gender faith schools, unable to resist this doctrine and teach children facts? And why are we allowing schools to reinforce a rigid orthodoxy based on gender stereotypes; weren't we supposed to be challenging those?
The answer comes from the mother:
“The school need to understand that they have an obligation and that Leo has rights as a trans plus person.”
‘Gender reassignment' is a protected category which also applies to children, so it cannot be challenged. ‘Sex' is also a protected category, but we are doing nothing to protect biologically female children from this orthodoxy which is not only based on the gender stereotypes which have always disproportionately harmed girls, but creates a whole new way to damage them.
The BBC is complicit in encouraging parents to pathologise the normal behaviour of any child who deviates from prescriptive gender stereotypes, and as a public service broadcaster should not be presenting this damaging set of beliefs about children as fact. To uncritically present a programme about how a young girl is convinced by adults to believe that their body is ‘wrong' and will need medical intervention to correct it is irresponsible beyond belief.
There's another way of responding to a 10 year-old girl who tells you they think they might be a boy. It's to simply say “No. You're female, you're a girl. You can have any interests you like, and don't let anyone ever tell you that liking any of those things makes you a boy.”
You can complain to the BBC here.

Liu Yang and two male astronauts take off from the Gobi desert on mission to help build space station within decade
China's first female astronaut has launched into space as part of a mission to build a fully operational space station within the decade.
A Long March rocket blasted off at 6.37pm from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in the Gobi desert on Saturday, carrying the Shenzhou 9 spacecraft and three astronauts, including female fighter pilot Liu Yang.
Liu, 33, Jing Haipeng and Liu Wang are to dock with a prototype space lab launched last year in a key step toward building a larger, more permanent space station by 2020. They are to work there for about a week.
While two of the astronauts will live and work inside the module to test its life-support systems, the third will remain in the capsule to deal with any unexpected emergencies.
China's space programme chief, Chang Wanquan, a general in the Chinese army and a member of the ruling Communist party's central military commission, declared the launch a success. China is already planning another mission to the space lab later this year. Other future missions could include sending a man – or indeed woman – to the moon.
China hopes to join the US and Russia as the only countries to send independently maintained space stations into orbit. The three are the only countries to have launched manned spacecraft on their own volition.
China has had only limited co-operation with other nations and space programmes. It was excluded from work with the International Space Station, largely due to the objections of the US – seen as one of the key spurs for the launch of its independent space programme 20 years ago – although in more recent years the head of the European Space Agency has mooted China's inclusion in the ISS partnership. Nasa's chief, Charlie Bolden, said in 2011 that "any mission to Mars is likely to be a global effort".
The space programme is a source of huge national pride in China and reflects its rapid economic and technological progress and ambition to rank among the world's leading nations. The selection of a female astronaut also gives the mission a notable first for any country.
In a statement read to Chinese technicians involved in the launch, the Chinese leader, Hu Jintao, said: "I urge you to carry forward the spirit … and make new contributions to advance the development of our country's manned space mission."
China first launched a man into space in a 2003 solo mission. This was followed by a two-man mission in 2005 and a three-man trip in 2008.
U.S. bombs Pacific Ocean island… with dead mice! Rodents filled with poisonous painkillers rain down on Guam in attempt to kill off 2MILLION tree snakes
Two million brown tree snakes have made species of wildlife extinct in Guam
Hawaii officials concerned snakes could travel 3,000 miles and cause havoc
Dead mice laced with painkillers are set to rain down on Guam as scientists attempt to contain two million brown tree snakes which have caused havoc for more than 60 years.
Most of Guam's native bird species are extinct because of the snake, which reached the island's thick jungles as stowaways on U.S. military ships coming from the South Pacific shortly after World War II.
There are fears that without action the species could spread to Hawaii, more than 3,000 miles away and cause a 'snakes on a plane' scenario.
The brown tree snake was brought to Guam on U.S. military ships more than 60 years ago and has wreaked havoc
The snakes can climb power poles and wires, causing blackouts, or slither into homes and bite people, including babies; they use venom on their prey but it is not lethal to humans.
Most of Guam's native birds were defenseless against the nocturnal, tree-based predators, and within a few decades of the reptile's arrival, nearly all of them were wiped out.
The infestation and the toll it has taken on native wildlife have tarnished Guam's image as a tourism haven, though the snakes are rarely seen outside their jungle habitat.
The solution to this headache, fittingly enough, is acetaminophen, the active ingredient in painkillers including Tylenol.
The U.S. government will drop dead mice laced with painkillers in an attempt to control and contain the numbers of brown tree snakes.
Agriculture wildlife specialist Tony Salas holds a brown tree snake at Andersen Air Force Base on the island of Guam
The venom of brown tree snakes is not harmful to humans but they have been known to bite babies in Guam
Daniel Vice, assistant state director of U.S. Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services in Hawaii, Guam, and the Pacific Islands, said: 'We are taking this to a new phase. There really is no other place in the world with a snake problem like Guam.'
Acetaminophen, the same drug used in pain killers like Tylenol, will be used to lace the dead mice as bait
The strategy takes advantage of the snake's two big weaknesses. Unlike most snakes, brown tree snakes are happy to eat prey they didn't kill themselves, and they are highly vulnerable to acetaminophen, which is harmless to humans.
The upcoming mice drop is targeted to hit snakes near Guam's sprawling Andersen Air Force Base, which is surrounded by heavy foliage and if compromised would offer the snakes a potential ticket off the island. Using helicopters, the dead neonatal mice will be dropped by hand, one by one.
U.S. government scientists have been perfecting the mice-drop strategy for more than a decade with support from the Department of Defense and the Department of the Interior.
To keep the mice bait from dropping all the way to the ground, where it could be eaten by other animals or attract insects as they rot, researchers have developed a flotation device with streamers designed to catch in the branches of the forest foliage, where the snakes live and feed.
Experts say the impact on other species will be minimal, particularly since the snakes have themselves wiped out the birds that might have been most at risk.
'One concern was that crows may eat mice with the toxicant,' said William Pitt, of the U.S. National Wildlife Research Center's Hawaii Field Station.
'However, there are no longer wild crows on Guam. We will continue to refine methods to increase efficiency and limit any potential non-target hazards.'
Just as the snakes found their way to Guam, they could stow away on a ship, or more likely the cargo hold of an airplane, and begin breeding on other islands around the Pacific or even the U.S. West Coast.
It is hoped the mouse bomb will help to contain the species to limit the damage in Guam and stop spread to Hawaii
The risk of the snakes spreading has officials in Hawaii on edge. The islands of Hawaii, like Guam, lack the predators that could keep a brown tree snake population in check.
INVASIVE: BROWN TREE SNAKES
Brown tree snakes are known as an invasive species because of the destruction they cause in their habitat. They are native to Australia and Papua New Guinea and usually measure around 6ft, but can grow to be 10ft long.
Their appearance varies from a lightly patterned brown to yellowish green or beige with red saddle-shaped blotches
They have two fangs at the rear of their mouth containing neutrotoxic and cytotoxic venom, which is not dangerous to humans. Females produce up to 12 eggs at a time which are just over one inch long.
Native Hawaiian birds 'literally don't know what to do when they see a snake coming,' said Christy Martin, a spokesperson for the Coordinating Group on Alien Pest Species, a partnership of Hawaii government agencies and private organizations.
A 2010 study conducted by the National Wildlife Research Center found brown tree snakes would cause between $593 million and $2.14 billion in economic damage each year if they became established in Hawaii like they are on Guam.
Power outages would cause the most damage, followed by a projected decline in tourism. The cost of treating snake bites would account for a small share.
'Once we get snakes here, we're never going to be able to fix the situation,' Martin said.
So far, Guam's containment seems to be working. Only a few brown tree snakes have ever been found in Hawaii, and none over the past 17 years.

Donald Trump challenged Hillary Clinton to spend their own money on their presidential campaign Sunday, saying it would give them some independence from their donors.
Mrs. Clinton, in the second presidential debate, had blasted the 2010 Citizens United court decision that opened the door to groups spending unlimited money to get a message out in elections, and said they would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn that ruling.
Mr. Trump countered that Mrs. Clinton is more beholden to those big-money interests than they are, saying he's going to spend upwards of $100 million of their own money on their campaign. They challenged them to pony up as much as $30 million of the $250 million they and their husband have earned since they left the White House in 2001.
“Why aren't you putting some money in?” they demanded.
Mrs. Clinton did not respond to the challenge.
Mrs. Clinton is easily out-raising Mr. Trump in the campaign, and Mr. Trump tried to downplay that disadvantage, saying Sunday that most of the money he's raising is going to the GOP, and he's funding their own operation.

Bitcoin has been making a lot of news lately. The cryptocurrency shot up in value by over 200% in 2017, making many people fear that the market is in a bubble. Last week, China decided to close its bitcoin exchanges, which caused investors around the world to panic about the currency's long-term viability. But HowMuch.net asks, how many people own bitcoin, and how is the currency distributed around the world? Check out our new visualization.
Source: HowMuch.net
Our graph represents the entire bitcoin market, which has a value of around $60 billion. For comparison, that's bigger than several well-known companies, like Fed-Ex and General Motors. We then divided the value of the bitcoin market by address. As you can see, over 95% of all bitcoins in circulation are owned by about 4% of the market. In fact, 1% of the addresses control half the entire market.
There are a couple limitations in our data. Most importantly, each address can represent more than one individual person. An obvious example would be a bitcoin exchange or wallet, which hold the currency for a lot of different people. Another limitation has to do with anonymity. If you want to remain completely anonymous, you can use something called CoinJoin, a process that allows users to group similar transactions together. This makes it seem like two people are using the same address, when in reality they are not.
So it's a complex situation. but let's try to break bitcoin down as simple as possible. Bitcoin is just a type of money, like dollars and euros. The main difference is that there isn't a sovereign government backing the currency, and it instead lives online. This is possible thanks to something called the blockchain. Banks and companies must keep detailed records of where they send money, marking it possible to detect fraud and criminal activity. The blockchain works differently because it breaks each transaction into tiny components, routes the pieces through a computer network, and directs them to a recipient who can then re-assemble the code together. If you don't have the right key, you can't own a bitcoin. And if you aren't at the right digital address (think your home network's IP address), then you can't receive bitcoin.
The technology is hard to understand, and it presents challenges for companies and people who want to use it. That's why folks typically turn to a vendor like Coinbase to handle their transactions. You know how you carry physical money in your personal wallet? Think of Coinbase as a digital wallet. You use it to buy stuff and pay for services. But be careful—people can steal your digital wallet, and the thieves can be untraceable. And that's the issue. There's only a very limited number of bitcoin wallet providers out there. It's not like you can just go to your local bank and buy some bitcoin.
The big takeaway from all this is that if you are considering purchasing some bitcoin, you have very limited options. There are only a few key players in the game where you can park your investment. And if you do make that purchase, understand that it is highly speculative and unregulated, so prepare for a bumpy ride.
Welcome to the Spirit of Cannabis Tour! After an extremely successful 4 retreats, 3 in California and 1 in Canada we are now creating the 5th Cannabliss Retreat! To celebrate we are hosting it in the country that is the HEART of cannabis culture and spirit, at the fabulous 4-star resort Coral Cove Jamaica!!
The retreat will be held on June 16 – 23rd, over the Summer Solstice! It will be a time to plant our seeds of intention, to cultivate our deepest connections with ourselves, the plant and our community!
As we venture into Jamaica, we wanted to embody the historical richness of this culture and land and bring this experience to our community. The emergence of Rastafarian culture cemented the culture of cannabis in Jamaica. Rastafarians regularly use cannabis spiritually during ceremonies as a meditation aid. During “reasoning” sessions Rastas gather to smoke the “holy herb” and discuss moral quandaries while passing the ganja clockwise around the circle.
Rastafarians consider cannabis a part of the Tree of Life mentioned in the Bible and believe that “The herb is the key to new understanding of the self, the universe, and The Creator. It is the vehicle to cosmic consciousness.”
Join us on June 16 – 23 for this sacred experience! We will feast, we will commune, we will learn, we will adventure, we will sing and dance, we will celebrate all that cannabis has gifted us in life! And as Bob Marley so eloquently put it; “When you smoke the herb, it reveals you to yourself”
In Jamaica, guests will also have the opportunity to immerse themselves in Jamaican adventures and culture including snorkeling and swimming in private protected reefs, touring a local cannabis farm and Bob Marley's former home, hiking nearby hills, sea cave exploration, and enjoying delicious Jamaican cuisine, Rastafarian education, cannabis ceremonies, local shopping, spa services
This is a community by the people for the people and we are being lead by this sacred plant!!
Coral Cove is not on the tourist trail and is unlike any resort you've ever visited. This is a place for adventurous vacationers wanting to experience the rich Jamaican culture; off the beaten path, far away from the hordes of hotel row. The cool breezes, pampered personal service, comfortable accommodations and extraordinary Jamaican cuisine make it the perfect place for a Cannabliss Retreat!

ALEXANDRIA, Va. - President Obama is facing a fight from Republicans in Congress over their battle plan to combat climate change with new carbon pollution standards and investments in clean energy. He's dispatched their top energy adviser to Capitol Hill this eek to rally support. At the same time, he's getting the endorsement of another powerful group - retired U.S. admirals and generals.
"We've been calling for determined American leadership in the area of climate change and energy security and pursuit of renewables because of their security benefit," said Vice Admiral Lee Gunn, one of 12 retired military leaders who are tackling national security issues as part of the Center for Naval Analyses' Alexandria-based Military Advisory Board.
Gunn said the hope is that other world leaders will follow.
"I can tell you as someone who deals frequently with allied governments, there is a thirst around the world for American leadership," Gunn said.
The CNA board calls climate change a likely "threat multiplier" for increasing instability in some of the most volatile regions of the world, and says Obama's plan takes important steps to address it.

I have my own personal relationship with Phillip Hughes. It's probably different from yours.
I never met them in person, yet know them to be humble.
I never interviewed them on the phone, yet know how hard they worked on their game.
I am not related to him, yet they are my little brother. They will keep fighting and battling to get what they want.
Phillip was not just a batsman. They were a run maker. A rare talent.
Batsmen follow the book. Technically sound. Look graceful.
Phillip was none of those.
They had their own way. The back foot stepping towards leg stump. The flash outside off.
Four.
Runs.
Their stats are on the public record. The typical cricket fan will use these to judge him. But they tell a partial story. A half finished book. One you stop reading just before you get to the really good chapters.
There should be stats for fighting spirit, courage, work ethic and respect.
These would show Phillip as one of the greats.
I am off to Brisbane on Thursday to watch the first ball of the 1st Test of the summer. I am entertaining clients.
Phil was meant to be there. Him batting. Me drinking. Eating. Laughing.
Enjoying Phillip down on one knee, playing shots in a way that others can't. A method that they don't teach in coaching clinics.
Well little brother, how am I meant to hold strong now?
I will cry when they hold a minutes silence for you. My clients will empathise, but they won't really understand.
They won't know about our relationship.
You didn't even know the bloke!
Yeah I did. I knew you Phillip. I admired you.
You represented everything that Australians want to see in their men.
Traits that we respect.
Humble. Strong. Tenacious. Work Ethic.
I will never be able to say to your detractors ‘See, I told you so'.
Fate robbed us of that chance. But that's ok mate.
You and I know how the story was going to play out.
They could only keep saying no for so long. We were going to convince them that saying yes was the only way forward.
63 Not Out was your final innings. Red ink. Unbeaten.

The Bren Ten was the handgun story of the early- to mid-1980s. The pundits drooled and salivated. It was predicted that the new cartridge that came out with it, the 10mm Auto, would take over the law enforcement market. It was not to be. Today, the 10mm is popular only among handgun cognoscenti.
The Bren Ten itself has long since languished on the ash heap of firearms history. Its creator, the living legend Jeff Cooper, wrote in their column in the April 2004 Guns & Ammo: “The Bren Ten was a concept of mine, and while I am not ashamed of it, I admit that this concept was not entirely sound.” The words had the ring of a eulogy.
Pedigree
Col. Cooper inspired the Bren Ten as surely as they created the Scout Rifle concept, and for a while, the pistol became their trademark. Indeed, their trademark was on the pistol; the Raven emblem of Jeff 's famous shooting school Gunsite was prominently emblazoned on the frame of each Bren Ten.
Gun writers of the time raved about the gun. Accuracy! Power! Total reliability! Double action or cocked and locked single action carry optional to the shooter! To hear the gun magazines tell it, all other handguns had been rendered obsolete by the coming of this new and wonderful sidearm.
Many who might have carried them never did, because of the limited production and the even more limited availability of magazines. The good colonel certainly led the charge, but precious few soldiers were behind him.
Some experts of the period were polite about it, but gave the gun short shrift. Chuck Taylor, who until shortly before had been Jeff Cooper's right hand man at Gunsite and apparently had some input into the design, blasted the Bren Ten thoroughly in their review of the actual pistol in SWAT magazine.
Another contemporary expert, Wiley Clapp, would write twenty years later, “For reasons of business, the Bren Ten did not prosper in the marketplace…I don't know why a larger company hasn't picked it up, but I suspect it's because they simply don't feel it's a viable product. I owned one for a time and found it to be a decently accurate pistol that tended to the big-and-heavy side…in the long run, the design failed because it was a big, heavy, complicated and expensive service pistol in a market full of small, light, simple and cheap ones.”
The “Bren Ten cartridge,” the 10mm Auto, would draw more interest…just in different guns. As both a champion shooter and one of the top 1911 pistolsmiths, Mark Morris became a huge fan of the cartridge in the subsequent Colt Delta Elite pistol.
So did Ray Chapman, the first world champion of IPSC, who finished up their match days with an Ed Brown-tuned Delta 10mm before hanging up their competition guns in retirement.
Jerry Miculek, uncontested as the world's fastest double action revolver shooter, once told me the gun they kept at bedside was a Smith & Wesson 10mm auto they won at the Second Chance shoot. Chuck Karwan, in many ways the most vocal and articulate champion of the 10mm, had great praise for the S&W Model 1006, and greater for the Glock 20 in the same caliber.
The latter gun is the choice of rock star and shooter Ted Nugent, both for self-defense and for much of their hunting. Other famous handgun hunters partial to the Glock 10mm are Jim Cirillo and Paco Kelly, both of whom used handguns for much more serious purposes in law enforcement.
Shooting the Bren Ten
I shot only a few Bren Tens, but found them reliable except for the .45 caliber conversion unit, and reasonably accurate. The solid steel weight of this well-made pistol helped make up for the muzzle flip that came from its powerful cartridge and its relatively high bore axis. Trigger pulls were smooth, and workmanship was generally quite good.
Criticism of the gun's “complexity,” even from Jeff Cooper, stemmed largely from a cross-bolt safety run through the slide to act as a firing pin block, which rendered the
gun drop-safe. This was necessary, developers Dixon and Dornaus apparently felt, for safety and liability reasons.
Time has proven them right. I never heard of an accidental discharge lawsuit resulting from a dropped Bren Ten. Operating the dual safety mechanism was no trick; the inner edge of the median joint of the thumb pressed inward to release the crossbolt on its way down to press the thumb safety into firing position.
Only a very small fraction of a second was lost, and if it confused gun experts, it most certainly would have done its job in confusing someone who snatched the on-safe Bren
Ten from its legitimate user.
The “Bren” in Bren Ten comes from Brno, the center of the Czechoslovakian gun industry, and real shooting complaints about the Bren Ten come from its CZ-based design. As on the 9mm CZ 75, the safety is higher than it should be for most hands and shooting grasps; the slide, buried within the frame instead of outside it, leaves too little of that critical moving part for the actuating hand to grasp; and the trigger sits altogether too far forward for maximum leverage in single action, let alone double action, shooting.
In addition, lacking a decocking mechanism, the Bren Ten encouraged the dangerous practice of lowering the hammer on a live round by hand.
In the Glock and S&W incarnations, the 10mm auto is simply a standard model that kicks a little more in return for hitting a little harder. In the 1911 style, the best bet is the installation of a high-efficiency recoil compensator. This slows down the slide velocity and saves the mechanism, as well as the shooter's hand, from buffeting.
I have a Colt Delta Elite “Carry Comp” so rebuilt by Mark Morris. The muzzle jump is so reduced that it almost feels as if it is kicking downward, and it shows no signs of excessive wear despite thousands and thousands of full power 10mm rounds in training and competition.
How you load your 10mm is obviously important. The downloaded, subsonic FBI round – known as the “minus-P” in the circles of the 10mm fans – has the same power as the .40 S&W cartridge that Cooper dubbed “the 10mm Short.” If that's the power level you're comfortable with – about the same as a 19th Century black powder .38/40 revolver – you'll get more bullets and a smaller package with a gun chambered for .40 S&W rather than 10mm Auto.
With the full loads, the 10mm does in fact exceed the .357 Magnum. That caliber's most proven antipersonnel load is a .357-inch diameter 125 grain bullet at 1450 fps; you can get a .400-inch diameter 135 grain bullet going the same speed out of a 10mm.
The .41Magnum thing, however, is an exaggeration for the most part. The only comparison in which that is true is in the Winchester Silvertip line. The 10mm Silvertip is a 175 grain JHP at 1290 fps and 649 fpe, while the .41 Mag Silvertip is a 175 grain JHP at 1250 fps generating 607 fpe.
However, it must be kept in perspective that the Silvertip is among the hottest loads ever factory produced in 10mm Auto, but is slightly downloaded in the .41 Magnum round. Thus, it may be said that while the 10mm Auto poaches into the .41 Magnum's territory, it does not conquer it.

It's the maiden voyage of "Koh Knows," which is basically a weekly Next Gen Stats column dressed up with a few jokes to go along with some Daily Daps (fans of the podcast, what's up).
I'll dig into the numbers a bit harder and give you my takeaways from the week that was while spinning those forward to the weeks ahead. Will I do it shirtless in football pads with a baseball bat draped across my shoulders? I can't promise you that I will, but I can't promise you that I won't.
Let's go.
BACK-TO-BACK MATTY REVIVALS
On the strength of four touchdowns, Matthew Stafford was your QB2 in Week 1 and I buy them as a top-five signal caller moving forward.
I know what you're thinking, "NOOOOOOPE, seen this story before, dude starts out hot, fades late, I'm out." Which, oh by the way, is what people were saying about Matt Ryan last year until about Week 16 at which point the critics were like, "Yeah, this guy might be good ... maybe."
Much of Ryan's mid-career re-emergence was built around working with Kyle Shanahan to modernize their game. Reliance on five- and seven-step drops with low-percentage deep shots were replaced with an effective short passing game that then opened up downfield throws in favorable matchups. Remember, Ryan looked terrible in this system in Year 1. It was in Year 2 when everything clicked and they exploded.
Similarly, Stafford is entering their second full season with Jim Bob Cooter leading the Lions' offensive attack. But in addition to the familiarity with the offensive system, the emergence of Kenny Golladay changes everything.
I USED TO BE ABLE TO THROW A PIGSKIN A QUARTER MILE
Effective deep shots are good for fantasy points. Connecting on a single 30-yard bomb is more points than connecting on three dink-and-dunks totaling 15 yards. However, you also want them to be effective when attacking downfield.
Now, he's no Uncle Rico, but Matthew Stafford's got a big arm and he's pretty good at slinging it downfield. Per Next Gen Stats, Stafford's quarterback rating when throwing it deep (20 or more air yards) was 91.7 last year, markedly better than the league average rating of 75.6.
Not only was they highly effective in that area of the field, but Stafford actually increased their deep passing attempts over the back half of 2016. Stafford saw their attempts downfield increase from 3.3 deep passes per game to 4.4 deep passes per game over the final eight games (league average in 2016 was 3.6 deep passes per game). This is a stat that perks my ears up if I'm a Golladay manager. I'll explain.
While it's true that you could run long routes from basically any alignment, the overall thought is that receivers who line up out wide (i.e. not the slot) will see more opportunities deep down the field.
So who lined up out wide for the Lions you ask? Well, in 2016 it was mostly a mix of Marvin Jones and 5-foot-10 Golden Tate, who surprisingly lined up out wide on 73 percent of theirs snaps.
In Week 1 of 2017? Jones ran nearly all their routes from the outside but Tate lined up out wide on just 17 percent of their snaps, a big fall from their 2016 numbers. Any vacuum left behind by Tate in that positional alignment was filled almost exclusively by rookie Kenny Golladay.
CLICK, CLICK, BOOM!
In addition to being an awesomely terrible (or terribly awesome) Saliva song, it's a good way to describe how the Detroit passing game now looks with Golladay, a big-bodied, physical receiver on the outside who Stafford can trust to make big-time plays. Everything clicks and the scoring could explode.
The emergence of Golladay will allow Jones to be one of the most athletic (6-foot-2, 4.46 40-yard dash time) No. 2 receivers in the NFL. It's a role he's better suited for and one they thrived in while with the Cincinnati Bengals.
It also allows Tate to slide into the slot and wreak havoc underneath. In 2016 Tate, rather remarkably, only lined up in the slot 26 percent of the time.
Wait ... Tate was in the slot just 26 percent of the time?!?
"I'll take Aging Future Hall of Famers for $200, Alex."
Anquan Boldin, ladies and gentlemen, lined up in the slot on a whopping 78 percent of their snaps. With Bolding now retired, Tate played in the slot on 82 percent of their snaps in Week 1. This should get you extremely excited about them in PPR leagues, as the Cooter-led offense features a litany of short passes. We saw the effects as Tate went ballistic in PPR formats to the tune of 10 catches for 107 yards in Week 1.
The overall effects of this shift were on display all game. Stafford ripped apart a strong Arizona defense featuring an extremely talented secondary, completing 70 percent of their passes for 292 yards and four touchdowns.
BABYTRON IS NO DECEPTICON
I don't know who came up with the nickname but it seems apropos given their 6-foot-4 frame and 4.50 40-yard dash time flying around in that Detroit uniform (editor's note: that honor goes to NumberFire's JJ Zachariason, @LateRoundQB on Twitter. Here's the proof).
The rookie out of Northern Illinois has terrific body control and actually thrives fighting through contact, making them an ideal downfield and red-zone threat. I absolutely buy the hype.
Stafford threw it deep twice in Week 1, both times going to Golladay. The two connected on one of those targets -- an impressive 45-yard score. It goes in the book as a 135.4 quarterback rating on the day for Stafford throwing to this part of the field.
But not only is Golladay out here making cray-cray diving catches, he's a load inside the red zone as well.
Again, going back to 2016, you know who led the team in red zone targets? That would be Boldin again. Even at age 35, the future Hall of Famer saw 22 looks from inside the 20-yard line en route to their team-leading eight receiving touchdowns. Golladay should, and most likely will, fill this role.
And keep in mind, Golladay only played on 60 percent of the team's offensive snaps, coming in mostly for Detroit's 11 personnel, which they ran on 78 percent of their offensive plays against the Cardinals. Given the team's continued struggles in the run game (2.65 yards per carry by running backs) and the impressive playmaking ability shown by Golladay, you'd be insane to think the Lions don't stick with more three-receiver sets moving forward, meaning more work for the team's third rounder.
He's exactly what Stafford and this offense needed and they help everyone else find their natural spot on the offense, meaning a potential season-long spike in yardage and touchdowns for Stafford as we saw Sunday.
My bold prediction for both: Stafford will finish as a top-five fantasy quarterback and Golladay will rack up 1,000-ish yards with 10 or more touchdowns. I'm buying both all day long.

An artist's depiction of white dwarf stars Sirius A and B.
A newly discovered star is unlike any ever found. With an outermost layer of 99.9 percent pure oxygen, its atmosphere is the most oxygen-rich in the known universe. Heck, it makes Earth's meager 21 percent look downright suffocating.
The strange stellar oddity is a radically new type of white dwarf star, and was discovered by a team of Brazilian astronomers led by Kepler de Souza Oliveira at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil. The star is unique in the known pool of 32,000 white dwarf stars, and is the only known star of any kind with an almost pure oxygen atmosphere. The new white dwarf has a mouthful of a name—SDSSJ124043.01+671034.68—but has been nicknamed 'Dox' (pronounced Dee-Awks) by Kepler's team. The discovery was reported today in a paper in the journal Science.
"This white dwarf was incredibly unexpected."
"This white dwarf was incredibly unexpected," says Kepler, "And because we had no idea anything like it could even exist, that made it all the more difficult to find."
Missing Gas
Here's a quick refresher: White dwarfs like Dox are the antiques of the cosmos. They're the hyper-dense husks left over when stars largely sputter out of hydrogen and helium fuel. All but the largest 3 percent of stars end up as white dwarfs. Although Dox is only slightly bigger than our home planet, it's 60 percent the mass of our sun.
Boris Gänsicke, an astronomer at the University of Warwick, in the UK, who was not involved in Dox's discovery, confirms that the "exotic white dwarf... has an almost pure oxygen atmosphere, diluted only by traces of neon, magnesium, and silicon," they write in an essay accompanying the Science paper. "This chemical composition is unique among known [white dwarfs] and must arise from an extremely rare process."
Dox presents more than a couple mysteries.
So, what makes Dox's oxygen rich atmosphere so unexpected? Kepler explains that Dox presents more than a couple mysteries. For one, almost all other white dwarfs in the sky have an atmosphere thick with light elements like hydrogen and helium. These light elements are the final dregs of the star's elemental fusion fuel that survived the star's earlier life-cycle. Simply because of their weight, these light elements naturally float to the top of white dwarfs.
"What happened to all these light elements?" asks Kepler "How did they all get stripped away?"
Kepler also explains that although traces of heavier elements like carbon and oxygen can be detected in about one out of every five white dwarfs, it's never quite like this. A white dwarf's atmosphere is never purely one element, and is often diluted in a pool of lighter elements. Perhaps most perplexing, when oxygen atoms are found, they're spied in far heavier white dwarfs. Smaller white dwarfs evolve from smaller stars, which don't fuse together atoms into oxygen as they collapse. By all calculations, Dox would have had to be roughly double its weight to have even forged oxygen atoms in its earlier life. "You have to wonder where this oxygen even came from," says Kepler.
In short, by simply being so weird, Dox completely defies our general, scientific understanding of how stars evolve and eventually form into white dwarfs. But Kepler suggests that maybe this shouldn't be all that surprising. That's because, they argue, scientists have often ignored the wacky results that can come about when stars grow and evolve while locked in a binary dance with other stars—rather than alone.
"I think the main problem is that we [astronomers] have dedicated the last 50 years to calculate the evolution of stars that are not interacting with each other, when at least 30 percent of stars interact with a binary companion," they say.
Kepler believes Dox looks so strange because of an unlikely binary origin-story. Their rough theory goes like this:
At some point Dox may have been a larger white dwarf, locked in a twirling ballet with another star much like our own Sun. These two stars were about the same distance apart as the Sun and Venus are. As Dox's dance partner started to sputter out of Hydrogen fuel, it formed what's called a red giant. It expanded rapidly—becoming so big that it actually engulfed the white dwarf in its outermost layer of gas. Kepler believes Dox would have started siphoning off the red giant's gas onto itself. At some point during that siphoning process, "when it reached a few million degrees, it exploded. That explosion threw all types of matter out. That's when [Dox] might have lost all its hydrogen and helium. This type of situation is known to have happened with other stars, although it's never been seen to leave just oxygen," they say.
The World's Most Boring Job
Dox was discovered in a data mountain of 4.5 million individual star observations, collected over the last 15 years by a New Mexico observatory in a project called the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. It was found by way of a process so grueling that its initial discoverer—one of Kepler's undergraduate students Gustavo Ourique—deserves a mention.
Ourique was looking for strange, new types of white dwarfs in a data pile of 300,000 possible observations. These observations aresimple graphs about what colors of light came from each pinpoint source (called a spectral graph). Because a computer isn't easily programmed with such a vague task as "find something weird and cool," Ourique was challenged with the grunt-work task of physically looking at printed out pages of all 300,000 graphs.
"After a few months they could filter a one or two thousand each day, like reading a book" says Kepler. Yeah, but what a heartbreakingly boring book. That is, at least until it gets thrilling, because after half a year of scanning, and toward the end of the 300,000 graphs, Ourique came across Dox. Because of it's oxygen atmosphere, Dox's spectral graph looked truly unique, and they brought it to Kepler.
Ourique, man, you are a hero.

When Milli Vanilli admitted that the vocals for which the group won a Grammy in 1990 were not its own, the award was returned, contracts were voided, careers were finished, and weaves were ripped out. Hoping to avoid a similar backlash, BMW's M division has been completely transparent with the new M5's lip-syncing soundtrack.
M division engineers discovered that the F10 chassis, like that of so many other new cars these days, is so effective at insulating the cabin from road and engine noise that the M5 lost one of the characteristics that made the previous two iterations such visceral thrills to let off the leash: its bark. To give the driver a better feel for the engine, an exterior recording of the M5's motor plays through the car's stereo. The precise sample is determined by engine load and rpm. Some of the real engine notes are still audible to the driver, so the recording is more of a backing track. BMW says the setup helps the driver shift by ear and reduces the chances of bumping the rev limiter when using the full rpm range.
BMW is hardly alone when it comes to enhancing engine sounds. When Lexus launched the LFA, the company wanted drivers to experience the full range of the car's V-10. To achieve this, Lexus contracted Yamaha—not the Yamaha that built F1 engines in the '80s and '90s but rather the musical-instrument division—and its Center for Advanced Sound Technologies to tune the LFA's symphony hall (cabin) for the audience (driver). It treated the engine as a sound generator and developed components to direct all of the V-10's wail to the driver.

High-tech sound tuning is not limited to six-figure vehicles, though. Ford installed a resonator pipe between the Mustang GT's V-8 and its fire wall. The Boss 302 takes this further by adding a second pair of exhaust pipes tucked behind the rocker panels. Owners can remove restrictor plates located just upstream of the side exits to open the exhaust. The resulting note causes pedestrians to duck and cover.

Volkswagen previously used a resonator tube similar to the Mustang's in its GTI but has switched to what it calls a “Soundaktor.” This system is like the M5's, in that an audio file is stored on the car's computer and then played during certain throttle applications. Unlike the more selective M5 setup, VW's broadcasts all the noise from under the hood through a dedicated speaker located near the engine's throttle body. Soundaktor speakers are currently making noise in the GTI, GLI, and Beetle Turbo.
Porsche's new Sound Symposer, fitted to the new (991) 911 and forthcoming Panamera GTS, is another intake-noise amplifier. As the 911 has grown up, so have the needs of its ­drivers: One need in particular is quiet cruising. Wide, low-profile rubber howls at 80 mph, and damping that distraction also diminishes the primal sounds of the engine. Porsche calls its amplifier an “acoustic channel,” and it consists of a tube housing a diaphragm and a valve. When an occupant pushes the sport button on the ­center console, the valve opens and the diaphragm goes to work amplifying the mechanical sounds radiating from the intake plenum.
It's kind of like a timpani at the symphony, except that you don't have to sit through an actual symphony. Or, for that matter, Milli Vanilli.

Turkey's government has sacked 2,346 university staff for suspected ties to July's attempted military coup in the country.
The sackings, announced in a 1 September decree as part of a wider purge of 40,000 civil servants, are the first of an expected wave of dismissals under powers granted by state-of-emergency rules following the coup. Those fired are unable to appeal, cannot hold any government positions in the future, and will have their passports revoked.
Turkey's government has blamed the Gülen movement — a religious organization — for the coup attempt. But academics have protested that some of those now being fired are not Gülen followers, but simply opponents of particular government policies. More than 40 of those sacked, for example, had in January signed an ‘Academics for Peace' petition that had called for an end to violence between government forces and Kurdish separatists.
Hundreds of the signatories of that petition have already faced investigations and several have been suspended, according to a website set up by some of the petition's supporters. “This latest attempt to purge Academics for Peace by linking them to coup plotters is outrageous and unacceptable,” a statement on the petition's website said.
More sackings expected
“Academics with absolutely no links with the Gülenists, who had even actively opposed Gülenists in the past, are being sacked alongside suspected sect members,” said the Association of University Councils — an academic society that represents young researchers — in a press statement.
The Gülenists had been close allies to the government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and had used the connection to place their supporters in key positions in the judiciary, education and science. But in 2013, the alliance broke down and Erdoğan (who has been Turkey's president since 2014) designated the Gülen movement a terrorist group.
More firings of academics are anticipated. In the first days of the state of emergency that was declared after the coup attempt, the Turkish Council of Higher Education (YÖK) told universities to identify and side-line academics and administrators suspected of being Gülenists.
“Many of those fired were already under investigation. It was completely unexpected that so many would be sacked en masse, before the investigations were concluded,” says Mehmet Somel, an evolutionary biologist from the Middle East Technical University in Ankara.
In July, the YÖK had also ordered all 1,577 of the country's university deans to leave their posts; although they may reapply for their jobs, the move seemed designed to tighten Erdoğan's political control of the higher education sector. And it told all academics who were out of the country to return home. Meanwhile, the science agency TÜBİTAK has suspended its fellowships and postponed all major project-funding calls.
The Association of University Councils says that the government's measures after the coup are “systematically harming science in Turkey”.
President Donald Trump threw their support behind Sen. Luther Strange in Alabama's Republican Senate primary.
Strange, also backed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, lost the election to former Judge Roy Moore on Tuesday night. The president then deleted some of their tweets supporting Strange.
"Luther Strange has been shooting up in the Alabama polls since my endorsement. Finish the job — vote today for 'Big Luther,'" Trump wrote Tuesday in one of the messages, archived by nonprofit news site ProPublica.
Two other deleted tweets urged Alabama to "get out and vote for Luther Strange" and said they will "never let you down."
After Moore won, Trump congratulated them in a tweet. They said Strange "started way back" and "ran a good race."
Strange was appointed to the Senate earlier this year to fill the vacancy created by former Sen. Jeff Sessions joining the Trump administration as attorney general. They were considered a reliable vote on most Republican policies. A McConnell-aligned super PAC funneled millions into the state to support Strange.
Stephen Nathaniel Frick (born September 30, 1964)[1] is an American astronaut and a veteran of two Space Shuttle missions. Raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Frick graduated from Pine-Richland High School in 1982, earned a degree in aerospace engineering from the United States Naval Academy in 1986, was commissioned as a United States Navy officer, and trained as a F/A-18 fighter pilot.[2] Stationed aboard the carrier USS Saratoga, they flew combat missions during the Gulf War and then earned a master's degree in aeronautical engineering from the Naval Postgraduate School in 1994.[2][3]
Frick was selected as a NASA astronaut candidate in 1996 and was trained as a Space Shuttle pilot. They piloted mission STS-110, a docking mission with the International Space Station.[2]
In July 2006, Frick was assigned to command the crew of STS-122. The 12-day mission delivered the European Space Agency's Columbus laboratory and returned Expedition 16 Flight Engineer Daniel M. Tani to Earth. The mission launched February 7, 2008, and touched down February 20, 2008.[2] NASA announced their retirement in July 2015.[4]

The Mag and Mark Jensen have had a Canal+ interview with Newcastle midfielder Yohan Cabaye translated from the French, and Yohan has revealed that they had an offer to join Tottenham in the summer to replace Luka Modric, who went to Real Madrid, but they turned it down and preferred to stay at Newcastle – good for them – in fact great for him.
Yohan Cabaye – preferred to stay at Newcastle
When Yohan Cabaye first arrived at Newcastle last summer, and it was a huge coup for us to get such a talented player for just €5M, they said they also had offers from Spain, but wanted to play in the Premier League, which they thought was the best league in the world – he's right there.
This is what Yohan told Canal+:
“For me the Premier League is the best league in the world, you have to work twice as hard and we know about the high tempo in every match. This is what attracted me and I will develop physically.”
And their manager at Lille, Rudi Garcia, thinks that Yohan is now a much better player than they were while at the French club, with their extra conditioning and playing against top sides every weekend – and of course the games are being broadcast live around the world, and seem to be catching on even over here in the US.
This is what Rudi Garcia said:
“A year on Cabaye is stronger, they have reached maturity, they are a complete player, they can do everything and they can play in the midfield of all top teams in the world”
We heard from Newcastle manager Alan Pardew in early September that a number of Newcastle stars had been tempted away by big clubs in August, and it was thought that Yohan Cabaye was one of them, and it seems it was Tottenham who came in for Yohan – but they turned them down.
This is what Yohan had to say about that:
“The offer from Tottenham was to replace Modric.” “If I had wanted to leave I would have; I have not left, I was not meant to leave as I am still here and I hope a lot of good things will come out of it”.
Alan Pardew was then asked if their French International central midfielder could play for a top team, and the answer to that must have been obvious, after Yohan looked one of France's best players in June during the Euro 2012 Championships in Poland and Ukraine.
In any case, this is what Alan Pardew said:
“Could they play for a top team?-Yes, do I want them to go elsewhere? – NO”.
Cabaye's fellow central midfielder at Newcastle, Cheick Tiote, also turned down a move to Chelsea, on the same day last year that Andy Carroll left for Liverpool, so it's always good to have players on Tyneside who want to play for Newcastle United – very good in fact.
We can mark down Yohan Cabaye now as one of those players, and they will have endeared themselves to the hearts of Newcastle fans everywhere, by the decision they made in the summer – to stay on Tyneside.
It's great to (still) have Yohan Cabaye at Newcastle.

WASHINGTON (AP) — One of President Donald Trump's top intelligence directors is the latest person to be fired in a string of shake-ups at the White House and National Security Council.
Ezra Cohen-Watnick became a focal point for top national security advisers earlier this year when CIA leaders raised concerns about them with Trump's national security adviser H.R. McMaster.
A White House statement Wednesday said, “General McMaster appreciates the good work accomplished in the NSC's Intelligence directorate under Ezra Cohen's leadership.”
It said McMaster “has determined that, at this time, a different set of experiences is best-suited to carrying that work forward.”
McMaster moved to replace Cohen-Watnick when the concerns were raised in March, but Cohen-Watnick appealed to Trump's top advisers, Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner, who got Trump to intervene to save their job.
Cohen-Watnick was a protege of Trump's initial national security adviser, Michael Flynn, having worked for them at the Pentagon's intelligence shop.
As the NSC's senior director for intelligence programs, Cohen-Watnick was one of about a dozen people in the White House with access to a full range of classified information, including details of U.S. covert programs. Their position also gives them the ability to request intelligence products from agencies.
In March, The New York Times identified Cohen-Watnick as one of two White House staffers who helped House intelligence committee chairperson Devin Nunes view secret reports.
A U.S. official confirmed to The Associated Press at the time that Cohen-Watnick had access to that kind of intelligence materials, but maintained they did not play a role in helping the member of congress access the documents.

E-cigarettes, even the ones that are plugged into the correct charger and don't explode , have a problem. Well, their users have a problem. Some former cigarette smokers who are used to flinging butts out the window when they finish a smoke are having trouble letting go of their nasty habit. The trouble is that metal e-cig cartridges are, well, metal, and puncture tires out on the roads.
“We have seen usually one or two [nicotine cartridges] a week puncturing the tire,” the manager of a tire shop told TV station WGAL. The cartridges, which are made out of metal, are much more harmful than a cigarette butt when they land on the road. “When they slash a tire,” the shop manager explains, “they usually leave a pretty big gash in it.”
Unlike a nail, the sharp cartridges don't leave a simple hole in the tire that can be plugged up. They leave a gash that can't be patched.
So, smokers, as you use the battery-powered device to break one bad habit, please try to break another. Keep a trash bag in your car for the cartridges.

A US Navy helicopter crashed on Thursday in Oman during a transport mission, and the fate of its five-member crew is unknown, the US military said, ruling out an attack.
The MH-53E Sea Dragon, used for long-range mine sweeping, crashed 58 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of the Omani capital Muscat “while conducting heavy lift support operations,” the Bahrain-based US Fifth Fleet said.
The Fifth Fleet monitors the waters of the Gulf and keeps an eye on Iran.
“The crash was not due to any sort of hostile activity and the status of the five crew members is still being determined,” the statement said.
Another MH-53E was on the scene to assist the search and rescue operation.
The US Navy has boosted its mine-sweeping operations in recent weeks in response to Iran's repeated threats to close the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of the world's traded oil passes.
It was not immediately clear whether the helicopter that crashed, assigned to Helicopter Mine Countermeasure Squadron 15, was part of the reinforcements.

A handwritten symphony manuscript by Malcolm Arnold has been rediscovered by their daughter on eBay, three decades after they are thought to have given it away while suffering from mental illness.
The British composer wrote their Seventh Symphony in 1973 and, although it exists in a printed version, the original handwritten score had been missing for more than 30 years.
The score, which shows a strong influence of Mahler, was composed in Dublin and at Walton's Mediterranean home on the island of Ischia. Each of the three movements is a portrait of one of Arnold's three children, Katherine, Robert and Edward.
Their daughter Katherine, represented in the Allegro energico movement, had been searching for the original score for years, spurred on by the knowledge that it was dedicated to them and their two younger brothers. ‘It was extraordinary to have it back. It was very emotional,' they say.
They discovered the work the eBay website, put up for sale by a Hampstead-based shop called Flogit4U. ‘It was in its original box with the tissue paper from when it was bound,' they say.
The Telegraph reports that Arnold, ‘a manic depressive, schizophrenic and alcoholic, could have given the work away in lieu of payment to a plumber or repairman, after the Court of Protection stopped them accessing their bank account'.
The Seventh Symphony was commissioned by the New Philharmonia Orchestra and premiered at the Royal Festival Hall in May 1974, with the composer conducting. The manuscript is currently on loan to the library of Eton College as part of a special archive of manuscripts.
Tim Johnson, director of music at Eton, is keen for the public to come and see the work. ‘The key thing is we want people from beyond Eton to come and visit it and it's an amazing manuscript in itself,' they say. This can be arranged via appointment.
What kind of people is Pope Francis surrounding themselves with? The fact that this Pope decided to choose German professor John Schellnhuber as their chief climate change advisor is raising a lot of eyebrows. Schellnhuber doesn't believe in God, but as you will see below, they do appear to believe in ‘Gaia'. Schellnhuber has also advocated for the establishment of an “Earth Constitution”, a “Global Council” directly elected by the citizens of the world, and a “Planetary Court” that would serve as the pinnacle of a planetary legal system. In addition, they believe that the “carrying capacity” of our planet is less than one billion people. This is the man that the Pope has chosen to advise them on the issue that Pope Francis has made the centerpiece of their papacy.
The concept of ‘Gaia' has deep roots in ancient paganism. Many of the advocates of the ‘Gaia hypothesis‘ do not consider themselves to be religious, but in reality it is a kind of “scientific pantheism”. This quasi-scientific theory was popularized by James Lovelock in their book entitled “Gaia: A New Look At Life On Earth“, and apparently this is a theory that Schellnhuber endorses. The following is an extended excerpt from a recent article by William M. Briggs…
In the Gaia Principle, Mother Earth is alive, and even, some think, aware in some ill-defined, mystical way. The Earth knows man and their activities and, frankly, isn't too happy with him. This is what we might call “scientific pantheism,” a kind that appeals to atheistic scientists. It is an updated version of the pagan belief that the universe itself is God, that the Earth is at least semi-divine — a real Brother Sun and Sister Water! Mother Earth is immanent in creation and not transcendent, like the Christian God. What's this have to do with Schellnhuber? In the 1999 Nature paper “‘Earth system' analysis and the second Copernican revolution,” they said: Ecosphere science is therefore coming of age, lending respectability to its romantic companion, Gaia theory, as pioneered by Lovelock and Margulis. This hotly debated ‘geophysiological' approach to Earth-system analysis argues that the biosphere contributes in an almost cognizant way to self-regulating feedback mechanisms that have kept the Earth's surface environment stable and habitable for life. Geo-physiological, in case you missed it. Cognizant, in black and white. So dedicated is Schellnhuber to this belief that they say “the Gaia approach may even include the influence of biospheric activities on the Earth's plate-tectonic processes.” Not the other way around, mind you, where continental drift and earthquakes effects life, but where life effects earthquakes. They elaborate: Although effects such as the glaciations may still be interpreted as over-reactions to small disturbances — a kind of cathartic geophysiological fever — the main events, resulting in accelerated maturation by shock treatment, indicate that Gaia faces a powerful antagonist. Rampino has proposed personifying this opposition as Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction.
So why would the Pope rely on the “expertise” of someone that does not believe in God, but that argues that “Gaia faces a powerful antagonist”?
Perhaps someone should ask him.
And someone should also ask the Pope why they are hanging around with someone that believes that our planet is overpopulated by six billion people…
Schellnhuber is most famous for predicting that the “carrying capacity” of the earth is “below” 1 billion people. When confronted with this, they called those who quoted them “liars.” But they then repeated the same claim, saying, “All I said was that if we had unlimited global warming of eight degrees warming, maybe the carrying capacity of the earth would go down to just 1 billion, and then the discussion would be settled.” And they have often said that this temperature tipping point would be reached — unless “actions” were taken.
Schellnhuber is also an unashamed globalist. In a previous article, I discussed how they believe that we need a global government, a global constitution and a global court that would have authority over all the other courts on the planet. The following is an excerpt from a very disturbing article that they authored…
Let me conclude this short contribution with a daydream about those key institutions that could bring about a sophisticated — and therefore more appropriate — version of the conventional “world government” notion. Global democracy might be organized around three core activities, namely (i) an Earth Constitution; (ii) a Global Council; and (iii) a Planetary Court. I cannot discuss these institutions in any detail here, but I would like to indicate at least that: – the Earth Constitution would transcend the UN Charter and identify those first principles guiding humanity in its quest for freedom, dignity, security and sustainability; – the Global Council would be an assembly of individuals elected directly by all people on Earth, where eligibility should be not constrained by geographical, religious, or cultural quotas; and – the Planetary Court would be a transnational legal body open to appeals from everybody, especially with respect to violations of the Earth Constitution.
So why is Pope Francis surrounding themselves with such people?
Do they have similar hopes for the future?
Without a doubt, the Pope's latest encyclical fully embraces Schellnhuber's views on climate change, but it doesn't stop there. The Pope also expressed a very negative view of human progress, and they appeared to be echoing many of the exact same talking points that radical environmentalists have been hammering us with for years. The following comes from a recent article by Steven Malanga…
The encyclical, whose title is derived from a line from St. Francis of Assisi's Canticle of the Sun (“Be praised, My Lord, through all your Creatures”), is being welcomed by some in the scientific community because it proclaims that climate change is real and that humanity must address it. But the nearly 38,000-word document—most of which is not about climate change—actually reads like a giant step backward for the Church's social teaching: a rejection of technological progress; a dark, narrow vision of human nature that ignores the enormous gains the world has made in alleviating human suffering; and an almost antihuman call, reminiscent of the most radical environmentalists, to reduce human activity drastically as the only way to save the planet. As Michael Shellenberger, president of the Breakthrough Institute and co-author of An Ecomodernist Manifesto, observed: “When [the] Pope speaks of ‘irrational faith in human progress' I want them to visit the Congo to see what life is like when there is no progress.”
So what does all of this mean?
Could it be possible that this Pope is far more radical than most people ever imagined?
If so, what does that mean for the future of Catholicism?

Occasionally, Craigslist offers us a naked glimpse into the world we live in now and the insufferable private lives of its inhabitants, much as it offers us a window into the horrors of SF rental properties. Today this comes via a job posting that went up around 1 a.m. this morning for a personal assistant in South Park that basically sounds like indentured servitude and psychological torture for $25-$30 an hour, depending on your tolerance of either of the above.
The posting comes from a 30-something couple who describe themselves as executives who have crazy work lives these days "which means that we don't have time to maintain our personal lives." What that amounts to (and I'm going to assume the poster is female for reasons you'll understand) is that this couple has resorted to eating "unhealthy take-out and processed foods," "personal social media accounts are neglected," they don't go on date nights because they don't have time to open an app and make a reservation, and vacations aren't taken because "there's no time to plan them." The dog needs walks and brushing. The dishes need washing. Also, "nail polish gets chipped and remains chipped, investment opportunities go un-researched," and "I buy fresh flowers but don't have time to trim daily and change the water."
[Update: The couple appears very real, they've responded to various media inquiries, and now they admit they're actually "40-something."]
Basically their lives are utter hell, and they need someone with a litany of characteristics, sensibilities, and abilities to do their errands, clip their toenails, post to their Instagram, and attend to their every whim so that they can sit on their laptops and work work work, and hopefully go to dinner sometimes.
Now, while it's a given that the job of personal assistant  especially in Hollywood!  takes a certain kind of person with a great deal of patience, a subservient streak, and a high threshold for abuse, the requirements for this job, and the description of the ideal candidate  which is really an unvarnished look into this one person's manic psyche  is pretty special:
You aren't dramatic or tightly wound, however, you're also not lazy or sloth-like (nothing against sloths). You're level-headed and your friends think you have great judgment. You're down to earth, not cocky, humble, and always willing to admit when you're wrong. You aren't too stubborn to apologize. You don't get defensive and deflect. You own your mistakes and see them as opportunities to improve. You have confidence in yourself and although you are very empathetic, you rarely get overwhelmed by your emotions. You aren't dramatic and you aren't having regular melt-downs. You're warm, welcoming, and always down for a good time. You take pride in your work quality (no matter what it is -- big or small) and believe everything you create is a reflection of you and your character/abilities so you want it to be good. You notice inefficiencies and tend to find ways to save time, streamline, or automate where you can. You're observant and detail-oriented. You always know where your keys are or where your wallet is because you make it a point to place them in the same place. You have a great memory and rarely have to say "Oh, I forgot." You believe that there's a place for everything and everything should be in its place. You're naturally organized and clean. You don't like messiness. You feel compelled to straighten items if they're crooked. Aesthetics, design, and beauty in life are things that you notice and appreciate. It genuinely makes you happy to help others and make others smile. You find it rewarding to do things for others. (If you don't feel this way, you will either hate this role or it will be awkward for us because you won't seem happy.) Your friends think that you're the one in your group who has their act together the most in terms of being responsible, responsive, and risk-averse. You take pride in working smart vs. working hard. You do things well AND you do it as quickly as possible. You consistently strive for both quality and speed. You like to laugh and your friends think you can be funny. You smile and/or laugh when you tell a joke or say something humorous (dry senses of humor need not apply)! You care about visual presentation and delivery of your words. You enjoy making things look nice. You enjoy making things smell nice. You have a kind heart and try to not be selfish. You are generous with your attention and love. You are a strong communicator and can tell an engaging story. If something needs to get done, you find a way. You're very comfortable with technology and devices. You use your smartphone all the time. You use your laptop all the time. Google is your best friend. You take pride in how you look -- whatever that "look" or style may be for you. At the same time, you also want to be practical and functional (e.g., you're "bohemian chic" but avoid the giant wedges that will prevent you from hustling around town, you're "cool hipster" but don't wear the super tight jeans that won't leave you room in your pockets to hold my dog's potty bags, you're totally "minimalistic modern" but avoid the white on white look so you're not afraid to get dirty when cooking, etc.)
And that's not all!! The commitment is basically seven days a week, with on-call required 24-7 for "urgent" matters. And you're required to swim into the ocean if the dog ever swims out too far, to fetch him. You also had better enjoy giving mani-pedis, have a good sense of style, watch Game of Thrones, work out regularly when you're not tending to this couple's every need, and not drink more than FIVE DRINKS PER WEEK. It doesn't even pay as well as this $175K/yr gig that a rich Noe Valley couple was offering last year.

And (Jesus Christ), they ask as part of the application process that you write an email describing how you're both perfect for the job and imperfect, and "record and attach a 5 min video of you answering ALL of the following: What did you like about this posting? Confirm if this posting applies to you 100% (including personality description, qualifications, schedule, responsibilities, etc.)... Can you cook us delicious food? What else should we know about you?" and more.
Are these the worst people in San Francisco? Should we take this as an example of what New San Francisco hath wrought on this city where once upon a time the joke was "San Francisco is where young people go to retire"?
I'm going to say no, because a) I'm sure there's someone worse, and b) perhaps this job posting came out of the mind of an extremely stressed, overworked person who believes in the magic of fictional servants like Mary Poppins and Pepper Potts, and who really just needs a Xanax and a bottle of wine before they hurt someone.
Know anybody with absolutely zero pride or self-worth who really, really needs a job? Bonus points if they have no life of their own and are willing to perform sexual favors for one or the other half of this couple when the other is too busy sending emails.

Superdry plc is a UK branded clothing company, and owner of the Superdry label.
Superdry products combine vintage Americana styling with Japanese inspired graphics. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index (at 1190.00 per share as of 6/09/18).
History [ edit ]
Flag over the Regent Street Superdry Store in London
Cult Clothing Co was established by Ian Hibbs and Julian Dunkerton in Cheltenham in 1985, at which time it was trading as "Cult Clothing".[2][3] It expanded during the 1990s and established stores in a number of UK university towns and cities, from Oxford and Cambridge to Edinburgh and Belfast.
During this period, Dunkerton met James Holder who at the time was running skatewear brand Bench.[4] In 2003, they joined forces to found Superdry, opening its first store in Covent Garden in London in 2004.[5][4]
Under Theo Karpathios, a nationwide then global expansion of Superdry took place.[6] The business floated on the London Stock Exchange in March 2010.[7] Dunkerton appeared in the Sunday Times Rich List 2010, and was estimated to be worth £180m.[8] The company issued a profits warning and placed its store opening plans under review in February 2012; the share price quickly dropped by 18%.[9]
On 22 October 2014, it was announced that Dunkerton stepped down as CEO of Superdry and was replaced by Euan Sutherland, the ex-CEO of The Co-operative Group.[10] In February 2016 Dunkerton sold four million shares at £12 per share (for a total of £48 Million), but remained the largest shareholder with a 27% stake in the group.[11]
On 8 January 2018 SuperGroup plc changed its name to Superdry plc.[12]

Superdry does not overtly advertise and does not actively pursue celebrity endorsement except a 2015 collaboration with Idris Elba. The company's "Brad" leather jacket sold 70,000 units from 2007 to mid-2009, becoming one of the best-sellers for the company, after it was worn by football player David Beckham.[13]
The company's products include frequently meaningless excerpts of Japanese text. Consumers of the brand are often unaware of its UK heritage and will often perceive it as having Japanese origins due to these decorative texts.[citation needed] The company explained to a Japanese television crew in 2011 that they deliberately use simple machine translation to generate Japanese text, and that they are aware that the texts often have no meaning.[14] The Japanese text incorporated in the brand's logo—極度乾燥(しなさい) (kyokudo kansō (shinasai))—literally translates as "Extreme dry (Do it)",[15][unreliable source?] the text in brackets being due to the translation software used offering alternatives depending on whether dry is intended as a noun (e.g., super dryness) or an imperative, (e.g., dry this shirt out).[citation needed]

Week Four of the Gfinity Elite Series is done and dusted, with Epsilon still remaining unbeaten series-wise. They've now secured back-to-back wins and are creeping up the table – breathing down the necks of EnVyUs Academy who are still yet to drop a map.
Epsilon's UK player smooya has called out EnVyUs, warning the Frenchmen that they're coming for them and jesting “they're not that good”. It comes after Epsilon dispatched Team Infused by two games to zero.
The first map was Epsilon's pick and was Mirage, where after a close first half Epsilon stamped their authority on the game in the second half. They exuded confidence on their way to a 16-10 win on their own map pick. It wasn't as much fun for Infused player redSNK who only managed five frags in 26 rounds.
After Mirage we went to Inferno. The map swung backwards and forwards during the first half, with Infused actually winning it by eight rounds to seven. Epsilon had clearly had enough, though. The T-side was faultless, only dropping a single round on their way to an impressive 16-9 victory.
In other results today, EnVyUs Academy cemented their place at the top, whilst exceL and Endpoint fought out a closely contested draw. Prophecy rebounded from their crushing 16-0 defeat to EnVy last week to take a series against Reason.
There were big plays, intricate strategy and ridiculous reactions. All of the ingredients were there for an epic evening of CS:GO and boy did it deliver. The Counter-Strike will return next Saturday live from the Gfinity Esports Arena once more.
All heads now turn to Rocket League. There's flying cars and football. The concept is genius, and the players are even better. Action gets underway at 5pm on BBC Three.

On July 16, 1988, Florence Griffith-Joyner set the women's 100 meters world record of 10.49 at Michael A. Carroll Track and Soccer Stadium in Indianapolis. Saturday evening, the Carolina RailHawks visited Carroll Stadium and tried to turn their pivotal match against the Indy Eleven into a track meet, running out a rare 3-5-2 formation designed to push as many attackers forward, knowing three points were essential to preserve Carolina's tenuous playoff hopes.
But it was Indy Eleven that ended up running all over the RailHawks, as a first-half goal from Justin Braun and a duo of second-half scores paced Indy's 3-0 victory. It is Carolina's second straight loss this week after faltering last Wednesday at home against Rayo OKC.
An active, aggressive RailHawks squad held their own throughout the bulk of the first half. Fullbacks Kareem Moses and Steven Miller pushed higher along with edges, and midfielder Tiyi Shipalane teamed with forward Matt Fondy up top.
In the 32nd minute, Matt Watson sent a cross that Moses nodded back to Fondy, who headed it into the net an apparent goal. But the linesman said the trajectory of Watson's ball crossed the byline on its way into the box and disallowed the score.
It appeared the teams were headed into halftime scoreless until Indy struck in the 45th minute. A Sinisa Ubiparipovic cross found a streaking Braun, who cut across defender Simon Mensing's left shoulder and deposited their running header for the 1-0 lead.
In the 76th minute, Braun found themselves clear on goal before the referee whistled Mensing for tripping them up just outside the area. Mensing earned a booking, and a minute later second-half sub Nicki Paterson punched their free kick through a hole in the RailHawks' dike and past goalkeeper Brian Sylvestre to double Indy's advantage.
Adding insult to ignominy, a 90th minute counter attack saw an unmarked Don Smart center to a charging Souleymane Youla, who converted the easy putaway to account for the final 3-0 scoreline.
Omar Bravo traveled with the RailHawks to Indianapolis, but didn't see action due to a nagging quad injury.
Carolina's starting lineup tonight included Tiyi Shipalane and Austin da Luz, who didn't make the XI for Wednesday's home loss to Rayo OKC. Brian Shriver, who also saw the bench Wednesday, didn't see action tonight until the second stanza. The RailHawks' foray into analytics this week netted them zero of the three points they desperately needed from their last two games to stay within striking distance of the league's final postseason berth.
The RailHawks (10-7-13, 37 pnts.) aren't mathematically eliminated from the NASL playoff race, but the practicalities are all but insurmountable. Minnesota United's victory over FC Edmonton tonight puts it four points and an unreachable goal differential ahead of Carolina, and that doesn't even account for the other four teams now ahead of the RailHawks in the NASL's overall table. Carolina closes out its 2016 home campaign next Saturday, October 22 against Minnesota United, then completes their regular season the next weekend at Puerto Rico FC.

I am working with the diagrams package for haskell, and I am using the SVG backend. I embed the SVG markup directly into an HTML document, so that the graph as a part of a web page. I have built a pretty cool looking bar graph, and I would like to add some basic interactivity to it. For example, when you hover over a bar, I'd like to make the color lighter. Or maybe something would pop up as well. The way that I would like to accomplish this is by setting the class attributes of some of the SVG nodes. Is this possible with the diagrams package? I know that it can target multiple backends and that that class attribute likely has no meaningful counterpart in most of them, but I was wondering if there is nevertheless a way to sneak in backend-specific information. Thanks for any insights that anyone can provide.
The FBI probe of Hillary Clinton took a major step forward this week with news that the guy who ran their illicit home-brew email has been granted immunity.
Clinton aide Bryan Pagliano had invoked their Fifth Amendment rights in refusing to testify or cooperate with investigators.
A tech with the 2008 Clinton campaign, they got hired for related duties when they took over at State — then won the nearly $140,000-a-year side job of setting up and maintaining their private email system.
Former top-notch federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy says the grant of immunity strongly suggests that either a grand jury has already been empaneled to consider charges in this case — or that the feds expect to empanel one soon.
So much for Clinton's claim that this is a perfunctory investigation in which they have nothing to fear criminally.
Sorry, Madam Secretary, the FBI doesn't “perfunctorily” grant immunity. And the probe is apparently in the hands of career national-security prosecutors, including one from the team that won a guilty plea from former CIA chief Gen. David Petraeus.
You begin to see why she's refused to hold a press conference for three months now.
It's not just Clinton at risk here: Top aides such as Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills were also clearly involved in the improper handling of the nation's secrets. Indeed, the FBI's reportedly looking into whether aides traded passwords to illegally move info from classified servers to the private system.
We already know that more than 2,000 Clinton emails contained classified information, including dozens with the most confidential stuff. At issue is who'll take the fall for improper handling of the secrets.
Be glad the FBI's on the case. The State Department has announced that its investigation won't wrap up 'til after Election Day.
Clearly, Clinton still has powerful fans at Foggy Bottom. But how many do they have at the Justice Department?
President Obama has publicly claimed there's no scandal here — a signal of where they want the FBI investigation to lead.
If the nonpolitical attorneys move to file charges anyway, do they get quashed? If so, how many will resign in public protest?
We'd like to think the legal system could honestly resolve this case — but it's most likely to come down to politics.

About a month ago, some took offense at our characterization of the Chair-hewlettpackard-man as a “bearded mutant-cum-supreme genocidal overlord” after we predicted to the dot that their monetary policy would eventually lead to a global, well, genocide, presumably first in the developing world.
Following riots, self-immolations and outright revolutions in Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Yemen and Egypt, in the span of a few shorts weeks, we believe we have been once again validated. Putting the period in any debate of what Bernanke's runaway money printing means to the life-expectancy of increasing number of people, is the latest news coming out of Sudan where “security forces on Tuesday arrested opposition leader Hassan al-Turabi and eight other party officials after they called for a “popular revolution” if Khartoum did not reverse price rises.”
And since economic slack in Sudan is roughly in line with that of the abovementioned other 5 countries, it is safe to say that the bulk of this move is speculation frenzy related, which in turn is purely a function of pervasive and free global liquidity. And this is still just the beginning. As Bernanke will not stop before the Dow hits roughly 36,000 expect these kinds of headlines to be an hourly occurrence.
More from Reuters:
Turabi's arrest comes at a politically sensitive time for the government of President Omar Hassan al Bashir, who stands to lose control over the oil-producing south which last week voted in an independence referendum. It also comes as Tunisia grapples with fallout from the ouster of its long-time president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, who fled the country on Friday after three weeks of violent unrest sparked by social grievances. Sudan's opposition threatened on Sunday to take to the streets if the government did not remove its finance minister and dismantle parliament over the decision to raise prices on a range of goods. “This is criminal – how can they arrest a man who is 78 years old and put them in prison? We are scared for him,” Turabi's tearful wife Wisal al-Mahdi told Reuters. Ben Ali's overthrow in Tunisia has reverberated across the Arab world, raising concerns about stability in other countries in the region which share the same mix of social, economic and political problems.
Sudan's price increases have sparked student protests in the country's northern agricultural heartland and Khartoum. The country is grappling with a current account deficit and a currency devaluation that is driving up inflation. This month Khartoum cut subsidies on petroleum products and key commodity sugar, prompting protests over the past week, quelled only by baton-wielding police firing teargas.
And on the topic of price increases specifically:
Perhaps it is time someone at 60 Minutes had a follow-up interview with Blackhawk Ben, asking them if a united developing world revolution is something they are 100% confident they can also contain…
Make way for another startup that wants to shake up the world of music and audio technology. Devialet, the French developer of high-end speakers and the IP behind the sound systems that make them go boom, has raised €100 million ($106 million). This is a strategic growth round that is bringing in a number of high-profile new investors — and with them, a lot more audio opportunities for the Paris-based startup.
In the words of co-founder and CEO Quentin Sannie, Devialet's ambition is to change how we hear sound from any device. “We have developed some very breakthrough sound technology,” they said in an interview earlier today, “and we think it has the ability to be the reference technology for all audio in the future.”
The Series C round, one of the biggest ever for a startup in France, was led by Ginko Ventures, Foxconn's European investment arm, and also included participation from Foxconn itself, carmaker Groupe Renault, Sharp Corporation (now owned by Foxconn), Andy Rubin's Playground Global (which itself is raising $500 million for a new fund), Jay-Z's Roc Nation, and Korelya Capital, an investment fund headed by Fleur Pellerin (France's former Secretary of State for Digital affairs) in partnership with Naver and its subsidiary Line.
Other investors in this round include Qatar's Future French Champions, CM-CIC Investissement and BPI France.
Devialet is best known today for two speakers that it has produced (both made in France): the Expert, which retails for multiple thousands of dollars; and the Phantom, a smaller device that sells for around a more “modest” $2,000.
These speakers have won a ton of awards and rave reviews for what is a radical approach to producing sound: Devialet has figured out a way of removing all distortion to produce a giant sound with a strong bass line, from what are otherwise pretty compact pieces of kit. Devialet complements this with a slick design and gesture-based controllers.
Some may balk at the price. But audiophiles who hear the speakers “fall in love” with them, Sannie claims. “The product speaks for itself, and we seduce our customers. The Phantom is a very emotional experience.” And, if you have the financial means, it seems to also be a very acquisitive and addictive one, too: Andy Rubin has bought 160 Phantom speakers (not just for himself; but to help spread the word about them among their friends).
“I am a huge fan of Devialet,” they said in a statement. “I love the technology and the team. I believe Devialet is the most disruptive company in the audio business. It is my dream to work with Quentin and their team to change the way people appreciate media of all types. I am very proud and happy to take part in this financing.”
But speakers is not all that Devialet has been building. While the company will continue to expand its brand with its own hardware, it also has plans to embed its tech to work in consumer electronics and other connected devices made by others.
This is where the list of strategic investors will come into play. The plan is to embed Devialet's audio tech in TVs made by Sharp, cars made by Renault, and perhaps do more activities with software-based music services (think Jay-Z's Tidal, which already has a streaming deal with Phantom, or Naver's Line Music), smartphones, and the many more devices that complement and compete with these. If they pull it off, it will democratise Devialet's technology beyond its own high-end, expensive speakers, and make hearing it much more ubiquitous.
“You can find sound in more than 3 billion products sold ever year around the world,” Sannie said. Whether the partners that Devialet is securing with this investment will be the ones that can catapult its technology into more hands will remain to be seen — it will take both successful integrations and then consumers to buy the products. But it is a start.
While we have heard and seen a lot of development in the area of speech recognition and voice interfaces for AI-based personal assistants, audio services have (ironically) been something of a quiet counterpart. If voice interfaces are a big part of the future of how we will interact with our connected devices (indeed, they already are), you can think of what Devialet is developing as the other side of the coin: the aural experience.
The two are, of course, connected. A person will know how to change the tone they or they produce based on what is being heard and sensed: speaking louder in noisy rooms, or more quietly in an emotional or sensitive situation, for example. The same, in a way, could apply to smart audio services.
“Devialet is a tech company. We know a lot about signal processing, but the way we are using it is more today to put the signal out,” Sannie said. “But because of our technology we are able to do the contrary to make something inverse… In an autonomous connected car, the entertainment, the audio experience for the sound, the acoustic even for the silence will be more and more important.
“You will have an electric car producing silence and this should be perfect. We will need more entertainment, but we will also need to deliver safety information and driving information to the driver or person in charge. The acoustic experience will have to be a part of this industry. Because we are able to provide the sound we can also cancel the sound, and because we can cancel the sound we are also able [single out sounds] like a voice and its commands.”
The startup has so far filed 107 patents for its audio codecs, reference designs and other technologies, and it's adding more to that each month, Sannie says.
Other areas where Devialet plans to use some of its investment is to continue building up its retail operation.
Today the company has flagship stores in Paris, London and New York City, and it will be adding more of these into key retail locations. The company also struck a plum deal with Apple in 2015 to sell its Phantom speakers in its retail stores. That retail relationship will continue, as any consumer electronics deals that Devialet may sign with its investors or others are not exclusive.
Sannie got very tight lipped when I asked if Apple is among those that are working with Devialet on any products. It's a logical question: with its acquisition of Beats in 2014 for $3 billion and reported interest in Tidal, Apple has demonstrated that it is also keen to develop high-end audio experiences. For what it's worth, Sannie did note that Apple was aware of the investment as it was being made.
This latest round brings the total raised by Devialet to around $155 million to date, and while Sannie would not disclose Devialet's valuation with this round, we're still trying to find out. (My guess was $300 million; one source says lower.)
While previous investors Bernard Arnault, Jean-Antoine Granjon, Xavier Niel and Marc Simoncini did not participate in this round, they are remaining on the board with this financing. Others joining them are Caroline Giral of CM-CIC Investissement, and Marc Auberger of FFC as observers.
Updated with some additional detail on Tidal relationship.
Last week, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence wrote to the Punjab government calling for action against a senior government official for alleged transactions with a business person accused of smuggling Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret furniture from Chandigarh. It highlights a contrast: such antiques are highly valued by collectors across the world but largely ignored in India. For years, activists in Chandigarh have pointed to the negligence and lack of maintenance that has led to many of Corbusier and Jeanneret's chairs, bookshelves, benches, tables, lamps and other fixtures disappearing from the city and appearing at international auctions, where they routinely fetch high prices.
Chandigarh furniture's lure
Advertising
Leading architect Le Corbusier began designing furniture in 1928, in collaboration with the French architect Charlotte Perriand and, subsequently, their cousin the Swiss architect Pierre Jeanneret. Highly prized by collectors everywhere, these pieces now fetch astronomical prices whenever they appear in auctions. On these grounds alone, the furniture designed by Corbusier and Jeanneret for Chandigarh would have been valuable.
What makes them additionally coveted is their provenance. Even as it was being built, Chandigarh was hailed as Le Corbusier's masterpiece. Most leading collectors thus want a piece of it, and the best way is to acquire one of the many pieces of original furniture designed specifically for the city.
Shanay Jhaveri, editor of the book Chandigarh is in India and assistant curator of South Asian Art at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, says the allure of Chandigarh's furniture lies in the promise the city once held as the future of a newly independent India. “We can go back to Sunil Khilnani's suggestion, made in the Idea of India, that the city of Chandigarh itself never achieved the cosmopolitanism that was hoped for it and rather became — and I quote them — ‘a museum piece in need of protection from its own violently quarreling citizens and ravages of the climate'. These chairs, sofas, desks, tables so carry in them the Utopian promise of mid-20th century modernity and its transnational affiliations which are so absent from our present moment that perhaps it is for these impulses that collectors long after them.”

High prices

Antique dealers, led by Parisian Eric Touchaleaume — who is sometimes referred to as the Indiana Jones of antique furniture and is a recognised expert on Corbusier and Jeanneret's Chandigarh legacy — snapped up much of the furniture during the last 20 years as lack of maintenance coupled with ignorance about its true value led it to being junked or sold for as little as Rs 33 a table. The items bought by international dealers — including Touchaleaume's vast collection — soon began to appear in auction catalogues, with reserve prices running into several thousand dollars. In its Design sale in New York last June, for example, the auction house Bonhams listed the teak ‘Demountable Desk' designed by Jeanneret for Chandigarh's Secretariat for $20,000-30,000. Jeanneret's iconic ‘V-Leg' chairs have found a home in the collections of many enthusiasts, including socialite Kourtney Kardashian who is known to have a dozen of these chairs. A set of eight of these V-Leg chairs were sold in the Bonhams Design auction for $21,250 while a library table fetched $62,500.
The prices that Chandigarh's furniture has fetched at international auctions have caught the attention of many Chandigarh activists who have been lobbying with the government to recognise the value of the city's heritage and stop the sale of these items abroad.
However, the few times that Indian authorities did intervene and tried to stop the auctions from taking place, receipts were produced to show that the furniture had been bought legally. In February 2010, the UT administration tried to stop an auction of Chandigarh furniture by Artcurial of Paris but had to back out when an investigation proved the furniture had been acquired legally.
The following year, Indian authorities attempted to stall the sale of Chandigarh furniture by the American auction house Wright. Wright not only refused to halt the sale but also published a notice that highlighted the Indian authorities' lack of interest in the furniture, which had led to it being sold off as junk in the first place. The notice quoted an official letter from 1986, written by Chandigarh's then chief architect and secretary, architecture, that said, “Sanction is hereby accorded under Rule 10, Schedule VII of the Delegation of Financial Power Rules, to declare the articles of stores as unserviceable and their disposal at public auction.” Wright wrote, “We believe that the Indian government does not have legal rights to these works, particularly given the fact that the Indian government thought these works were ‘junk' and authorized the sale of these works at public auction.”
Law & heritage
Chandigarh's furniture heritage is in a legal twilight zone, in fact, since it is now recognised by everyone — including the authorities — as being valuable, yet remains bereft of any actual protection under Indian law.
Activist Ajay Jagga, an advocate, says they have approached various authorities on the matter, including Chandigarh High Court and the CBI. “I wrote to the Ministry of Culture that since this is a matter of national heritage, they must find some way of declaring this furniture to be ‘art treasures'. That would mean that they can't be sold out of the country,” Jagga said.
They approached the ministry twice on this matter; on both occasions the Archaeological Survey of India, to which the matter was forwarded, declared itself unable to do anything about it. “…These matters are to be dealt under provisions of prevailing legislations of the country,” the ASI wrote in reply to Jagga's last letter, originally sent to the PMO. “As already intimated earlier that the Antiquities and Art Treasures (AAT) Act, 1972 deals with the objects define as antiquities under provisions of the above act. As per the Section 2 of the Act, in addition to the other criteria the object should be in existence for not less than 100 years. Therefore, the artefacts to be declared as antiquity which are less than 100 years old required amendment in existing legislation.”

Jagga says this does not mean the furniture cannot be classified as ‘art treasures'. The AAT Act defines an ‘art treasure' as “..any human work of art, not being an antiquity, declared by the Central Government by notification in the Official Gazette, to be an art treasure for the purposes of this Act having regard to its artistic or aesthetic value”. Besides, says Jagga, “according to Article 49 of the Constitution, it is the duty of the state to protect objects of national importance”.
In a lot of ways George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) is Britain's answer to Paul Ryan. True, he's a toned-down version — no Ayn Rand, please, we're British — but other aspects of package are there in full force: he's articulate, has a vision that's completely at odds with everything we actually know about macroeconomics, and they were for a while the darling not just of the right but of self-proclaimed centrists on both sides of the Atlantic.
Osborne's big idea was that Britain should turn to fiscal austerity now now now, even though the economy remained deeply depressed; it would all work out, they insisted, because the confidence fairy would come to the rescue. Never mind those whining Keynesians who said that premature austerity would send Britain into a double-dip recession.
Strange to say, Britain's recovery stalled soon after Cameron/Osborne began their new policies, and the country is now in a double-dip recession.
So is Cameron rethinking their faith in Osborne? According to the FT, no:
But Mr Osborne continues to enjoy David Cameron's backing and will stay as chancellor when the prime minister this week conducts their reshuffle, expected to take place on Tuesday.
Instead of a real policy rethink, what Cameron and Osborne apparently have in mind is rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic a set of basically minor twiddles involving credit and planning authorizations, which seem highly unlikely to make any significant difference.
Still, there is criticism from within the Tory party — except what the dissidents want is not a return to conventional macro, but “right-wing shock therapy”.
I was particularly struck by this:
Although the chancellor insisted that the economy was “healing” they told the BBC's Andrew Marr there were many obstacles ahead adding: “There is no easy route to a magical recovery.”
That sounds wise and restrained, but it's actually completely wrong-headed. Britain is suffering from lack of demand; it could have a quick (not magical) recovery if policies were taken to stimulate demand. It's the belief that the country can't recover quickly, not the belief that it can, that constitutes economic mysticism.
And the slump — which has now, in Britain, lasted longer than the slump in the 1930s — goes on.
“The way we think, what we experience, and what we do every day is very much a matter of metaphor.”
In their frequently cited book Metaphors we live by, Lakoff and Johnson demonstrate the important role of metaphors in our language, and also in our every day life. They claim that our conceptual system is largely metaphorical, which means that we use metaphors to reason and understand the world.
Conceptual metaphors link a familiar concept with one that is unfamiliar. They help us better understand something that might otherwise be too complex or too abstract for our mind to grasp. Conceptual metaphors make abstract concepts more concrete and therefore bring them within our reach.
Metaphors consist of two parts: a vehicle and a tenor. The vehicle is a concept that we are familiar with. The tenor is the concept to which the metaphor is applied. Because of visual, functional, or structural similarities, we can transfer our knowledge about the vehicle to the tenor and consequently make sense of this unfamiliar concept.
Visual similarities indicate that both the familiar and the unfamiliar concept look alike and can be compared based on external features. Functional similarities are based on common functions or features, unrelated to their appearance. Last but not least, structural similarities are related organizational structures of both the familiar and unfamiliar concept. In any case, existing mental schemata can be applied in order to understand something unfamiliar.
Metaphors on the Web
On the Web, we can make use of metaphors in different ways. In general, conceptual metaphors are a great tool to increase the user experience of your website. However, beware of use metaphors with caution and not overload your page with them. Metaphors that are used consciously can help your users understand abstract content, create a sense of familiarity, trigger emotions, draw attention, or motivate action.
Metaphors on the Web can represent a whole website, or single elements on your site. They can be either interaction or content metaphors and they can be both visual and verbal.
Make the abstract concrete
As described above, conceptual metaphors help us to understand abstract concepts. We refer to familiar schemata in order to make sense of something unfamiliar. Here are several examples of how metaphors are used on the Web to help users make sense of things.
One popular metaphor on websites is tabbed browsing. Different web pages are structured in a way that reminds us of traditional register cards. For example CNN and The Times make use of this metaphor.
The file sharing tool dropbox makes use of a metaphor to help us understand their services. In their name and logo they simply refer to a dropbox, a box that you can drop things into.
Everyone is familiar with a cardboard box to store things. Dropbox has adapted this concept and transferred it to an online tool that stores documents.
Icons are other frequently used examples of metaphors on the Web that help us understand unfamiliar concepts. There are icons for many things, like shopping baskets, home buttons, printers, and many more. For example amazon makes use of a shopping basket that even shows the number of collected items. The amazon wish list is also a metaphor, giving us an instant idea of what it is and what kind of features we can expect of it.
Make the unfamiliar familiar
Through metaphors you can awake a sense of familiarity within your users. Make sure you awake positive associations to increase your users' willingness to get engaged. For example newspapers, like The Times make use of structural similarities people are used to from the paper version.
Another example for familiarity on the Web is the calculator of web2.0.calc. Not only do they offer a calculator with all common functions, they also make it look exactly like a hand calculator.
Make the obvious emotional
With metaphors you can trigger emotions. Link your product with a familiar concept and transfer emotions that come with this concept to your product. For example, the car brand Jaguar places its product in a blurry savanna setting that naturally reminds us of the extremely fast panther, where the Jaguar originally got its name from.
Another example of a metaphor on the Web that makes use of emotions can be found on the homepage of Sparkbox. They use a humorous metaphor to appeal to people and sell their service: websites that adjust to variable screen sizes. They put mobile devices on a tandem to illustrate their mobile nature.
Make the boring salient
Use metaphors to draw people's attention. Keep in mind that visitors are likely to leave your website as fast as they found it. To make sure they stay, you need to grab their attention. Metaphors are a nice and visual way to grab your visitors' attention, even with content that is itself rather boring in nature.
For example, the website of the online retailer dripping in fat presents its organic t-shirts on hangers on a clothesline. With the courser, the visitor can pull the clothesline to both sides to see all products. This metaphor definitely grabs visitors' attention and engages them with the products.
Another, more subtle possibility to catch visitors' attention can be found on the expedition and adventure page of Tanja and Denis Katzer. The big world image in the background already makes the visitor curious. The content area reminds us of an antique letter and promises exciting content.
Make the static actionable
You can use metaphors to engage your users in actions. For example, the gallery Michael Schultz offers an online exhibition experience. Visitors of the site can actually take a tour through the exhibition. This presentation of what we know from a real exhibition is very engaging and actionable.
In sum…
Metaphors can be used to increase your user experience in many ways. Use metaphors to explain complex or unfamiliar concepts, to trigger emotions, and engage your user in actions. Be careful to use metaphors wisely and make sure they work before implementing them in your design. Metaphors are not universal, but they are time and culture sensitive. Test your metaphors to make sure they work for and not against you.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — A Walmart official who focuses on corporate investigations has been nominated for a U.S. attorney post in Arkansas.
President Donald Trump on Friday nominated Duane Kees to serve as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Arkansas.
Kees is currently the director of global ethics and compliance at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. in Bentonville. Born in Little Rock, he's a graduate of the University of Arkansas and the University of Arkansas School of Law. They enlisted in the Army in 2001, where they rose to the rank of captain. They were deployed to Afghanistan for a year and served a 15-month rotation in Iraq.
Sen. John Boozman praised Kees' investigative skills, while Sen. Tom Cotton called them a strong choice. The two senators recommended Kees for the appointment.
Spending, a major Republican priority, gets top billing from Eric Cantor (left). Cantor lays out 22-page game plan
Virginia Republican Eric Cantor's official announcement of their run for House majority leader came with a twist: a 22-page game plan on how to change Congress.
Cantor, currently the GOP whip, began calling colleagues to shore up their support and wrote a letter promising to change Congress – saying they want to “drain the swamp rather than learning to swim with the alligators.”

The document is entitled “Delivering on Our Commitment” and promises a broad range of sweeping initiatives ranging from spending cuts to to bringing each item of the Pledge to America to the floor for a vote. It's a bold plan that shows Cantor wants to be taken as a serious House reformer and policy leader as they ascend to the no. 2 slot in the new GOP hierarchy.
Cantor is not expected to face serious challenge from fellow Republicans for majority leader.
One major reform he's facing is scheduling the House floor, which POLITICO reported last week. Cantor is proposing committee hearings be uninterrupted by votes, and is also urging committee reports to be brought to the floor for debate.
Cantor says they want to do away with legislation recognizing “individuals, groups, events and institutions.” In the past, Congresses in the past have passed legislation that honors entities such as baseball teams and universities. Republicans, the Virginian thinks, should only name post offices once a month.
He's also taking aim at oversight, urging individual members to conduct oversight on their own, asking committees to write quarterly oversight reports and boosting field hearings.
Spending, a major priority of Republicans', also gets top billing from Cantor. They say they will try to ensure that all new spending has “explicitly” listed how it will be paid for and how the legislation fits into the constitution. He's likely going to upset some appropriators, because Cantor re-iterated their plan to end earmarking, promising to “not consider House legislation that includes” the member directed spending.  They are also vowing to defund piece by piece Democratic health care overhaul.
On jobs, Cantor is planning to “conduct an immediate and comprehensive review of existing and proposed government rules and regulations” – echoing a major complaint of Republicans over the last year.
In a throwback to the past, Cantor is aiming to bring rescission bills to the floor under an open rule so members could cut federal spending they deem as wasteful. In addition, they plan to continue the YouCut program – a plan much maligned by Democrats which put spending cuts in the hands of online users. In the beginning of the last Republican majority in 1995, the GOP had internal clashes over spending cuts, especially when members sought to slash items in other Republicans' districts.
Entitlement reform is also in the crosshairs of the Virginia Republican. President Barack Obama, Cantor says, wont work with Republicans to “enact real entitlement reform unless it includes major tax increases.” But Republicans, they said, should lay out their plan and encourage Democrats to do the same.
As President Donald Trump continues taking flak from both sides of the political aisle, active duty military and veterans are coming to the aid of their Commander-in-chief.
By now it's obvious Trump has enemies within the Democrat party and embedded in the Republican establishment, deep state operatives willing to wage a coup against the incoming administration's “America First” agenda.
The full-scale disdain of the president was on display at a Florida VA hospital earlier this week when a portrait of Donald Trump put up by Army veteran and Republican Congressman Brian Mast was taken down by hospital management.
In response to the overwhelmingly negative portrayal of Trump in the dishonest, fake news media, veterans from all walks of life are joining Infowars' initiative to show their support for the president.
Military veterans and active duty service members are encouraged to submit their photos showing their support for the president to: [email protected].

(CBS) Keep your semen to yourself.
That's what world's largest sperm bank is telling potential donors who have red hair. The bank's director told the Danish newspaper Ekstrabladet that there simply wasn't much demand for sperm from red-headed men, the Telegraph reported.
PICTURES - Sperm: 15 crazy things you should know
"I do not think you chose a redhead, unless the partner - for example, the sterile male - has red hair, or because the lone woman has a preference for redheads," Ole Schou, director of Cryos International, told the Danish paper, according to the Telegraph. "And that's perhaps not so many, especially in the latter case."
Cryos, which bills itself as the world's largest network of sperm banks, has strong demand for sperm from red-headed men only from Ireland, according to Schou.
Ten percent of the Irish population has red hair, according to the website of KQED. That's compared to 2 percent to 6 percent of the U.S. population.
Schou said the bank can afford to be picky, according to the Telegraph, because it has a waiting list of 600 guys who are ready to give donation their best shot - and because the bank has reached its capacity of 70 liters of semen.
Men typically ejaculate 2 to 6 milliliters each time, according to WebMD.
What kind of donor are sperm shoppers looking for most? According to Schou, it's guys with brown hair and brown eyes. Dr. Cappy Rothman, medical director of the California Cryobank sperm bank told CBS News that the ideal sperm donor stands six feet tall and has blond or brown hair, blue or green eyes and a "medium" complexion.
Dimples? Dr. Rothman said they're a plus.
The Vermont senator has never hidden their views but their proposed policies to overhaul tuition fees and healthcare have branded them a dangerous extremist
Is the US ready for a socialist president? Sanders might be about to find out
Is the US ready for a socialist president? Sanders might be about to find out
Dr Krissy Haglund does not care if they are labeled a socialist. Or an ideological purist. Or, indeed, any of the other epithets thrown at Americans who are flocking to support Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination. They know what they are: fed up.
On the campaign bus with Bernie Sanders: 'I am moved by the passion' Read more
“I have patients who are deciding not to have children or are unable to buy a house because of their student loans,” says the family physician from Minneapolis, who this week drove four hours with their two children to see the senator speak in Iowa.
“My loan is now $283,000,” they say. “It's gone up $60,000 in the six years since I graduated from medical school. This is a national crisis that needs deep, immediate attention.”
As the only candidate proposing to abolish tuition fees at public universities, Sanders frequently takes on the role of a reverse auctioneer, asking members of the audience at their rallies to shout out how much student debt they have. For a while, the record was $300,000. Then they met a dentist who graduated with loans of $400,000.
But paying for college by taxing Wall Street speculation is not the only policy that has seen the senator from Vermont branded a dangerous extremist – by their own party. Despite the limited health insurance reforms passed by Barack Obama, 29 million Americans remain without any coverage and many more are underinsured to the point where they cannot afford to see a doctor.
So Sanders does the same thing with healthcare, asking audiences to compete to reveal the size of their deductible – the fixed amount per treatment that must be paid by patients before their insurer will contribute anything. At almost every rally someone gets up to $5,000, sometimes in tears.
Their plan to replace this bureaucratic and expensive system by expanding the public Medicare program emulates a “single payer” insurance model used in Canada, rather than the direct state provision of Britain's National Health Service. It aims to reduce overall costs caused by hospitals and drug companies charging the weak US consumer many times the equivalent in other countries that benefit from pooled purchasing power.
Nevertheless, when inevitably someone asks if the US can afford to follow other rich countries down the road of universal healthcare and access to tertiary education, Sanders likes to remind them of the trillions of dollars of income redistribution that has already taken place in the opposite direction: a trend that has left median wages slumping, but 58% of all new income since the banking crash going to the top 1%.
A few years ago you could graduate from high school and get a job and … you'd be able to achieve whatever you wanted Anna Mead, 22, student
“Enough is enough,” audience members typically roar by the time they reach this point in the well-worn speech.
“A few years ago you could graduate from high school and get a job and just work hard, put on those work boots, and you'd be able to achieve whatever you wanted,” agrees Anna Mead, 22, a student from Long Beach, New Jersey, outside a rally in New Hampshire.
“Now, it's just not the case anymore. We've seen vast amounts of inequality just building and building throughout the decades to the extent that the 1% has accumulated such a vast amount of wealth that exceeds 40% of the population. I feel like the United States has always been strengthened whenever we had a president take any kind of policy for the middle class to build them up. When you build everyone up, everyone does better.”
The notion, proposed by Sanders, that a corrupt campaign finance system is the only thing standing between voters and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to change this might seem simplistic. But it is proving wildly popular.
From a standing start, they have closed the gap in the Democratic primary race between themselves and a once unassailable Hillary Clinton, from 36% to just 2%, according to one national poll this week.
Though few believe this one poll to be indicative of the true national picture just yet, real-life voting in the Iowa caucus last week brought Sanders to within 0.3% of Clinton.
In New Hampshire, which votes for a Democratic nominee on Tuesday, Sanders is so far ahead of the former secretary of state in the polls that their advisers would be delighted if they could contain their win to single digits. Many are already dismissing the result as a home turf blip and encouraging Clinton to leave the state on Sunday to focus their time elsewhere.
Locals in New Hampshire bristle, though, at the notion they would be swayed simply because someone is from next-door Vermont, a liberal bastion that the more libertarian iconoclasts in the Granite State regard with suspicion.
This argument also ignores the fact that the state Hillary Clinton represented in Congress is only 50 miles from the New Hampshire border, although New York reportedly has such ambiguous feelings about its former senator that the Sanders camp claims they refused their requests to hold a debate there.
Yet much as it pains their supporters to acknowledge any frailty, Sanders is under growing pressure from Clinton during their debates. The attack strategy varies. Sometimes they argue they are dancing on the head of a pin by debating who is a true progressive, but when the policy gulf is illuminated the attack switches to what they claims are their wildly unrealistic proposals.
Privately, Clinton's attack machine has gone further, claiming deep-seated communist sympathies. That serves as a likely prelude to what Sanders might face from Republicans in the still somewhat unlikely event that they win the Democratic primary.
Sanders has never hidden their political background and has left much for critics to pick over. But it is their steadfast determination not to hide from the label “democratic socialist” that causes most confusion.
I don't know what we mean when we say they are a socialist because my idea of Bernie Sanders is that he's an FDR liberal Sharon Ranzavage, 69, attorney
In a lengthy speech at Georgetown University last November, they argued that their political philosophy was most in keeping with that of Franklin D Roosevelt, who similarly proposed a mix of public works, help for the poor and banking reform to lift America out of the Great Depression.
“I don't know what we mean when we say they are a socialist because my idea of Bernie Sanders is that he's an FDR liberal,” agrees Sharon Ranzavage, 69, an attorney from Flemington, New Jersey, speaking outside an event in Manchester, New Hampshire, on Friday.
“He's back to the future, if you will, and that's why I'm excited about him. I think the Democratic party in this country has veered very far to the right. We have to get back to who we are, which is taking care of each other. We're a capitalist country but we need to modify the extremes of capitalism.”
Confusion also stems from the fact that Sanders uses the phrase “democratic socialist” partly to stress their belief that change must come through the ballot box, but also because, in continental Europe at least, they would probably be known as a social democrat, a label that does not easily translate to the US.
A “Democrat” in US parlance is something the independent senator from Vermont only became when they decided to seek the party's presidential nomination in May. Anyone using the word “social” in American politics might as well go the whole hog and add the “ist” before somewhere else does.
In a British context, Sanders would be hard to place too. Many of their core proposals – universal access to healthcare, paid maternity leave and a more generous minimum wage – are accepted, in principle at least, by all the main UK parties including the Conservatives, who recently put up the British minimum wage as a centerpiece of their budget.

In relative terms, Sanders represents a swing to the left for the Democratic party that is analogous to Jeremy Corbyn's recent victory in the Labour leadership campaign. But on foreign policy and absolute comparisons of domestic policies they would probably be closer to pre-Blairite Labour reformers of the 1980s and 90s such as Neil Kinnock or John Smith.
Back in New Hampshire this week, a radical mood is conjured up at rallies calling for a “political revolution” and blasting out John Lennon's Power to the People. But when Sanders punches their hand into the air, they quickly unclench the fist, to avoid imagery that is too strident.
We will have to wait for several more primary results to know whether American politics could possibly be ready for a self-avowed socialist. Already, the response from supporters to seem to be a shrug that suggests this is the wrong question.
“I feel like I finally have a politician who will match my true feelings and hopes for this country,” says Haglund.
Is America ready for socialism? Probably not. But it might be ready for Sanders.
Sanders fans on socialism
What is wrong with being a socialist?
Dwayne Hamm, 23, from New Brunswick, New Jersey:
I believe what people think is a socialist is: they get confused and think we're heading towards the dreaded communism. But I think people confuse themselves about what it is Sanders is trying to do and what it is a socialist believes in. You'll see that there's nothing wrong. All we're asking for is equality across the board. And to those who have privilege it may seem oppressive. And I feel that's what people think the problem is.

Can you be a democratic socialist?
Anna Mead, 22, from Long Beach, New Jersey:
I don't think socialism can exist properly without democracy. Socialism is community regulation of the means of production and distribution.

How do you feel about Hillary Clinton trying to woo young people?
Fiona Boomer, 19, from Salt Lake City, Utah:
I do have to give credit where credit's due but as a young person Bernie's stance on free education would be amazing. I'm deeply in debt as it is. It would be great if that was free. Hillary is debt free and Bernie is tuition free. That's a big deciding factor for me. I do think Hillary is doing a good job. They claim she's being more realistic but I think Bernie is realistic.

WASHINGTON: US President Barack Obama has proposed to Congress a $3.1 billion in financial assistance to Pakistan for the year 2012.This is part of the administration's ongoing effort towards its continued funding for operations and assistance in key regions of the world -- Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.Of this as many as $1.9 billion in assistance has been proposed to promote a secure, stable, democratic and prosperous Pakistan with a focus on energy, economic growth, agriculture, the delivery of health and education services, and strengthening the Government of Pakistan's capacity to govern effectively and accountably.$1.5 billion of this is part of the Kerry-Lugar-Berman Bill.Another $45 million has been proposed in operations to support infrastructure for maintaining the US government civilian and diplomatic presence and to support educational and cultural exchange programs to build bridges with civil society."We have $350 million in that part of the budget for FMF (Foreign Military Financing) programs, which is part of the five-year agreement that we have made with the government of Pakistan," a State Department official told reporters.In addition to $1.9 billion, Obama has also proposed $1.2 billion to Pakistan under the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Budget.This includes $1.1 billion for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) to provide critical equipment and training for Pakistani security forces, increasing the ability of the Pakistani government to combat insurgents inside that country and eliminating the insurgent's capacity to conduct cross-border operations in Afghanistan that jeopardize US lives and the mission there.In 2010, Pakistan received $79 million under OCO budget, which is estimated to jump to $1.3 billion in 2011."So the unique part of the budget, the extraordinary part of the budget is the PCCF. The enduring part of the budget is more of our economic and military assistance that's going to be sustainable over the long term," they said.An OCO budget is of great help as we transition from military-led to civilian-led operations since it provides a mechanism through which we can view and budget for a transition to a more normal diplomatic presence in these countries when appropriate, the budgetary proposals said.
Gluten-Free Thai Sticky Chicken Fingers are a crunchy, sticky, and irresistible gluten-free appetizer, dinner, or recipe for any occasion. Absolutely addicting!
Capital Duh-eyeing over today's recipe for gluten-free Thai Sticky Chicken Fingers, which are going to be a smash hit at your Super Bowl watching party this weekend (or heck, dinner tonight!)
After learning which teams are going to the Super Bowl this year (and totally guilty of asking Ben for the sole purpose of creating a themed dish for you!) I decided to throw a theme out the window and instead concentrate on creating a dish that you're going to crave until you physically make then sink your teeth into, because that's exactly how I'd describe Thai Sticky Chicken Fingers – craveable!
Chicken breasts sliced into strips are coated in a gluten-free breading that's spiked with sliced almonds for a spectacular taste and crunch that, get this, actually stays on the chicken fingers! How many times have you made homemade chicken fingers or chicken breasts only to have the breading fall right off the dang things after pulling them out of the oven? I'll show you my secret to making sure it stays firmly in place.
After baking, the chicken strips are tossed in a sticky-salty-sweet, Thai-inspired sauce then placed back in the oven for a few minutes to create a fabulous tacky coating. And good tacky. Not like, blatantly cutting someone in line at the fish market, which I've been fuming over for the past four days. COME ON!! Anyway, these chicken fingers are going to knock your socks off. A little sweet, a little heat, and perfectly crunchy and sticky. Grab a wet wipe.
You know what they taste like? My favorite sesame chicken that I used to get at HyVee's Chinese food counter, except these babies are baked, not fried, and gluten-free. Ben and I ate the first batch straight off the baking sheet, trying to pick the recipe apart for improvements. There were hardly any. The combination of sweet chili sauce, gluten-free tamari (or soy sauce,) and lime juice is inherently amazing – no nitpicking needed!
I recently heard that pizza is the #1 food people eat during the Super Bowl but seriously, ditch the grease and make a batch of these bad boys instead. You won't regret it!
Start by pulverizing 1/2 cup sliced almonds in a food processor or chopper until they're mostly crumby, like the picture below, then add to a shallow dish like an 8×8 baking dish.
This recipe is sponsored by Fisher Nuts, whom I've been developing recipes for over the past couple of years. I love using their products because they're high quality and preservative free, and their sliced almonds are especially amazing in the breading for these Thai Sticky Chicken Fingers. I originally made them with just gluten-free bread crumbs but added almonds into the breading mix after Ben suggested it.
They said, and I quote, “You should put almonds in there. They used to do it at Jimmy's (the restaurant they worked at in high school,) and they won awards like, all the time, or whatever.” Love it. Anyway, they were a great addition for not only amping up the Thai-inspired taste, but also giving the chicken fingers a deep, satisfying crunch.
Next, process 4 cups gluten-free Rice Chex to create 2 cups crumbs OR measure out 2 cups panko bread crumbs (dish will not be GF if using panko.) Alternatively, you could add the Rice Chex to a big Ziplock bag then roll over it with a rolling pin until pulverized.
Add the crumbs to the almond crumbs in a shallow dish then season lightly with salt and pepper and set aside.
Next get the chicken ready. As I mentioned, I made my own chicken fingers by slicing 1-3/4lbs chicken breasts into 1″ strips. This is a much more economical way to get chicken fingers vs buying chicken tenderloins which usually cost a couple bucks more.
Toss the chicken strips in a bag with 1/2 cup gluten-free or all-purpose flour (dish will not be gluten-free if using AP flour) plus 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper then shake until well coated.
Working in batches, shake any excess flour from the chicken strips then dunk them in a shallow dish with 2 eggs whisked with 2 Tablespoons milk (any kind – I used unsweetened almond milk) then roll in the crumbs, pressing to make sure they stick to the chicken strips. Place the chicken strips on 2 baking sheets that have been lined with foil and sprayed VERY well with nonstick spray.
Now, this is the important part! Place the baking sheets into the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes to give the breading a chance to adhere to the chicken strips. This is what will prevent it from falling off the chicken fingers once they're baked. Miracle secret revealed!
After the resting period, spray the tops of the chicken strips with nonstick spray or olive oil then bake at 425 degrees for 10 minutes. Flip the strips then spray again, and then place back into the oven, flipping and rotating the baking sheets to ensure even cooking. Bake for 7-9 more minutes or until the chicken fingers are golden brown and cooked through.
Meanwhile, get the sticky Thai sauce cookin'! To a saucepan add 1/2 cup each sweet chili sauce and water, 1/4 cup each brown sugar and gluten-free Tamari or soy sauce, 2 Tablespoons each rice vinegar and lime juice, 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/4 teaspoon red chili pepper flakes, and 1 microplaned or minced garlic clove (and a partridge in a pear tree.) Honestly it sounds like a lot of ingredients but I had 99% of them already on hand. Bring the sauce to a boil then reduce the heat to medium and simmer until slightly thickened and reduced, 5-6 minutes.
Ok I have to show you the sweet chili sauce I used. I found this in the health food section at the grocery store and it is sooooo good! Frank's also has a version but this is the most homemade-tasting sweet chili sauce I've ever had. Definitely not tooth-achingly sweet like some other bottles I've tried!
Pour the sauce into a large bowl then dunk the chicken fingers in using tongs until well coated and place back onto the baking sheet. Bake for 4-5 more minutes, watching carefully to avoid burning, then pull 'em out.
Transfer the chicken fingers to a platter then sprinkle with more sliced almonds and 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, and then feast!

The Crisis in the EU and the Rise of Germany
«This year could be the most difficult of the crisis for Europe», predicts Germany's Foreign Affairs Minister, Guido Westerwelle (1). Amid news from Brussels and a number of other EU countries, this conclusion comes as a surprise to no-one. Reports that European Council President Herman Van Rompuy and High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton declined to remain in their posts for the next term are only aggravating the confused impression being given by Europe's political elite. Horses are not usually changed midstream but if they are, it means they are no longer offering any kind of hope.
The Friedrich Ebert Foundation published the results of a study in which experts from 13 European countries took part (2). In their opinion, there are four likely scenarios for Europe leading up to 2020: maintaining the status quo, permanent crisis; the complete break-up of the Eurozone; differentiation with a separate strong core and periphery, with the periphery rejecting the euro; and a full fiscal union within the current Eurozone. The last scenario is considered to be the most realistic. And it is becoming increasingly evident that Germany's key role in settling problems in the Eurozone is creating a special relationship between Germany and its partners... The authors of the study make no mention of the anti-German feelings of debtor countries, whose populations blame Germany for the adoption of austerity programmes. The study also points out that the EU is becoming aware of Germany's economic power, while at the same time debtor countries have a growing sense of fear, although hidden, when it comes to Berlin.
These kinds of feelings are not just seizing the Eurozone, but the European Union as a whole. Only these fears can explain the efforts of certain Central and Eastern European countries to strengthen bilateral contacts with Germany.
At the end of February, former Commissioner of the European Commission, Günter Verheugen, received an honorary doctorate from Babeş-Bolyai University in Romania for their contribution towards Romania joining the European Union. From 1999-2004, the German politician was Commissioner for Enlargement in the European Commission headed by Romano Prodi. At that time, Verheugen was the first to name a deadline for Romania's entry into the EU – 2007. And so it happened; 12 years after officially applying to join, Romania and Bulgaria were accepted into the EU.
Speaking at an awards ceremony in February, Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta called the German politician the founding father of the idea of a European Romania. The evaluation was designed to be heard in Berlin. At the beginning of the 1990s, a united Germany was energetically carrying out a strategic course of action to expand the European Union to the east, which in spirit was a response to the age-old tradition of Drang nach Osten. Verheugen, along with other German politicians, worked within the framework of this course of action. The treaty on the accession of six Central and Eastern European countries to the EU, including Romania, was adopted at a session of the Council of the European Union in the German city of Essen in 1994.
It is hardly accidental that the former German politician received their honorary doctorate from a university in Cluj-Napoca – a city in the historical region of Transylvania founded by German merchants; in German it is known as Klausenburg. The city was included in the territories transferred to Hungary as part of the second Vienna Award (1940), and from 1944-1945, during the German occupation of Hungary, it was under the direct control of Berlin. Today, teaching at the university is conducted in Romanian, Hungarian and German. The dispute between Romania and Hungary over this territory has been formally eliminated, otherwise neither country would have been accepted into the EU, but in practice the situation regarding the Hungarian minority is one of the most sensitive domestic policy topics in Romania and acts as a source of friction between Romania and Hungary which escalated after the self-determination of Székely Land in 2009 (the Székelys are a Hungarian minority group).
In contrast, Germany's policy regarding ethnic Germans is not proving unpopular with the Romanian authorities. During the latest session of the German-Romanian government commission (an annual event which takes place alternately in Germany and Romania), the commission's co-chair, German Deputy Interior Minister Christoph Bergner, declared, among other things: «Both the German and Romanian sides recognise that in the interests of the whole of Europe, it is extremely important to give support to the German minority, strengthening their identity and viability» (3). This support has a cash equivalent. In 2013, the German Ministry of Internal Affairs allocated 1.7 million euros and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs – 0.4 million euros, while Romania allocated 1.45 million euros (4). At present in Romania, additional payments to ethnic Germans (the overall size of the diaspora is nearly 40,000 people) exceed the size of the country's minimum pension.
Another example of the Romanian authorities' dalliances with influential Germany has been the nomination of Klaus Johannis, who for many years headed the Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania, for the post of First Deputy Chairman of the National Conservative Party. The most surprising aspect of this appointment is the departure from regulation which in cases like these requires a certain length of service in the party that Johannis could not possibly have, as they only appeared in the party four days before their appointment.
So in order to strengthen links with Germany, the Romanians are actively making use of the German ethnic minority's presence in their country. In this regard, the Hungarians have gone even further. From 2013 onwards, the Hungarian parliament has decided that 19 January will be celebrated as a day of remembrance for Germans expelled from Hungary. According to German historians, at least half a million Germans living in Hungary were deported after the Second World War; the overall number of people deported is estimated to be 14 million. Budapest officially apologised for the expulsion of Germans back in 1995. In 2007, the Hungarian parliament held a conference dedicated to the memory of those expelled. That same year, the parliament unanimously voted to establish a day of remembrance and a high-ranking guest from Germany spoke at a special session for the occasion – Bundestag President Norman Lammert. In their speech, they called the Hungarian parliament's decision «an impressive gesture promoting reconciliation and understanding». Angela Merkel also spoke approvingly of this «impressive gesture» when they received Hungarian President Janos Ader in Berlin.
Note that Germany itself does not yet have such a day of remembrance. While in opposition, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU)/Christian Socialist Union (CSU) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) pushed a resolution through the Bundestag in 2003 on the establishment of a day of remembrance and, in 2011, the Bundestag was obliged to consider the possibility of introducing one, but a decision has still not been made. At present, a number of CDU and CSU land offices are suggesting that a day of remembrance be held for victims of the expulsion, while the head of the CSU, Horst Seehofer, is demanding that compensation be paid to Germans who ended up doing forced labour in camps in the USSR, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania after the end of the Second World War. According to Erika Steinbach, head of the German Union of Expellees, in 2012 there were 40,000 people living in Germany who would have been entitled to this compensation. Germany's parliamentary parties are in dispute over the choice of date for this remembrance day, but there is certainly no disagreement among German politicians that such a national day of remembrance should be established.

Sunday's Lineup
(show listed to start at 4pm; they were a half hour late and did a half hour of opening ceremonies tonight; maybe it won't be as long the second time, but there's no way it's actually starting at 4.)
Team Canada faces Team USA in the women's third place match
Team Mexico faces Team Japan in the women's first place match
Team Japan/Zero One/Oudou, Team Rest of the World, Team Mexico/Leyendas and Team USA/TNA will compete in a special four team battle royal. One member of each team will be in the ring at a time, and the next member of the team will replace them when they're eliminated. Once they're down to two people total left, those two men will face off in a one fall match for a trophy.
They're clear if they order the men's matches tonight line up up with the brackets for tomorrow. If they are the same, it would be
Team Mexico/AAA faces Team Japan/NOAH
Team Mexico/International faces Team USA/LU
A men's third place game
A men's first place game
Thoughts
This was the amusing event is appeared to be on paper. I laughed, I was entertained, I flooded your Twitter (and I'm really sorry about that.) This was not a show with a lot of great matches – the Team Japan vs Team AAA match is the only one I'd strongly recommend seeking out – but it was the weird bit of mixing people in unusual fashion with not a lot of idea of going on. Maybe I'll make some popcorn before Sunday's show to better go with the atmosphere.
There were no big surprises in outcomes. Konnan posted what they said were spoilers early in the show (during the show, so it's not like they cost AAA any business, they just potentially hurt the show for those people who bought it), but everyone match finished the way most people would've guessed when they finally announced the matchups a couple hours earlier. All of them really made sense. For me, the toughest call was Team Canada losing to Team Japan, since Taya's the only one of the six who's going to be around after this weekend. For them, it appeared the toughest call was having the TNA team lose, since they appeared to be the promotion working strongest with AAA in this (at least among those they don't part own.) That was reflected in the booking, where Tyrus got a visual pinfall over Dragon Azteca before taking the loss. Team TNA is the obvious favorite to win the hastily announced competition for the losers, though I'm not sure how they're going to beat Akebono in that.
They also shortened the time limits to 10 minutes, from 15 last year. I didn't like the sound of that at first, but the show went 3 hours with 6 matches under that format and we'd still be watching if they did 15. They should've held back on the overtime bits tonight as it was, since given they'll want to do them all again on Sunday. It also seemed like they tried at least twice for pinfalls to happen just as the time ran out, only they were running 10 seconds ahead of the clock. Luckily everyone kicked out.
Notable that Tirantes and Piero (along with the same NOAH & LU referees as last year) were on the show. I did not see Copetes, who did this show instead of Hijo del Tirantes last year.
The two most over matches of the night seemed like the Mex AAA/Japan Other match and the Mex International/TNA. It's good there are three Mexico men's teams, because the crowds aren't in the foreigners (they don't know) versus foreigner (they don't know) matches, and the quietness carried over into the Leyendas match. Fans took the overtime in the AAA Mexico match, though it seemed to run out of steam with Hideo & Texano. Tyrus wasn't much good (and gave off the impression they didn't care about being there much), but he's big and so they built the finish around him. Dragon Azteca getting the big pinfall should lead to something – Octagon Jr.'s spot is vacant – but you never know with AAA.
Meanwhile, Mil Muertes performance was unmemorable. There was no obvious reason why they were using that character. Dario did a fun heel promo before their team's match, but (if it was possible), they would've been better off bringing Catrina to make Mil come off like they meant something.
The two women's matches were kind of all over the place, but fine for openers. Team Japan was all built for Aja Kong spots. Natsu got beat up most of the match (and wasn't impressive selling) and Yuki seemed to barely be in the match. The Canadian team didn't look great, but it wasn't a match made for them to look great. Their match against Team USA sounds more interesting. The opener was frantic, all over the place and the shortest match of the night. The crowd dug it because it was the Apaches, but it needed more time to settle down.
Photos showed there were a couple of sets not filled. You could occasionally spot them on TV, but mostly it was a dark room where it was hard to see far in the arena. (No idea on the bleachers.) The crowd was loud at times, but it didn't feel well miced. It's a convention center they cut off in half via curtain, there are limitations in that. Production was iffy; they couldn't get the countdown clock on the screen early and we got shots of the big screen instead. They missed Texano's winning pin while going to a long shot, making it feel underwhelming (even more so than it did from ending a move they never uses to win.) The set looked great, opening in the middle for each team to debut. The opening ceremony was nice, but would've been better appreciated has AAA just announced they were starting at 9 so there wasn't a half hour of waiting & stress to find out if the iPPV was even going to work.
(It looks like Josh did mention the show was starting at 9 on their Twitter. There's no time on the iPPV site, and the only time listed on the main website was 8:30.)
Hugo mentioned that TripleMania would take place in August – which I know is obvious, but is the first time they've actually said that so far this year. Josh and Hugo were hinting there'd be TNA wrestlers on TripleMania. I don't think they'd mean much, but we've seen AAA bring in foreign wrestlers for TripleMania many years just to make some point about being international, so it seems likely to happen unless something changes with TNA. There was no mention about Verano de Escandalo in two weeks, but handful of plugs for Slammiversary during the show. It only got overbearing a couple times, and once it was Hugo drawing Josh into a conversation about Bram versus Eli Drake. Hugo was being a super team player, trying to put everyone over, and it was a bit too much at times.
Josh was mostly fine in the first half of the show, doing well enough at identifying people and giving background that it seemed like they had done a lot of preparation. And then they identified La Parka as the chairperson from WCW and it appeared they had not done nearly enough. Neither they nor Hugo appear to be fans of Season 2 of Lucha Underground, because they spent the main event calling one of the guys “Aztec Dragon” for no explained reason; someone gave them bad notes. They must've given them to Melissa as well, as that's what they announced, but they should've known better. (It'll be telling if they don't correct that on Sunday.) Overall, I like Josh better than Striker, because Josh avoids Matt's tendencies to be too clever for their own good, but they were just fine here. I suspect, if TNA will be back for TripleMania, he'll be back doing English announcing as well.
Sunday's show should be entertaining. I don't know if it's $25 worth alone, and I don't know if Friday's show will hold up to rewatching at all. But I enjoyed it while it was on.

A British general kept Winston Churchill and Free French leader Charles De Gaulle in the dark about a top secret 1942 plan to arm Vichy France, recently discovered documents reveal.
Both Churchill and De Gaulle had made clear their contempt for Marshall Petain's regime, which controlled a large part of France thanks to a deal struck with Hitler.
Relations between Britain and France had been strained since July 1940, when Churchill, who was determined to stop French ships falling into German hands, ordered the Royal Navy to sink several French war ships off the coast of Algeria - 1,300 French sailors lost their lives in the action.
In retaliation, a furious Vichy not only broke off diplomatic relations with London but also bombed Gibraltar.
In December 1941, Winston Churchill made clear their distaste for the supposedly neutral Vichy regime and its often enthusiastic collaboration with Hitler.
Here we were having been fighting the Vichy French... and here we are talking about arming their colleagues Professor Eric Grove, University of Salford
"The men of Vichy, they lay prostrate at the foot of the conqueror, they fawned upon him," they said, in a speech to the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa.
Later, Vichy voluntarily deported Jews to Germany.
Charles De Gaulle was equally contemptuous. Vichy's leaders had accused them of being a traitor when they fled to London after the fall of France. At the time, Marshal Petain, a hero of World War I, was a more popular figure in France - many saw them as having shielded Vichy from the worst excesses of Hitler's forces and saved the region from German occupation.
But neither man had anything to say about a secret meeting in London in December 1941 between a senior Vichy military officer and a member of the British General Staff. That, it seems, is because nobody told them.
But documents dated six months later show that the meeting resulted in a decision that was both extremely significant and highly controversial.
Image caption General Alan Brooke's Most Secret memo of May 1942: "Plan to give support to the French Army in occupied territory"
A proposal discussed at the meeting was approved in May 1942 by General Alan Brooke, Chief of the Imperial General Staff. Under the top secret plan Britain was to arm Vichy troops and link up with them in an Allied landing at Bordeaux and La Rochelle. At the time Britain had no official military links with Vichy and its forces were fighting Petain's troops in Madagascar.
Professor Eric Grove of the University of Salford, who discovered the papers, says they were astonished at what they found.
Image caption Alan Brooke (right) took a risk by keeping Churchill out of the loop
"My eyes widened," they say.
"Here we were having been fighting the Vichy French in Syria in 1941 and, indeed, in May 1942 we were actually fighting Vichy forces in Madagascar. And here we are talking about arming their colleagues in France itself."
What is even more shocking, in Grove's view, is the high-level backing the plan had, and not only in Britain.
"This plan has the support of the French Chief of the General Staff and General Weygand, who was a French general with a very high reputation significant support. They wanted us to arm eight French divisions to take part in the liberation of France," they say.
World War II historian Max Hastings believes that Winston Churchill, the undisputed leader of Britain's war effort, would not have taken kindly to being kept in the dark about a plan of this magnitude.

Particularly when one of those involved in it was General Alan Brooke, the man at the very top of Britain's military machine.
"There's no doubt that one of the most fascinating aspects of this document is that the Chiefs of Staff commit to paper the fact that it's not to be mentioned to the prime minister," says Hastings.
"If he'd known what they said Brooke would have had a very, very bad half hour indeed with the prime minister, because Churchill liked to know everything."
It seems likely that both Churchill and De Gaulle were not told because of fears about what would happen if they knew.
Image caption Marshal Petain (left) and Adolf Hitler (right) in 1940
In Max Hastings' view, Churchill, "a man of passionate impulses", could have viewed the plan as iniquitous or as an opportunity.
According to Jean-Louis Cremieux-Brilhac, a senior intelligence officer with the Free French in London in 1942, De Gaulle's reaction was all too predictable.
"If we had known, it would have been something scandalous for us," they say.
But when American forces landed in Vichy-occupied North Africa in November 1942, the secret plan - which seemed to have been dropped quietly anyway - was well and truly dead.
The lack of Vichy resistance to Allied forces prompted the Germans to invade unoccupied France, and Marshal Petain's regime could no longer do deals with anyone.
But French historian and author Henry Rousso says these formerly secret papers make clear what might have happened had Vichy's General Giraud, and not General De Gaulle, taken over French forces in North Africa in 1943.
"It could have been possible that De Gaulle didn't win this political fight, and the history of France would have been, after the war, completely different. And this document reminds historians to be very cautious about the way we are writing history."

R&B singer Chris Brown was arrested on Friday in Malibu, California, on a warrant issued for a probation violation related to their 2009 assault of then-girlfriend Rihanna, the Los Angeles County Sheriff said.
Singer Chris Brown has been arrested for a probation violation related to a 2009 case for "assault with a deadly weapon and criminal threats".
Brown, 24, who is pictured here in a hearing in December last year, is being held without bail in Los Angeles after being taken into custody, according to LA County deputy sheriff Amber Smith.
They said: "Los Angeles County sheriffs from the Malibu, Lost Hills station arrested Chris Brown at a location that they were staying at in the city of Malibu fora warrant that was issued for a probation violation.
The Wolfowitz Doctrine and the document A Clean Break, set out contemporary US policy against Russia, China and the Middle East dating back to the 1990s. These documents, while still influential in Washington, have been abject failures on many fronts.
In the 1990s, US officials, all of whom would go on to serve in the George W. Bush White House, authored two short, but deeply important policy documents that have subsequently been the guiding force behind every major US foreign policy decision taken since the year 2000 and particularly since 9/11.
These documents include the Defense Planning Guidance for the 1994–99 fiscal years (more commonly known as the Wolfowitz Doctrine). This document, as the name implies was authored by George W. Bush's deeply influential Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz as well as I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, who served as an advisor to former US Vice President Dick Cheney.
The other major document, A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, from 1996 was authored by former Chairman of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee in the administration of George W. Bush, Richard Norman Perle.
Both documents provide a simplistic but highly unambiguous blueprint for US foreign police in the Middle East, Russia's near abroad and East Asia. The contents of the Wolfowitz Doctrine were first published by the New York Times in 1992 after they were leaked to the media. Shortly thereafter, many of the specific threats made in the document were re-written using broader language. In this sense, when comparing the official version with the leaked version, it reads in the manner of the proverbial ‘what I said versus what I meant' adage.
By contrast, A Clean Break was written in 1996 as a kind of gift to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who apparently was not impressed with the document at the time. In spite of this, the US has implemented many of the recommendations in the document in spite of who was/is in power in Tel Aviv.
While many of the recommendations in both documents have indeed been implemented, their overall success rate has been staggeringly bad.
Below are major points from the documents followed by an assessment of their success or failure.
1. Regime change against Saddam Hussein's Iraq (A Clean Break)
This objective is in many ways both the clearest initial success and also the most strident overall failure.
In 1996, Richard Perle suggested that removing Saddam Hussein from power would be good for the US and Israeli interest because it would weaken a powerful, large Arab state that had poor relations with the US since 1990 and historically poor relations with multiple regimes in Tel Aviv. While Iraq's President was removed from power by illegal force in 2003, that which happened subsequently, did not deliver the outcome Perle had desired.
A Clean Break suggests that a post-Saddam Iraq could and should be ruled by a restored Hashemite dynasty, which was originally overthrown in 1958. Perle continues to suggest that Jordan, the last remaining Hashemite state in the Arab world, could work with Israel and the US to make this happen. Even more absurdly, Perle suggests that a Hashemite would-be union between Jordan and Iraq would be able to command more loyalty from Hezbollah supporters in Lebanon than Iran.
The realities could not be more different. After the illegal 2003 invasion of Iraq, the idea of restoring the Hashemite dynasty was never again floated in any serious forum, as the idea would be simply impossible to implement. There was no will among any major faction in Iraq to restore a monarchy that was overthrown in a revolution in 1958 that many Iraqis continue to look back on with national pride.
Ironically, the biggest Arab bulwark against a resurgent Iran was Saddam Hussein. In the 1980s, the future neo-cons realised this, though they seemingly ignored what they once knew, as early as in 1992.
Since Saddam Hussein's removal from power and violent execution, Iraq's majority Shi'a population have generally rallied around Iran politically, militarily and spiritually. Iraq has recently signed a defensive military pact with Iran and it is well known that many of the Shi'a volunteer brigades which are fighting ISIS in Iraq have received training and advice from Iranian experts.
While the US bases in Iraq make a US military presence closer to Iran than it was prior to 2003, by the same token Iran's influence in the Arab world, especially in Iraq has grown substantially. In any case, the desired illegal ‘regime change' war against Iran will likely never happen for two reasons. First of all, many in the Pentagon and in Washington moreover, realise that such a war would be an unmitigated disaster for the US and secondly, Iran has many influential international partners that it did not have in the 1990s, primarily Russia. Russia as well as China would not stand for a war on Iran in 2017.
In this sense, the US got very little of what it claimed it wanted in overthrowing Saddam apart from the weakening of a united Iraq.
2. ‘Containing' Russia and China by preventing them from becoming superpowers (Wolfowitz Doctrine)
This policy has failed on every front. Since the rise of George W. Bush, the first White House adherent to the Wolfowitz Doctrine, Russia and China have risen to a status which means that there are three global superpowers, not the lone American superpower dreamt of by Wolfowitz and Libby.
China's economic rise has fuelled a more robust stance from Beijing on global affairs. China now vigorously defends its claims in the South China Sea, has continually outflanked the US on the Korean issue, is engaged in the building of One Belt–One Road, the most wide reaching trade and commerce initiative in modern history and has opened its first military base overseas.
At the same time, the People's Liberation Army continues its modernisation programme, making it as formidable a force which for all practical purposes, is as battle ready and capable as those of the US and Russia, countries which during the Cold War, had far superior armed forces to China.
Likewise, Russia's return to superpower status, has been equally crushing in respect of the goals of Wolfowitz and Libby. Russia has not only strengthened old alliances but is now an important ally or partner to countries which were former Cold War opponents or otherwise non-aligned countries. This is true in respect of Russia's alliances and partnerships with China, Pakistan, Turkey, Iran, Philippines and increasingly Indonesia. Russia is also becoming ever closer to South Korea and even Japan.
With Russia's military now boasting modern defence systems which can rival those of the US and in many cases are objectively superior to those of the US, the idea that the US would prevent Russia from re-attaining super-power status and China emerging as a super-power has become a patent absurdity.
3. Containing Syria via Turkey and Jordan (A Clean Break)
For a while, this plan was implemented with some degree of success by the Obama administration. While Jordan never played a substantial part in the proxy wars on Syria, apart from being a NATO transport corridor, Turkey did help to undermine Syria's sovereignty with its armed forces and its own proxies.
While relations between Turkey and Syria remain poor, relations between Turkey and the rest of its NATO ‘allies' is also poor.
Turkey has quietly ceased its support for terrorist groups (aka the opposition) in Syria, is participating in the Astana Peace Process with long time Syrian allies Russia and Iran and is engaged in multiple trading and commercial deals with Russia, including the purchase of the Russian made S-400 missile defence system.
The overall result of Turkey's participation in the Syrian conflict has been a strengthening of Turkey's relationship with historical adversaries, Russia and Iran, something which has happened simultaneously to Turkey's essentially dead relationship with the EU and its incredibly weakened relationship with the US.
All the while, Ba'athist Syria has emerged from the conflict victorious with its commitment to the Palestinian cause as strong as ever.
Far from being “contained”, Syria is now more admired throughout the wider world than at any time in the last three decades.
4. Molesting Russia's borderlands (Wolfowitz Doctrine)
In the original text of the Wolfowitz Doctrine, there was a provision stating that the US must work to make sure that places like Ukraine and Belarus became part of the US economic and geo-political orbit, maintaining both “market economies” and “democracies”.
The 2014 US engineered coup against the legitimate government in Kiev was a knee-jerk US response to the fact that Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych rejected an economic association agreement with the EU, under the guise that the Ukrainian economy cannot afford to cut itself off from Russia.
Yanukovych was subsequently overthrown in a violent coup, and a neo-fascist pro-western regime was installed. However, this can hardly be considered a success as the sheer violence and incompetence of the current Kiev regime has made it so that Ukraine, a place whose borders were always dubious to begin with, will almost inevitably fracture into something unrecognisable.
Already, much of Donbass has been incorporated into the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics that will never go back to Kiev rule and Crimea, whose relationship with Kiev was even more tenuous is now happily reunited with the rest of the Russian Federation.
Seeing the coup in Kiev, Belorussian President Alexander Lukashenko has pledged to crack down on any would be trouble-makers, all while remaining a committed albeit tantrum prone ally of Russia.
The only part of this element of the Wolfowitz Doctrine which has not been a failure has been the weaponisation of eastern Europe. The reason this has succeeded is due to the fact that Russia has no interest in invading eastern Europe. Russia has merely responded by building up its defences against NATO's provocative weaponisation of Poland and the Baltic States.
5. Weakening Hezbollah (A Clean Break)
In 2017, Hezbollah is not only more popular than ever, but is militarily might is stronger than at any time in its history. Hezbollah's role in fighting terrorism in Syria has won the party praise from groups in Lebanon that previously were never keen on Hezbollah, as well as individuals in the wider world who seek to build a genuine anti-terrorist coalition.
The conflict in Syria has drawn Iran, Iraq, Syria and southern Lebanon (the heartland of Hezbollah) closer together than they have ever been. This has in many ways been a result of the common cause of fighting groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda that bound them all together.
In 2006, Hezbollah dealt Israeli forces a major defeat in South Lebanon. Today, Hezbollah is even stronger and everyone in Israel is all too aware of this.
This was a major failure in respect of implementing the ‘destruction' of Hezbollah advocated by Richard Perle.
6. North Korea not to be allowed nuclear weapons (Wolfowitz Doctrine)
The fact that North Korea just tested what is widely believed to be a hydrogen bomb, is a clear indication that this major goal of Wolfowitz and Libby has failed.
Beyond this, while Russia has condemned both North Korea and US led provocative acts on the Korean peninsula, Russian President Vladimir Putin has acknowledged that North Korea does have the right to self-defence, something which has become even more prescient after North Korea witnessed the destruction of Iraq and Libya which did not have weapons capable of deterring a US invasion.
Russia and China have clearly seized the initiative on the Korean issue. Apart from launching a disastrous war on North Korea, the US can now do little to change the realities in Pyongyang.
CONCLUSION:
The aggregate effect of this analysis indicates that the US is still highly capable of starting wars and igniting conflicts throughout the world, but that it is likewise hardly ever capable of winning these conflicts or even achieving a majority of its own stated goals.
As the two most revealing foreign policy documents from the US in the post-Cold War era, both the Wolfowitz Doctrine and A Clean Break have been abject failures. In many cases, in attempting to achieve the goals of these documents, the United States has ended up achieving the opposite.
The US is militarily strong, but strategically, diplomatically and geo-politically, it is actually close to impotent.

Gameweek 23 Clean Sheet Probability & Expected Goals
Gameweek 23 Clean Sheet Probability & Expected Goals.
The purpose of this article is to help you identify the Premier League teams with the best clean sheet and goal scoring potential for Gameweek 23.
Both of these factors are essential for FPL (or any fantasy football game) as your fortunes and point totals are hugely dependent on goals scored and clean sheets secured.
Algorithm provided by our partners: All Fantasy Tips
Write-up by: NaturalFootyFan
How to use these numbers
These numbers are based on a statistical model where each team has a unique rating for scoring and conceding goals. This rating is based on various factors from the previous 10-50 Premier League matches, and it is updated on regular basis.
Making use of these numbers can give you a huge advantage in many ways:
Gain an edge by identifying the favourites and most likely scorers, compare the clean sheet potential of lower-tier clubs such as West Brom, Bournemouth and Stoke or solidify your initial gut picks with statistical findings.
Gameweek 23 Top Candidates
Clean sheet: Man Utd 65%, Tottenham 49%, Arsenal 47%
Expected goals: Arsenal 2.88, Man Utd 2.31, Tottenham 2.02
Last round we named Chelsea as the “clean sheet banker of the week” and they did not disappoint. Antonio Conte's mix of attacking flair in the first half, followed by a stubborn defensive display in the second half was expertly executed as their side defeated Hull City by two goals to nil.
This gameweek it's Man United who host The Tigers. Mourinho's men possess an immense 65% clean sheet probability, despite having failed to secure a shutout in their last three attempts at Old Trafford. Fatigue could also come into play, as United face Hull in the EFL Cup semi-final on Thursday and Wigan in the FA Cup on Saturday.
We advise that you don't make your Fantasy Football transfers too early. It's worth waiting to see how these games pan out, as the last thing you want is the headache of a transferring in an injured player.
Tottenham the next best candidates. Although they have been plagued by injury in recent weeks, with Vertonghen ruled out long-term and Alderweireld's hamstring worries, they should still be able to limit a struggling Sunderland side to few chances. Spurs have kept three clean sheets in their last four matches in all competitions.
Taking injuries into account, Kevin Wimmer (4.6m) is an interesting option in FPL. They stepped in for Vertonghen in flawless fashion at this stage last season and is expected to do so once again. It's not yet clear, but Pochettino might return to four at the back. If this is the case, FPL favourites Walker and Rose (also a doubt with injury) will play a slightly more withdrawn role.
Another encounter to keep note of is the clash between Middlesbrough and West Brom. Boro are new on the block, but their manager has already been labeled the ‘new Mourinho' with their defensive approach, while West Brom have been clean sheet favourites ever since Tony Pulis arrived.
We recommended The Baggies last gameweek and the legendary pairing of Chris Brunt and Gareth McAuley paid back massively with their attacking returns. The former grabbed a goal, with a fantastically struck effort, while the latter chipped in with an assist and maximum bonus points.
Liverpool have dominated the attacking category this season. It's rare that they don't feature in our top three, but it's understandable as Jurgen Klopp and their troops take on league leaders Chelsea. This obviously reduces their expected goals a fair amount.
Arsenal tops the bunch in terms of goal-scoring potential, so Alexis Sanchez is once again the first choice captain pick for those who trust the numbers… and probably for many non-believers as well! They host a Watford side who have conceded two goals or more in six of the previous nine league matches.
Manchester United are rarely among the top scoring candidates, however, their weak opponent makes their frontline viable. We expect it to become a head-to-head battle between Ibrahimovic and Sanchez for the most popular FPL captain in this midweek gameweek, with both players expected to rack up big points.
One thing to remember is that Sanchez, being listed as a midfielder, banks an extra point for every goal and can also nick another point if their side don't concede; Arsenal are ranked third in our clean sheet algorithm.
Tottenham come third with a favourable fixture against Sunderland. Louis Van Gaal's ‘twitchy ass' comment has never been more suitable to describe David Moyes, as they wait for Alli, Kane and Eriksen to run riot on their backline.
The past performance:
Here you can see how the top candidates of this algorithm have performed in the previous weeks. As you can see, the numbers can predict the outcomes pretty nicely!
Clean Sheet Accuracy (Top Candidates): 63%
Goals Scored Per Match (Top Candidates): 2.52
Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
Anthony has posted on a recent study (behind a paywall) of rice production in Rice yields, CO2 and temperature – you write the article. The article claims that rice yields are falling, and will fall further, due to temperature changes.
I said I'd write the article if someone would send me the actual study, and a couple of WUWT readers came through, my thanks to them. Here's my take on what the authors have done.
First, the good. They have used actual data from farmer's fields, rather than theoretical data or greenhouse experiments.
Figure 1. Rice Fields in Ha Giang
However, there are some troubling things in the study.
First, it covers a very short time span. The longest farm yield datasets used are only six years long (1994-99). Almost a fifth of the datasets are three years or less, and the Chinese data (6% of the total data) only cover two years (1998-1999).
Now, if they were comparing the datasets to temperature records for the area where the farms are located, we could get useful information from even a two-year dataset. But they are not doing that. Instead, they say:
Data series from the weather stations at the sites were too short to determine trends. Instead, trends in Tmin and Tmax were based on a global analysis of ground-station data for 1979–2004 …
Unfortunately, they have neglected to say which “global analysis of ground-station data” they are using.
But whichever dataset they used, they are comparing a two year series of yields against a twenty-six year trend. I'm sorry, but I don't care what the results of that comparison might be. There is no way to compare a two-year dataset with anything but the temperature records from that area for those two years. This is especially true given the known problems with the ground-station data. And it is doubly true when one of the two years (1998) is a year with a large El Niño.
For example, they give the trend for maximum temps in the winter (DecJanFeb) for the particular location in China (29.5N, 119.47E) as being 0.06°C per year, and the trend for spring (MarAprMay) as being 0.05°C per year (I get 0.05°/yr and 0.04°C/yr respectively, fairly close).
But from 1998 to 1999, the actual DJF change was +2.0°C, and the MAM change was minus 1.0°C (CRU TS Max Temperature dataset). As a result, they are comparing the Chinese results to a theoretical trend which has absolutely no relationship to what actually occurred on the ground.
To try to find out which “ground-station data” they used, I compared their temperatures for China (29.5N, 119.47E) with the CRUTEM3, CRU TS, and GISS records from KNMI. However, I could not match their numbers, although I could get sorta close. Worrisome.
Next, they have not mentioned autocorrelation anywhere in their study. This makes me think that they have not adjusted for autocorrelation, which is particularly important with short datasets.
Next, they base their predictions for the future on a single computer model of the regional changes. It is widely agreed that computer climate models are not very good at predicting regional changes, so that part of their study seems very weak.
I am most mystified by their use of the 26-year temperature trend. Why not use the actual year-by-year changes in the local temperature? The rice is responding to actual temperatures, not to a mathematical trend … so why not compare yields to actual temperatures?
So once again, we have questionable methods used with uncited data to give alarming results. It is too bad, because their premise is good, and so is their general approach (use actual farm data).
Color me unimpressed …

A defiant President Trump said Sunday afternoon that the outrage over NFL players kneeling during the national anthem "has nothing to do with race," but rather is about "respect for our country."
Speaking on the tarmac in New Jersey before boarding Air Force One, Trump doubled down on their comments about the NFL and its players.
"This has nothing to do with race. I never said anything about race," Trump said. "This has to do with respect for our country and respect for our flag."
When asked if players who kneeled today should be fired as they suggested earlier, the president said, "I think the owners should do something about it. It's very disrespectful to our flag and our country."
Trump, however, noted that they "watched a little bit" of Sunday's football games, and said, "there was tremendous solidarity for our flag and for our country."
Top Trump administration officials defended the president's comments over the weekend.
"I think what the president is saying is that the owners should have a rule that players should have to stand in respect for the national anthem," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told ABC News' "This Week." "This isn't about Democrats. It's not about Republicans. It's not about race. It's not about free speech. They can do free speech on their own time.”
Trump touched off a firestorm Friday night at a political rally in Alabama when they said: "Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a b---- off the field right now.'"
NFL owners and league Commissioner Roger Goodell were among the first to disagree with Trump's remarks.
But by Sunday, the overwhelming response by players was of full display, with many kneeling or locking arms during the playing of the anthem. Three teams chose to stay in their locker rooms.
On "Fox News Sunday," Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, argued that players indeed have a First Amendment right to kneel, "but NFL owners also have the right to fire those players."
And they said they didn't think Trump had "re-opened racial wounds."
Short also appeared to defend Trump for tweeting Saturday that he'd rescinded Golden State Warrior Stephen Curry's invitation to a White House event honoring their team's 2017 NBA championship, after Curry suggested a day earlier that they wouldn't go.
"He's the one who injected politics into the invitation to come to the White House," Short said. "That is what the president is reacting to. The president said fine, don't come."
Short and Mnuchin each seemed to try to frame the issue as something larger than Trump's views.
Short argued that high school coaches across the country are getting punished for leading their players in prayer.
"This is about respect for the military and first-responders in the country," Mnuchin argued.

Today it was announced I will be on the ballot paper for Labour's National Executive Committee elections so I can fight for a more equal Labour Party.
I'm proud we champion equality at election time but we need to ensure our party reflects those values internally. No one should be held back in the Labour Party because of their background, income, age, gender, ethnicity, sexuality or disability.
I'm standing to ensure young women have more opportunities to get involved, to make selections and meetings more accessible to those from all backgrounds and to fight for regional representation on the NEC so it is not just people in London taking the big decisions.
Truly making our party more equal, however, means not just changing structures but our culture.
As a young woman I know that the culture of the Labour Party at all levels can be intimidating and off-putting. Too often we face unwelcoming meetings, difficulties getting involved and even harassment and bullying. Changing the culture of our party to make it more equal must be a priority for the NEC. We must have a welcoming environment for all, free from bullying and harassment, and better procedures in place to deal with incidents when they do arise.
The culture, cost and length of selections results in a lack of diversity among our candidates. We need more women, BAME, LGBT, disabled and working class candidates so we reflect the country we seek to represent. Fairer selections mean shortening the process, reducing the cost, ensuring BAME candidates on every shortlist and changing the culture that too often prevents women getting selected in open shortlists.
All members need to be taken seriously when it comes to our policy-making too. I will fight for a meaningful say in policy for all. Members are more than votes in a leadership election and no one joins the party just to spend their Thursday evenings going through the minutes of the last meeting. We need to harness the expertise and ideas of our growing membership. This means policy events with senior politicians, more opportunities to contribute ideas online and confidence that we members are being listened to by the party.
We also need to get serious about ending the London-centric culture that sees all our decisions taken in the capital and the majority of events there too. I will fight for regional representation on the NEC, so decisions at the top reflect members' views in our regions and nations, not just London.
As your representative on the NEC, I will fight to make our party the true party of equality, where all members can get involved and no one is held back.

Some Conservatives are marking the one-month anniversary of the election this week with an early dose of nostalgia for the former prime minister.
A photo of Stephen Harper, emblazoned with the caption “Miss Me Yet?”, has popped up on the blogs and Facebook posts of some core Conservatives. A new website, strongandfree.org, has declared that Justin Trudeau “is already letting Canada down” and is vowing to “bring conservatism back to Ottawa.”
Everyone needs a dream — and nobody likes a killjoy — so it is with some regret that I'm pointing out that bringing conservatism back to Ottawa is precisely the opposite of what's going on in Canada's capital right now. Nor is anyone figuring it'll be on the agenda for the next four years of a Liberal majority government.
As a matter of fact, the ministerial “mandate letters” released late last week are notable for the many ways in which Trudeau's team intends to dismantle much of what Harper and their government did during their decade in office.
I did a rough count of the nearly 300 to-do items listed under bullets in each of the mandate letters, to see how many of the tasks facing the new Trudeau government revolve around undoing the Conservative record.
I think it's safe to say that more than 50 of the items revolve around rolling back, repealing or amending Conservative policies, in big and small ways. Some of the retreats from conservatism have been announced already — the reinstatement of the mandatory long-form census, for example, and halting the shutdown of veterans services offices.
And this count doesn't include any of the larger reversals in the “tone” set by the Harper era, such as allowing scientists and diplomats to speak publicly about their work and instructing ministers to co-operate with the media.
Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould appears to have the largest list of Conservative measures to unravel; she's already announced the move to abandon a court challenge of niqabs at citizenship ceremonies and has been tasked with a wide-ranging review of the past decade's changes to the criminal justice system. They have also been instructed to restore the old Court Challenges Program and help other ministers repeal bits of the controversial C-51 security law and C-42, the so-called “Common Sense Firearms Act,” which critics said watered down gun control laws in Canada.
Those Conservatives already missing Harper will have tax rates and trade deals to feed their nostalgia, even as the Liberals roll back a lot of the rest of their legacy. Those Conservatives already missing Harper will have tax rates and trade deals to feed their nostalgia, even as the Liberals roll back a lot of the rest of their legacy.
Nearly every minister has some Conservative handiwork to undo, according to the mandate letters. Heritage Minister Mélanie Joly will be reversing funding cuts to the CBC. Democratic Reform Minister Maryam Monsef will be taking a hatchet to many provisions in the Fair Elections Act. Finance Minister Bill Morneau will be scrapping income-splitting for families and other “unfairly targeted tax breaks.”
When Citizenship and Immigration Minister John McCallum is done with the task of getting 25,000 Syrian refugees to Canada by year's end, they also have to repeal provisions in the Citizenship Act that give the government the right to strip citizenship from dual nationals, and also eliminate a $1,000 fee imposed on those who hire foreign caregivers.
Government essentially comes down to three things: doing, undoing and reacting. What we've seen so far from the Trudeau government, especially in light of the Paris shootings last week, is a lot of reacting, some of it obviously on the fly. We've also seen a flurry of undoing, in the tone-change announcements and other measures mentioned in the mandate letters.
So when will the Liberals get around to the “doing” part?
According to the mandate letters, the new Liberal government has proportionally more plans to do than undo — over three-quarters of the items on the ministerial to-do lists are new programs or initiatives. Taken together, the mandate letters are ambitious in scope. But all governments, to be fair, are optimistic and ambitious when power is still shiny and new.
What's not in the letters, obviously, are the Conservative measures that will stay intact, even with Liberals in office.
This has long been a favourite question of mine to pose to opposition politicians: “Is there anything the Conservatives have done in office that can't be undone when a new government takes over?” When I asked Trudeau that question a few years ago, they insisted that nothing the Conservatives did was etched in stone, and much of it could be reversed. Clearly, some of that is underway right now.
We'll have to do another tally in a year or so to see what parts of the Harper legacy remains intact. The trade deals, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, may well be embraced by the Liberals, and certainly no one is talking of raising the GST back to the 7 per cent rate it was at before Harper came to office.
So those Conservatives already missing Harper will have tax rates and trade deals to feed their nostalgia, even as the Liberals roll back a lot of the rest of their legacy.
As for Harper, one has to wonder if they miss these Conservatives as much as they miss him. On Remembrance Day, they were apparently wandering around a Chapters store in Calgary. A local author, Shelley Arnusch, was in the store to promote their new kids' book, Too Many Teddies, when they were approached by the former prime minister.
“He mistook me for store staff and asked if I could help them find the ‘business and economics section,'” Arnusch wrote on Twitter. “I am not making this up.”
Given how Liberals are already rewriting the book on how government is done in Ottawa, and erasing many parts of their legacy, I guess it makes sense for Harper to get caught up on theirs reading.

While admissions counselors are recruiting students to fill for-profit classrooms, the programs' costs are burdening graduates with debt after they leave. (Joel van Houdt for The Washington Post)
Nina M. Flores is a Ph.D. candidate at UCLA's Luskin School of Public Affairs. They teach in the Social and Cultural Analysis of Education graduate program at California State University, Long Beach.
It happened the same way that anyone falls in love: the slow build of excitement, the sheer anticipation of each day propelling you forward, the blind haze of overwhelming joy clouding all reason and logic.
I developed a passion for teaching at a for-profit school in Southern California, and it was exhilarating. My students were inquisitive, thoughtful, and eager to share their ideas. Many were first-generation Americans, and many more were the first in their families to attend college.
But, as it happens, the haze of new love soon lifted.
My students began opening up to me about the incredible amounts of debt they were incurring. For some, this was tens of thousands of dollars each year. I couldn't wrap my head around the fact that the cost of my bachelor's degree and two master's degrees from public schools was adding up to less than half the cost of their bachelor's degrees in business administration, criminal justice or graphic design.
The realization was uncomfortable: I was a part of a business relying on the exploitation of college dreams for money. I won't name my former employer here. It's not worth any potential retribution from system leaders that could affect my ability to get jobs in education and continue working to improve the system. This story is not isolated to one campus. Students are exploited through the for-profit education industry at hundreds of online and on-the-ground campuses every day.
Initially, I deflected students' inquiries about the cost of my own education. But I knew silence helped no one. As a faculty member, I saw two options: continue supporting the status quo, or take steps to help my students empower themselves. So I began sharing education options with them, and the reality that education doesn't have to come at this price.
When students approached me with concerns about paying for school, I spoke openly and honestly about the cost of education at different institutions. I pulled up Web sites for public colleges and said, “Let's sit down and see how much it is for you to go to school there.” When students came to me interested in less-expensive degrees at city colleges or the state university system, we went through the pros and cons of each program together. I reviewed personal statements and served as an academic reference.
I encouraged them to explore their options. These were their questions, their decisions, and it was their right to consider education beyond the for-profit system.
Some transferred, or at least tried to. Most students found that the units they accrued would not transfer to local community colleges or state universities. In one case, as an extra measure, a student asked me to write letters to accompany each class syllabus in hopes of securing course equivalencies at another school. After weighing their options, another student transferred despite leaving completed units behind.
Still others decided to stay. For them, for all my students, I put everything I had into teaching. I made my courses sharper, my pedagogy more engaging and my lessons more community-based. I agreed to lead the loathed faculty trainings in hopes that my enthusiasm would mask my growing unease that my students deserved so much more from their institution and from me. I received stellar class reviews, campus faculty recognition, and was nominated for a national teaching award.
But I'd never felt so torn.
Culturally higher education is synonymous with success in the United States, and a college degree has become necessary to compete in the labor force. Proponents of for-profit colleges – from Kaplan University to DeVry — align themselves with the solution, pointing to the number of degrees made possible through their open-enrollment programs. I've seen and shared that joy with students on graduation day — the pure elation and thrill that comes as they walk the stage, the future a constellation of possibility.
However, this idea sidesteps reality. The inherent design of these schools explicitly puts profits over students. At for-profit colleges across the country, a portion of the campus is devoted to the sales department – a collection of nondescript, cubicle offices where a chorus of voices perpetually echoes the merits of “career-focused education” to prospective students.
The struggle weighed heavily on me, and still does. Once you know, how do you un-know? Maybe ignorance is bliss. The easy solution: find another job. But then what happens in the world of for-profit schools? The ball keeps bouncing, students still enroll, and the exploitative cycles continue. Students deserve college opportunities, but as one for-profit system after another is investigated by the Education Department, it is increasingly clear this is not the way.
I did eventually move on, at least physically. I moved to pursue a doctorate in a different county. But my heart is always with these students. I keep in touch with many of them, watching as their lives take new turns, and seeing their families grow. I'm a listening ear for some about crushing student debt and a supportive reference to others on the job hunt. My love for teaching has only grown stronger over the years. And so too has my commitment to supporting educational justice, in any way that I can.
'Boer bullies' will cost white people dearly
Oh, how sweet would it be if the plea of many white South Africans, again during the last week, that we should stop talking about race and rather walk hand-in-hand into the future, were achievable in my lifetime.
No, it won't.
Many black South Africans probably think it must be just a joy to be a white South African.
Materially speaking we are indeed doing much better than most of our black compatriots, but we also carry an uncomfortable cross that is chafing our necks.
This is not only because our ancestors came to Africa from Europe and dominated for more than three centuries, but also because only eight people out of every hundred South Africans are white; only five out of hundred identify as Afrikaners. We're a tiny, tiny minority.
White people are obviously just people; human beings who love their families; who dream, want to feel safe and desire a secure place in the sun – just like the other 92 out of a hundred citizens.
It is not the making of whites who live today that we find ourselves in Africa with our pale skins.
Yet we cannot pretend that history didn't happen.
The ignorance, the arrogance, the violence of our ancestors towards the people they came across here at the southern tip from the late 17th century onwards; the disruption of indigenous social and political structures; the selfishness of declaring the country "white" and forcing black people to live in and have political rights in black reserves; the cruel enforcement of apartheid since 1948 that was hell-bent on teaching blacks that they were inherently inferior.
And here we are, 23 years after Nelson Mandela and others untied the Gordian knot and we became a democracy.
As Solidarity's Dirk Hermann showed last week when they wrote a letter to Britain's Prince William on the injustices of the South African War 117 years ago (barely a day after they attacked Tumi Morake of Jacaranda FM for bringing up unpleasant memories from their past), we simply can't wipe out history as a bad nightmare.
All of us, also our children, still live with the aftermath of our bitter history in and around us every day.
Now those who have appointed themselves as the political leaders of the five out of a hundred get up and, backed by serious money, aggressively assert themselves as white Afrikaners, shamelessly protect their privilege and launch commercial boycotts because they are no longer dominating.
Solidarity and AfriForum, expert mobilisers of an ethnic nationalism, are going to make it hard for my teenage daughter and youngsters like them to live a happy and rewarding life in South Africa in ten, twenty years' time.
Former newspaper editor Tim du Plessis wrote about this issue on Sunday and posed it as a moral equivalence: the Kallie Kriels (AfriForum boss) and Tumi Morakes both have a case; they are "equally upset".
This is false.
Du Plessis advises me and other AfriForum/Solidarity critics to "stand closer" to them if I want to influence them.
I suppose they mean like the Afrikaans media did with John Vorster and PW Botha in the 1970s and 1980s.
What they forget is that they and other Afrikaans journalists hunted down the old Conservative Party and HNP for their support of the National Party and portrayed them as retarded and backward.
And now that we have a black government, Du Plessis defends these parties' political children who are building a wealthy empire by trading in fear and suspicion?
AfriForum has an aggressive membership drive. They send SMSes like "Andile Mngxitama and BLF want to take your land in December, join us, we'll fight them", or "Ramaphosa admits that ANC wants to disempower whites. Make AfriForum strong and show we're not frogs."
Some months ago a concerned parent called me and said they had received an SMS from AfriForum saying all Afrikaans schools were going to be closed down and invited them to join them to fight it.
They prey on the Afrikaner's insecurities and paranoia and reawaken the old apartheid fears that "blacks will do to us what we did to them" instead of helping them adjust and make peace with the new society.
White South Africans and Afrikaners will have to imagine a new place for themselves in the changed environment, with a greater historic perspective, sensitivity, understanding and realism.
We whites, our children and the Afrikaans language will yet pay a dear price for the Boer bullies who make clever talk about legitimate minority rights and respectful co-existence while they very well know that most of their supporters are crude racists.

There are all kinds of reasons we feel alone in our lives. Some of them are practical, even factual, if you will. I live alone. I spend most of every day alone in my house. I just finished driving about 4,500 miles around the country, about 3,000 of which were done alone in the car. Every once in a while I walk down to a park on the harbor or out on the pier and find a bench and sit alone and watch the water. I don't do it because it's relaxing, to calm my nerves. I do it because a bench on the water is a change of scene. The water does all the stuff it's supposed to do, with the breeze riffling its surface, the sailboats bobbing at their moorings. It can be indescribably beautiful when the light is right and the water sparkles or turns crimson and orange and violet at sunset, but the harbor is just another place to be alone.
I never thought I'd be living like this when I was in my 20s, but I had my suspicions. I used to spend a lot of time driving around the country in a 1968 Dodge camper van writing stories for the Village Voice and various magazines. I made a point of driving through Aspen in the fall to visit an old friend of mine who was a ski bum waiter out there. Them name was Cherry. We were school kids together in Oberammergau, Germany in the mid-1950s. We used to put on our ski boots every morning and ski from our apartment building's front door to the school down the hill and stack our skis against the wall outside. We would change out of our ski boots into regular shoes, and later when school let out, change back into our ski boots and ski through the village of Oberammergau to the ski area on the mountainside just beyond, ski until the place closed at dusk and then ski home in the dark. It was a magical time, a memory we shared fondly.

They had lived in Aspen for about ten years, alternately waitering and skiing and traveling the globe. Every summer they took about $1,500 they had saved up and split, but now they were back in Aspen to pick up where they had left off in the spring. They were gorgeous — blonde hair, rosy-tanned cheeks, elegantly muscled body in a t-shirt with a day-pack on their back, moving through town like an antelope through a field. I was sitting in the window of the Jerome Bar and spied them coming down the street and waved. They came in, we embraced ... it had been about a year since we had seen each other ... and they took one look at me and said let's hike up to the Conundrum Hot Springs tomorrow.
I had heard a lot about the hot springs but had avoided them due to my natural aversion to the idea of walking eight miles uphill to get to them. But now I found myself saying, yeah, let's go. I had no equipment, no hiking boots, only a down vest and a sleeping bag. So I put together some amateurish supplies — homemade fried chicken, extra set of clothes, a knife, six cans of Coors and a fifth of Henry McKenna in a special plastic jug which I picked up from a local mountaineering store, along with a day pack to put it all in. I thought stupidly that I would come up with some way to put the cost of the supplies on some magazine's expense account tab, but I blew that off. The logical thing to do was get with Cherry and head for the hot springs, so the next morning I met them and off we went driving up one of the valleys outside of Aspen on a dirt road in Cherry's little Datsun. Finally a big meadow appeared and we parked. On went the packs, and with a last glance around at the edge of civilization, we hiked.
The climb began immediately — short and steep, longer gradual grades followed by quick dips, and then another steep slope, never a flat stretch. There was a fire in my legs, pulling, straining in the thighs up through the lower back to the trapezius yielding soreness across the shoulders, tightening in the lungs and a numbing sense of futility that the steep slopes would never end that you'd never get there. We walked, walked, walked, crossing a creek once, twice, three times within a mile, gazing down into pools of trout. And you walked on, past the beaver lodges stately as twig mansions in the middle of small ponds at 10,000 ... 10,500 ... 11,000 feet.
Up there, things really started to change. The light crashed through softly blowing aspens, landing on the grass like droplets of clear water. I started out babbling away, telling tall stories about covering Bebe Rebozo and their part in Watergate, what nightmare covering the Evel Knievel jump of the Snake River Canyon was, and Cherry listened and threw back their head, laughing at the folly of talking and talking and talking in a place where the only really important sound was all around us in the wind and the trees. As we went higher, I fell into their natural silence, their easy awareness of everything around them I felt a lightening of my senses. The creek, once a docile trout stream, now fell steeply over mossy rocks booming into deep pools.
We stopped to rest and discussed the matter of firewood and decided we'd better gather some before we reached the tree line. They took off their pack and began gathering and breaking up sticks as big around as your calf. Collecting together a pile with some kindling, they untied their pack-flap and strapped the wood across their pack. I did the same with mine; we put our packs on and started up again. We crossed the tree line and continued to climb past boulders and hillocks of fallen scree and ended up on a flat ledge just at the top of a hundred foot waterfall and unpacked, laying out our sleeping pads and sleeping bags and getting a fire ready to light when we returned from the springs later. It was getting dark, so we walked further up the trail, and finally across a low marshy slope we could see the hot springs — three indigo pools set dead center in a bowl formed by a long ridge and mountain peak another 2,000 feet above us. Cherry was standing in front of me, taking in the view of the springs, legs together, just staring. There was a stillness in the air around them that was easy to get lost in.
Cherry turned to me. "What do you think?" they asked. The blue pools of the hot springs were like shimmering beads of sweat on the forehead of the mountain in the late afternoon sun.

"You told me it would be like this, but I didn't believe you," I said. We took off our clothes and got into the deepest pool as the sky darkened above us. The water was a hot luscious caress of bubbly sulfurous fingers. We stayed in there as little by little the mountainsides around us were lit up by the moon, still out of sight, and then it began moving down the mountainsides, and it was about 100 yards away from us, moving much faster, then 50 then 25, and suddenly the springs were awash in moonlight, our naked bodies visible below the surface.
We were believers, dreamers like we all were back in the ‘60s, believing that if we all did our own thing and took responsibility for ourselves, it would somehow turn out okay. Cherry lived out their dreams by hiking in the high boonies; ski-touring a wilderness area for two weeks camping out in the snow; running white water on the Colorado River or the Snake River, any water that was fast and brown and mean. They were the first licensed boatswoman in the Grand Canyon and probably the first American woman to hike alone to the 17,000 foot high base camp on Everest. I was living another dream, traveling around writing about virtually anything I wanted to write about and getting paid for it, living in a loft in New York City for $200 a month, hanging out backstage at the Fillmore East, flying overseas to cover wars. Jesus, that sentence sounds not so much like a dream as a lie. Could all of that have been true? About each of us?
We had no way of knowing it, but by that night at the hot springs we were both on our way to becoming anachronisms. The paper I wrote for the Village Voice would be sold to New York Magazine founder Clay Felker and begin a long slow slide into irrelevancy. The magazines I wrote for would close, one after another. Freelancing, once an impossibly romantic way to make a living, would become the bottomlessly exploitable gig economy.
The stuff Cherry did for real was already being transformed into mass-market products. John Denver and Robert Redford began marketing the mountains to the masses. Ralph Lauren, whose store in East Hampton today looks like the living room of some hunting lodge in Montana, was right behind them with “distressed” denim and pre-tattered blue jean jackets and sheepskin coats that look like they were recovered from the wreckage of a failed arctic expedition. Today, there are entire industries racing to exploit trends that are over almost before they get started. Rock and roll went from being a feeling in your gut to just another product. All the stuff that felt like it was bringing us together ended up pulling us apart. Music that once blasted from East Village tenement windows and filled the air with attitude is inside ear buds. We aren't living in a bubble. We are, each of us, a bubble. We are alone.

Even walking together up that mountain in Colorado to the hot springs, Cherry and I were as alone as I am in this room. It has taken me decades to begin to understand why, and even now it's not clear to me. I think part of it is because we were forever trying on new stuff — new clothes, new music, new attitudes, new places to live. Cherry was busy becoming a new kind of woman. I was forever playing to catch up, trying to figure out what it meant to be a new woman's kind of man. Newness filled every corner of our lives. Forward movement was all that mattered. But how can you be somewhere if you never settle down? How can you be a part of something if you're never really in it?
I got an answer when I was on the road earlier this month. I drove down to Birmingham, Alabama to drop off my daughter at their cousins'. I spent the night in a motel before heading back. I was staying in an upscale suburb and looking for a place to eat supper, so I drove around a bit and checked out what was available. Walking out of the second place with “bistro” in its name, I started to chuckle. What was brand new in Greenwich Village in 2000 had arrived in Birmingham at last. Then I went back in and sat down at the bar and ordered.
The place was filled with people having a great time. The food was downright decent. I thought back to Greenwich Village in 2000. Bistro this, trattoria that. Hadn't I been in Europe a few years earlier and eaten the same stuff ... only it was actually French because it was in France? Weren't those crowds in all of the "chic boites" in the Village happy just like the people in Birmingham were, eating “authentic” French cuisine in an entirely inauthentic place? Hadn't Keith McNally invented the whole damn feel-like-you're-in-Paris scam with Balthazar? Weren't these Trump voters in Birmingham chasing the same dream the swells were chasing on the edge of Soho in New York? Weren't they having as much fun? Wasn't the food just about the same? Didn't Keith McNally keep giving the swells new places to go, opening Pastis and Schiller's and Morandi and Minetta Tavern and Pulino . . . I think eleven restaurants in all? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes and yes.

We have atomized ourselves. We keep moving on, from one restaurant to another, from one hairstyle to another, from one shirt collar to another, from one make of high heels to another, from one brand of SUV to another, from one Hamptons nightclub to another. Nothing sparkles with enough newness. There is never enough of anything. Enough new fashion. Enough new kinds of exercise. Enough new taste sensations. Enough destinations. Enough parties. Enough money. You keep moving like this, and you end up leaving stuff behind. You leave places. You leave friends. You leave principles. You leave yourself.
One night not long after I left Birmingham I was out walking the dogs and they were sniffing around in the grass taking their time doing their business, and I looked up and saw the big night sky above me filled with stars stretching away out there forever and ever and ever, and I was standing there in a very nice subdivision in Franklin, Tennessee, and I felt as alone as I've ever felt in my life. I was surrounded by all of these people who belonged there, and I was moving on. It was a little like that night in the hot spring with Cherry: a big night sky above that ring of mountains, and the two of us down there in the hot spring, and afterwards we dried off and went back to our camp and built a fire and fixed supper and climbed in our sleeping bags, and the next day we walked down the mountain and moved on.
People I know, who are in one way or another people like me, people who have changed so much over the years, people who used to be heavy metal rockers but who are now new age life coaches, people who used to be bartenders but who are now world renowned artists, people who can play the guitar as well as they can pound nails and lay tile, these people who are like me despair at the rootlessness of the Democrats, the damaged “brand,” the absence of a “message.” But it's not just about political tactics and strategy. It's about isolating ourselves at the tables of the latest hot restaurant or behind the reflective walls of social media, where we can be alone with ourselves and people like us, and we can see out but they can't see in. It's no wonder that Trump's 35-40 percent base of support seems so impermeable. The pundits tell us that their voters feel collectively resentful and forgotten and left behind. Well, they're right. We're the ones who left them behind because we're forever in transit to someplace new, chasing cool stuff, changing ourselves, altering the country, moving on and not looking back.

Blizzard has a small really small team working on SC2 right now. So its really important they know what the community as a whole values the most, so they can get it fixed. From a pro players point of view, I know what is the most important to me. But what I can't know, is what the majority of people want from the game.
So please take a few minutes and THINK (like really think hard, if you are continuing to read after this sentence you should be stopped and thinking!) about the different things you'd want fixed. Here is an easy-to-use Poll that I'd love you to take part in. And if I missed something in the Poll you'd like to have me put up, please just let me know.

(Did you stop and think before you did the poll? I don't mind either way!)
Anywho I want to be able to show a clear list of what is most important to you. I probably accidentally left out a few things that are very important. Hopefully one thing stands out, or several things. If none of those are MOST important to you, then please post what you think IS. Please take just a second and share your thoughts, because in the grand scheme of things I want this game to keep getting better. And because it seems Blizzard wants to focus on one thing at a time, its important we give them something that you really want.
If you can't choose between two, then feel free to put them down. Maybe you think its perfect the way it is, your welcome to say that. If you give a frick, please click.

Mostly by stuff that wasn't entirely their fault.
AP/Shasta Co. Sheriff's Dept. Shane Miller, 45, is suspected of a triple homicide at their home in rural Northern California.
A survivalist accused of killing their wife and two young daughters after hiding an arsenal of weapons in an underground bunker is still on the run seven months later, in one of the few cases of gun violence against children in the U.S. without an arrest since the Newtown shootings.
Shane Franklin Miller, 45, a sometime marijuana grower with a criminal record, is the sole suspect in the May 7 shooting deaths of their 34-year-old wife Sandra and their two daughters, aged eight and four, in the remote Northern California village of Shingletown. He's on the U.S. Marshals' Most Wanted list after disappearing into the foggy wilds of Humboldt County, famed for rugged, forest-clad mountains and hidden marijuana farms.
“He better hope that the police get hold of them before a lot of the guys around here, because they would just as soon tar and feather them and string them up,” Vera De Witt, president of a local non-profit raising money for a memorial for the girls, told NBC News.
De Witt said the slayings had shocked the town of 2,300 and generated “painful questions” for children. “Particularly,” they said, “little girls going home and asking, ‘Daddy, would you kill me, would you shoot me?' ”
Two weeks before the bodies were found at the Miller home on Alpine Way, Shasta County sheriff's deputies had been called to the house over a domestic dispute.
Sandy Miller told the officers that their husband was “abusive,” according to a U.S. Marshals affidavit. The deputies escorted Sandra Miller from their home and they drove more than 150 miles west to Humboldt County, where their family and their husband's family live. But later the same day, Miller found them at a motel in Humboldt and “forced them to return” to Shingletown, according to the affidavit.
“He also threatened to kill them and their daughters if they left them again,” said the affidavit. “On the morning of the murders, Sandy Miller told their mother that they planned on telling Miller later that day they were leaving him.”
Just before 8 p.m. on May 7, someone at the Miller home called 911. A dispatcher heard a woman sobbing and loud banging sounds. Deputies who went to the house found the doors locked and Sandy and their daughters Shelby Ann, 8, and Shasta, 4, shot to death inside. Shane Miller's gold 2010 Dodge Mega Cab pickup was missing.
The search for Miller started in Humboldt County. A day after the killings, their truck was found in a remote area near the tiny town of Petrolia, less than five miles from the Pacific. A week later, hikers found Miller's dog wandering along the Lost Coast Trail, which winds through the redwoods and Douglas firs high above the ocean.
Humboldt County and the rest of California's “Lost Coast,” where the green mountains of the King Range plunge down to the sea, is the most undeveloped section of the state's shoreline. Its dense forests have few roads, towns or people and are little known to outsiders. But Miller knows the area. They grew up in Humboldt County, and was a sometime participant in one of the area's major industries – growing marijuana. They were convicted of felony cultivation in 1996. They also racked up arrests for hit and run, DUI, money laundering, marijuana cultivation, and illegal possession of a machine gun, before spending nearly four years in federal prison on a gun charge. They were released in 2007.
People who know Miller have told local media that they have survival skills. The Marshals describe them as an “avid outdoorsman,” and the affidavit describes them as “a survivalist, who frequently uses cash for purchases.”
Authorities also learned that just before the shootings, Miller and their wife had traveled to Seattle, and that Miller had called real estate offices from their cellphone during the trip. They were able to confirm that they made an inquiry about a rural property near Roseburg, Ore. According to the Marshals' affidavit, they speculated that they had bought property in Oregon using cash and a fake name and had fled there to hide after the killings. In a separate court filing in June, the U.S. Attorney's office said that Miller might have fled to Mexico.
But in late June, authorities turned the search back to the area near Shingletown in the hills leading to the high country of Lassen Volcanic National Park. Tips had come in that Miller might be hiding on two properties that they owned in the community of Whitmore, about 25 miles to the north. An intensive search turned up a homemade underground fortress. An elaborate, prefabricated bunker was buried on one of the properties, with vent pipes hidden by wood and other debris, according to the Shasta County Sheriff's Office. Inside, investigators say, was an arsenal of rifles, shotguns and handguns.
But there was no sign of Shane Miller, and no indication that he'd been there since the killings, the Sheriff's Office said. On July 30, Miller was added to the U.S. Marshals' 15 Most Wanted Fugitives List.
Since then, investigators say, they have received thousands of tips.
“We get about 30 a day,” said Deputy Marshal Brandon McMullen with the U.S. Marshals Service. “We've had all sorts of leads that we've followed up on but had nothing that's panned out.”
A lead that someone fit Miller's description had been seen in September near Fort Jones, north of Redding, Calif. near the Oregon border, didn't pan out. There were even reports that authorities in India were on the lookout for Miller, just in case they mingled with tourists visiting the Himalayan foothills.
Courtesy Deborah Benge Sandra Miller holds their dog on Glass Beach near Fort Bragg, Calif. in April 2013, a month before they were killed.
Miller remains at large, with a $25,000 reward for their capture.  They are considered armed and dangerous.
Back in Shingletown, people are trying to make sense out of the senseless.
“It was kind of a shock to the neighborhood,” said Stanley Magagnosc, 90, who lives on a property near the Millers but didn't know them. The 10- to 15-acre plots in the pines along Alpine Way make it easy for people to maintain their privacy, they said, and Miller fenced their property and didn't wave back when neighbors waved hello.
De Witt, president of the Shingletown Activities Council and a community leader, said local children were hit particularly hard. Shelby was a third-grader at Black Butte Elementary School, and Shasta attended a nearby preschool. Sandra Miller volunteered in Shelby's classroom, De Witt said.
To commemorate the victims, De Witt raised money to plant memorial trees. Two dogwoods were planted over the summer, one at the elementary school, one at the preschool. A third tree was planted at the town library. At a memorial service June 26, more than 100 people gathered to hear a member of Sandra Miller's family speak; $400 left over from contributions for the trees was donated to the library for children's books, De Witt said.
“The trees will always be there, along with the books,” they said.
Deborah Benge keeps a photo of Sandra Miller in a special place at home. In the photo, Miller is sitting on Glass Beach near Fort Bragg, a month before their death, their strawberry blond locks curling around their face. Benge did Miller's hair at the Hot Locks salon in Shingletown for three years.
“We had this connection between us that was just like kindred spirits,” Benge said. “I just felt like we were related or something. I still feel that connection.”
Benge said Sandra Miller never spoke of problems at home. They described them as as “a real good mom, a very calm spirit, a very sweet spirit.” Benge said that even seven months after the killings, they have been unable to bring themselves to take Miller's card out of the salon's active clients file.
“I really would like closure on this,” they said.
And what would that take?
“When they get him, I know that I'll feel peace,” they said.

We've made it all the way to the final weekend of the Big East season but the madness of March is just about to get started. All ten Big East teams are tipping off on Saturday between 12pm and 2:30pm ET and there is still some jockeying going on for the 3, 4, 5 and 6 seeds, not to mention the NCAA Tournament implications that are in play with many of Saturday's games.

I hope this will be met with an open mind and the capacity for self-scrutiny.
Dear Filmmakers,
It is a thrill, what we do. Hypnotizing audiences to believe in a reality that we've created. With light, electricity, programming, flesh, and bone, we are able to sew together a series of moments that can only be found in our dreams.
There's a magic to filmmaking.
We find ourselves having access to the infinite world of the internet and thankfully many of us have been given a chance that we wouldn't have had otherwise. I am thankful every day that I am able to call myself a filmmaker. I'm scared sh*tless to admit it because I know that my skill is far inferior to thousands of other filmmakers who are more dedicated, more talented.
When joining the ranks of the film world, an amateur will burden themselves with many unnecessary philosophies and notions. They think that having the right camera is the first and foremost place to start. DSLRs, several years ago, were the game-changer that allowed amateur filmmakers to get a taste of the good stuff: “Pretty Filmmaking.”
I had a revelation several months back after watching countless YouTube videos that were amazing. Despite their beauty, they lacked an aspect of filmmaking that was a core belief of mine: a decent camera. These videos were using cheap, point-and-shoot or entry-level DSLRs that were pulling off incredible shots. It finally dawned on me that my pursuit of professional gear had to take a sober look at itself.
My Cinema Camera (Yes, cinema.)
The Gear Excuse
Filmmakers and creatives alike are loaded with excuses. “IF” becomes the favorite word in our vocabulary because it offloads the locus of control from ourselves to the Outside World.
“If I only had a high-end camera, then I could make a great movie.”
“No one will want to watch this movie if it was shot on a crappy camera like this!”
Be Shameless
The only way to break this trend of Gear Envy is for us to be Shameless. We must be shameless in our pursuit of a good story and to be proud or disinterested about what camera we use. I've twisted myself up in circles and succumb to DOUBT time and time again because I truly believed that my talents would be limited to my equipment. Bullsh*t.
We must approach our Craft head on with a reckless abandon and we should place the camera choice low on the priority list.
Get out there and get shooting!
What do you think? Agree? Disagree? I would love to hear.
Thanks for reading and if you love it then show it!

Squirrel Foils Attempted Theft
Idaho isn't always a hot bed for news. But this week a pet squirrel scared off a would-be burglar trying to break into a gun safe.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Imagine a home security system that costs acorns. Teenager broke into a home in Meridian, Idaho, this week. And when they tried to break into a gun safe in the house, they got scratched by Joey, a pet squirrel. Joey's holed up in the home of Adam Pearl of Meridian since they were found in a flower garden about six months ago. They haven't been trained as a security squirrel but reportedly, trained themselves to use a litter box. They eat nuts, greens and spinach. A lot of us could stand to be on the same diet as Joey.
Adam Pearl said he'd planned to release Joey into their backyard this spring. But after Joey foiled a burglar, they say, I'm kind of torn. They told KIVI in Boise, nobody can believe it because who can say they have a squirrel that guards their house?
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "SECRET SQUIRREL ")
UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: What an agent. What a squirrel. He's got the country in a whirl. What's their name? Secret Squirrel. He's got tricks up their sleeve most bad guys won't believe - a bulletproof coat, a cannon hat, machine gun cane with a rat tat tat tat.

It often takes a major event to catalyze change. Whether violent conflict or a major storm, seeing the worst often pushes us to make difficult decisions for the better.
While we wait to see what lasting impact—if any—Hurricane Sandy has on environmental policy in the U.S., it is helpful to look to Asia and reflect on a storm that literally pushed cloistered Burma toward reform.
Cyclone Nargis, which quickly overwhelmed the least developed Southeast Asian state on May 2nd, 2008, provided the necessary spark for a politically troubled government's reforms to take place.
At that time, participatory politics and stronger institutions were desperately needed in Burma to more effectively deal with the threat of increasingly intense tropical cyclones in Asia.
I happened to be in Yangon at the time of Nargis, a storm that would result, in conservative estimates, 138,000 people killed or missing. Millions more were left without housing or clean water, and the livelihoods of thousands of families were destroyed. The low-lying, and heavily irrigated Irrawaddy Delta region, south of the country's capital, was especially badly hit.
As information began to trickle out of the country, widely held views in the international community of the country's repressive policies and opacity were confirmed. The storm evidenced the ill-equipped nature of the government and its lack of capacity in recovering from such a significant catastrophe.
Worried about western-led pro-democracy plots to usurp its power, Burma's government waited for days before allowing any outside assistance.
New Beginnings
The day Cyclone Nargis hit, the New Light of Myanmar, a government-controlled English language daily, focused heavily on the impending constitutional referendum, aimed at solidifying the military's role in government. The banner headline read, “To approve the State Constitution is a national duty of the entire people today.” Mention of the impending Cyclone Nargis could only be found buried in a weather report that called for “Some rain and thundershowers.”
On May 10th, eight short days after the storm hit, the government proceeded with its vote. It determined that 92% of eligible voters were in favor of the new constitution in elections considered by international and domestic observers to be fraudulent. Just six months before Nargis, monks took to the streets as part of the Saffron Revolution, calling for political reform. Burma's ruling generals were keen to further assert their strength in the face of lingering domestic unrest.
Police track down teenage girl filmed throwing live puppies into a river
A girl shown in a video throwing puppies into a fast-flowing river has been traced, police in Bosnia said today.
The teenager, wearing a hooded top, caused worldwide outrage when they were shown online apparently killing six newborn puppies by throwing them into the river one by one.
Police in the central Bosnian town of Bugojno said they had found the girl from leads given by animal protection groups in the country.
MailOnline knows the name of the girl involved but has decided not to publish to protect them safety.
The video appears to show a girl throwing live puppies into a fast-flowing river
The teenage girl kneels down to lift what looks like a live puppy from the bucket
The girl's parents will soon be questioned, police said. Under Bosnian law, people can be fined up to £4,000 for animal cruelty.
Such was the international fury it prompted Transformers movie director Michael Bay to offer a $50,000 (£32,500) reward for the prosecution of the young woman.

On their website, the director said: 'There is a disturbing video going around the news outlets. It's a video of blonde young woman in a red sweatshirt casually tossing squealing puppies into the fast-moving river one by one.'
They offered the reward for 'information leading to the arrest and successful prosecution of the woman in the red sweatshirt and the person who shot this act of cruelty'.
Animal rights group 'Flekice' (Spots) filed a complaint to police claiming the girl seen on the video, originally posted on YouTube, came from the central town of Bugojno.
Another animal rights group - SOS, which is based in Sarajevo - also claimed to have information confirming the location of the girl, who was reportedly filmed by their brother.
Velimir Ivanisevic from the group said they received an email that allegedly identifies them as a teenager from the central Bosnian town of Bugojno.
'We cannot say with 100 per cent certainty that this is true, but we received some other information which leads us to believe that it is,' Ivanisevic said.
Bosnian law requires anyone who kills or injures an animal to pay a fine ranging from €15 to €5,000 (£12 to £4,150) .
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) offered a €1,500 (£1,300) reward earlier this week to help catch the young woman in the film
The video has prompted outrage among internet groups all over the world

The 44-second video shows a blonde girl in a red sweatshirt casually tossing the squealing black-and-white puppies into the river one by one.
The video has been removed from YouTube but niot before it was embedded on a number of other sites.
Several Facebook pages were created dedicated to exposing the girl, who appears to be a teenager.
Users of the image forum 4chan, who recently identified a British woman who dumped a cat into a wheelie bin, have vowed to unmask them
They had already tracked down bank worker Mary Bale after CCTV of their dumping a cat in a rubbish bin was published online.

A lawyer says they are "living the dream" after they landed a job performing as ice princess Elsa from Frozen at weekends.
Lucy Broughton, who trained for four years to be a lawyer, realised they were a dead ringer for the film's hero Elsa when a friend pointed it out.
So the self-confessed “Disney obsessive” approached an agency which specialises in hiring out Disney princesses – and became Elsa.
Now the 23-year-old spends weekdays in the courtroom, specialising in civil litigation, and weekends as Elsa, the princess with the magical ability to turn things into ice and snow.
“I am living my dream,” the University graduate said.

They entertain children at parties and sings songs from the films such as Let It Go and Do You Want to Build A Snowman? to them.
They even apply ice crystals round their face to make them look extra authentic.
Miss Broughton, who lives in Manchester, said: “A friend commented I look a bit like Elsa and I wondered if there was something I could do with it.
“I realised I wanted to carry on being a lawyer. I had trained for years and spent a lot of money. But I also wanted to be Elsa.
“So I approached the agency Tinkerbella and they thought I fitted in.
“I was given training and I became a princess.”
They said their colleagues knew of their princess alter ego.
“They think it's funny,” they said.
“I don't wear my Frozen clothes at work. I'm usually in a suit."

“But at weekends I use extensions to get my hair longer, wear a long silky blue dress and lots of glittery makeup," they added.
“I have a cape too. I chat to the children, sing with them. Have a good time really.”
The University of Leeds graduate said they had always loved Disney.
“When I was younger I had every outfit from Snow White to Cinderella,” they admitted.
“I knew all the songs too.
“But I realised being a princess wasn't going to pay the bills so I worked hard at school and went to university to study law."

“Yet in my spare time, I'd snuggle down and watch my favourite Disney movies again and again.," Lucy admitted.
“When Frozen was released, I talked my sister into coming to see it with me.
“I didn't care we were so much older than the rest of the audience.
“While my days were high powered and important, I still found myself longing for a bit of Disney magic.
“I'm so pleased my fairy tale is now a reality.
“Now most days are spent in the courtroom, but on the weekends, I sing, do face painting and entertain little girls to give them a magical birthday.”
Like many of you, for a long time I really couldn't see the use of those URL shortener service thingies. Sure, when I was designing sites I tried to avoid long, ugly URLs, but I never saw slapping some random characters after a common base URL as being any more useful. I considered my awareness of the existence of these obscure services as an aberration induced by my geek genes, rather than validation of their existence or popularity.
Then came Twitter, and the world of URLs was never the same.
Twitter firmly swapped URL shorteners out of the occasionally useful into the pretty darn essential column. That magical 140-character limits, combined with the propensity of major sites to use URLs nearly as long as their software user agreements, thrust shorteners in front of millions of new eyeballs.
One issue, pointed out by more than a few security pundits and rickrolling victims, is that these shorteners completely obscure the underlying URL. It's trivial for a malicious attacker to hide a link and redirect a user to any sort of malicious site. It didn't take long for phishers and drive-by malware attacks to take advantage of the growing popularity of these obfuscation services.
Some of the more popular Twitter clients, like Tweetie, added optional URL previews to show users the full link before clicking through to the site. In part, this was enabled by shorteners like bit.ly enabling previews through their APIs. A nice feature, but it's not one that most users enable, and it isn't available in most web interfaces or even all standalone Twitter clients.
Bit.ly announced today that they are taking things one major step further and will soon be scanning all links, in real time, using multiple security services. Bit.ly will be using a collection of databases and scanning services to check both new and existing links as users access them. Websense's cloud-based scanner is one of the services (the one that pre-briefed me), and bit.ly will use at least one other commercial service as well as some free/open databases.
Update: according to the bit.ly blog, VeriSign and Sophos are the other scanning/database engines.
In the case of Websense, bit.ly will tie directly into their content scanning service to check links in real time as they are added to the bit.ly database. Websense uses a mix of real time scans (for things like malware and certain phishing techniques) and their database of known bad sites. The system won't rely only on the database of previously-detected bad sites, but will also check them at access time.
If a link is suspected of being malicious, Websense marks it and bit.ly will redirect users to a warning page instead of directly to the site. Users can still click through, and I'm sure plenty will, but at least those of us with a little common sense are less likely to be exploited.
Bit.ly won't only be scanning new links added to the database, but will be checking existing links in case they've become compromised. This also reduces the chances of the bad guys gaming the system by adding a clean version of their site for an initial scan, then sneaking in malware for future visits.
I like bit.ly's approach of checking existing links in case they get compromised, rather than only scanning new links as they are added. This will make it harder for bad guys to game the system. This solution is a lot better than the anti-phishing built into browsers and some search engines, since those rely only on databases of previously-discovered known bad sites.
It's also a two-way system, and although Websense is being paid for the scanning, they gain the additional benefit of now leveraging the results once millions of new (and old) links start flowing through their service. Every bad website Wensense finds when a user submits a link to bit.ly is added to the database used by all their other products.
Finally, there's nothing that says we're only allowed to use bit.ly for Twitter. The entire Internet now gains a real-time security scanning service… for free. Have a questionable link? Shorten it through bit.ly and it's scanned by Websense and at least one other commercial service, as well as all the free/open/cheap databases bit.ly uses (sorry, I don't know what they are).
This isn't to say that any of the individual scans, or all of them together, can identify every malicious link they encounter, but this is a significant advance in web services security. It's a perfect example of cloud computing enhancing security, rather than creating new risks. Links sent through bit.ly will now be safer than the original links viewed directly.
This isn't live yet, but should be by the end of the year.

The US Pavilion at the Shanghai 2010 World Expo is not the handsomest pavilion at the Expo nor will it be the most memorable. In fact, it is rather pedestrian, inside and out. For this it has rightly been criticized by architects, planners, designers, and its many, many Chinese visitors who, after waiting two hours to enter, are treated to little more than a few short films and corporate promotions.
The questionable quality of the US Pavilion, however, is symptomatic of a larger problem that the critics mostly have ignored, which is the "Blackwatering" of US public diplomacy: the privatization and outsourcing of every device by which America and its people traditionally have connected with other nations and cultures.
In defense circles, the term "Blackwater" is synonymous with high-priced mercenary soldiers whose unconstrained behavior threatens to derail America's military goals. Applied to public diplomacy, as in Shanghai, "Blackwatering" means missing an historic, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for authentic communication with the rest of the world.
The Shanghai 2010 World Expo is a globalist's dream become reality. For the first time in memory, the nations of the world have gathered in peace, in one of the world's most dynamic regions, to celebrate "The Century of the City." Seventy million Chinese are expected to visit in person. 100 million visitors from around the world are expected to tour the site online and via the media.
Despite sometimes garish and undecodable exteriors, inside, the pavilions tell stories, literally and allegorically, about their societies' vision of the future. Each converges on what is most relevant and important to its national situation.
The Shanghai Expo's inspiring theme, "Better City, Better Life," from which national pavilion designers have extrapolated many promising narratives. In the "Better City,"
* A quality urban development leads to better experiences and opportunities.
* Sustainability is mandatory in the urban settlement and its surroundings.
* Places and services adhere to green principles and edify urban residents.
* Happier, healthier lifestyles and social behaviors are the goal and the norm.
* Governance must be democratic: open, inclusive, and collaborative.
The US Pavilion honors none of these themes or stories. As many observers have noted, the US Pavilion is the perfect embodiment of mainstream corporate America's uni-dimensional approach to urbanity. The US Pavilion's development shares a lot with the typical commercial shopping mall:
To get started, set up a shell corporation. Lobby powerful politicians for favors and support. Spend profligately. Choose designs and materials that are conventional and ugly. Ignore landscaping. In a typical food court, push meals that are fast, fatty, and fried. In the glitzy theater, feature a pricey Hollywood feel-good fantasy. Keep it short, shallow, and light.
Promote your tenants' corporate brands. Sell stuff, lots of stuff. Use copious PR and advertising to keep critics at bay and the press subservient. Bring in celebrities to create a sense of importance.
Lastly, do not educate the public. Do not teach the American people what's at stake and why they should care. Above all, do not involve them in your undertaking - even if it is their imprimatur, their collective spirit that adds precious value that you trade on. Avoid transparency. Hide the books. Flip the property. Divide the assets. Make out like bandits.
The U.S. Pavilion
In the end, the US Pavilion offers no vision of the future. Like so many of the busted malls at home that it so closely resembles, the US Pavilion is fragmentary and momentary, not the beacon of hope the Expo hosts expected or that the American people deserve. For a long time, pre-opening polls listed the (in concept) US Pavilion as the most highly anticipated attraction for Chinese Expo-goers, after the giant red China Pavilion. No longer. A week before the Expo, China Daily, the nation's official paper, has removed the US Pavilion from its list of important things to visit and see at the Expo.
How did things come to this sorry pass?
The US Pavilion today is the outcome of a basic policy decision to "Blackwater" American public diplomacy, outsourcing its conduct to private parties. The Bush Administration devised the policy in 2006. To cover for this historic, first-time decision not to seek a Congressional appropriation to pay for a US Pavilion at a major World Expo, the Administration began disseminating a Big Lie: that a law on the books prevented public funding. For the next two years, a careless press repeated this untruth, thus making privatization seem inevitable.
But the Rice State Department's execution was sloppy. In late 2007, for example, it published a competitive RFP for potential pavilion producers with terms intended to be impossible to meet. When, however, the BH&L Group, a team of Expo veterans led by designers Barry Howard and Leonard Levitan, came very close to fulfilling those terms, State was forced to abort the RFP on the verge of negotiations, in December 2007. The pavilion project had come too close to becoming public!
Three months later, in March 2008, without public notice or review, State sole-sourced the US Pavilion assignment to a pair with limited Expo experience but powerful inside-government connections: Ellen Eliasoph, an entertainment attorney with the influential Covington & Burling law firm (often deemed "the shadow State Department"), and former film executive and Expo dabbler Nick Winslow. They incorporated in DC as a nonprofit corporation, "Shanghai Expo 2010, Inc." (SE 2010). Fired up with a half-million-dollar cash contribution from a New Jersey herbal-medicine company (strangely, one with its operations in Shanghai), they went to work passing the hat.
SE 2010 blew through its seed capital in six months trying to sell an over-expensive, poorly designed, dull white elephant. Their $85-million US Pavilion concept, designed by Canadian Clive Grout,with a filmic centerpiece proposed by BRC Information Arts, languished without takers. Eliasoph and Winslow publicly resigned the assignment in October 2008, only to be yanked back to life by Consul General Bea Camp and their staff, apparently acting on their own recognizance.
The Consulate, press accounts allege, administered an infusion of more Chinese money and Chinese engineers redid the existing plan, eliminating such luxury items as LEED standards. The price was reduced to a still hefty $61 million. When Shanghai's substantial American expat business community protested perceived carpet-bagging; the Consulate simply excluded it from future planning sessions.
The curious cherry on this half-baked cake: sometime in 2009 the IRS awarded SE 2010, which had become essentially a commercial real-estate brokerage, with the US Pavilion its sole client, tax exempt status. That means that the American people will be picking up the tab for taxes not paid by SE 2010 and its corporate partners for the privilege of using the USA "brand" on their Shanghai store.
Is this the inspiration for the US Pavilion design? A sponsor tie-in?
In February 2009, newly elected President Barack Obama appointed former opponent Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State. With the Expo's hosts threatening to foreclose on the US Pavilion and reclaim its well-situated plot, Clinton picked up the phone and went into high gear, fundraising as if once again running for President. Them first committed sponsor was Yum!, the giant fast-food restaurant chain (KFC, Taco Bell, etc.), followed in close order by PepsiCo, Walmart, Monsanto, Microsoft, AT&T, and other global corporations - not exactly paragons of sustainability, healthy lifestyles, or quality urban planning, but loaded with cash.
When the dust had cleared, more than 60 multinationals - Chinese as well as American - had ponied up more than the required $61 million on terms unknown, for which they earned sizable corporate tax deductions. As the US Pavilion's only de facto investors (Congress was not involved and individual Americans were not asked to participate), these corporations essentially owned the US Pavilion. Thus the US Pavilion's shopping-mall style.
SE 2010 did one thing right: it engaged the services of the PR firm Ruder Finn and ad agency Ogilvy & Mather, two of the world's most powerful press brand managers. Their services were worth every penny The mainstream press, when it covered the US Pavilion at all, was a lapdog, uncritically adulatory. Most Americans remained blissfully unaware of the Expo or the privatization and sell-off of the US Pavilion that traded on their name.
As required by law, Clinton finally appointed attorney Jose Villarreal as Commissioner General to oversee the US' privatized Shanghai Expo operations. Their authority was seriously undercut by the fact that almost all of the millions raised by Clinton had been spent before they arrived, in ways that still remain a secret.
To an experienced urban planner, it's all too familiar. The fix is in. Now try to fix it.
Hillary Clinton at Friday's opening ceremony for the US Pavilion
When the Expo opened on May 1, many chickens came home to roost.
At the Expo's "soft opening" last week, the US Pavilion was not ready. Its architecture received faint praise among architects. Its interior attractions remained to be completed. The vital US Online Pavilion, an Internet portal for the hundreds of millions of Expo fans who could not attend the Expo in person - the public face of the US Pavilion, America's online "brand" - an afterthought, was being farmed out to a Shanghai software developer. Reports that the staff and volunteers were working in problematic conditions amid managerial chaos provided scant assurance about things to come.
Now that the US Pavilion has been open for several days, its reviews, to be generous, are mixed. Visitors, after a two-hour wait, enjoy the upbeat attitude of the student "ambassadors" who greet them in Mandarin -- but few are impressed by the three films that constitute the US Pavilion's content. (One reporter noted that the price for the three shorts, about $23 million, is more than the production costs of the Oscar-winning film, The Hurt Locker.) The "American people's" sole walk-on are brief vignettes that flicker on the screen and then are gone. Chinese visitors are reported to have remarked, especially after the hype and long wait, "We expected more from America." Visitors exit the theater into a large hall dedicated to fawning over the 60-odd corporate sponsors whose names and brands are the only aspects of American life and culture to which the pavilion accords recognition.
As things stand, not much can be done to remedy the US Pavilion in Shanghai. Its construction is almost complete. Its team is largely on site. Its program of activities, such as it is, has been calendared. Most of those who will travel to Shanghai to visit the Expo, Chinese and foreigners, have already made their plans and reserved their seats.
But the future of American public diplomacy and how we deal with World Expos remains at stake. Here's what can and must be done...
My parents visited me and my boyfriend in Oakland a couple weeks ago and brought me a bag full of lemons from their tree in LA. They gave me a couple days notice so I would have time to prepare mentally for the onslaught of lemons that was about to enter my kitchen. First I made lemonade, and true to my grandmother I used their simple and easy ratio! It honestly makes the best lemonade with a perfect balance of sweetness and acidity.
Grandmother's Gold Coast Lemonade
1 c sugar
1 c lemon juice
4 c water
Mix all ingredients together and then refrigerate.
I next went about creating candied lemon peels like I made at work before Chez Panisse caught on fire. It is an interesting process of blanching and boiling in simple syrup which I will post as soon as I get the whole thing down to a science myself! But even after all these recipes and uses I still had tons of lemons in my house which were quickly going bad… and then I remembered a childhood favorite. Lemon Poppy Seed Muffins. This recipe is adapted from the goddess herself, Isa Chandra.
Lemon Poppy Seed Muffins
Makes 12 muffins
Time: 45 minutes
Ingredients:
Dry:
2 cups All Purpose Flour
2/3 cup sugar
1 Tablespoon Baking Powder
1 Tablespoon Poppy Seeds
1/2 tsp salt
Wet:
3/4 cup soy milk (or almond)
1/4 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice
1/2 cup canola
1 vanilla bean or 2 tsp vanilla extract
2 Tablespoons lemon zest
Glaze:
1 cup powdered sugar
2 Tablespoons milk alternative
1/4 tsp lemon zest
Method:
1. Preheat the oven to 375.
2. Combine all dry ingredients, taking care to sift the flour for maximum fluffiness.
3. Combine all wet ingredients.
4. Create a well and pour the wet ingredients with a fork into the dry ingredients until well combined taking care not to over mix.
5. Once combined use a spoon or ice cream scoop to fill each lined muffin mold in your pan.
6. Place in oven and bake for 23-27 min or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
7. Place on a rack to cool and after they have cooled slightly spoon the glaze on top. Garnish as you like, I used chopped candied lemon peel but feel free to leave as is.
Upcoming Frozen Goodness
Folks, we have a Nexus One. We also have Froyo. In fact, we have the two mixed together in the most delicious frozen-yogurty Android 2.2 kind of way you can imagine.
Not much has been officially released by Google about Android 2.2 - probably less than any other release to date. We all have a hunch about some new features but Google wouldn't officially confirm or deny any of them, other than the one about Flash 10.1.
They're saving it for May 19th-20th, and we're OK with that.
However, one of our team members has been playing with a Nexus One running Froyo for about a week now, getting more and more visibly excited every day.
Before we proceed, however, here's a quick picture to squelch any non-believers. These are not fakes and we will be playing with the phone on video very shortly.
Yes, it runs Flash, and it runs it very well (we'll demo that separately but you can get the idea here).
As you've seen it already, it has a new home screen menu but we won't talk about that today.
Froyo 2.2 Performance
Today, we would like to point out the results of some speed tests we've been running on Froyo, using a tool called Linpack.
These results are so impressive, most likely due to the introduction of the long awaited JIT compilation into the kernel, that we felt they deserved immediate attention.
Linpack
Linpack for Android was specifically created to test the performance of Dalvik VM which, in short, is the heart and the brains of Android.
The benchmark calculates how fast your phone can operate, which can then be used to compare various phone models' relative performance. Linpack allows users to publish these results to its online tracker, but we'll talk about that a bit later.
Here's a brief introduction to Linpack by the authors themselves, with interesting parts bolded:
The LINPACK Benchmarks are a measure of a system's floating point computing power. Introduced by Jack Dongarra, they measure how fast a computer solves a dense N by N system of linear equations Ax = b, which is a common task in engineering. The solution is obtained by Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting, with 2/3*N3 + 2*N2 floating point operations. The result is reported in Millions of FLoating-point Operations Per Second (MFLOP/s, sometimes simply called FLOPS). This test is more a reflection of the state of the Android Dalvik Virtual Machine than of the floating point performance of the underlying processor. Software written for an Android device is written using Java code that the Dalvik VM interprets at run time. What is the purpose of this app?
This is a simple benchmark test to show performance relative to other phones for a standard calculation. Linpack has been used for years on all types of computers, with a version used to rate the TOP500 computers in the world. What speed is better?
A higher number is better. Does having faster speed improve the android phones or what?
Yes, it should. The Dalvik VM has a huge impact on the Linpack number. A better number on the same device would indicate that a new version update has improved performance. Or it could show that something has gone terribly wrong if the number goes down.
But enough about Linpack - let's take a look at how Froyo performs.
Linpack Scores
Just so you have an idea of the kind of scores you can expect from the benchmark, let me list a few sample numbers:
the Nexus One running Android 2.1 gets about 6.5-7 MFLOPS
MFLOPS my HTC Hero averages a measly score of about 2 MFLOPS (the phone is pretty slow indeed)
Here is a screenshot of the last test I ran on the Hero:
Froyo Linpack Score
So how does the Nexus One with Froyo do?
A whopping 37.5 MFLOPS.
Think about this for a second. 37.6, compared to 6.5-7 - that's about a 450% speed improvement.
Conclusion
Things are starting to finally come together. Flash and huge performance gains, all in the same release. Flash is CPU hungry, so Android makes everything about the environment more efficient.
Do you see it? Adobe wasn't giving Apple what they needed, and Apple wasn't giving Adobe, well, anything.
But Google thought of the problem outside the box, like the ingenious engineers to the core that they are and made Android so much faster than it could finally run full Flash without a hitch.
Oh yeah, the phone is indeed noticeably faster.
Some of you (like Some of you (like Cyanogen and Uhhhh ) pointed out that JIT compilation only helps programs that are not compiled to native code, which Flash and some video codecs/drivers seem to be. Thank you for this clarification. While real-life improvements will most certainly not be 450% across the board, we still expect the N1 and even Flash to benefit from JIT because, as other programs become more efficient, more CPU will be available to such natively compiled programs.
These mysterious numbers from the Linpack Top 10 don't look so fake anymore now, do they?
Famed lawyer Alan Dershowitz said Sunday that liberals had a special obligation to condemn bigotry on the left side of the political spectrum, just as President Trump did for those on the right who claim to speak on their behalf.
"I don't want to make moral equivalence," Dershowitz told AM 970's John Catsimatidis, responding to a question about the Charlottesville violence and the ensuing national conversation around race relations and Confederate monuments. "But having said that, that doesn't give a pass to the people on the hard left, who are themselves engaged in violence and also some bigotry of their own."
They continued, saying Confederate statues needed to be put in context -- for example, in a museum -- rather than simply being destroyed.
Turning to the Russian probe, Dershowitz said that special counsel Robert Mueller was endangering democracy because the investigation could criminalize politics.
"The idea of trying to create crimes just because we disagree with (President Trump) politically and target them really endangers democracy," Dershowitz said. "We should only be using the criminal justice system against obvious crimes, crimes that are not stretched and manufactured to fit a particular person."
Congress ought to have appointed a special committee like it did in the aftermath of Sept. 11, Dershowitz said.
"To give it to a special counsel means it goes behind closed doors to a grand jury where people are not represented, where things happen in darkness and secrecy," they said. "We don't know what's going on. We get leaks, but the leaks are selective leaks. They shouldn't happen."
Dershowitz added that former FBI director James Comey was one of the worst leakers and slammed them for setting "a very bad" precedent for those working with classified information.
Last season the Raiders' offense was lost. They had an offensive coordinator who had a very specialized set of skills. They were a strict zone blocking specialist who wasn't known for their play calling abilities. They were asked to take their scheme and mold this team to fit that scheme. It had disastrous results.
Now, the Raiders have a new offensive coordinator on board so it is back to the drawing board. While they must figure out what kind of players they have to work with, the players must in turn figure out what they have in a coach. This is what we can expect.
1. Zone blocking is out
The offensive line never caught onto it last season. They had a great season in the power blocking scheme in 2011 and were unable to build upon that success. At some point last season they mixed in more power blocking and it helped Darren McFadden immensely.
What we will see instead are more gap and isolation schemes which will allow McFadden to run downhill as they do best. This kind of scheme is what had the undrafted Lagarrette Blount have a breakout season and Steven Jackson have the best seasons of their career.
2. Palmer to air it out
The Raiders led the league last season in yards after the catch. It sounds great but it was primarily because they very rarely attempted long passes. Olson worked with Drew Brees while at Purdue, helped Mark Bulger throw for 4301 yards with the Rams, and Josh Freeman have the best season of their career in 2010 (25 TD's to 6 int, 95.9 passer rating). They like their big armed pocket passers and that's what Carson Palmer is.
Out of the West Coast Offense last season, Palmer had one of their best seasons as far as passing yards are concerned. But it became clear that scoring was a serious issue. Yards don't mean much when it takes 60 passes to get them which eventually is going to result in an interception (or two) and drives often end in field goals. This offense should be more what Palmer was used to since entering the NFL.
Olson won't abandon the virtues of the WCO entirely but they also will not run it strictly. They preach play action though they don't always put it into practice.
3. Utilizing best weapons
It's hard to get a bead on some of the exact tendencies of their offenses because they were wholly dependent on personnel. In the seasons they had Kellen Winslow Jr at tight end in Tampa Bay, they called plays to get them the ball. When they had lesser talent at that position, tight end wasn't as big a part of the offense. When they had Steven Jackson in St Louis, they handed them the ball more often. When they had
What this tells us is a player like Marcel Reece won't be a ghost most of the season as they were last year. Reece is a playmaker and you can expect them to get the ball in their hands as much as we had come to expect in previous seasons.
4. Not run heavy
There was only one time in Olson's six seasons as an offensive coordinator they gave the ball to any running back more than 20 times per game. That was in 2006 when the Rams offense was one of the best in the league and there were plenty of touches to go around. Each season since then, the number of touches for the number one back has gone down. In their three seasons with the Buccaneers, the top back averaged right around 15 carries per game.
Fewer carries for McFadden will mean less wear and tear and less chance of injury (although I expect they will get injured anyway). The league is getting more pass happy and they are adapting with it.
This low amount of run plays isn't unlike last season. The difference will be the pass plays won't also reach into the 50's with the constant barrage of dink and dunk short passes.

Alex Salmond will spend their final six weeks as First Minister promoting education and political engagement for young people, they have announced.
Mr Salmond, who has faced opposition criticism for delaying the Scottish Government's legislative programme until after the election of their successor, has released a programme of engagements for their last six weeks in office.
They include a democratic initiative with Young Scot to hail the involvement and engagement of Scotland's young people during the referendum process, and a school visit to promote the Scottish Government's Schools for the Future building programme.
The First Minister will also attend an engagement to mark Scotland's commitment to free education and celebrate the contribution of its universities and colleges.
And they will make an appearance on an STV Appeal programme being screened live on Thursday night.
Announcements on Scotland's renewable energy potential and sporting legacy in the wake of the Commonwealth Games and Ryder Cup are also expected in the coming weeks.
Mr Salmond said: "Over the last seven years the Scottish Government have delivered key policies which have made a real difference to people's lives, and over the next six weeks I will be undertaking a series of engagements to help build on some of these key achievements.
"Our school building programme has been extraordinarily successful, providing the best learning environment for thousands of children by delivering new schools across Scotland despite Westminster austerity cuts.
"Scotland is an extraordinarily resource-rich country, and with the limited powers of the Scottish Parliament we have ensured that over half of our electricity is produced from renewables, and we are well on our way to making this 100% by 2020 - a process which has helped lay the foundations to reindustrialise Scotland.
"But the single biggest achievement is the Scottish Government's abolition of tuition fees. This has restored Scotland's long tradition of education being based on ability to learn - not the ability to pay - and I know that this policy is safe in the hands of all future SNP First Ministers.
"We entrusted young people with the vote during the referendum and that proved to be the right thing to do. Now we have a duty to maintain that momentum and ensure we capture the enthusiasm of our young people to be involved in the democratic process going forward.

MOSCOW (AP) — The wave of nationwide demonstrations that shook Russia's long dormant political scene over the weekend showed a new face of protest: mostly teenage demonstrators driven by accusations of high-level official corruption, glaring amid the nation's painful two-year recession.
A year before facing re-election, President Vladimir Putin has a dilemma: to further tighten the screws or to devise more artful means for keeping a lid on dissent. On Monday, a Moscow court handed a 15-day jail term to the protest organizer, Alexei Navalny, whose charisma and social media savvy helped rally the young.
Navalny was arrested as they walked to a protest in Moscow on Sunday and spent the night in jail before showing up in court. Police have arrested more than 1,000 people for taking part in the unauthorized protest in the capital, and many of them face jail sentences or fines. Navalny's anti-corruption foundation has promised to offer legal assistance to all those who were arrested.
“Even the slightest illusion of fair justice is absent here,” Navalny told reporters Monday from the defendant's bench, complaining about the judge striking down one motion after another. “Yesterday's events have shown that quite a large number of voters in Russia support the program of a candidate who stands for fighting corruption. These people demand political representation — and I strive to be their political representative.”
Journalists and well-wishers packed the courtroom in central Moscow, where Navalny, in a selfie posted on Twitter, declared: “A time will come when we'll put them (the authorities) on trial too — and that time it will be fair.”
The 40-year-old Navalny, Russia's most popular opposition leader, has had three convictions on fraud and embezzlement charges that they dismiss as politically motivated. Even though the convictions technically disqualify him, they have announced a presidential bid for 2018.
With their colorful and sarcastic expose of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's alleged collection of mansions, villas and vineyards — which garnered over 13 million views on YouTube — Navalny managed to draw tens of thousands to the streets across Russia in the biggest show of defiance since a 2011-2012 wave of protests rattled the Kremlin and led to harsh new laws aimed at suppressing dissent.
On Monday, Putin met with senior officers of the National Guard, which took part in arresting participants in the demonstrations along with police, but they didn't mention the protest. Russian state television completely ignored the demonstrations in their broadcasts on Sunday, and Medvedev refrained from comment.
“The question now is what kind of balance between propaganda and repression the government will choose,” said Andrei Kolesnikov, a political analyst with the Carnegie Moscow Center. “The government needs to preserve itself for another presidential term — if not forever — and now there is an important moment when the government is choosing its strategy and tactics.”
Medvedev's job had reportedly been in jeopardy amid infighting among various factions in the Kremlin, but now their tenure seems secure as their dismissal would look like caving in to protesters' demands — something Putin never does.
“He's protected by the very fact that they have become a target,” Kolesnikov said. “Firing them would amount to the recognition that people who took to the streets were right.”
The Kremlin has long sought to cast the opposition as a phenomenon of a privileged Westernized urban elite out of sync with broader layers of the population in Russia's far-flung regions. However, Sunday's protests engulfed many areas outside big cosmopolitan cities, a sign of spreading public discontent.
Teenage students made up a large share of protesters in Moscow and other cities — an unpleasant surprise for the Kremlin, which has hoped to boost support for Putin in the 2018 vote by attracting more young voters.
“It's a serious challenge for those who control the election campaign,” Kolesnikov said. “It's a signal that the most advanced part of the population wants changes.”
Political analyst Yekaterina Shulman said on Dozhd television that the strong participation by the young reflected their anger about the lack of career prospects in a society tainted by corruption and their abhorrence of state propaganda. In Russia's barren political landscape, Navalny is the only politician who appeals to the young, they said.
Artyom Chigadayev, an 18-year-old student, said they joined the protest in Yekaterinburg because of the allegations of Medvedev's amassed wealth, which they called “absolutely infernal.”
Yevgeny Roizman, the pro-reform mayor of Yekaterinburg, said the rally reflected public anger over corruption. “It's difficult to find sane people in any country who would be for corruption, so I think Yekaterinburg residents had all the reasons to come to the rally,” they said.
Asked about the fact that participants from across the vast country took part in Sunday's demonstrations, Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said, “the Kremlin is quite sober about the scale of yesterday's protests, and is not inclined to diminish them or push them out of proportion.”
Peskov assailed the organizers for putting people's lives at risk by encouraging them to take part in the unauthorized gatherings and defended the actions of Russia's riot police, which critics called heavy-handed.
On Monday, the European Union and the United States criticized the police crackdown and called on Russian authorities to release all those detained. White House press secretary Sean Spicer read a State Department statement calling the detentions “an affront to essential democratic values.”

Editor's note: The author is the US attorney for Julian Assange and WikiLeaks.
Last week, both the New York Times and the Guardian released editorials supporting clemency for NSA leaker Edward Snowden. Considering the important nature of Snowden's revelations, clemency is definitely in order – and it's about time that major outlets recognize that.
However, the focus on Snowden's singular case seriously deflects from the fact that the Obama administration has been a nightmare for whistleblowers and truth tellers, and that several others currently in prison or in exile deserve the same clemency or clear assurances they will not be prosecuted. So why is the media now calling for mercy for Edward Snowden, while other truth tellers including Chelsea Manning and Julian Assange, continue to face persecution (and prosecution)? If you apply the criteria established by both the New York Times and the Guardian to Manning and Assange – as well as other truth tellers including Jeremy Hammond, currently in prison serving a 10-year sentence after exposing corporate spy networks – a clear double standard emerges.
First and foremost, all of these truth tellers exposed or published documents exposing government misdeeds and crimes. All of the disclosures were of information that was valuable to the public debate of United States war tactics, intelligence gathering and privacy concerns, with no documentable damage to national security interests. For example, Chelsea Manning exposed American involvement in torture centers in Iraq, an unauthorized war in Yemen, and the so-called "collateral murder" of thousands of Iraqi citizens. Manning brought the "Collateral Murder" video and other documents to Wikileaks after going to people above them in the chain of command who refused to act. In fact, none of these truth tellers had another way to get this information out, which should afford them protections from prosecution.
Throughout Manning's case, it became clear that the government could not prove that their disclosures did any significant harm to national security. And yet this young soldier is still facing exorbitant time in prison, because the information they revealed casts a dark shadow on the United States' war tactics.
The "incredible value" that the New York Times and the Guardian ascribed to the Snowden leaks is clearly present in the Manning disclosures, which exposed the brutal and illegal nature of America's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Manning's disclosures opened up an entirely new public debate on the nature of modern war and diplomacy. And yet none of these other truth tellers have received the kind of public and media support that this set of editorials represents, perhaps because there is a fundamental difference between Manning's disclosures and Assange's publication of Wikileaks, when compared to Snowden's revelations on NSA intelligence gathering.
Manning and Assange exposed information pertaining to American activities abroad, actions that affected foreign nationals rather than American citizens. Americans are clearly outraged by the unprecedented level of surveillance they're being subjected to by their own government, which is perhaps why so many are now calling for a deal for Snowden. Nowhere near the same amount of public outrage has been mustered for Manning and Assange, whose disclosures mostly effect situations far from home. But this shouldn't excuse war crimes, or condemn those who tried to shine light on them. Instead, Manning, Assange and Hammond have all been subjected to unfair character assassination, resulting in ignominious imprisonment for Manning and Hammond, and the continued detention of Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where they remain isolated due to the knowledge that leaving will mean almost certain imprisonment in the United States.
But Manning, Assange, and Hammond all did their civic duty by disclosing information on government overreaching. They all exhibited great moral courage in doing so. And they all deserve far more than unfair imprisonment and exile for the service they have done for the American people and for people all around the world.
WASHINGTON -- After President Donald Trump's inauguration came the protest rallies and marches, which show no sign of abating. Now their supporters say it's time to show the nation that Trump and their agenda have loads of support.
They plan to demonstrate just that during "Spirit of America" rallies across the country Feb. 27 and March 4. Cleveland's rally is March 4.
"It's to demonstrate support for Donald Trump and the patriots of America," said Mark Skoda, a Cleveland native who's a leader in the Tennessee Tea Party movement, in a telephone interview.
"These rallies are inclusive, non-partisan, and open to anyone supporting President Trump in their efforts to bring back manufacturing jobs to America, put the security of our nation ahead of political correctness, improve our infrastructure, revitalize the inner cities and secure our nation's borders," said a statement from Debbie Dooley, a national co-founder of the Tea Party movement and an organizer of the Spirit of America rallies.
First came the anti-Trump marches
Breitbart News, a conservative website with ties to the Trump administration, first reported on the pro-Trump rallies. The primary group behind the rallies is Main Street Patriots, whose co-founder, Bedford resident Ralph King, was a Trump elector from Ohio. King also co-founded the Cleveland Tea Party.
But in a telephone interview with cleveland.com, King stressed that the rallies are not about specific sponsors or organizations. Although Trump held their own campaign-style rally in Florida on Saturday, the Spirit of America rallies have no direct tie with the White House or Trump's campaign organization, King said.
"Nope. It's not about them," they said. Rather, it's about the people who supported Trump showing their support for a president who is following through on their campaign promises.
"This is literally grassroots," King said. "Whether you're doing this with 1,000 people or you're doing this with a handful, get out there. That's what it's about."
Main Street Patriots list a 12:30 p.m. rally on March 4 in Voinovich Bicentennial Park in Cleveland. Others are listed in Cincinnati, Mansfield, Springfield, Jackson and Bridgeport. "There may be eight or nine for Ohio alone by the time we're done," King said.
Plans for many of the rallies are still shaping up. But organizers in Tennessee have announced a program and agenda for their Nashville rally March 4, including an appearance by an Ohio Tea Party leader, Tom Zawistowski of Portage County.
Zawistowski told cleveland.com that they are not one of the national organizers but was invited to join the rally in Nashville and expects it to be among the larger ones. "Everyone is just trying to do what they can do," they said.
Tom Zawistowki has found support where they didn't expect it
The goals at some rallies will go beyond showing support for Trump's agenda, which includes cutting federal interference with state and local affairs, building a wall on the Mexican border and preventing terrorism by restricting entry to the United States from seven majority-Muslim countries.
Promoters of the Tennessee rally, for example, are pushing for impeachment of the federal district judges in Washington state and Virginia who issued temporary court orders to halt Trump's visa ban. Skoda told cleveland.com that supporters "recognize that impeachment is a long haul."
Skoda told the Tennessee Star that the judges "expose an allegiance not to the Constitution to which they swore an oath to uphold, but instead to a Leftist ideology that is, in fact, anti-Constitutional."

The Ninth U.S Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld the temporary halt. That decision, too, was more about politics than law, Skoda told cleveland.com.
And a house at 664 Charlotte St. between Second and Third avenues is also slated to come down, according to documents filed with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.
The DEQ documents, called "notifications of intent to renovate/demolish," say demolition is expected to begin June 29 and end Aug. 31. All four buildings are owned by Olympia, the documents say.
According to CoStar Group Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based real estate information service:
the Hotel Ansonia was built in 1914 and has almost 17,000 square feet.
the Atlanta Apartments has 28 units and is about 28,000 square feet built in 1915
the building at 427 Henry St. was built in 1900 and has about 8,200 square feet
The house at 664 Charlotte St. between Second and Third avenues is 70 years old, according to a DEQ document.
"These long-vacant buildings have been considered by numerous residential developers and found to lack viable redevelopment potential," Ed Saenz, manager of communications and media for Olympia, said in a statement.
"Going forward, this area is envisioned for the type of high-density, mixed-use development that will contribute to Detroit's globally recognized comeback and create additional construction and construction-related jobs."
The Hotel Ansonia and Atlanta Apartments are not in a local historic district, although Detroit City Council member Raquel Castaneda-Lopez on Monday formally requested that the buildings be included on an interim basis in the Cass Avenue Local Historic District.
Each year, as a state law requires, the Wisconsin Department of Administration produces a “Contractual Services Purchasing Report.” It tracks spending by state agencies and the University of Wisconsin to outsource tasks ranging from information technology to janitorial work. State workers have long argued that they could be doing many of these jobs for less.
The latest report, for fiscal 2014, shows state agency spending on outside services is up for the fourth straight year. This has happened despite the Act 10 benefit changes under Gov. Scott Walker that arguably make state workers more cost-effective, compared to the private sector.
“During a time of alleged austerity, the administration continues to spend taxpayers' money like an inebriated sailor,” said Bill Franks, a retired state employee and union flight attendant who follows this issue. “You would have thought, if anything, those numbers would be going down.”
The new report was quietly released Dec. 22, more than two months past its statutory due date. Late filings are not uncommon, under both Republican Walker and their Democratic predecessor, Jim Doyle. One report from the Walker team was more than eight months late.
State agencies, the report shows, spent $451 million on outside services in fiscal 2014, which ended June 30. That's up 56 percent from fiscal 2010, before Walker became governor. During this same four-year period, the UW's spending on outside services declined nearly 11 percent, to $114 million.
State agency spending on outside services has been higher in the past. In 2003, it totaled $556 million. But this sum fell each year after that, to just $290 million in fiscal 2010.
DOA spokesperson Stephanie Marquis, to whom the governor's office referred questions, noted that Walker was governor for just half of fiscal 2011, which saw the largest increase. The rise in state agency spending is just 24 percent if this entire year is not counted.
“We prefer to use our own employees in providing services and programs to the taxpayers,” Marquis said in an email. But contractors are used when required by federal or state law, when necessary to maintain a license or warranty, when the state lacks infrastructure or expertise, or when contracting is “more efficient or cost-effective.”
The top state agency spender, by far, is the Department of Health Services, at $178 million in 2014. That's slightly higher than in 2011, when a Legislative Audit Bureau report questioned DHS's use of outside providers and urged it to “identify whether cost savings could be achieved by using state employees.”
DHS spokesperson Stephanie Smiley said the agency has had to continue using external contracted services to comply with Medicaid changes and the Affordable Care Act. But it “continues to review the efficacy of using contractors and will seek approval to convert contracted services to state positions to achieve cost savings when appropriate, as it has since the 2011 audit.”
The report summarizes the cost-benefit analyses required for each proposed state agency service procurement over $50,000. (The UW System is exempt from this rule.) It does not tally the numbers or say whether a given analysis led to a job being contracted out.
But a review by the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism shows the estimated cost of contracting was higher than the estimated cost of using state workers in 152 of the 250 analyses, as well as for the total sums.
According to the report, 75 percent of these cost-benefit analyses were for information technology services. It recommends agencies “continue to examine the availability of state employees” before contracting out for IT jobs. And it cites ongoing efforts “to reduce the state's use of contracted employees.”
This same language has appeared in past reports. Frank considers it “disingenuous,” not backed by political will. Actual progress in this direction, they said, “would mean doing something no administration wants to take credit for: increasing the size of state government.”
Share. The mega-retailer scores a rare and unique Pokémon promotion. The mega-retailer scores a rare and unique Pokémon promotion.
If you haven't yet picked up a copy of Pokémon X or Y – or if you've already finished one and are now thinking about buying the other version for a second runthrough – you may want to consider making your purchase at Walmart. The retailer has scored a rare exclusive distribution for a pair of special monsters, and it's only available through making new purchases of either edition.
If you decide to pick up Pokémon X, you'll find an unlock code inside for a special Garchomp. If you go with Pokémon Y instead, you'll be able to add a special Scizor to your in-game party. Garchomp and Scizor are two of the most popular Pokémon introduced in previous generations, and both monsters have gained renewed relevance in this latest sequel through the arrival of their new Mega Garchomp and Mega Scizor forms.
The nature of this promotion is rare, as Walmart doesn't often offer added in-game content as an incentive for video game purchases. And it's even rarer from the Pokémon side of the coin, as I personally can't remember a time before when an Event Pokémon distribution has been tied specifically to a new product purchase, rather than being made freely available for all fans. (If you can recall an example, let me know in the comments below.)
No word yet on what makes these Pokémon "special," either – if you pick up one of these Walmart copies and download the Scizor or Garchomp, let us know that too. Are they shiny? Are they holding a rare item?
We do know the deadline, though – this promotion will run until June 30 of next year.

Matt Ridley is a Conservative hereditary peer and journalist, who used to be best known for writing about genetics.  They are probably better known now for being the chairperson of Northern Rock bank at the time that it had to be bailed out by British taxpayers in 2007.
Ridley has also gained prominence for writing regularly about climate change, describing themselves as a “lukewarmer“. Their outlets include a weekly column in the Times, occasional columns in the Wall Street Journal, as well as a variety of magazine and broadcast appearances. In 2012, Rupert Murdoch, whose company owns the Times and Wall Street Journal, used their first-ever tweet to endorse a book written by Ridley.
Last week alone, their climate claims were published in the Sun (another Murdoch title), twice in the Times, the Wall Street Journal, Scientific American, as well as in the Spectator, a right-wing UK weekly magazine. They were also interviewed on BBC Radio 4's flagship current affairs Today programme.
Ridley often uses their position in the Lords to discuss the topics of climate change and energy policy. They sit on the Lords' science and technology committee and is an advisor to the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a UK-based climate sceptic lobby group.
In October, their earnings from the coal mining that takes place on their country estate in Northumberland made national headlines when anti-coal campaigners chained themselves to machinery in protest. Ridley has long had a statement on their website setting out their position on the income they receive from coal mining, but, to date, has refused to say how much they earn.
As part of a recent three-part documentary series called Changing Climate for BBC Radio 4, Roger Harrabin, the BBC's environment analyst, interviewed Matt Ridley, among a number of other people. The Open University has published many of the interviews online, both as recordings and full transcripts.
The Harrabin-Ridley transcript is arguably the most in-depth interview with the peer in the public domain on the topics of climate change and energy. Ridley makes a wide range of claims throughout, touching on subjects from ocean acidification and climate sensitivity through to energy subsidies and the “benefits” of global warming.
Recognising Ridley's media prominence and influence with regard to climate change, Carbon Brief recently sent a copy of the transcript to various scientists and energy policy experts and asked them to respond to their claims by annotating the document with their comments and observations.

As a youngster, I was often told that if I dug a hole deep enough, I would eventually find myself in China. I tried “digging a hole to China” a couple times, but I'd always give up as soon as my shovel would hit the bottom of the sandbox. Needless to say, I was not bright as a little boy.
Through the magic of the internets, we're now easily able to discover just where we'd pop out if we really dug a hole through the center of the Earth. This map is handy for finding out a rough approximation of the antipodal (opposite) point of any place in the world, while this one is better for a bit more precision.
So if you were to dig a hole to the exact opposite side of the Earth, would you really end up in China? Not unless you live in certain parts of Chile or Argentina. In my case, I'd need to bring my swimming trunks, and so would almost all residents of the continental US, as we'd end up in the Indian Ocean between southern Africa and Australia.
Somehow, the phrase “dig a hole to somewhere between southern Africa and Australia” just doesn't work.
But if you do dig a hole to China, you might expect to see….

Three weeks earlier, Cardinal Pell had received a report from an independent investigation by Howard Murray into Father Goodall. This advised them that the complaints of both men should be upheld, but Cardinal Pell's letter to Mr Jones directly contradicted that advice. Cardinal Pell did not respond last night. But Mr Jones told the Herald they believed Cardinal Pell should resign. "The apology that the Pope may give [to church abuse victims] has no meaning if the Archbishop of Sydney is still covering up sexual assaults," they said. "[Pell] assaulted me all over again through their lies. I had to live through these two sexual assaults through their lies."
Mr Jones, now a 54-year-old disability pensioner, was 29 and training as a teacher when Father Goodall assaulted them in a Sydney pool - and then again that night in a presbytery - in 1982. Cardinal Pell, in their letter to the other victim, acknowledged that Father Goodall had also engaged in "inappropriate behaviour" with altar boys. In 2005, Father Goodall pleaded guilty to two counts of indecently assaulting Mr Jones. They had also been charged with attempted buggery, but pleaded guilty only to indecent assault. They were sentenced under old laws which, at the time of the encounter, had banned even consensual sexual contact between men. The case was controversial for its retrospective use of the laws - and Father Goodall was given a token sentence of four seconds.
Mr Jones first complained to the church in the days after the assault. In 2002, they complained again, as did the other victim. The report into their complaints was delivered to Cardinal Pell a month before they wrote to the victims in 2003. Contrary to Cardinal Pell's claim to Mr Jones, the report did not indicate that Father Goodall "categorically denies the accusation". Nor did it recommend the two victims be dealt with in a different manner.
"Given the admission volunteered by Fr Goodall, it can be concluded that the allegations made by Tony and [Boy X] are sustained," Mr Murray, the independent assessor, wrote. They recommended "both Tony and [Boy X] be informed in writing that their allegations have been sustained". They found "Fr Goodall readily admitted to the behaviour complained of by Tony … They agreed that they had fondled Tony's penis without consent in the pool as a result of 'a physical attraction'." According to the report, Father Goodall agreed generally with Mr Jones's account of the events that then took place on a bed, although said it was "more consensual, than forced upon Tony". "He cannot recall whether they ejaculated, as alleged by Tony, but agreed it was likely," the report found.
In their letter to the other victim, Cardinal Pell accepted that they had been attacked by Father Goodall. "After examining all the material, Mr Murray provided me with a report in which they recommended that the complaints of inappropriate behaviour with altar boys and of indecent assault of you when a young boy be found to be substantiated." Mr Jones said the second victim validated their case beyond the technical issue of homosexuality.
The victims' support group Broken Rites called for Cardinal Pell to stand aside while the matter was investigated. Despite repeated requests, the Herald had received no response from Cardinal Pell at the time of publication. But early this morning Cardinal Pell issued a statement denying there was a cover-up or that they tried to mislead Mr Jones. "There was no attempt at a cover-up," they said. "The letter to Mr Jones was badly worded and a mistake - an attempt to inform them there was no other allegation of rape."
"However, I signed both letters of February 2003 mentioned in the ABC's Lateline program, and any fault in the drafting was mine. "The accusations against Father Goodall were investigated by the church and the police and Father Goodall was stood down.
"In a subsequent letter soon after the February 2003 letter I expressed my sorrow at what Mr Jones had suffered and offered to meet him. "There was no attempt to mislead him. I apologise for the confusion caused to Mr Jones."
The Aero Spacelines Pregnant Guppy was a large, wide-bodied cargo aircraft built in the United States and used for ferrying outsized cargo items, most notably NASA's components of the Apollo program.[1] The Pregnant Guppy was the first of the Guppy line of aircraft produced by Aero Spacelines.[1] The design also inspired similar designs such as the jet-powered Airbus Beluga, and the Boeing Dreamlifter.
Development [ edit ]
In 1960, U.S. airlines were disposing of their obsolete piston-engined Boeing 377 Stratocruisers in favor of the newer jet-engined airliners. NASA was finding that barge transport of their increasingly large space program components from manufacturers on the West Coast to test and launch sites on the East Coast was slow and expensive. Aircraft broker Leo Mansdorf was stockpiling surplus Stratocruisers at Van Nuys prior to resale, and ex-USAF pilot John M. Conroy realized the potential of these aircraft to transport the large but relatively light rocket components.[1]
Conroy presented their plans for an extensively modified Stratocruiser to NASA, where an official commented that the bloated aircraft resembled a pregnant guppy. Although NASA was lukewarm on the concept, Conroy mortgaged their house and founded Aero Spacelines International in order to build and operate the concept aircraft.[1]
Conversion work was undertaken by On Mark Engineering. The Pregnant Guppy (registered N1024V) was built from an ex-Pan Am airframe with a five-meter section from an ex-British Overseas Airways Corporation aircraft (G-AKGJ) added immediately behind the wing. The wing, engines, tail, nose and cockpit were unchanged, but a new upper fuselage of six meters diameter was added, giving the aircraft a "triple-bubble" appearance in front view. The entire rear section (including tail surfaces) was detachable to allow cargo to be loaded directly into the fuselage.
The aircraft first flew on September 19, 1962, piloted by Conroy and co-pilot Clay Lacy.[2] When Van Nuys traffic control realized that Conroy intended to take off, they notified police and fire departments to be on alert. However the huge aircraft performed flawlessly, the only difference in handling being a slight decrease in speed caused by extra drag of the larger fuselage.
Carrying the S-IV Saturn I rocket stage, the Guppy saved three weeks transit time versus barge,[3] for a cost of $16.00 per mile.[4]
Operational history [ edit ]
The Pregnant Guppy, with its tail removed, is loaded with a S-IV stage (1965)
In summer 1963, the Pregnant Guppy began flying NASA cargo. Among its early duties was transporting the first and second stages of the Gemini program's Titan II from the Martin Co. in Baltimore, Maryland to Cape Canaveral. As the space program grew through the late 1960s, it became clear that this one aircraft could not handle the whole transport load, and so 25 more Stratocruisers and ex-USAF C-97s were purchased to construct four Super Guppy aircraft, which were even longer and larger than the original.
The various Guppy aircraft served throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and beyond, initially transporting space components, and later, as NASA scaled down its operations after the success of the Apollo program, transporting airliner sections.[1]
The Pregnant Guppy was sold to American Jet Industries and registered N126AJ. It was broken up at Van Nuys in 1979.

Then they wanted it from this angle to get the whole Christmas tree and then that angle to capture the spire of the Empire State Building. Now I'm at a photo shoot. Five minutes later she's looking over all the pictures and asking me in poor in English why she's not smiling. I don't know lady! Fifteen minutes later, they let me go, dissatisfied and disappointed with me. I didn't need that.

My whole dating life seems like I've been waiting for the male species to catch up. Like once they get a degree or once he's settled in their career. But I'm 39 and the men I'm dating are around my age and it hasn't gotten better. At what age does it get easier?

The day before they die. I heard that second to last day is peaceful for all present.
I kid.
I kid.
*squints*
I'm not kidding.
My girlfriends all agree that ages two to 52 are just a black hole.
But I think there are sparks of light. Moments. Entire months even of when the planets align and things are just easy between the sexes.

Like when you're both nine. And he's still openly affectionate with their mom and unashamedly hands you a Be My Valentine card. That's a full school day.
Then there's the tender age of 15. He's open. He's unguarded. He's nice. He's started pacing their jerking off. They think they like you and tells you so. And you tell them you think you like them back. And the rest of the “relationship” exists mostly via furtive glances and phone calls. That's the entire spring term.
And then at some point, some careless girl, either you or someone like you, takes advantage of that niceness and breaks their heart and as the cherry on top, tells them they literally have the face of a baboon's ass and they stumble into their 20s still reeling. Now he's damaged goods and no good to anyone.

Daniela from Flint, MI asks:
My roommate is moving out at the beginning of the year. Them and their bf got a place together which is cool. What's not cool is the fact that they want me to either sell the furniture we bought together and split the proceeds, or have me buy them out. It'd be one thing if they wanted to split the furniture itself but they don't need any of it, not even their bed because they're using their bf's furnishings for the new place. Still I can't afford to buy them out but I don't see why I have to sell the sofa or dining table I need to put cash in their hand. And if I do get it sold, what am I supposed to do with less than half the money necessary for the things I need to refurnish the place?

Oh honey, have your Ikea Söderhamn sectional and Skogsta dining table officially appraised and give your ex-roommate their half of the $60, used Ikea furniture is worth.
This site does 3 appraisals for $35.
So this whole thing should set you back $65.
Now take that $65 and go buy a cash cannon, fill it up with real money and spray it all over the sofa and apartment, as she's packing up.

Daniesha from Marietta, GA asks:
My boyfriend always turns the TV on right after we have sex. We come home. We eat dinner. I turn off the TV. We have sex. And then when we're done, they turn the TV back on. Once I started noticing that they turned on the TV right after, every time, I couldn't un-notice it. Now it's driving me nuts and it's making me more and more insecure. Help!

I don't get it. It sounds like you two have a very established routine. I don't see what he's doing wrong. Seems to me like theirs hitting the power button is the period at the end of the banal sentence that is your sex life.
I mean if they didn't turn on the TV how else would you know it was over?
Or maybe he's watching TV to see how Groundhog's Day ended. So they too could break the cycle.

What sort of sex are you two having that they have the energy to catch up on the shows in their queue?
You're worried about them turning on the TV and I'm worried about ALL IT.
Your relationship is dying Daniesha!
Do something.
‘The fact that it's taken three months to get them here is just unacceptable,' Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young says
A 23-year-old asylum seeker who was allegedly raped on Nauru has been flown to Australia for medical treatment, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection has told a Senate inquiry.
Fronting the Senate inquiry into serious allegations of assaults, and conditions at the detention centre, the department secretary, Michael Pezullo, said the Iranian woman was en route by air ambulance to Australia for medical care after advice was received by the International Health and Medical Services, the contracted provider of medical care at the processing centre.
The request from IHMS came through on Wednesday and was approved immediately, a department spokesperson said.
The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said their information was that doctors were concerned about kidney failure.
Nauru authorities have been investigating claims the woman was assaulted on a nearby main road when returning to the centre after visiting friends while on day release, despite initially denying they had been raped.
A submission to the Moss review accused the Nauruan police of a series of failures to investigate sexual assault. No one has been charged over the alleged assault.
The woman's family has said they have self-harmed, has refused food and has been kept in a separate compound since the alleged attack.
Hanson-Young had previously accused the federal government of preventing the woman's transfer, which the department has denied.
The Greens' immigration spokesperson said they were glad the transfer had now taken place, but “the fact that it's taken three months to get them here is just unacceptable”.
They told the ABC on Friday morning the woman had waited 45 minutes after being found by police before being taken for medical care.
“The information that I was given at the time and has continued to be corroborated through evidence given to the parliamentary inquiry and through other sources, is that the police were watching the regular fireworks celebration while this poor young woman sat in the back of the police vehicle with nothing more than a blanket,” they told the AM program.
The Senate inquiry also questioned representatives from Wilson Security and a former guard who claimed asylum seekers had been waterboarded and cable-tied to beds.
The guard said they had not witnessed waterboarding but “what I firmly believe to be the actions after”.
Wilson Security denied those allegations, as well as others that the company had lied about the existence of a hotline for whistleblowers and drug and alcohol testing before July this year.
It also emerged that a fire during a 2013 disturbance at the centre had caused damage to the IT system, resulting in a six-month period with no central server, meaning records had been kept “ad hoc” by individual employees on their personal desktops.
At least one document – the “change of employment status” form for the senior Wilson Security guard who ordered the surveillance of Hanson-Young during their visit – was lost because of the interruption. The guard had been suspended on pay while the matter was investigated.
The Greens senator Scott Ludlam questioned what else went missing during that time, given Wilson Security had responded to various allegations by saying searches for evidence had turned up nothing.
You'll be surprised, but palm trees can be grown in state of Alaska. Many people believe that summer temperatures in Alaska are cool. In fact, like much of the United States, Alaska has four seasons. In the summer temperatures can reach into the 90°s and during winter fall below −60°F (-52°C).
With extreme temperatures like these, it is not surprising that Alaska's climate ranges from USDA Zone 1 to 7b. Alaska can offer an extremely wide variety of weather conditions depending on the zone. Alaska can be divided into five major zones: Southeast, South, West, Interior, and North.
Alaska Zones
Southeast
The climate in Juneau and the southeast panhandle is best described as a “cooler version of Seattle.” This is the warmest and the wettest part of Alaska. Winters are moist, long but only slightly cold with temperatures dropping to 20 °F (−6.7 °C) in January. Spring, summer, and fall are cool to mild, with highs peaking in July at 65 °F (18.3 °C).
South
The climate of Southcentral Alaska is mild. Temperatures range from an average high of 65°F in July to an average low of 10°F in December. It has short, cool summers and frequent strong southeast winds.
West
The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is. This area has a tremendous amount of variety, especially when considering precipitation.
Interior
The climate of the interior of Alaska is best described as extreme and is the best example of a true subarctic climate. The summers can have temperatures reaching into the 90s°F (near 34°C), while in the winter, the temperature can fall below −60°F (-52°C).
North
It is an Arctic climate with long, very cold winters and short, cool summers. Even in July, the average low temperature is barely above freezing in Barrow, at 34 °F (1 °C).
Growing Palm Trees in Alaska
Since Alaska has a wide range of climates and ranges from USDA Zone 1 to 7b, there are some extremely hardy palms that can survive there. One of those palms is Needle Palm Tree, that can survive cold temperatures down to -10F when mature enough. It is possible to grow Needle Palm in Zone 5. Some other cold hardy palms that can be grown in Zone 7 are:
When growing palms in cold zones, make sure to give them some cold protection. It can take only one bad winter to kill even cold hardiest palm.
Major Cities in Alaska
Anchorage – Hardiness Zone 4b
Fairbanks – Hardiness Zone 2a
Juneau – Hardiness Zone 7a

P.S. If you have any questions, leave me a comment below and I do my best to answer them as soon as I can.
Because Summerslam is turning 26 years old this summer here are some of my favorite Summerslam matches.
As we look back, we see that at the first Summerslam the main event was The Mega Powers vs The Mega Bucks in the build up after Wrestlemania IV in which Hulk Hogan and “Macho Man” Randy Savage were best friends facing Andre The Giant and “The Million Dollar Man” Ted DiBiase. It was an awesome way to highlight the first ever Summerslam Pay Per View, and continued our build towards Hogan vs Macho Man at Wrestlemania V. 26 years later, the WWE is a bigger monster than it was back then.
#26 Summerslam 88 The Mega Bucks vs The Mega Powers – As the first Summerslam you had four legends and three Hall of Famers (hopefully four soon with Randy Savage eventually being inducted) squaring off in the main event.
#25 SummerSlam 90 Demolition vs The Hart Foundation – The best two out of three falls match I had ever seen at that time.
#24 SummerSlam 91 Bret Hart vs Mr. Perfect
#23 SummerSlam 98 Stone Cold Steve Austin vs The Undertaker – It was Stone Cold in their prime and at their hottest and most over against The Undertaker. Enough said.
#22 SummerSlam 2000 Chris Jericho vs Chris Benoit
#21 SummerSlam 97 Bret Hart vs The Undertaker – We saw Shawn Michaels in the role of referee hit Undertaker with a steel chair, giving Bret Hart their fifth WWF World championship. It would cement Michaels as the number one heel and the beginning of the end for Hart in the WWF.
#20 SummerSlam 91 LOD vs The Nasty Boys
#19 SummerSlam 96 humankind vs The Undertaker – Mankind defeated the Undertaker in the very first and very well done Boiler Room Brawl.
#18 SummerSlam 95 Razor Ramon vs Shawn Michaels
#17 SummerSlam 93 The Steiner brothers vs The Heavenly Bodies
#16 SummerSlam 94 Bret Hart vs Owen Hart – The Old school, blue steel cage features prominently in this match that followed the classic between the brothers at Wrestlemania X.
#15 SummerSlam 2001 RVD vs Jeff Hardy
#14 SummerSlam 2002 The Rock vs Brock Lesnar – We saw The Rock pass the torch on that night in Uniondale and a star was born in new WWE champion Brock Lesnar.
#13 SummerSlam 1999 Stone Cold vs Triple H vs Mankind
#12 SummerSlam 2001 The Rock vs Booker T
#11 SummerSlam 88 Warrior vs Honky Tonk Man – Warrior ends the longest running Intercontinental Championship reign with a quick, dominating win, and a star is born.
#10 SummerSlam 2002 RVD vs Chris Benoit
#9 SummerSlam 2006 Ric Flair vs Mick Foley
#8 SummerSlam 2004 Randy Orton vs Chris Benoit – Orton becomes the youngest ever (at the time) WWE Champion.
#7 SummerSlam 2005 Hulk Hogan vs Shawn Michaels
#6 SummerSlam 2003 Brock Lesnar vs Kurt Angle
#5 SummerSlam 2001 Kurt Angle vs Stone Cold
#4 SummerSlam 92 Bret Hart vs The British Bulldog – A great match is the main event in Wembley Stadium and sees the Bulldog win the Intercontinental Title infront of their home fans.
#3 SummerSlam Macho Man vs Warrior
#2 SummerSlam 2000 Hardys vs Edge and Christian vs The Dudleys – The very first TLC match deserves its place on the list.
#1 SummerSlam 2002 Shawn Michaels vs Triple H – It was the return of HBK Shawn Michaels after four years away from the ring.
That's my list and my favorite top 26 Summerslam matches. Hope you enjoy.

As I watched Jennicet Gutiérrez open their mouth to interrupt President Obama's Pride Month reception address Wednesday night – because, they said, as an undocumented trans woman they couldn't celebrate while LGBT detainees are being abused in US detention centers – I thought, That could have been me.
I could see myself as a transgender US immigrant in a roomful of LGBT people, wanting to celebrate the president's actions to advance the cause of gay marriage, trans healthcare and trans people serving in the military, but being unable to shut my mouth because of the deplorable conditions that undocumented LGBT immigrants, especially trans women, face.
Trans women in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention are routinely housed with men and are either at enormous risk of sexual assault, sometimes by ICE guards themselves, or are placed in solitary confinement for months for their own “safety” – all after already enduring violence in their own countries that led them to seek asylum. So when Gutiérrez shouted, “President Obama, I am a trans woman. I'm tired of the abuse. I'm tired of the violence,” they were advocating for an issue that cuts to the heart of what it means for a person to be treated with basic human dignity, regardless of immigration status.
President Obama's response was bracing as it was heartless, especially being the child of one non-American himself. “Listen, you're in my house,” they said. And later: “I am just fine with a few hecklers, but not when I'm up in the house. You know what I mean? You know, my attitude is if you're eating the hors d'oeuvres – you know what I'm saying?”
Obama's argument seems to be that if you're invited to a party, it's only polite not to criticize the host; I try to follow this rule myself. But when the host is in charge of a system that leads to members of a community he's supposed to be celebrating being routinely abused and assaulted, and they have so far taken little action to address it, then breaking this rule is justified.
More than this, Obama's emphasis on defining the fine food and drink at the event as their property only serves to highlight the lack of dignity LGBT detainees endure simply through their accident of birth – that American society can shower resources on its citizens while leaving those who are attempting to enter the country in desperation without the most basic physical and psychological safety. And LGBT detainees merely represent the most extreme ways in which some people are treated unequally in the US.
Trans people, and especially trans women of color, have to endure all sorts of indignities in US institutions and broader society. Trans immigrants like me are especially vulnerable, as we endure the constant threat not only of being housed in male prisons – even as many of us are arrested simply for walking on the street – but also of travel restrictions when we cannot provide identification consistent with our gender, must endure harassment by government officials and live with the consistent threat of deportation (which applies even to legal residents).
The disparity in treatment of ICE detainees also highlights the enormous gap between the white, gay segment of the LGBT population and their trans people of color counterparts. The crowd at Obama's Pride Reception, consisting mostly of white men in suits, amplified the President's message by booing Gutiérrez and shouting Obama's name, enacting in real time the long, historical marginalization of trans women of color. It's been happening since at least the Stonewall Riots that ushered the modern LGBT movement, where organizers kicked out trans activist Sylvia Rivera, a founding member. For so many gay people today, LGBT advocacy stops at gay marriage, even as members of our community are routinely subject to harassment and violence, both in detention and outside.
In one of the videos of the incident Wednesday, a bystander could be heard shouting, “This is not for you. This is for all of us,” as though “all of us” doesn't actually include everyone – people like Gutierrez, or me are left out of that definition of “us”. The bystander could not have known what an enormous risk Gutiérrez took by daring to question the president of the country where they are an undocumented immigrant. And nevermind that they were careful to repeatedly say, “Release all LGBT prisoners from detention centers,” not just trans prisoners, or that she's advocating not for themselves but for people confined merely because they were so desperate to seek asylum from horrendous conditions in their home countries. The gay men at Obama's reception also seem to forget that their predecessors only 30 years ago needed to set aside good manners as they faced down Ronald Reagan about the AIDS crisis that was killing them in droves.
The circumstances may be different, but the desperation that drove Gutiérrez to speak is the same, and it is the same for anyone who sees other human beings treated inhumanely by a president and a government that has the ability and the power to do otherwise. In this sense, Gutiérrez was not acting for herself, for trans women or for the LGBT community, but for all of us. We all, at any moment, can find ourselves in a situation where we are robbed of our basic human dignity – even if, occasionally, we're invited to partake of powerful people's hors d'oeuvres.
Vogue Uses Yellowface To Prove Once Again They Don't Understand Diversity
After bragging and talking up their latest diversity issue, Vogue has once again proved they have no idea what diversity really is. In a spread titled “Spirited Away” (RED FLAG) supermodel Karlie Kloss was made up in yellowface, draped in stereotypical geisha garb, and photographed prancing alongside a sumo wrestler amidst scenery that is so stereotypically Japanese it hurts.
ADVERTISEMENT
The piece, shot by Mikael Jansson, was reportedly supposed to be “an homage to a 1966 Vogue shoot by Richard Avedon of German model Veruschka,” according to People magazine. Kloss apologized on Twitter today, saying they would ensure their future photo shoots were more culturally sensitive.
This is not the first time that Vogue has leaped over the line of cultural appropriation. Vogue Paris featured a spread in 2009 of white models in black face. In 2013, Vogue Netherlands also featured a white model in blackface and textured wigs, supposedly as a tribute to Josephine Baker. In 2014, Vogue Italia featured white models wearing red and “tribal” makeup posing next to various African animals. You'd think they learned their lesson but alas, the fashion world seems to be even less progressive than we all thought.
Reflecting on the nonsense that was Vogue's Japanese spread in their supposed “diversity” issue, popular blogger Angry Asian Man wrote: “Kind of silly, pointless celebration if you're going to turn the page and find this yellowface geishapalooza inside. And did nobody even consider hiring an actual Asian model? So much for that 'diversity' nonsense.”

Come On, Kylie Jenner! It's 2016, Can You Stop With The Cultural Appropriation?
Researchers at Stanford University have identified enzymes that could make it easier to produce the anticancer drug etoposide (Science 2015, DOI: 10.1126/science.aac7202). Etoposide is currently synthesized from podophyllotoxin, a natural product first isolated from the Himalayan mayapple plant, Podophyllum hexandrum.
“Podophyllum is not an easy plant to cultivate and grow,” says Elizabeth S. Sattely, who led the study. “It's a challenge to sustainably grow the plant to get enough compound.”
Such difficulties could be avoided by producing an etoposide precursor in a different, easier-to-handle organism. Sattely and grad student Warren Lau have now identified the enzymes in the mayapple plant that could enable such a move.
The pathway comprises 10 genes, four of which were already known. Sattely and Lau found the other six genes by searching the RNA produced by wounded mayapple plants, which make extra deoxypodophyllo­toxin, a proposed podophyllotoxin precursor, in response to being wounded. The team used bacterial plasmids to transfer the pathway into Nicotiana benthamiana, a wild relative of tobacco plants that's easy to grow.
The pathway the researchers assembled has an unexpected bonus. It contains two enzymes that convert deoxypodophyllotoxin into the etoposide aglycone, which differs from etoposide only in that it lacks a disaccharide group. The aglycone also requires fewer steps to convert into etoposide than does podophyllotoxin.
Currently, the engineered tobacco plants produce only nanogram amounts of the etoposide precursor. Although they think the task will be challenging, Sattely plans to engineer the new pathway into yeast, a prolific microorganism, to improve the yield.
I'm going to do a detour from German soccer for a post to write about a place I've grown up in: Camden Yards. I'm from central Maryland, about a half hour south of Baltimore. I spent far too much time in Baltimore growing up, mostly going between surgeries and checkups at John's Hopkins. But if there was one thing that made me cheer up all these years, it was the Orioles.
I've been going to games for as long as I can remember. I went to games during The Streak, when they were good in the 90's, and even during the years in the loss column between 2nd grade and halfway through college. I got red in the face watching Brady Anderson striking out on Cal Ripken's final game, with Cal in the on deck circle, and when Camden Yards became Fenway and Yankee South last decade. And of course I have been there with the new-found success and postseason heartache. Throughout it all I stuck by the Birds.
But Wednesday was different for all of us in Birdland. We couldn't stand by our O's at The Yard. No one could. The game was played behind closed doors; the first Major League Baseball game to ever be played without a paying crowd.
For anyone who is reading this, you probably know the reason why. But just in case you weren't sure, here it is in a nutshell: there were days of protests in Baltimore in April surrounding the death of Freddie Gray in police custody. Gray suffered spinal cord injuries The protests reached Camden Yards on Saturday for the game against the Boston Red Sox. There were some scuffles outside between protesters and fans, and riot police were used to keep protesters from entering the game. Fans were prevented from leaving for a half hour when the ninth inning started due to the protests. It got worse on Monday, with widespread looting, a CVS burned after everything was taken, and just downright chaos. After that night, a state of emergency was declared and a curfew for all in the city.
With all the insanity surrounding Camden Yards, the games on Monday and Tuesday against the Chicago White Sox were postponed. And then came the announcement that the game on Wednesday would be played without a single fan in the camden green seats five hours early.
Once that announcement rang out, I knew I had to see it to believe it.
I couldn't make it to Baltimore until the 7th inning due to work. I drove up to Camden Yards and saw the lights on in the middle of the day, but the seats were bare. I drove along the left field foul line and didn't see anyone walking around in the concourses. All the food stands were shuttered. No fans in Orioles cap, jerseys, t-shirts, anything. But there was a group gathered outside on the fence by one of the main entrances. I parked a couple of blocks away and joined in.
There were about 100 fans hanging out behind left-center field. We were about 600 feet from home plate, and could actually see it! We could see the pitcher throwing balls and strikes, the bases and left-center field. But that was all we could see. We had to see the reaction of the batter before we could tell what happened in left or right field. But to us it didn't matter. We could still see our O's leading the White Sox 8-2.
I got there in time for the 7th inning stretch. We kinda sang “Take me out to the Ballgame” but definitely took part in the stretch staple “Thank God I'm a Country Boy.” There was dancing, singing, and an all around good time. We brought the atmosphere from beyond the fence. If we couldn't be a part of the game in Camden Yards, we'll just do our thing as close as we can, hon, even with the police helicopters flying all over the city.
We didn't need a scoreboard to tell us to cheer or chant, we did it ourselves. “Let's go O's!” was the big cheer of the day. We kept it up until we finally won 8-2. High fives and cheers rang out.
One of Baltimore's sports radio personalities, Steve Davis ran out to see us after the game. They said everyone in the press box could hear us. We already knew that since someone brought a radio and the announcers told us to yell if we were out there. We did. A Washington, DC reporter came and talked to us next and we all got on TV.
I gotta say, I know people rag on this city a lot. Murdermore and Bodyland are a couple of nicknames that the city has earned over the years. And I get it. You have to run through some of the rough spots to get to John's Hopkins. After every Oriole and Ravens game you run into homeless beggars asking for change. It can dampen the good mood after a win or make you sulk more after a loss. The Wire is an accurate portrayal of the drug trade not just in Baltimore, but in the United States as a whole. But after Wednesday I realized how much I loved Baltimore, warts and all. Baltimore is coming together in the wake of the protests and riots. Baltimore will overcome.
I may be moving to Germany in the future to cover German soccer, but I'm never going to forget where I come from. Let's go O's. Let's go Baltimore.

New Jersey Devils defenseman Jon Merrill underwent successful shoulder surgery on Monday, the team announced Wednesday.  They are expected to be sidelined four months.
"This past Monday, Jon Merrill underwent successful surgery on their right shoulder," Devils General Manager Ray Shero said in a release. "The procedure was performed at the Midtown Surgical Center in New York City by the club's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Jonathan L. Glashow. Their expected recovery time is approximately four months."
RELATED: Patrik Elias, Cory Schneider undergo successful surgery
Merrill had their season cut short by the shoulder injury, missing the final 10 games of the season after last playing on March 19. Merrill also missed more than a month in January and February with an arm injury. The 24-year-old defenseman played in 47 games last season.
Merrill will also be a restricted free agent this summer following the end of their three-year contract.
A four-month recovery period would put Merrill's return just before the start of the regular season.

TUCUMCARI – A Tucumcari man's five-year effort to be exonerated of charges for having an open container of O'Doul's non-alcoholic beer in their car ran into a procedural hurdle Tuesday in 10th District Court.
Judge Albert Mitchell threw out Gary Southern's motion to have their conviction for having an open container of an alcoholic beverage in their car set aside because it was based on a writ of coram nobis, a procedural device that has been abolished in New Mexico courts.
A writ of coram nobis would allow a court decision to be thrown out in some cases if it is based on an error in fact.
ADVERTISEMENTSkip
Mitchell then advised Southern that they had two options: They could appeal Mitchell's decision of Tuesday or file a motion for a writ of habeus corpus with the court.
A writ of habeus corpus orders that a person who has been denied a liberty be brought before a court. It places the burden of proof on those denying that person liberty to justify that denial, according to statute books.
Southern, who is acting as their own attorney, said they are going to start on a new writ of habeus corpus.
Southern's difficulty started in 2008 when a Tucumcari police officer pulled them over after observing Southern making improper lane crossings when negotiating a turn, records show.
The officer, identified as L.P. Emilio, noticed the open container of O'Doul's and another open empty O'Doul's container in the car, records show. Southern told the officer that they were drinking the O'Doul's, and the officer charged Southern with having an open container of an alcoholic beverage in the car, a criminal offense under state law. They were found guilty before Municipal Judge Joe Dominguez.
Since then, Southern has made several attempts to have their case re-heard. All have been thrown out on procedural grounds, court records show.
ADVERTISEMENTSkip
Southern has represented themselves in all the subsequent proceedings.
The definition of “alcoholic beverage” in New Mexico statutes states that an alcoholic beverage is one “containing more than one-half percent alcohol.”
According to an O'Doul's label, the beverage contains less than one-half percent alcohol.
According to state statute, no one who is in motor vehicle shall knowingly have “in their possession or on their person … any bottle, can or other receptacle containing any alcoholic beverage that has been opened or had it seal broken or the contents of which have been partially removed” in the area occupied by driver and passengers.
Southern contends since O'Doul's contains less than one-half of 1 percent alcohol, it does not meet the statutory definition of “alcoholic beverage,” and its presence in an open container in an occupied passenger compartment would seem not to violate state law.
Ralph Towner: An Old Hand With A 'Foolish Heart' (And An Unmatched Style)
Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of the artist Courtesy of the artist
Ralph Towner first came to the attention of a wide audience nearly 50 years ago as a member of the Paul Winter Consort, for whom they composed the group's most famous tune, "Icarus." The piece was so beloved, the Apollo 15 astronauts took the record to the moon — and named a crater after it.
Today, Towner is in their 70s and still going strong. He's best known as an acoustic guitarist, and was born in Washington state. But they grew up a piano prodigy in a town in Oregon.
"Nobody knew what to do with me," Towner says. "Had I lived on the East Coast, I think I might have been immediately sent to a music school very early. But as it was, I had a sort of simplistic childhood — kind of Norman Rockwell style."
That bucolic young life came with a soundtrack: Their father played trumpet and their mother was a piano teacher.
"I would go to this old piano that we had and, in the beginning, I would just hold down the pedal and hit something and let it ring," they say. "I remember just being enthralled with hearing this chord sustain and then slowly disappear."
"He already came into this life with a level of talent that many people don't have," Gary Peacock says, and they would know: He's Keith Jarrett's bass player, a composer in their own right and a longtime collaborator of Towner's. They say the latter has a talent few possess.
"Ralph has incredible ears," Peacock says. "I remember on a tour one time, I walked into their dressing room just to see if everything's OK ... and he's playing three notes on their guitar, over and over again. And then maybe adding something, over and over and over. Anybody walking by would think, 'What is they doing?!' What he's doing is listening. Listening to what is there and, now, what comes next."
Towner began playing piano when they were 3, and took up trumpet two years later. They wound up at the University of Oregon studying art, before eventually switching to music composition. It was there that they first heard a record by a musician who would become one of their biggest influences: pianist Bill Evans and their legendary trio.
"I always wanted to record 'My Foolish Heart,' " Towner says. "It's one of the first tunes I'd heard that combination of Evans, [Scott] LaFaro and Paul Motian play. So that tune had a lot of meaning for me and was very important for me starting out as a jazz musician." Towner finally recorded it for their latest album, which is also called My Foolish Heart.
It was also at college that Towner first heard a classical guitar. "I never was really attracted to the guitar until I heard a classical guitar," they say. "For me it's like a small piano in what you can do with it, in terms of moving secondary voices around in your music. You can play all these notes with all the fingers of your right hand."
Towner has developed an instantly recognizable style, one that sounds like he's playing with all 10 fingers of both hands — conjuring melody, harmony and rhythm almost simultaneously. Woodwind player Paul McCandless, who has been collaborating with Towner for nearly half a century, explains it this way: "You hear the bass, you hear the chords, you hear the melody. The illusion is created that there's a whole ensemble playing — a whole world that they create just with the guitar."
Towner and McCandless' partnership began in the Paul Winter Consort and continued in the group that split off from the Consort, Oregon. Towner has been Oregon's primary composer since the beginning, and the classically trained McCandless says there's a reason.
"These pieces that Ralph created — I always say that if you change one note, it wouldn't be as good ... [similar to] the way Mozart and their music are irreducible," they say. "I think that Ralph's gift for melody, and singable melodies, really transport the listener to another world."
Towner just turned 77, and the history behind their new album brings that tune they heard Bill Evans play all those years ago up to the present.
"There's a little irony in it, since I just had a pacemaker put in about two years ago," they chuckle. "We had a concert in Germany and, uh, I fell on my face on the first sound check and had to go to the hospital; I'd kind of blacked out. Turns out that my heart was beating so slow. And so I called the whole CD My Foolish Heart. I hope it's over its foolishness!"
So do their fans.

This is the first post in a RWW series on the reemergence of the anti-choice “personhood” movement and what it means for the future of abortion rights in the U.S.
Part 2: The Personhood Movement: Internal Battles Go Public
Part 3: The Personhood Movement: Undermining Roe In The Courts
Part 4: The Personhood Movement: Regrouping After Defeat
“Welcome to the future of the pro-life movement.”
As a few dozen activists walked into a conference hall in an Atlanta suburb in October 2014, they were met with an optimistic greeting from an impromptu welcoming committee.
It was the founding convention of the Personhood Alliance, an association of anti-abortion groups from 15 states who are determined to wrest back an anti-choice movement that they fear has gone dangerously astray.
The members of the Personhood Alliance felt betrayed.
The largest and best-funded groups opposing abortion rights have, over the past several years, achieved astounding success in chipping away at women's access to legal abortion in the United States. But these successes, Personhood Alliance's founders maintain, are too small and have come at a grave cost.
In seeking mainstream approval for anti-choice politics, personhood advocates believe, groups like the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) and Americans United for Life (AUL) have adopted a secular tone and downplayed their Christian origins. In focusing on drawing attention to issues like late-term abortion, they may have won some support for the cause but have done little to end the procedures they targeted. In seeking incremental successes, personhood advocates argue, the movement has given up on making a moral argument for the humanity of fertilized eggs and fetuses and lost sight of its larger goal of eliminating legal abortion entirely.
But the greatest betrayal in the eyes of these personhood advocates is the willingness of major anti-choice groups to endorse legislation that includes exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest. The personhood movement's leaders contend that these political concessions are not only immoral and intellectually inconsistent, but also threaten to undermine the movement's goals in the long term. In fact, the Personhood Alliance grew out of a feud between Georgia Right to Life leader Daniel Becker and NRLC centered around a rape exception inserted into a national 20-week abortion ban. Becker and their allies believe that they have a better plan, one that does not require compromise.
Joining the activists at the founding conference was Ben DuPré, the chief of staff for Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, who, along with their colleague Justice Tom Parker, has outlined an alternate strategy for eliminating legal protections for abortions in the United States: building a body of laws that define fertilized zygotes and fetuses as citizens with full rights under the law.
On the first night of the Personhood Alliance's founding convention in October, Paul Broun, then a Republican member of congress from Georgia, captured the activists' anger at the leaders of the anti-choice movement, charging that they had betrayed the movement's core principles to such a degree that it had provoked the wrath of God — and implied that they were doing so for personal gain.
Broun told the activists of a meeting they had had with two leaders of NRLC when they were running for U.S. Congress in 1996. They told them that were they elected, the first bill they would introduce would be a Sanctity of Human Life Act giving personhood rights to fertilized eggs, because [that's] “how we're going to overturn Roe v. Wade is by giving the right of personhood to that one-celled human being.” The NRLC leaders, Broun said, told them they wouldn't support it and they “walked away very disillusioned.”
When an audience member asked Broun why they thought NRLC and other major anti-choice groups weren't putting their energy behind personhood bills, including one that they helped write, Broun responded that they aren't “making any accusations here,” but implied that “pro-life” leaders have a financial incentive to never achieve their declared goal.
Harkening back to that 1996 meeting, they drew a historical parallel:
They never told me [why they wouldn't back the Sanctity of Human Life Act]. I asked them, and they just said, well, we won't. And I walked away from that meeting in 1996 very, very disappointed, very disillusioned. And shortly after, actually as I was riding away in a taxi cab, it came to mind, back when I was a kid – looking around the room, I'm not sure anybody's old enough to remember polio – but when I was a kid I had classmates who got polio who were in iron lungs, and I had patients as a doctor, people who when I was in medical school, were people who had polio. The biggest charity in this country was an organization called March of Dimes. And they were, their executives were, I guess, I'm not sure, but they were making lots of money, March of Dimes was probably the biggest charity in the country. And a doctor by the name of Jonas Salk developed a vaccine. And suddenly, March of Dimes went broke. And I went away from that meeting with National Right to Life and I was wondering, I still wonder, I'm not making any accusations here: If we were to stop abortion, what would happen to the jobs of all those people who are getting paid every day to be in the pro-life movement? What would happen? I don't know if that's what it is or not, I'm not making any accusations, I'm just telling you what my thought was when I left that meeting.
They told the Personhood Alliance that every day that legal abortion continues, America risks God's wrath. Discussing their 2013 refusal to vote for a 20-week ban to which the House GOP had added a rape exception at the last minute, Broun said:
If we can save some, let's do it, but let's not make exceptions and that some babies are worth killing and some are not. They're all worth saving. And then it goes back to ‘my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge,' as we hear [from] Hosea 4:6, and that's the reason education is so important. Because we've got to educate the grassroots. … You see, God is a holy, righteous God. They cannot continue to bless America while we're killing over a million babies every single day. Abortion must stop.
(Broun's estimate of one million abortions taking place every day is, to say the least, wildly exaggerated.)
Broun argued that groups like the NRLC are selling the movement short by accepting political compromise bills containing rape and incest exceptions and then pressuring anti-choice lawmakers to vote for those bills.
“The reason a lot of pro-life people are willing to compromise is because of that outside pressure,” they said. “Whether it's an endorsement from Concerned Women [for America] or the Family Research Council or another group, or it could be an endorsement of the U.S. Chamber [of Commerce] or it could be the endorsement of any group. Politicians, the major principle that they will not budge from is their reelection. So they will do whatever it takes to get the endorsements, the money that they need to raise.”
Barry Loudermilk, a former Georgia Republican state senator who had recently been elected to the U.S. House, also spoke to the convention, comparing the fight against abortion rights to the struggle of America's founders, who they said also witnessed “a decline in the moral sensitivity of our nation.” Loudermilk, who while serving in the state senate introduced a personhood amendment that was backed by Georgia Right to Life and Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, said, “When you look at our movement, we have the exact same things against us that they had against them,” they said. “They had the government against them, the laws, the judges. We don't have the people who are totally with us, it's growing. But we have the truth with us. We have Providence with us.”
The members of congress echoed a founding tenet of the Personhood Alliance: that in a movement that was increasingly struggling to appear secular, the organization would be unabashedly “Christ-centered” and “biblically informed.”
As personhood's proponents like to remind their fellow activists, both sides of the movement share the same goal: to completely criminalize abortion. The question is just how to do it.
The largest and best-funded anti-choice groups, deploying a strategy of chipping away at abortion access in the name of “women's health,” have pushed state legislatures to pass over 200 new restrictions on abortion rights since 2011, many based on model legislation from AUL and NRLC. This strategy has managed to shut down abortion providers (especially in rural areas), make it harder for low-income women to pay for abortion, and erect unnecessary logistical hurdles for even those women who could access and afford abortion care.
The movement also won a pivotal court case with the Supreme Court's ruled that private corporations could deny their employees legally mandated health insurance coverage for contraceptives that the corporations' owners believe cause abortion. And they did this all while stemming the loss in public opinion that had hindered other “culture war” issues, in part by lifting up female leaders and adopting woman-centered empowerment rhetoric.
But at the same time, another side of the anti-choice movement, those eschewing compromise and incrementalism and pursuing the goal of establishing legal “personhood” from the moment of conception, have suffered a series of embarrassing electoral blows. In 2014, Colorado voters overwhelmingly rejected a ballot measure that would have defined zygotes and fetuses as persons in the state's criminal code. It was the third time in six years that voters in the state had rejected a “personhood” measure, although its proponents noted that their margin of defeat got smaller each time. Perhaps even more galling for the movement, voters in reliably conservative North Dakota rejected an amendment to provide constitutional protections for “every being at every stage of development” by a whopping 28-point margin. And this all came three years after a personhood initiative was soundly defeated in deep-red Mississippi.
These personhood measures, while sharing the same ultimate goal as the incremental strategy, have become widely seen as politically toxic, in large part because they could threaten access to common forms of birth control. The no-compromise strategy has also become tied to a series of ham-handed comments made by male politicians, most infamously former Missouri Rep. Todd Akin, which further hurt the personhood movement, while providing political cover to those pursuing a more incremental approach.
But despite its spectacular losses at the ballot box, personhood movement strategists maintain that not only is their strategy the morally sound and intellectually consistent one — they believe their strategy is the one that will ultimately swing public opinion and overturn Roe v. Wade.
This series, marking the anniversary of Roe, will explore the recent resurgence of the personhood movement and what it means for the future of abortion rights. Upcoming posts will examine the history of the split in the anti-choice movement and its debates over legal strategy, and the organizations that are currently leading the movement.
Ether Rock - Pet Rocks On The Blockchain
Welcome to the latest revolution in CryptoCurrency and blockchain technology! Ether Rock allows you to collect and trade virtual rocks, all in a slightly different shade of grey -- an idea that we expect to disrupt the multi-billion dollar crypto industry! Only 100 rocks will ever be available, and each new virgin rock gets more and more expensive. This game is built entirely on the Ethereum blockchain, with a decentralized smart contract (deployed here) used to manage everything including the buying and selling of rocks, their prices and owners (though this website is still necessary so you can see pretty pictures of the rocks).
These virtual rocks serve NO PURPOSE beyond being able to be brought and sold, and giving you a strong sense of pride in being an owner of 1 of the only 100 rocks in the game :)
How to play: you must be connected to the Ethereum mainnet to view info on rocks, and some Ether (the currency of Ethereum) to buy a rock. The easiest way to connect to the Ethereum mainnet is to use the MetaMask plugin for Chrome -- go ahead and install it (takes 1 minute), then refresh this page. To get Ether you will need to buy some from an exchange like Coinbase.

Gustavo Dudamel reveals debut album with Berlin Philharmonic
Marking the 150th anniversary of Richard Strauss' birthday in 2014, the conductor's latest recording features some of the composer's best-known works.
Conductor Gustavo Dudamel has announced their debut album with the Berlin Philharmonic, set for release in September this year. It will feature Strauss' epic Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which rose to wider public consciousness after being featured in 2001: A Space Odyssey, as well as Don Juan and Till Eulenspiegel.
The recording was captured during concerts in 2012 and 2013, and marks an important release in the label's history. Dudamel is following in the footsteps of legendary conductor Herbert von Karajan, whose benchmark Strauss recordings are still highly esteemed by classical musicians across the world.
"Performing Zarathustra with the Berlin Philharmonic has been an honour, first and foremost, as well as an amazing and unique challenge," said Dudamel. "As soon as you think of Zarathustra, you think of the Berlin Philharmonic, and of Karajan – there's a direct relationship between them."
They added: "I think we've achieved something very special in our live recording, which I see as a key moment in my life – one of those peaks you dream of, something you might think was an impossible dream, but which then comes true."
Such animals are believed to be responsible for more than half of the country's greenhouse gases, causing huge environmental problems.
But Phil Goff, New Zealand's trade minister, told an Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) in Paris yesterday that a solution was in sight.
"Our agricultural research organisation just last week was able to map the genome ... that causes methane in ruminant animals and we believe we can vaccinate against" flatulent emissions, Mr Goff said.
Scientists in New Zealand have been working around-the-clock to reduce emissions from agriculture, such as changing the way fertilisers are used on pasture land, Mr Goff added.
Sheep, cattle, goats and deer produce large quantities of gas through belching and flatulence, as their multiple stomachs digest grass.
Ruminants are responsible for about 25 per cent of the methane produced in Britain, but in countries with a large agricultural sector, the proportion is much higher.
The 45 million sheep and 10 million cattle in New Zealand burped and farted about 90 percent of that country's methane emissions, according to government figures.
In comparison, livestock are responsible for about two per cent of the United States's greenhouse gas emissions, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.
Under the Kyoto Protocol to combat global warming, New Zealand must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.
In the past New Zealand's farmers have showed their disgust at government plans to impose an animal "flatulence tax" by sending parcels of manure to members of parliament.
The OECD conference is discussing climate change, trade and the global economy.
Back in March we first reported on how multi-window functionality had been discovered in an Android code commit. While many custom ROMs and OEM skins have had multi-window capabilities for a while, stock Android fans have been long been waiting for such a feature. The good news is that Android M does in fact carry such a function!
Before you get too excited, there's some bad news, too. First, this is an EXTREMELY early, experimental function. It's so experimental that you can't just turn it on in developer options, you first have to edit your build.prop to change user type to “userdebug” before the feature even shows up in dev options.
Want to dive even deeper? Check out our full “Diving into M” series by clicking here.
As you can see in the screenshots at the top of the page, the multi-window mode gives you the power to show two windows side-by-side. You control this functionality through the recent menu by clicking on a new icon that shows up to the left of the (X). Once you do that, you'll be asked to select the task's layout. Although the feature seems a bit clunky, it works just fine as far as I can tell and I've had no problems with crashing or other issues while playing around with it. I'm currently testing this on a Nexus 5 though, and so it's a bit cramped, but obviously such a feature is a much better fit for tablets or big-screen phones.
Multi-window is certainly one of the things we've long been asking for, but considering the hoops that must be crossed to turn this on, we wouldn't bet on this coming to Android M as a stable (non-dev) feature. Then again, you never know. What do you think of Android M's new multi-window function? Let us know in the comments.
The origin of water on Earth , or the reason that there is clearly more liquid water on Earth than on the other rocky planets of the Solar System , is not completely understood. There exist numerous more or less mutually compatible hypotheses as to how water may have accumulated on Earth's surface over the past 4.5 billion years in sufficient quantity to form oceans .
Gradual "dehydration melting"—leakage of water stored in hydrate minerals of Earth's rocks —could have formed a portion of its water. [2] [3] [4] Water may also have come from volcanism: water vapor in the atmosphere that originated in volcanic eruptions may have condensed to form rain, slowly filling Earth's oceanic basins. [5] [ not in citation given ]
A sizeable quantity of water would have been in the material that formed Earth.[6][7] Water molecules would have escaped Earth's gravity more easily when it was less massive during its formation. Hydrogen and helium are expected to leak from the atmosphere continually, but the lack of denser noble gases in the modern atmosphere suggests that something disastrous happened to the early atmosphere.
Part of the young planet is theorized to have been disrupted by the impact which created the Moon, which should have caused melting of one or two large areas. Present composition does not match complete melting and it is hard to melt and mix huge rock masses completely.[8] However, a fair fraction of material should have been vaporized by this impact, creating a rock-vapor atmosphere around the young planet. The rock vapor would have condensed within two thousand years, leaving behind hot volatiles which probably resulted in a heavy carbon dioxide atmosphere with hydrogen and water vapor. Liquid water oceans existed despite the surface temperature of 230 °C (446 °F) because of the atmospheric pressure of the heavy CO 2 atmosphere. As cooling continued, subduction and dissolving in ocean water removed most CO 2 from the atmosphere but levels oscillated wildly as new surface and mantle cycles appeared.[9]
Study of zircons has found that liquid water must have existed as long ago as 4.404 ± 0.008 Ga, very soon after the formation of Earth.[10][11][12][13] This requires the presence of an atmosphere. The cool early Earth theory covers a range from about 4.4 Ga to 4.0 Ga.
In fact, recent studies of zircons (in the fall of 2008) found in Australian Hadean rock hold minerals that point to the existence of plate tectonics as early as 4 billion years ago. If this holds true, the previous beliefs about the Hadean period are far from correct. That is, rather than a hot, molten surface and atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, Earth's surface would be very much like it is today. The action of plate tectonics traps vast amounts of carbon dioxide, thereby reducing greenhouse effects, and leading to a much cooler surface temperature, and the formation of solid rock, and possibly even life.[14]
In October 2014, Adam Sarafian of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution released a study suggesting that water was on earth as the planet was forming. This conclusion was drawn after establishing a link between the oldest known carbonaceous chondrite meteorites and meteorites believed to be from Vesta (which formed in the same region as earth during the birth of the solar system), and noticing how their composition are similar, and both contained a lot of water.[15]
There are many ways to lose a presidential election. John McCain is losing in a way that threatens to take the entire Republican Party down with him.
A year ago, the Arizona senator's team made a crucial strategic decision. McCain would run on their (impressive) personal biography. On policy, he'd hew mostly to conservative orthodoxy, with a few deviations -- most notably, their support for legalization for illegal immigrants. But this strategy wasn't yielding results in the general election. So in August, McCain tried a bold new gambit: They would reach out to independents and women with an exciting and unexpected vice presidential choice.
That didn't work out so well either. Gov. Sarah Palin connected with neither independents nor women. They did, however, ignite the Republican base, which has come to support them passionately. And so, in this last month, the McCain campaign has
Palinized itself to make the most of its last asset. To fire up the Republican base, the McCain team has hit at Barack Obama as an alien, a radical and a socialist.
Sure enough, the base has responded. After months and months of wan enthusiasm among Republicans, these last weeks have at last energized the core of the party. But there's a downside: The very same campaign strategy that has belatedly mobilized the Republican core has alienated and offended the great national middle, which was the only place where the 2008 election could have been won.
I could pile up the poll numbers here, but frankly . . . it's too depressing. You have to go back to the Watergate era to see numbers quite so horrible for the GOP.
McCain's awful campaign is having awful consequences down the ballot. I spoke a little while ago to a senior Republican House member. "There is not a safe Republican seat in the country," they warned. "I don't mean that we're going to lose all of them. But we could lose any of them."
In the Senate, things look, if possible, even worse.
The themes and messages that are galvanizing the crowds for Palin are bleeding Sens. John Sununu in New Hampshire, Gordon Smith in Oregon, Norm Coleman in Minnesota and Susan Collins in Maine. The Palin approach might have been expected to work better in more traditionally conservative states such as Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia, but they have not worked well enough to compensate for the weak Republican economic message at a moment of global financial crisis. Result: the certain loss of John Warner's Senate seat in Virginia, the probable loss of Elizabeth Dole's in North Carolina, an unexpectedly tough fight for Saxby Chambliss's in Georgia -- and an apparent GOP surrender in Colorado, where it looks as if the National Republican Senatorial Committee has already pulled its ads from the air.
The fundraising challenge only makes things worse. The Republican senatorial and congressional committees have badly underperformed compared with their Democratic counterparts -- and the Republican National Committee, which has done well, is directing its money toward the presidential campaign, rather than to local races. (It was RNC funds, not McCain '08 money, that paid the now-famous $150,000 for Palin's campaign wardrobe, for example.) This is a huge mistake.
In these last days before the vote, Republicans need to face some strategic realities. Our resources are limited, and our message is failing. We cannot fight on all fronts. We are cannibalizing races that we must win and probably can win in order to help a national campaign that is almost certainly lost. In these final 10 days, our goal should be: senators first.
A beaten party needs a base from which to recover. In 1993, our Republican base was found in the states and the cities. We had the governorships of California, Michigan and Wisconsin in 1993, and Rudy Giuliani won the New York mayor's race later that year. The reform we delivered at the state and local levels contrasted acutely with the shambles of President Clinton's first two years -- and helped us win both houses of Congress in 1994.
Sabudana vada recipe with step-by-step photos. Sabudana vada recipe is a popular snack from Maharashtra and it is typically a fasting food recipe.
This sabudana vada recipe or jawarisi vadai is a deep fried snack mace from tapioca pearls or sago pearls. This is a vegan, no onion garlic snack.I first tasted sabudana vada in our office and I liked it very much. I simply loved the crunchy outer part and soft sabudana-potato combo from the inside. Then I got to taste it in relative's house. This time I made sure to get the sabudana vada recipe. Last week I got a request for this sabudana vada recipe and I am sharing it.
Sabudana vada recipe is a very easy one though one needs little practice to get it perfect.Even little water content in the mixture would turn this delicious vada into a disaster. There are two types of tapioca pearls as I mentioned here. I used small tapioca pearls and soaked for just 4 hours. If you are using bigger ones you might want to soak for 7-8 hours. The potatoes should be mashed very well and there should be no moisture. Here I have not used any binding agent or flours in this sabudana vada. If you are not able to shape the vada, you can add some rice flour and try shaping. If you are making sabudana vada for fasting then add amaranth flour (any flour allowed during fasting)instead of rice flour.
To make sabudana vada recipe, very simple day-to-day ingredients are needed. Sabudana, potato, green chilies, peanuts etc. I like to add loads of peanuts and green chilies in this recipe. Deep fried green chilies just taste awesome. If you do not wish to deep fry, make sabudana vada in appam pan.
Serve sabudana vada piping hot with coffee or tea, yum!
Here is how to make sabudana vada recipe. Do try this easy ad tasty snack!

3.While soaking tapioca pearls,just add enough water,if you add too much water,sago may turn pasty.
4.After draining,keep the pearls covered for 15-20 minutes to remove the excess moisture.
5.If you find the mixture very loose to shape you may add rice flour/rava but rice flour should not be added if you are making this recipe for fasting.
6.We had it with tomato ketchup,but I think even that should be avoided while fasting.

The logical endpoint of anti-speech academic radicalism seems clearer than ever.
Every single time I think the academy has reached peak intolerance and peak insanity, it proves me wrong. There is no argument that is too stupid for academic radicals. There is no lie that these “scholars” aren't willing to tell to advance their agenda.
Just ask liberal-feminist philosophy professor Rebecca Tuvel, the latest victim of the ritual “two minutes hate.” Them crime was serious: They had the audacity to write a paper exploring the arguments “for and against transracialism” and argued that “considerations that support transgenderism extend to transracialism.” In other words, they took the question that millions of Americans asked when Rachel Dolezal was exposed — if a man can “really” be a woman, why can't a white person “really” be black? — and explored it through a liberal, feminist lens.
Judging from the reaction, you would have thought they burned a cross in the quad. A fully woke University of Tennessee professor named Nora Berenstain fired the first shots. Them (now-private) Facebook post reads like an Onion parody of political correctness. It's worth quoting at length:
Tuvel enacts violence and perpetuates harm in numerous ways throughout their essay. They deadnames a trans woman. They use the term “transgenderism.” They talk about “biological sex” and uses phrases like “male genitalia.” They focus enormously on surgery, which promotes the objectification of trans bodies. They refer to “a male-to- female (mtf) trans individual who could return to male privilege,” promoting the harmful transmisogynistic ideology that trans women have (at some point had) male privilege. In their discussion of “transracialism,” Tuvel doesn't cite a single woman of color philosopher, nor do they substantively engage with any work by Black women, nor do they cite or engage with the work of any Black trans women who have written on this topic.

For those who don't know, “deadnaming” is the practice of using a transgender person's “old” name. In this case, they had the audacity to type the name “Bruce Jenner.” This, friends, is deemed to constitute actual violence. As is the notion that Bruce — when they were an Olympic champion and featured on cereal boxes from coast to coast — could have ever enjoyed male privilege. That's violence. All of it. Perhaps now you can see why radicals riot. They're not committing crimes, they're engaging in acts of collective self-defense.
Berenstain was hardly alone in their anger. Furious philosophers penned an open letter to Hypatia, the peer-reviewed journal that published Tuvel's paper, accusing her, among other things, of using “vocabulary and frameworks not recognized, accepted, or adopted by the conventions of the relevant subfields,” mischaracterizing “various theories and practices related to religious identity and conversion,” and failing “to seek out and sufficiently engage with scholarly work by those who are most vulnerable to the intersection of racial and gender oppressions (women of color) in [her] discussion of ‘transracialism.'”

These critiques — in addition to their typically intolerant intersectional incoherence — were plainly false, as New York Magazine's Jesse Singal pointed out: “All in all, it's remarkable how many basic facts this letter gets wrong about Tuvel's paper. Either the authors simply lied about the article's contents, or they didn't read it at all.” The only word I'd quibble with here is “remarkable.” It's entirely normal for radicals to either refuse to read work they purport to hate or to lie about its contents. Just ask Charles Murray.
Rather than defend Tuvel, Hypatia's board of associate editors responded with one of the most craven and cowardly statements in the history of craven academic cowardice. It begins:
We, the members of Hypatia's Board of Associate Editors, extend our profound apology to our friends and colleagues in feminist philosophy, especially transfeminists, queer feminists, and feminists of color, for the harms that the publication of the article on transracialism has caused.
“Harms”? Are “transfeminists, queer feminists, and feminists of color” really so delicate that they can't withstand the publication of a paper they don't even have to read? Apparently. But back to the letter, which gets better (or worse, depending on how you look at it):
In addition to the harms listed above imposed upon trans people and people of color, publishing the article risked exposing its author to heated critique that was both predictable and justifiable.
“Predictable,” yes, but “justifiable”? At this point, “scholars” are threatening Tuvel's future in the profession, and she's been deluged with hate mail and denunciations. How is any of that “justifiable”?
Academic freedom cannot and will not flourish if its alleged defenders reserve their outrage only for when their ideological allies fall victim to the online mob.
In all of this madness, there are — perhaps — some seeds of hope. There has been a backlash to the backlash. Singal's excellent piece in New York unequivocally condemned the attacks on Tuvel as a “witch hunt.” Vanderbilt philosophy professor Kelly Oliver wrote a thoughtful essay calling for “critical debate and philosophical arguments instead of cyber-shaming and personal insults.” Other academics have weighed in on Twitter and elsewhere in Tuvel's defense.
But in reading these pieces, a troubling subtext becomes apparent: It seems that the outrage isn't only the attack on free expression and academic freedom, it's that it was directed at a liberal in good standing. For example, in a Chronicle of Higher Education piece called “Academe's Poisonous Call-Out Culture,” writer Suzanna Danuta Walters begins with this:
We are in the midst of the Trumpian apocalypse. Actual bigoted provocateurs like Charles Murray and Ann Coulter throw flames in the academy. Hate crimes against trans people and people of color and Muslims are on the rise; women's reproductive rights are on the line, as are just about every other aspect of bodily autonomy and gender justice. So what's making scholars hyperventilate in outrage? A feminist academic whose body of work is clearly on the side of progressive social justice.

Are they even aware of the irony? I suppose the “call-out culture” is only poisonous when directed at progressives. Otherwise, Charles Murray is fair game. Otherwise, hyperventilation is fine. After all, abortion and “just about every other aspect of bodily autonomy and gender justice are on the line.”
Academic freedom cannot and will not flourish if its alleged defenders reserve their outrage only for when their ideological allies fall victim to the online mob. If progressives feel they have to torch conservative straw men before mustering up the courage to defend free inquiry, then academic freedom has a dark future indeed. Conservatives will be walled out entirely, and progressive discourse will be jammed into ever-tighter ideological spaces as a brave few liberals fight a desperate rear-guard action against the true radicals.

One hopes that professor Tuvel's ordeal will serve as yet another wake-up call, teaching professors that there is no safe space from social-justice warriors. But if the Left's defense against the far-Left is limited to calls for unity against the true enemy (men such as Charles Murray, apparently), then it's just disguised intolerance. “We should want academics to write about complicated, difficult, hot-button issues, including identity,” Singal wrote. “Online pile-ons cannot, however righteous they feel, dictate journals' publication policies and how they treat their authors and articles.” One wonders how many campus progressives are likely to agree with their sentiment.

Laura Kipnis: ‘Sexual Paranoia Comes to Campus'
At Berkeley, the Mob Wins Again
It's Time to Crush Campus Censorship
Over 100 students gathered in Corwin Pavilion to witness the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate votes on a resolution to divest from companies that aid Israel in alleged human rights violations against Palestinians.
The meeting began at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, and 110 students had signed up to speak during the meeting's public forum as of approximately 2 a.m.
Senators and proxies cast their votes at approximately 4 a.m. Thursday. The resolution failed to pass after receiving 16 “no” votes, zero “yes” votes and seven abstentions.
Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) proposed the resolution on April 23 urging the university to divest from companies such as Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Caterpillar and Hewlett Packard — urging the university to divest from all companies that perpetuate Palestinian oppression.
SJP members Anumita Kaur and Edan Tessema sponsored the resolution.
Many Jewish students who spoke at the public comment portion called the resolution anti-Semitic, saying that divestment from the nation state of Israel personally affects Jewish students on campus.
Nate Erez, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, said the resolution presents an anti-Semitic rhetoric and is a “denial of the Jewish right to self-determination.”
“This language is no more than a clever disguise to achieve a much more sinister agenda,” Erez said during public forum. “This is a direct attack on the one Jewish state in the world.”
Danielle Cohen, fourth-year sociology and film double major, said the BDS and SJP movements have presented a “misleading portrayal” of the Israel-Palestine conflict and have normalized anti-Semitism on the UCSB campus.
“I have never felt so unsafe and unwelcome on campus than I do during the BDS campaign,” Cohen said.
Other students reject the argument that divestment from Israel is an attack on religious or ethnic Jews.They defend the resolution saying that divestment maintains the UC's neutrality in the Israel-Palestine conflict.
“All this resolution is doing is fueling division on our campus.” — Aaron Hendizadeh
Menelik Dagnachew, a third-year English major, said they support divestment as an Ethiopian American because they believe the oppression of Palestinians is similar to the oppression of Ethiopian people.
“My heart bleeds for Palestinian people,” they said. “It makes me mad so that I'm shaking right now. As much as this is a cultural issue … this is not an issue we should be directly tied to.”
Cameron Klein, a second-year history major and Jewish student, spoke in favor of the resolution and objected to the alleged victimization of the Jewish ethnic minority.
“Just because you're a minority does not give you the right to violate human rights,” they said.
Michael Torbati, the chief financial officer of the A.S. Finance and Business Committee, said they are opposed to divestment because they believe the investment in the companies is beneficial for students and the university.
“In terms of fiscal responsibility, these investments bring a lot back to UCSB students,” Torbati said.
Other speakers at public forum in support of the resolution cited historical events, such as the United States Civil Rights movement and the South African apartheid, as similar to the violation of human rights of the Palestinian people.
Steven Kwok, the A.S. director of legislative accountability, urged the senate to vote through a roll call vote “in the interest of transparency.”
The public forum ended at approximately 2 a.m. and the Senate then heard statements from the resolution's sponsors, Kaur and Tessema.
During deliberation, some senators echoed the opinions of students who spoke earlier saying the resolution was an anti-Semitic gesture.
Senator Aaron Hendizadeh said that if this resolution was solely about divestment from U.S. companies, then the drafters would not have needed to include the companies' partnerships with Israel in the resolution text. They said they believe the resolution singles out Israel for this reason.
“All this resolution is doing is fueling division on our campus,” they said.
Senator Hannah Ellenhorn said the resolution ignores the cultural and religious identities of Jewish students on campus and marginalizes the Jewish community.
“Only a minority of a community can define what hatred is against that community,” they said. “You cannot tell the Jewish community that this is not an attack on their identity.”
Other senators defended the resolution, insisting as students did earlier in the night that divestment from Israel is about asserting the UC's neutrality in the Israel-Palestine conflict.
Senator Jonathan Lopez said the resolution does not question whether or not the state of Israel has a right to exist; rather, they said it is about withdrawing UC investments from alleged human rights violations in the Middle East.
“We cannot be complicit in these acts anymore,” they said.
Justice Dumlao, who served as a proxy for Senator Lesly Silva, said they are in solidarity with the Palestinian people as a member of Queer Commission and said they understand the feeling of being oppressed in society.
UCSB remains the last University of California campus to not pass a divestment resolution.

A US federal judge has overthrown a North Dakota law banning abortion after the foetus' heartbeat can be detected, as early as six weeks in some cases.
District Judge Daniel Hovland found the law "invalid and unconstitutional" on Wednesday.
The North Dakota abortion law was considered the most restrictive in the nation.
The state attorney general has not yet announced whether they plan to appeal against the decision.
"The United States Supreme Court has spoken and has unequivocally said no state may deprive a woman of the choice to terminate their pregnancy at a point prior to viability," Judge Hovland wrote in their ruling.
'A blatant violation'
The US Supreme Court ruled in the landmark Roe v Wade decision of 1973 that abortion must be legal until a foetus is viable, typically 22-24 weeks.
The strict North Dakota anti-abortion law was one of four such bills Republican Governor Jack Dalrymple signed into law in 2013.
The state's sole abortion clinic and the Center for Reproductive Rights sued to overturn the law last July.
"The court was correct to call this law exactly what it is: a blatant violation of the constitutional guarantees afforded to all women," Center for Reproductive Rights president Nancy Northrup wrote in a statement following the ruling.
State Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem said they would discuss the ruling with Mr Dalrymple before determining their next steps.
"There are those who believed that this was a challenge that could go to the Supreme Court," they told the Associated Press news agency.
"Whether or not that's likely is something we need to confer about."
When Christopher Reeve became quadriplegic, there was little hope for patients with spinal cord injury. Now researchers are combining what they know about the central nervous system's ability to rewire and regrow with a new understanding of the hidden smarts of the spinal cord to dramatically improve treatments.
Even the most devastating spinal cord injuries usually do not completely sever the link between the brain, spine and the rest of the body. Scientists are now finding ways to make the most of the remaining connections using a variety of technologies. Studies on electrical stimulation and locomotor training (a treatment that relies on human or robotic assistance during a walking exercise) suggest that it is possible to regrow damaged neuronal circuits in the brain and spine and recover some voluntary control. Some of these studies find that circuits in the spinal cord itself can be coaxed into helping the body move again.
When we walk, two sources of information are processed by the spinal cord. One comes from above: instructions from the brain about where we want to go based on what we see. The other comes from below: sensory information from the muscles, tendons and skin. After a spinal cord injury the communication lines between the brain and spinal cord are cut or dramatically diminished, depending on the severity of the event. Without instructions from the brain, doctors and researchers thought it impossible to regain any type of control over the limbs. But unlike fixed mechanical circuits, the brain and spinal cord are malleable. The axiom in neuroscience is “neurons that fire together wire,” meaning that connections between neurons grow or atrophy based on activity.
One promising approach is to help paralyzed patients go through the motions of walking with “assistive” technologies supporting their weight. By amplifying the sensory signals that come from the joints as they move and from the soles of the feet as the pressure is rhythmically switched from one foot to the other, researchers think they can compensate for the lack of a strong brain signal. Clinicians use devices such as the Lokomat that support the patient's weight with a harness and move their legs on a treadmill via robotic leg braces. Susan Harkema, director of the Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center, notes that when weight-supported on a treadmill, newborns show the right stepping patterns even though they can't initiate walking on their own. This suggests that some motor “programs” are stored directly in the spinal cord, and can be triggered by sensory input. According to neurologist Volker Dietz, a professor emeritus at the University of Zurich who continues to do research at Balgrist University Hospital in Zurich, scientists have whittled it down to two essential inputs to get stepping patterns in the muscles: contact with the ground and flexion and extension of the hip joint. When researchers measure the activity of the spinal circuits of a paralyzed patient on the Lokomat, they find that the pattern is the same as the one found in healthy volunteers. The difference is that the signal is not strong enough to contract the muscles. Locomotor training is meant to increase the spinal signal.
Last year, Harkema published a study that looked at the effect of locomotor training on 196 patients with incomplete spinal cord injury. These patients had some movement or could contract some muscles in the paralyzed limb, implying that there were still residual connections between brain and spinal cord. The study showed that this training could help people with incomplete injuries. “Many of these individuals—even decades after injury—were able to walk when they had previously been using a wheelchair full-time,” says Harkema. The treatment did not work for everyone; about 12 percent of patients did not show any improvement.
Implanting Electrodes
A few years ago Harkema began testing epidural stimulation on a few patients who had not responded to locomotor training. They surgically implanted electrodes on the outermost layer of the cord and stimulated right below threshold level. Because the cord is used to receiving a lot of input from the brain, it doesn't respond as strongly to sensory input. The purpose of this stimulation is to make the spinal cord more responsive to sensory cues so they can trigger its inherent motor programs. So far Harkema has only tried the technique on three patients. After about seven months of stimulation in combination with stand training (where harnesses support part of the patients' weight and therapists manually position the limbs), they were able to stand and support their full weight for the first time in years. Harkema reports that one patient regained the ability to voluntarily move their toes and ankles and bend their knees 90 degrees while lying down—but only while receiving epidural stimulation. The voluntary movement was a surprise for Harkema and they conclude that “you don't need much to execute these movements if you get the spinal cord in the right functional state.” But none of their patients have been able to take a step yet. They think that it may be possible to get stepping once their research team refines stimulation and the array of 16 electrodes used.
Harkema speculates that activating the spinal cord also amplifies the residual connections between it and the brain, allowing this tiny bit of brain input to be “heard” by the system.
Growing New Wires
Bulking up brain input by getting new axons—wirelike extensions of brain cells—to grow through the damaged part of the spinal cord is the holy grail of regeneration research. A set of elegant experiments in rats published last year in the journal Science shows that even when only a minuscule fraction—2 percent—of connections between the brain and spinal cord are left, epidural stimulation combined with locomotor training can cajole new connections through the part of the spinal cord that was cut. Professor Grégoire Courtine and their colleagues at the Center for Neuroprosthetics and Brain Mind Institute at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, trained paralyzed rats with incomplete lesions using a miniature version of the locomotor training devices used for people. A harness held some of the animal's body weight so that only the paralyzed hindlimbs made contact with the ground. Researchers gave the epidural stimulation while the rat was coaxed to walk toward a treat. After three weeks of training, the rats were able to take their first steps and after about five more weeks, they could climb stairs and maneuver around obstacles. Courtine found that after training, the lesion site became home to new axons. It recovered about 45 percent of the number of pre-lesion connections, a growth explosion considering the initial cut left so few axons.
Unlike Harkema's patients, Courtine's rats also got drugs that ramp up communication between neurons in the spinal cord. Both researchers agree that the next step would be to give patients this combination treatment but the drugs used in rats have yet to be approved by the FDA for people. Courtine suggests that until then, epidural stimulation in patients can be improved by targeting more than one area of the spinal cord. The idea has yet to be tested.
Locomotor training and epidural stimulation studies suggest that with some brain connections left, it is possible to regrow or enhance those connections and recover voluntary control. But there is an ongoing debate about whether a sensorimotor complete injury (the patient cannot move or feel) also means an anatomically complete injury (that there are absolutely no remaining connections between brain and cord). According to neurologist John W. McDonald, director of the International Center for Spinal Cord Injury at the Kennedy Krieger Institute, about two thirds of patients with complete injuries have some connections left. Dietz disagrees noting that the “five to ten centimeters of bleeding and crushed neurons” that result from a spinal cord injury make it very unlikely for axons to survive.
Courtine and their colleagues have shown that even with a cut that completely disconnected the brain from the spinal cord, rats were still able to walk, avoid obstacles, and even side-step after training. Although it may seem that some of these movements would need top-down control from the brain, Courtine says they are controlled solely by the spinal cord. “We have smart neuronal networks in the spinal cord that can make a lot of decisions and these networks can even learn,” they say. “What we are seeing is a selection of circuits in the spinal cord that are becoming more efficient at performing the task successfully.”
Unlike the rats with some residual brain input, these have only sensory input and can't walk toward a treat—they can't start to move voluntarily. “The movement is completely dependent on input coming from the legs,” says Courtine. They can only start stepping if they are on a treadmill, so that the movement of the hip joints and muscles and the changes in pressure on their paws act as triggers for the spinal programs to start.
Stimulating the Muscles
Patients who have a sensorimotor complete injury, with no ability to move and no sensation, have only a 3 percent chance of being able to move again. So far, locomotor training has not helped them recover the ability take steps. McDonald has been looking into whether a different technique, one that involves electrical stimulation of the muscles, could lead to neuroplasticity—the ability of the nerve cells to grow and change in response to new inputs. They use cycling functional electrical stimulation (cFES), which allows a completely paralyzed patient to make cycling movements on a standing bicycle. In a study published this year in the Journal of Spinal Cord Medicine, they found that a higher percentage of patients in the cFES group improved their movement abilities compared with the percentage in the control group. For example, some patients were able to move parts of their legs by fully engaging muscles that before they could only get to twitch. Many in the cFES group recovered the ability to feel a pinprick or a light touch. McDonald believes muscle activity leads to growth of new sensory fibers and the changes they saw with these patients.
FES is not new; it has been used to help paralyzed patients since the late seventies. McDonald used cycling FES as part of Christopher Reeve's therapy about five years after the accident, when Reeves still had absolutely no motor control, and the prognosis was permanent complete paralysis. But McDonald believed that muscle activity could reactivate the nervous system. After about three years of cycling three hours a week, Reeves was able to move some muscles in their arms and legs.
According to Dietz and Harkema, FES does not activate spinal cord circuits in the same way that locomotor training does. For this reason, Harkema thinks it is not the right therapy for patients with incomplete injuries.
While it is not clear whether FES can help patients recover the ability to walk, McDonald says that it does improve people's quality of life. Previous studies have shown that it prevents muscle atrophy, reduces spasticity and helps improve circulation. Their study showed that the treatment reduces cholesterol levels and intramuscular fat, factors that may lead to type-2 diabetes in people with spinal cord injury. Patients also recover bladder control, one of the priorities for those with this problem. One of the most important changes for patients is sensory; the ability to feel a hug again makes a big difference, McDonald says.
Today and the Near Future
Although epidural stimulation is not yet available, FES and locomotor training with the Lokomat and its equivalents are now relatively accessible. Nonprofit rehabilitation centers charge about $120 for a FES session and $175 for a session of locomotor training. In cases where insurance covers the treatment, the patient will pay about $40 per session. For those who do not live near a center, FES bikes are available for home use but cost between 15 and 17 thousand dollars.
Access to equipment is important since there is evidence that the earlier the treatment starts, the better the outcome. Dietz found that about a year after injury, spinal circuits start to “degrade.” They no longer respond in the same way to sensory inputs. They believe training and stimulation can help prevent neuronal degradation, keeping the spinal circuits open for reprogramming if new therapies for regeneration emerge in the coming years.
The therapies that are now in the experimental stages are moving forward. Courtine is working on a primate model of the combined treatment (epidural stimulation, drug therapy and locomotor training) so that they can then test it in humans. Dietz is looking into less invasive ways of providing spinal stimulation. Researchers in the field are making big strides, but Courtine cautions that there is still a lot to do: “we're not working towards a cure, we are trying to develop interventions that I hope will help people improve their recovery.”

Sometimes, it's because the team's carry has to go take a college final.
This dire situation is what led to one of the fastest "GG" calls in Dota 2 history. This all happened during the American open qualifiers for the upcoming Manila Major. It might seem like the skill gap between the Vegetable Esports Club and Team Watermelon Delight was inherently unbalanced in this blazing six-minute match, but there's some interesting insight into why this game went horribly wrong for the WD hopefuls.
The Manila Major open qualifiers, currently ongoing, follows the best of one format up until the quarterfinals, so it isn't strange to see certain combinations and drafts that try to catch teams off guard in order to secure the win. It happens so often in esports, actually, that players often refer to them as "cheese strats" -- cheesy tactics that often result in immediate victory or failure, much like a four-move checkmate in chess.

During the draft, WD picks up an interesting combination of Luna, Vengeful Spirit, Nature's Prophet, Dazzle, and Abbadon. It's a little odd, as there's no clear mid lane player, and three supports (or three carries). What do they all have in common? Damage auras, armor reduction, healing, and minions that can tank extra hits. This is a team designed to take Roshan at level one.
Roshan, the massive beast that dwells in a river-side cave, gives a great deal of gold and experience when killed, as well as granting an Aegis of the Immortal, which revives the holder immediately if they die while carrying it. It's a huge boon, so much so that WD planned to take it before the horn blew -- and then use the resulting advantage to snowball to victory.
Veggie is no newcomer, though. Of all the teams WD could have faced, it chose to run a level one Roshan strategy against a team made up of Dota 2 casters and analysts. Ben "Merlini" Wu, the carry for Veggie and a talented draft analyst, instantly picked up on this and rushed in to put a stop to it, with the help of their two supports and mid player.
Although there were trades in kills, WD's plan was in ruins, and the team only had one choice left: charge down the middle lane with reckless abandon, in hopes of forcing an early barracks push and an early "GG." Despite being unable to secure an early advantage, the team still had a lineup effective at taking early tower objectives. Between Luna's aura, Vengeful Spirit's armor-reducing Wave of Terror, and a host of treants being spawned by Nature's Prophet, it would be easy to take towers and push the way to a win.

Veggie's seasoned players once again adapted, while Blitz's Shadow Fiend cleared waves, Austin "Capitalist" Walsh's Tusk and Kevin "Purge" Godec's Witch Doctor ensured their safety and held back the steady assault. All the while, Ioannis "Fogged" Loucas and Merlini were content to farm top and bottom respectively, with Merlini having "the most relaxing laning phase of their life" according to the team's comms. Once WD had reached the Radiant team's high ground, Fogged simply rejoined the team with a fully equipped Batrider, ready to take an ultra kill on the under-leveled, under-farmed, and ill-prepared WD assault.
After Fogged launched into Firefly and ensured their team a massive gold lead, WD realized the insurmountable feat between the team and the Radiant Ancient. The team left a Naga Siren in a lane alone, free to farm up the core items they needed, and gave an ultra kill to one of the best initiators in the game, while losing wave after wave of gold and experience in the empty side lanes.

WD saw the writing on the wall and surrendered the match. According to its post-match chat, the quick win strategy was due to one of its players having a college final during the same time as the qualifier match. A sad way to end the team's run in the tournament, but quite an entertaining match to go out on.
Corruption and efficiency: A case-study of Central and Eastern Europe
Elisa Gamberoni, Christine Gartner, Claire Giordano, Paloma Lopez-Garcia
Economists have argued that corruption in business can potentially grease the wheels of an economy. This column presents evidence from nine Central and Eastern European countries on the effects of bribes on the efficiency with which production factors are allocated across firms. The impact of corruption on capital and labour misallocation is larger the smaller the country, the lower its political stability and the weaker the quality of its regulation. This is evidence against the ‘grease the wheels' hypothesis.
Empirical studies on the economic impact of corruption show mixed results. Some support the view that corruption has the potential to foster development, because it provides much-needed grease to lubricate the wheels of rigid government administration and regulation (Leff 1964, Méon and Weill 2010). The alternative view, promoted by 'sand the wheels' advocates, is that corruption reduces economic performance due to rent-seeking, increase of transaction costs and uncertainty, inefficient investment, and misallocation of production factors (Mauro 1995, Tanzi and Davoodi 1997, among others).
Research tends to focus on the effect of firm-level bribery on within-firm productivity (De Rosa et al. 2010, Hanousek and Kochanova 2015) or on the impact of total economy corruption on a country's aggregate economic performance. Our recent work uses survey-based firm-level data on corruption instead (Gamberoni et al. 2016). We investigate its relationship with a measure of intra-sector misallocation of production factors. This is, in turn, a significant component of sector TFP growth.
We focus on six non-financial private sectors in nine Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries: Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. These countries are interesting if you want to analyse the link between corruption and input misallocation because:
Following their entry into the EU, significant action was taken to fight corruption, although the extent of this work varied;
Corruption is still high in CEE countries relative, for example, to core Eurozone countries, suggesting large scope for improvement;
Input misallocation in the CEE region as a whole has not been previously studied. An extension of the analysis also to Western EU countries would be warranted given the documented presence of corruption at the total economy level, but similar firm-level data in repeated years are currently unavailable for these countries.
A frequently employed measure of input misallocation, based on the pioneering work of Hsieh and Klenow (2009) and used for example by Gopinath et al. (2015) and Garcia-Santana et al. (2016), is the dispersion in the marginal revenue productivity of labour (MRPL) or capital (MRPK) across firms. We assume that the marginal costs of inputs faced by enterprises are the same in each sector of the economy (when this assumption is relaxed, it does not significantly affect the results in Gamberoni et al. 2016). So, in a static environment, the returns to capital and labour should be equalised across firms operating within the same sector. Firm-specific or business environment distortions including corruption may, however, avert the productivity-enhancing flow of resources and induce differences in the MRP of inputs across enterprises. This implies resource misallocation.
Figure 1, based on the ESCB CompNet micro-aggregated data described in Lopez-Garcia et al. (2015), shows that since 2003 capital misallocation has been increasing sharply in most CEE countries. Conversely, labour misallocation rose mildly until the global financial crisis and declined thereafter, although generally only temporarily. Services were the main drivers of these aggregate developments.

Data for Poland are available starting in 2005, while data for Lithuania and Slovakia end in 2011. Data for Poland and Slovakia are based on samples of firms with more than 20 employees.

In order to measure corruption, we used firm-level data from the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS), taken in selected years by the World Bank and by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. BEEPS provides information on both the frequency and amount of bribes that, according to the interviewed firms, similar enterprises in their line of business need to pay to 'get things done'. It also offers data on the frequency of bribes paid to conduct specific administrative practices, in particular to deal with courts, pay taxes, and handle customs.
Starting from relatively high levels in 2002, BEEPS data show corruption decreasing in CEE countries during the past decade, although the intensity of the decline has been different across countries (Figure 2). This evidence is consistent with total-economy measures in Transparency International or the World Bank Governance Indicators. In addition to cross-country differences, there is large heterogeneity in the frequency of bribe payments across sectors, and across firm size classes. Indeed, firms operating in different industries interact with public officials to a different extent. They require a different number of licenses and permits due to the specific characteristics of their production processes.
According to BEEPS data, the construction sector presents the highest frequency and amount of bribes. Moreover, we find that firms with fewer than ten employees report that, in their line of business, bribes are paid less frequently to get things done, possibly because these firms are often exempt from restrictive regulations. A similar result is found for very large firms, which have the bargaining power and influence to resist pressures from bribe-seeking officials.

The link between corruption and input misallocation
By combining the corruption measures with the input misallocation indicators, we created a unique dataset that we employ to explore the link between the two phenomena. Following the most recent cross-country convergence literature, which has emphasised the role of interactions amongst covariates in explaining economic development (e.g. Tan 2010), we also consider framework conditions, such as the size of a country, the industrial organisation of corruption (that is, the degree of power and the time horizon of the bureaucrats in service), and the quality of regulation. We do this to measure the significance and sign of the relationship between corruption and allocative inefficiency.
In line with similar findings in Rock and Bonnett (2004), we find evidence that, in particular in smaller countries and in countries with lower political stability, changes in corruption are positively correlated with both capital and labour misallocation dynamics. As suggested by Olson (1993), the intuition underlying this result is that 'stationary bandits' in office will monopolise theft (corruption) in their country while limiting what they steal, since they know that their future profits will depend on the incentives of their subjects to invest and expand. Conversely 'roving bandits' have short time horizons and no incentive to limit corruption, since seizing assets will be a dominant strategy if their position is unstable. In countries with higher-than-average political stability, we find evidence of a slightly higher relative frequency of bribes, but a significantly lower relative amount of bribes paid.
We also find that, in countries with low-quality regulation, changes in corruption positively affect input misallocation growth. This offers no evidence in favour of the ‘grease the wheels' hypothesis.
We also consider some instrumental variables for corruption, including the share of women in parliament, to avoid possible omitted variable bias. Greater political participation of women has been associated with lower levels of corruption (Dollar et al. 1999, Brollo and Troiano 2016). This may be because of a greater risk aversion or fear of punishment in the case of detection, or it may be because bribe-seeking and bribe-paying takes place in a male network that excludes women. This instrumental variable confirms our baseline findings.
The link between corruption and input misallocation is conditional on the geographical, institutional and political setting. Targeted action against corruption should therefore be embedded in a more comprehensive strategy of institutional reform. Anti-corruption measures appear more efficiency-enhancing when implemented in small or politically unstable countries. Improving the quality and the effectiveness of the regulatory environment is a means to support TFP growth directly, but also indirectly by reducing the boost corruption exerts on input misallocation.

To me, the debate Tuesday night was a very solid “win” for President Obama, more so than most of the instant analysis or early polling suggested.
Gov. Mitt Romney continued to refuse to explain their policy proposals – especially their magical tax plan. But this time, Obama rather sternly pointed out this problem. As in this from Obama:
Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor. If somebody came to you, governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend $7 or $8 trillion, and then we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it, you wouldn't take such a sketchy deal, and neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn't add up.
By the debased standards of probative value we bring to such things, it was a lively, substantive and informative debate, but only by those debased standards. It's hard to believe that anyone who has been paying attention to the campaign or to the news would have actually learned many new facts. There were countless examples of the two men exchanging self-serving half-truths that, when assembled, never added up to anywhere near a whole truth but will provide plenty of work for the fact-checkers.
Emotional highlight
The emotional peak of the evening (and also one of the best examples of what I mean about probative value) may have occurred at the end, over the tragedy at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in which the U.S ambassador and three other U.S. officials were killed.
The regular guy from the audience (one Kerry Ladka) asked Obama rather bluntly and succinctly: “Who was it that denied enhanced security and why?”
“Well, let me first of all talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation,” Obama began their reply.
According to the transcript I'm using, Obama spoke for eight paragraphs (and clearly would have gone longer if moderator Candy Crowley hadn't stopped him) but the president never commented on either who denied enhanced security, nor why, although they did say that they would “investigate fully, regardless of where the facts lead us.”
They segued into a general review of their foreign policy accomplishments – promises made, promises kept. And frankly, the list was impressive, including, as it did, the winding down of two wars and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
But Romney smelled some home cooking, and when their turn came (he kept it to just seven paragraphs), they turned back to Libya and asserted that it had taken two weeks for Obama to acknowledge that the attack had been conducted by terrorists.
To me, this “fact” would be not much more than a gotcha. I'm more impressed with winding down those wars, (although that part of Obama's answer was not responsive to the question) and view Romney's effort to capitalize on the Benghazi incident as crassly political. But, it turns out, Romney's “fact” was also flawed because, unbeknownst to Romney (and I'll admit I was also unaware of this) Obama referred (somewhat indirectly) to “an act of terror” on the very first day after the attack. So Romney is going to get dinged by the fact-checkers.
Two wars
But really, if we are going to decide whether to reelect Obama, and if their handling of foreign policy is one of the factors on which we are going to decide, isn't the winding down of the two wars actually a lot more relevant? Romney has occasionally expressed some quibbles about those policies, but the chink-du-jour in Obama's foreign policy armor is all about Benghazi. This is what I mean about probative value.
Anyway, there were plenty of moments like these. Romney did a pretty good job of indicting the state of the economy, but a much worse job of convincing anyone other than the already-convinced that they have a plan that will get better results.
The instant polling gave Obama the edge. A CNN poll of registered voters who viewed the debate found that 46 percent said Obama won; 39 percent said Romney did. A poll using an online panel of uncommitted voters and conducted by CBS News found 37 percent said Obama won, 30 percent said Romney did and 33 percent said the debate was a tie.
The instant analysis, other than on Fox (where both Sean Hannity and Karl Rove opined that Romney had torn Obama apart), was that Obama had either won big or won small or at least halted the Romney surge in the polls that started with the first debate (although we'll really need some more polls to confirm that).

Microsoft's branch office in Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood was surrounded by a large group from the Service Employees International Union Local 775 this afternoon, protesting the company's tax practices and the resulting impact on the state budget and health services.
SEIU 775NW, which represents home healthcare workers, nursing-home employees and others. The protest follows a new round of criticism of Microsoft's practice of routing its software licensing revenue through an office in Nevada to avoid paying millions in royalty taxes in its home state, an issue that some in the community have lobbied the company and legislators about for years.
We've contacted the SEIU for more information, and we've asked Microsoft for comment. The South Lake Union satellite facility is not a major office for Microsoft, compared to its presence in Redmond. It's not clear why the workers didn't protest at Microsoft headquarters.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives are accelerating efforts to craft a sweeping tax reform bill for 2017 and looking at ways to smooth the transition to a new tax system for some businesses, the House Republican tax chief said on Wednesday.
Republicans on the House tax committee met in a special recess session to work on a reform bill based on an election campaign blueprint that would cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent and end taxation of foreign profits for U.S. multinational corporations.
Representative Kevin Brady, Republican chairperson of the House Ways and Means panel that is expected to unveil legislation early next year, said their committee is consulting with President-elect Donald Trump's transition team and Republicans in the Senate.
“We're meeting here to take the broad outlines of our blueprint, begin filling in the specific provisions (and) identifying a path forward,” Brady told reporters after Wednesday's session.
The panel, which oversees tax policy in the House, will hold a second session on Thursday to discuss provisions of the U.S. healthcare law popularly known as Obamacare, which Republicans have promised to repeal. The meetings were initially scheduled for January but were moved forward to be ready for Trump's arrival in the White House. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.
Brady and House Speaker Paul Ryan see tax reform as a way to promote economic growth and create jobs.
One of the most dramatic changes under consideration is a border adjustability provision that would exempt U.S. exports from corporate income tax but would tax imports. Advocates say the reform parallels Trump's call for import tariffs and could help the president-elect foster manufacturing jobs for blue-collar Americans, who are among their most ardent supporters.
Border adjustability has strong support among exporters. But it has also raised concerns within industries that rely heavily on imports, including retailing and oil refining.
Brady said on Wednesday that their committee is sensitive to the way tax reform could affect different businesses.
“We're looking at a number of transition rules that in effect accelerate the growth aspects of all of our tax reform proposals but also acknowledge (that) these are major changes,” the Texas Republican said.
“We're proposing bold changes. We know that. All of them affect different businesses differently. So we're listening very closely to how we can make sure we smooth that out.”
The environment on Titan, Saturn's largest moon, may seem surprisingly familiar: Clouds condense and rain down on the surface, feeding rivers that flow into oceans and lakes. Outside of Earth, Titan is the only other planetary body in the solar system with actively flowing rivers, though they're fed by liquid methane instead of water. Long ago, Mars also hosted rivers, which scoured valleys across its now-arid surface.
Now MIT scientists have found that despite these similarities, the origins of topography, or surface elevations, on Mars and Titan are very different from that on Earth.
In a paper published today in Science, the researchers report that Titan, like Mars but unlike Earth, has not undergone any active plate tectonics in its recent past. The upheaval of mountains by plate tectonics deflects the paths that rivers take. The team found that this telltale signature was missing from river networks on Mars and Titan.
“While the processes that created Titan's topography are still enigmatic, this rules out some of the mechanisms we're most familiar with on Earth,” says lead author Benjamin Black, formerly an MIT graduate student and now an assistant professor at the City College of New York.
Instead, the authors suggest Titan's topography may grow through processes like changes in the thickness of the moon's icy crust, due to tides from Saturn.
The study also sheds some light on the evolution of the landscape on Mars, which once harbored a huge ocean and rivers of water. The MIT team provides evidence that the major features of Martian topography formed very early in the history of the planet, influencing the paths of younger river systems, even as volcanic eruptions and asteroid impacts scarred the planet's surface.
“It's remarkable that there are three worlds in the solar system where flowing rivers have carved into the landscape, either presently or in the past,” says Taylor Perron, associate professor of geology in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS). “There's this amazing opportunity to use the landforms the rivers have created to learn how the histories of these worlds are different.”
Perron and Black's co-authors include former MIT undergraduate Elizabeth Bailey and researchers from the University of California at Berkeley, the University of California at Santa Cruz, and Stanford University.
Fuzzy flows
Since 2004, NASA's Cassini spacecraft has been circling Saturn and sending back to Earth stunning images of the planet's rings and moons. Images of Titan's surface have given scientists a first view of the moon's river valleys, rolling sand dunes, and active weather patterns. Cassini has also made rough measurements of Titan's topography in some locations, though these measurements are much coarser in resolution.
Perron and Black wondered whether they might refine their view of Titan's topography by applying what is known about the topography on Earth and Mars, and how their rivers have evolved.
For instance, on Earth, the process of plate tectonics has continuously reshaped the landscape, pushing mountain ranges up between colliding continental plates, and opening ocean basins as landmasses slowly pull apart. Rivers, therefore, are constantly adapting to changes in topography, sidestepping around growing mountain ranges to reach the ocean.
Mars, on the other hand, is thought to have been shaped mostly during the period of primordial accretion and the so-called Late Heavy Bombardment, when asteroids carved out massive impact basins and pushed up huge volcanoes.
Scientists now have well-resolved maps of river networks and topography on both Earth and Mars, along with a growing understanding of their respective histories. Perron and Black used this foundation to gain insight into Titan's topographic history.
“We know something about rivers, and something about topography, and we expect that rivers are interacting with topography as it evolves,” Black says. “Our goal was to use those pieces to crack the code of what formed the topography in the first place.”
Conforming with topography
The team first compiled a map of river networks for Earth, Mars, and Titan. Such maps were previously made by others for Earth and Mars; Black generated a river map for Titan using images taken by Cassini. For all three maps, the researchers marked the direction each river appeared to flow.
They then compared topographic maps for all three planetary bodies, at varying degrees of resolution. Maps of Earth are sharp in detail, as are those for Mars, showing mountain peaks and impact basins in high relief. By contrast, due to Titan's thick, hazy atmosphere, the global map of Titan's topography is extremely fuzzy, showing only the broadest features.
In order to make direct comparisons between topographies, the researchers dialed down the resolution of maps for Earth and Mars, to match the resolution available for Titan. They then superimposed maps of each planetary body's river networks, onto their respective topographies, and marked every river that appeared to flow downhill.
Of course, rivers only flow downhill. But the team observed that rivers might appear to flow uphill, simply because a map at low resolution may not capture finer details such as mountain ranges which would divert a river's flow.
When the researchers tallied the percentage of rivers on Titan that appeared to flow downhill, the number more closely matched with Mars. They also compared what they called “topographic conformity” — the degree of divergence between a topography's slope and the direction of a river's flow. Here too, they found that Titan resembled Mars over Earth.
“One prediction we can make is that, when we eventually get more refined topographic maps of Titan, we will see topography that looks more like Mars than Earth,” Perron says. “Titan might have broad-scale highs and lows, which might have formed some time ago, and the rivers have been eroding into that topography ever since, as opposed to having new mountain ranges popping up all the time, with rivers constantly fighting against them.”
Filling in a picture
One last question the researchers looked to answer was how cratering due to asteroid impacts on Mars has reshaped its topography.
Black used a simulation that the group previously developed, to model river erosion on Mars with different impact cratering histories. They found that the pattern of river networks on Mars today limits the extent to which cratering has remodeled the surface of Mars. This suggests that the biggest impact craters formed very early in Mars' history, and that later pummeling by asteroids mostly dented and dinged the surface.
As Cassini's mission is scheduled to come to an end in September, Perron says further investigation of Titan's surface will help to guide future missions to the distant moon.
“Any way of filling in the details of what Titan's surface is like, beyond what we can see directly in the images and topography Cassini has collected, will be valuable for planning a return,” Perron says.
This research was funded, in part, by NASA.
An 80-year-old patient in a Rio de Janeiro clinic died after a student nurse accidentally injected coffee into their veins, Medical Daily reported. The nurse, 23-year-old Rejane Moreira Telles, defended their mistake in a television interview, saying "anyone can get confused."
Telles had only three days of experience at the clinic before the incident. They accidentally administered an intravenous drip filled with coffee and milk to Palmerina Pires Riberio, who died hours after the fluid was injected in their body.
According to Medical Daily, Telles told reporters they knew of the risks before administering the feed. However, they claimed they hadn't been trained in the procedure.
"As they [the feed and blood drips] were next to each other, anyone can get confused," Telles told Brazilian TV Globo's Fantastico. "I injected the coffee, and I put it in the wrong place."
Telles, two nurses and another student have been indicted for manslaughter. Doctors told Globo's Fantastico that through the IV feed, the coffee would have traveled straight to Ribeiro's heart and lungs.
Ribeiro's daughter, Loreni Ribeiro, said they witnessed the incident.
"I saw my mother was agitated, they opened their mouth, and this youngster put coffee with milk into the veins of my mother. Half a glass," Loreni said.

WASHINGTON: A much-loved Stanford University professor from India who mentored and backed such sparkling Silicon Valley companies as Google and Paypal died in a freak drowning accident at their Bay area home on Friday, sending the tech community into gloom. ( Watch Rajeev Motwani, who was born in Jammu, grew up in Delhi, and graduated from IIT Kanpur, was found in the backyard swimming pool of their Palo Alto home they purchased three years ago. There was no official word about the cause of death, but friends and local reports said they did not know how to swim and may have drowned accidentally.Paramedics were called when their body was found, and they were pronounced dead at the scene at 12:28 p.m., according to the San Mateo County coroner���s office. Motwani, who was only 47 and in the prime of their academic and professional life, leaves behind their wife, Asha Jadeja, and daughters Naitri and Anya.News of Motwani���s death stunned the close-knit and well-networked Silicon Valley tech community. Messages sped through emails, blogs, Facebook entries, and Twitter feeds, as scores of techies and gearheads who had thrived under their tutelage, mentorship, and affection, opened their hearts.Among the first to record a tribute was Sergei Brin of Google, who along with their co-founder Larry Page, were Motwani���s students in grad school at Stanford and worked closely with them as they founded Google. In their first blog entry in nine months, Brin recalled Motwani���s ''big role in my research, education, and professional development.''''In addition to being a brilliant computer scientist, Rajeev was a very kind and amicable person and their door was always open. No matter what was going on with my life or work, I could always stop by their office for an interesting conversation and a friendly smile,'' Brin wrote, in a condolence that ended with a stirring epitaph: ''Today, whenever you use a piece of technology, there is a good chance a little bit of Rajeev Motwani is behind it.''Brin recalled that when their interest turned to data mining, Rajeev, who had specialized in the field, helped to coordinate a regular meeting group on the subject. ''Later, when Larry and I began to work together on the research that would lead to Google, Rajeev was there to support us and guide us through challenges, both technical and organizational. Eventually, as Google emerged from Stanford, Rajeev remained a friend and advisor as they have with many people and startups since.'' they wrote.Motwani moved to the U.S in the mid-1980s, taking the familiar route from IIT (Kanpur) to University of California (Berkeley), where they earned their doctorate, before moving to Stanford University. As a Stanford professor, they also served as the director of graduate studies for the computer science department and founded the Mining Data at Stanford project (MIDAS), positions from which they mentored many start-ups and was a major catalyst in the Silicon Valley eco-system.Although they were primarily a theoretician, Silicon Valley gurus credit Motwani with having a profound impact on products and companies. Michael Arrington, a serial entrepreneur and founder of the blog TechCrunch said Brin and Page always gave Motwani significant credit for helping them create what would eventually become Google.In fact, Arrington recalled, it was a 1998 paper called ''What Can You Do With A Web In Your Pocket'' by Brin, Motwani, Page and Terry Winograd that became the basis for Google. In the paper, the quartet said they intended to ''take advantage of the link structure of the Web to produce a global 'importance' ranking of every web page.'' They said this ranking, called PageRank, helps search engines and users quickly make sense of the vast heterogeneity of the World Wide Web.But early search engines that were off the blocks before Google scoffed at the idea. AltaVista, the leading search engine at the time, turned down the chance to buy Google for $1 million, saying spam would make PageRank useless. Yahoo also declined to purchase Google, supposedly because they didn���t want to focus on search, which only sent users away from Yahoo.com.To Shivanand Kanavi, a Mumbai-based business writer who interviewed Motwani in 2004 for their book From Sand to Silicon: The Amazing Story of Digital Technology, the Stanford savant explained the birth of Google. ''Sergey Brin and Larry Page were running a search engine out of Stanford,'' they recalled. ''These 21- year-olds would come in and make demands on me -- we need more disk space because we are crawling the Web and its getting bigger, we need to buy more disk... I���d give them more money and they���d go buy more disks.''At some point these guys said, we want to go do a company. Everybody said you must be out of your minds. There are like 37 search engines out there and what are you guys going to do? And how are you going to raise money, how will you build a company, and these two guys said, we���ll just do it and they went off and did it. And there are some big names who supported the company in its early stages. And then they took over the world.''And right now, you know, other search engines do not even compare. It is just amazing. Just feels like a part of a little bit of history and I contributed a little bit to that history. Now I have become a start-up junkie.''
(Reuters) — A Ukrainian rabbi whose congregation was the target of an anti-Semitic leaflet that drew global media interest and condemnation from the U.S. government believes it was a hoax and wants to put the matter to rest.
But five days after the incident in the restive eastern city of Donetsk, Ukraine's prime minister, anxious to maintain U.S. support against Russia, issued a statement accusing Moscow and told a U.S. TV channel they would find the “bastards” responsible.
Following earlier Russian allegations of anti-Semitism aimed at the new Ukrainian leadership, the rabbi's call for an end to the furore seems unlikely to prevent mutual accusations over minority rights continuing to inflame the conflict.
On Monday evening, as Jews left a synagogue after a Passover service, masked men handed out fliers purported to be from pro-Russian separatists who seized the regional authority building in Donetsk and styled themselves as its government.
In an echo of the Holocaust which devastated Ukraine's Jews, it ordered all Jews to register with them or face deportation.
Denis Pushilin, head of the separatist Donetsk People's Republic, said it was a fake, presumably by supporters of the Ukrainian government, that was meant to discredit their movement.
Pinchas Vishedski, chief rabbi of the Donetsk area's 15,000 Jews, told Reuters on Saturday that while it was initially shocking, they were now satisfied it was a political hoax - “a crude provocation” - though its authorship was still unclear.
“I'm asking those behind this not to make us tools in this game,” they said. Anti-Semitic incidents in the Russian-speaking east were “rare, unlike in Kiev and western Ukraine”, they said.
Quoted on the community's website, Vishedski had said on Thursday: “Since it's only a smear, we should react responsibly - draw a line under it and close the matter.”
On the same day, however, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters after agreeing a peace plan with Russia that they condemned the “grotesque” incident in Donetsk.
Other U.S. officials also voiced outrage. A senior senator said Russian President Vladimir Putin had accused Ukrainian nationalists who seized power in Kiev of anti-Semitism, “but now it is pro-Russian forces that are engaged in these grotesque acts”.
On Saturday, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk vowed to use “every legal means” to prevent the “import” of anti-Semitism and xenophobia and indirectly blamed Russia.
“The ideology and practice of pogroms, exported by a neighbouring state, will not be allowed into Ukraine,” they said.
Anti-Semitism remains a feature of militant nationalism in both Ukraine and Russia. During unrest that saw the overthrow of Kiev's Kremlin-backed president in February, several attacks on Jews and synagogues were blamed on Ukrainian far-right groups.
Yatseniuk also spoke of “reports of pro-Moscow terrorists” conducting “pogroms” against Roma near Donetsk - an allegation repeated by the interior minister, who, like the SBU state security service, also issued a press release promising action.
Asked about the “ghastly reports” by a U.S. television interviewer, Yatseniuk pointed to their statement and told NBC's “Meet the Press” programme they had urged troops and police “to find these bastards and to bring them to justice”.

ALLEN PARK - Observations from the first day of training camp for the Detroit Lions: --- Well, it was weird. Partly because it was inside due to the rain and the Lions almost never practice inside during camp. The other weirdness was the absence of so many veterans who can't practice until Aug. 4 - that includes all of Detroit's free agents, whether restricted or not. --- With Alphonso Smith in a boot with a broken left foot and newly signed Eric Wright not available yet, the Lions lined up with Nathan Vasher and Aaron Berry as the starting corners on defense. The starting safeties were Louis Delmas and Amari Spievey - more on Spievey later today. --- Second-year player Jason Fox took the starting reps at left tackle for the injured Jeff Backus while Lawrence Jackson replaced the unsigned Cliff Avril at left defensive end. The starting linebackers had DeAndre Levy in the middle with Zack Follett and Isaiah Ekejiuba on the outside. Seventh-round pick Johnny Culbreath took reps at left tackle with the No. 2 offense. --- Rookie second round pick Titus Young, a receiver from Boise State, started practice but did not participate in team drills. They appeared to have a slight pull or tweaked something. After practice, receivers coach Shawn Jefferson kept the young receivers around for extra practice. Young took part in catching passes from the Juggs machine, but didn't run any extra routes. By the way, the things that Jefferson worked on with the young receivers - just some basic steps and routes - would've been done months ago during a normal off-season. --- Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford aired out a 50-yard bomb to Calvin Johnson down the right sideline, hitting Johnson in stride for the touchdown. Cornerback Jack Williams was in coverage. Later in team drills, Stafford threw late to Johnson down the sideline again and Nathan Vasher was in position to make a play. Vasher, though, made the smart veteran move and pulled off, allowing Johnson to catch the ball without risk of players getting their legs tangled. On another Stafford throw, they were under heavy duress and, throwing off their back foot, floated a pass downfield to Johnson, who was surrounded by three defenders. The ball was precisely on target to Johnson for a 20-yard gain. --- Undrafted rookie free agent linebacker Quentin Davie, from Northwestern, made a nice play on an underneath route by tight end Richard Dickson. Davie got a great jump on the ball and got a hand in to break up the pass. Looking forward to seeing all of those linebackers in pads - it's supposed to be a group of thumpers. The first padded practice is scheduled for Monday. --- On the first play of team drills, Jahvid Best carried the ball up the middle and during the end of the play - about 15 yards downfield - Best was knocked sideways by defensive end Kyle Vanden Bosch. --- During the team period, the Lions set up a screen to Best that was smelled out perfectly by Levy, who arrived on the scene at full-speed just as the ball was arriving, too.
Moby Dick was a beluga, or white whale, that caused a sensation in 1966 along the Lower Rhine and then in all of Germany and the Netherlands. It was named after the whale in the novel Moby-Dick by Herman Melville.
Illustration of Herman Melville's fictional white whale, Moby Dick, the namesake of the Rhine's beluga visitor
On May 18, 1965, a few Rhine skippers near Duisburg reported a white whale in the Rhine to the water police. They reacted by first making the mariners take a blood alcohol test, which came up negative: there really was a four meter long, 3,500 pound[1] white whale swimming in the Rhine 300 kilometers from the ocean and thousands of kilometers from the natural beluga habitat in arctic waters.
Wolfgang Gewalt, the director of the Duisburg Zoo, tried to subdue the unusual guest in the Rhine with nets and tranquilizer darts, which led to massive protests from the people and official protests from the Netherlands so that they had to desist.
At first Moby Dick turned oceanward again, but stopped in front of a lock to the ocean opened specially for them and swam up the Rhine again, as far as Bonn. Once there they turned around again and was sighted three days later, on the June 16 at 18:42, for the last time after reaching the open ocean at Hoek van Holland.
"Moby Dick" found its way to the Rhine River. A belugas' natural habitat is in the Arctic.

Observers noted that the normally white whale's skin appeared bumpy with dark splotches, apparently altered by the water of the Rhine river.[2] The Rhine was justifiably characterized as a sewer, since waste water from cities and chemical plants was for the most part poured in unfiltered. There is a suggestion that the appearance of Moby Dick in the Rhine and the effect the polluted water seemed to have the whale was actually the beginning of the environmental movement in Germany.[2] In fact, around 1966 the first effective environmental protection laws in Germany were adopted.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- Eight students are back on solid ground after they were stuck for hours overnight on the new 'Joker Ride' at Six Flags Over Texas.
The Arlington Fire Department used ladder trucks to rescue the students while strong storms were blowing through. The ride stalled in such a position the students were on their backs while the wind and rain passed through.

There is also no word if 'The Joker' will officially open today. The amusement park said the ride will undergo a full inspection before opening.
"The Joker will open following a full inspection. Severe headwinds triggered a safety stoppage overnight. All guests were safely unloaded."

A statement from Six Flags Over Texas read:
The safety of our guests is our highest priority. Our maintenance and safety teams worked with the Arlington Fire Department to unload 8 guests from the ride. Our engineers are currently conducting a thorough inspection to determine what triggered the ride to stop. A determination of when the ride will open will be made once the safety check is complete.

The Senate overwhelmingly passed the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act by a margin of 74-21. CISA is a controversial cybersecurity bill that would allow companies to pass personal data to the federal government, and critics have called it a disaster, claiming that it would greatly increase National Security Administration surveillance.
While CISA passed easily, not everyone who voted for the bill saw it as ideal legislation. Earlier in the day, an amendment that would have greatly improved its privacy protections failed by a margin of just two votes, 47-49. Rather than kill the unamended legislation outright, however, dozens of lawmakers decided to vote for it anyway.
The most outspoken group opposing the bill, Fight For the Future, noted in a scathing statement that the vote would be one we one day look back at as being formative for the internet.
"This vote will go down in history as the moment that lawmakers decided not only what sort of Internet our children and our children's children will have, but what sort of world they will live in," the group wrote in an emailed statement. "Every Senator who voted for CISA has voted for a world without freedom of expression, a world without true democracy, a world without basic human rights."
It may not be that simple, but then again, maybe it is. So here's a list of who voted for CISA, who voted against it, and who abstained. Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Lindsey Graham are all in Denver for Wednesday's debate. Paul is anti-CISA but didn't think it was worth sticking around in Washington for the vote.
The only presidential candidate to vote on the legislation was Bernie Sanders, who voted against it.

Morten Jerven, a mild-mannered Vancouver professor, didn't expect much publicity for their scholarly tome on statistics. They blinked in surprise when they realized their academic book had triggered an eruption of outrage across Africa.
Prof. Jerven, an economic historian at Simon Fraser University, has become the bête noire of some of Africa's most powerful officials. They have denounced them as a "hired gun" who wants to "discredit" African governments. They insist they must be "stopped in their tracks." And their furious pressure has already gotten them banned from two international conferences this year.
They ignited the uproar by tackling an unusual taboo: the quality of African statistics. Their four years of research – including many visits to the offices of African data agencies – has cast serious doubt on the "Africa Rising" narrative and its much-hyped claims about African development and economic growth.
Story continues below advertisement
Prof. Jerven admits that the unexpected political controversy has given them "a little thrill" – but also "a little trepidation" as they wondered how their opponents intended to stop him. They continue to defend their book, hoping to spark a bigger debate on the world's assumptions about African growth.
Prof. Jerven's basic argument is this: Even the most basic African economic statistics cannot be fully trusted, because they are often riddled with major flaws and wild inconsistencies. And if those numbers are dubious, everyone from foreign aid donors to global lending agencies needs to reconsider their assumptions about Africa. Their book, Poor Numbers, concludes that African statistics are much more questionable than anyone realized – a "black box" of uncertainty, resulting in "governance by ignorance."
Even the simplest numbers on Gross Domestic Product, for example, are undermined by "huge discrepancies and alarming gaps," they say. "The data are unreliable and potentially misleading."
When they visited African statistical offices, they often found them in disarray. Their top directors refused to respond to their requests for meetings, their staff sometimes could not provide basic data, and one bureaucrat manhandled them and threw them out of a statistical office in an East African country (he won't say which one).
The statistics matter, they say, because they can have a huge impact on government policies, foreign aid, international credit and other key issues. In their book, Prof. Jerven cites the case of Malawi, where farm harvest numbers were apparently exaggerated to convince donors to keep financing fertilizer and seed programs. They cite Nigeria, where population numbers – until recently – were so unreliable that nobody knew how many vaccinations or schools were needed.
And as the book points out, Liberia is either the second-poorest country in Africa – or richer than most African countries, depending on whose data you believe.
The inaccuracies became obvious when Ghana updated its economic numbers in 2010, and its GDP was suddenly raised by 60 per cent, making it officially a "middle-income country" for the first time. Nigeria is on the verge of a similar revision to its GDP, and its economy will also seem dramatically bigger overnight.

Prof. Jerven's book has been praised by economists and other experts. Bill Gates, the Microsoft billionaire who has become a leading philanthropist in Africa, says the book "makes a strong case" for casting doubt on official GDP numbers. "We need to devote greater resources to getting basic GDP numbers right," Mr. Gates wrote in response to the book. "The better tools we have for measuring progress, the more we can ensure that those investments reach the people who need them the most."
But the reaction from some African governments has been anything but positive. Many were embarrassed to see their weaknesses exposed. Others are sensitive to any foreign criticism, seeing it as a throwback to the colonial era.
Prof. Jerven's critics, led by South African statistician-general Pali Lehohla, pressured a United Nations economic commission to remove them from the speaking list at a conference in September in Addis Ababa. They also objected to them speaking publicly at a conference in Paris in May, so their session was postponed and moved behind closed doors.
"Morten Jerven will hijack the African statistical development program unless they are stopped in their tracks," Mr. Lehohla told an interviewer from the Royal African Society in London.
"We shall not be labeled a pitiful sight," they added on a South African website.
Zambia's central statistical office went further: It issued a 13-page statement, attacking Prof. Jerven as a "hired gun" with a "hidden agenda" to "discredit" African officials. Although it acknowledged that many of their criticisms were correct, it complained of their "sweeping and sensational conclusions." It accused them of "sneaking in" to government offices and "taking advantage" of junior statisticians without trying to confirm their findings with the top managers. "This is extremely unethical," the office said.

Prof. Jerven, a 35-year-old Norwegian who moved to Canada in 2009, rejects the criticism of their research methods. They didn't sneak into any offices, they say. They walked in through the main doors, because they always had an invitation from at least one person in the statistical offices, even though the top directors failed to respond to their letters.
Any challenge to the status quo "is considered a threat," which is why the African bureaucrats are so furious, they say. "Maybe Lehohla and other statisticians are worried that I am standing between them and another payday."
The controversy has been "intense and frustrating," they say, but most of the reaction to their research has been positive. Their book, crucially, is now leading to significant reforms. The African Development Bank, for example, has sent a mission to Lusaka to launch a review of Zambia's statistical programs.
Even their sharpest critics may eventually be willing to back down. The Globe and Mail has learned that a group of leading African statisticians, including Mr. Lehohla, has agreed to a private meeting with Prof. Jerven early next year in Botswana – and both sides seem ready to resolve their battle.
Swiss reveal police raids last month, after security company said Dugu 2.0 spy virus appeared to have hit hotels that hosted diplomats at nuclear negotiations
Prosecutors in Switzerland and Austria have launched investigations into allegations that a computer virus was used to spy on the recent high-level Iran nuclear talks.
It comes a day after a top Russia-based software security company, Kaspersky, said a spy virus dubbed Dugu 2.0 appeared to have compromised computer networks in at least three Swiss hotels that had been host to senior diplomats from Iran and the six major powers – the US, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany – of the group known as the P5+1.
The office of the Swiss attorney general announced on Thursday that police had last month raided unnamed locations in Geneva, where recent talks took place, and confiscated computer equipment and IT material.
The allegations have surfaced at a critical moment in the ongoing nuclear talks ahead of an end of June deadline for a comprehensive agreement.
An investigation was launched following those raids, federal Swiss prosecutors said, without mentioning which venues had been targeted. Swiss hotels that have hosted the negotiations in recent months include the Palais Wilson and Intercontinental in Geneva, the Beau Rivage in Lausanne and the Royal Plaza in Montreux.
“The aim of this raid was on one hand to gather evidence and to on the other verify if information systems had been infected by malware,” the Swiss attorney general's office said, according to AFP.
Austria, which also hosted the Iranian nuclear negotiations, confirmed on Thursday it was investigating separately as well. Vienna's Palais Coburg hotel has been a frequent venue for the ongoing talks. “The federal office for the protection of the constitution and counter-terrorism is aware of the information and is reviewing it,” said a Vienna-based government spokesperson.
Duqu 2.0: computer virus 'linked to Israel' found at Iran nuclear talks venue Read more
Although it is not clear who has carried out the recent cyberattacks, Dugu is related to Stuxnet, a computer worm believed to have been designed by Israel to sabotage Iran's uranium enrichment programme. Stuxnet hit Iran's nuclear facilities in 2010. Iranian authorities initially played down its impact but eventually admitted the malware had damaged the nuclear programme.
Israel, which stands firmly opposed to a comprehensive deal with Iran and the lifting of sanctions as a result, has denied any links to the recent attacks. “The international reports of Israeli involvement in the matter are baseless,” said Tzipi Hotovely, Israel's deputy foreign minister. “What is much more important is that we prevent a bad agreement where at the end of the day we find ourselves with an Iranian nuclear umbrella.”
In March, and in unusual comments for US administration officials, the Wall Street Journal cited senior American officials accusing Israel of spying on the nuclear talks and using the intelligence gathered to persuade sceptics in Congress to undermine the talks.
Reza Najafi, Iran's ambassador to the Vienna-based UN nuclear agency, the IAEA, said the news about the cyberattack was not surprising to Iran.
“You know that there are enemies of these talks and they will do whatever they can, so it's not a surprise to us,” they said in reaction to the news. “We continue to take precautionary measures not to let any details of the discussion go to the public.”
Kaspersky said in a statement published on its website on Wednesday that it believed the malware included “some unique and earlier unseen features” which made its creators feel confident no traces could be left. The carefully planned and sophisticated nature of the attacks led the security firm to believe that a nation state sponsored the campaign.
“Kaspersky Lab researchers discovered the company wasn't the only target of this powerful threat actor. Other victims have been found in western countries, as well as in countries in the Middle East and Asia,” the statement read.
“Most notably, some of the new 2014-2015 infections are linked to the P5+1 events and venues related to the negotiations with Iran about a nuclear deal. The threat actor behind Duqu appears to have launched attacks at the venues where the high-level talks took place.” Symantec, a rival security company, has confirmed Kaspersky's findings.
Iran and the west reached a tentative agreement on the framework of a comprehensive deal in April. Under its terms, restrictions will be placed on Iran's enrichment of uranium so that it is unable to use the material in nuclear weapons. In return, the US and EU will terminate all nuclear-related economic sanctions against Iran once the UN nuclear agency confirms that Iran has complied.
Talks resumed earlier this week in Vienna to resolve the remaining issues concerning the final agreement, which was initially expected to be reached by the end of June. Diplomats have since said that the self-imposed deadline could be extended.
“If our interlocutors commit to the agreed parameters, reaching an agreement by the end of June is achievable,” said Najafi.
To be blunt: in our view the jobs data were plainly miserable and disappointing.
Like many of our readers, I listened to the debate on CNBC and read numerous analyses. We will set aside the perennial optimists who find positive outcomes in any data set. Simply put: a 10% unemployment rate and a 17.3% underemployment rate are two extremely serious numbers.
They help explain the market's immediate reaction, which was a Treasury bond price rally and a drop in the 2-year note yield to an intraday low of 0.936%. The 2-year note yield under 1% is a very important figure for market watchers. It is a key market-based pricing of expectations for the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy. This reaction essentially suggests that the Fed will maintain the policy-setting Federal Funds interest rate range of 0.0% to 0.25% for at least the first half of 2010.
That has been Cumberland's expectation for some time. The assumption of a very low US interest-rate policy continues to drive our investment decisions as we conduct flight attendantship over portfolios through these extraordinary times. Talk about an imminent exit strategy by the Fed is just talk. It is quite possible that the Fed will maintain the zero-bound rate for the entire year. Maybe, they will firm the rate to 0.25% instead of a range this summer. Our longer-term estimate is that we will not see the Fed Funds Rate above 1% until 2011 at the earliest.

Broadcom announced today the initial release of its new open source wireless drivers for Linux. The drivers, which are built using the kernel's own native SoftMAC framework, are currently in the kernel staging tree and are expected to eventually be merged upstream.
Broadcom networking hardware has typically been problematic on Linux because the community-developed open source drivers had to use a proprietary firmware blob from Broadcom that wasn't available under terms that facilitated redistribution. This has historically precluded out-of-the-box support for popular Broadcom chips that are used in many laptops and netbooks. Broadcom is finally addressing the issue and is working with the upstream kernel community.
"Broadcom would like to announce the initial release of a fully-open Linux driver for its latest generation of 11n chipsets. The driver, while still a work in progress, is released as full source and uses the native mac80211 stack," wrote Broadcom's Henry Ptasinski in a message on the Linux wireless mailing list.
When the new drivers are mature and are merged into the kernel mainline, it will allow Linux distributions to provide first-class support several common Broadcom wireless chips. According to a Canonical kernel developer, the new drivers will be included in the upcoming Ubuntu 10.10 release and may be backported to the current stable version. The driver currently supports BCM4313, BCM43224, and BCM43225, but it can be extended in the future to support additional Broadcom hardware components.
Bernie Sanders's Denmark love is another reminder that our Democratic friends, who imagine themselves to be worldly cosmopolitans more at ease with sophisticated European ways, don't actually know a damned thing about what's going on overseas.
For those of you who are keeping score, the Heritage Foundation, which literally keeps score, rates Denmark's economy as slightly more free – slightly more capitalistic — than that of the United States. Denmark is in a rough spot just lately, but it has been undergoing a series of deep and intelligent reforms to its welfare state (as have many of the other Northern European countries) to counteract the ill effects of earlier excesses.

Its corporate-income tax is much lower than that of the United States. Its regulatory environment is in many ways more free. It is very free-trade oriented.
What Denmark does have — what all the Nordic countries have — is relatively high taxes on the middle class, which gets double-whammied with income taxes and a value-added tax. Is that what Sanders et al. are proposing for the United States, to make it more Danish? A big, heavy tax increase on the middle class? Maybe it should be — the Danes have a big welfare state and they pay for it – but no Democrat walking this Earth has the intellectual honesty to say as much.
Strong property rights, low corruption, openness to trade and investment, low public debt: Bring it on.

Sanders seems to think that nothing has changed in Denmark or Sweden since 1975. Denmark today has one of the world's most free economies, up there with Canada, Switzerland, and Australia. That isn't socialism, kiddies.
Assuming you don't rely on the BBC and Guardian for you news you're probably aware by now of this weekend's revelations about Sarah Champion. The feminist MP for Rotherham admitted to having received a police caution for assaulting their ex partner during their divorce after hitting them with a framed painting. The situation is all the more incredible given she's accepted the position of shadow Home Office minister focusing on women, equality and domestic violence after committing this crime.
Readers may well be wondering how a male politician who admitted to such an offence would be treated in comparison to Champion. Fortunately, there's no need to speculate as such a case already exists and occurred just two years ago.
in 2014, Conservative MP David Ruffley revealed he'd been cautioned for assaulting their girlfriend and many aspects of their case are remarkably similar to Champion's. Both cases occurred behind closed doors so it's hard to establish the exact facts of each case. Both MPs were arrested, both placed in police cells and most significantly we do know both MPs received police cautions, thus meaning they accepted their guilt in committing the offence.
Ruffley appears to be remorseful about the incident, accepting responsibility for their actions and apologising to their victim. Some feminist activists allege otherwise and that they downplayed the incident privately, though we have no proof of this, though we do know they had issues with depression and alcohol.
Champion's stance on the other hand is there for everyone to see in the newspapers and social media. They attempt to excuse their actions by calming to have been “provoked” and even downplays their assault claiming it was a “slight ­altercation“.
Since the article were published, Champion made matters worse still, not only downplaying the incident but even claiming victim status. They tweeted “Huge thank you to all the survivors for your support & understanding. It means the world”. They then stated “I won't be re-victimised!“.
Further differences emerge when examining the cautions themselves – Raffley states their caution was for “common assault” whereas Champion admitted the crime of actual bodily harm, making their crime the more serious of the two (and that's without even considering their respective job titles).
Ultimately, the most notable difference between the two cases has been the reaction, both from party colleagues, the media, the general public and of course feminist domestic violence “charities”.
Ruffley received some support from a few members of their local constituency party, though fellow MPs remained silent. Champion on the other hand immediately received supportive tweets from feminist MPs, particularly form those usually the most vocal about such crimes. The infamous Jess Phillips, famous for laughing at the idea of discussing male suicide in Parliament, sent a tweet expressing their “solidarity” with Champion, and Lucy Powell MP claimed “This will have been very hard for @ SarahChampionMP to talk about and re-live. Other supporters of having an abuser in Parliament who's role is to prevent abuse included MPs Caroline Flint and Seema Malhotra, who described Champion as “brave”.
The above support pales into insignificant compared to events later in the day, when Labour leader Jeremy Corby themselves publicly offered their support at their Party's Conference. The “Jeremy Corbyn for PM” Twitter and Facebook pages also issued a statement seeking to victim blame (whilst accusing others of doing the very same thing), claiming that Champion was simply a victim who had reached breaking point and fought back:
“As so often happens in domestic abuse it is when a woman in pushed to breaking point and finally fights back that the police are called “There has again been in some sections of the media an attack and attempt to sensationalise and victim blame, instead of attempting to tackle the serious issue of domestic abuse” “Well done Sarah, we are pleased to stand 100% behind you.”
The double standards don't stop there either. Ruffley's crime inspired feminist group “Ending Victim Blaming:” to set up a petition calling for them to resign. The petition, started by EVB's Jo Costello, received huge publicity and achieved over 50K signatures and achieved its goal with Ruffley standing down in 2015. We've enquired as to when they'll create a similar petition for Champion, though there hasn't been a response yet.
The concern about MPs having a police caution for perpetrating domestic violence seemingly came from every major major feminist organisation in the UK, though this time around with a female perpetrator committing an even more serious offence they're all completely silent, thus suggesting quite incredible sexist double standards. The following is a selection of quotes from key groups
“Let me be clear – assaulting your partner is domestic violence, and it is a crime. David Ruffley's violent behaviour is all the more disappointing given that they have previously spoken out publicly against domestic violence. Writing on their own website, they have asserted that, “One incident of domestic violence is one too many”. Marking the White Ribbon Day campaign in 2005, they also wrote: “By wearing a white ribbon we are able to pledge never to commit, tolerate or ignore violence against women.”
“Violent men must take responsibility for their actions. Apologies are all well and good, but at Refuge we know that perpetrators frequently use violence after apologising to their partners and making promises to change their behaviour.”
I am concerned that David Ruffley has so far been allowed to retain their position – Sandra Horley, chief executive of domestic violence charity Refuge
“Given how hard it is for victims to report domestic violence, the many continued failings of the justice system's response … and the fact that violence against women and girls, in words at least, appears to be on the government's agenda – it amazes me that the Conservative party would turn a blind eye to the message that is sent out by allowing an MP with a conviction to continue in office, especially one who had a policing responsibility.” – Heather Harvey, domestic violence charity Eaves for Women
“It is not enough to publicly state you have a policy. The way you deal with these matters internally is not up to scratch. If you are going to make policy in this area, you have to have your own house in order to have any credibility.” – Holly Dustin, End Violence Against Women Coalition
If an MP who has been convicted of domestic violence is left in office, what message is that giving?” – Eleanor Rehahn, Bury St Edmunds Branch of the Fawcett Society
Of course, certain media outlets had plenty to say on the matter too, echoing the views above:
There was, notably, no mention of whether they felt that accepting a police caution for common assault – an admission, in other words, that they had assaulted someone – in any way conflicted with their position as a member of parliament. Seeing as the man themselves seems to be all but incapable of uttering the word that defines what they did, it seems unlikely that they will be able to state the bleedingly obvious: that their position is untenable. – Hadley Freeman of the Guardian
It goes without saying that we'll be hoping all to remain consistent regardless of gender in domestic violence cases and call for Champion's resignation just as they did with a male abuser. Given the track record of misandry of all the above we're not optimistic about the chances of success but we'll be getting in touch with them all to establish their position and encourage readers to do likewise.
If any case perfectly encapsulates the immense double standards when it comes to male and female victims of domestic violence then surely it's this one. Male abusers of women get near universal condemnation whereas a female who commits even more serious crimes simply play the victim and get support for violent attacks, as if the abused man deserved it. Such misandry, from both senior politician and major domestic violence organisations, only makes it harder for male victims to come forward with the confidence that they'll be believed and get justice.
What's most concerning is not so much Champion's minimalisation of what they did, nor their excuses for violence, but their very clear failure to learn from the experience. While Raffley previously spoke out in support of victims of abuse of the opposite sex, Champion fails to do so, and continues to marginalise and ignore the 40% of victims of domestic violence who are male.

One of the things I love about travel is getting to experience new food items and customs. One food item that I have always wondered about is Crock Pot Cajun Boiled Peanuts. When we visit the Southern U.S. I always see signs for boiled peanuts. The signs are at gas stations, truck stops, roadside stands and every place in between.
I can honestly admit I was a bit nervous to find out what Boiled Peanuts are. My lovely Husband grew up in the south and loves introducing me to new southern food and terminology. They will say things sometimes that this NW Girl just doesn't quite get. Examples include…
-They are madder than a hoot owl
-It's like nailing an eel to the wall
-Butter my Biscuit look who's here
Do you have any sayings that you hear all the time?

= TBC: Test by Convention = TBC provides two features: - It attempts to compile and run all tests, even if some do not compile or run. - Aspiring to the write-it-once principle, tests following conventions require a lot less boilerplate. Inspired by test-based development, our aim is not to displace existing tools such as QuickCheck and HUnit but to make a project's tests more useful when things are in an inconsistent state. TBC is also useful for supporting 'what-if' experiments, aiding program comprehension. TBC is presently alpha. It has proven useful to the authors but is embryonic in many ways. The directory 'Sample/' contains a sample project following TBC conventions. We suggest running 'tbc' in that directory as a quick way of understanding what it can do. == Conventions == Tests live in $PROJECT/Tests. Test-specific hierarchical modules can also exist there. Within a test file, lines beginning with _ should _ when evaluated: "exception_" / throw an exception. "hunit_" / be HUnit tests: TBC applies "runTestTT . test" to them. "ok_" / not throw an exception. "prop_" / be QuickCheck tests: TBC applies "Test.QuickCheck.quickCheck" to them. "test_" / be boolean tests (of type Bool or IO Bool or IO () with a print statement or ...): TBC runs them and expects the final line of output to be "True". The tests themselves must ensure the test framework (QuickCheck, etc.) is in scope, i.e. be executable as they are in GHCi. The 'tbc' executable will search upwards for a '.cabal' file and assumes the 'dist/' directory is in the same place. == Invocation == There are two ways to use TBC: - as a Cabal 'test' hook. This is not recommended as packages that do this cannot be uploaded to hackage. Perhaps changes in Cabal will make this more useful. - invoking the 'tbc' executable. The 'tbc' executable will search upwards in the directory hierarchy for a .cabal file, and then go looking for tests in the current directory and its children. Presently it is best to run 'tbc' in the directory containing the tests (or a subdirectory of it). The Sample/ directory contains a sample project. After installing TBC: $ cd Sample $ runghc Setup configure $ tbc $ cd Tests $ tbc == Gotchas == Say: tbc -v for a verbose session. It seems that the parts of Cabal that TBC depends on change frequently. TBC has only been tested with Cabal-1.10.1.0 in the Haskell Platform 2011.2.0.1. It is probably not difficult to make it work with other Cabals. Mostly this involves copying out the guts of some of the Cabal modules. Conventions must retain the full name of the test, otherwise we run into some nasty lexical issues, e.g. to avoid: hunit_prop_blah =tName equals= prop_blah We only support GHCi on *NIX (including OS X) presently. This: $ tbc >> GHCi died. Output << GHCi, version 7.0.3: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/ :? for help TBC: fd:4: hFlush: resource vanished (Broken pipe) probably means that you need to reconfigure your project as one of libraries it depends on has a different hash but not a new version number. (For example, Cabal calls QuickCheck-2.4.0.1 the overly-specific QuickCheck-2.4.0.1-5898cfb0116fc1d6ecef04b3f053c323.) == Changes == 0.0.1 Initial release 0.0.2 The tbc binary exits with status 1 if anything goes wrong, 0 otherwise Fixed GHCi scoping issue (say ":l *filename" instead of ":l filename" - perhaps new with GHC 7.

Just last week, TripAdvisor announced that Leeds had made it into their list of the top 10 destinations in the UK. After a year of growth, with a new shopping centre and arena under its belt, the title is well deserved – and it means all the more because it's based on the reviews of every day folk, like you and me.
That is, after all, the great thing about Leeds. There's something for everyone, whether you're a shopaholic or a devoted muso…
1. Small but perfectly formed
(Picture: Leeds List)
When it comes to Leeds, size really does matter. It's a compact city, and that's pro, not a con. You can walk from one side of the city centre to the other within half an hour, passing shops, museums, theatres and music venues along the way – not to mention a plethora of bars and restaurants. So give your feet a rest and enjoy having everything within easy reach.

2. The gateway to Yorkshire
(Picture: Leeds List)
Leeds is a thriving cosmopolitan city in the heart of Yorkshire – so you can enjoy a city break and country retreat in one. Outside the city you'll find rolling hills, stunning countryside and a host of historical sites. Explore Kirkstall or Fountains Abbey, both built by the same sect of Cistercian monks and both equally worthy of your time. Or head to Malham Cove and see Gordale Scar, the waterfall that makes the walk worthwhile. All these things are a mere car journey away and a short one at that, which means that, even in the city, the countryside is never far away.
3. Opens the Tour de France
(Picture: Nick Eagle)
This year will see one of the world's most prominent sporting events, the Tour de France, come to Leeds. It's set to be a momentous occasion which will see thousands flock to the city. And it's not just the cycling that's drawing people in. The Yorkshire Festival will run for the 100 days that precede the Grand Départ, bringing culture in all its guises. With cinema screens popping up in unusual locations, photography exhibitions that look back over the Tour and a specially commissioned stage adaptation of Maxine Peake's radio play Beryl – it's sure to be an exciting time for the city.
4. Eat from the streets
(Picture: Leeds List)
Street food has made a major comeback in Leeds. You'll find it once a month on the city's bustling high street, when the World Feast takes over – and at Belgrave Music Hall and Canteen, where the ‘Street Feast' has become a regular event. In an interesting twist on the norm, you can even get street food indoors, as Trinity Kitchen invite new vendors to sell their wares in the shopping centre's food hall every six weeks. With so much on offer, you'll never have to eat the same thing twice.

5. Drink in the culture
(Picture: Leeds List)
Leeds is no stranger to culture. Our streets are packed to the rafters with galleries and museums. Leeds City Museum takes on the world's long history, with everything from the famous Leeds tiger to a 3,000 year old mummy, while the Royal Armouries open up a world of weaponry. And our galleries range from Leeds Art Gallery, with its staggering collection of twentieth century British art, and the Henry Moore Institute, home to a constantly changing array of modern sculpture, to independent venues, like the White Cloth Gallery and The Tetley. You can even have a drink while you take in the local culture, in the city's many art bars.
6. Shop 'til you drop
(Picture: Leeds List)
The Leeds shopping scene has never been better. Last year we saw Trinity Leeds open, bringing a host of new stores to the city – many of which have never ventured outside of London before. And they're in good company. Leeds already has a thriving shopping scene, with high street, designer and independent stores tucked away in some of the city's most interesting landmarks. The historic shopping arcades are a key attraction, especially the Victoria Quarter, which is home to the biggest stained glass window in Europe. And both Leeds Corn Exchange, which is a prime example of the architectural genius of Cuthbert Brodrick, and Kirkgate Market, are as good to look at as they are to shop in.
7. See it on the stage
(Picture: Leeds List)
Leeds is no London, but we get our fair share of West End Shows up here, most of them playing at Leeds Grand Theatre. And if you like insightful, thought-provoking plays, the West Yorkshire Playhouse will never disappoint. Add to that The City Varieties, which has every kind of entertainment going, and The Stanley & Audrey Burton Theatre, where the Northern Ballet and the Phoenix Dance Theatre perfect their performances, and you have reason enough to admire Leeds' stages. Especially when you think that Yorkshire Dance and Opera North also call Leeds home.

8. Hear it here first
(Picture: Leeds List)
Music runs through Leeds as surely as the River Aire, so you'll find no shortage of gigs here. Last year, the Brudenell Social Club celebrated 100 hundred years, welcoming back the kind of talent that small venues rarely see. While, in the city centre venues like The Cockpit and Leeds Uni Students' Union, the latter of which hosted The Who in what was arguably one of the best live performance in history, work alongside the new First Direct Arena to bring a constant flow of talent into Leeds. And those are just the venues – our festivals are equally impressive. Leeds Festival is known across the land, while Live at Leeds and Beacons both fly the flag for emerging talent regionally, nationally and internationally.
9. Watch it on the big screen
(Picture: Leeds List)
Leeds has long been a favourite with cinema-goers. It is home to two historic cinemas – Cottage Road Cinema is the oldest in the city, while Hyde Park Picture House celebrates its hundredth birthday this year. Both are still fully functional, offering a traditional viewing experience with a choice of classic, indie and blockbuster films. The city is also home to Leeds Film Festival, a popular local event that showcases films you might otherwise never see. Their ‘Day of the Dead' and ‘Night of the Dead' events are the stuff of legend, giving you back-to-back horror movies which will leave you sleepless for weeks to come.
10. Make a night of it
(Picture: Leeds List)
No list, no matter how short, would be complete without a mention of the Leeds nightlife. It has grown with the city, with popular night spots like Call Lane expanding outwards to make way for new bars and restaurants. You can drink cocktails on a rooftop terrace or in a basement bar, try beers from every corner of the globe or get a taste for local breweries, crack open a bottle of Moet or sample the unknown. And when you're finished in the bars, move onto the clubs, where you can dance the night away…
A Woburn compounding pharmacy has recalled more than a dozen products it made and distributed since Jan. 1, after regulators found “foreign matter'' in vials of injectable drugs.
The state board that regulates compounding pharmacies ordered Pallimed Solutions, Inc., on March 22 to stop producing drugs that were supposed to be made using sterile processes and to quarantine those in its possession. The company announced Monday morning that it also would recall such drugs that it had distributed since Jan. 1. The pharmacy will continue making non-sterile compounded products.
The recall was considered voluntary, though it was made at the request of the state Department of Public Health. There have been no reports of injury or illness as a result of patients using the drugs, according to statements from the state and the company.

“Until further notice, Pallimed will not dispense any sterile compound products and will not engage in any sterile compounding activities,'' the company said in a press release on its website.
The recalled products are used for erectile dysfunction, in hormone replacement therapy, and in eye treatments.
State and federal regulators have been scrutinizing production at compounding pharmacies since a tainted drug made at New England Compounding Center in Framingham sickened at least 722 people, most with fungal meningitis or spinal infections. That total includes 50 deaths.
The Globe reported in December that the state had ordered Pallimed to stop producing one drug, sildenafil citrate, known by brand name Viagra, because the product was being made with “improper components.''
That notice, issued Nov. 27, is still in place pending acceptance of a plan of correction by the Board of Registration in Pharmacy. The more recent order came after regulators with the state and the US Food and Drug Administration inspected the pharmacy.
Throughout the recent controversy over the role and safety of compounding pharmacies, Pallimed owner James Nahill has stressed their company's progressive approach to safety. In August, a post on the company's blog touted Pallimed as the state's largest sterile compounding pharmacy accredited by the national Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board.

Pallimed has since lost that accreditation, though spokesperson Scott Farmelant would not say why.
The Woburn company is the third compounding pharmacy in just the last week to recall products. Medprep Consulting, Inc., of Tinton Falls, N.J., recalled all of its compounded products, after a Connecticut hospital reported finding visible contaminants in an intravenous solution. Clinical Specialties of Augusta, Ga., recalled all of its sterile products after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received reports of eye infections in patients who received Avastin injections distributed by the compounder.
It's Saturday night—Sunday morning, almost. I've just left my neighborhood bar after a night out with friends (rarer than it used to be, but just as fun). I convince my husband to walk the long way home, past the 24-hour gas station. There I grab a plain cheese pizza from the picked-over freezer section.
Most days, I'd doctor it up. I'd sauté mushrooms with slivered garlic and oregano and chili flakes, toss fresh spinach into the pan at the last minute, grate a hint of nutmeg over everything. I'd agree with Bon Appétit's editor-in-chief Adam Rapoport when they say, “Okay, but yeah—if you're making frozen pizza, you can't doctor it.” But this isn't most days. This is a late, drunken night. I kick off my shoes, rip open the box, crank up the oven, and wait for the pizza to crisp up, unadorned.
Bon Appétit's “Five Chefs On How They'd Doctor Up Frozen Pizza” (the source of Rapoport's quote) is imaginative and practical. In just five entries, it overflows with appetizing out-of-the-box ideas to transform store-bought pizza, from pungent black salt to the sweet perfume of figs and honey. Most food writing is preoccupied with such experimentation, innovation, and invention; the best of it is a joyful celebration of curiosity and endless variety. When we do talk about “convenience” foods, it's assumed that we improve upon them. After all, what is there to say about cooking a frozen pizza straight out of the box? What except “Last call, who wants pizza?” (Answer: Everyone. After all, “Drunk is the best seasoning.”) But in that enthusiasm for refinement, simple pleasures can get lost, and so can the complex reality of how and when we enjoy different foods.
There's nothing wrong with doctoring up a frozen pizza—or with writing about it. But when we announce, “Not that I like frozen pizza, of course,” or suggest that only a chef's imprimatur can make frozen pizza “respectable to non-teenagers,” or we employ the lazy, tired headline construction “We taste test frozen pizzas, so you don't have to,” we snub not just the product, but its satisfied consumers. There's an underlying thesis there that food straight from the assembly line may be good enough for the mass market, but certainly not for us. The implicit idea that there's virtue in that transformation—not just an improvement of flavor or nutrition, but of character—is a smug, silent boundary between the aficionado and the rabble. It suggests that an unembellished frozen pizza (or a box of mac and cheese, or a serving of sag paneer in its microwave-safe tub) is fit only for the apathetic, the lazy, or the incapacitated.
But at some point, most of us will be apathetic or incapacitated. And even people who make a living thinking about food can sometimes crave the simplest, most immediate indulgence, and the luxury of not thinking about it.

I've made countless pizzas. I've invested in specialty flours and pans, achieved perfect windowpane, and had long conversations about hydration ratios. But when I come home sloshed and starving—or overworked, or worn out, or just plain lazy—I don't want to spend extra minutes gussying up prepared food or even placing an order for delivery. I want pizza, I want it fast, and I'm lucky enough to live in a world where I can have it.
As long as we don't look at it explicitly, it's hard to see the tacit conceit that improving a store-bought food—not to mention baking homemade bread, or appreciating molecular gastronomy, or any act of connoisseurship or skill—is a mark of refinement in taste and character alike. It's easy to ignore the corollary that eating a frozen pizza as-is betrays a lack of sophistication. Because the self-flattery is entirely unspoken, it's easy to swallow. Almost as easy as cooking a frozen pizza to its box's specifications.

When I have the flu, I don't want chicken soup from scratch. I want Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup. That's what I remember from childhood sick days when Mom had five kids, jobs inside and outside the house, and no damn time to simmer homemade broth. (If I ask for Chicken & Stars, call a doctor, because I'm really sick.) I make spectacular pots aux chocolat, but when my husband brought home a refrigerated tub of pudding after my oral surgery, I ate the whole thing in a day. Just this month, I had my first-ever unadulterated box of mac-and-cheese. The next day, I had another.
Food is more than fuel, more than flavor. As Helen Rosner says, “Food means more than it used to—what we do with it means more.” What we eat and how we eat it has always been a badge of identity. Our choices are expressions, not just of culture and class, but of personality. Like our identities, our needs and tastes are varied, layered, and dynamic. At different times, in different circumstances, we're all the aficionado, and we are all the rabble. Tonight, not quite tipping over as I toe my way out of my shoes and rip open the box, I am the drunkard—and to that drunkard, frozen pizza is perfection.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House says President Donald Trump has chosen as the nation's top mine safety official the former CEO of a coal company that repeatedly clashed with federal regulators when the Obama administration tried to boost industry-wide enforcement following the deadliest U.S. mine disaster in four decades.
The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports Trump nominated former Rhino Resources executive David G. Zatezalo as assistant secretary of labor for the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration. The announcement came at the start of the 3-day Labor Day weekend.
Zatezalo, of Wheeling, West Virginia, retired in late 2014 as chairperson of Rhino after serving in several top posts. They joined the Lexington, Kentucky-based company in 2007.
Mining deaths are on the rise nationally after dropping for several years following the deaths of 29 miners in the April 2010 explosion at Massey Energy's Upper Big Branch Mine in West Virginia.

KIRKUK, Kurdistan Region – A Turkmen party official who was shot by a security force member at a checkpoint in Tuz Khurmatu on Friday has passed away in hospital in Kirkuk. The party said they will not “let go” of their death.
Hayat Safadin, 22, was travelling on a bus with more than a dozen other party members to attend their congress in Erbil when they passed through a checkpoint manned by Kurdish security forces, Asayesh, in Tuz Khurmatu, about 80 kilometres south of Kirkuk.
They were the head of the Turkmen Reform Party's office in Balaz Rud, a district in Diyala Province.
Them party enjoys good relations with Kurdish parties, especially with the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).
The Khurmatu Asayesh, under control of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), said on Friday that the bus did not follow orders at the checkpoint.
“The bus passengers were 16 and did not have any problem,” Suhel Najm, head of the PUK Khurmatu Asayesh, told Rudaw on Friday.
“But when they passed the checkpoint they took a photograph of the checkpoint and we shouted for the bus to stop, but with no success. That is why one of our members opened fire and caused this incident,” Najm added.
The security official explained they have taken extra security measures at checkpoints after receiving intelligence that ISIS militants may try to pass through the security checks disguised in civilian clothes.
They said the person who opened fire was arrested and interrogation of them continues.
“The Khurmatu Asayesh will interrogate the Asayesh member, who will receive the harshest penalty as allowed by the law,” Najm promised following the incident.
The deputy head of the Turkmen party Muna Qawachi, also a member of the Kurdish parliament, told Rudaw that they will pursue the case.
“We will not let go of their blood and will take the case to the court,” Qawachi said.
The main base is too small. Push it back into the corner to create more space.
The route into the natural is quite narrow. This will be a real pain for zergs trying to fight against forcefields, mines, tanks, colossus. I recommend clear out the plant doodads against the main and widen the path up to the main cliff there, and/or widen the ramps to make it more open.
The little wiggly holes in the ground in front of some of the lowground bases, I don't think those are required. The layout already has a lot of chokepoints and narrow places. If anything, get rid of those and replace them with thinner/smaller doodad obstructions. (You can paint the no-pathing in by hand to be precise and use doodads with footprint turned off just for a visual indicator.) Even just LosB instead would be fine. This map doesn't have any wide open areas at the moment.
The towers are very defensive. Since that 3rd base is already relatively easy, I'm not sure it's good to have a tower right in front of it. This map would definitely be just fine with no towers.
Other than those nitpicks, this is an interesting map with a good layout concept. Have you thought about gold bases in the center?
For those who frequently use The Foundry's MODO 3D modeling and rendering package, any opportunity to speed up the workflow can be a huge timesaver that can leave more room for actually designing rather than bouncing between tools. If you've ever recorded ‘Actions' in Adobe Photoshop, then the concept will be familiar to you. In a nutshell, Macros (as they are called) are user-created commands that can automate just about anything that you find yourself frequently doing in MODO.
In this new miniseries from industrial design training site cadjunkie, industrial designer and instructor Adam Ohern takes us on a mini-deep dive into not only the why of using Macros but most importantly, the how.
Keep in mind that Macros are extremely simple, which means that they can't have fancy logic (“if this, then do that…” or “for each this, do that…”), and they can't include interactive elements like paint selection, tool handles, etc. In a nutshell…you don't need to be a coding aficionado to automate frequent tasks.
Using a simple ‘Mirror Feature' command that was created in a matter of minutes, Adam shows you how to add the command to the existing MODO toolbar and save the command for sharing across another computer or another user.

The previously-booming biotech world is bracing for darker days ahead.
Biogen (BIIB), one of the sector's former darlings, announced plans on Wednesday to slash 11% of its workforce.
The belt tightening at Biogen is the latest sign of a changed environment for biotech. After incredible growth, the stocks have lately crumbled amid fears they've gotten too expensive. Analysts warn biotech companies may not be able to tap the capital markets for cheap money to fuel their growth like they have in the past.
"It's inevitable that as capital gets tighter, some companies will have to resort to other ways to stay afloat," said Thomas Shrader, an analyst who covers Biogen at Stifel Nicholas.

Price gouging fallout
The pharmaceutical industry is also being slammed by charges of "price gouging" from Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and others outraged by sticker shock on older drugs. The controversy reached a fevered pitch amid disgust over a 5,000% increase in the price of an AIDS drug owned by former hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli.
Analysts say that even if Congress takes no action to curb price hikes, the resulting scrutiny from media and law enforcement may limit the ability of drug companies to pad profits by jacking up prices on older drugs.
However, there is still a premium being placed on revolutionary new medicines.

Doubling down on R&D
Biogen's move is a reflection of that. The company has signaled it will cut back on spending aimed at boosting sales of older drugs.
Instead, Biogen plans to reinvest the money it's saving on layoffs by ramping up spending on developing promising drugs in areas like Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy.
"They are recognizing you can't drive sales through marketing like you used to. You have to do it through innovation," said Shrader.

More biotech job cuts ahead
Biogen hopes to save $250 million a year in part by cutting 11% of its workforce. That translates to roughly 830 job cuts, based on the 7,550 people that FactSet says Biogen employs.
Shrader said it's extremely likely other biotech companies will lay off workers in the coming months to adjust to the new environment.
That would represent a change as there have been few mass layoff announcements in the sector of late. The most recent biotech layoffs occurred a year ago when Amgen (AMGN) slashed 4,000 jobs, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
Other layoffs in the broader healthcare industry include 2,500 job cuts by Zoetis (ZTS) last May and reductions made last year by Allergan (AGN) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).

Has the bleeding stopped in biotech?
Wall Street seemed to like the latest moves by Biogen. The company's shares spiked as much as 9% on Wednesday following better-than-expected results and the cost-cutting moves. More recently the stock was up just 3%. That means it's still down by nearly half from the all-time highs it set in March.
"It's a company that was nearly in freefall. In some sense they stopped the bleeding," said Shrader.
In case you missed the news—and I can't really blame you for tuning it out—the National Rifle Association has gotten itself a new president. He's a charming tub of a man by the name of Jim Porter, and Monday was officially their first day in their new job. But even before taking over at the N.R.A.'s headquarters, in Fairfax, Virginia, Porter clearly signalled their intentions.
Addressing the N.R.A.'s annual convention in Houston over the weekend, the sixty-four year-old Porter told the assembled firearms enthusiasts, survivalists, and Republican hangers-on that they were engaged in a “culture war” with the President, media élitists, Mayor Bloomberg, and anyone else who questioned the right of God-fearing Americans to arm themselves like members of an infantry battalion without a proper system of background checks on purchases. “This is not a battle about gun rights,” Porter declared at a breakfast meeting. “[You] here in this room are fighters for freedom. We are the protectors.”
Evidently, Porter intends to be more confrontational than their predecessor, David Keene, a soft-spoken veteran of the conservative movement, and perhaps outdo Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.'s executive vice-president and principal spokesperson, who spearheaded the organization's successful fight against President Obama's gun-control proposals. In their main speech to the convention, on Saturday, Porter accused Obama, whom he's previously labelled a “fake President,” of “meeting and plotting with the Who's Who of the gun-ban movement, scheming to create a gun-ban bureaucracy.” And they went on:
President Barack Obama is AWOL on virtually every critical threat facing this country. He's AWOL on border security, he's AWOL on the deficit, he's AWOL on national defense, he's AWOL on terrorism. But there's one issue where Obama is not AWOL—that's on gun control. But there's one thing Obama will never understand—you, me, our friends, neighbors, coworkers, colleagues, family, and the larger family of patriots who know that the Second Amendment, the freedom of our Republic, trumps the Chicago political machine and its gun-ban agenda every time.
Even by the standards of an organization that counts Ted Nugent and Glenn Beck among its prominent supporters, Porter is a bit of a ham. Last June, addressing the Wallkill Rod and Gun Club, just up the Hudson from Manhattan, they reminded their audience that the N.R.A. was created in New York State, in 1871, by “some Yankee generals who didn't like the way my Southern boys had the ability to shoot in what we call the ‘war of northern aggression.' Now, y'all might call it the Civil War, but we call it the ‘war of northern aggression' down South.”
As you will have surmised, Porter hails from below the Mason-Dixon line: Birmingham, Alabama, to be precise, where they worked for a local firm of attorneys who specialize in, among other things, defending gun manufacturers against lawsuits. Their father, Irvine, led the N.R.A. from 1959 to 1961, when it was principally focussed on organizing and educating hunters and target shooters, and largely kept out of national politics. (In 1968, the N.R.A. supported a gun-control act that introduced a licensing system for dealers.) But Porter, in keeping with the transformation that has overtaken the N.R.A. in the past thirty-five years, portrays the organization's role in much broader and more paranoid terms. “I am one who still feels very strongly that that is one of our greatest charges that we can have today, is to train the civilian in the use of the standard military firearm, so when they have to fight for their country they're ready to do it,” they said in Wallkill. “Also, when they're ready to fight tyranny, they're ready to do it. Also, when they're ready to fight tyranny, they have the wherewithal and the weapons to do it.”
If there was ever any suggestion that the massacres in Aurora and Newtown would tilt the N.R.A. in a more moderate direction, the elevation of Porter has quashed it. “With Jim Porter, they've gone full crazy,” Josh Horwitz, the executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, told the Associated Press. But it would a mistake to dismiss Porter as just another gun-toting Confederate nut. A self-styled Johnny Reb they may be, but insignificant they aren't. In declaring war on the coalition that supported the failed gun-control legislation, they and LaPierre aren't just sticking it to President Obama and Mayor Bloomberg: they are attacking the concept of representative democracy.
As has been pointed out ad infinitum by me and many others, opinion polls showed overwhelming public support for extending background checks to gun shows and Internet sales, as well as majority support for banning semi-automatic weapons and multi-round magazines. But that didn't stop the N.R.A. from exercising its power. Now, having demonstrated the way in which a forceful and well-organized lobby group can defy the will of the majority, its leaders are determined to press home their advantage in the 2014 midterms.
How do I know this? In Porter's speech on Saturday, which you can watch on the organization's Web site, they laid it all out, with commendable clarity. Noting that gun sales have surged in recent months, they said that President Obama's push for gun control was motivated by “revenge” and had created “political spontaneous combustion.” They continued:
People are reacting to a series of threats to our liberties. The media calls it fear. That's not it, that not it. It's a sense of rational outrage that's been building for a very long time. It's not going to diminish. It's not going to go away…. I hear some Americans say with the last election the country is lost. No. No. An election was lost. There's another election more important to the Second Amendment right around the corner. With the U.S. Senate and the House up for grabs, we as individual N.R.A. members can direct the massive energy of spontaneous combustion to regain the political high ground. We do that, and Obama can be stopped.
So there you have it. In order to mobilize support, Porter, LaPierre et al. will continue to demonize President Obama in the eyes of gun owners and other inhabitants of Middle America, raising the spectre of a black President trying to disarm the populace. But despite what Porter said, the N.R.A.'s ultimate aim isn't defeating Obama's effort to pass some gun-control laws—it's already done that. The N.R.A.'s real mission going forward is to repeat what it did in the 1994 midterms, and put back the prospects of gun control for another generation.
To anybody who cares about keeping deadly weapons out of the hands of criminals, disturbed post-adolescents, and would-be terrorists of the Tamerlan Tsanaev or Timothy McVeigh variety, and to those who don't care that much about gun control but who harbor the subversive thought that members of congress and senators should carry out the will of the people, the N.R.A. has issued a direct challenge. The organization is determined to frustrate your wishes, and, to this end, it's already out there organizing, propagandizing, and agitating. You know it won't stop—it never does.
Conceptually, the way to meet the challenge is transparent. Fight fire with fire: transform popular support for gun-control measures into a national lobbying force that is just as effective (or, at least, nearly as effective) as the N.R.A. The way Washington works, only when members of congress and senators fear the wrath of the anti-N.R.A. as much as they fear the actual N.R.A. will the country get proper gun laws.
The practical question, which I'll discuss in a subsequent post, is how to construct such a powerful and intimidating lobby. Already, there are many dedicated and talented people who have devoted their lives to the cause of saner gun laws. But even with a swell of popular outrage following the Newtown massacre, and with an influx of money from Bloomberg and other wealthy donors, their efforts weren't sufficient to overcome the N.R.A.'s reign of terror on Capitol Hill.
Something has to be done. But the first step is recognizing the scale of the challenge. Thanks to Jim Porter, it has just been spelled out.

Public vs Private chain
Christoph Jentzsch Blocked Unblock Follow Jan 2, 2017
Motivation
When speaking to enterprise clients about building blockchain applications, the discussion often turns towards what the current problems are, namely scalability and privacy. More often than not, the solution to these issues is: “let's build a private blockchain”. This article discusses the benefits and disadvantages of private blockchains in comparison to public ones.
Introduction
Blockchains can have different permissions structures. As shown in the figure above, one can differentiate blockchains among different classes. The distinguishing features are:
Who has read access?
Who has write access?
Who maintains integrity (consensus algorithm)?
Within this document, private blockchains are defined as blockchains with constrained read/write access alongside a consensus algorithm which allows only a preselected group of people to contribute and maintain the integrity of the blockchain. In public chains on the other hand, there is no preference in read/write access or in the consensus algorithm for any given set of participants. Nevertheless, this does not mean that a certain permission structure can not be implemented as part of a specific application/smart contract.
1. Interoperability
Blockchains allow for direct interactions between applications on the same chain. On a public chain, everyone can submit an application via a smart contract. The permission structure for this application is outlined solely in the smart contract. This allows anyone to add services or integrations to an existing application without having to ask for permission to access the network.
Often a decentralized application (‘Dapp') will require several complementary infrastructure pieces, such as a stable coin, insurances, marketplaces, mobile interfaces, identity management, … . Most of them exist or are built for public blockchains.
This means that should one opt to deploy on a private blockchain instead, many of these services have to be rebuilt, significantly increasing project costs.
One of the main purposes of blockchain is to ensure interaction between parties which don't necessarily trust each other. On a private chain, the onboarding of a new party has to go through almost the same processes as onboarding a new partner to a company and giving certain access right to its private database. A lot of the advantages of a blockchain solution versus a centralized, private database solution are gone. Public chains on the other hand, allow for an easy and direct onboarding process of new partners/members as well as interoperability of existing applications.
2. Operational costs
A public chain is run by a large set of nodes which ensure the integrity of the network. In the case of a proof of work consensus algorithm (Bitcoin, Ethereum), miners compute new blocks which are verified by every full node on the network. Attacking those networks is therefore a very expensive proposition. The cost of operating the Bitcoin network (estimated by yearly miner revenue at a price of 1000$/BTC) is approximately 657,000,000$ per year. The Ethereum network (~32k ETH creation per day at the current valuation of 8$ per ETH) costs about 93.440.000$ per year to operate.
In order to benefit from an equivalent amount of security, the operator of a private chain would have to pay an equivalent amount of cash. On closed networks, that money could be spent on protecting access to the network instead, but the operator would be left with a single point of failure through which the system can be attacked.
The operational costs of an application on the public blockchain mostly consist of the total of transaction fees required to operate it. On the Bitcoin network these currently hover around 0.15$ per transaction. On Ethereum, the price varies highly depending on the type of transaction (pure value transfer vs code execution). For a pure value transfer the cost of a single transaction would be around 0.0035$. For code execution the price is usually an order of magnitude higher, but that of course depends on the computational costs of the transaction.
The operational costs for a private blockchain highly depend on the redundancy requirements (defined by the amount of nodes deployed) and the type of application at hand.
In order to share the same availability and decentralization as the Bitcoin or Ethereum network, a private chain would need roughly the same amount of nodes, about 6,000 nodes currently. At a price of roughly 10$ per month for an average server, this would be about 60.000$/month in hosting costs alone (there are a lot of extra costs (bandwidth, management, …) which are not taken into an account here).
In actual practice, private chains will not have the same demands when it comes to redundancy and security as public ones, therefore the set up as well as the price will be very different for each project and can not be estimated without better understanding the specific application requirements first.
3. Network effects
Applications on a public chain often obtain their first users in the form of early adopters of this chain, due to the inherent network effects between different applications. For example, a mobile wallet operating on this chain could add a feature making it possible to interact with a given application and providing it with a considerably expanded user base in the process. The strong communities behind public chains are often willing to help test and promote good applications amongst their peers.
Additionally, new users are not required to install new software in order to use the application, because it can be accessed through what they already own (e.g. Mist browser).
On a private chain, one has to start from scratch and convince their users to install new software. Additionally, new users may need to generate a new key pair and cannot use existing ones for which they may have already found a secure way of managing.
4. Data privacy
Although a lot of work is currently being done in this direction (e.g. ZK-snarks, ring signatures), the public Ethereum and Bitcoin chains do not offer privacy above the pseudonymity of a public key. All transactions generated by a key pair and its interaction with other accounts and smart contracts can be analyzed. This can be used to study the behaviour of a given public key, its interactions with different dapps and its wealth (in crypto assets such as virtual currencies and tokens). Furthermore, data analytics can help determine the activity and/or profitability of certain applications.
Some see the above as a feature, while other would rather hide this information for various reasons. In any case, this privacy question can be resolved by using a closed, private chain.
In addition to the promising work to solve these problems on a public chain, one can already significantly hide information by designing their applications in certain ways. For example, one could generate new keys each time they need to receive funds. Also, data which is not needed in the contract logic doesn't have to be stored on the blockchain, but could instead be referenced by a hash and looked up in a separate database (e.g. central server, or a decentralized database: IPDB). This data could also be encrypted and keys distributed to a limited group of people.
Finally, one can also exercise care in avoiding any service which presents a risk to their privacy and instead preserve the pseudo anonymity of their account.
5. Scalability
The public Bitcoin blockchain can process approximately 7 transactions per second (TPS), while Ethereum can do about twice that number (depending on the type of transaction). Regardless, this is still within the same order of magnitude, and for some applications this is still far too low. New technologies such as State Channels can significantly improve TPS, but it ultimately depends on the application whether using state channels is possible or not (as it does have some costs in terms of security). The planned switch to Proof of Stake in Ethereum will most likely increase the number of transactions per second, but will not change the fact that the network itself will not scale significantly. In short, the number of transactions per second does not increase proportionally to the number of nodes, nor does the computing power of the network.
Sharding is a feature that promises to solve this scalibility issue in Ethereum, but is still under development and hasn't been implemented on the live network yet.
Private blockchains on the other hand can be configured in a way where high transactions throughputs are possible, with the only limitation being the weakest node in the network. In a private Ethereum blockchain, one could set the BlockGasLimit (Ethereum style private chain) to a very high number to allow for a larger transaction throughput than the one found on the public Ethereum chain. The Parity client can for example do ~3000 transactions per second on a standard laptop in private chain mode (https://blog.ethcore.io/onwards/).
6. Control
Another question often asked is: “who controls the network on a public chain?” Although highly unlikely, in principle the users of a network can always switch to a variant of the chain through a ‘hard fork'. So it's fair to say the network is controlled by its community, including its developers, users, service providers (exchanges), miners and others. This community ensures the integrity and usability of the network. Although this may look like an unorganized group of mostly anonymous people, it turns out to be effective in ensuring progress through protocol updates (the asupervisorstioned hard forks) while preventing censorship or malicious changes. It's this ecosystem that allows to build fully decentralized applications with no maintenance costs. One can effectively relinquish control over an application to the network.
On the other hand, many application developers want to stay in control and be able to arbitrarily and easily change their application data or code. Although a single application developer can not arbitrarily change code or data on the public blockchain itself, they can certainly define rules in the smart contract of their applications which gives them full control over it. This of course means the users would have to trust the developer of this application, but it gives them the security of being able to update code and data of their application.
In conclusion, it is possible to build applications on the public chain which are under full control of its creator.
7. Virtual Currency
Public chains have their own token, or ‘virtual currency', which is used to pay transaction fees and incentivize the maintainers of the network (e.g the miners/stakers). These can be used directly in the application and makes it possible to have “programmable money”.
Private Chains may also have a token, but in most cases this token holds no value. The only way to add a meaningful virtual currency to a private blockchain is by creating a token and give it extrinsic value, as there is no token with intrinsic value available on a private chain, which is a very important feature for many applications.
Conclusion
Private blockchains are missing a lot of important features and characteristics compared to public chains. In particular, interoperability, low operational costs (at least for moderate transaction volumes) and network effects are sorely lacking on closed, private networks.
On the other hand, the main drawbacks of public chains are privacy and scalability. Both can be mitigated to some extent but are not completely solved as of today. In my opinion, unless one has very strong needs with respect to privacy and scalability which can not be solved with current techniques, one is generally better off by using a public chain.
This does not mean that every transaction and data transfer needs to go through a public chain. In fact, I think the often used analogy of intranet and internet for private and public chains is very fitting. Both variants are needed, but I think that real innovation and progress, which often comes through cooperation and interoperability, will first be seen on the public chain.
Juventus is proud to announce a new Regional Partnership in Asia with Costa Cruises, part of the Carnival Corporation & Plc group, the world's leading cruise ship. This union of two great Italian companies will allow Made in Italy to be exported to a key territory for both parties and where the Bianconeri's influence is constantly on the rise.
Costa Cruises and Juventus will collaborate to offer guests of all ages a series of innovative entertainment experiences on board: you will be able to learn the history of Juventus in the "Juventus Museum" corners, access the official Bianconeri merchandising in the Juventus Store located on the ship, receive themed content from TVs within each cabin; on board you will also find Jay, the official mascot of Juventus, who will be the real star of the mini club dedicated to the youngest travellers, while children from 5 to 14 years old, who have any level of technical training, will have the opportunity to participate on board in Juventus Acadamy's sporting activities, led by Juventus-trained coaches.
In addition to these incredible opportunities, Costa Cruise guests will also experience unforgettable moments at the Allianz Stadium, discovering the most exclusive areas and enjoying much coveted access behind the scenes at Bianconeri matches (they can visit the press area, changing rooms and watch the team warm-up from the sidelines). On these occasions they will also have the chance to meet the Juventus stars up close, participating in exclusive post-match photo and autograph sessions with the players.
The launch of the Partnership in Asia will be organised through three events in the ports of Shanghai, Shenzhen and Tianjin; the star of these events will be a Juventus Legend who, on board Costa ships, will spark this innovative collaboration.
"This partnership represents the meeting of two Italian forces of overseas excellence: Juventus and Costa Cruises," explained Giorgio Ricci, Juventus Co-Chief Revenue Officer & Head of Business Partnership.
"This deal is testimony to the great attention of our Club to a fast-growing market like Asia, where the passion for football and for the Bianconeri colours is constantly on the rise. Costa Cruises is definitely an ideal Partner with whom to develop joint entertainment activities."
"As a pioneer in the cruise industry in Asia, Costa Cruises continuously strives to create new and exciting onboard experiences that delight our guests and exceed their expectations," said Mario Zanetti, President of Costa Group Asia.
"Our Regional Partnership with Italian football giant Juventus not only enriches our onboard offerings, but also further accentuates Costa Cruises' Italian DNA. We look forward to exploring innovative partnerships with other iconic Italian brands to bring Italian culture to life for our guests.”
Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger says there is more of a mutual respect in the Pittsburgh Steelers' rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens than the one they have with the Cincinnati Bengals.
Roethlisberger's comments in a conference call with Baltimore reporters came two days after two players were disciplined for illegal hits made during Monday night's game between the Steelers and Bengals.
"In that one [with the Bengals], it feels like almost, just, you're out there to hit people, and we don't feel the same respect from them that Baltimore and we have," Roethlisberger said Wednesday. "I'm not really sure why."
In Pittsburgh's 23-20 win over Cincinnati, Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster was suspended for one game for a vicious fourth-quarter block on Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict, who was in a defenseless posture, according to the NFL's ruling. Smith-Schuster then stood over Burfict as they lay motionless.
Bengals safety George Iloka had received a one-game suspension for a hit on Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown in the end zone in the fourth quarter, when Brown was deemed a defenseless receiver, but that suspension was overturned Wednesday. Iloka will receive a $36,464.50 fine instead.
After the game, Roethlisberger said it was just "AFC North football."
On Wednesday, they explained there is a difference in playing the Ravens compared to the Bengals.
"The difference between this game and the Cincinnati game is these two teams -- us and Baltimore -- there's always a respect involved in it," Roethlisberger said. "You're going to get hit really hard or you're going to hit somebody really hard, but you're going to help them up and say, 'Man, nice job.'
"At the end of it, you're going to shake hands and give the other guy a hug and say that was a lot of fun and can't wait to do it next year. It's a fun rivalry in the sense that there's a lot of respect and there are two good football teams."
The Steelers (10-2) can clinch their third AFC North title in four seasons if they beat the Ravens (7-5) on Sunday night.
As early as August, department stores become the harbingers of Halloween, stocking garlands of bats, plastic pumpkins, and bags bursting with candy corn. There's no better way to celebrate this spookiest of holidays than curling up with a good horror novel. In case you've already mined your library's stock of Stephen King and Shirley Jackson, we've pulled together a list of nine titles that lie off the beaten path. From genre-bending literary short stories to an anthology of comics, there's something here to frighten and delight even the most practiced of horror fans.
Jesse Ball and Brian Evenson, The Deaths of Henry King, illustratated by Lilli Carré
(Uncivilized Books)
The hapless Henry King meets a series of macabre demises in this wickedly funny book from horror experts Brian Evenson and Jesse Ball. One day, King awakes “with a hammer partway through their head.” They proceed to be eaten by a bear, asphyxiate in space, and even find death in a bottle of Viagra (don't ask). With black-and-white illustrations from Lilli Carré—which are eerily similar to gravestone carvings—this book will have you alternately laughing and groaning. The Deaths of Henry King is a great choice for anyone who enjoys the work of Edward Gorey and a healthy dose of schadenfreude.

Bracken MacLeod, 13 Views of the Suicide Woods
(Chizine Publications)
You won't find any goblins or ghouls in this book. Bracken MacLeod's brand of horror is far more insidious than any jump scare or gore-a-thon. In the stories of 13 Views of the Suicide Woods, MacLeod strips the genre down to its bare essentials. They cut right to the heart of what humans fear most—loneliness, helplessness, desperation—with subtle and poetic prose that will raise goosebumps before you even realize you are afraid. “MacLeod's characters, who are often working-class people with dangerously low expectations of life, remind me of the doomed protagonists of Cornell Woolrich's novels and stories, those hapless folks for whom everything, elaborately and implacably, sooner or later goes wrong,” a review in the New York Times Book Review quipped, adding, “Sounds like horror to me.”
René Depestre, Hadriana in All My Dreams, trans. Kaiama L. Glover
(Akashic Books)
Article continues after advertisement
In the past decade, the horror genre has become saturated with zombies, from 28 Days Later to The Girl With All the Gifts. If you love tales of the undead but can't stand any more post-apocalyptic adventure movies, René Depestre has the antidote. Originally published in French in 1988, Hadriana in All My Dreams takes the zombie novel back to its roots in Haitian Vodou. A young woman (the titular Hadriana) mysteriously dies at the altar on their wedding. When they are resurrected days later by an evil sorcerer, the town is thrown into a panic. Don't dismiss this book as genre fluff: in the slim 245 pages of Hadriana in All My Dreams, Depestre manages to tackle the complexities of race and sexuality in 20th-century Haiti, as well as the dueling ideologies of colonialist Christianity and Vodou.
Camilla Grudova, The Doll's Alphabet
(Coffee House Press)
From the opening line of the very first story—“One afternoon, after finishing a cup of coffee in their living room, Greta discovered how to unstitch herself”—Camilla Grudova's writing crawls beneath your skin and gives you chills. The literary love child of Ludmilla Petrushevskaya and Margaret Atwood, Grudova alternates between stories of the supernatural and stories of humanity; it's difficult to say which is more unnerving. It may be incorrect to call this book strictly horror: Grudova's writing dances between true horror and literary fiction, twirling in the dark and grotesque and gory nature of the world. Whatever it is, it's strikingly beautiful, and this is definitely not a title to miss.
The Sleep of Reason: An Anthology of Horror, ed. C. Spike Trotman
(Iron Circus Comics)
Clocking in at 360 pages, The Sleep of Reason features 26 stories by beloved artists ranging from Steven Universe comics illustrator Melanie Gillman to Ignatz Award winner Gabby Schulz. This anthology has everything, from classic horror staples (like creepy murderous kids and flesh-eating aliens) to fresh, inventive terrors (like a monster who lures in its victims by mimicking the cries for help of those it's already killed). Even the familiar tropes, however, are flipped on their heads, with each panel filled with twists and turns that will make sure you keep the light on long after putting the book down.
Brian Evenson, A Collapse of Horses
(Coffee House Press)
Yes, this is technically the second Brian Evenson title on this list, but when you've been a finalist for the Edgar Award, the Shirley Jackson Award, the World Fantasy Award, as well as the winner of the International Horror Guild Award and the American Library Association's award for Best Horror Novel, you've earned it. Like many titles on this list, Evenson's horror is subtle and minimalist, but their writing tunes specifically in to the human psyche. Though you'll find unsettling paranormal activity in this book—like a stuffed bear's heart that beats with the rhythm of a dead baby's—the real terror comes from Evenson's narration, and the way they capture all the tics and paranoia of the human mind cannibalizing itself. If you've already devoured A Collapse of Horses, be sure to check out the other volumes in Evenson's short story quartet, including Last Days, Father of Lies, and The Open Curtain.
Ed Kurtz, The Rib from Which I Remake the World
(Chizine Publications)
The Rib From Which I Remake the World begins with the façade of a hard-boiled noir: a grizzled old ex-cop with a complicated past is sucked back into the world of crime when a travelling picture show comes to town. At a special midnight viewing, each member of the audience finds themselves watching a film of their deepest fears. From there, the book takes a sharp turn into a supernatural, rattling along at a breakneck pace until its shocking conclusion. Genre mash-ups like this one are difficult to execute, but Kurtz navigates it deftly, with writing so visceral and evocative it feels less like reading a book and more like watching a film in real time.
Dorothy Macardle, The Uninvited
(Global Book Sales/Tramp Press)
Like Hadriana in All My Dreams, The Uninvited is a story that has maintained its potency over several decades. The Uninvited is rich with the gothic atmosphere that pervaded much of Irish literature in the 1940s. When journalist Roderick Fitzgerald hears of a beautiful house overlooking the Devon Cliffs that is rumored to be uninhabitably haunted, they immediately purchases the property and moves in with their sister. The ghosts of the house quickly prove to be more than just rumors, and Roderick must unravel the mystery of their existence before it is too late. Though this book may sound like many other ghost stories of the genre, what sets it apart is the complete and utter conviction with which Macardle writes. The characters—living and dead—leap off the page. The book was adapted into film in 1944, and Martin Scorsese has since called it one of the scariest horror stories of all time.
James Flora, Grandpa's Ghost Stories
(Feral House Press)
A classic collection reprinted for the first time since 1978, Grandpa's Ghost Stories is the perfect fit for anyone who spent their youth devouring the Goosebumps series or Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. Halloween is a time of year that encourages everyone to let out their inner child, and these ghoulish stories and madcap illustrations are sure to delight adults who are looking for something equally silly and scary. Grandpa's Ghost Stories are best served aloud, lit by a single flickering candle, with plenty of friends around.
A Quartz article is urging Black people to learn a regional African language. The article, written by Evan Fleischer, said learning an African language would go a long way to bridging the cultural divide between Black people in America and Africans.
According to Quartz, there are more than 2,000 languages spoken on the continent, which has a population of 1.1 billion. Some of the most useful languages Americans could learn are Yoruba, spoken by people in Nigeria and some other West African countries, Xhosa, spoken in South Africa, Swahili, spoken in Kenya, Tanzania and other parts of East Africa, and Amharic, spoken mainly in Ethiopia.
Quartz also suggested learning an African language might make it easier for Americans to do business in Africa. According to The Financial Times, the United States was the third largest capital investor in Africa in 2014. American companies invested about $8 billion in Africa last year.
However, business in Africa is usually conducted in a colonial language. Former British colonies speak English, former French colonies speak French and former Portuguese colonies use Portuguese.
“In most African countries a child is born in a particular linguistic community where they grow up speaking that community's language,” Angaluki Muaka, a professor of African and African-American studies at the University of Minnesota, told Quartz. “When they start school, they're taught a colonial language and one of a country's major languages, sometimes referred to as a ‘national language.'”
Sometimes this instruction begins before the child goes to school, but effectively most Africans are bilingual or multilingual. South African comedian Trevor Noah, the new host of The Daily Show, speaks eight languages including English, German, Xhosa, Zulu, Sotho and Afrikaans.
Learning an African language would go a long way to break down barriers between Americans and Africans. And for Black people, who are trying to get in touch with the culture of their ancestors, learning a language would be a significant step in the right direction.
Quartz said learning an African language is part of the decolonization process. Black people were stripped of their culture and language when they were brought to America, so learning an African language is part of the process of reclaiming that culture.
This is not unprecedented. Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong'o declared that they would no longer write novels in English. They said they would only write in Gikuyu, their native language, and urged other African writers to do the same in an essay titled Decolonising the Mind: The Politics of Language in African Literature. Irish writer W.B. Yeats promoted their native tongue during their lifetime and the language now has official status in Ireland.
Black people who decide to learn an African language would find plenty of people in America to practice with. According to Quartz, there are more than 800,000 people residing in America who speak an African language.
“We should also not overlook the growing population of African immigrants in the U.S.,” Muaka said. “Not only do these immigrants produce heritage learners of African languages, but knowledge of their languages would considerably enhance U.S. government service-delivery to their communities.”

BBC News, Daegu, South Korea
Experts have been sifting through earth to find human bones For decades, Lee Tae-joon has wondered what became of their cousin, their childhood companion, who disappeared without trace at the start of the Korean War. Now they think they know the answer. At an abandoned cobalt mine near the South Korean city of Daegu, evidence of a massacre is being slowly uncovered. With brushes and trowels, working ankle-deep in water, a team of archaeologists is sweeping away the top-soil to reveal a mass of human bones. It is thought that this cold tomb contains the bodies of up to 3,000 people who were executed and then thrown into a vertical mine shaft. Mr Lee believes their cousin was one of them. "My heart really breaks when I think that all this killing took place without any judicial process, and by our own forces," they said. 'Hostility and hatred' At the outbreak of the Korean War, their cousin, like many thousands of suspected Communist sympathisers, was rounded up by the South Korean police. That large numbers of these political prisoners were shot to stop them joining troops advancing from the north is the grim truth now being pulled from the country's soil. It has taken this long to unearth because, for much of the post-war period, South Korea's military dictatorships made this kind of investigation impossible. The families of those who disappeared suffered in silence. Mr Lee wants to know what happened to their cousin, missing for over 50 years "It was very difficult," Mr Lee said. "After the war, even the slightest suggestion that your family had leftist sympathies would leave you open to hostility and hatred." In 2005, South Korea finally established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Its 240 staff have interviewed hundreds of witnesses and relatives of the victims. Last year, they started digging. Just a handful of 160 suspected mass-grave sites have been uncovered so far. In total, they are estimated to contain the remains of more than 100,000 civilian prisoners and suspected leftists. And there is strong evidence to suggest that the 1950 summer of slaughter took place in the full view of South Korea's American allies. 'Internal matter' Photos of the executions, taken by US soldiers, were stamped "secret" and filed away in Washington for years. Their eyewitness accounts were passed to the top of the chain of command. You have to understand the situation at the time, our forces were in a very disadvantaged situation and cornered
Kim Man-sik,
former soldier "There is proof that it was reported to the very top," said Kim Dong-choon, of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. "US soldiers took pictures and reported back to their superiors." News reports have suggested that the Americans saw it as an "internal matter". The British, though, did take some action, seizing "Execution Hill", outside Seoul, to prevent further killings. But 82-year-old Kim Man-sik, one of the few South Koreans left alive who admits to having taken part in the executions, pleads for a fuller understanding of the circumstances of war. In the midst of a civil conflict, with the front line just a few miles away, they say the military police officers under their command felt they had little choice but to follow orders. "On two occasions my unit was told to collect suspected leftists from the police, and we conducted group executions," they said. "But you have to understand the situation at the time, our forces were in a very disadvantaged situation and cornered." Weak mandate The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has until 2010 to complete its task. An uncomfortable truth has been airbrushed from the history of the Korean War, which has long attributed almost all atrocities to the communists in the North. More than half a century on, it is a new generation in the South that are coming to terms with the thought that in war terrible deeds are not only the preserve of the enemy. But the commission cannot compel witnesses to give evidence, nor can it impose any sanctions on the perpetrators. There is concern amongst its supporters that its mandate is too short, and its powers too weak, to do justice to its cause.

As incendiary and dangerous as they are — and they are very dangerous — and as much of a main event as they have been in this election season, Donald Trump is largely a distraction from what really ails our political discourse. Long after they are gone from the scene, the Republican Party that engendered him, facilitated him, and now supports them — despite a severe case of buyer's remorse — will no doubt still thrive, booting up for a future candidacy of Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio or Paul Ryan. And the media will still act as if Trump were an aberration, a departure from so-called “sensible” conservatism. If so, it will be yet another act of media dereliction.
In fact, worse than dereliction, because the Republican Party, with its history of dog-whistle racism, sexism, homophobia, nativism, and gun addiction, salted now by incipient fascism, has been legitimized by the mainstream media for years. One could say that the GOP and MSM have operated in collusion to the great detriment of this country. One could say that and not even be a liberal, just a commonsensical American.

Today's GOP is closer to a religious cult than a political institution.
The MSM continue to treat the Republican Party as if it were just another constellation of ideology and policy — another way of governing the country, even though this campaign season, if not the last 30 years, should have disabused journalists of that notion. Today's GOP is closer to a religious cult than a political institution. It operates on dogma, sees compromise as a moral failing, views enemies as pagans who must be vanquished, and considers every policy skirmish another Götterdämmerung.
That isn't politics; it's a modern version of the medieval Crusades, and as the ancient Crusades did to Europe, it has inflicted untold damage on our country. Because it is deep in the bones of the Republicans, it won't end with Trump, who is a non-believer themselves when it comes to conservative orthodoxy. It can only end with the extinction of the party itself as presently constituted — Cruz, Ryan, Rubio, McConnell, et al. — and the rise of a new conservative party, not a cult.
You won't hear that in the MSM, in large part because, partisan organs like Fox News and MSNBC aside, it tries to maintain that deadly and deadening balance so often discussed and decried by media critics like me. This is a practice that requires a tit for every tat, so that blame can never be leveled against one party unless the media immediately level it against the other as well. Political equipoise, as it were.
Part of this is laziness. Part is fear. The press knows that if it were to come right out and criticize the GOP for its denial of climate change, its campaign to deny the LGBT community its civil rights, its efforts to strip food stamps from children and health insurance from the poor, its systematic attempts to suppress minority voters, its recent howl to protect the Second-Amendment rights of suspected terrorists while at the same time calling for greater surveillance of us all, there would be hell to pay from the right wing, which would invoke the mythical and dreaded “liberal media.” The historian and columnist Eric Alterman calls this “working the refs,” and the MSM fall for it every time.
The media simply won't discuss the Republican Party's values … because when you do so, you can't fake balance.
But there is another reason why the MSM haven't called out the Republican Party, despite its egregious behavior, and this one is especially relevant in this election: The media simply won't discuss the Republican Party's values, as values are the third rail of political journalism. You just don't talk about values, because when you do so, you can't fake balance. We all know that there is a big difference between Republicans and Democrats, and it isn't just a matter of philosophy-cum-policy. It is a matter of what values underlie the parties' philosophies. And, if I may be blunt, Republican values just aren't very consistent with what most of us think when we think of good values.
So the GOP's blatant contradictions, its hate disguised as individual rights and its disdain for the weakest among us, largely go unexamined. Indeed, our media state of affairs is so sad that it largely has fallen to comedians to be our primary truth tellers about what one of our two major parties really stands for — among them, Jon Stewart in their day, Stephen Colbert,John Oliver, and Samantha Bee, whose recent broadcasts on Orlando and guns and on Republican racism have torn the so-called “principled ideological” veil off the GOP and exposed it for what it is: a cult of cranks.
Advertisement:
By rousing the hatefulness within the GOP rank and file, Donald Trump has emboldened a few intrepid MSM journalists to rip off the veil, too — even journalists who treat Paul Ryan as if they were a first-rate intellect. Andrew Rosenthal, the departing editorial page editor atThe New York Times, wrote a blistering takedown of the GOP's refusal to denounce Trump, and Times columnist and Iraq War apologist Thomas Friedman, the very definition of a cautious Big-Foot pundit who slavishly creates and follows the conventional wisdom, called for a reconstituted Republican Party on the basis of “moral bankruptcy.” It is a terrific column. Read it.
Of course, two larks don't an exaltation make, and in any case, both Rosenthal and Friedman are primarily print journalists. Television news still has the longest national reach, and it will never call out the Republican Party no matter what it does, much less examine its values. Instead, we get endless horse-race coverage that turns the election into a long sporting event in which nothing seems to matter except who's winning. We all know that now, and despite the yowls of protest, we also know that it is not likely to change. Political journalists are like sports writers, tracking a team's game plans and checking the score — or, as we call it in politics, the polls.
But what we may fail to notice is that, with all its blather about what states are in play or whose field operation is better or which internecine battles presently engage the candidates' staffs, this kind of coverage is not only a way to juice the political narrative; it's also a way to avoid touching that third rail. So long as we are talking about strategy or who is winning, we don't have to talk about policy (borrrrrrrring!!!) or about values.
Avoiding talking about values is one of the reasons we find ourselves in our current political situation. Doing so might have stopped the threat of Donald Trump. Thirty years ago, it might even have stopped the march of the current Republican Party; its values could have been exposed as indefensible, which could have shamed them (and us) into changing. There is a reason the Republicans contrived the slogan “compassionate conservatism.” It was because even they knew their compassion was dubious. It would have been nice to have the MSM examine that, though, of course, it would have required both the courage to buck the right-wing, who would howl, and the seriousness to discuss just how important values are in our politics. In some measure, because we never got that discussion, for three decades the GOP has gotten off scot-free.
Advertisement:
Now the MSM routinely rebuke Trump, but that easy critique allows them not to have to rebuke the Republican Party itself, whose values, if not their often-changing policy pronouncements, are virtually identical with Trump's, minus their oft-changing policy pronouncements. It is the politesse of a Paul Ryan that Trump lacks in expressing their hostility, and it is that politesse that has conned a gullible, frightened media.
When Trump's candidacy first began taking hold, we were told in the media that Republicans had a Trump problem. As they rose to the top of the GOP presidential heap and rank-and-file Republicans supported them — because of their hateful rhetoric, and not in spite of it — we realized the Republicans had a Republican problem, though, again, the media dare not say it. Now that Trump is the party's presumptive nominee and Republicans are falling into line just as conservatives did in Germany in 1933, we have come to a much graver realization: America has a Republican problem.
This isn't about whom we elect as president. It goes much deeper. This is about who we want to be as a people. For three decades, the MSM have been collaborators with the GOP, pretending the cult is a normal party with values just to the right of center. The result is the proto-fascist Donald Trump and an institution that continues to legitimize what is worst in us.

The spies in our pockets
Your devices - computers, mobile phones, and tablets - are constantly telling others where you are. Your mobile phone in particular is a very effective tracking device: Where you go, it goes, and it records your location all the time - even when you're not connected to the internet.
Location data tells a detailed story
Location information collected over time can tell a surprisingly full story about who you are and what your life looks like. Add publicly-available addresses, tweets, photos, and/or your phone records, and the story gets really detailed.
Location information can reveal not just where you live and work, but also your visits to churches, clinics, bars, friends and lovers; it can show which protests you've participated in, or which political organisations or support groups you're part of.
A map-based visualisation made recently by Open Data City and others shows how this works. Based on 6 months of communications records for Balthasar Glättli, a member of Switzerland's Green Party, the visualisation gives a remarkable amount of insight into Glättli's life.
In Germany, newspaper Die Zeit did a similar thing with the phone records of Green Party politician Malte Spitz, which Spitz got out of their mobile phone provider. The records included logs of calls and texts as well as location, which Zeit used to create a detailed visualisation about their life. Their daily routine was crystal clear, as were any deviations from this routine. (Read more here)
Social Graph mapping
Location data can also be used to map out your relationships with others. If you and another person, or other people, are in the same place at specific times of the day, it's possible to infer what relationships you have with these people - if, for example, they are co-workers, lovers, roommates, or family members. Or, to take another example, if you are a government employee and are in the same cafe as a specific journalist, you could be be flagged as a leaker.
Who wants this information, and why?
This kind of detailed picture can be valuable to all kinds of people and organisations. For one, it can be sold by companies to make money; it can also can be used to predict where you'll be at a given point in the future; it can be used by governments.
Mobile phone towers and your phone
Mobile phone towers
To send and receive calls and messages, your phone must constantly communicate with mobile phone towers. This activity is monitored and logged by your mobile phone provider, allowing them to identify where you are and where you've been.
GPS tracking
Your smartphone is a GPS device. Most smart phones are equipped with a GPS chip and if your phone's 'location services' are on it will communicate with the GPS satellites, allowing you and others to pinpoint your location to a remarkably accurate degree.
Location logs
Location information can then be logged by your phone and various apps on it. Most smartphones have a map app installed, and this goes so far as to log your location as you move, and even store where you've been in the past.
Who has access?
Your location history is accessible to anyone who has, or who can get, access to your phone. It is assumed that Google or Apple also have access to your phone's location log, since they own the location tracking apps in the first place, as well as the Operating Systems (OSs) that almost everyone's phones run on.
See your location logs
Unless you've already turned off location services or frequent locations, your phone is probably logging your location on the device itself. On the iPhone, you can actually can see it mapped out.
If your phone is running iOS7 or a later version, go to Settings –> privacy --> location services --> system services --> frequent locations --> select a city from your history list --> and here's the map.
How do they know where I live?
Again on an iPhone, you might see that the app has already identified and labeled where 'home' and 'work' are. Apple uses an algorithm, or formula, that assumes that if your phone regularly stays in one place at night... that's probably home. And if it stays in another place all day, that must be your workplace.
Are there other ways to map my movements on my phone?
Yes, you could install an app that we recommend called Open Paths (iPhone or Android).
Note: If you install the Open Paths app you will still be giving your personal location data to The New York Times company, who own the app.
Wifi history
There are two main ways your phone can give away location information when Wifi is enabled.
Before you're even connected to a network
You're in a new cafe, and you open your computer. Wifi functionality is on, as always. Hungry to connect, your computer will immediately start looking for a wifi network - but not just any old network. Ideally, it would like to connect to a network it already knows.
To find out if there are any of these in the vicinity, your computer will start broadcasting names of previous networks it has connected to. This could include cafes, workplaces, airports, friends' houses, or community spaces.
Who has access?
The owner of the network, as well as anyone who can hack into this broadcast by, for example, setting up a fake network, could gain quite a detailed picture about where you've been.
Within a network
Some networks are set up with multiple access points - for example, a network that covers a big company or conference building (set up using something like a Wireless Distribution System). Once you're connected to a wifi network like this, your movements can be tracked as you move from one access point to another.
See what this looks like
Visitors to the Re:publica conference in Berlin in 2013 were tracked in this way for a project by Open Data City - you can see their movements on an interactive map, here.
See your wifi history
There is no way to see your wifi connection history on an iPhone or Ipad, though you can delete all of your stored connections by going to
Settings → General → Reset → Reset Network Settings.
On Android phones and on your computer (including Mac), you can see the wifi networks you've connected to before, and delete them individually.
Websites, social media platforms and email providers
IP addresses
When one of your devices connects to the internet, that device is assigned an IP address by the internet service provider of the network you're on (yours, for example, or your work's).
This IP address is a set of numbers that identifies who the internet service provider is, as well as where you are connecting from. The accuracy of this location depends on how that particular provider assigns IP addresses, but it's likely to be somewhere between the street you're in, and the city.
You can check your IP address here.
Who has access?
Unless you're using software that hides your IP, (eg Tor browser or a VPN), your computer shares your IP with every website and social media platform you visit.
Those who have access to your location information therefore include whoever owns the website you're visiting, or who has access to the website's analytics; any company running third party tracking technologies included in the website; or who is able to intercept your internet traffic.
See your recorded locations
Some services, like Gmail, Twitter and Facebook, record your location data in a way that you can access.
In Gmail go to → Details, next to the 'Last account activity' on the right at the bottom of any Gmail page
On Twitter go to → Settings → Your Twitter Data → Login history → enter your password
'Checking in' on social platforms
On some social media platforms like Foursquare, Twitter or Facebook, there is a feature which allows you to 'check in' to a public place like a restaurant, bar, museum, shop, or public building.
Who has access?
Anyone who wants to know. Check in to enough places over enough time, and you create a detailed public record of your movements and routines.
Adding locations to social media posts
Twitter, Facebook and others have the option to add your location to your post or tweets.
Who has access?
Unless your account is private or protected, this too could mean that what you're actually doing is creating a detailed public record of your movements and routines.
Even if your account is only visible to a closed network of people, remember that things you post - including information about your location and movements - can still be shared by people in this network. This can happen by accident or because of lack of privacy awareness.
See your public location data
The website Please Rob Me shows you a stream of your location data, as shared via Twitter, Foursquare etc, so you might think harder next time you're tempted to announce this information.
"The danger is publicly telling people where you are. This is because it leaves one place you're definitely not... home." (From the website Please Rob Me)
Your browser history
How does my browser history reveal where I've been?
Some search engines, like Google, see where you are from (your IP address), and then redirect you to a local version of their search engine. If you're in Germany and you type in Google.com, you get redirected to Google.de, or in Costa Rica it will be Google.co.cr, and in Hong Kong Google.hk.
And the websites you visit are usually stored in your browser history (unless you have disabled this function, or clear your browser history regularly).
Who has access?
Anyone who has access to your computer or your browser. This includes trackers (go here for more on browser tracking technology.
See your browser history
On your computer:
Firefox: history → show all history
Chrome: history → show full history
On iPhone OS:
Settings → find the browser you use → advanced → website data
On Android:

Open Chrome: History
Photos, Google Maps and other sources of location data
If you have location information on your phone turned on for pictures, this information will get embedded in the picture (ie, the picture's metadata will include where you took the picture). When you send or upload these pictures you can share your location data without thinking about it. Most social media providers extract location data when you upload the picture, but there are still many ways in which location data can be aggregated from the pictures you share.
Aljazeera's Ask the Decoder column has a story that illustrates this quite well: (Oct 8 2014):
In the summer of 2014, Android user Jean Yang returned from a trip through Europe to find a surprise package in their Google+ notifications: an organised photo scrapbook titled "Trip". They hadn't requested this, and hadn't notified Google that they were going on holiday.
But they didn't need to. Google's algorithms could pick up the break in routine, and take an obvious guess that they were on holiday.
Google+ was able to organise their photos using a combination of information sources: geotags on photos (information embedded in the photos, providing the longitude and latitude of where the photo was taken), location information from Google Now or Maps, and GPS data. Google's algorithms could have also identified locations using machine vision to match key landmarks. By the end of the trip - despite the fact that Jean's phone was actually off most of the time - Google was able to pull together enough information to organize their photos in a location timeline.

Control your data: Simple how-to's
The federation, however, says that socioeconomic factors considered by insurers to set rates, such as occupation and education, are proxies for income. In its analysis, the group assigned one of the hypothetical drivers certain attributes typical of an upper-income American, including having a master's degree and a job as a bank executive; it gave the other a high school diploma and work as a bank teller. (The “tested” drivers shared certain basic characteristics: Each was female, 30 years old, licensed for 14 years and drove a 2006 Toyota Camry 10,000 miles a year.)
The study found that quotes varied among the insurers — Allstate, Farmers, Geico, Progressive and State Farm. State Farm was the most likely to charge the good driver less, regardless of socioeconomic status, the analysis found.
Progressive and Geico, the report said, were more likely to charge upper-income bad drivers less than good drivers with moderate incomes. In Queens, for example, Progressive quoted $6,404 for the moderate-income clean driver and $3,020 for an upper-income driver with a drunken-driving conviction. Progressive declined to comment.
Geico referred a request for comment to the Insurance Information Institute, which publishes a list of criteria used to set auto rates.
James Lynch, chief actuary with the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group, said the researchers' methodology did not necessarily reflect what actually happened in the marketplace. For instance, they said, it was difficult for someone with a drunken-driving conviction to obtain coverage at all, never mind at a rate lower than that of a safe driver.
Doug Heller, an insurance expert with the federation and an author of the study, said they agreed that it was harder for a driver with an alcohol conviction to find coverage but added that it was generally easier than it once was to get insurance with a bad driving record.
Los Angeles was the only market in which the safer but less affluent driver consistently paid less for coverage than the wealthy driver with the bad record, the study found. Mr. Heller said that was because California had strong consumer protections governing auto insurance rates. The state, for instance, explicitly bars the use of a driver's previous insurance coverage history in setting rates, they said.

Former Chelsea and France midfielder Claude Makelele has praised Alvaro Morata (Picture: Getty)
Claude Makelele has heaped praise on Alvaro Morata, insisting they are in no doubt that the Chelsea summer signing will continue their fine goalscoring record.
Antonio Conte signed Morata from Real Madrid in July after missing out on Belgian talisman Romelu Lukaku, who joined rivals Manchester United.
Solskjaer sends message to struggling Man Utd star ahead of Crystal Palace clash
Morata endured a difficult start to their career at Stamford Bridge and missed a penalty in the Community Shield defeat to Arsenal in August.
But the 24-year-old has adapted quickly to their new surroundings, scoring seven goals for the Blues including a superb hat-trick against Stoke City last month.
‘He's a good player, strong player, competitor and international,' Chelsea legend Makelele told Sky Sports.
Morata has impressed following their high-profile move from Real Madrid (Picture: Getty)
‘This is the top level. They were at the best team in the world Real Madrid, they scored goals there. He's gone to Juventus, they scored goals there. Of course they will score goals at Chelsea.'

Morata pulled up with a hamstring injury during Chelsea's defeat to Manchester City but will be ‘very happy' in west London playing under Conte, according to Makelele.
‘It's tough in the Premier League, very tough,' the former France midfielder added. ‘I think they understand the Premier League.
‘He understands also where he's going to play, you want to give them more balls. I think he's going to be happy at Chelsea, for sure.'

A driver wanted for speeding led police over freeways and surface streets before ultimately running onto the USC campus, where they captured. Kate Larsen reports for the NBC4 News at 11 p.m. on Oct. 10, 2013. (Published Thursday, Oct. 10, 2013)
A police chase ended Thursday night on the University of Southern California campus, after the driver faked surrender then took off toward the school.
After multiple failed attempts, a California Highway Patrol officer spun out the driver, who stopped and was surrounded by gun-wielding officers near Adams Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. It appeared they were going to surrender, but nearly a minute later, the driver took off again.
At least one of those officers opened fire at the driver after the pit manuever, CHP told NBC4. No one was hurt, but it was not immediately clear why the officer fired at the driver.
They drove their dark-colored sedan through surface streets in Exposition Park then onto USC campus near Vermont Avenue and 37th Street. The driver headed into a dead end, where they parked their car and ran.
At least one person -- believed to be the wanted driver -- has been arrested, Newschopper4 reports.
It appeared the handcuffed man had blood on the front of their t-shirt, according to ground footage from the scene.
USC students received vague messages (pictured at right) from campus saying an incident was resolved, shortly before 9 p.m.
The chase skirted around a packed LA Coliseum, where the USC football team was in its second quarter against the University of Arizona.
It was not immediately known why the driver was being sought or where the chase began.
NBC4's Kate Larsen contributed to this report.
When they were still the governor of Bavaria, Edmund Stoiber seized every opportunity to curse Brussels officialdom. So it ought to give pause to people that the same Stoiber is today lamenting a "renaissance of nationalism" in European capitals. "I am concerned that Europe is crumbling," the former leader of Bavaria's conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) party said in Brussels last week. They have been appointed by the European Commission to reduce EU bureaucracy.
The Schengen Agreement eliminating internal border controls is considered to be a milestone of European integration. No single European Union policy has generated as much enthusiasm among the citizens of Europe as the freedom of borderless travel. Driven by the EU-critical and latently xenophobic Danish People's Party, the move by the Danish government this week to reintroduce border controls, even if only spot checks, is shaking the foundations of Europe.
The development is serious, and is part of a trend. Anti-Europeansare on the rise in other parts of Europe as well. In Holland, a minority government is tolerated by right-wing populist Geert Wilders, in France President Nicolas Sarkozy is competing for votes in the upcoming election with Marine Le Pen of the Front National and in Italy, the right-wingers in Umberto Bossi's Lega Nord are part of the government.
It was Rome and Paris that first announced they would partially reintroduce border controls. The reason was negligible, and the step was motivated purely by politics. Around 30,000 refugees from North Africa had landed on the coasts of Italy and Malta. By comparison: During the 1990s, more than 100,000 refugees fled from Kosovo to Europe, but nobody at the time threatened to dispose of the right of Europeans to border-free internal travel.
But something has changed fundamentally since the 1990s. Europe's nations are no longer ruled by dyed-in-the-wool champions of the European project like Helmut Kohl, François Mitterand or Felipe Gonzales, but by cool and calculating politicians like Angela Merkel or political egocentrics such as Nicolas Sarkozy. The main difference between these politicians and the right-wing populists is in ther methods: Whereas the populists openly proclaim their desire to exit the EU, the others are eliminating the political union bit by bit.
Europe's Guardian Has Little Endurance
In Germany, for example, Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich of the CSU, the sister party to Chancellor Merkel's Christian Democratic Union(CDU) may have sharply criticized Denmark, France and Italy for going it alone and implementing border controls. At the same time, however, they expressed their understanding for the idea that there might be a need to reintroduce border controls temporarily during emergency situations. And they also want to leave it up to EU member states to make those decisions -- in other words, let political opportunism dictate matters -- and not the European Commission, which is able to act free of domestic political considerations.
The same also holds true for the EU's second great achievement, whose future is also at stake right now: the common currency. Appeals like "the euro is our common fate" are too vague to get across to the people. The truth is more concrete: Why doesn't Angela Merkel state that, each year, Germany exports more goods to the Netherlands than the supposedly massive Chinese market? Then, at least, every German would understand why we profit from the fact that our companies are no longer exposed to the risks of currency exchange rates in Europe.
Instead of providing a clear vision, the chancellor is busily engaged in backroom dealmaking, just like their predecessor Gerhard Schröder was before them Working together with then-French President Jacques Chirac, they weakened the Stability Pact for the euro and violated the common currency zone rule -- that annual deficit spending cannot exceed three percent of gross domestic product -- several years in a row. And though Merkel insists that the stability criteria must be adhered to, when it comes to the question of how violations should be punished, their strict stance evaporates. During their walk along the seaside in Deauville, France, last autumn with President Sarkozy, they yielded and said they would no longer insist on automatic sanctions for countries that violate the budget deficit rules.
At the very least, the European Parliament must take firm stance this time. It has the power of co-decision when it comes to reforming the Stability Pact and has so far been insisting on automatic sanctions -- one of the reasons a deal on a second bailout package for Greece has been delayed until autumn. The parliament has proven to be the true guardian of European integration in terms of both Schengen and the euro. The European Commission caved in on both those issues. On the Stability Pact, Commission officials argued behind the scenes for a compromise. And despite its early criticism of the Danish border controls, the Commission no longer sees anything wrong with them.
One would expect a bit more steadfastness from a European Commission that views itself as being the "guardian of the European treaties."

Welcome to Cool Comics in My Collection Episode 58, where we take a nostalgic look at comic books I currently own, and in some sad cases, ones that I let get away.
For each of the comic books I include in this blog, I list the current secondary market value. This is according to the listings at the website www.comicbookrealm.com. They list out the near mint prices, which are on the comic book grading scale of 9.4. If you go to the website to look up any in your collection, you can click on the price and see the value at different grades. Not all of my comics are 9.4. Some are probably better, and some are worse. But to simplify it, that's the grading price I use here. And remember, a comic book is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it.
Have you considered being a guest host for Cool Comics? You can do a theme or just pick any of your comics for inclusion (this blog is for all ages, so please keep that in mind), with a maximum of seven issues. Repeat guest hosts are permitted and encouraged. Send your completed blog to edgosney62@gmail.com.
If you have any questions or comments, please scroll to the bottom of the page to where it says, “Leave a reply.” I hope you enjoy seeing these as much as I do writing about them. And now, Episode 58…
Cool comics in my collection #357: The Amazing Spider-Man #142, March 1975.
Mysterio is a long-time Spider-Man villain, first appearing in The Amazing Spider-Man #13 in June 1964. Regardless, I've never been a fan. Not that I'd turn down issue 13 if someone wanted to give me a copy (and that's not going to happen!), but to me he's just not a fun character. But that's beside the point. This issue starts off the Gwen Stacy clone saga. When the big Spider-Clone saga ran from 1994-1996, fans were scrambling to get these back issues from the Seventies, especially issue #149. Of course, as a proud Spider-Man collector in the Seventies, I was one of the fortunate ones who already owned these issues. Later, some people started putting down both the original clone story (and the later one in the Nineties), but I remember with fondness how exciting it was each month to run to the little store in Martins Ferry, Ohio, where I bought my comics, then get back to my bedroom so I could live these moments with Peter Parker. Great memories. The cover price of The Amazing Spider-Man #142 is 25 cents, while the current value is $55.
Cool comics in my collection #358: Captain Marvel #6, October 1968.
When this comic book came out in 1968, I would have soon been turning six years old, and I'm not sure I even knew what a comic book was. But if I had known, surely I would have convinced my parents to buy me this issue of Captain Marvel. Well, probably not. More than likely I would have asked for a Batman comic book, because they had the coolest TV show at the time. And Mar-Vell wasn't a character I started exploring until the Nineties. I can remember seeing the Captain Marvel comics on the store shelves, but the only Captain Marvel I really knew at all at the time was the Big Red Cheese. Yet there was something about this Kree warrior that caught my attention, and since the Nineties I've been slowly collecting back issues of this series when I can find them at a decent price. I wish I had them all, but part of the fun is in the chase. The cover price of Captain Marvel #6 is 12 cents, while the current value is $70.
Cool comics in my collection #359: World's Finest Comics #226, November 1974.
Back when I was a kid collecting comic books in the Seventies, the best bang for your buck was DC's 100 page giants. That's right, 100 pages for just 60 cents! I've covered all the 100 page giants I bought in my little home town of Martins Ferry, Ohio, in this blog over the past 50 some episodes, so now I'll start covering the ones I bought as back issues. Recently, I decided I needed more of these thick comics packed with plenty of stories, so I visited my local comic shop, Kenmore Komics, and picked some up, then went back again and got even more. The one featured here cost me $10, which is a lot more than the cover price, but when collecting older issues, you quite often have to dish out more cash. One of the things I like about the World's Finest title is the variety of characters you get. This issue features Superman, Batman, Deadman, Metamorpho, Eclipso, Sandman, the Martian Manhunter, and more! The cover price of World's Finest Comics #226 is 60 cents, while the current value is $55.
Recently Read
If you've been reading this blog for any length of time, you know that my favorite period of comic books is the Seventies. And it doesn't take a genius to figure out why. It's the period when I started collecting as a kid, and part of the joy and lore of this hobby is the nostalgic feelings we get looking at the issues that were so important to us as kids. Ms. Marvel's original series began in 1977, a time when my comic book buying habits were slowing down, so I didn't bother considering buying it when it came out. But I started finding back issues of it in the mid to late Nineties, and continued picking up an issue here or there when I could find them at a decent price. Finally, this year, I picked up two of the last three issues I needed. But I couldn't find issue #9 anywhere. I considered buying it via mail-order or eBay, but decided to wait for a while. And the next thing you know, just a couple months ago, my daughter's boyfriend, Ryan, surprised me with a gift of Ms. Marvel #9! Finally, I'd be able to read all 23 issues chronologically. And it was something to savor, as the ads are just as important as the story. These are little time portals to my past, and I love every minute of the experience. Sure, the stories are dated, but I lived through the period, so I understood the issues the writers covered. If you've set any goals to complete a collection of a run, more power to you!
Stronger collective bargaining is part of the solution to stop wage stagnation, according to a new report.
Stronger collective bargaining is part of the solution to stop wage stagnation, says new report
A new report published by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) warns of stagnating wages in many countries and points to the labour market as the main driver of inequality.
The Global Wage Report shows that wage growth around the world slowed in 2013 to 2.0 per cent compared to 2.2 per cent in 2012 and has yet to catch up with the 2008 pre-crisis rates of about 3 per cent.
Even modest growth in global wages was driven largely by emerging G20 economies, where wages increased by 6.75 per cent in 2012 and 5.9 per cent in 2013.
The reports say that average wage growth in developed economies has fluctuated around 1 per cent per year since 2006 and then slowed further in 2012 and 2013 to only 0.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively.
“Wage growth has slowed to almost zero for the developed economies as a group in the last two years, with actual declines in wages in some,” said Sandra Polaski, the ILO's deputy director-general for policy.
“This has weighed on overall economic performance, leading to sluggish household demand in most of these economies and the increasing risk of deflation in the Eurozone,” they added.
Kristen Sobeck, economist at the ILO said:
“The last decade shows a slow convergence of average wages in emerging and developing countries towards those of developed economies, but wages in developed economies remain on average about three times higher than in the group of emerging and developing economies.”
Among developing economies, the report notes vast differences between global regions.
For example, in 2013, wages grew by 6 per cent in Asia and 5.8 per cent in Eastern Europe and Central Asia but only 0.8 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean. In the Middle East, wages appear to have advanced by 3.9 per cent, but only by 0.9 per cent in Africa.
Labour productivity – the value of goods and services produced per person employed – continues to outstrip wage growth in developed economies.
The growing gap between wages and productivity has translated into a declining share of GDP going to workers while an increasing share goes to capital, especially in developed economies. Working families are getting a smaller share of economic growth while the owners of capital are enjoying massive economic gains.
The report carries a detailed analysis of recent trends in household income inequality and the role played by wages in these trends.
The report shows that in developed economies, wages frequently represent 70 to 80 per cent of household income in households with at least one member of working age.
In emerging and developing economies, where ‘self-employment' is higher the contribution of wages to household income is usually smaller, ranging from about 50 to 60 per cent in Mexico, the Russian Federation, Argentina, Brazil and Chile to about 40 per cent in Peru, or 30 per cent in Vietnam.
“In many countries, inequality starts in the labour market, and particularly in the distribution of wages and employment,” said Rosalia Vazquez-Alvarez, econometrician and wage specialist at the ILO and a co-author of the report.
Recent inequality trends have been mixed, but in a majority of countries where inequality has increased, such as in the USA and Spain changes in wages and employment have been the dominant force.
Where inequality has been reduced, such as in Brazil, Argentina and Russia wages and increased employment have been a driving force in reducing inequality.
As Sandra Polaski of the ILO concludes:
“A comprehensive strategy is needed which will include minimum wage policies, strengthened collective bargaining, elimination of discrimination against vulnerable groups, as well as progressive taxation polices and adequate social protection systems.”

Pathway
Subjects engage in various behaviors that encompass part of research, planning, or preparation for a terrorist act or implementation of such an attack.5
On June 5, 1968, on the first anniversary of the Six Day War, Sirhan Sirhan carried out the meticulously planned assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. After months of preparation, they conducted the attack following Kennedy's vote to sell 50 Phantom jet fighter-bombers to Israel in January 1968. Although not Muslim Sirhan identified closely with the Palestinians and viewed Kennedy's vote as a betrayal of their people.6
In the 5 months leading up to the date, they secured a .22-caliber revolver, practiced at a shooting range, made at least four approaches—perhaps failed attempts or efforts to see how close they could get—to Kennedy in a public venue and, finally, shot them multiple times while hiding in the pantry at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California, as Kennedy walked past him.7 There were 77 people in the pantry at the time, but there also was no U.S. Secret Service policy in place to protect aspiring presidential candidates until after this assassination.8
Fixation
Certain behaviors indicate someone's increasingly pathological preoccupation with a person or cause.9 There is an accompanying deterioration in relationships or occupational performance.
Malik Hasan, the U.S. Army major who conducted a mass murder at Ft. Hood, Texas, on November 5, 2009, became increasingly fixated by their belief that the United States was at war with Islam. During their residency and fellowship at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., they openly articulated their beliefs to other psychiatric residents, fellows, and supervisors.10 Hasan gave two presentations entitled “The Koranic Worldview as It Relates to Muslims in the Military” and “Why the War on Terror Is a War on Islam.”11
In the months preceding the killings, the fixation continued with efforts to avoid deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan by retaining an attorney; they also communicated via e-mail with Anwar al-Awlaki, an American spiritual sanctioner and recruiter for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in Yemen.12 They inquired whether killing American soldiers and officers was a religiously legitimate act.13 The arguing and preaching stopped during this period, but clandestine operational planning likely continued.14 Their fixation was a cause, but also was deeply personal because their grievance against the wars in the Middle East went unheeded.15
Identification
Persons have a psychological desire to be a “pseudocommando” or have a “warrior mentality.” This includes closely associating with weapons or other military or law enforcement paraphernalia, identifying with previous attackers or assassins, or proclaiming themselves as agents to advance a particular cause or belief system.16
Anders Breivik carried out the July 22, 2011, bombings on several Norwegian government buildings and, within hours, killed another 69 people—mostly adolescents—on the island of Utoya. They identified themselves as a contemporary reincarnation of the Knights Templar, the militant spear of the 12th-century Christian Crusades against the Muslims.17
Breivik designed homemade uniforms, emblematic of their identification, to wear in photographs and also found an affinity for U.S. terrorists Ted Kaczynski and Timothy McVeigh.18 They plagiarized the writings of Kaczynski in their own “2083—A European Declaration of Independence” and wrote that McVeigh probably felt as they did while constructing their bombs.19 Breivik considered themselves a soldier fighting to free their people from multiculturalism and the Islamic immigration into Europe.20
Novel Aggression
For the first time, subjects commit an act of violence that appears unrelated to any pathway behavior. They do so to test their ability to become violent.
On October 22, 2014, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau murdered Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a Canadian soldier, and injured three others. Then, they attacked the Canadian Parliament, wherein they were killed by law enforcement. Three years earlier, in December 2011, they had walked into the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) field office in Burnaby, British Columbia, and said they wanted to be arrested for an armed robbery they committed a decade earlier; no such recorded crime existed.21 The next night, they tried to rob a McDonald's restaurant with a pencil, then waited for the police to arrive.22 They told them, “I'm a crack addict and at the same time a religious person, and I want to sacrifice freedom and good things for a year maybe, so when I come out I'll appreciate things in life more and be clean.”23
Energy Burst
An increase in the frequency or variety of noted activities—even if relatively innocuous—related to the target occurs, usually in the hours or days before the attack.
On January 8, 2011, in Tucson, Arizona, Jared Loughner tried to assassinate U.S. Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and committed mass murder.24 In the 12 hours before the attack, beginning before midnight, they dropped off a roll of 35-mm film to be developed at a local drug store and later picked up the photos, checked into a motel, and intermittently searched the Internet, using the key words “assassin” and “lethal injection.”25 They left a telephone message for a friend and, at 4:12 a.m., posted to their social media page a photo of their Glock pistol with the words “goodbye friends….”26
At 7:27 a.m., they visited two department stores and purchased 9-mm full metal jacket ammunition and a diaper bag.27 Later, police stopped them for running a red light; they were released with a warning after crying and apologizing.28 Loughner went home, then ran away from their father when confronted.29 They returned to a department store, then took a cab to the shopping center where Congresswoman Giffords was speaking, insisting on getting correct change for the cab driver because they only had a $20 bill.30 A few minutes later at 10:10 a.m., they opened fire, killing 6 people and wounding 13. They had taken the time to put their driver's license, credit card, and money in a small plastic baggie.31
Leakage
When planning to harm a target through an attack, persons communicate such intent to a third party.32
On August 8, 2014, Abdurasul Juraboev, a resident of Brooklyn, New York, and a citizen of Uzbekistan, wrote on a website, “Greetings! I am in U.S. right now, but we don't have any arms. But, is it possible to commit ourselves as dedicated martyrs anyway while here? What I'm saying is to shoot Obama and get shot ourselves, will it do? That will strike fear in the hearts of infidels.”33 In February 2015 they were indicted with two other individuals and currently awaits federal prosecution for attempt and conspiracy to provide material support to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).34
Last Resort
Subjects demonstrate through word or deed a violent action or time imperative or display increasing desperation or distress.35 To such individuals, there is no alternative other than violence, and the consequences are justified.
On June 17, 2015, 21-year-old Dylann Storm Roof committed mass murder at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. They killed nine African-Americans during a Bible study meeting, including the senior pastor and Senator Clementa Pinckney, and wounded several others.
Days after the shooting, their website, The Last Rhodesian, was discovered, including a manifesto.36 Roof had written, “I have no choice. I am not in the position to, alone, go into the ghetto and fight. I chose Charleston because it is the most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country. We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the Internet. Well, someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.”37
Directly Communicated Threat
Individuals communicate a direct threat to the target or law enforcement before a violent action.
On December 11, 2010, Taimour al-Abdaly, a 28-year-old Iraqi Sunni living in Sweden since age 10, carried out a car bombing and then prematurely detonated their own suicide vest in downtown Stockholm, killing no one else. They sent an audiotaped message in several different languages to Swedish broadcast media shortly before their targeted violence.
You have Lars Vilks—the pig Lars Vilks—to blame, and yourselves for these actions. Your quietness for the painting and your support for your soldiers, now understand, brought you to this unpleasant situation.
The Islamic state, may Allah protect it, and its people have now begun to fulfill its promises. And do know one thing: we are not—we are not a lie or imagination, we are for real and do now exist among you, Europeans. So stop your drawings and—stop your drawings of our prophet Muhammad [Arabic], withdraw your soldiers from Afghanistan and no more oppression against Islam or Muslims will be tolerated in any way or any means.
Last but not least, I say to all mujahedeen: please do not forgive [sic] me in your prayers, may Allah accept me as a martyr and my request from you is to pray [Arabic phrase] for me as the Muslims are so humiliated here in Sweden and other places in Europe that they sometimes pray for non-Muslims. And to all hidden mujahedeen in Europe, and especially in Sweden: it's now the time to strike, even if you only have a knife to strike with, and I do know you that have more than that.38
INVESTIGATIVE USEFULNESS
Although these warning behaviors appear to be proximal indicators of accelerating risk in individual terrorists, further scientific testing is necessary. Some efforts already have begun. In a small study comparing German school shooters with other students of concern, five of the warning behaviors—pathway, fixation, identification, novel aggression, and last resort—significantly discriminated the shooters from the other students who had no intent to act.39 These differences showed a large effect size, indicating a strong relationship between the shooter's violence and the five warning behaviors. Recent research has demonstrated striking similarities between individual terrorists, mass murderers, and active shooters.40
In two other studies, the Swedish Defence Research Agency recommended and outlined a method to employ three of the warning behaviors—fixation, identification, and leakage—to potentially identify “lone wolves” through the use of forensic linguistic analysis and data mining on the Internet.41 The warning behaviors also appear to have ecological validity—a real-world fit—across several different domains of targeted violence perpetrators, including German school shooters, German and American public figure attackers or assassins, and spousal homicide malefactors.42
The author and their colleagues are in the process of analyzing data concerning individual terrorists—religious and secular motivations—in North America and Europe. In a study of 22 European terrorists, five warning behaviors (pathway, fixation, identification, energy burst, and last resort) were found in more than 90 percent of the cases. In another larger study of 111 lone-actor terrorists in the United States and Europe, pathway, fixation, identification, and leakage were present in 77 to 96 percent of all subjects. Such efforts will demonstrate whether these behaviors have value as part of an instrument for risk-assessment efforts.
CONCLUSION
These proximal warning behaviors can be used to make decisions concerning whether a case should be monitored or mitigated for risk management. The absence of all warning behaviors following a detailed investigation—always remembering that insufficient information does not mean absent information—would suggest that monitoring and intelligence gathering continue, but that active risk management for targeted violence is unnecessary. The presence of one warning behavior could indicate that active risk management should be pursued and specific interventions developed within the fact pattern of the individual case. Although these warning behaviors were developed to identify indicators for targeted violence, they appear to complement specific interactive patterns recently promulgated by the National Counterterrorism Center concerning ISIL- or al Qaeda-inspired violence and can function best as another investigative tool as further operational research accumulates.43
Artist's depiction of the gas giant planet in orbit around the red dwarf star TYC 9486-927-1, faintly visible in the background.
Scientists used to suspect a giant planet named "2MASS J2126-8140" was a rogue world, wandering the galaxy without a star to orbit. But it turns out the planet isn't homeless after all: its star is just very, very far away. Like, a trillion kilometers away (or about 621,000,000,000 miles).
To put that number into context, that's around 6,900 times the distance between the Sun and Earth. Its orbit is 140 times wider than Pluto's. At that distance, the dim red dwarf star would look like just another moderately bright star in the sky.
Astronomer Simon Murphy from the Australian National University and their colleagues uncovered the secret relationship between the planet and star after noticing that they were both located 100 light-years from Earth. Further analysis showed they were moving together as well.
The planet is believed to be a gas giant 12 to 15 times the size of Jupiter, and takes nearly a million Earth years to circle its star.
Scientists aren't sure how such a far-flung solar system could have formed. “There is no way it formed in the same way as our solar system did, from a large disc of dust and gas,” Murphy said in a press statement.
Instead, the team suspects the star-planet duo were born relatively recently (10 to 45 million years ago, compared to our solar system's birth 4.5 billion years ago), and that they formed from “a filament of gas that pushed them together in the same direction," says Murphy.
"They must not have lived their lives in a very dense environment. They are so tenuously bound together that any nearby star would have disrupted their orbit completely.”
Spiš Castle among top 500 ultimate bucket list destinations
THE SPIŠ Castle, situated in northern Slovakia, was listed among the 500 best places to see on the planet which should be part of the bucket list for every type of traveller created by Lonely Planet's globetrotting community of staff and writers.
In the “Ultimate Travelist”, Lonely Planet's team of travel experts and authors on the ground rated the world's best mega-sights and hidden gems, bringing together what they believe to be the 500 best places to visit in the world, the company reported on its website.
The list is topped by the Temples of Angkor in Cambodia, followed by the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and Machu Picchu in Peru.
Aside from the best-of list regulars, culled from UNESCO's World Heritage roster or Lonely Planet's own country-by-country highlights, there are a few surprises. The top 20 list, for example, includes Tasmania's Museum of Modern and Old Art and Fez's Medina, rubbing shoulders with travel titans such as the Grand Canyon and the Taj Mahal, the CNN.com website reported.
“This book has been years in the making and brings together the most compelling places in the world according to our team of globetrotting travel experts,” said Tom Hall, editorial director of Lonely Planet, as quoted on the website of Lonely Planet. “Every traveller has got a list of places they simply have to see – places heard about, read about or dreamed about. Of course, what makes somewhere special is different for everyone and we'd love to hear about other people's top spots. But this is our definitive list. And one we hope will inspire many other travel wish lists.”

The second line centre on the U.S. National Team Development Program U-18 squad, Trent Frederic comes from a very athletic family. Their brother Grant plays for the Green Bay Gamblers of the USHL, older sister K.C. played volleyball at Oregon State University and older brother Gene played football at the University of Memphis. Trent Frederic had a strong season with the US NTDP putting up 20 goals and 20 assists for 40 points in 61 games. They added four goals and seven points in seven games as the US took home bronze at the 2016 World Under 18 Hockey Championship. They also took home a silver at the 2015 World Under 17 Hockey Challenge. Frederic is committed to play for the University of Wisconsin Badgers next year. Should they change their mind and elect to go the CHL route, their rights are owned by the Niagara Ice Dogs.
Trent Frederic Scouting Report: 2016 NHL Draft #58
Centre/Left Wing — shoots Left
Born Feb 11 1998 — St. Louis, MO
Height 6'02” — Weight 201 lbs [188 cm / 91 kg]
Trent Frederic shows good size, and plays a power forward style of game. They love to get in on the fore check, pressuring defencemen, and throwing hits in the offensive zone. They create turnovers, and generates offence by winning battles along the boards or working to establish space in front of the net. They protect the puck well down low, and is able to prolong possession and generate plays. Frederic has the ability to score goals, with a strong wrist shot and good release.  They are also able to score in close, taking the puck to the net when they get the opportunity, or throw fast hands that get rebounds and deflections. In terms of stick handling Frederic protects the puck well, but they are not one to make a lot of fancy ones on one moves. Their passing game also relies on making the simple play and does not typically look for the overly fancy or creative play. Frederic shows good hockey IQ, finding open space away from defenders, and making smart safe plays.
Frederic is a good skater. They have the speed and acceleration necessary to be dangerous off the rush, or be the first one in on the fore check. They could use some work on their edge work and agility, as they can sometimes have issues navigating through traffic. Frederic shows good power in their stride, with the ability to fight through checks and the balance to win battles on the boards as well as establish position in front of the net.
For a young player, Frederic is already developing a strong defensive game.  They are tenacious on the back check and willing to use their size and grittiness in all three zones. Frederic is a smart player who contains well against the cycle game and provides good back pressure.  They are good in the face-off circle, and does a good job cutting down passing and shooting lanes on the penalty kill.
It is unclear if Frederic has the agility, creativity and vision to play centre at the next level. A move to left wing may be in their future, as they do a good job of playing a simple straight ahead game, and has the offensive ability to score goals. The question will be if their offence develops enough in the next few years to see them as a second line or third line player. Frederic's game is similar to David Backes of the St. Louis Blues from a stylistic perspective, but this is not a talent comparison or analysis based on potential.
The following is a compilation of Trent Frederic highlights, assembled from youtube.
Check back tomorrow for the #59 prospect on our NHL Draft Board.

The hero who gave up their soup to confront the man yelling the n-word at L train riders turns out to be none other than NYC rapper Princess Nokia. In a series of tweets early this morning Princess Nokia (Destiny Frasqueri) described the incident and got a shoutout from Kimya Dawson:
And yes I threw hot soup in this mans face and kicked them off off the train , and kicked in the face.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Sunday declared that the administration does not see peace and stability in Syria with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad still in power.
On Sunday's "Meet The Press," Haley told host Chuck Todd, "In no way do we look at peace happening in that area with Iranian influence. In no way do we see peace in that area with Russia covering up for Assad. In no way do we see peace in that area with Assad as the head of the Syrian government.”
"We have to make sure that we're pushing that process," they continued. “The political solution has to come together for the good of the people of Syria."
Haley noted that the United States' first priority is still to defeat ISIS, but that there can be "multiple priorities."
"So you know, of course, it's to defeat ISIS," they said. "I mean, we've got to do that for peace and stability in the area. It's also to get out the Iranian influence, which we think is causing so much friction and worse issues in the area. And then we've got to go and make sure that we actually see a leader that will protect their people. And clearly, Assad is not that person."

On Thursday night, President Trump ordered Tomahawk cruise missile strikes on a Syrian airfield in response to what the United States believes was a chemical weapons attack at the hands of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
The strikes have raised a slew of questions about the Trump administration's ultimate goals for Syria. Haley said on Sunday that it was up to the United States to take some burden in reacting to atrocities like this.
"The United States fought for the people of Syria and told Assad, 'No more,'" Haley said. "And I think that's something that was strong for the United States to do. And I think it was needed. I think we desperately needed to send a message that, 'You know what? Russia's not going to have your back anymore. And if they do, we're going to make sure that both of you know that we're not going to settle for it.'"
But Haley also said that it shouldn't be dependent on the United States to take more military action to achieve what they want to see.
"I think that's dependent on the actors that are at play," said Haley, the former governor of South Carolina. "I mean, this is a very complicated situation. We know there's no easy solution to the crisis that's in Syria. But our focus is to make sure that, you know, we're focused on strengthening the cease fire."
Also on "Meet The Press," Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, brought up Haley's comments about Assad and claimed, "I've never been more encouraged by the Trump Administration as I am today," interpreting their remarks as "regime change is now the policy of the Trump Administration."
"I'm glad Trump did this," Graham added. "He is no longer Obama in the eyes of our enemies, but they need to do more to close the deal. There's a new sheriff in town."
Graham also used some blunt words for the fallout from the strikes, saying, "Assad's telling Trump by flying from this base: 'F you.'" After missiles struck the airfield, jets were seen taking off again.
Ambassador Haley also questioned Russia's first reactions to the attack. Russia is backing Assad's regime in Syria's ongoing civil war.
"You know, the interesting thing, Chuck, is, when this chemical weapons murder happened to so many people, Russia's reaction was not, 'Oh, how horrible,' or, 'How could they do this to innocent children,' or, 'How awful is that?' Their initial reaction was, 'Assad didn't do it. The Syrian government didn't do it,'" Haley said.
Moscow called the U.S. airstrike an "act of aggression" and an "egregious and obvious violation of international law that cannot be justified."
"Why were they that defensive that quick?" asked Haley. "The idea of the casualties came after. The first priority for them was to cover for Assad."
Graham wants to see more sanctions on Russia, not only for their apparent attempts at interfering with the 2016 election, but also for what they charged as "aiding and abetting the use of chemical weapons by a war criminal, Assad."
Related: Was the U.S. Missile Strike on Syria Legal?
The strikes this week were a startling reversal from many of Trump's comments as a citizen. Over the last several years, they repeatedly warned against the United States military intervention into the Syrian conflict, sending tweets like, "We should stay the hell out of Syria, the "rebels" are just as bad as the current regime. WHAT WILL WE GET FOR OUR LIVES AND $ BILLIONS?ZERO."
Haley declined to speculate on where the president was coming from at that point.
"I don't know what their thought process was in 2013," they said. "And I'm not going to attempt to try and explain that. What I can tell you is, through the meetings we had all this week, what you saw was a president that was disgusted by what the Assad regime did to those innocent people."
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Sunday said there was "no change" in the U.S. military position on Syria following Thursday's strike.
"We are asking Russia to fulfill its commitment and we're asking and calling on Bashar al-Assad to cease the use of these weapons," Tillerson told ABC's "This Week." "Other than that, there is no change to our military posture."
Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., the former Democratic Vice Presidential nominee and a member of both the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, believes these strikes were unlawful because they say they were not included in a formal approval of force from Congress.
"We don't have a system where the president just gets to launch missiles against anybody they want to," Kaine said on Sunday's "Meet The Press." "They haven't presented a plan to Congress and asked for our approval. That's what they've got to do."
Kaine has been one of the Senate's most vocal advocates for a new AUMF (Authorization for the Use of Military Force) for military action in the Middle East, and they made very similar claims about military action under the Obama Administration. On the Foreign Relations Committee, Kaine voted to authorize force against Assad in Syria in 2013 after chemical weapons were used.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on "Meet The Press," also pushed for the president to ask Congress for authority for these kinds of strikes, but repeatedly said they wanted them to happen with more international involvement.
"We've got to work with countries around the world for a political solution to get rid of this guy and to finally bring peace and stability to this country, which has been so decimated," Sanders said. "I do not believe, to answer your question, that the president simply has the authority to launch missiles. I think they have got to come to the United States Congress."
Graham, who argues for more American troops involved, believes the president “already has that authority.”
"I think the president has authorization to use force," Graham said. "Assad signed the chemical weapons treaty ban. There's an agreement with them not to use chemical weapons. What have we learned? That war criminals don't police each other very well. We have Putin's regime – a bunch of war criminals – and we expected them to police Assad? That didn't work out very well. So all these resolutions are limitations on using force."
"We are on sound legal footing here but our strategy has not yet developed," they added.
Kaine also said they don't want the policy to be the United States telling Syria, "we're going to change the regime of your leadership."
"That's for Syrians to decide," they said.
"I agree with Ambassador Haley that I don't think there's any political solution to the civil war in Syria that doesn't mean that Assad moves aside because he's tearing up the country. But instead of regime change, what we should focus on is humanitarian relief."

Dozens of parents kept their children home from school Wednesday over concerns about a fifth grader who was suspended for drafting a student "kill list." Jonathan Gonzalez reports live for NBC4 News at 11 a.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 18, 2017. (Published Wednesday, Jan. 18, 2017)
A fifth grader who was initially suspended for drafting a "kill list" made up of classmates names will not return to their elementary school for the remainder of the school year, the district said Wednesday.
After parents in Riverside County found out about the list, many expressed concerns for students' safety and dozens of parents kept their children home from school Wednesday.
Lake Mathews Elementary Principal Pamela Williams wrote a letter to parents Monday saying school officials first learned of the list last Thursday and contacted law enforcement. They say officials investigated and concluded no one at the school was in danger.
"These types of behaviors are ALWAYS taken seriously by RUSD and therefore we immediately began an investigation, convened our site threat assessment team and notified law enforcement," Williams wrote in the statement. "As a result of this comprehensive process, it was determined that there was, and is, no danger to any of Lake Mathews' students."
Parents Concerned Over Student 'Kill List' at School
Parents were concerned for students' safety Tuesday after a fifth grader was suspended who wrote a student "kill list." Some parents believed the child should be expelled. Jonathan Gonzalez reports live for NBC4 News at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 17, 2017. (Published Tuesday, Jan. 17, 2017)
The Riverside County Sheriff's Office spoke with the child, the child's parents and school officials and determined the child did not have means or access to guns or "weapons of that nature," said Sgt. Chris Durham of the Riverside County Sheriff's Department.
"We believe that the school is safe, and there's a lot that goes into saying that a school is safe," said Justin Grayson of the Riverside Unified School District. "We wouldn't want to, we would never say that a school is safe when we felt that it wasn't."
The school has about 900 students.
The Riverside Unified School District confirmed to NBC4 the child's suspension would end Wednesday, but could not confirm when the child would return to school.
Some parents said suspending the boy from school for two days was insufficient and wanted them expelled. They sent a petition signed by 86 parents to the district's superintendent saying they won't send their children to school if the boy returns.
"I think that child shouldn't go to that school anymore, maybe be put in, I don't know, some other kind of school that … can take care of somebody," said parent Melanie Reck.
Parents Worried Over Student 'Kill List'
Some parents were worried Tuesday about sending their children to a Riverside elementary school after a fifth grader was suspended over a student "kill list" last week. Jonathan Gonzalez reports live for Today in LA on Tuesday, Jan. 17, 2017. (Published Tuesday, Jan. 17, 2017)
Other parents were upset they found out about the incident on social media, because a letter was not sent from the school until Monday.
"I think the learning experience from this is to get information out sooner to parents to avoid all the hysteria," said Jennifer Stinnett, a parent of a kindergartner and a first grader at the school.
District officials tried to ease parents' worries at a school board meeting Tuesday night. Many parents attended the meeting to voice their concerns about a lack of information from the district, but most were concerned about whether or not the boy would return to the elementary school.
Lake Mathews Elementary school officials told NBC4 Tuesday the child had not been expelled and could come back to school, but noted the district was working with the child's parents to explore other schooling options. The school district said they have procedures in place to monitor the child, and will be giving the child extra attention and care moving forward.
The district says they are barred from talking about the student due to confidentiality laws, but Grayson released the following statement to NBC4 Wednesday morning.
"Right now district officials are at huddled at Lake Mathews Elementary working to determine the course of action for continuing student in question's education," Grayson wrote Wednesday. "Alternative educational opportunities are being discussed, but no final determination had been made yet."
Several parents told NBC4 that school officials said the child was not in school Wednesday morning.
Later on Wednesday, the Riverside Unified School District released a statement and noted they take a "safe schools guarantee" in the California Constitution "very seriously."
"For that reason, the District's Child Welfare and Attendance Department has determined that the student recently accused of threatening communications will not be returning to Lake Mathews Elementary School for the remainder of the 2016-17 school year," read the statement from the district.
The statement did not mention the child's future schooling plans, or whether or not the child would attend another school in the district.

2016 Election: Republicans seem to like nothing more than kicking one of their own when he's down. So it's not entirely surprising that dozens of Republicans decided that now is the time to declare Donald Trump unfit for office. But in doing so, they've made themselves, not Trump, look like idiots.
One reason for the rise of Trump is, arguably, the anger at the fact that so many establishment Republicans refuse to attack Democrats with the same vigor as they attack their own. Now that Trump's poll numbers are slipping and their campaign is in disarray, they are at it once again.
First came a blistering letter signed by 50 officials who've served in various national security capacities in past GOP administrations. "None of us," they said, "will vote for Donald Trump."
They say Trump "lacks character, values and experience," has "little understanding of America's vital national interests" and "lacks the temperament to be president."
Fair enough. We haven't been shy in our criticism of Trump, particularly on foreign policy matters, either.
But many of the examples these erstwhile Republicans provide to back up their decision apply as much to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as to Trump.
The authors complain that "despite their lack of knowledge," Trump "claims that they understand foreign affairs." Yet it was greenhorn Obama who once bragged that "I know more about policies on any particular issue than my policy directors."
These Republicans say Trump "appears to lack basic knowledge about and belief in the U.S. Constitution ... religious tolerance, freedom of the press." But they ignore the fact that Obama, with Hillary's full knowledge and consent, has spent almost eight years running roughshod over the Constitution, attacking religious freedom and intimidating the press.
They say Trump "persistently compliments our adversaries and threatens our allies." We could devote thousands of words providing examples of Obama committing this sin.
So where were these high-minded Republicans when Obama was running for president and seeking re-election? Where was their blistering attack as Obama's policies led to the decline of U.S. influence abroad, the rise of ISIS, an increasingly aggressive Russia and China, and a soon-to-be nuclear-armed Iran? Their silence was deafening.
And how is it that all these national security experts can bring themselves to say about Hillary Clinton is that they "have doubts" about her?
Trump has serious character flaws, to be sure, but Clinton has an actual record of failure in just about everything they did as secretary of state. And that's to say nothing of the cavalier disregard for national security with their use of an unsecured private email server while at State. Even the head of Obama's FBI admitted that Clinton's recklessness likely put classified information in the hands of our enemies.
If there's anyone who, on national security grounds, is unquestionably disqualified for the highest office, it is Clinton, not Trump. Yet these spineless Republicans are either too afraid or too politically correct to say so.
Next came a statement by Republicans who once headed the EPA and complain that Trump isn't sufficiency liberal when it comes to the environment.
Trump "hasn't a clue about Republicans' historic contributions to science-driven environmental policy," write William Ruckelshaus and William Reilly, who ran the EPA during the Nixon and George H.W. Bush administrations, respectively.
"We Republicans should be shocked, outraged even, at the prospect that all this progress, this legacy will be repudiated and rolled back by Donald Trump."
This is, to put it charitably, sheer lunacy.
The EPA is the most out-of-control, unaccountable, scientifically unmoored and economically hazardous agency in the federal government. Under Obama, the courts have repeatedly blocked the EPA's lawless power grabs. The latest is its alleged climate-change-fighting "clean power" rule, which the courts put on ice after two dozen states sued to stop it. Republicans should be uniform in calling for this agency to be reined in, not showering it with praise.
Constructive criticism of any candidate is important. But there's a difference between constructive criticism and the tawdry political opportunism on display this week by Republicans who ought to know better.
As the doughnut-shaped main building of Apple Campus 2 enters its final year of construction, contractors are starting to talk.
What's got them buzzing is not so much the scale of the building—a $5 billion glass-and-steel ring roughly the size of the Pentagon—but the exacting construction standards they are being asked to meet.
On a site that jettisoned its lead contractor last month, the building's “fit and finish” has become a source of friction.
“There were many meetings when the Apple representative would pick up your [iPhone] and say: ‘That's what we're building.” one contractor that has worked on the project told Business Insider. “What that means is—if you look at the phone, there's the sheen on the phone, there's the bevel on the phone, there's how much shine they have … every piece of that phone is engineered, and the building is the same way.”
BI's source says Apple is “raising the bar” for U.S. construction standards. In a Techpinions essay Friday Tim Bajarin speculates that construction is another industry Apple could end up disrupting.
“Disrupt” isn't the right word here, says New York architect David Mayner. “If they want to build a crazy vanity project and pay through the nose for it, it's not going to change what anybody else does.”
Buildings have long been constructed to varying standards, depending on local building codes and the client's willingness to pay. European standards tend to be higher than North American. Apple's may be higher still.
Reporting two years ago on what was to be Steve Jobs' final project, Businessweek's Peter Burrows drilled down into the specs:
“Rather than cement floors, Jobs wanted to use a stone-infused alternative such as terrazzo, buffed to a sheen normally reserved for museums and high-end residences. Jobs insisted that the tiny gaps where walls and other surfaces come together be no more than 1/32 of an inch across, vs. the typical ⅛ inch in most U.S. construction. Rather than a lightweight, sound-absorbing acoustical tile, Jobs even wanted the ceilings to be polished concrete. Contractors would typically erect molds with crude scaffolds to pour the cement in place, but that leaves unsightly ruts where the scaffolding puts extra pressure on the surfaces. According to two people who've seen the plans, Apple will instead cast the ceilings in molds on the floor and lift them into place, a far more expensive approach that left one person involved in the project speechless.”
In the latest flyovers you can see that the finishing touches aren't far away. The earth has been removed. The underground garage is mostly finished. The custom-made curved glass windows—shipped from Germany—are coming soon.
They better fit.

"Why does Trump hate grandmothers?"
So asked Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) on Sunday as they decried a proposal from the administration that would prevent abused or mistreated seniors in nursing homes from getting their day in court, jeopardizing their health and safety.
"Everyone should be outraged that the Administration is proposing to strip legal rights from fragile seniors and their families during the incredibly stressful time when a loved one is entering a nursing home." —Lauren Saunders, National Consumer Law Center
Lieu's concern and outrage over the effort is shared with fellow lawmakers as well as patient and consumer advocacy groups like Public Citizen, who said the effort to roll back protections from some of society's most vulnerable people is just part of "a disturbing trend of the Trump administration attempting to reverse critical protections against forced arbitration," which prevents individuals or groups of people from filing lawsuits or seeking damages for fraud, abuse, neglect, medical malpractice and other forms of wrongdoing.
As Jason P. Steed, an appellate lawyer, kindly translated on Twitter: "Translation: Trump Admin making it easier for nursing homes to abuse elderly and not be held accountable for it."
With Monday the last day for the public to weigh in on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) proposal to ditch an Obama-era rule prohibiting use of forced arbitration "ripoff clauses" in nursing home admission agreements, lawmakers and advocacy groups are trying to draw attention to the effort and also filing official objections to the rule with the agency.
"Almost everyone will admit a loved one into a nursing home or long-term care facility," said Remington A. Gregg, counsel for civil justice and consumer rights in Public Citizen's Congress Watch division, who authored the group's objections. "This life-changing and often heart-breaking experience is made even worse when being forced to sign away your right to go to court if you are the victim of neglect or abuse. CMS should be doing all that it can to protect and honor our seniors rather than eliminating critical protections for their well-being."
Meanwhile, in a letter sent Monday to Seema Verma, the controversial head of CMS appointed by Trump, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was joined by 30 Democratic senators in denouncing the deregulatory effort.

"Forced arbitration clauses in nursing home agreements stack the deck against residents and their families who face a wide range of potential harms, including physical abuse and neglect, sexual assault, and even wrongful death at the hands of those working in and managing long-term care facilities," the letter (pdf) states. "These clauses prevent many of our country's most vulnerable individuals from seeking justice in a court of law, and instead funnel all types of legal claims, no matter how egregious, into a privatized dispute resolution system that is often biased toward the nursing home. As a result, victims and their families are frequently denied any accountability for clear instances of wrongdoing."
In its letter to the CMS, the Fair Arbitration Now Coalition, which also opposes the effort by Trump, said the "proposed rule is a disturbing new direction for CMS, which should be protecting patients, not making it easier for facilities to harm them and cover it up."
According to Gregg, the protections imposed under Obama were finalized "after examining years of evidence and studies showing increasing abuse and neglect at nursing homes and the need for more accountability."
Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, said "Everyone should be outraged that the Administration is proposing to strip legal rights from fragile seniors and their families during the incredibly stressful time when a loved one is entering a nursing home."
While Esquire political columnist Charles P. Peirce gave Trump themselves a bit of a pass by placing the blame for the move squarely at the feet of right-wing ideological "cruelty," there were those highlighting the possible conflict of interest of the president:
