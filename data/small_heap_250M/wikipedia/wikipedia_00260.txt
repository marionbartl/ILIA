Alice Miriam Pinch (October 17, 1887 – July 22, 1922) was an American born soprano who sang two seasons with the Metropolitan Opera Company of New York. Her career was cut short by her untimely death due to complications from appendicitis.
Prior to her engagement with the Metropolitan Opera, she accompanied Enrico Caruso on what proved to be his last tour of North America. Ms. Pinch went by the stage name Alice Miriam.
Early life
Alice Miriam Pinch was born in Newton, Kansas on October 17, 1887. Her father, Rev. Pearse Pinch, was a Wesleyan Methodist Minister. Her mother, Mary Pinch, née McCasey, was born in New York City. Alice was the fifth of seven children. Her father immigrated from England at an early age. The family moved frequently during her childhood, remaining in the country's heartland until finally settling in Glendale, Maryland outside of Washington, D.C..
The young Pinch sang regularly in her church choir, singing solos by the age of eight. By age twelve she was earning extra money for her family by singing at funerals and other community and private events.
While living outside of the city of Chicago, she and her sister were engaged to perform at the Battle Creek Sanitarium. Pinch's performance caught the attention of a woman in the audience who provided her with a letter of introduction to the Chicago socialite Emily Hutchinson Crane, the widow of the industrialist Richard T. Crane. Thus Pinch became Crane's protégé, and it was arranged to send her to Europe for voice training. Crane covered all of Pinch's expenses for the next five years.
The European Years
Pinch arrived in Paris in 1911 where she began her training for the opera, studying with Jean de Reszke. She remained in Paris until 1914.
While In Paris, she met the young German sculptor Arnold Rönnebeck, who was also there to study, and at the same time, establish himself within its modernist milieu. Rönnebeck's regular invitation to Gertrude Stein's Saturday dinner parties are a testament to his success in this regard. The couple's social circle included Rönnebeck's cousin, Karl von Freyburg, and the American painters Marsden Hartley and Charles Demuth. Pinch and Rönnebeck became engaged to marry during this period.
The onset of war meant Rönnebeck's return to Germany to enter military service. It was at this time that Pinch sought a new voice teacher, and relocated to Milan, Italy to train with Georges Cunelli. This change was a fortuitous one for both pupil and teacher. Cunelli was just setting out on what proved to be a storied career of fifty plus years. In his memoir he devotes a chapter to his work with Pinch, entitled My First Success.
Pinch began performing professionally across Europe before returning to the United States in 1919.
Return Home
Pinch sailed out of Genoa for New York City on September 4th, 1919. One year later, on September 28th, she embarked on an eleven city tour of North America accompanying Enrico Caruso.
Upon her return from the tour, Pinch began her first season with the Metropolitan Opera Company of New York. During her second season she received glowing notices when she was called on to fill in for the lead role in Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's The Snow Maiden (Snegurochka) when the principle performer Luctezia Bori fell ill the night before the performance.
In addition to her Opera dates, Pinch performed frequent recitals at private "soirées", as well as concert halls in and around the New York City area. Among the more notable was her appearance at The Town Hall when she and Allen Tanner premiered the entire song cycle Słopiewnie Op. 46 bis, composed by the Modernist Polish composer Karol Szymanowski on January 20 and 21, 1922.
Pinch's last performance with the Metropolitan Opera was at Municipal Auditorium (Atlanta) on April 29, 1922, when she performed the part of Siebel in Wagner's Faust.. Her contract had been renewed for three more years.
Death
Alice Miriam Pinch died at The Flower Hospital in New York City on July 22, 1922, after having undergone surgery for an appendicitis the week before. Funeral services were held in Glendale, Maryland on the 25th of July.
Arnold Rönnebeck, after recovering from wounds suffered during the war, immigrated to the United States in 1923, and stayed with the Pinch family upon his arrival. Marsden Hartley dedicated his first published volume of poetry, Twenty-Five Poems "To Alice Miriam Pinch". Other appreciations of her work include the essay by Paul Rosenfeld, music critic for The Dial, published there in November 1922, and anthologized in his collection of essays, Musical Chronicle.

A La Mar is the second studio album by Dominican musician Vicente García, released on August 26, 2016.
Background and accolades
The album marks García's first collaboration with Calle 13 producer Visitante. The collaboration inspired García to deviate from mainstream bachata and incorporate a variety of genres into the album: the artist recalled, "I [didn't] want to be that guy that just does Caribbean music". García won three awards including Best New Artist at the 2017 Latin Grammy Awards. The song "Bachata en Kingston" from A La Mar won Best Tropical Song at the ceremony. A La Mar was ranked by the Los Angeles Times as the best album of the decade by any Dominican artist.

Nicolas François Vuillaume (1802–1876) was an important French luthier of the Vuillaume family, and younger brother of the illustrious Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume. He ran the leading workshop in Brussels, Belgium, and was appointed instrument maker to the Royal Conservatory in Brussels. His instruments won a number of medals at exhibitions.
Biography
Nicholas François Vuillaume (NFV) was born in Mirecourt, Vosges, in 1802, the fourth of five sons to Claude-François Vuillaume. The Vuillaume family had been luthiers in Mirecourt for several generations. Millant traces a family tree, identifying "for sure" a great-great-grandfather Claude-Francois Vuillaume (born about 1700). There is a legendary ancestor, one Jean Vuillaume, who was supposedly a pupil of Stradivari, but this remains a legend, and perhaps was invented as a joke. Most of the Vuillaume family were destined to become instrument makers, the most famous being NFV's elder brother, the second son Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume (JBV) who became perhaps France's pre-eminent maker and dealer in stringed instruments.
From the start, J.B. Vuillaume was the boldest, most audacious and most business-like of the family, moving to Paris at the age of 19, where he worked first in the workshops of François Chanot and Lete, and joining them in partnership before finally setting up his own. NFV, like his other siblings, joined his brother business in Paris, and initially made instruments that were labeled J B Vuillaume. While in Paris NFV quickly gained a fine reputation for producing outstanding instruments.
With an elder brother of the stature of J.B. Vuillaume, N.F. Vuillaume took perhaps the only course of action open to him in seeking to establish himself as a maker and dealer in his own right – he moved to set up his own establishment in Brussels, Belgium. (Millant gives this date as 1820, but 1830 seems more likely given the limited number of his named instruments dating from this period.) Though he owned his own shop, NFV continued to make instruments for JBV, and as JBV's business grew rapidly, NFV was his first choice for work. Examples attributed to NFV as late as 1857 imply that he continued to supply instruments to JBV in addition to those made in his brother's substantial workshop. This convenient arrangement may explain that it took until the year 1833 for NFV to label the 41st instrument in his own name.
Over the next few years N.F. Vuillaume sold instruments in his own name at a rate of around 10 a year. Away from the shadow of his brother, NFV flourished and by 1836 had been appointed instrument maker to the Royal Conservatory of Music in Brussels. NFV won a clutch of medals at various exhibitions, including the Medal de Vermeil in 1841 and the Medal First Class at the Universal Exposition in Paris in 1855. In 1873 he was appointed Chevalier to the Order of Leopold. In terms of violin making, Belgium and the Vuillaume family is part of the French School, and for a time the two Vuillaume brothers were the pre-eminent figures in France and Belgium.
Over his working life, N.F. Vuillaume produced in excess of 340 instruments bearing his label, and an unknown number under his brother's label. Millant notes that in 1823, JBV started the unusual practice of numbering his instruments - and that Gand and Bernadel adopted the same practice, as did NFV. NFV's instruments are typically branded or signed on the underside of the table with instrument number and date and labeled. In his earlier years he appears to have favoured instruments in the style of Giovanni Paolo Maggini, while later on he moved more towards Stradivari models.
Initially he may have operated largely on his own, but as his workshop became established he employed a number of craftsmen who were top makers in their own right including three members of the Darche family—Charles Francois, Hilaire and Nicholas (who subsequently set up own shop in Aachen)—as well as Jean Baptiste Collin-Mezin (prior to setting up his own establishment in Paris in 1867).
N.F. Vuillaume operated as a dealer as well as maker and, though never approaching his brother's legendary cache of Cremonese instruments, records on Cozio indicate that the Stradivari cello "General Kyd" (1684) was bought by N.F. Vuillaume in 1857, and that the Matteo Grofriller cello "ex-Muller" (1710) and the "Cessole" Stradivari violin of 1715 also passed through his hands. The Hill brothers tell that after the death of J.B. Vuillaume in 1875, "Le Messie" (the Messiah) Stradivari violin was offered to NFV for the price of 12,000 francs, but the offer was refused.
Before his death in 1876, N.F. Vuillaume's business and title as "Luthier du Conservatorie Royal de Musique Bruxelles" had been taken on by Georges Mougenot. For a number of years afterwards, at least as late as 1885, instruments bearing NFV labels were still produced from his workshop.
A double bass by Georges Mougenot labeled from 1875, the year he took over the shop of NFV in Brussels, reads as the "Royal Maker of Liege". This double bass is a Vuillaume model but with a Mougenot label from Liege.

John Derrick Mordaunt Snagge (8 May 190425 March 1996) was a British newsreader and commentator on BBC Radio.
Life
Born in Chelsea, London, he was educated at Winchester College and Pembroke College, Oxford, where he obtained a degree in law. He then joined the BBC, taking up the position of assistant director at Stoke-on-Trent's new relay station 6ST. He broadcast his first sports commentary (of a Hull City versus Stoke City football match) in January 1927, after the BBC obtained the rights to cover major sporting events.
In 1928, Snagge was transferred to London to work as one of the BBC's main announcers alongside Stuart Hibberd. From 1931 until 1980, he commentated on the annual Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race. He provided commentary for the coronation of King George VI in 1937 and again in 1953 for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.
At the start of the Second World War, Snagge was made the BBC's presentation director and delivered important radio announcements as the war unfolded. By the time of the D-Day landings in 1944, he was presenting the magazine programme War Report which featured regular news from the beaches of Normandy. He announced that Allied Armies have started landing "on the northern coast of France" at 9.32 am on 6 June, but without giving the actual location (Normandy).
In the early 1950s, Snagge played a role in negotiations that led to the radio comedy series The Goon Show being commissioned by the BBC. He was also the subject of many running gags during the show, and provided many self-parodying announcements, usually recorded. He also featured as himself in the episode The Greenslade Story, alongside regular announcer Wallace Greenslade. He was a defender of the show against many efforts to cancel it, even to staking his career on it. Later, in the 1970s, he echoed his wartime role by appearing as the newsreader in the radio version of Dad's Army, setting the scene at the beginning of each episode.
He appeared as himself in the 1960 TV Hancock's Half Hour episode, 'The East Cheam Centenary', where he commentates on the street 'procession', from Hancock's bedroom at 23 Railway Cuttings.
Snagge retired in 1965, but continued to provide commentaries for the Boat Race until 1980. The same year his wife Eileen died. Around this time he also appeared on Noel Edmonds's Radio 1 show on Sunday mornings, a role subsequently taken up by Brian Perkins.
When BBC Radio Stoke-on-Trent (now BBC Radio Stoke) was launched in 1968 Snagge introduced the new station by apologising for the break in transmission that had occurred on 30 October 1928, i.e. the close of 6ST, and that it was " due to circumstances beyond our control. Normal transmission has now been resumed".
He voiced the commentary on the Sex Pistols track, Pistols Propaganda, which appeared on the B-side of their single (I'm Not Your) Stepping Stone. The track is the soundtrack to the trailer for their film, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle.
During the 1949 University Boat Race Snagge's voice filled with excitement and he reported: "I can't see who's in the lead but it's either Oxford or Cambridge".
He was the guardian of Wally Hope, founder of the Stonehenge Free Festival, until his premature death in 1975.
John Snagge died in Slough from throat cancer in 1996, aged 91.
Family
Snagge was the son of Sir Thomas Mordaunt Snagge (1868–1955), also known as Judge Mordaunt Snagge, knighted in 1931, and Gwendaline Rose Emily Colomb (1876–1966).
His paternal grandfather was Sir Thomas William Snagge, KCMG (1837–1914). His mother's father was the British naval strategist, Sir John Colomb, KCMG (1838–1909).
He was married twice: firstly, in 1936, to Eileen Mary Joscelyne (the daughter of Harry Percy Joscelyne). She died in 1980. He married, secondly, Joan Wilson in 1982. She predeceased him in 1992.

Karma Phuntsok (; born 1952 in Lhasa, Tibet) is a Tibetan painter.
He fled Tibet with his family after the uprising against the Chinese in 1959, escaping into India as refugees. He studied drawing and painting through his school years in India. In 1973 Karma studied thanka painting with a master of traditional Tibetan thanka painting in Nepal. Since then he has been making paintings based on Tibetan Buddhist deities.
In 1981 Karma migrated to Australia, and now lives in the bush north of Kyogle with his wife and son.
Karma's paintings are collected worldwide, and published in various books and magazines. His recent paintings are mostly experiments, interweaving traditional techniques and symbols, with modern inspirations.

Edward "Lumpy" Stevens (1735 – 7 September 1819) was an English professional cricketer who played first-class cricket in the 18th century. He was an outstanding bowler who is generally regarded as the first great bowler in the game's history. He was universally known by his nickname and was always called "Lumpy" in contemporary scorecards and reports.
Cricket career
Stevens was born in 1735 at Send, Surrey.
The beginning of Stevens' career, in 1756, was before scorecards began to be kept on a regular basis. It is not known if Stevens was the first to "give the ball air", but he was certainly around when that particular revolution occurred, probably before 1770. What is known is that Stevens was the bowler who made the most careful study of flight and worked out all the implications of variations in pace, length and direction mentioned above. He became a master of his craft.
Stevens is normally associated with Surrey teams. He continued as a player until he was 54, playing his last match in 1789 for England against Hampshire at Sevenoaks Vine.
It is not known what took place in his career following this game, but John Major suspected that Stevens enlisted in the British Army: on 20 May 1793 a letter signed by 'A Kentish Cricketer' written to Sporting Magazine describes an incident where an Ensign Hamilton, a member of the Sevenoaks Vine Club, had a cannonball deflected away from his head by a Sergeant. The magazine and the Maidstone Journal both linked the story to Stevens.
Style and technique
How he came by his legendary nickname is uncertain but it may have been because he was adept at choosing a pitch to suit his very subtle variations of pace, length and direction. In the 18th century, choice of pitch was granted to one team according to agreement and it was generally the leading bowler on that team who chose the place where the wickets would be pitched. According to the famous verse:
Family and personal life
Stevens was a gardener by trade and his bowling prowess earned him a job on the Walton-on-Thames estate of the Earl of Tankerville, a noted patron of the game.
Legacy
It is known that in a single wicket match in May 1775, Stevens beat the Hambledon batsman John Small three times with the ball going through the two stump wicket of the day. Partly as a result, a third stump was agreed.

The theory of the least objectionable program (LOP) is a mediological theory explaining television audience behavior. It was developed in the 1960s by then executive of audience measurement at NBC, Paul L. Klein,
who was greatly influenced by the media theorist Marshall McLuhan's Understanding Media.
"Why You Watch What You Watch When You Watch"
In an article "Why You Watch What You Watch When You Watch" (published in TV Guide in 1971), Klein explained that viewers consume the medium of television rather than television shows, treating the medium as the end of their consumption itself rather than using the set as a means to access specific programs they like the way they might choose a book from a shelf to access the story within. Since the introduction of television, the same percentage of sets are in use on, say, a Thursday evening at a certain hour, year after year, regardless of what content is broadcast. This is because unlike the way people use books, museums, or the cinema as means of consuming desired content, audiences consume television, the medium, as the desired object. TV viewers turn the set on, deciding to "watch television", and then seek out something to watch from what is available, flipping around, not until they find "something they like" - because television programming is in fact very rarely satisfying, and viewers rarely watch anything they actually like - but until they find something that doesn't offend them enough to make them flip to the next channel. (Viewers almost never turn off the set as a result of finding nothing tolerable and judging every program available boring or otherwise objectionable. Viewers commonly watch programs they describe later than unbearable, everything else on being even more intolerable. A more common response to a whole spectrum of equally unendurable choices than choosing to abandon the medium is to continue to flip frequently until new choices become available.) Thus, for programmers of television channels, Klein recommended understanding that audience attraction was a matter not of pleasing the greatest number of viewers but of offending the fewest (driving the fewest away to the competitors who may repulse them less). The television audience is in a kind of partial trance. A network will do better worrying less about not giving an audience enough to like, to be surprised and delighted by, and to engage their attention, than about avoiding, as Klein said, "disturbing their reverie" with something that causes them to change the channel. Thus, even as channel choices proliferate alongside numerous easily accessed out-of-schedule viewing options, successful television programs remain, as they have always been, formulaic, cliché, "instantly familiar," predictable, and monotonous in tone.
Least offensive programming
Least offensive programming (sometimes abbreviated as LOP) was a strategy employed mainly by major US television networks, approximately from the 1940s to late 1970s, where viewer numbers were thought to be sustained by television programming that offended the fewest viewers. The result was an often mass-produced, bland output of popular culture focused on leisure, targeting the American middle class. The theory was popularized by Klein.

Obsolescence of the theory
It has been widely suggested that the theory itself is obsolete thanks to high quality shows, top-rated options and viewers' choice of shows whether live or time-shifted alongside the advancements of DVDs and Netflix.

Gare () is a quarter in central Luxembourg City, in southern Luxembourg. The quarter has, since 1859, been the location of Luxembourg's principal railway station and terminus, Luxembourg station, around which it subsequently developed. The quarter's name translates into English, from the French Gare, to "station".
Geographically, the quarter is situated on the Bourbon plateau, and is separated from the Ville Haute quarter, heart of Luxembourg's ancient fortifications, by a steep valley where the Pétrusse joins the Alzette river in the Grund quarter. The valley was first spanned by the Passerelle viaduct, opened in 1859.
Following the 1867 Treaty of London, which ordered the dismantling of Luxembourg's fortifications, the quarter expanded rapidly, notably with the construction of the Adolphe Bridge, opened in 1903, and connected to the station by the grand Avenue de la Liberté.
, the quarter has a population of 11,040 inhabitants.

Berosus is a lunar impact crater that is located in the northeast part of the Moon, less than one crater diameter northwest of Hahn. Further to the east-northeast is the large crater Gauss, and to the north-northwest lies Bernoulli. Because of its location, this crater appears foreshortened when viewed from the Earth.
The rim of this crater is roughly circular, but with some angularity along the eastern edge. The southern end of the crater has been heavily eroded, and there are some tiny craterlets along the northern rim. The inner walls have some terracing along the east and northwestern sides. The interior floor of Berosus has been flooded by lava, and so is level and nearly featureless.
Satellite craters
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Berosus.

Bennard Yao Kumordzi (born 21 March 1985) is a Ghanaian former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He mostly played for Panionios and more recently Genk and Kortijk.
Club career
Early career in Ghana and Sweden
Kumordzi started his career playing street football at Klagon FC Youth before signing for lower-league side Supreme FC. After playing three league matches in the 3rd Division he trialled with a number of clubs in Europe, finally joining a Swedish amateur club called FC Norrköping. During a cup match in July 2005 between FCN amateurs and IK Sleipner, a Second Division club, Kumordzi performed magnificently to win the match for his amateur club. Stefan Hellberg, the then-coach of Swedish Superettan side IFK Norrköping, who was at the game, told journalists that he had just discovered a gem. He gave him a trial with his club and Kumordzi jumped six tiers in the football league pyramid from the sixth Division amateurs to the Superettan. However, he never became a regular starter in the team. His stay there was ended after Kumordzi going on a strike on contractual disputes with his former club FC Norrköping.
Greece
During the strike he had gone to Greece to practice with Greek Super League side Egaleo FC. He signed a five-year contract with the Greek outfit.
In January 2007, the Hellenic Football Federation awarded Kumordzi the Most Valuable Player award for the first half of the 2006–07 Super League Greece season.
Among clubs scouting Kumordzi was German Bundesliga side Bayer 04 Leverkusen.
His excellent performances were the reason that he gained a transfer to a bigger team. He signed a contract with Panionios on 23 May 2007.
France and Dijon
His performances in the Greek Super League earned Kumordzi a move to Ligue 1 club Dijon FCO in January 2012 .
International career
On 20 January 2007, Kumordzi was called up by Ghana's Olympic Team known as the Black Meteors for the 2008 Olympic Games Qualifier against Burkina Faso Olympic Team. He also played the two-legged tie of the 2007 All-African Games qualifying match against Nigeria U-23, which Ghana won.
On his 22nd Birthday, Kumordzi received his first senior call up for Ghana, as a direct injury replacement for Ghana captain Stephen Appiah for Ghana's FIFA International friendlies against Austria and Brazil on 24 and 27 March 2007. His international debut was against Brazil on 27 March 2007 at the Råsunda Stadium, Stockholm, Sweden when Ghana lost 1–0.
He scored his first goal for Ghana against Iran at the Azadi Stadium in Tehran on Thursday 28 June 2007.
Style of play
In 2005, Swedish newspaper Folkbladet compared Kumordzi to Nigeria international Nwankwo Kanu. Kumordzi stateed he admired Patrick Vieira who played for Arsenal.

Capelo is a freguesia ("civil parish") in the municipality of Horta on the island of Faial in the Azorean archipelago. The population in 2011 was 486, in an area of 26.64 km². Capelo may be considered the westernmost settlement of Eurasia, if Fajã Grande, on Flores Island, is considered part of North America, for it sits on the North American Plate.
History
The village was elevated to civil parish in 1600, when it was de-annexed from the neighbouring parish of Praia do Norte. Friar Diogo das Chagas, in 1643, noted that the parish had about 160 inhabitants, and approximately 44 residences. At its largest, the population reached 1,400 inhabitants.
The town was practically destroyed in 1672 and 1673 during the volcanic eruption of Cabeço de Fogo (the name of the central volcano on the island of Faial). During this eruption, volcanic ash and pyroclastic projectiles rained down on the community, destroying homes and sterilizing agricultural lands in Capelo and Praia do Norte. Ironically, between 1673 and 1845, Praia do Norte was integrated into the civil parish of Capelo.
The Church of the Santissima Trinidade (Church of the Holy Trinity) in Capelo, was ordered constructed by the Captain-major, Jorge Goulart Pimental, to replace the parochial church, the Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Esperança (Our Lady of Hope), which was destroyed during the 1672 volcanic eruption. A chapel to Nossa Senhora da Esperança was later constructed near the old church (which has since disappeared from the landscape).
The chapel of Varadouro was founded in 1720, by Father Manuel Pereira Cardoso, to the invocation of Nossa Senhora do Carmo (Our Lady of Mount Carmel). Later, in his 1725 last testament, Father Cardoso requested that his inheritors celebrate a mass in perpetuity to the name Nossa Senhora do Carmo, the Holy Sacrament, and Santo António, on every first Sunday of October. The spa at Varadouro was constructed and inaugurated on 1 August 1954 by architect Read Teixeira.
Geography
Physical geography
Mountainous volcanic craters cover the majority of the parish (being the location of the most recent volcanic eruption in the Azores). The parish has several facets: an area of volcanic craters that extends from the islands caldera, inland pasturelands used to support the agricultural/dairy industry, and a coastal zone of cottages and oceanfront pools. Linking these areas is the ubiquitous Regional Road E.R. 1-1ª that connects the communities on the island with Horta in the southeast corner.
The parish is located on layers of volcanic materials referred to as the Capelo Volcanic Complex. It is a line of volcanic escoria cones of fissural nature lying on a west-northwest-east-southeast orientation consisting of basaltic volcanism of low explosivity. The peninsula shows varying volcanic shapes and products resulting from surtseyan, Hawaiian and strombolian phases of volcanism. It is area of young rock (less than 10.000 years), overlying the older pyroclasts of the Caldeira Formation, and includes two historical eruptions (the 1672 Cabeço do Fogo and 1957 Capelinhos eruptions). This fractural zone is defined by the Capelo Fault, a fracture system of cones and craters displaying right lateral echelon geometry, which extends to Capelinhos volcano in the western tip of Faial. In this particular area, Capelo Fault is expressed by tens of sub-vertical fractures, concentrated in a 250 meter wide zone, cutting through the pyroclastic sequence of a surtseyan cone exposed in a paleo-sea cliff east of Capelinhos volcano. An example of these fractures can be found on the surface of the Capelinhos volcano; a warm vent on its eastern flank belies the active nature of this volcanism.
Ecoregions/Protected areas
The parish is crossed by several pedestrian hiking trails connecting the volcanic cones along the Capelo Volcanic Complex: Cabeço do Fogo, Cabeço Verde and Cabeço do Canto, as well as interesting geological sites such as Fonte dos Namorados. Capelo is also known for its micro-climate, which has allowed the cultivation of grapes and small wine production. The areas along Canada das Adegas (in Norte Pequeno) and Varadouro are characteristic of these private holdings and "adegas".
In addition, two major protected areas fall within the frontiers of the parish:
Área Protegida para a Gestão de Habitats ou Espécies dos Capelinhos, Costa Noroeste e Varadouro () - the protected area encompasses many of the extinct cones of Cabeço Verde, Cabeço da Fonte, Caldeirão, Cabeço do Canto and Caldeirinhas along the Capelo cape until Cabeço do Goularte, flanking of the central caldera. The protected area, designated for the protection of habitats and species includes pre-existing environments and the nascent ecosystems of the volcanic structures of Capelo, as well as the fragile ecoregion created by the Capelinhos eruption;
Área Protegida de Gestão de Recursos dos Capelinhos, includes primarily the impact area of the Capelinhos eruption that extends from the Estrada Regional E.R.1-1ª to the Costa do Nau coast and Capelinhos volcano. This area, primarily identifiable by the barren moonscape and iconic lighthouse were designated for protection and management, and conserves the post-eruption landscape, interdicting reconstruction of homes lost during the event. In addition to the Costa do Nau, the protected area extends to the coast and ocean territory off the coast, surround the base of the volcano;
Área Protegida para a Gestão de Habitats ou Espécies Varadouro–Castelo Branco () - this protected area includes the escarpment face of the southern coast, extending from Varadouro to the Morro de Castelo Branco, which are nesting grounds for migratory and marine bird species;
Further, and also included in the Capelinhos-Nordoeste-Varadouro region is the Parque Florestal do Capelo (), a region that extends from the central Capelos cape to the coast between Biscoitos and Varadouro used as leisure/recreative forest park.
The Geographer Christophe Neff working since 1999 on environmental changes and vegetation dynamics and plant distribution in the different landscapes of the Capelo area, wrote recently in his blog, - that Capelo has considerably changed in the last twenty years, - more tourism, more secondary houses, and more vineyards are now part of the landscape of Capelo. In the same text he remarked, that in 1999 Capelo was a very fare remote area, the End of the world, “Fim do Mundo”, the same name as a bar, that was situated, in Norte Pequeno in the North of Capelo.
Climate
Capelo has a humid subtropical climate at low altitudes and a wetter oceanic climate at higher altitudes.
Human geography
In addition to the village of Capelo, at the intersection of the E.R.1-1ª and E.R.3-2ª, the parish includes the localities of Areeiro, Biscoitos, Canto, Cimo da Ribeira, Cruzeiro, Norte Pequeno, Ribeira do Cabo, Rua do Canto, Rua da Igreja and Varadouro.
Economy
The economy in this region is primarily agriculture-related, with dairy-oriented activities dominating. Meanwhile, owing to the numerous natural monuments in the region (the aforementioned Capelinhos volcano and protected areas), the region regularly sees eco-tourist activities throughout the year, with rural tourism, pedestrian trails and other leisure activities occurring in the areas of Capelo and Varadouro.
The parish's southern coast is considered the "spa region" of the island, dominated by a large bay and the black rock cliffs of Varadouro and the Mouro volcanic plug. Discovered in 1889, the warm waters at Varadouro were considered, at the time, one of the best medicinal treatments in the country for rheumatism and skin diseases; its hypersaline waters whose temperatures average , attracted "beachgoers" who travelled to the ocean-carved pools for refreshment during the Gilded Age, while partaking of the thermal waters at the spa.
Since this period, the use of the thermal waters has been intermittent, during phases of proactive local governments; around the late 20th century the buildings were already in ruins. Plans to economically rejuvenate the area were concentrated on reconstructing the buildings, as a way to attract new visitors. But, in November 2007, these small plans were suspended in order to redevelop the site into a Hotel-Spa facility. These plans stagnated until 2009 when, along with INOVA, the regional government proposed a new project to revitalize the thermal-spa potentiality of the Azores (called TERMAZ), which projected the reconstruction of the existing Varadouro spa buildings: a project that was stalled by 2011. Amid opposition declarations requesting a timeline for their reconstruction, by 2011, the Regional Government indicated their intention to expropriate lands necessary to "re-qualify and reactivate" the Thermae of Varadouro (and suggesting that only 10% had not been acquired until this point).

In addition to the festivals associated with the Holy Spirit (which occur several weeks following Easter), the parish is the center of the Festas do Varadouro. This religious celebration is associated with the testamente of Father Cardoso who requested his heirs celebrate a mass in his Chapel of Varadouro in the name of Nossa Senhora do Carmo (Our Lady of Carmo). The celebration occurs on the first Sunday in October.
Tourism
Tourism in this parish is associated primarily with the main sites: Capelinhos and Varadouro. The re-qualification of the primary roadways within the past few years has been a process of improving and developing rural, eco- and geo-tourism. Similarly, with the emphasis on improving tourism in the Varadouro region, the natural rock pools have been improved and thermal spa in planning for remodeling.

Sambrook is a small village in the ceremonial county of Shropshire, where it is part of the civil parish of Chetwynd, north of the town of Newport. To the north is the small hamlet of Ellerton, with Howle to the west and Pickstock to the south-east.
It was recorded as a manor in the Domesday book survey, when it was known as "Semembre"; the spellings "Sambroc" and "Sambrock" were later used: the name probably means "sand brook".
In the village there is an early 18th-century manor house, Sambrook Manor, a public house, the Three Horseshoes, and a mill with a large millpond fed by the Goldstone and Waggs Brooks. The 19th-century village church, St Luke's, was designed by Benjamin Ferrey.
There is another mill, the derelict but Grade II Listed 18th-century Showell Mill, a short distance to the south-east.

Ngāti Rangi is a Māori iwi (tribe) of New Zealand. Contemporary settlement is mainly around Waiouru, Ohakune, and the Upper Whanganui River in the central North Island. The iwi's area of interest extends north from the Paretetaitonga peak of Mount Ruapehu, west to the Pukupuku Stream, east to the meeting of the Moawhango and Aorangi waterways, and south to the Haumakariri Stream. Ngāti Rangi trace their ancestry to Paerangi. They believe they were in New Zealand before the first migrations from Hawaiki.

The Telegram Building is a historic building in Portland, Oregon. It was constructed in 1922, several years after The Evening Telegram newspaper had been purchased by John E. and L. R. Wheeler. The Telegram was a newspaper founded in 1877 by Henry L. Pittock; it merged in 1931 with the Portland News, creating the Portland News-Telegram, which ceased publishing in 1939.
The red brick and terra-cotta structure culminates in a colonial-style clock tower.
A major renovation was completed in 2004, renovating the building to accommodate multi-tenant office space. The renovation added two floors of underground parking, office space upstairs, and a penthouse (also office space) behind the clock tower. The Telegram Building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.

In radio reception, radio noise is unwanted random radio frequency electrical signals, fluctuating voltages, always present in a radio receiver in addition to the desired radio signal. Radio noise near in frequency to the radio signal being received (in the receiver's passband) interferes with it in the receiver's circuits. Radio noise is a combination of natural electromagnetic atmospheric noise ("spherics", static) created by electrical processes in the atmosphere like lightning, manmade radio frequency interference (RFI) from other electrical devices picked up by the receiver's antenna, and thermal noise present in the receiver input circuits, caused by the random thermal motion of molecules.
The level of noise determines the maximum sensitivity and reception range of a radio receiver; if no noise were picked up with radio signals, even weak transmissions could be received at virtually any distance by making a radio receiver that was sensitive enough. With noise present, if a radio source is so weak and far away that the radio signal in the receiver has a lower amplitude than the average noise, the noise will drown out the signal. The level of noise in a communications circuit is measured by the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), the ratio of the average amplitude of the signal voltage to the average amplitude of the noise voltage. When this ratio is below one (0 dB) the noise is greater than the signal, requiring special processing to recover the information.
The limiting noise source in a receiver depends on the frequency range in use. At frequencies below about 40 MHz, particularly in the mediumwave and longwave bands and below, atmospheric noise and nearby radio frequency interference from electrical switches, motors, vehicle ignition circuits, computers, and other man-made sources tends to be above the thermal noise floor in the receiver's circuits.
These noises are often referred to as static. Conversely, at very high frequency and ultra high frequency and above, these sources are often lower, and thermal noise is usually the limiting factor. In the most sensitive receivers at these frequencies, radio telescopes and satellite communication antennas, thermal noise is reduced by cooling the RF front end of the receiver to cryogenic temperatures. Cosmic background noise is experienced at frequencies above about 15 MHz when highly directional antennas are pointed toward the sun or to certain other regions of the sky such as the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.
Electromagnetic noise can interfere with electronic equipment in general, causing malfunction, and in recent years standards have been laid down for the levels of electromagnetic radiation that electronic equipment is permitted to radiate. These standards are aimed at ensuring what is referred to as electromagnetic compatibility (EMC).

Gianni di Marco is a fictional character from the BBC serial drama EastEnders, played by Marc Bannerman from 1998 to 2000.
Throughout his time on the show, the character mostly contributed to his family's story arc since their first arrival on 26 January 1998. This involves Gianni developing a close interaction with his older brother Beppe (Michael Greco); managing their late father's restaurant in light of his funeral; becoming enemies with Beppe's sworn nemesis Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp); briefly dating local businesswoman Annie Palmer (Nadia Sawalha); a broken relationship with fellow resident Jackie Owen (Race Davies) after she leaves the square with her criminal brother Steve (Martin Kemp); sparking clashes with Grant's brother Phil (Steve McFadden) and his best-friend Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass); and nearly being charged in police custody for attacking his sister's maths tutor, Rod Morris (Forbes Masson), under the guise that he assaulted them.
Eventually, Gianni departed the programme along with the majority of his family on 3 August 2000.
Storylines
Gianni Di Marco first arrived in Albert Square - the local community in Walford, a fictionalized borough in East London - along with the rest of his family in January 1998. He is the younger of the two brothers in the family, the other being Beppe (Michael Greco). They have two younger sisters, Teresa (Leila Birch) and Nicky (Carly Hillman). Gianni works as a chef in the family restaurant, Giuseppe's, named after his late father. He later becomes the manager of the restaurant.
During his time on the square, Gianni sparks relationships that all end in disaster. This begins with him dating local businesswoman Annie Palmer (Nadia Sawalha), which is stopped when there are doubts over whether Gianni's real father is actually Annie's father George (Paul Moriarty). DNA tests prove Gianni really is a di Marco, but his relationship with Annie doesn't continue. He then has a relationship with fellow resident Jackie Owen (Race Davies), but discovers that she suffers from severe PMT, and this makes their relationship more and more difficult when Gianni has to put up with Jackie's violent temper and foul moods. Eventually, Jackie leaves Walford with her criminal brother Steve (Martin Kemp) and her relationship with Gianni is over. Gianni later began a brief affair with one of his neighbors, Louise Raymond (Carol Harrison), but it isn't anything more than a casual fling.
By then, Gianni has found himself drawn in an ongoing feud between Beppe and his sworn enemy Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp. This continues when Grant's brother Phil (Steve McFadden) gets involved in the conflict, whereupon the two groups of brothers appear to have a rivalry over several interests. At one point in The Queen Victoria public house, Gianni grows irritated when he finds Teresa romancing with Phil's best-friend Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) - not long after he was revealed to have cheated on his girlfriend Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) with her daughter Bianca (Patsy Palmer); the mother-and-duo consequently left the square on their own alongside Bianca's beloved husband Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen). When Gianni confronts Dan to warn him in staying away from Teresa over threatening circumstances, Dan rebuffs him until Gianni throws a drink at him. The pair nearly brawl until Gianni is forced to leave the pub.
Later on, Gianni attacks Nicky's maths teacher Rod Morris (Forbes Masson) after she claims that he assaulted her. Rod presses charges of assault but later drops them. Gianni and the rest of his family leave Walford in August 2000 to start a new life in Leicester, living with their uncle Franco - leaving Beppe and his son Joe (Jake Kyprianou) in Walford.
Character creation and development
The Italian di Marco family were introduced early in 1998 by Series Producer Jane Harris. The di Marcos were a family of eight, consisting of grandparents Bruno and Luisa (Leon Lissek and Stella Tanner), their daughter-in-law Rosa (Louise Jameson), her children Beppe, Gianni, Teresa and Nicky, and Beppe's young son Joe. They were heralded as the "family that would rival the Mitchells", one of the most successful and long-running families to have been featured in EastEnders.
According to author Rupert Smith, the di Marcos "landed with an almighty thud in January [1998], turning out in force for the funeral of patriarch Giuseppe", who was Rosa's husband and an old business associate of the character George Palmer.<ref name="20years">{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Rupert|title= EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square |year=2005|publisher=BBC books|isbn=978-0-563-52165-5|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> The following month, the family moved to the area in which the soap is set, Walford, to run an Italian restaurant, which was named Giuseppe's.
The di Marcos remained with the show as a unit until 2000, when the new executive producer, John Yorke, decided to cull the majority of the family. All except Beppe and his son Joe were written out. They were reportedly "slaughtered because of a shortage of ideas for what to do with them". A source allegedly told The Mirror: "It's always unpleasant having to say goodbye to people who have given loyal service to the show for a number of years. But John Yorke feels it's time to make his mark on the show. Every new producer likes to do the same. John wants to introduce a new family later this year and felt the Di Marcos had nowhere else to go. Their storylines were beginning to feel tired and that's a good time to make such a drastic change."
However an official BBC spokesperson at the time commented: "These changes […] are just part of [John Yorke's] plans to revamp the series and give it a new look." The cuts paved the way for the arrival of the popular Slater family. Beppe and Joe remained until 2002, when they were axed too.
Reception
The di Marcos are now deemed as something of a failure for EastEnders. Since their departure, the family has even been mocked in an EastEnders official book, entitled EastEnders 20 Years In Albert Square. In the book, the author, Rupert Smith, writes :"Nobody really knew what to do with the di Marco family, who had been languishing in the pizza restaurant without a decent storyline between them. Finally, there was nothing else for it: the di Marcos would have to go. All of them…it was as if they'd never been".
Matthew Baylis of The Guardian'' has commented on their lack of success: "Thank heaven for off-screen uncles. As we saw during the hurried departure of the di Marco family from Albert Square, there's nothing like a fictitious relative when you need to get characters off the screen…The di Marcos' departure had its dodgy elements. A hitherto unheard-of uncle needs help in his restaurant, so the whole family ups sticks. Including Teresa - who'd always fought for independence from her family? Rosa, who presumably owned the house she'd transformed into something resembling an Imperial Palace, is suddenly prepared to leg it with a couple of suitcases? There was plenty that didn't ring true. But few viewers minded. There was, if anything, more sympathy for the programme-makers, trying valiantly to dispose of this singularly unpopular family while retaining an element of drama."
The di Marcos have been dismissed as "unconvincing characters". Baylis goes on to highlight a problem that he feels "dogged the whole family", their occupation as restaurateurs. Baylis believes this kept them "self-contained", and prevented them from establishing meaningful links with other characters. He explains: "[The di Marcos] had an ambiguity, heightened by the job they did. Soapland has no place for grey areas. Bad things happen to bad people. They also happen to good people, of course, but not for very long. To make this predictable universe work on the screen, you need characters who are relatively stable (even if they are unstable). The writers and the viewers buy into a myth that people aren't particularly complex, that the full range of their feelings and actions can be revealed in a few hours on the TV. And a quick, visible way of revealing characters is to mirror them in their occupation. Thus we have Pauline Fowler, long-suffering drudge and matriarch. What better job than folding pants all day in the launderette? Or Peggy [Mitchell] - tough but fun-loving and gregarious. So she runs the pub. But what attributes spring to mind when we think of Italian restaurants? Fond of pasta, perhaps? Permanently overworked? The job never provided an easy route into understanding the di Marcos' characters…The most visible jobs tend to be taken by the strongest, most vivid characters. Confined to their restaurant, the di Marcos could only become involved in Walford life when other characters came over to eat a carbonara. And how often do working-class East End people do that? If any di Marco wanted a night out, a pint in the Vic, a clandestine liaison, then an excuse had to be found as to why they weren't working. Transforming Giuseppe's into a daytime sandwich bar, and sending Teresa onto the market were bold rescue attempts, but they came too late. The viewers had already decided they didn't much care…Because of their jobs, the di Marcos became a largely self-contained unit…"

Juan Catalino Domínguez (May 4, 1910 – April 18, 1948) was an Argentine serial killer who, in-between several prison escapes from 1944 to 1948, killed eight people before being gunned down by police in a gunfight.
Background
Juan Catalino Domínguez was born in the small town of Rauch on May 4, 1910. Little is known of his early life, but by 1933, he began to commit thefts in the rural areas of Ayacucho and Coronel Vidal. From 1940 to 1943, he was incarcerated for an altercation that occurred in Mar del Plata, where he had worked as a chauffeur.
By 1944, Catalino worked as caretaker of a luxiourous residence in La Loma de Stella Maris neighborhood of Mar del Plata, living there with his 18-year-old wife Isabel (née Criado) and their little daughter, Marta. In spite of their financial situation, he allowed a friend of his, Rafael Luchetti, to live together with them. One day, however, he found his wife having sex with their guest. Upon this discovery, Luchetti drew a revolver on Catalino, who in turn tried to defend himself by punching him, only to be shot in the leg. While he was writhing in pain, Luchetti took Isabel and Marta in a car and drove off. The badly wounded Catalino was soon found and taken to a nearby hospital, where he spent some time recovering from his wounds.
First murders
After his release from hospital, Catalino was hellbent on capturing and killing Luchetti, going so far as to stalk his mother's house in Dolores, assuming that at one point he would come and visit her. There, he lived in a small shed on the outskirts of the city and made a living by doing odd jobs for a man named Jaime Casanova, while frequenting the home of two neighbors - widow Gregoria Rosas and her common-law husband, Narciso Peñalba.
One night, Catalino came across the couple and fiercely demanded that they tell him where Luchetti was, thinking that his wife and daughter were still with him. When neither of them gave a satisfactory answer, the enraged man pulled out a knife and started viciously stabbing and kicking both of them. Still dazed by his own rage, Catalino dragged the corpses to a nearby haystack, where he hid them and promptly left.
Capture and escapes
Once the murders were discovered, police diligently searched for the perpetrator until they found Catalino hiding in a hotel in Mendoza. Offering no resistance, he was quickly arrested by two guards and scheduled for transportation to La Plata. While passing through the town of Pergamino, Catalino feigned sickness and was allowed to get out the car and take off his handcuffs to relieve himself. After he went into the cornfield by the roadside, Catalino took off his coat and left it hanging on some plants in view of the guards, who patiently waited for his return.
On April 20, 1945, Catalino was located in Mar del Plata, on a farm on 1526 Rodríguez Peña Street, as he had learned that his daughter was living in the city. He was surprised by police - who had been waiting for him for months - and opened fire on them with his gun, but was hit in the left leg by commissioner García. Catalino attempted to flee, but fractured his femur in the process, and was recaptured. He was again sent to the hospital and kept under surveillance, but one night, he asked the guard to remove the handcuffs so he could go the bathroom. Once again, he managed to escape by climbing out of the bathroom window to the roof and then jumped out into the garden. From there, he went into the streets, where he stole a bicycle and sped away into the stormy night, in spite of having a gangrenous infection on his wound.
Azul murders
While police searched for him in Rio Negro and the Neuquén Province, Catalino returned to Dolores, where Luchetti, Isabel and Marta were currently residing. As he was about to take his revenge, Luchetti and Isabel fled, leaving Marta behind. Pursued by the local and federal police, Catalino and his daughter travelled frequently around the countryside to work odd jobs, with him using various aliases to lay low.
Eventually, he found himself in a rural area of Azul, and using the alias Donato Aguirre, he left his daughter at the owners' boarding house, exclaiming that he was unable to take care of her by himself. On June 28, 1947, Catalino was found loitering in a field near a ranch in Cuartel IX by a ranch hand named Braulio Leguizamón, whom he proceeded to shoot three times. After climbing up a hill with the man's body in tow, Catalino hid it among a pile of bags and old rags. In the meantime, alerted by the landlords, the police located and questioned his daughter, quickly establishing her true identity. As a result, she was immediately taken away and placed in an orphanage, the Hogar del Buen Pastor.
On July 8, Catalino, who had found employment as a ranch hand in Chillar, learned that his true identity had been discovered by his employer Guillermo Alberti. Shortly after, he went to the kitchen where, without saying a word, he shot to death both Alberti and another ranch hand, Victoriano Serrano. After he hid Alberti's body under some metal sheets, Catalino tied Serrano's body to a horse and traveled to a pit, where he then dumped it.
Sheltered by the darkness of the icy roads in a small cabin, he prowled around town at night searching for his daughter. However, while loitering around the Instituto de Varones, Catalino was spotted by a police commissioner, causing to immediately ride out of town. For the next several days, he wandered in the vicinity, but the strict surveillance prevented him going back in. As a result, Catalino was forced to leave Azul for good.
Final murders
Now calling himself Pedro Montenegro or Aguirre, Catalino committed a series of robberies and thefts in Tandil, Rauch, Dolores, El Tordillo, General Juan Madariaga and the surrounding area, before returning to Mar del Plata and settling in the La Juanita neighborhood. He then moved to Colonia Barragán, near Estación Cobo, where he stayed with his neighbor Bienvenido Basualdo, a farmer and renowned cow herder.
On March 7, 1948, in the rural area of El Trio, on the northern environs of General Pueyrredón Partido, Catalino found himself on the farm of the Mehatz family, for whom he had worked previously as a gardener. Taking advantage of their absence due to it being election day, he and a 17-year-old accomplice named Orlando Nelson Rosas (or Alberto Gómez), an escapee from a juvenile detention facility, decided to rob the place.
Unexpectedly, the Mehatzes returned to the farm because some of them had forgotten their voting papers. The first to enter the house was Martín (a senior employee in Mar del Plata's Casino Central), whom Catalino shot three times. His sons, 22-year-old Martín Mayo and 19-year-old Marcelo, tried to flee, but the former was shot in the back, causing him to fall on the ground, before Catalino unloaded the rest of his revolver's chamber into him. With no bullets left, Catalino took out a knife and slit Marcelo's throat, but as he was taking too long to die, Rosas gave him a mace with which he crushed his head.
The pair then loaded the bodies into the family car and traveled to General Juan Madariaga, dumping the bodies on the field of farmer Ángel Casales. They then tried to hide the car by "burying" it in the forest, but they simply covered it with firewood and branches, then left.
Exposure and death
After the murders, Catalino went to work in La Eudocia, taking on farm work for Juan Carlos Pétersen. However, while reading the news about the Mehatz family murders one morning, Mrs. Pétersen realized that the farm hand was indeed Catalino and informed police. Before they could arrest him, however, he had already fled.
In early April 1948, commissioner Pedro Cavanva received a complaint from a man named Pedro Jaureguiberry, saying that he had been robbed by a man who was riding "a sulky with red wheels". Determined to catch the criminal, Cavanva, together with Corporal José M. Diuberti and watchman Raymundo Manrique, went to the La Espadaña field of General Juan Madariaga in the early morning hours of April 18.
There, they questioned the man in charge of the post, Enrique Merlo, who claimed that there was nobody else in his house. However, the commissioner noticed that a sulky with the characteristics described by Jaureguiberry was parked at the back of the farm, prompting him and his men to start searching the property. Suddenly, an unknown man appeared, took cover, pulled out a revolver and opened fired on them. Almost immediately, the officers fired at him with their Winchesters, hitting him with four fatal shots and killing him instantly. The man was then quickly identified as Juan Catalino Domínguez, who was apparently sleeping on the farm before being startled by the officers' arrival.
Not long after his death, Rosas was caught in a nearby ranch and imprisoned for his participation in the crimes. He continued committing crimes until he himself was killed sometime during the 1960s. Catalino's daughter, Marta, was transferred to La Plata and later to an institute in Ingeniero Maschwitz, where she remained until adulthood.

Born in Aylmer, Lower Canada, the son of Charles Devlin and Ellen Roney, his father was a merchant from Roscommon in Ireland. After attending the Petit Séminaire de Montréal from 1871 to 1877, he studied at the Université Laval in the faculty of arts from 1879 to 1881 but did not graduate. It is uncertain what his profession was before being elected as the Liberal candidate in 1891 to the House of Commons of Canada for the riding of Ottawa (County of) with the help of his friend Henri Bourassa. He was re-elected in 1896 for the riding of Wright. He resigned in 1897 and was appointed Canada's first trade commissioner in Ireland and served until 1902.
In 1902, against the advice of Canadian Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, Devlin was elected by acclamation to the British House of Commons as the Irish Parliamentary Party candidate for Galway Borough.

Seema Mustafa (born 20 April 1955) is an Indian print and television journalist. She is currently the Editor-in-Chief of The Citizen, a digital newspaper she founded. She is the elected president of the Editors Guild of India, since 16 October 2020.
Background and education
Seema Mustafa was born in Delhi to a muslim family from Uttar Pradesh. Her father, Syed Mustafa, was an officer in the Indian Army. Her mother was the daughter of Shafi Ahmed Kidwai, brother of Rafi Ahmed Kidwai, a freedom fighter and Congress politician. Shafi Ahmed Kidwai, who lived in Mussoorie, was killed in 1947, at the time of the partition of India. His wife Anis Kidwai (Seema's maternal grandmother) was later made a Rajya Sabha MP belonging to the Congress party.
Mustafa has two elder brothers, S.P. Mustafa (known as "Bobby"), group treasurer of Hindustan Unilever, and Kamal Mustafa, now retired but formerly the Head of Global M&A of Citibank. Ayesha Kidwai, a professor of linguistics at JNU and a feminist activist, is her first cousin. Seema's mother and Ayesha's father were siblings.
Mustafa graduated with a BA in political science from Lucknow University in Uttar Pradesh.
Career
Mustafa began her career in journalism with The Pioneer (a Lucknow-based newspaper), moved to The Patriot in 1979, and worked for several other Indian publications, including The Telegraph and Indian Express before joining the Asian Age in 1997 as its political editor and Delhi bureau chief.
While with the Asian Age, Mustafa received the prestigious "Prem Bhatia Award for Excellence in Political Reporting and Analysis" in 1999 for her coverage of the Kargil war. She also wrote a weekly op-ed column which was syndicated to several other newspapers, including The Deccan Chronicle of Bangalore and The Dawn, a Pakistani newspaper. In 2008, she wrote an op-ed that was uncharacteristically critical of the Congress party. The article denounced the Indo-US Nuclear Deal specifically and the congress-led government in general for seeking friendly relations with the George W. Bush administration.. Although the intemperance of her views and language elicited criticism in the Indian media, MJ Akbar, founding editor of the Asian Age, defended Mustafa strongly and the newspaper propagated the same views as hers on its pages. Ultimately, M.J. Akbar and Mustafa were both sacked from the Asian Age.
After leaving the Asian Age in 2008, Mustafa worked as Resident Editor of Covert, a fortnightly left-wing political magazine. In January 2010, her mentor M.J. Akbar launched The Sunday Guardian, a weekly newspaper, and Mustafa joined him as Resident Editor. By September the same year, the publication was on its last legs and was acquired by the ITV Group, which runs the India-TV and NewsX television news channels. After the sale, Akbar moved to the India Today group, while Mustafa moved to NewsX, hosting a weekly interview programme named Straight Talk With Seema Mustafa on that channel. She served as National Affairs Editor of News X. The program did not get enough TRPs (viewership), and Mustafa moved on again.
She next took over the job of Director of a new, left-wing think-tank based in New Delhi named the "Centre for Policy Analysis" (not to be confused with the eminent Delhi-based think-tank, the Centre for Policy Research), a position she presently holds. Concurrently, in January 2014, she founded The Citizen, an independent "Digital Daily" based out of New Delhi.
Mustafa is the president of the Editors Guild of India, elected on 16 October 2020.
Writing style
Mustafa has been noted for having a characteristic leftist and socialist perspective.
Political career
Mustafa has been associated with several communist and socialist political parties since the 1980s. She wrote the authorised biography of former prime minister VP Singh, entitled The Lonely Prophet, and was closely associated with him during his lifetime. She was a member of his party, the Janata Dal, for many years. She once contested the UP provincial assembly elections as a Janata Dal candidate but lost.
Mustafa also contested parliamentary elections to the Lok Sabha two times (1991 and 1996) from the Domariaganj constituency in Uttar Pradesh, but lost badly and even forfeited her election deposit on both occasions. In the 1991 elections, she took the 4th position in 1991 and in 1996, the 10th position. In 1991, she contested as a candidate of the Indian Congress (Socialist) - Sarat Chandra Sinha, an obscure splinter of the Indian National Congress (Socialist), itself a splinter of the Congress party. In 1996, she contested as an independent candidate.
In 2012–13, Mustafa associated herself with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM) in its campaign to pressure the government of India to oppose the US and support Iran on the issue of Iran's right to develop nuclear weapons. Mustafa is part of the CPM's Committee to Campaign for an Independent Foreign Policy. She has of course written extensively in opposition to the Indo-US Nuclear Agreement.

Jensen's skate (Amblyraja jenseni), also known as the shortail skate, is a poorly known species of fish discovered in 2004 during a study of bottom ichthyofauna aboard the Norwegian RV G.O. Sars, where four species were identified, including A. jensieni.
Etymology
The skate is named in honor of Danish zoologist Adolf Severin Jensen (1866–1953), of Lund University, for his contributions to the ichthyology of the North Atlantic Ocean.
Taxonomy
The shortail skate is a member of the family Rajidae, of which 30 genera and over 180 species are recognized. Amblyrija is the genus name of which 10 species are recognized, including A. doellojuradoi (southern thorny skate), A. frerichsi (thickbody skate), A. robertsi (bigmouth skate), etc.
Description
Members of the family Rajidae carry uncharacteristically similar body plans. This makes visual identification of these individuals extremely difficult. Detailed visual descriptions of A. jenseni are hard to attain, so the description below may represent several of the family Rajidae and should not necessarily be used to differentiate them.
A. jenseni is a medium-sized skate. Its maximum known length is 74.3 cm (29.3 in) for males and 85 cm (33 in) for females. Its coloration is chocolate-brown to gray-brown above with scattered darker spots. Ventral on the body appears a patchy white and brown mixture, except for the pelvic fin lobes and tail, which are darker. These white patches are on the snout, upper abdomen, nostrils, mouth gill slits, and anal opening. Its underside is smooth and its dorsal surface is densely covered with prickly scales. Two or three pairs of distinctive scapular thorns are on each shoulder, usually arranged in a triangle, and a row of 24-29 median thorns occur along the back, flanked by a row of smaller lateral thorns on the tail. The tail of the shorttail skate is relatively short.
Sexual dimorphism in shorttail skates is present in pelvic fin structure that the males modify to act as copulatory claspers, as well as alternate disc lengths, horizontal diameter of the orbit, height of the tail at the pelvic fin tips, length of the third gill slit, and distances from the center of the anus to the first and second dorsal fins.
Distribution and habitat
This species of skate is believed to only be found in the North Atlantic, off the coasts of New England, Nova Scotia, Grand Banks of Newfoundland, Iceland, Ireland, Canada, and along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at depths of 167 to 2,548 m (548 to 8,360 ft), making it one of the deepest-occurring skates known.
Biology and ecology
Skates represent a critical consumer of invertebrates and small fish, representing a similar role as apex predators of the ecosystem. Little is documented about their feeding behavior, but like other of its family, it presumably would eat various cephalopods, crustaceans, and small bony fish such as rattails and teleost fishers.
A. jenseni is presumed to be oviparous like other skates. but no observed reproduction cycles have been reported.

Alexei Prokopievich Berest (, , (Oleksiy Prokopovych Berest); March 9, 1921 – November 4, 1970) was a Soviet political officer and one of the three Red Army soldiers who hoisted the Victory Banner.
Biography
Early life
Born to an impoverished Ukrainian family, seven of Berest's fifteen siblings died prematurely. He was orphaned when eleven years old, and raised by his older sisters. From the age of sixteen, he worked as a tractor driver. Berest volunteered into the Red Army in October 1939 and took part in the Soviet-Finnish War as a signaller. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union, he was sent to the front once more. In March 1943, while stationed in the Volkhov Front, Corporal Berest joined the Communist Party. In December, he was sent to the Leningrad Military-Political School (Which at the time was located at Shuya, after being evacuated) and trained as a commissar. After graduation in September 1944, Lieutenant Berest was assigned as Captain Stepan Neustroev's deputy for political affairs (Zampolit) in the 1st Battalion of the 150th Rifle Division's 756th Regiment.
Battle of Berlin
On 30 April 1945, after long days of street combat in Berlin, the 150th Division attacked the Reichstag. On 1 May, at about 03:00, Berest and two scouts - Meliton Kantaria and Mikhail Yegorov - hoisted one of nine Soviet flags given to the division's commanders on the building's dome, fastening it to Wilhelm I's statue. Although not the first to be placed, the flag was eventually proclaimed as the Victory Banner. Later, posing as a Colonel, he negotiated with the German garrison of the Reichstag on the terms of their surrender. He received the Order of the Red Banner for his actions.
Post-war years
In May 1945, Neustroev, Kantaria and many others who were involved in the Reichstag assault were awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. For unknown reasons, Berest did not attain the award and his part in the operation was silenced. In 1948, he was discharged from the army and began working in the regional cinema department of Rostov-on-Don. In 1953, he was convicted of embezzlement and sent to ten years in prison, of which he served five. After being released, he was employed in the local Rostselmash factory as a common laborer. On 3 November 1970, Berest was run over by a train as he saved a child who strayed on the railway. He died of his injuries in the early hours of the following day.
He was posthumously granted the title Hero of Ukraine on 6 May 2005.

The Federal Poets is a poetry group based in Washington, D.C. It is the oldest continually operating poetry group in the metro Washington D.C. area. The group aims to assist members with improving their poetry through critiques by other members, and to increase the exposure of members through readings and publication. The Federal Poets meet every third Saturday at Tenley Public Library. The group's journal, The Federal Poet, is published semiannually and consists of submissions of the best works by members.
History
The Federal Poets was founded in 1944 under the name the Commerce Literary Society, at the Commerce Department. The name was soon changed to the Bookfellows Club. In 1946, the club changed its name for the final time, renaming itself as the Federal Poets. Originally, the Federal Poets only accepted people working for the federal government as members, however the group eventually extended membership to include anyone who wrote poetry. The group's members include people such as Walter Howard Kerr, who served as its treasurer, vice-president, and president. Kerr's poetry has been included in several publications, such as the Southern Poetry Review and the Red Clay Reader. Kerr was a member of other poetry societies such as the Maryland State Poetry Society, of which he was treasurer. Other members of the Federal Poets include Ingeborg Carsten-Miller who edited The Federal Poet and was the author of works such as Northern Lights (Nordlichter).

Asemoneinae is a subfamily of jumping spiders (family Salticidae). It was created in 2015 by Wayne Maddison. Most species are found in Africa or Asia. The subfamily initially had five genera, but Hindumanes was later transferred to the subfamily Lyssomaninae.
Description
Members of the subfamily Asemoneinae are translucent and long-legged relative to most other salticids. They resemble members of the subfamilies Onomastinae and Lyssomaninae sensu Madison, 2015. The posterior median eyes are unusually central for salticids, being distinctly closer to the midline than is the inner edge of the anterior lateral eyes.
Taxonomy
In 2015, Wayne Maddison divided the subfamily Lyssomaninae, as circumscribed in 1980 by Wanless, into three subfamilies, Onomastinae, Asemoneinae and Lyssomaninae s.s. Maddison included five genera. Molecular data united the three sampled genera, Asemonea, Goleba and Pandisus. Two genera, Hindumanes and Macopaeus, were included based on previous classifications. In 2017, Hindumanes, whose type species was originally placed in Lyssomanes, was moved to Lyssomaninae s.s., on the basis of the similarity of the male palpal bulb.
Genera
, four genera were placed in the subfamily:
Asemonea O. P.-Cambridge, 1869
Goleba Wanless, 1980
Macopaeus Simon, 1900
Pandisus Simon, 1900

Joshua Frederick Cockey Talbott (July 29, 1843 – October 5, 1918) was a U.S. Congressman who represented the second Congressional district of Maryland.
Biography
He was born near Lutherville, Maryland on July 29, 1843. He began to study law in 1862 but joined the Confederate Army during the American Civil War in 1864 to serve in the Second Maryland Cavalry. Following the war, Talbott was admitted to the bar in 1866 and began to practice law in Towson, Maryland.
In 1878, after several years of activity in Democratic politics and local civic affairs, he was elected to the U.S. Congress. Except for the periods 1885 to 1893, during which he served for a time as Insurance Commissioner for Maryland, and 1894 to 1902, he served in Congress until his death. Talbott was a member of the House Naval Affairs Committee for 25 years and worked unceasingly for a strong and modern Navy.
He died in Lutherville on October 5, 1918, and is interred in Sherwood Cemetery of Cockeysville, Maryland.
Namesake
The destroyer was named for him.

The 1982 Flores earthquake struck the island of Flores in Indonesia on December 25. Registering a moment magnitude of 5.9, according to the International Seismological Centre, it created landslides and was reportedly accompanied by a tsunami. The earthquake killed thirteen people and left 390 injured, also destroying 1,875 houses and 121 other buildings. The villages of Layahong and Oyong Barang were damaged by seven seconds of shaking.
Tectonic setting
The Lesser Sunda Islands lie in a region with frequent seismicity, and there is a history of tsunamis in the area. Both the subduction of the Australian Plate and the crust in the Flores Sea could be responsible for this activity.
Impact
The five most affected districts were evacuated of 6,000 people. The local and regional governments were petitioned for supplies like tents, medicine, and food. The earthquake was followed by several aftershocks.

The Zucchini Warriors is a young adult novel by Gordon Korman.
Plot
Over the summer, Macdonald Hall has built an impressive football stadium on the north lawn, financed by an alumnus, zucchini magnate Henry 'Hank the Tank' Carson. Bruno and Boots are dismayed by this discovery, as they had been expecting a rec hall to be built with the money. A promise of a rec hall being built at the end of the football season by Carson soon has them on board. The team (the Macdonald Hall Zucchini Warriors) does poorly until Cathy Burton from neighboring school Miss Scrimmages slips into the team as quarterback. A ruse is concocted in which Elmer Drimsdale pretends to be quarterbacked, since the two are alike in height and build.
Drimsdale is also attempting to get four endangered Manchurian bush hamsters to reproduce. The four are voracious eaters. The students use them to help dispose of the many free zucchini sticks, in order not to hurt the feelings of Carson. Eventually they are released accidentally and take up residence in the stadium under the bleachers, eating the zucchini sticks tossed under the seats during games. The spices in the batter causes them to reproduce wildly, resulting in the population zooming to over 400.
Meanwhile, inspector Kevin Klapper, an ex-football addict, has come for a random inspection. He disapproves of the game and writes a scathing report. He too succumbs to the lure of the game and stalls, ignoring his job to help coach the team.
Eventually the team is set to win the Daw Cup. However, Kevin's boss, Mr, Greer, arrives to find out why he has missed work. He finds a scene of carnage in the guest cottage (result of a nosebleed by Sydney) and a draft of Kevin's original report. He concludes that Mr. Sturgeon has murdered him to prevent the report from being sent and contacts the police. Also Kevin's wife has discovered what he has really been doing with his time, and drives to the Hall to confront him. Both parties arrive at the same time, after the team has won and been presented with the cup. The sirens panic the hamsters and they swarm out from under the stands. Elmer hears them and rushes out onto the field. Cathy and he is seen at the same time and the game is up, literally. The trophy is confiscated by an official because of the Warriors having an "ineligible player". The other team wins by default.
The police arrive and Bruno is afraid that the police are there to arrest Mr. Sturgeon for this and confesses to the switch. On finding Kevin alive, Greer is first pleased and then angry, as is Kevin's wife. Carson, however, stands up to them and reveals that he has arranged for a coaching position for Kevin.
Mr. Sturgeon is somewhat angry with the team for the whole debacle, but accepts that a good deal was due to Cathy Burton's efforts. As punishment, he required the team to clean up the stadium, including the extensive hamster nest under the bleachers. Elmer is exempt, as per an agreement with Bruno he signed earlier, in exchange for participation in the quarterback switch.

Biostimulation involves the modification of the environment to stimulate existing bacteria capable of bioremediation. This can be done by addition of various forms of rate limiting nutrients and electron acceptors, such as phosphorus, nitrogen, oxygen, or carbon (e.g. in the form of molasses). Alternatively, remediation of halogenated contaminants in anaerobic environments may be stimulated by adding electron donors (organic substrates), thus allowing indigenous microorganisms to use the halogenated contaminants as electron acceptors. EPA Anaerobic Bioremediation Technologies Additives are usually added to the subsurface through injection wells, although injection well technology for biostimulation purposes is still emerging. Removal of the contaminated material is also an option, albeit an expensive one. Biostimulation can be enhanced by bioaugmentation. This process, overall, is referred to as bioremediation and is an EPA-approved method for reversing the presence of oil or gas spills. While biostimulation is usually associated with remediation of hydrocarbon or high production volume chemical spills, it is also potentially useful for treatment of less frequently encountered contaminant spills, such as pesticides, particularly herbicides.
The primary advantage of biostimulation is that bioremediation will be undertaken by already present native microorganisms that are well-suited to the subsurface environment, and are well distributed spatially within the subsurface. The primary disadvantage is that the delivery of additives in a manner that allows the additives to be readily available to subsurface microorganisms is based on the local geology of the subsurface. Tight, impermeable subsurface lithology (tight clays or other fine-grained material) make it difficult to spread additives throughout the affected area. Fractures in the subsurface create preferential pathways in the subsurface which additives preferentially follow, preventing even distribution of additives.
Recently a number of products have been introduced which allow popular use of bioremediation using biostimulative methods. They may harness local bacteria using biostimulation by creating a hospitable environment for hydrocarbon-devouring microorganisms, or they may introduce foreign bacteria into the environment as a direct application to the hydrocarbon. While the jury is out as to whether either is particularly more effective than the other, prima facie consideration suggests the introduction of foreign bacteria to any environment stands a chance of mutating organisms already present and affecting the biome.
Investigations to determine subsurface characteristics (such as natural groundwater velocity during ambient conditions, hydraulic conductivity of the subsurface, and lithology of the subsurface) are important in developing a successful biostimulation system. In addition, a pilot-scale study of the potential biostimulation system should be undertaken prior to full-scale design and implementation.
However, some biostimulative agents may be used in chaotic surfaces such as open water and sand so long as they are [oleophilic], meaning that they bond exclusively to hydrocarbons, and basically sink in the water column, bonding to oil, where they then float to the water's surface, exposing the hydrocarbon to more abundant sunlight and oxygen where greater micro-organic aerobic activity can be encouraged. Some consumer-targeted biostimulants bond possess this quality, others do not.

The Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes ("National Museum of Fine Arts") is an Argentine art museum in Buenos Aires, located in the Recoleta section of the city. The Museum inaugurated a branch in Neuquén in 2004. The museum hosts works by Goya, Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Rodin, Manet and Chagall among other artists.
History
Argentine painter and art critic Eduardo Schiaffino, was the first director of the museum, which opened on 25 December 1895, in a building on Florida Street that today houses the Galerías Pacífico shopping mall. In 1909, the museum moved to a building in Plaza San Martín, originally erected in Paris as the Argentine Pavilion for the 1889 Paris exhibition, and later dismantled and brought to Buenos Aires. In its new home, the museum became part of the International Centenary Exhibition held in Buenos Aires in 1910. Following the demolition of the pavilion in 1932, as part of the remodeling of Plaza San Martín, the museum was transferred to its present location in 194
3, a building originally constructed in 1870 as a drainage pumping station and adapted to its current use by architect Alejandro Bustillo.
The museum was modernized both physically and in its collections during the 1955–64 tenure of director Jorge Romero Brest. A temporary exhibits pavilion opened in 1961, and the museum acquired a large volume of modern art though its collaboration with the Torcuato di Tella Institute, a leading promoter of local, avant-garde artists, and elsewhere; a contemporary Argentine art pavilion opened in 1980. This hall is the largest of 34 currently in use at the museum, which totals of exhibit space. Its permanent collection totals 688 major works and over 12,000 sketches, fragments, potteries, and other minor works. The institution also maintains a specialized library, totaling 150,000 volumes, as well as a public auditorium. The museum commissioned architect Mario Roberto Álvarez to design a branch in the Patagonian region city of Neuquén. Inaugurated in 2004, this museum has four exhibit halls totaling and a permanent collection of 215 works, as well as temporary exhibits and a public auditorium.
The ground floor of the museum holds 24 exhibit halls housing a fine international collection of paintings from the Middle Ages up to the 20th century, together with the museum's art history library. The first floor's eight exhibit halls contain a collection of paintings by some of the most important 20th-century Argentine painters, including Antonio Berni, Ernesto de la Cárcova, Benito Quinquela Martín, Eduardo Sívori, Sarah Grilo, Alfredo Guttero, Raquel Forner, Xul Solar, Marcelo Pombo and Lino Enea Spilimbergo. The second floor's two halls, completed in 1984, hold an exhibition of photographs and two sculpture terraces, as well as most of the institution's administrative and technical departments.

The Chinese Manichaean hymn scroll is a scroll found by British archaeologist Aurel Stein in the Mogao Grottoes. It contains a series of hymns used in religious ceremonies. It is currently in the collection of the British Library, number S.2659。
Introduction
The first volume of the manuscript is slightly incomplete, and the content is written in the form of poetry. Among them, there are 1254 sentences of seven-character poems, and a few four-character and five-character poems. According to Lin Wushu's research, these hymns were translated from a Middle Iranian language, rather than original by the Manicheans. Many of the contents are dedicated to the Jesus of Manichaeism-Yishu, and the hymn to the highest deity of Manichaeism.
In the 'Praise Jesus' text
After Manichaeism was introduced into China, because the image of Jesus was quite unfamiliar to Chinese culture, missionaries combined it with Buddhist imagery, called Jesus Buddha, and made him a model of great mercy and relief. Therefore, believers wrote in the following excerpt from the hymn "Praise Jesus Text", which is like a Buddhist scripture in the Chinese Manichaean hymn scroll.

The Puck Fair (Irish: Aonach an Phoic, meaning "Fair of the He-Goat", 'poc' being the Irish for a male goat) is one of Ireland's oldest fairs. It takes place annually from 10–12 August in Killorglin, County Kerry.
Description
Every year a group of people go up into the mountains and catch a wild goat. The goat is brought back to the town and the "Queen of Puck", traditionally a young school girl from one of the local primary schools, crowns the goat "King Puck".
The goat is then put into a small cage on a high stand for three days, and on the 3rd day of the fair, he is brought down to be led back to the mountains. In the middle of the town square, he is crowned and this signifies that the festivities may begin. The pubs stay open until 3.00 AM which is a legal exception due to the fair as all bars in Ireland normally must close at 2.00 AM. This is a source of contention with the local police.
Markets
Tradition dictates that a horse fair takes place on the first day and on the second day there is a cattle fair. There are usually many street vendors during the festival who advertise their wares to the large numbers of tourists who come to Killorglin for the fair.
History
The fair itself is purported to be ancient but can only officially be traced back as far as 1613 when King James I issued a charter granting legal status to the existing fair in Killorglin. Despite this fact, its roots are still unknown, although there are several legends of its origins.
One of the legends of the fair is that the event pays tribute to a goat that broke away from its herd, while the rest of the herd headed towards the mountains, and warned the town's inhabitants while the “Roundheads” were pillaging the countryside around Shanara and Kilgobnet at the foot of the McGillycuddy Reeks. The advancing army of Oliver Cromwell during his conquest of Ireland in the 17th century triggered the pillages around the countryside. The goat's arrival alerted the inhabitants of danger, and they immediately set out to protect the town and their herds. This is explained in the traditional Irish ballad, An Poc ar Buile (the Mad Puck Goat).
Scholars speculate that the fair's origins stem from Pre-Christian Ireland, from the Celtic festival of Lughnasa which symbolised the beginning of the harvest season, and that the goat is a pagan fertility symbol.
In 1931, Margaret Murray tied the Puck Fair into her version of the witch-cult hypothesis, asserting that it was a pre-Christian festival in honour of the Horned God. However, historians Jeffrey B. Russell and Brooks Alexander have asserted that "Today, scholars are agreed that Murray was more than just wrong – she was completely and embarrassingly wrong on nearly all of her basic premises."
In 1941, a ballet entitled Puck Fair, based on a poem about the fair by F.R. Higgins, was staged at the Gaiety Theatre. The ballet was choreographed by Cepta Cullen and composed by Elizabeth Maconchy, with set design by Mainie Jellet.
The 2020 and 2021 festivals were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the event returned in 2022. High temperatures necessitated taking the goat down from its high stand for a number of breaks.

The Pilgrim's Progress: The Third Part is a pseudepigraphic sequel to John Bunyan's 1678 novel The Pilgrim's Progress, written by an anonymous author. It was published with Bunyan's work in editions from 1693 to 1852 because it was believed to be written by Bunyan. It presents the pilgrimage of Tender-Conscience and his companions. In the 19th century it was bowdlerized to omit a few sexual situations and allusions.
Plot
Tender-Conscience, a native of the town of Vain Delights goes on the pilgrimage of Christian and Christiana to the Celestial City. He stops at some of the same places as they, but he encounters new places not visited by either Christian or Christiana and her party.
All of the lands that are outside of the Wicket Gate and the area encompassed by the "walls and borders of that region, wherein lay the way to the heavenly country" are known as the "Valley of Destruction." The time that Tender-Conscience begins his pilgrimage is a time of drought and heat, which is emblematic of a time of the persecution. Some of them are deterred in their progress, and return to their old homes in the Valley of Destruction during the night.
Tender-Conscience has a difficult time crossing the Slough of Despond, and he does not get by it without being covered in mud from it. This mud has the effect of weakening the body and blinding his eyes, and Tender-Conscience gropes along until he is overshadowed by a bright cloud from which a hand appears that washes away the mud enabling Tender-Conscience to continue his journey with vigor.
At the Wicket Gate Tender-Conscience does not escape the arrows shot against callers from Beelzebub's castle. These stick to his flesh and cause him to bleed profusely. Good-Will lets him in, and registers his name as a pilgrim. He gives Tender-Conscience a crutch that is made of wood from the Tree of Life (Lignum Vitæ). This crutch stanches the bleeding and strengthens Tender-Conscience, who must bear with the arrows of Beelzebub until he reaches the House of the Interpreter.
The Interpreter removes the arrows of Beelzebub from Tender-Conscience's body and lodges him for the night, showing him the same emblems and scenes enjoyed by Christian, Christiana, and their children and companions. The next day the Interpreter goes a little way with Tender-Conscience to where the King's Highway is walled on either side by the Wall of Salvation. Before they reach this wall they come to two farms on either side of the way. The farm on the right is well-cared for and the one on the left is not. The Interpreter tells Tender-Conscience that this provides an example to pilgrims that they should be like the caretaker of the farm on the right, who gradually improved his farm until it was in its present good condition.
Tender-Conscience when parted from the Interpreter comes to the place where Christian found the cross and the sepulchre. On either side of the cross were now erected two houses as competing lodging places for pilgrims. On the right was the House of Mourning, and on the left was the House of Mirth. The House of Mirth is like an ale house with carousing men, but the House of Mourning is tended by pious women called "matrons." Tender-Conscience decides to go to the House of Mourning despite the agitation induced in the men of the House of Mirth, who form a mob surrounding the House of Mourning demanding that Tender-Conscience be handed over to them. Three shining ones appear to Tender-Conscience promising to rescue him. The first shining one breathes on Tender-Conscience making him a new creature, the second clothes him in a white robe in place of his crimson clothes, and the third one gives him a sealed roll. With this change Tender-Conscience is able to get by unrecognized by the men from the House of Mirth and, so, go on his way.
At the Hill Difficulty Tender-Conscience had the choice of the three ways: the one going up the hill also called "Difficulty," the one going around the right hand of the hill called "Danger," and the one going around the left side of the hill called "Destruction." The broadness and pleasantness of the two byways induced Tender-Conscience to take the right-hand byway Danger. He thought that this way would also lead him to the top of the hill, but the growing denseness of the forest surrounding the way and the howlings of wild beasts that he heard induced him to go back to the foot of the hill. He then remembered the Bible passages that characterized the right way as narrow, so he chose to go up the hill by way of the steep and narrow path.
Working his way up the hill, he is taken into two caves tended by Good-resolution and Contemplation where he is shown alabaster statues of famous pilgrims from the Bible who had gone on before, and an image of the Celestial City from a carved diamond. He is given respite and food by Good-Resolution, who warns him about places he should avoid staying while on the hill, and then he continues on the path, where he is stopped by a flattering man Spiritual-Pride, who convinces him there is a quicker way to his award, and leads him to a tower of Lofty-Thoughts with the plans of throwing Tender-Conscience off it, and dashing upon the bottom of the hill below. Tender remembers the warnings from Good-resolution, and he runs away, going on further he is stopped by an old man, Carnal-Security, who also convinces him to turn from the road, and he leads to a grand palace tended by the old man's wife Intemperance and his daughters Wantonness and Forgetfulness, where he is enticed to drink wine, dabbles with Wantonness and fall asleep in Forgetfulness' arms. Servants carry him inside and put him on a bed, and music begins to play with the intent of keeping him asleep until he dies, in which case his corpse would be carried down the hill to the path of Destruction, tossed into the fiery Lake of Destruction at the end of the road and die the 'second death'. Tender's crutch awakens him, and he gets up, and a storm and voices in his ear urge him to escape. On the way he runs into Gluttony who tries to get him stay for a feast that is prepared for him; avoiding that, he runs into the old man, who tries to convince him to stay, and if he will not to take another drink of the grapes before he leaves. Tender continues to run from the debate, and as he passes the fountain in the palace courtyard Wantonness, who is bathing in it, arises out naked and tries to seduce Tender. He narrowly avoids her grasp to escape, and run back to the main highway on the hill, and reaches the House Beautiful and is let in due to his pass.
At the palace, Tender has long conversations with the virgins Discretion, Charity, Prudence, and Piety about how he escaped danger on the way up the hill, and then is taken to a feast, where he was served by others of the society (Temperance, Decency, Frugality and Bounty). He then has a conversation on how they came to that place themselves to take on their positions (they were devotees to the woman Religion who originally lived there, and promised to keep her rules), and the discussion of the role of healthy food and moderation in a Christian lifestyle.
Tender sets off again, reaching the Valley of Humuliation, which has been covered with traps, nets and gins set up by the prince of the air, to stop high-minded pilgrims from proceeding further. Tender realizes he has to crawl under them in order to make any progress. He reaches a bridge, and is met with men in rowboats he thought might be murderers and robbers who infested the place. They began to shoot arrows at him, some of which missed him, and others which hit the shield he had received from House Beautiful. The men shooting at him included Worldly-honour, Arrogancy, Pride, Self-conceit, Vain-glory, and Shame. The last of these wounded him in his cheek, but barely drew blood. He continued on until he was past the bridge, and could again walk upright, and then praised the Lord.
Tender finally reached the Valley of Shadow of Death...
Context
The first part of the Pilgrim's Progress was very popular and elicited many anonymous second parts, few of which survive. Bunyan appeared to intend to write a third part but died before it could be completed. This false third part was denounced as early as 1708 but remained quite popular.

Robert Frier RSA (1855–1912) was a Scottish artist. He specialised in landscapes.
Life
He was born in Edinburgh in 1855. His father also Robert was a draper with a shop on the Lawnmarket in the Old Town and living at Ratcliffe Terrace in the South Side. As there is a Robert Frier exhibiting at the Royal Scottish Academy from 1853 this may indicate that his father also had artistic talent. His older brother Henry (Harry) Frier (1849-1921) was also an artist.
In 1880 he was living in a flat at 62 Queen Street, Edinburgh.
By 1890 he is living in a much larger house at 108 George Street and is listed as a "landscape artist and teacher of drawing and painting".
By 1895 he has left Edinburgh, possibly to live with his brother Henry in London.

"Williams' Blood" is a single by Grace Jones, released in 2008.
Background
"Williams' Blood" is an autobiographical song, written by Jones and music duo Wendy & Lisa, explaining how Jones takes after her mother's, Marjorie Jones née Williams, musical side of the family rather than that of her disciplinarian father Reverend Robert Jones. According to the lyrics, Jones' mother reveals that her grandfather was a musician who traveled with Nat King Cole, womanizing and drinking from town to town. The song describes her family's lament that she isn't more of a Jones like her sister or brother Noel while she expresses her desire to be free. In the song's introduction Jones adapts a line from the first stanza of "Amazing Grace" declaring, "You can't save a wretch like me". At the end of the track when Jones sings the first two lines of "Amazing Grace", her mother Marjorie, a lyric soprano, can be heard singing the same hymn in church. The song's working title was "Keeping up with the Joneses", an idiom heard in the lyrics.
Time Out London described the composition as "among the most personal songs she's ever recorded, celebrating the contradictions between Grace's religious family background and outré public persona". The Independent said the song "employs handclaps and choral refrain to build up an almost gospel fervour".
The song was released as the second single from Hurricane in late 2008. 1,000 12" singles were released featuring mixes by Mad Professor, Greg Wilson, Ivor Guest and Aeroplane. A balearic disco remix by the latter was initially rejected by Jones' label but eventually approved.
Music video
A music video consisting of clips from the June 2008 Meltdown performance, dubbed with the edited studio version of the song, premiered on Hurricanes official website in early January 2009. It was uploaded onto YouTube on 5 February 2009. A Chris Cunningham-directed music video was reportedly in production in late 2008 but remains unreleased.

Section.80 is the debut studio album by American rapper Kendrick Lamar. It was released on July 2, 2011, by Top Dawg Entertainment. Leading up to its release, Lamar previously produced various mixtapes under the moniker K.Dot. Following the 2010 release of Overly Dedicated, Lamar began working on Section.80.
The production of Section.80 was mainly handled by TDE in-house producers from production group Digi+Phonics, as well as THC, Tommy Black, Wyldfyer, Terrace Martin and J. Cole. A concept album, it features lyrical themes delivered by Lamar such as the 1980s crack epidemic, racism and the medication tolerance of Generation Y. The album features guest appearances from GLC, Colin Munroe, Ashtrobot, BJ the Chicago Kid, Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul and vocals from late singer-songwriter Alori Joh.
Section.80 received generally positive reviews from critics upon its release. The album debuted at number 113 on the US Billboard 200 and as of February 2014, it has sold 130,000 copies domestically. In April 2017, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
Background
Prior to the album's release, Kendrick Lamar released various mixtapes under the K.Dot moniker. The first of these mixtapes, titled Youngest Head Nigga in Charge, landed Lamar a recording contract with Top Dawg Entertainment. Through Top Dawg Entertainment, Lamar would release four mixtapes, including Overly Dedicated. Lamar felt compelled to create the album after seeing a friend of his go-to jail for twenty-five years and experiencing the pain of such an event.
Recording
Lamar began working on the album sometime in January 2011. The album was recorded at Top Dawg Studios in Carson, California. Most of the album was written in Lamar's mother's kitchen and his tour bus. While recording the album, Lamar wished for it to be "as organic as possible," at times leaving songs unfinished for extended periods of time.
Music and lyrics
Section.80 is a concept album that involves the lives of Tammy and Keisha as it explains the personal hardships in their lives. "Tammy's Song (Her Evils)" revolves around two girls cheating on their boyfriends after discovering they were unfaithful, and eventually sleeping with each other because they can't trust men; "Keisha's Song (Her Pain)" is about a prostitute who seeks comfort and control, only to her demise.
Lamar has stated that he created the album to discuss his generation. Lamar dwells on a variety of subjects, such as the crack epidemic occurred in the 80s and Ronald Reagan.
On "A.D.H.D", Lamar addresses "getting fucked up, going to parties, and just being carefree", while "Kush & Corinthians" notes that justice and morals are rarely cut and dried. The album's lead single and final song, "HiiiPoWeR", explains the "HiiiPoWeR" movement promoted by Lamar and his Top Dawg Entertainment labelmates. The song came from Lamar's interactions with fellow rapper J. Cole and TDE president Punch.
The song "Ronald Reagan Era" features uncredited vocal recordings by RZA, which Kendrick mentions in an Interview with Complex in 2011 were orchestrated by DJ Fricktion from London, who at the time was working with RZA on various records.
Marketing and sales
Section.80 was released on July 2, 2011. In its first week, the album sold 5,000 copies in the United States and debuted at number 113 on the US Billboard 200, with minimal mainstream media promotion and coverage. Within a two-week period, the album sold a total of 9,000 copies in the United States, and as of February 2014, the album has sold 130,000 copies domestically. On April 14, 2017, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over 500,000 units.
Critical reception
Section.80 was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 80, based on 11 reviews.
Andres Tardio of HipHopDX praised the album, writing that Lamar "may have been searching for answers, but that journey allowed him to find out of this year's most outstanding albums with Section.80." Reviewing the album for Pitchfork, Tom Breihan believed that, "self-serious flaws and all, Section.80 still stands as a powerful document of a tremendously promising young guy figuring out his voice." In the opinion of XXL journalist Adam Fleischer, the record reveals "its author's brain is neither lost nor useless, as he weaves together carefully constructed thoughts before spewing raps on each of the project's 16 tracks, ensuring nothing is disposable or without purpose." David Amidon from PopMatters compared Lamar to an Ice Cube early in his career, as "he's only telling us what he sees, and while he might not offer solutions as often as [Ice Cube] did, he's certainly able to paint us vivid a picture." Tom Hull said Lamar "runs a song about 'niggas and ho's' so far into the ground he can raise a flagpole in top of it, but also recalls the evils of the Reagan Era, which is pretty good for a guy who was just born as Iran-Contra piled up."
Pitchfork placed the album at number 45 on its list of the "Top 50 albums of 2011". Complex named the album the 7th best album of 2011. In honor of Section.80s fifth anniversary, Forbes columnist Ogden Payne wrote an article explaining how the album had propelled Lamar into "hip-hop royalty", deeming it "the genesis to Kendrick Lamar successfully balancing social commentary with mass appeal, while simultaneously laying the foundation for his label as King Kendrick". NME placed the album at number three on their list of "101 Albums To Hear Before You Die" in 2014.

Smokey the Cannon is a replica Civil War artillery cannon that has served as part of the pageantry of college football games at the University of Texas at Austin since 1953. Smokey the Cannon is owned and operated by the Texas Cowboys (an honorary men's service organization at Texas) and is stationed in the left corner of the south endzone at Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium during every Texas Longhorns home football game. After each football season, Smokey the Cannon is generally displayed in the Red McCombs Red Zone atrium for the spring semester.
Smokey the Cannon is shot off at every Texas Longhorns score, kick-off, end of quarter, and most importantly, it is fired off after the world-famous college fight song, "The Eyes of Texas" at the conclusion of every Texas football game.
In addition to all home football games, Smokey the Cannon is present at the annual Texas vs. Oklahoma Red River Rivalry game in Dallas, Texas every October, as well as at other select football games outside of Austin, Texas (barring local and stadium permission). Recently, Smokey the Cannon was present at the 2011 Holiday Bowl, in which the Texas Longhorns beat the Cal Golden Bears 21-10 on December 29, 2011; former Texas Cowboy Oldman, Blaine Irby caught 1 pass for 30 yards in the win.
The Cannon has appeared at countless charity and volunteer events across the country and is maintained and transported by the Cannon Crew — a team of four Oldmen, voted on by the entire organization each spring. During the 2012 spring semester, "Smokey III" appeared at Congregation Beth Yeshurun Synagogue in Houston, Texas to honor the Berry family who lost two parents in a car accident in July 2011.
History
Originally, Smokey I was created by the University of Texas at Austin's mechanical engineering lab in 1953, in response to shotgun blasts often heard at the Red River Rivalry. Two years later, Smokey I was modified in 1955 to shoot twin 10-gauge shotgun shells and the revision was renamed "Smokey II". "Smokey II" was used by the Texas Cowboys for over 30 years.
The current version of the cannon, Smokey III, weighs 1,200 pounds and fires up to four blank 10-gauge shells at a time. Smokey III was built by Lupton Machine of Austin, out of the trunk of an oak tree in 1988 and purchased by the Texas Cowboys Alumni Association for $25,000. Smokey III is transported in the Texas Cowboys' trailer along with a wooden toolbox containing all necessary items to operate the cannon.

Red's Dream is a 1987 American computer-animated short film written and directed by John Lasseter and produced by Pixar. The short film, which runs four minutes, stars Red, a unicycle. Propped up in the corner of a bicycle store on a rainy night, Red dreams of a fantasy where it becomes the star of a circus. Red's Dream was Pixar's second computer-animated short following Luxo Jr. in 1986, also directed by Lasseter.
Red's Dream is more strongly character-driven than Luxo Jr., Pixar's previous short film. The short was designed to demonstrate new technical innovations in imagery. The short was created by employing the company's own Pixar Image Computer, but the computer's memory limitations led the animation group to abandon it for further projects. Space was growing tight at the company, and as a result, Lasseter and his team worked out of a hallway during production, where Lasseter sometimes slept for days on end.
The short premiered at the annual SIGGRAPH conference in Anaheim on July 10, 1987, and received general enthusiasm from its attendants. Red's Dream was never attached to any later Pixar feature, unlike many other early Pixar shorts. The film was released for home video as part of Tiny Toy Stories in 1996 and Pixar Short Films Collection, Volume 1 in 2007.
Plot
On a rainy night in an unnamed, deserted city where no one can be seen, a red unicycle named Red is lying in the clearance corner of a bicycle shop called "Eben's Bikes". Red dreams of being the center of a circus act, which is represented within a dream sequence in which it is ridden by a circus clown named Lumpy. After cycling onstage to little fanfare, Lumpy begins a juggling act with three colored balls, which he continually drops by accident, prompting the unicycle to roll out from underneath him and catch them. Eventually, Lumpy accidentally launches one of the balls out of the ring, prompting Red to go out and retrieve it without his notice. After realizing that his unicycle is out from beneath his feet, Lumpy falls and disappears from the dream, after which Red catches the other two balls and juggles them to an uproarious applause; however, the dream ends, and Red awakens after bowing to the audience, realizing that it is still in the bike shop. Depressed, it returns to the corner where it was previously resting and becomes inanimate again.
Production
Red's Dream was the 2nd short film produced by computer animation studio Pixar, following their previous 1986 film, Luxo Jr. For their next short film, which was to be presented at the 1987 SIGGRAPH convention, Ed Catmull wanted the Pixar staff to make a film that made use the Pixar Image Computer and the rendering software Chapreyes. Lasseter began to develop a story about a circus clown who is upstaged by his own unicycle, while William Reeves and Eben Ostby were simultaneously working on their own ideas; Ostby had wanted to animate a bicycle, and Reeves was working on creating a rainy setting in a city. Ultimately, the three combined their ideas, which resulted in the development of Red's Dream. The idea of a bicycle shop for a setting was inspired by Ostby, a cycling enthusiast and graphics programmer at Pixar, who had been working on generating a complex still image of a bike shop. Lasseter, Reeves and Ostby wanted to try and give the film a distinctly "dark and moody" look by having it take place in a rainy city setting. When developing the story for the film, Lasseter said that he wanted to create something with more "pathos" behind it, jokingly referring the film's development as Pixar's "blue period" due to the emotional drive behind the short.
The film project came with two technical rationales; the bike shop scenes at the beginning and end were intended to demonstrate the rendering of highly complex imagery. Due to the geographical complexity the spoked bikes and the shop fixtures, a typical frame of animation from the scenes contained more than ten thousand geometric primitives, which in turn were made up of more than thirty million polygons. The dream sequences. on the other hand, was to demonstrate the rendering capabilities of the Pixar Image Computer. An engineer named Tony Apodaca had converted Pixar's rendering software to run on the PIC, but it turned out that the machine's design left its processors without enough memory to use a program as complex as Chapreyes, and thus Apodaca was able to convert only a portion of its features for use with the computers. On account of these limitations, the dream sequence ended up looking cruder than the rest of the film, and Red's Dream was both the first and last Pixar film to be made using the PIC. The clown, nicknamed "Lumpy" by the filmmakers, was one of Pixar's first human characters; in order to give him an "organic" facial structure, the character was first sculpted into a model and then scanned into a computer using a digitizer. The scenes with juggling were created by animating the unicycle's path, and then put the balls into the setting, with a quadratic programming algorithm automatically calculating their traveling path. Due to the PIC's incapability of performing any motion blur, Lasseter instead used squash and stretch, which was also calculated by the QP, to convincingly animate the bouncing balls.
As Red's Dream was being developed, space at Pixar was growing tight in its Marin County bungalow; during production, the animation group, consisting of Lasseter alongside several "technical directors" who created models and shaders and such, worked out of a hallway. Towards the end of production, Lasseter worked and slept in the hallways for days on end. One night, about two weeks before the deadline for SIGGRAPH, an engineer named Jeff Mock brought his camcorder around and shot an ersatz interview with Lasseter, who joked about the conditions. He had just spent five days animating a sequence of three hundred frames-twelve and a half seconds of film.
Shortly following the completion of Red's Dream, animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, two of Walt Disney's legendary original nine animators known as the "Nine Old Men", visited Lasseter at Pixar and they watched a screening. Thomas was evidently freed of his former doubts about computer animation, expressed in a 1984 essay in which he argued computer animation could never produce anything as meaningful as its hand-drawn predecessor. After watching the film, he shook Lasseter's hand and stated meaningfully to him, "John, you did it."

Diane was a 38-gun frigate of the French Navy, launched in 1796. She participated in the battle of the Nile, but in August 1800 the Royal Navy captured her. She was taken into British service as HMS Niobe, and broken up in 1816.
French career
She took part in the Battle of the Nile, managing to escape to Malta with . During the battle Rear-Admiral Denis Decrès was on board Diane in his capacity as commander of the frigate squadron. He would go on to become Napoleon's Minister of Marine.
In 1800, as she tried to escape from Malta, , , and HMS Genereux captured her. At the time she had only 114 men on board, having left the remainder at Malta to assist in its defense.
British career
The Royal Navy commissioned her as HMS Niobe, under the command of Captain John Wentworth Loring, there already being an in service.
On 28 March 1806, Niobe was off Groix when she captured the 16-gun , which had just separated from Leduc's division.
Niobe, still under Captain Loring, and , Commander James Stuart, captured the Danish ship King of Assianthe on 31 August 1807.
On 13 November 1810, off Le Havre along with Diana, Niobe sighted the 40-gun and the 44-gun . and joined the chase, attacking the French squadron when it was anchored at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue at the action of 15 November 1810. Eventually, Elisa was wrecked near La Hougue, while Amazone escaped to Le Havre. Four months later at the action of 24 March 1811, Niobe participated in the destruction of the French frigate Amazone near the Phare de Gatteville lighthouse, Normandy.
On 24 March 1811, she sailed with a squadron comprising HMS Berwick, , , and , again chased Amazone, which they trapped near Barfleur. Amazones crew scuttled her to prevent her capture.
Fate
HMS Niobe was eventually sold on 31 July 1816.

Vittoria della Rovere (7 February 1622 – 5 March 1694) was Grand Duchess of Tuscany as the wife of Grand Duke Ferdinando II. She had four children with her husband, two of whom would survive infancy: the future Cosimo III, Tuscany's longest-reigning monarch, and Francesco Maria, a prince of the Church. At the death of her grandfather Francesco Maria della Rovere, she inherited the Duchies of Rovere and Montefeltro, which reverted to her second son, Francesco Maria, at her death. She was later entrusted with the care of her three grandchildren. Her marriage brought a wealth of treasures to the House of Medici, which can today be seen in the Palazzo Pitti and the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.
Infancy
Vittoria della Rovere was the only child of Federico Ubaldo della Rovere, son of the then incumbent Duke of Urbino, Francesco Maria. Her mother was Claudia de' Medici, a sister of Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and the Duchess of Mantua. As an infant it was expected that she would inherit her grandfather's Duchy of Urbino, but Pope Urban VIII convinced Francesco Maria to resign it to the Papacy. The duchy was eventually annexed to the Papal States by Pope Urban VIII. Instead, she received the Rovere allodial possessions, the Duchies of Rovere and Montefeltro, and art collection which became her property in 1631 aged nine.
At the age of one, Vittoria was betrothed to her Medici first cousin Ferdinando II, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Under the influence of her Medici mother, she was sent to Florence to be brought up at the Tuscan court. The marriage was arranged by the Grand Duke's grandmother, Christina of Lorraine, who had been acting as joint regent with her daughter-in-law Maria Maddalena of Austria since 1621. Despite Ferdinando II reaching his majority in 1628, Dowager Grand Duchess Christina remained the power behind the throne till her demise in 1636.
Grand Duchess of Tuscany
On 2 August 1634 she privately married Ferdinando, while the official public marriage was celebrated on 6 April 1637. Vittoria was crowned on the next 5 July. Her inheritance was included in her dowry which was offered to the Medici. These rich art collections of the family, now in the Uffizi and Palazzo Pitti, thus became the property of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Brought up in the convent of Crocetta, Vittoria's education was a deeply religious one administered by the Dowager Grand Duchesses who had aligned Tuscany with the Papal States. Her education caused her to be ruled by priests in later life much to the annoyance of her liberal husband.
The marriage was consummated six years after the marriage ceremony and Vittoria gave birth to a son who died at the age of two days. Another son followed in 1640 but died at birth. Finally in 1642 the couple had another son named Cosimo de' Medici who was styled the Grand Prince of Tuscany. Under the influence of their mother, her children also received a deeply Roman Catholic education, and arguments between the Grand Ducal couple were sparked when there was a disagreement about the education of the Grand Prince. Shortly after the birth of Cosimo, the couple became estranged: Vittoria caught her husband and a page, Count Bruto della Molera, in bed together. The incident initially caused Vittoria to refuse to speak to her husband. When she decided to try to come to terms with him, however, he declined to be reconciled, and it was almost twenty years before their quarrel was properly made up. They briefly reconciled in 1659, which resulted in the birth of their last child, Prince Francesco Maria, in 1660. The estranged couple had, at best, an unhappy marriage, and lived separately by mutual agreement for many years.
Ferdinando II died in 1670 and was thus succeeded by the then Grand Prince as Cosimo III. He had been married to Marguerite Louise d'Orléans, first cousin of Louis XIV of France, in 1661. A son, Prince Ferdinando, and a daughter, Princess Anna Maria Luisa, were born within four years, and weeks after the accession of Cosimo III, Marguerite Louise was pregnant again. Vittoria della Rovere and her haughty daughter-in-law vied with each other for power. Thanks to her influence over her son, it was Vittoria who triumphed. Cosimo III went so far as to assign his mother the day-to-day administration of Tuscany. As a result, Vittoria was formally admitted into the Grand Duke's Consulta, or "Privy Council", leaving an embittered Marguerite Louise to her own devices. The two Grand Duchesses frequently quarrelled over precedence and the Consulta, but Cosimo III always took his mother's side, which only fuelled the ever-growing rages of Orléans. Orléans was left to the supervision of her son, the Grand Prince Ferdinando. By early 1671, fighting between Marguerite Louise and Vittoria became so heated that a contemporary remarked that "the Pitti Palace has become the devil's own abode, and from morn till midnight only the noise of wrangling and abuse could be heard".
Vittoria triumphed when news of her daughter-in-law's pending departure to France came in 1674. The younger grand duchess had lived in virtual imprisonment at the Medici Villa in Poggio a Caiano outside Florence for sometime. Eventually, the Grand Ducal couple decided to separate on the condition that Orléans stay at the Abbey Saint Pierre de Montmartre in Paris. Orléans left Tuscany in 1675 never to return. As a result of the abandonment of her children, Vittoria della Rovere was made guardian of her grandchildren: Grand Prince Ferdinando, Princess Anna Maria Luisa and Prince Gian Gastone.
Retiring from politics, in her old age, she made long stays in the convent of the Montalve, known as Villa La Quiete, as well as in the Villa del Poggio Imperiale, to which she transferred some of the art collection she had inherited. Vittoria della Rovere, Grand Duchess of Tuscany, died in Pisa in 1694 at the age of seventy-two. She was buried at the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence. At her death her son Francesco Maria, Cardinal since 1686, inherited the Rovere duchies. The titles became extinct with the extinction of the House of Medici with the death of her grandson Gian Gastone de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1737. Her only granddaughter Electress Palatine Anna Maria Luisa willed the contents of the Medici properties to the Tuscan state in 1743. The so-called Family Pact ensured that Medicean art and treasures spanning over nearly three centuries would remain in Florence along with what was once Vittoria's inheritance.

Wugunai (1021–1074) was a chieftain of the Wanyan tribe, the most dominant among the Jurchen tribes which later founded the Jin dynasty (1115–1234). He was the eldest son of Shilu. Like his father, Wugunai was appointed chieftain of the Wanyan tribe by the Khitan-led Liao dynasty, which ruled northern China between the 10th and 11th centuries. Historical sources describe Wugunai as a brave warrior, great eater and hard drinker, and a lover of women.
Wugunai was posthumously honoured with the temple name Jingzu (景祖) by his descendant, Emperor Xizong.

In mathematics, the well-ordering theorem, also known as Zermelo's theorem, states that every set can be well-ordered. A set X is well-ordered by a strict total order if every non-empty subset of X has the least element under the ordering. The well-ordering theorem together with Zorn's lemma are the most important mathematical statements that are equivalent to the axiom of choice (often called AC, see also ). Ernst Zermelo introduced the axiom of choice as an "unobjectionable logical principle" to prove the well-ordering theorem. One can conclude from the well-ordering theorem that every set is susceptible to transfinite induction, which is considered by mathematicians to be a powerful technique. One famous consequence of the theorem is the Banach–Tarski paradox.
History
Georg Cantor considered the well-ordering theorem to be a "fundamental principle of thought". However, it is considered difficult or even impossible to visualize a well-ordering of ; such a visualization would have to incorporate the axiom of choice. In 1904, Gyula Kőnig claimed to have proven that such a well-ordering cannot exist. A few weeks later, Felix Hausdorff found a mistake in the proof. It turned out, though, that in first order logic the well-ordering theorem is equivalent to the axiom of choice, in the sense that the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms with the axiom of choice included are sufficient to prove the well-ordering theorem, and conversely, the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms without the axiom of choice but with the well-ordering theorem included are sufficient to prove the axiom of choice. (The same applies to Zorn's lemma.) In second order logic, however, the well-ordering theorem is strictly stronger than the axiom of choice: from the well-ordering theorem one may deduce the axiom of choice, but from the axiom of choice one cannot deduce the well-ordering theorem.
There is a well-known joke about the three statements, and their relative amenability to intuition:The axiom of choice is obviously true, the well-ordering principle obviously false, and who can tell about Zorn's lemma?
Proof of equivalence to axiom of choice
The well-ordering theorem follows from the axiom of choice as follows.Let the set we are trying to well-order be A, and let f be a choice function for the family of non-empty subsets of A. For every ordinal α, define a set that's in A by setting if this complement is nonempty, or leave undefined if it is. That is, is chosen from the set of elements of A that have not yet been assigned a place in the ordering (or undefined if the entirety of A has been successfully enumerated). Then is a well-order of A as desired.
Proof of axiom of choice
The axiom of choice can be proven from the well-ordering theorem as follows.
To make a choice function for a collection of non-empty sets, E, take the union of the sets in E and call it X. There exists a well-ordering of X; let R be such an ordering. The function that to each set S of E associates the smallest element of S, as ordered by (the restriction to S of) R, is a choice function for the collection E.
An essential point of this proof is that it involves only a single arbitrary choice, that of R; applying the well-ordering theorem to each member S of E separately would not work, since the theorem only asserts the existence of a well-ordering, and choosing for each S a well-ordering would require just as many choices as simply choosing an element from each S. Particularly, if E contains uncountably many sets, making all uncountably many choices is not allowed under the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice.

It is located on the border of the counties of Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire; parts of the village lie in the civil parishes of Edlesborough and Ivinghoe in eastern Buckinghamshire, while the rest of the village is mainly within the parish of Little Gaddesden (where the population was included) in the west of Hertfordshire. Ringshall lies within the HP4 postcode and the postal address designated by Royal Mail is "Ringshall, ".
History
Ringshall is one of four place-names in the parish of Edlesborough Northall and Dagnall that have an origin with the suffix healh; the others being Dagnall, Hudnall and Northall. Ringshall-Hall Farm is situated in the Edlesborough part, but the hamlet was always appendant to Ivinghoe. The Ivinghoe part of the hamlet was transferred to Little Gaddesden in 1895, but some houses have since been built along Beacon Road in the area that remained as part of Ivinghoe parish.
Landmarks
Ringshall is close to Ashridge House, a former stately home that is now in use as a management college. A crenellated Gothic Revival stone gatehouse stands in Ringshall at an entrance to the Ashridge estate which was probably designed 1808-1813 by James Wyatt, architect of Ashridge House.
Ringshall lies on the edge of the Ashridge Commons and Woods, an extensive a country estate of dense woodland which is managed by the National Trust. Moneybury Hill, a woodland next to Ringshall, is especially noted as it was landscaped by the celebrated English landscape architect Capability Brown between 1759 and 1768 for the Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater. Nearby Dockey Wood is also noted as an example of bluebell woods.
From the 1930s to the 1990s, the Deer Leap swimming pool operated in Ringshall, drawing large numbers of visitors to the hamlet.

Brigadier general William Frederick Savery Edwards (1872–1941), commonly referred to as Brigadier-General W. F. S. Edwards, was a decorated British military officer who was appointed by the British Colonial Administration as the first Inspector General of the Uganda Protectorate Police, which later became the Uganda Police, and the simultaneous overall commander of the then British East Africa Police.
He was the first military member of the colonial British military appointed by the British Crown to lead the Uganda Police Force and the entire law enforcement machinery in British East Africa.
When the Uganda Protectorate Police officially became the Uganda police, he was the first duly appointed Inspector General of the same.
Career
Edwards was a professional military officer by training. Upon his arrival in Uganda, in 1906, he took on more than just the Inspector General position of the British East Africa Police and of the Uganda Police; he also eventually took on the military command of British and local African soldiers serving the British Empire—who, that at the time, were poised to confront the German military front in East Africa. Per the words contained in the official (Kenya) Gazette, his appointment orders extended to the Uganda Protectorate "Prisons" system.
Considered an "indefatigable worker, a stickler for efficiency [and] a stern disciplinarian," Edwards was a leader who represented and protected the strategic interests of the then British Empire in colonial East Africa.
Military leadership over civilian police forces in colonial territory was typical under British rule. Following General Edwards' leadership, other British military officers came to the helm of Uganda's police leadership until 1950.
Edwards commanded Port Amelia Force (PAMFORCE) that opposed German incursions into Portuguese East Africa (current Mozambique). He also commanded the East Africa Expeditionary Forces (during the East African campaign (World War I), and a contingency Force code-named Edforce.

Mariana Marin (February 10, 1956 – March 31, 2003) was a Romanian poet.
One of the most gifted and uncompromising poets of the 1980s generation, Adam J. Sorkin described her as "a distinctive voice revealed from the dark night of humanity's soul."
Life and poetry
She was brought up by her mother and her grandmother after her parents' separation, when she was three.
Educated in Bucharest during the time of the Romanian relative cultural freedom of the 1960s, she went on to receive a degree in philology from the University of Bucharest in 1980, starting a grade school teacher career that lasted almost ten years, first in a village along the Danube, then in Bucharest. Her first poetry book, Un război de o sută de ani (A Hundred Year War) was published next year and won the Romanian Writers' Union Prize for a debut in poetry. In 1982 Marin appeared alongside four other '80s writers in a collective volume, Cinci (Five), under the patronage of Nicolae Manolescu, who's so-called "Monday Poetry Circle" all of them used to attend.
More and more overtly opposed to the Nicolae Ceauşescu's dictatorship, her next volume, Aripa secretă (The Secret Annex) employed a not uncommon strategy to circumvent censorship by creating a fantastic diary of, and dialogue with Anne Frank, a thinly disguised metaphor for life in the open-air camp that Romania had become into during the last years of communist rule. She was banned to publish and joined the ranks of silenced intellectual voices until the collapse of the regime in 1989.
For a number of years after 1990, Marin divided her time between Paris and Bucharest. She worked at "Contrapunct", an independent spirited Romanian literary-cultural magazine, involving herself in various journalistic projects. During the decade she travelled a lot, invited to various European literary festivals. Her next book, Mutilarea artistului la tinereţe (The Mutilation of the Artist in his Youth) was unanimously acclaimed and won a number of major literary prizes. In the fall of 2000 she spent six months in Berlin on a writing fellowship and a year later she won the "Virgil Mazilescu" special literary prize.
Navigating between enthusiasm and disappointment during those troubled years following the fall of the communism, barely making ends meet, she survived with the help of friends and aid from the Writers' Union, before descending into chronic alcoholism and developing TB. Despite her misery and ills, she kept writing.
In 2002 she published a career retrospective, Zestrea de aur (The Dowry of Gold), her final book.
She was married and divorced twice, she had no children.

Joan Jacobs Brumberg (born April 29, 1944) is an American social historian and writes and lectures in the fields of women's history and medical history. Her first appointment at Cornell University (1979) was in Women's Studies and Human Development. From that point, her research, teaching and writing have been interdisciplinary and focused on gender. She is a Professor Emerita of Cornell University, and lectures and writes about the experiences of adolescents through history until the present day. In the subject area of Gender Studies, she has written about boys and violence, and girls and body image.
Her 1987 book, Fasting Girls: The Emergence of Anorexia Nervosa as A Modern Disease won four major disciplinary awards: the Berkshire Book Prize (in women's history); the John Hope Franklin Prize ( in American Studies), the Eileen Basker Prize (in medical anthropology) and the Watson Davis Prize (in history of Science writing). Book Riot included it as one of the 100 best books in the history of medicine.
The Body Project: A History of American Girls (1997) was based on diaries written by adolescents from the pre Civil War Era until 1980s. Although the author admired certain Victorian protections for girls, she also urged a new code of sexual ethics for a post virginal age. The book received special recognition from Voice of Youth Advocates. Brumberg has also worked collaboratively with photographer Lauren Greenfield on Girl Culture (2002) and Thin (2006).
In light of the contemporary debates over the juvenile death penalty, she wrote Kansas Charley: The Boy Murderer (2004) which explored the case of an immigrant adolescent murderer who was hanged in Cheyenne, Wyoming in 1898. Brumberg research shows boys in early adolescence are not psychologically developed enough to be liable for their actions to the extent of an adult. Her work was used in arguments against the juvenile death penalty.
Her first book, Mission for Life: The Judson Family and American Evangelical Culture (1978) won Honorable Mention from The Society of Church History.
Brumberg was a John Simon Guggenheim Fellow and also had awards from the Rockefeller Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities. She was twice a fellow at the MacDowell Colony and is a fellow of the Society for American Historians. Brumberg was named a Stephen Weiss Presidential Fellow and Professor, an award given for excellence in undergraduate teaching.

The Roger B. Chaffee Planetarium, named for astronaut Roger B. Chaffee, was constructed in the early 1960s as part of the Public Museum of Grand Rapids. The facility initially featured a plaster dome and a Goto Optics mechanical star projector. Among the planetarium's first shows was "Star of Wonder", an astronomical attempt at an explanation of the Star of Bethlehem. The show received positive reviews in the Grand Rapids area and remained in the Chaffee's catalogue for several years.
The Chaffee, then known as the Planetarium of the Public Museum of Grand Rapids, came under the curatorship of David L. DeBruyn in 1964. A young man fresh out of college at the University of Michigan, DeBruyn helped found the Great Lakes Planetarium Association in 1965, hosting the first meeting in Grand Rapids. In 1967 the theater was dedicated as the Roger B. Chaffee Planetarium, following the death of the astronaut in the Apollo 1 mission.
During the late 1960s the Grand Rapids Amateur Astronomical Association began a project to construct a new dark sky observatory in the Grand Rapids area. A site was leased to them on Kissing Rock Hill and the James C. Veen Observatory was constructed by the Association members, with some support from the Public Museum and Chaffee Planetarium. Today the Veen remains tied to the museum and the Chaffee.
In 1994 the planetarium was relocated to a new facility, along with the entire museum, where it would feature a new aluminum dome and the state-of the art projection system: a prototype of the Evans and Sutherland Digistar II digital star projector, running on Digistar software. Within a few years this was upgraded to software for Digistar II. The system also features three Sony video projectors, a Barco video projector, scores of Kodak ektagraphic slide projectors and even more special effect projectors and devices. The planetarium is well known for its many educational programs, as well as its unique library of laser light shows, many programmed at the Chaffee itself, making use of the unique effects of the Chaffee and innovative and original Digistar programming.
Visiting the Planetarium is a popular activity for students of all ages in Grand Rapids and across Michigan, from preschoolers who learn about the cycles of day and night, to elementary students studying the Solar System and stars, up to high schoolers and even college students focused on the more mysterious wonders of the universe. The Chaffee also draws in visitors to its educational public shows, especially its informal "Under Starlit Skies" descriptive astronomy lectures and spectacular laser light shows.
The Chaffee remains a member of the Great Lakes Planetarium Association, and as of 1995 began hosting conferences on the decennial anniversaries. David L. DeBruyn officially retired after forty years of curatorship in 2003, and still serves in an advisory capacity as a volunteer.
In 2014 the planetarium received a 1.2 million dollar upgrade.

Art d'Ecco is the stage name of a Canadian indie rock singer and musician, based in Victoria, British Columbia. His music has been compared to David Bowie, The Cure, and Sparks.
d'Ecco's birth name is not currently known to the public, but he has revealed that he was born in Ottawa, Ontario and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia. After working as a restaurant line cook in his teens, he began to look into music as a career, playing in the band Speed to Kill with Vancouver musician Jason Corbett.
d'Ecco played in bands for a number of years without seeing much progress. Eventually his father offered to put him up at the family home in the Gulf Islands where he would care for his grandmother, then ailing with Alzheimer's disease. It was during this time of retreat that he wrote the songs that would make up his solo debut as Art d'Ecco, Day Fevers. d'Ecco recorded this album solo with a piano and an iPhone.
After releasing and touring with Day Fevers, d'Ecco began to experiment with his image, inspired by his fascination with artists that "look weird", citing Iggy Pop and Deerhunter. By the time he released his second album, 2018's Trespasser, his first release with Paper Bag Records, he had arrived at his signature look of bob wig and androgynous makeup. His promotion for the album included a set at the 2019 Bumbershoot festival.
In 2021 d'Ecco released his third album, In Standard Definition, which was recorded in analog on a 50-year-old console. It has been described as "a concept album about entertainment." As a follow-up d'Ecco released a cover single of The Jam's "That's Entertainment".

A coxed four, also known as a 4+, is a rowing boat used in the sport of competitive rowing. It is designed for four persons who propel the boat with sweep oars and is steered by a coxswain.
The crew consists of four rowers, each having one oar, and a cox. There are two rowers on the stroke side (rower's right hand side) and two on the bow side (rower's lefthand side). The cox steers the boat using a rudder and may be seated at the stern of the boat where there is a view of the crew or in the bow (known as a bowloader). With a bowloader, amplification is needed to communicate with the crew which is sitting behind, but the cox has a better view of the course and the weight distribution may help the boat go faster. When there is no cox, the boat is referred to as a "coxless four".
Racing boats (often called "shells") are long, narrow, and broadly semi-circular in cross-section in order to reduce drag to a minimum. Originally made from wood, shells are now almost always made from a composite material (usually carbon-fibre reinforced plastic) for strength and weight advantages. Fours have a fin towards the rear, to help prevent roll and yaw and to help the rudder. The riggers are staggered alternately along the boat so that the forces apply asymmetrically to each side of the boat. If the boat is sculled by rowers each with two oars the combination is referred to as a quad scull. In a quad scull the riggers apply forces symmetrically. A sweep oared boat has to be stiffer to handle the unmatched forces, and so requires more bracing, which means it has to be heavier than an equivalent sculling boat. However most rowing clubs cannot afford to have a dedicated large hull with four seats which might be rarely used and instead generally opt for versatility in their fleet by using stronger shells which can be rigged for either as fours or quads.
"Coxed four" is one of the classes recognized by the International Rowing Federation. It was one of the original events in the Olympics but was dropped in 1992.
The world's fastest time in the coxed four has been set by the crew from Germany in the final of the World Championships in Vienna, Austria in 1991. The crew of Matthias Ungemach, Armin Weyrauch, Armin Eichholz, Bahne Rabe and coxswain Jörg Dedering finished in a time of 5:58.96 min.

Eriophorum brachyantherum, the closed-sheath cotton-grass, short-anthered cotton-grass or northland cottonsedge, is a species that is a part of the Cyperaceae or sedge family. It is commonly found in wet areas, such as bogs and cooler climate zones.
Description
Eriophorum brachyantherum is a perennial monocot with 30–60 cm long stems, 1–2 cm flowers, and 2–4 cm fruit. The root balls are very thick with a fibrous root system. The flower is a single, white, cotton ball-like, feathery flower. In the center of the flower there is an oval shaped fruit that contains short anthers. The fruit is an achene that has scales and is surrounded by perianth bristles. The bristles are extended within the fruit and tend to be silky. This plant grows in grass-like environments and blooms during the summer months of June, July, and August.
Distribution
The northland cottonsedge has a circumboreal distribution in North America, Europe, and Asia. In the United States it is primarily occurring in Alaska, though it has been recorded from Idaho and Washington as well. In Canada it occurs natively almost country-wide (AB, BC, MB, NL, NT, NU, ON, QC, SK, YT). It prefers to grow in wet areas, and is commonly found in or near bogs, tundra, muskeg, and fens.
Habitat
Eriophorum brachyantherum can be found in water-saturated substrates with high organic matter content. Damp areas with poor drainage such as wet meadows, tundra landscapes, and flood plains are common occupancy areas for populations of this herb. Muskeg swamps are also common environments where this plant is found because of the heavily saturated soil and high organic matter from partially dead vegetation and mosses that occupy the surrounding area. Northland cottonsedge is seldom seen distant from forest edges.
Reproductive structures
Eriophorum brachyantherum flowers in the summertime. The central flowering stems of this plant are significantly taller than the leaves surrounding them. Both sexes are present on each floret of the terminal spike. There are 3 stamens with the anthers splitting longitudinally and 3 ovary carpels that are syncarpous. Each ovary consists of 3 stigmas and 1 ovule. The seed heads consist of white cotton-like fibers and are dispersed by the wind to spread the seeds.
Uses
The stem and root of this plant were previously used as food by Native Americans, albeit very seldom. The Native Americans would boil the root or simply eat it raw, and for the stem they would store it or fry it in seal oil. The Yupik people used an extract from the leaves as a medical treatment for a variety of gastrointestinal problems.

The 1970 Wyoming gubernatorial election took place on November 3, 1970. Incumbent Republican Governor Stanley Hathaway ran for re-election to a second term. He faced Democratic nominee John J. Rooney, a State Representative and the former Chairman of the Wyoming Democratic Party. Despite Democratic Senator Gale W. McGee's strong performance in the U.S. Senate race, Hathaway's popularity proved an insurmountable obstacle for Rooney to overcome, and the Governor won a second term in a landslide.

Directed by Sony Gaokasak and starring Nirina Zubir and Reza Rahadian, the film is based on the best-selling fiction novel by Tere Liye with the same title. The whole film was shot in Aceh.
Plot
Delisa (Chantiq Schagerl), as a common little girl, had a wonderful life in Lhok Nga, a small village located on the coast of Aceh. She was the youngest daughter of Abi Usman (Reza Rahadian) family, her father served in a tanker ship for an international oil company. Delisa was very close to her mother, who she called Ummi (Nirina Zubir), and her three sisters; Fatima (Ghina Salsabila) and the twins Aisyah (Reska Tania Apriadi) and Zahra (Riska Tania Apriadi).
On December 26, 2004, Delisa with Ummi was getting to the prayer practice exam when suddenly there was an earthquake. Earthquake that was enough to make Delisa's mom and sisters fear. Suddenly the tsunami hit, rolled up their small village, rolled up their schools, and Delisa's little body rolled as well as other hundred thousands in various parts of the coast of Aceh, as well as in Southeast Asia.
Delisa survived and was saved by Smith (Mike Lewis), a U.S. Army soldier who became a volunteer, after several days passed out at a rock. Unfortunately, severe injuries make Delisa's right leg amputated. Delisa's suffering attracted more people compassionately. Smith once wanted to adopt her if she is alone, but Abi Usman succeeded to find Delisa. Delisa happily reunites with his father, although sad to hear that her three sisters has gone, while Ummi's status is unknown.
Delisa rose, amid the grief and loss, in the midst of despair that plagued Abi Usman and other Acehnese people, Delisa has been a little angel who shares laughter at each attendance. Although heavy, Delisa has been taught how grief can be a force to stay afloat. Although it seems did not want the tears stopped flowing, but Delisa trying to understand what it is sincere, doing something without expecting a reply.

Meanwhile, Cullen is tracked by detectives Cicero and Humphries; a hitman known as “Killer” is also hired to kill Cullen.
Cullen locates the second person on his list, Kenneth Tyson, who films his own personal snuff films. After finding and killing Tyson, Cullen gets into a gunfight with Killer in the hallway, but manages to escape. This affects Killer philosophically, and, after proposing to his girlfriend, begins to take the task personally. Humphries and Cicero investigate Cullen's past and discover he was double-crossed during a robbery. Cicero remembers him from a video of his older half-brother Gary's death filmed by Tyson, which depicts an unidentified man shooting Cullen in the head; he narrowly survives, and has a metal plate surgically implanted in his skull.
Cullen visits his former girlfriend, who knows he is killing those involved in the video. After revealing that she aborted their unborn child and has begun a new life, she wishes him well. At a strip club in Nevada Cullen stabs bouncer Hovis Nixon for his role in Gary's death, but he manages to survive. Soon, both Humphries and Killer get word that Nixon is in the hospital. Knowing Cullen will go back to finish him off, they converge there.
Cullen enters the hospital and kills Nixon while he is in surgery. Humphries attempts to unsuccessfully bring down Cullen, but is spared when the latter sees his badge. While driving away from the hospital, Cullen encounters Killer where they get into a high-speed chase on the freeway, culminating in Killer shooting Cullen in the neck.
Eventually Cullen comes to believe that his father arranged to have him and Gary killed after they refused to share the money they stole in a bank robbery. However, Cullen finds out that his father died years before, and realises that it was Gary's girlfriend who sold them out. The last man on his list is a traveling evangelist named Alexander Jerrod; after concluding his service, he is confronted by Cullen, but is spared after revealing that he has turned his life around and begging for forgiveness. Cullen is then confronted by Killer.
Cicero eventually learns the true identity of the man who shot Cullen, and she hurries to the church where Humphries is already on the scene. As Killer and Cullen confront each other, Humphries walks in and shoots Cullen in the head, revealing it was he who shot him in the video. He offers Killer the money for the job, but Killer declines, telling Humphries to never contact him again.
Humphries calls his wife, who is revealed to have been his informant while she was still Gary's girlfriend. Suddenly, he is shot and killed by Cullen, who survived due to his metal plate. Cicero arrives on the scene after Cullen leaves, and she covers up Humphries' involvement.
Cullen scatters Gary's ashes in the sea and drives off into the sunset, while Killer returns home to his wife; simultaneously, Jerrod begins a sermon on forgiveness.

Production
Variety reported in May 2009 that Dwayne Johnson was in final negotiations for his role and that Phil Joanou would be directing. That September it was reported that Joanou had dropped out and George Tillman Jr. would direct. Salma Hayek was considered for the role of Cicero, but a week before filming was started she dropped out due to "scheduling issues". Hayek was replaced by Carla Gugino. Principal photography began on February 8, 2010, in Los Angeles, California and continued in Pasadena and Santa Clarita in California.
Chevelle
The Chevrolet Chevelle driven by "Driver" which is prominently displayed in the movie has the rear of a 1971 or 1972 model, but the front of a 1970 model presumably due to the rarity and value of the 1970 Chevelle SS 454 which the car in the film is presumably portraying (it is never actually specified).
Soundtrack
Additionally, another song used for the film include "En mi viejo San Juan" (Spanish for, "In my old San Juan") composed and sung by Mexican singer and actor, Javier Solís.
Release
The film grossed $12,200,000 over the five-day Thanksgiving release. It stayed in theaters until February 10, 2011. The film ultimately grossed $35,626,958 worldwide. The film was produced on a $24 million budget. It was released on video on March 1, 2011, and it grossed another $17.3 million in DVD and Blu-ray sales in the US.
Reception
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 42% of 130 critics have given the film a positive review; the rating average is 4.87 out of 10. The site's consensus reads: "It's good to see Dwayne Johnson back in full-throttle action mode, but Faster doesn't deliver enough of the high-octane thrills promised by its title." It holds a Metacritic score of 44 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
Roger Ebert for the Chicago Sun-Times said, "Rotate the plot, change the period, spruce up the dialogue, and this could have been a hard boiled 1940s noir. But it doesn't pause for fine touches and efficiently delivers action for an audience that likes one-course meals".

Johnstone Bennett (1870 – April 14, 1906) was an American actress and vaudeville performer.
Early life
Walenton (or Valentine) Cronise was possibly born in France, or Spain, or at sea (sources tell various stories), and was adopted as an infant by Mrs. Mary Bennett in the United States. When Bennett died, she was adopted again, by actress Sibyl Johnstone. She called herself "Johnstone Bennett" after the two women who raised her.
Career
Johnstone Bennett was with a small touring company when she was discovered by Richard Mansfield and cast in Monsieur (1887) in Madison Square Theatre. Still with Mansfield's company, she appeared in Prince Karl (1887), Lesbia (1888), A Parisian Romance (1888), and Beau Brummell (1890). She also appeared in Honor Bright (1888), All the Comforts of a Home, A Noble Son (1889), The Story of Rodion (1895), and in starring roles of Jane (1891), The Amazon, Fanny, and A Female Drummer (1898). In vaudeville she performed in sketched titled A Quiet Evening at Home and American Types.
Bennett wore masculine clothing and short hair, both on and off the stage. She collected cuff buttons and shirt studs, and had her skirts made with trouser-style pockets. She hired a male valet instead of a maid or press agent, and she lent her name to a haberdashery company in New York. In 1899 she caught a mouse in her dressing room, and planned to keep it for a pet.
Novelist Willa Cather described her as "jovial, natty Johnnie Bennett, a hail-fellow-well-met, and the trimmest tailor-made New Woman of them all. She is another one who has learned how to cheat time: her cheeks are just as ruddy and her big gray eyes as frank and frolicsome and boyish as they were in the days of Jane, eight or nine years ago." Theatrical manager Robert Grau remembered Bennett as "distinctly without an equal in her time."
Personal life
Johnstone Bennett was destitute in her last years and survived with assistance from the Actors' Fund. She tried moving to California for her health, but it did not improve and she returned to New Jersey. She died from tuberculosis in 1906, aged 36 years, in Bloomfield, New Jersey.

Alonzo Clifton McClennan (May 1, 1855 - April 14, 1912) was an African-American doctor who was the co-founder of the Charleston Hospital and Training School for Nurses in Charleston, South Carolina, established to provide for the education of black nurses, care of black patients, and hospital privileges for black doctors. It opened in 1897. McClennan had gone to medical school after being the second African American appointed as a midshipman to the United States Naval Academy. He resigned in order to go directly into medicine. Graduating with medical and pharmacy degrees, he married and settled in Charleston, South Carolina, where he set up his medical practice.
Early life and education
McClennan was born in Columbia, South Carolina on 1 May 1855. Orphaned when young by his mother's death, he was raised after the Civil War by his uncle, Edward B. Thompson, a free black barber. He began his higher education at the Benedict Institute in Columbia. He was later appointed as a legislative page in the South Carolina state legislature with the help of another uncle, Samuel B. Thompson, a Republican representative.
McClennan was appointed to the United States Naval Academy in 1873, but resigned four months later. He studied at the Wesleyan Academy in Massachusetts and the University of South Carolina before graduation. He moved to Washington, DC to attend the Howard University College of Medicine, a historically black college. He graduated in 1880 with honors, and degrees in medicine and pharmacy. He returned to the South and initially established a practice in Augusta, Georgia. In 1884 McClennan moved to Charleston, South Carolina.
Naval Academy and early African-American midshipmen
McClennan had met Richard H. Cain when Cain was a South Carolina State Senator and they became friends. After Cain was elected as United States Representative for South Carolina's at-large district, he resolved to make appointments to the service academies. His office conducted a competitive examination in the summer of 1873. While McClennan had long hoped to become a physician, his family's inability to afford college made an appointment to military college a promising stepping-stone. After intense preparation, McClennan placed second in the examination and accepted an appointment to the United States Naval Academy.
McClennan was aware that the first black midshipman, James H. Conyers, had complained of suffering racism at the academy. He did not encounter any racism during the Academy entrance examination. But McClennan was of mixed race, with a predominately European appearance: he had blond hair, blue eyes and "was to all appearances a white man". Because of this, he was not visibly classified as black and did not encounter as much racism as did some African Americans.
The year after McClennan's resignation, Henry E. Baker was appointed to the Academy and also faced hazing. Baker was dismissed from the Academy in Fall 1875 for using "opprobrious language" during a mess hall fight. He was reinstated by Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson, but racial harassment continued. Baker resigned permanently. After southern states disenfranchised most blacks at the turn of the century, closing out most blacks from federal, state and local elective offices, no other blacks were appointed to the Naval Academy for the following six decades.
Medical career
Four years after graduation from medical school, McClennan moved to Charleston, South Carolina, where he established his practice and gained an "excellent reputation as a physician". In 1892 he opened Charleston's first black drug store, the People's Pharmacy, which became a success. In 1896 McClennan and all but one of Charleston's black physicians lobbied for a hospital to serve Charleston's black population and provide the doctors with otherwise unobtainable hospital privileges. Led by Dr. Lucy Hughes Brown, the training of black nurses began that year with theoretical lectures held in the auditorium of Wallingford Academy; attempts to hold practical training at the City Hospital and Old Folks Home were rebuffed.
The Hospital and Training School for Nurses was chartered by the South Carolina legislature in July 1897, and opened with 24 beds in a three-story building purchased for $4,500 (equivalent to $ in present-day terms). Funds for the purchase of the building and necessary equipment were secured almost entirely by local charity, including support from the Duke Endowment. A historical marker commemorating McClennan and the hospital was erected in 2010 near 135 Cannon Street in Charleston.
Personal life
McClennan married Ida Veronica Ridley, a schoolteacher from a prominent African-American family in Augusta, Georgia. Their home in Charleston became a locus of social life for black elites in the city, and they frequently hosted recitals, literary gatherings, and other social functions. The couple had three children: Maude (1885‒1976), Harriet (b. 1890), and Ridley Ulysses (1887–1921).
Dr. McClennan died in Charleston on 14 April 1912. He is buried in the Humane and Friendly Society Cemetery in Charleston.

Poul M. Volther (2 January 1923 – 23 January 2001) was a Danish furniture designer who is remembered above all for his iconic Corona Chair. He succeeded Børge Mogensen as artistic director of FDB Møbler in 1950.
Early life
First trained as a cabinetmaker, Volther studied furniture design at the Arts and Crafts School in Copenhagen. A believer in Functionalism, he avoided short-lived aesthetic trends, concentrating on the simple crafting of quality materials. As a teacher at Denmark's Design School, he encouraged hundreds of students to aim for high quality craftsmanship. With the support of designer Hans Wegner, he was employed from 1949 by the cooperative FDB Møbler, working in their design studio under the leadship of Børge Mogensen. Mogensen left FDB in 1950, leaving Volther in charge from 1950-55. He went on to design a series of Windsor chairs, rather simpler in style than Mogensen's own. He also designed a wide variety of armchairs and sofas which can still be seen in homes throughout Denmark and are still in production.
Developing the Corona Chair
His early chair designs were based on a series of cushions separated by open spaces in order to economize on materials which were difficult to obtain after the Second World War. The first model, the Pyramid Chair from 1953, with foam and cloth elements, was far from successful. But the same basic approach eventually led to his masterpiece, the Corona Chair, first designed in 1961. The original consisted of a wooden skeleton on which a series of oval cushions provided the seat and the rising back. The idea was that it would allow the body to relax in various positions. The following year, as the result of cooperation between Volther and the recently established Erik Jørgensen furniture factory, a new model with a chrome-plated steel frame was marketed in 1964. But it was still far from successful.
Some 20 years later, yet another variant was presented at the furniture fair in Cologne, receiving a good press but not selling too well. Nevertheless, Erik Jørgensen's firm persisted. In 1997, the chair was presented both at the Cologne fair and at the Scandinavian Furniture Fair at the Bella Center in Copenhagen. This time it was a resounding success. The Corona was used at the 2002 EU Summit in Copenhagen, the year after Volther died. Today, with its elliptical, blow-up cushions, it has reached iconic status, becoming Jørgensen's most successful item, with sales of almost 3,000 a year.

The Jackson County Courthouse, also known as Old Jackson County Courthouse or Bellevue Elementary School, is a historic building and former courthouse for Jackson County, Iowa, United States. It is located in Bellevue and was built in the vernacular Greek Revival style in 1845. It currently serves as a portion of Bellevue Elementary School, the oldest functioning school in the state of Iowa.
History
When the Wisconsin Territory created Jackson, Jones, and Linn counties in 1837, Bellevue was named as the seat of justice for all three. Stock thief and counterfeiter W.W. Brown doctored a legitimate petition to have himself named as the organizing sheriff of Jackson County. The position went to Captain W.A. Warren instead.
Completed in 1845, this building is one of the oldest structures in Iowa used as a courthouse after Lee (1841) and Van Buren (1843) counties. It is also one of seven extant courthouse buildings in the Greek Revival style in the state. This building was a victim of the county seat rivalry that moved the Jackson County seat between Bellevue (1838–48), Andrew (1848-51), Bellevue again (1851–61), Andrew once more (1861-73), finally ending up in Maquoketa in 1873.
The courthouse was converted fully to use as a school in 1861, it is the pre-kindergarten through fifth grade Bellevue Elementary School in the Bellevue Community School District serving over 350 students. The original building has since been surrounded by additions. The south wing was added in 1870 and the north wing was added in 1872. A gymnasium and cafeteria were completed in the 1950s, and two 2-story classroom wings in the 1960s and 1970s. Previously, the courthouse was in a park-like, town square setting, but has since been paved with asphalt with trees removed. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 2, 1981.
Architecture
The Old Jackson County Courthouse is a two-story, brick, vernacular Greek Revival structure. It takes the form of a traditional Greek temple without a portico. Unadorned, 2-story wings flank the main façade to the north and south. The building is capped with a hip roof with one gable. On the roof above the arched main entrance once stood a large cupola featuring a cloister vault shaped roof and large bell. The cupola was removed sometime during the mid 20th century due to deterioration and leaks in the roof. Other decorative elements of the building include a classical pediment with a returned cornice and half-moon window as well as simple brick projecting pilasters on all three sides of the main façade. Native limestone gathered from local quarries make up the exposed rough cut foundation, window sills, lintels, and front steps. Although the interior was altered drastically numerous times throughout the past 175 years to accommodate changing education practices and modern amenities, it still retains tin ceilings (mostly covered by dropped ceilings), much of its original woodwork (although heavily painted and damaged), and its grand stairway with large wooden newel posts. Other antique features include original schoolhouse style glass light fixtures from the early 1900s, cast iron radiators, and some original window panes.
Future
Discussion began in 2017 to determine the future of the building. The community rejected a $16 million bond referendum that would have funded construction of a new elementary school in a field west of town on September 11, 2018, with 44% of voters approving the measure (short of the 60% supermajority required for approval). The district reduced the proposed building's square footage from 69,000 sq. ft. to 56,000 sq. ft. and voted on a $14.5 million referendum on April 2, 2019. The referendum was again rejected by the community with only 46% voter approval. Despite the community repeatedly voicing their desire to keep and maintain the historic building and campus, the school administration has continued to ignore the value of having a monument to our living cultural heritage at the center of town, and is continuing efforts to abandon the historic property.

Geopyxis carbonaria is a species of fungus in the genus Geopyxis, family Pyronemataceae. First described to science in 1805, and given its current name in 1889, the species is commonly known as the charcoal loving elf-cup, dwarf acorn cup, stalked bonfire cup, or pixie cup. The small, goblet-shaped fruitbodies of the fungus are reddish-brown with a whitish fringe and measure up to across. They have a short, tapered stalk. Fruitbodies are commonly found on soil where brush has recently been burned, sometimes in great numbers. The fungus is distributed throughout many temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is found in Europe, Turkey, and North America. Although it is primarily a saprotrophic species, feeding on the decomposing organic matter remaining after a fire, it also forms biotrophic associations with the roots of Norway spruce.
Taxonomy
The fungus was first described scientifically in 1805 by Johannes Baptista von Albertini and Lewis David de Schweinitz as Peziza carbonaria. Mordecai Cubitt Cooke illustrated the fruitbodies, spores, and asci in his 1879 work Mycographia, seu Icones fungorum. Figures of fungi from all parts of the world. In 1889, Pier Andrea Saccardo transferred the fungus to the genus Geopyxis, giving the species its current name. Pustularia carbonaria, published by Heinrich Rehm in 1884, is a synonym of G. carbonaria. Louis-Joseph Grélet proposed the variety Geopyxis carbonaria var. sessilis in 1937, referring to forms producing fruitbodies without a stalk, but the taxon is not considered to have independent taxonomic significance. In 1860 Miles Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis described the species Peziza lepida from collections made in Japan as part of the North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition (1853–1856). This taxon was synonymized with G. carbonaria by Mien Rifai in 1968, a taxonomic opinion corroborated by Donald Pfister about a decade later.
The specific epithet carbonaria derives from the Latin word for "charcoal". Common names given to the fungus include "charcoal loving elf-cup", "dwarf acorn cup", "pixie cup", and the British Mycological Society approved "stalked bonfire cup".
Description
The fruitbodies (ascocarps) of Geopyxis carbonaris are cup shaped, 1–2 cm wide, and have fringed whitish margins. The inner spore-bearing surface of the cup, the hymenium, is brick red and smooth, while the exterior surface is a dull yellow, and may be either smooth or have blister-like spots (pustules). The stipe, if present, is small (1–1.5 mm long and 1–2 mm wide), whitish in color, and expands abruptly into the cup. The brownish flesh of the fungus is thin and brittle. It does not have any distinctive taste, but has an unpleasant smell when crushed in water. It is inedible, with the fruitbodies being insubstantial anyway.
Microscopic characteristics
In mass, the spores are whitish. The spores are elliptical, smooth, hyaline, devoid of oil droplets (eguttulate), and have dimensions of 13–18 by 7–9 µm. They are thin walled and germinate and grow rapidly in vitro in the absence of external stimuli. The asci are 190–225 by 9–10 µm. The paraphyses are slightly club-shaped, unbranched, and have irregular orange-brown granules, with tips up to 5 µm wide, and are not forked or lobed. The hypothecium, the layer of cells below the hymenium, is made of densely packed, small irregular cells.
Similar species
The closely related vulcan elf cup (Geopyxis vulcanalis) has a pale orange to yellowish fruitbody that is deeply cup shaped before flattening in maturity, and its crushed flesh often has an odor of sulfur. It may be distinguished microscopically by its paraphyses, which lack the orange-brown granules characteristic of G. carbonaria. It also has larger spores, measuring 14–22 by 8–11 µm. Unlike G. carbonaria, it grows on substrates other than burned wood, including mosses, and needle duff. Tarzetta cupularis, which grows habitats similar to G. carbonaria, is distinguished microscopically by its spores that contain two oil droplets. Tarzetta catinus is also similar. Other genera with similar species with which G. carbonaria may be confused in the field include Aleuria, Caloscypha, Melastiza, and Sowerbyella.
Habitat and distribution
Geopyxis carbonaria is widespread on burned soil or charcoal in the spring and throughout the growing season. It is one of the most common pioneer species found on burned ground. The charred litter on the forest floor increases the underlying soil pH as well as the availability of minerals. Fruitbodies are produced from 16 to 139 weeks after a forest fire in areas with coniferous trees. Most fruitbodies are produced in the first year after a burn. The fungus prefers fruiting in microhabitats with thin postfire duff near standing burned tree trunks. Geopyxis carbonaria fruitbodies are often found in the same post-fire stands as morels, although the former is usually more abundant. Because the pixie cup fruits earlier than morels, it may serve as an indicator of imminent morel fruiting. Other cup fungi often found fruiting in the same area as G. carbonaria include those from the genera Aleuria, Anthracobia, Peziza, and Tarzetta.
The fungus is found in Europe (from where it was originally described), and is widespread throughout North America. The North American distribution extends north to Alaska. In 2010, it was reported for the first time from Turkey.
Ecology
Although primarily a saprotrophic fungus involved in the post-fire breakdown of duff and coniferous roots, Geopyxis carbonaria has been shown to be capable of forming ectomycorrhizae with Norway spruce (Picea abies). It had been demonstrated earlier in laboratory experiments that the fungus has a biotrophic interaction with lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). The hyphae of G. carbonaria were able to infect the cortex of the tree seedling, but did not penetrate the endodermis. These traits suggest that the fungus is a moderate pathogen, with limited ability to cause reductions in seed germination. Additionally, the fungus produces the enzyme polyphenol oxidase, and can break down the complex organic polymer lignin—features characteristic of saprotrophic fungi. The formation of a rudimentary Hartig net, a characteristic of mycorrhizal fungi, indicated that G. carbonaria might be capable of forming mutualistic relationships under the right conditions. Vrålstad and colleagues suggest that its below-ground association with spruce roots protects it from physical damage in the event of a fire, and the extensive fruitbody production after a fire may reflect "a successful fungal escape from a dying host where the fungus no longer can maintain its biotrophic association".
Large fruitings of the fungus are often associated with damage to the host tree, such as that which occurs with burning. A field study conducted in Norway demonstrated that fruit bodies were more likely to be found in areas that were heavily burned, compared to locations with light to moderate burning where the trees remained viable, or in clearcut areas. Fruiting was much denser in spruce forests—with up to 700–1000 fruitbodies per square meter—than in pine forests, where fruitbodies were sporadic. Fruitbodies grew by the millions in the year following the Yellowstone fires of 1988.

The grey-breasted woodpecker (Melanerpes hypopolius) is a species of bird in the family Picidae. It is endemic to the interior of southwestern Mexico.
Distribution and habitat
Areas of domain in Mexico include Guerrero, Morelos, and Puebla. Knowledge of the behavior of this bird was widely unknown before a 1990 study out of the Cooper Ornithological Society which observed six of the birds. The study confirmed the communal roosting habits of the birds, specifically on cacti. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical high-altitude shrubland.
Description
Like Gila woodpecker (male has round red crown patch), but pale red on cheek; short black line over eye; much darker and grayer below and on head. It is also similar to the zebra-backed birds of the same genus.
Population
The population is slightly less than 50,000 in its native Mexico, classifying it as a species of the least concern for extinction.
Eating habits
Its food source is the fruit of the cactus, similar to that of the grey fox, cactus wren, house finch and lesser long-nosed bat, but cactus fruit is not its only main food source, groups of 3-10 forage for various insects of the region, like cicadas and termites, and sometimes, they even catch flies. The birds work together to scan for food, and they do so in an amiable fashion, never showing outward aggression for food.
Fledglings
The grey-breasted woodpecker behave slightly differently to some other species in their genus, Melanerpes. They don't beg for their parent's attention or for food, but this observable behavior only references when they are not hidden. Fledglings spend most of their time hidden inside cacti, and outwardly do not appear to eat often. The plumage of a fledging differs from that of the adult, featuring darker necks and breasts, and the red crown patch is significantly darker than adults, enough that it is noticeable.
Vocalization
David observed three types of vocalization from the grey-breasted woodpecker, including a loud and aggressive sounding rattle, a "chuck" sound by females when the observer approached nests, and a "yak" sound with a heavy inflection.

Kabir Kuh (; Kurdish: کڤەر -Kiver) is one of the long ranges of the Zagros Mountains near the border of Lurestan and Ilam Provinces in Ilam province, Iran. Covering an area of , Kabir Kuh stretches in length and in width along the Zagros Mountains in the Northwest-Southeast direction. It begins about south of Ilam and stretches down to the vicinity of Andimeshk in Khuzestan. Made mainly by Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, the Kabir Kuh range consists of a large number of mountains, including Shah Ahmad, Tabriz, Kaleh-bad, Filman, Damaghey-e Anar, Rivasan, Puneh, Sabzkhani, Zarrin, Golgol that are covered by snow and ice all year round. Its highest peak is Kan Seifi with elevation, south-east of Ilam. Kabir Kuh runs along the Seymareh river, which becomes Karkheh when joins the Kashkan river before reaching the border of Ilam province and Khuzestan province. Kabir Kuh divides the mountainous region in western Iran into two regions generally referred as Piškuh (eastern side) and Poštkuh (western side), the latter virtually coinciding with Ilam.
The eastern side is dominated by steep slopes where water and wooded valleys abound. The western side is, however, quite dry but rich in oil reservoirs and underground resources.

Jonathan Gressel (born October 30, 1936 in Cleveland, Ohio) is an Israeli agricultural scientist and Professor Emeritus at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. Gressel is a "strong proponent of using modern genetic techniques to improve agriculture" especially in third world and developing countries such as Africa. In 2010, Gressel received Israel's highest civilian award, the Israel Prize, for his work in agriculture
Early life
Jonathan Ben Gressel were born on October 30, 1936 in Cleveland, Ohio, USA and immigrated to Israel with his family, making aliyah in 1950 at the age of 14.
Education
Gressel completed his secondary education at Pardes Hanna Agricultural High School in Israel in 1955. He returned to the United States, where he earned his B.Sc. in Plant Sciences at Ohio State University. He then attended the University of Wisconsin where he obtained his master's degree in Botany (Plant Physiology) in 1957, working with Folke K. Skoog, and his Ph.D. degree in 1962 working with LeRoy G. Holm, Eldon H. Newcomb, and R. H. Burris.
Career
Gressel joined the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, in 1962, working in the biochemistry department. In 1963 he moved to the Plant Genetics Department (later the Department of Plant and Environmental Science.)
For a number of years, he held the Gilbert de Botton Chair of Plant Sciences.
As of 2005, he became a professor emeritus at the Weizmann Institute.
Gressel has edited several journals, including Plant Science and others in this field. He has taught classes on transgenic biosafety for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).
Gressel belongs to the American Society of Plant Biologists, the International Weed Science Society, and Sigma Xi.
He is an Honorary member of the Weed Science Society of America. He served as president of the International Weed Science Society from 1997-1999.
In 2008 Jonathan Gressel co-founded the company TransAlgae.
Research
Two-thirds of the food eaten by the human population comes from just four main plant species: wheat, rice, maize, and soybeans.
Historically, reliance on genetically uniform crops has put the human population at risk for catastrophic crop failures such as the European Potato Failure and the Great Famine of Ireland.
Throughout the twentieth century, plant breeding has focused on increasing agricultural productivity, while pesticides and herbicides have been widely used to increase yields. Concerns have arisen about reliance on chemical means of weed control, and the ability of pests and weeds to develop resistance to pesticides and herbicides.
Jonathan Gressel and Lee Segel developed the first simulation model for the development of resistance to herbicides, later modifying and expanding it. Their models have been widely used to predict and study the possible evolution of herbicide resistance.
In 1982, Gressel and Homer LeBaron edited the first book to be published on Herbicide Resistance in Plants.
Gressel and Segel's earliest models are relatively simple, and tend to predict pessimistic outcomes for the evolution and management of resistance. Their later models are more complex and suggest a variety of options for managing herbicide resistance.
In 1991, Gressel reported a number of characteristics that tend to be associated with plants that develop herbicide resistance:
1) Herbaceous annuals
2) Self-fertile
3) Found in agricultural habitats
4) Colonisers
5) High reproductive capacity
6) Complex genetic variability (polymorphic phenotypes)
Assuming that a heritable variation of a trait occurs in a population, the rate at which it evolves will depend on the mode of inheritance of the traits, and intensity of selection in the population. The rate at which naturally resistant individuals occur in a population varies with plant species. Persistent applications of herbicides can result in recurrent selection, resulting in a shift in the average fitness in the population due to herbicide exposure. Resistant individuals in a population will produce seed for the next generation, while non-resistant individuals do not live to do so. Selection pressure will drive the proportion of resistant individuals in the next generation upward. The rate at which herbicide resistance appears in a weed population will depend on factors such as the initial frequency of resistant individuals, how many individuals in a population are treated, the mode of inheritance of the gene or genes involved, and the nature and extent of herbicide use.
Gressel has extensively studied weed control practices, with particular attention to developing countries where farmers may not have the resources to buy and use expensive herbicides.
Herbicide rotation is one type of management practice that may slow the evolution of herbicide-resistant plants.
In Molecular biology of weed control (2002) Gressel also reviews possible approaches such as the development of plant species that can produce their own weed-killing allelochemicals and
the development of insects and plant pathogens that can act as biological control agents by targeting herbicide-resistant weeds.
In recent years, Gressel has focused on control options for the root parasitic weedsOrobanche (broomrape)
and Striga (witchweed). These weeds are particularly important in the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa, where they can cause farmers to lose half their potential yield and cause long-term environmental damage. Gressel has developed herbicide-resistant maize seeds coated in pesticide, which are now commercially available in Kenya and Uganda.
Gressel is also known for inventing the biobarcode. He has proposed the creation of a universal public repository to track ‘biobarcoded' biological materials. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) based techniques would be used to create, assign and identify nucleotide sequences that can be recognized by universal primers.
There are a variety of reasons to use biobarcodes, including protection of patented organisms, detection of transgenics, and tracking of the dispersal of genetic materials. Gressel suggests that such a system would have benefits to industry, regulators and taxpayers.
Another area of Gressels's research concerns the evolution of volunteers (plants that germinate in later years, after a crop has been harvested) and feral plants (derived from crops that have become de-domesticated). Understanding processes in the domestication and de-domestication of crops is particularly important as scientists develop and commercialize transgenic crops. In 2005, Gressel edited Crop ferality and volunteerism, the first book published on the topic.
In 2008, Gressel published Genetic Glass Ceilings: Transgenics for Crop Biodiversity, a careful, detailed, and passionate examination of the possible application of plant sciences such as molecular biology and transgenics to worldwide agricultural policies. He discusses the limitations and possible genetic modification of fourteen underutilised crops. He describes ways in which plant sciences could be used to expand biodiversity, address agricultural problems, and protect the environment.
In 2008 Jonathan Gressel co-founded TransAlgae, with his son, Noam Gressel and others. His goal was to develop genetically modified algae for growth in customized indoor and outdoor reactors that would be resistant to colonization and take-over by other types of algae and bacteria. The genetically designed algae, along with its optimal medium and growing system, could be specialized for a particular partner. To address limitations in water availability, the systems are designed to work with either fresh water or seawater. In the event of an accidental release, the algae were designed to die within a few hours, to prevent their escape into the wild. Possible applications of specialized algae include feedstocks for biofuels,
animal feed, and drug delivery.
Gressel has applied for or received at least 21 patents.
Awards
2010, Gressel received Israel's highest civilian award, the Israel Prize in the category of Agriculture for "breakthrough studies in the molecular mechanisms that allow the extermination of weeds in agriculture."
2008, Outstanding International Achievement award, International Weed Science Society
2007, Honorary Award, Weed Science Society of Israel
1992, Honorary Fellow, Weed Science Society of America
1979, Cohen Award in Plant Protection, Israel Agricultural Research Organization, for work on cellular and mathematical models for studying herbicide effects (with Dr. S. Zilkah)
1967, Sarah Leedy Award for Outstanding Young Scientist, Weizmann Institute of Science
Publications
Gressel has published more than 300 peer reviewed journal articles and book chapters, and eight books. His Herbicide resistance in plants (1982) and Crop ferality and volunteerism (2005) are the first books on those topics.

Wake Up Everybody is an album released by Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes on the Philadelphia International record label in November 1975. It was produced by Kenneth Gamble & Leon Huff. This would be the last album to include Teddy Pendergrass before he left the group for a solo career.
The album features the hit singles "Wake Up Everybody" and "Tell the World How I Feel About 'Cha Baby". "Don't Leave Me This Way", which would be reinterpreted two years later by Thelma Houston, was a hit on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at #5. The lead vocal on the closing album track, "Searching for a Love", was performed virtually solo by Sharon Paige, who also performed duet duties with Pendergrass and Melvin on the song "You Know How to Make Me Feel So Good."
The album was remastered and reissued with a bonus track, a Tom Moulton remixed version of "Don't Leave Me This Way", in 2008 by Legacy Recordings.

Orai is a city in Uttar Pradesh, India. It is the administrative headquarters of Jalaun District. All administrative offices of Jalaun District, including the District Collectorate, police, telecom and various other government organizations are located in this city. Orai received the award of 'Fastest Mover' Small City among India (0.8-3.1 Lakh) under Swachh Survekshan 2019, an annual cleanliness survey carried by the Quality Council of India.
History and historical importance of Orai
Orai was named after Saint Uddalak because he worshiped there. The city has historical value because of its location, which is between Jhansi, Mahoba and Kalpi.
Alha and Udal of the Banaphar clan were legendary generals of the Chandela king Paramardi, who fought Prithviraj Chauhan in 1182 CE.
The town of Kalpi on the Yamuna was conquered by the armies of Muhammad of Ghor in 1196. Early in the 14th century the Bundelas occupied the greater part of Jalaun, and even succeeded in holding the fortified post of Kalpi. During 1553–56, the Hindu Prime Minister and Chief of Army of Suri empire Hemu won this area. Later, on 7 October 1556, he was coronated Emperor of northern India at Delhi. He established Hindu Raj in northern India and acquired the title of Vikramaditya. After Hem Chandra Vikramaditya's death at the second battle of Panipat, this important possession was soon recovered by Akbar's army, and passed under the way of the Mughal Empire. Akbar's governors at Kalpi maintained a nominal authority over the surrounding district, and the Bundela chiefs were in a state of chronic revolt, which culminated in the war of independence under Maharaja Chhatrasal. During the outbreak of his rebellion in 1671 he occupied a large province to the south of the Yamuna. Setting out from this base, and assisted by the Marathas, he conquered the whole of Bundelkhand. On his death in 1732 he bequeathed one-third of his dominions to his Maratha allies, who before long succeeded in annexing the whole of Bundelkhand. Under Maratha rule, the country was a prey to constant anarchy and strife. In 1806 Kalpi was turned over to the British, and in 1840, on the death of Nana Gobind Ras, his possessions lapsed to them also. Various interchanges of territory took place, and in 1856 the boundaries of the British district were substantially settled, with an area of 1477 square miles.
Orai, Jalaun was the scene of much violence during the Revolt of 1857. When the news of the rising at Kanpur reached Kalpi, the men of the 53rd Native Infantry deserted their officers, and in June the Jhansi rebels reached the district and began their murder of Europeans. It was not until September 1858 that the rebels were finally defeated. In the later 19th century, the district suffered much from the invasive kans grass (Saccharumspontaneum). Many villages were abandoned, their land no longer suitable for cultivation. The population of the district was 399,726 in 1901, and the two largest towns were Konch and Kalpi (pop. 10,139 in 1901). The district was traversed by the line of the Indian Midland railway from Jhansi to Kanpur. A small part of it is watered by the Bethwa Canal. Grain, oil-seeds, cotton and ghee were exported.
Orai participated in the freedom struggle under the leadership of Bundelkhand Kesri Dewan Shatrughan Singh and Rani Rajendra Kumari, the founders of the freedom movement in Bundelkhand. Their ancestral fort in Mangrauth is on one side of the river Betwa; the other side of the Betwa is Jalaun, where Orai is located.
After 1990
Orai has changed after 1990. Major changes came because of the industrial area, HUL (Hindustan Unilever LTD) and many others. After 1990, schools, colleges, roads and many more were built.
Climate
Orai has a composite climate, with high temperatures in summer and low in winter. Relative humidity remains about 40-50%. The climate of the Orai district is characterized by a hot summer and general dryness, except for rainfall during the southwest monsoon season. The year has four seasons. The cold season lasts from December to February; January's minimum temperature is 7.1 C. The hot season is from March until the first week of June. May is the hottest month of the year with an average temperature of 42.1 C. The southwest monsoon runs from the middle of June until the end of September. October and middle of November constitute the post-monsoon or retreating monsoon season. The normal annual rainfall of Orai is 793.8 mm. About 90.4% of annual rainfall is received during monsoon season; only 9.6% of annual rainfall takes place between October to May. The humidity is lowest in April and varies between 26% and 83% throughout the year.
Demographics
According to the Orai City Census data from 2011, the literacy rate was 82.35 percent.
Overview
The city of Orai is governed by the Municipal Corporation, which comes under Orai Metropolitan Region. The city is located in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. The total area of Orai Is 20.86 km2.
The population of Orai in 2016 was 217,389, of which males and females comprised 111,987 and 105,402 respectively.
In 2011, there were 880 females for every 1000 males. The ratio for children was 845 girls for every 1000 boys.
Children numbered 31,011 in Orai in 2016. There were 17,859 boys and 13,152 girls. Children form 7.01% of the total population of the city.
Ramkund Park
Ramkund Park is a recreational place with a paved walkway around a small water pond. Locals visit the park for their morning walk. It is located near Thadeshwari Maharaj Mandir (Sri Hanuman Mandir) and every year on "Budhwa Mangal", a large crowd from surrounding villages gathers for festivals of prayer for Lord Hanumana.
Radha Krishna Mandir
"Shri Radha Krishna Mandir" is a sacred temple located in Galla Mandi.
Transport
Railway
Orai railway station is the main railway station, sitting between the Kanpur-Jhansi section and a well connected with the east, west & southern parts of India via rail.
The existing railway line, (North Central Railway), runs from Jhansi to Kanpur. It has been electrified, and a doubling of the track is in progress. Orai's railway station is categorized as a "model railway station".
Many trains such as the Jhansi-Lucknow Intercity Express, Lucknow-Mumbai AC Express, Gwalior-Barauni Mail, Kushinagar Express, Sabarmati Express, Pratham Swatantrata Sangram Express and many more trains have a departure in Orai.
Airports
Kanpur Airport, located in Chakeri near Kanpur, is the nearest airport. Flights to Delhi and Varanasi are operational from the airport. The nearest international airport is at Lucknow, which is about 200 kilometers away. The government has proposed setting up an international airport near Kanpur in the Kanpur dehat district, which would be in close proximity to the town. Gwalior Airport is 156 km from Orai by road.

Ḥeḥ (ḥḥ, also Huh, Hah, Hauh, Huah, and Hehu) was the personification of infinity or eternity in the Ogdoad in ancient Egyptian religion. His name originally meant "flood", referring to the watery chaos that the Egyptians believed existed before the creation of the world. The Egyptians envisioned this chaos as infinite, in contrast with the finite created world, so Heh personified this aspect of the primordial waters. Heh's female counterpart was known as Hauhet, which is simply the feminine form of his name.
Like the other concepts in the Ogdoad, his male form was often depicted as a frog, or a frog-headed human, and his female form as a snake or snake-headed human. The frog head symbolised fertility, creation, and regeneration, and was also possessed by the other Ogdoad males Kek, Amun, and Nun. The other common representation depicts him crouching, holding a palm stem in each hand (or just one), sometimes with a palm stem in his hair, as palm stems represented long life to the Egyptians, the years being represented by notches on it. Depictions of this form also had a shen ring at the base of each palm stem, which represented infinity. Depictions of Heh were also used in hieroglyphs to represent one million, which was essentially considered equivalent to infinity in Ancient Egyptian mathematics. Thus this deity is also known as the "god of millions of years".
Origins and mythology
The primary meaning of the Egyptian word ḥeḥ was "a million" or "millions"; a personification of this concept, Ḥeḥ, was adopted as the Egyptian god of infinity. With his female counterpart Ḥauḥet (or Ḥeḥut), Ḥeḥ represented one of the four god-goddess pairs comprising the Ogdoad, a pantheon of eight primeval deities whose worship was centred at Hermopolis Magna.
The mythology of the Ogdoad describes its eight members, Heh and Hauhet, Nu and Naunet, Amun and Amaunet, and Kuk and Kauket, coming together in the cataclysmic event that gives rise to the sun (and its deific personification, Atum).
Forms and iconography
The god Ḥeḥ was usually depicted anthropomorphically, as in the hieroglyphic character, as a male figure with divine beard and lappet wig. Normally kneeling (one knee raised), sometimes in a basket—the sign for "all", the god typically holds in each hand a notched palm branch (palm rib). (These were employed in the temples for ceremonial time-keeping, which use explains the use of the palm branch as the hieroglyphic symbol for rnp.t, "year"). Occasionally, an additional palm branch is worn on the god's head.
In Ancient Egyptian Numerology, Gods such as Heh were used to represent numbers in a decimal point system. Particularly, the number 1,000,000 is depicted in the hieroglyph of Heh, who is in his normal seated position.
Cult and worship
The personified, somewhat abstract god of eternity Ḥeḥ possessed no known cult centre or sanctuary; rather, his veneration revolved around symbolism and personal belief. The god's image and its iconographic elements reflected the wish for millions of years of life or rule; as such, the figure of Ḥeḥ finds frequent representation in amulets, prestige items and royal iconography from the late Old Kingdom period onwards. Heh became associated with the King and his quest for longevity. For instance, he appears on the tomb of King Tutankhamen, in two cartouches, where he is crowned with a winged scarab beetle, symbolizing existence and a sun disk. The placement of Heh in relation to King Tutankhamen's corpse means he will be granting him these "millions of years" into the afterlife.

Étienne Laurent Pierre Burnel (22 May 1762 in Rennes – 12 July 1835 in Rennes) was a French colonial administrator.
Life
Born into a middle-class family, Burnel studied at the Jesuit college in Rennes - his father Pierre-Étienne Burnel was a magistrate who spent much of his career in Guyana. Aged 18, Burnel joined the régiment de Béarn, in which he spent several years under the command of the chevalier de Payan, working as his secretary.
On 16 November 1790, he moved to île de France to seek his fortune. On 1 January 1791 he founded the Le Journal politique et littéraire, editing it for 18 months. At the end of 1791, one year after arriving, he joined the bar at Port-Louis. Becoming a public personality and general correspondent and 'avocat d'affaires' to the colonial assembly at Pondicherry, he then became a member of the local directory in 1794.
In March 1794, he chartered a ship under an American flag on a commercial operation and sailed on her himself. Despite the USA still being neutral in the French Revolutionary Wars, it was captured by the British and declared a legitimate prize, ruining Burnel. Dropped off at an American port, he took the chance to visit Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Alexandria, meeting several French émigrés, including Talleyrand. It was in New York that Burnel learned of 9 Thermidor.
Back in France, in 1795 the French Directory put Burnel in command of a mission to Belgium. In 1796 he and René Gaston Baco de La Chapelle were sent to the îles de France and La Réunion as government agents charged with abolishing slavery. Arriving at Port-Louis on 18 June 1796, they were both expelled by the colonists, who had decided to resist the abolition.
In 1798, the government sent him to Guyana to replace Nicolas Georges Jeannet-Oudin, nephew of Danton. Signed by the minister for the navy Bruix, his orders gave him wide autonomy. Arriving at Cayenne in October, he had to face the landowners' hostility to the central government and to the large number of men deported, victims of the Thermidorian reaction (Billaud-Varenne) and the coup of 18 Fructidor (general Pichegru, Tronsson-Ducoudray, Laffon-Ladebat, Barbé-Marbois and Job Aymé). Barbé-Marbois attacked him in letters to his close friends in France, published 36 years later under the title Journal d'un déporté.
After 18 months as governor, he successfully requested a recall to France on health grounds. Arriving back in France after Napoleon's coup of 18 brumaire, he retired to private life. When Napoleon set up prefectures in 1800, some friends wished to put Burnel's name forward, but Burnel remained faithful to the Republic and opposed them. It was only during the French military disasters of 1812 and 1813 that he offered his services to Napoleon. He was rewarded with a pension of 6,000 francs. Denounced as a "former terrorist", a "septembriseur" and secretary to "Robespierre", he was convoked by the marquis de Vioménil, commander of the 13th military division, to whom he could demonstrate that the accusations were unfounded. He saw the ant de la 13th division militaire, auquel il n'a aucun mal à démontrer l'inanité de ces accusations. He lived to see the July Revolution of 1830, before dying in Rennes in 1835.

Tibo InShape, whose real name is Thibaud Delapart (born 19 January 1992, in Toulouse), is a French YouTuber.
Known for his YouTube videos, this popular influencer was specialized in the field of bodybuilding. He subsequently diversified his videos, including a series of videos about discovering lesser-known jobs.
He also sparked a controversy about racist and homophobic Facebook posts.
Biography
As a student at Toulouse Business School, Thibaud Delapart started publishing bodybuilding videos on the YouTube platform under the pseudonym Tibo InShape during his final year of study. His audience exploded when he added humor to his bodybuilding and nutrition advice. He has built his renown thanks to social media and quickly got millions of subscribers, turning him into a sports star. His colloquial expressions such as "Daaamn!" at the beginning of his videos or "énorme et sec" (which means, huge and ripped) have become familiar YouTube-related expressions. In 2015, his success on the internet allowed him to launch an online clothing brand. As a bodybuilder, he confessed his exercise addiction in one of his videos. Bound by a contract to YouTube, he was nominated by the magazine Libération as one of the ten most influential French accounts in 2016.
He made most of his early videos in his room with a friend, but his fame now enables him to film in different places and to organize meetings with several personalities such as Christophe Lemaitre, Maïva Hamadouche or Esteban Ocon. In December 2017, the program Quotidien named him "Youtuber of the year 2017". His videos were then receiving an average of a million views each. He opened a weight room in September 2017. In 2018, he filmed two videos in the Albi maison d'arrêt (a category of prisons in French-speaking countries, similar to county jails in the United States), then three discovery videos about the Institut de recherche criminelle de la Gendarmerie nationale (the forensic science department of the French National Gendarmerie).
After stopping his bodybuilding videos, Thibaud Delapart has gone into the discovery of different lifestyles as well as popular or lesser-known occupations. His video published on March 20, 2019, was dedicated to the occupation of embalming, a video which has been the subject of much debate on the part of his subscriber community.
Between 2017 and 2019, he produced many institutional communication videos promoting the French Army, the French Navy, police, penitentiary administration, and also the Service national universel (General National Service), an indirect successor of military conscription. Those videos, totaling up to 4.5 million views (in July 2019), were claimed by Slate to have received between €20,000 and €30,000 in government funding.
Controversy
Several posts that Tibo InShape published between 2009 and 2012 on Facebook under his real name Thibaud Delapart have been accused of racism, homophobia, Islamophobia and xenophobia and resurfaced on Jeuxvideo.com in 2015: "What is the point of spawning a massive population when we perfectly well know that we won't be able to treat or educate it, and that it will only be able to grow by parasitizing all other species?" (April 2009), "Toulouse and its cultural diversity ..." (November 2009), "I'm having fun throwing pork chops at Muslims, that's cool, they burn" (January 2012), "A black reelected, the homosexual marriage adopted. This is not going to be an easy day" (November 2012).
In 2018, he accused "a guy who photoshopped my last name" of creating fake posts. However, he gave a different version of events the following year, saying his account had been hacked in 2013. The last of the four polemical messages was verified with records available in the Wayback Machine.

The Latécoère 631 was a civil transatlantic flying boat built by Latécoère, the largest ever built up to its time. The type was not a success, being unreliable and uneconomic to operate. Five of the eleven aircraft built were written off in accidents and one was lost during World War II.
Design and development
The Latécoère 631 was the result of a specification issued in 1936 by the Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile for a 40-passenger airliner with a range of . The aircraft was ordered in 1938. It was intended that it would be powered by six Gnome et Rhône P.18 engines of each. A competitor for this specification was the SNCASE SE.200 Amphitrite.
Construction of the aircraft was stopped due to the outbreak of World War II and was not resumed until after the signing of the Franco-German Armistice. The prototype, registered F-BAHG, first flew on 4 November 1942. It was subsequently confiscated by the Germans, and passed to the Luftwaffe, who allocated the codes 61+11. The aircraft was flown to Lake Constance, where it was destroyed in an attack by two Royal Air Force de Havilland Mosquito aircraft on 17 April 1944. SNCASE SE.200 Amphitrite 20+01 was destroyed in the same attack.
History
The second aircraft, F-BANT, first flew on 7 March 1945. It was powered by six Wright Cyclone engines of each. Four aircraft were purchased by Air France, and entered service on the Biscarrosse-Port-Étienne-Fort de France route in July 1947. The aircraft were withdrawn from service in August 1948 following the loss of F-BDRC. SEMAF operated two aircraft until 1950, when the survivor was withdrawn following the loss of F-BANU. The Société France Hydro operated one aircraft until it was lost on 10 September 1955. This was the last flying aircraft, with the remaining four survivors being scrapped. The Latécoère 631 was not a success due to it being unreliable and uneconomic to operate.
Accidents and incidents
31 October 1945 An Air France Latécoère 631 (F-BANT) was operating a flight from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Montevideo, Uruguay, and Buenos Aires, Argentina, when the propeller of No. 3 engine separated in flight and debris struck the No. 2 engine. A propeller blade sliced a hole in the cabin, killing two passengers. A small fire started and an emergency landing was made in the Laguna de Rocha, Uruguay. The aircraft was subsequently repaired and returned to service. The celebrated poet, diplomat and composer Vinicius de Moraes and writer Rubem Braga, both Brazilians, were on board.
21 February 1948 A Latécoère 631 (F-BDRD) was on a delivery flight from Saint-Malo, Ille-et-Vilaine, to Biscarrosse, Landes when it crashed into the English Channel off Saint-Marcouf, Manche, in a snowstorm with the loss of all nineteen people on board.
1 August 1948 Air France Flight 072 (F-BDRC) ditched in the Atlantic Ocean for reasons unknown with the loss of all 52 people on board. The aircraft was operating a flight from Fort-de-France, Martinique, to Port-Étienne (now Nouadhibou), Mauritania. Following this loss, the Latécoère 631 was withdrawn from service by Air France. The United States Coast Guard ship reported finding debris on August 4 but no sign of survivors.
28 March 1950 A SEMAF Latécoère 631 (F-WANU) crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off Cap Ferret, Gironde, after the aileron control couplings failed due to severe vibration in one of the engines gearboxes with the loss of all twelve people on board. The aircraft was on a test flight from Biscarrosse to determine the cause of the crash of Air France Flight 072.
10 September 1955 A France-Hydro Latécoère 631 (F-BDRE) suffered wing separation (probably due to windshear) after flying into a tropical storm and crashed 38 mi north of Banyo, French Cameroon, killing all 16 on board. The aircraft was on a flight from Lac Lérè, Chad, to Douala, French Cameroon (now Cameroon), en route to Biscarrosse for maintenance.

Macclesfield District General Hospital is a health facility in Macclesfield, Cheshire. It is managed by the East Cheshire NHS Trust.
History
The hospital has its origins in the Macclesfield Workhouse and Hospital which opened at West Park in 1844. A fever hospital was completed in 1854 and a new hospital block was completed in 1881. It became West Park Hospital in 1930 and joined the National Health Service as Macclesfield Hospital, West Park Branch in 1948.
Meanwhile the Macclesfield Infirmary, which had been built at Cumberland Street in 1868, evolved to join the National Health Service as Macclesfield Hospital, Infirmary Branch in 1948. The Infirmary Branch moved to Prestbury Road in 1980.
The operation of the hospital became very inefficient as clinical operations were split between the West Park Branch and the Infirmary Branch. Accordingly the hospital was re-built as Macclesfield District General Hospital at West Park in the early 1980s.
The sustainability and transformation plan for Merseyside and Cheshire proposed to downgrade the emergency department at Macclesfield District General Hospital to a minor injuries and illnesses unit, but within a fortnight, after widespread opposition it was altered to read "The clear view is that the best model of care will include an A&E department at Macclesfield staffed by hospital doctors and clinicians."
At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in England the maternity services was closed and staff and patients sent to acute sites in Greater Manchester.

Matthew Gillette Robinson (born June 28, 1955) is a former professional American football player, a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) from 1977–1982 for the New York Jets, Denver Broncos, and Buffalo Bills. He was later with the Jacksonville Bulls and Portland Breakers of the United States Football League (USFL) in 1984 and 1985, respectively.
College
Robinson played college football at the University of Georgia under head coach Vince Dooley. His sophomore season in 1974 was his first as a starter and he led the Bulldogs to a 6–6 record. He threw for 8 touchdown passes and 10 interceptions. The Bulldogs improved the next season though Robinson's stats went down. The Bulldogs finished 9–3 and ranked 19th in the AP poll. The following season, Robinson's senior year, the Bulldogs finished in the top ten and were 10–2 overall, after losing the Sugar Bowl. When his college career concluded, Robinson finished with more interceptions (20) than touchdown passes (17).
Pro career
Despite Georgia being a run-oriented team, Robinson was selected by the New York Jets in the ninth round of the 1977 NFL Draft. With Richard Todd viewed as the quarterback of the future, Robinson was considered a "camp arm," a quarterback drafted only to get repetitions in practice so the incumbent starter doesn't get overworked in the preseason. Robinson defied the odds and made the team, and even got a start his rookie season, against the Seattle Seahawks in week nine, but the Jets were shut out 17–0.
Four games into the 1978 season, the Jets at 2–2, Todd was injured, and Robinson was pressed into service as the starter. The Jets lost his first start, but then won their next three and looked like a contender in the AFC East. Robinson made some big plays along the way, including a 75-yard strike to Wesley Walker to upset the defending AFC champion Denver Broncos 31–28 in week ten. Robinson's steady play along with an improved defense helped the Jets finish 8–8, a marked improvement over 1977's 4–12. For the year, Robinson passed for 2,002 yards and 13 TD's with 16 INT's. For the 1979 season, Todd was re-instated as the starter and Robinson stayed as backup for one more year before being traded to the Broncos in exchange for a second and first round pick and back-up quarterback Craig Penrose.
In 1980, Robinson started the first seven games for the Broncos over veteran Craig Morton. During that time, the Broncos went 4–3. Robinson only spent one season in Denver, moving on to Buffalo to serve as the understudy to Joe Ferguson. Robinson then joined the Jacksonville Bulls of the USFL. His time in Jacksonville ended when the Bulls acquired Brian Sipe. Robinson then moved on to the Portland Breakers and finished his career there. In 1985, his final season as a pro, he split time with Doug Woodward, a quarterback out of tiny Pace College, as the Breakers were struggling to find a new quarterback after starter Johnnie Walton retired. The Breakers failed to generate much of an offense and finished 6–12 and missed the postseason.
In his final season, Robinson completed 156 passes on 310 attempts and threw 15 touchdowns and 20 interceptions for 2,182 yards.
Post NFL career
Robinson remains active with the NFLPA, helping players who have recently retired making the transition from being a professional athlete to the next chapter of their lives.

The Lloyd Arabella was a passenger car produced by the Borgward Group in West Germany between 1959 and 1961. After the company's controversial bankruptcy the Arabella continued to be produced, albeit in greatly reduced quantities and branded as the Borgward Arabella until 1963. By the standards of the time and place it would have been defined as a small family car.
The Arabella was the first (and as matters turned out the last) car from Borgward's Lloyd division to be fitted with a four-cylinder engine.
Body and chassis
The Arabella was a completely new design, owing nothing to the Lloyd Alexander which it initially complemented and then replaced in the manufacturer's range. It was developed in just 23 months, which later commentators have asserted was much too short a period in which to identify and eliminate "teething-troubles" ahead of launch. It was constructed using a frame of tube-steel with cross-members.
The front wheels were suspended with double-wishbone connectors with coil springs and telescopic shock absorbers, and the back wheels on trailing arms with coil springs with and anti-roll bar. The brakes, considered advanced at the time, were applied using a hydraulic linkage, with four light-alloy 200 mm brake drums. The hand brake was operated mechanically and worked on the rear wheels. Almost as innovative at the time was the specification of Tubeless tyres on the 13" wheels. The rack and pinion steering required 3.36 between opposite locks, and the turning circle was .
The all-steel body followed modern styling trends, and featured a "panoramic wrap-around" rear window and tail fins. There was space for four people, although the two in the back would have found their headroom rather restricted. The sales material of the time makes much of the car's passive safety features, such as the two spoke steering wheel with a recessed central hub, rounded door handles and a lock on the front seat-backs to prevent them from tilting forwards unexpectedly. The padded dashboard and interior window frames were also unusual, and the claim can certainly be made that in terms of secondary safety (US English: "crashworthiness") the Lloyd Arabella marked a step forward for cars of this class. The spare wheel was stowed below the rear luggage compartment. It was stowed externally which meant it could be accessed without having to empty out the luggage locker.
Engine and transmission
It was originally planned to power the Arabella with an uprated version of the two cylinder four-stroke power unit used in the existing Lloyd Alexander, together with a suitably uprated gear box from the same car. However, testing of a chassis equipped with this combination indicated that would not all fit under the bonnet of the body, which by that stage had been finalised, so a four cylinder Boxer motor was hastily developed. The flat configuration of the boxer motor made it suitable for the low bonnet line of the stylish bodywork, but accommodating it in the available space remained a challenge and the cooling fan had to be squeezed in above the two cylinders on the left side of the engine bay. Unlike the smaller existing Lloyd models, the Arabella used water to cool its engine. The gear box was positioned ahead of the front axle and ahead of the engine, as on the manufacturer's smaller cars, but it had to be redesigned in order to fit beyond the engine in the relatively short engine bay. There was talk of installing the engine transversely, possibly in order to avoid having to redesign the gearbox to make it fit, but in the event the Arabella featured a longitudinally mounted Boxer motor.
Broadening the range
Downmarket
On its introduction in August 1959 the Arabella featured a 4-cylinder 897 cc with a stated output of 38 PS (28 kW) at 4,800 rpm. During 1960 it was necessary to impose a major price increase, and in order to soften the blow a reduced specification cut-price Arabella was launched in July 1960, still with the 897 cc engine, but now in a detuned form offering a maximum power output of only 34 PS (25 kW) at 4,700 rpm.
Upmarket
In October 1960 a de luxe version of the Arabella was added to the range. As far as the technical specifications were concerned, the Arabella de Luxe was differentiated from the standard model by its engine. It was still a 4-cylinder 897 cc unit, but maximum power was increased to 45 PS (33 kW) at 5,300 rpm. This was achieved by increasing the compression ratio from 1:7½ on the standard model to 1:9. That in turn meant that drivers had to pay a little more for their fuel, because the higher compression ratio necessitated the use of the "super" grade (high octane) petrol (gasoline) which was beginning to become available at West German service stations. The other important difference was the fitting of a larger Solex carburetor (34 PCI in place of the 28 mm carburetor used for the standard cars). The result was a useful improvement in performance, with the top speed increased from 120 km/h to 133 km/h (from 75 mph to 83 mph), while the standing start time to 100 km/h was reduced from 28 to 23 seconds. The Arabella de luxe was in these respects significantly brisker than more expensive (albeit larger and heavier) cars such as the Ford Taunus or, more importantly, the class-defining Volkswagen with its advertised top speed, in 1960, of only 112 km/h (70 mph) and leisurely standing start time to 100 km/h of 38 seconds.
From the outside the Arabella de Luxe was differentiated by a revised radiator grille, featuring the traditional Borgward "rhombus" shape at its centre, and the name "Borgward" was written on the front of the car in place of the name "Lloyd", even though sources state that the car was only formally rebranded as the "Borgward Arabella" in 1961. It is possible that the need to clear unsold stocks of new cars meant that any announcement of a rebranding was deferred so that the cars identified with the "Lloyd" name on the front could be sold (as new cars) first.
Arabella coupé
The Lloyd Sportcoupé is generally identified, in retrospect, as a coupé version of the Lloyd Arabella. In fact the Sportcoupé, with a stylish body produced by Pietro Frua of Turin, made its debut at the Turin Motor Show in November 1958. At that stage it was powered by the 596 cc two stroke engines from the Lloyd Alexander TS, but the DM 6,000 asking price combined with the "rustic" sound and performance from the power unit made the car unsellable. However, by this time the manufacturer had given Frua firm orders for 50 of the coupé bodies, and so the stylish little Sportcoupé reappeared at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 1959, now as a coupé version of the Arabella. By the time the cars were actually disposed of they were powered by the 45 PS (33 kW) "high compression engine" version of the Arabella.
Commercial
The Arabella was developed in just 23 months. There was a price to be paid for the rushed development schedule in terms of a large number of niggling faults and one or two more serious ones. The passenger cabin leaked on rainy days. The pattern of a pleasingly eye-catching modern inherently robust new model from Borgward marred by "teething troubles" affecting the early cars was a familiar one for Borgward buyers through the 1950s, but by 1959 waiting lists were down and the West German car market had become far less forgiving. Early teething troubles caused massive damage to the image of the Lloyd Arabella, and large numbers of unsold Arabellas began to fill the undeveloped land beside the factory where the cars were assembled.
Considerable amounts of cash had been invested in the Arabella's development, including investment in a new assembly plant. Recovery of those costs from the sale of new cars necessitated a minimum level of sales, which the various technical niggles made unachievable in the marketplace. The car had been launched with a sticker price of DM 5,250. Less than a year later, in June 1960, the price was raised to DM 5,490, while the introduction of a cut-price reduced-performance version nevertheless enabled the manufacturer to advertise a "starting price" for the reduced-performance Arabella of DM 4,985. Meanwhile the West German small car market was increasingly dominated by Volkswagen. Volkswagen achieved sales volumes that more than covered necessary investment in upgrades for a car of which the basic architecture had not changed in more than ten years. The sticker price for a standard Volkswagen had been reduced in August 1955 to DM 3,790, where it stayed till September 1961 when it increased to DM 3,810. Pricing strategy for the Arabella was reversed in November 1960 with a price cut for the standard model to DM 5,230. This coincided with the introduction of the more powerful de Luxe version, however, which was priced at DM 5,730.
Information on sales volumes is unavailable, but production figures are known. Between 1959 and 1963 47,042 Arabellas were produced, of which nearly 70% were produced during 1960. Following the company's bankruptcy in 1961, the Arabella was the only model that continued in production for another couple of years, with the plant now rented from its new owner, and 893 Arabellas produced in 1963 by a group of former employees who had acquired the necessary rights during the liquidation process. Nevertheless, the size of the investment in developing and preparing to produce the Arabella, couple with the failure to sell it in sufficient quantities to recover the investment within a reasonable period, were a major contributor to the company's bankruptcy in 1961.
Meanwhile, following the appearance of two show cars at the September 1959 motor show, the fifty Frua Sportcoupé bodies were mated with to the underpinnings of the Arabella and offered for sale, now at a price of DM 7,500. Despite the improved performance characteristics available from the larger engine, there was no market for a miniature Sportcoupé Arabella in Germany, and while the two cars that had appeared at Frankfurt turned up again at several subsequent European motor shows, the rest of the cars were eventually earmarked for export. Most of them ended up on the USA where they were used to grabbing attention in show rooms, and some of them found buyers as stylish second cars for the wives and daughters of one or two affluent buyers.

Renato Petit de Ory, better known by its French name, René Petit (8 October 1899 – 14 October 1989) was a Franco-Spanish engineer, known for being a footballer in his youth. He was one of the most popular players in Spanish football in the 1910s, 1920s and 1930s, playing for Real Madrid and Real Unión, and becoming a member of the French national team. He represented France at the 1920 Summer Olympics.
Biography
Renato or René Petit lived his life traveling between Spain and France. The son of a French engineer who held the post of head of traffic at the Company of Railways in Northern Spain. His mother was Spanish, more specifically born in Madrid.
Born in Dax, France – which may be considered as a coincidence, since his mother had traveled to that town for treatments at the thermal waters – his childhood was spent in the Basque Country, between the towns of Irun and Hondarribia, the former town being the terminus of the Spanish rail network, where his father worked. Petit lived in a wealthy family and had a thorough education of the French type. At 12, he moved to live in Madrid, where he attended high school at the Colegio El Pilar.
Football career
Petit never considered himself a striker, but a player who provided passing and support. He could play center forward but most of his career he played as a midfielder. Many consider that Petit modernized Spanish football, by establishing passing and team play against the previously existing anarchy.
Madrid FC
At the El Pilar college, Petit started out playing as a centre forward; from there he went to Real Madrid C.F.'s reserve team. At the age of 14, he debuted with the first team.
Rene and his elder brother, Juan Petit, made themselves noticed during the 1914–15 season at Madrid. At that time, Rene was 15 years old. Petit became one of the stars of Real Madrid in the 1910s, being slim and powerful, he can be considered the first player of the modern era because of its ability to interpret the game.
With Petit in the first team, Madrid reached the final of the Spanish Cup on two occasions, in 1916 and 1917, winning the title on the latter occasion. The 1917 final against Arenas de Getxo marked the consecration of the 17-year-old Petit; an individual piece of brilliance from René, dribbling past all who came in front of him, allowed Madrid to equalize in the 75th minute, thus forcing extra-time in which Ricardo Álvarez scored the winner. His older brother didn't play in the match, since shortly before the final he was drafted into the French army. He was severely injured in World War I and this put an end to his playing career prematurely.
Petit's career at Madrid is summarized in 29 games and 13 goals, a Spanish Cup, and two regional championships.
Real Unión
Petit, rather than remain connected to Real Madrid, preferred to continue playing football for the team of his hometown, the Real Unión de Irún, which he joined in 1917. He played a vital role in helping his new side reach the 1918 Copa del Rey Final, where he contributed to the defeat of his former team, Madrid, and thus winning his second Cup title. In 1924 he won yet another Copa del Rey defeating Real Madrid again in the 1924 final thanks to a lonely goal from José Echeveste.
International career
Being an Madrid FC player, he was eligible to play for the Madrid national team, being in the line-up of the team's first-ever international match on 10 May 1915 against Catalonia, which was held at the Campo de O'Donnell for the 1915 Prince of Asturias Cup, the first edition of the Prince of Asturias Cup, and although they lost 1-2, Petit scored the consolation goal, thus being the author of the first goal in the history of the team. In the decisive game against a Basque XI, he missed a penalty in a eventual 1-1 draw that was enough for the Basques to win the cup.
When he joined Real Unión, he become eligible to play for the Gipuzkoa national team, and he was part of the squad that participated in two editions of the Prince of Asturias Cup, in 1922-23 and 1923-24, with both campaigns finishing in a quarter-final exit at the hands of Catalonia, losing 0-3 and 1-2 respectively, with the author of their only goal in the competition being René Petit.
He also represented France at the 1920 Summer Olympics, playing two games and scoring none.

"Come On Mess Me Up" is a song by Australian alt-pop group Cub Sport, released in August 2016 as the third and final single from the group's debut studio album This Is Our Vice. The song was certified platinum in Australia in February 2020.
Lead singer Tim Nelson said "My dad has a book of Leonard Cohen lyrics that I was reading [and] it inspired me to be more honest and genuine with my writing. "Come On Mess Me Up" sounds a bit like a desperate love ballad; I guess it kind of is a desperate love ballad about my relationship with music. I wrote it about how I want to keep doing this even if it messes me up a bit along the way — pursuing music can be pretty rough mentally and physically. The verses more or less follow my journey from when I first started writing/recording songs when I was working on Sparkes St, to when I went to uni to study dentistry then un-enrolled three years in so I could pursue music. The third verse references when we were touring overseas and I got really sick — that's what 'throwing up real hard' line is about. This song is one of my favourites on the album."
"Come On Mess Me Up", reached number 24 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2016.
Music video
The music video was released on 19 May 2016. It was directed and edited by Joe Agius and sees Nelson crooning to the camera while smearing layer upon layer of green-screened paint on his face, creating a deeply creepy effect of multiple faces contending with each other to occupy the same space. The compelling clip showcases a rare air of vulnerability in a stark departure from the indie-pop band's more playful previous work.

The Bezirksliga Bayern was the highest association football league in the German state of Bavaria from 1923 to 1933. The league was disbanded with the rise of the Nazis to power in 1933.
Overview
The league was formed in 1923, after a league reform which was decided upon in Darmstadt, Hesse.
Until the introduction of the Bezirksliga, the Kreisliga Südbayern and Kreisliga Nordbayern were the highest leagues in the state.
The league started out with eight clubs from all over the state of Bavaria, but without any teams from the Palatinate region (German:Pfalz), then politically a part of Bavaria but not geographically connected to the rest of the state. The eight clubs played each other in a home-and-away round with the two top teams advancing to the Southern German championship, which in turn was a qualification tournament for the German championship.
In its second season, the league started to incooperate clubs from the city of Ulm, Württemberg, which lays right across the border from Bavaria. Otherwise, the modus of the league remained unchanged but only the league champion qualified for the Southern German finals in this season.
For the 1926–27 season, the league was expanded to ten teams. The top team was again qualified for the finals. Additionally, the SpVgg Fürth as Southern German cup winner also qualified for this round. The runners-up of the Bezirksligas in the south also played a championship round to determine a third team from the region to go to the German finals.
After this season, the league was split into a northern and a southern group, the north having nine and the south seven teams. The winner of each division would advance to the Southern German finals while the two runners-up again played in a separate round like in the previous season.
The 1928–29 season saw no change in modus but both leagues now operated on a strength of eight clubs. The qualification system for the finals also remained unchanged. This system remained in place until 1931.
For the 1931–32 season, both divisions were expanded to ten teams. The top-two teams from each league then advanced to the Southern German finals, which were now staged in two regional groups with a finals game between the two group winners at the end. The same system applied for the final season of the league in 1932–33.
With the rise of the Nazis to power, the Gauligas were introduced as the highest football leagues in Germany. In Bavaria, the Gauliga Bayern replaced the Bezirksliga Bayern as the highest level of play. The twelve best teams from Bavaria qualified for this new, statewide league.

The long tailpipe is an argument stating that usage of electric vehicles does not always result in fewer emissions (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions) compared to those from non-electric vehicles. While the argument acknowledges that plug-in electric vehicles operating in all-electric mode have no greenhouse gas emissions from the onboard source of power, it claims that these emissions are shifted from the vehicle tailpipe to the location of the electrical generation plants. From the point of view of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the actual carbon footprint depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation, as well as the impact of additional electricity demand on the phase-out of fossil fuel power plants.
Description
Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) operating in all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power but emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants. From the point of view of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the actual carbon footprint depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles and higher than hybrid electric vehicles.
Because plug-in electric vehicles do not produce emissions at the point of operation are often perceived as being environmentally friendlier than vehicles driven through internal combustion. Assessing the validity of that perception is difficult due to the greenhouse gases generated by the power plants that provide the electricity to charge the vehicles' batteries. For example, the New York Times reported that a Nissan Leaf driving in Los Angeles would have the same environmental impact as a gasoline-powered car with compared to the same trip in Denver would only have the equivalent of . The U.S. Department of Energy published a concise description of the problem: "Electric vehicles (EVs) themselves emit no greenhouse gases (GHGs), but substantial emissions can be produced 'upstream' at the electric power plant."
A recent study by the German IfW shows that the increased electricity demand, and the resulting delay in the shutdown of coal-fired power plants in Germany, causes electric vehicles to have 73% higher emissions than Diesel vehicles.
Carbon footprint in selected countries
A study published in the UK in April 2013 assessed the carbon footprint of plug-in electric vehicles in 20 countries. As a baseline the analysis established that manufacturing emissions account for 70 g CO2/km. The study found that in countries with coal-intensive generation, PEVs are no different from conventional petrol-powered vehicles. Among these countries are China, Indonesia, Australia, South Africa and India. A pure electric car in India generates emissions comparable to a petrol car. The country ranking was led by Paraguay, where all electricity is produced from hydropower, and Iceland, where electricity production relies on renewable power, mainly hydro and geothermal power. Resulting carbon emissions from an electric car in both countries are 70 g CO2/km, which is equivalent to a petrol car, and correspond to manufacturing emissions. Next in the ranking are other countries with similar low carbon electricity generation, including Sweden (mostly hydro and nuclear power ), Brazil (mainly hydropower) and France (predominantly nuclear power). Countries ranking in the middle include Japan, Germany, the UK and the United States.
The following table shows the emission intensity estimated in the study for each of the 20 countries, and the corresponding emissions equivalent in miles per US gallon of a petrol-powered car:
Carbon footprint in the United States
In the case of the United States, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) conducted a study in 2012 to assess average greenhouse gas emissions resulting from charging plug-in car batteries from the perspective of the full life-cycle (well-to-wheel analysis) and according to fuel and technology used to generate electric power by region. The study used the Nissan Leaf all-electric car to establish the analysis baseline, and electric-utility emissions are based on EPA's 2007 estimates. The UCS study expressed the results in terms of miles per gallon instead of the conventional unit of grams of greenhouse gases or carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per year in order to make the results more friendly for consumers. The study found that in areas where electricity is generated from natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric or renewable sources, the potential of plug-in electric cars to reduce greenhouse emissions is significant. On the other hand, in regions where a high proportion of power is generated from coal, hybrid electric cars produce less CO2 equivalent emissions than plug-in electric cars, and the best fuel efficient gasoline-powered subcompact car produces slightly fewer emissions than a PEV. In the worst-case scenario, the study estimated that for a region where all energy is generated from coal, a plug-in electric car would emit greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to a gasoline car rated at a combined city/highway driving fuel economy of . In contrast, in a region that is completely reliant on natural gas, the PEV would be equivalent to a gasoline-powered car rated at.
The following table shows a representative sample of cities within each of the three categories of emissions intensity used in the UCS study, showing the corresponding miles per gallon equivalent for each city as compared to the greenhouse gas emissions of a gasoline-powered car:
An analysis of EPA power plant data from 2016 showed improvement in mpg-equivalent ratings of electric cars for nearly all regions, with a national weighted average of 80 mpg for electric vehicles. The regions with the highest ratings include upstate New York, New England, and California at over 100 mpg, while only Oahu, Wisconsin, and part of Illinois and Missouri are below 40 mpg, though still higher than nearly all gasoline cars.
Criticism
The long tailpipe has been the target of criticism, ranging from claims that many estimates are methodologically flawed to estimates that state that electricity generation in the United States will become less carbon-intensive over time. Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk published his own criticism of the long tailpipe.
The extraction and refining of carbon based fuels and its distribution is in itself an energy intensive industry contributing to CO2 emissions. In 2007 U.S. refineries consumed 39353 million kWh, 70769 million lbs of steam and 697593 million cubic feet of Natural Gas. And the refining energy efficiency for gasoline is estimated to be, at best, 87.7%.

Dairy Farmers of America Inc. (DFA) is a national milk marketing cooperative in the United States. DFA markets members' raw milk and sells milk and derivative products (dairy products, food components, ingredients and shelf-stable dairy products) to wholesale buyers both domestically and abroad. Net sales in 2016 were $13.5 billion, representing about 22 percent of raw milk production in the United States.
History
DFA was formed in 1998 through the merger of four dairy cooperatives: the Southern region of Associated Milk Producers Inc.; Mid-America Dairymen Inc.; Milk Marketing Inc.; and Western Dairymen Cooperative Inc. Officials from the four cooperatives determined that merging would give the nation's dairy farmers a fair voice in national policymaking and the ability to address the needs of national customers. Since then, five other cooperatives have become a part of DFA – Independent Cooperative Milk Producers Association, Valley of Virginia Milk Producers Association, California Cooperative Creamery, Black Hills Milk Producers and Dairylea Cooperative Inc. Its headquarters from 1998 until 2017 was near Kansas City International Airport in Kansas City, Missouri.
In 2011, DFA acquired Kemps of St. Paul, Minnesota, and its subsidiaries from HP Hood. In 2014, DFA acquired Oakhurst, and Dairylea Cooperative Inc. merged with the farmer-owned Cooperative. DFA became the sole owner of DairiConcepts in 2015, which was once a partnership between DFA and Fonterra Co-operative Group Unlimited. DFA also acquired Cumberland Dairy, a processor of ultra-pasteurized dairy products, in 2017.
In February 2020 Dairy Farmers of America agreed to buy a “substantial” part of Dean Foods, the largest U.S. milk producer, for $433 million, the company said. As part of the deal, Dairy Farmers of America, an agricultural cooperative that represents roughly 14,000 dairy producers, would acquire 44 of Dean's plants. In May 2020 that deal was finalized and the acquisition was completed.

The red-headed trogon (Harpactes erythrocephalus) is a species of bird in the family Trogonidae.
Etymology
H. erythrocephalus comes from the Ancient Greek terms ἐρυθρός eruthros meaning red and κεφαλή, kephalē meaning head.
Description
The red-headed trogon is on average in length. The male has a red head and breast, a unique feature in the Trogon group. The female resembles the Diard's trogon without a speckled undertail.
The head, neck and upper breast of an adult male is dull crimson. A narrow white band crosses the mid breast, underneath which the lower breast to abdomen is light red to pink. Pale red can be observed on the flanks whereas the mantle and back of the bird are rusty brown. The male perches on branches with the support of mauve-blue legs. Regarding wing colouration, the lesser and median wing coverts, secondary coverts, as well as outer webs of tertials and secondaries are vermiculated black and white. The primary feathers also appear black and white. As for the bird's long tail, the central feathers are dark brown with a black tip, the second and third pairs are black and the outer pairs are white with black bases. Finally, a black-tipped cobalt blue bill, a deep mauve-blue gape and eyering and reddish-brown irises shape the bird's face.
The head, neck and upper breast of an adult female are olive-brown. Just like the male, a narrow white band crosses the mid breast, underneath which the lower breast to abdomen is light red to pink. The mantle and back appear orange to brown in colour. The wings are vermiculated dark brown and yellowish brown. The tail feathers are very similar to those of the males. The bill, gape and bare eyering are pale blue on females.
At the juvenile stage, the head, neck and upper-parts are buff brown, whereas the underparts appear buff white. No black tip on the narrower central tail feathers can be observed.

Taxonomy
Trogon erythrocephalus was the scientific name proposed by John Gould in 1834 for a red-headed trogon specimen from Yangon in Myanmar. In the 19th and 20th centuries, several specimens were described:
Trogon flagrans proposed by Salomon Müller in 1836 was a dark red-headed trogon collected on Mount Singgalang in Sumatra, Indonesia.
Harpactes yamakanensis proposed by C. B. Rickett in 1899 was an olive-brown red-headed trogon collected near Yamakan in Fujian, China.
Harpactes hainanus proposed by William Robert Ogilvie-Grant in 1900 was a specimen with a purplish crimson head and nape that was collected in the Wuzhi Mountains on Hainan Island.
Pyrotrogon erythrocephalus klossi proposed by Herbert C. Robinson in 1915 was a brilliant red coloured trogon collected on Ko Chang Island, Thailand.
Pyrotrogon erythrocephalus annamensis proposed by Robinson and C. Boden Kloss in 1919 were an adult male and four female red-headed trogons with ocraceous brown back and rump that were collected in a hilly area in southern Vietnam at elevations of .
Pyrotrogon erythrocephalus intermedius proposed by Norman Boyd Kinnear in 1925 were three specimens with a bright plumage that were collected in the Tonkin area.
Harpactes erythrocephalus rosa proposed by Erwin Stresemann in 1929 was a specimen collected in the mountains of northern Guangxi in China.
Harpactes erythrocephalus chaseni by Joseph Harvey Riley in 1934 were a male and female specimens from the Selangor in the Malay Peninsula.
Harpactes erythrocephalus helenae by Ernst Mayr in 1941 was a specimen from Myitkyina District in Myanmar.
Distribution and habitat
The red-headed trogon is widely distributed from central Nepal, Southeast Asia, southern China to Sumatra.
It is uncommon to scarce in Nepal where habitat destruction most certainly explains a rapid decline in population numbers. It is fairly common in northeastern India, frequent in Bhutan, and locally dispersed in Bangladesh.
It prefers upland forests and lives in dense broadleaved forests and in tropical and subtropical zones in the Himalayan foothills. In Southeast Asia, it frequents broadleaved evergreen forests from . In Myanmar, it lives in bamboo and oak forests at an elevation of .
In Laos, it occurs in evergreen forests and adjacent plains .
The forests in Vietnam appear to be a stronghold.
In northern, western and southern Thailand, it favours climax broadleaved evergreen forests between .
On the Malay Peninsula, it inhabits evergreen lowland, lower montane and taller upper montane forests at elevations ranging from . Farther south, it is rarely seen below .
Behaviour and ecology
The red-headed trogon has often been observed perching on shaded branches waiting for prey, alone or in pairs. Its flight between trees is often sluggish and very low, only a few meters above the ground.
It is most active in the early morning hours and at night, when pursuing moths at the edges of forest clearings.
In central southern Thailand, it shares habitat with the Orange-breasted trogon (Harpactes oreskios). The two species often follow flocks of foraging birds taking advantage of the insects they flush out.
In most regions, it is sedentary, but also been observed to migrate between different elevations in northern and southern Laos.
Calls
The male's call resembles that of the Eurasian golden oriole (Oriolus oriolus): a sequence of usually five to six, well-spaced mellow “tyaup” notes, repeated every minute. Occasionally the male calls an extended “pluu-du” note marked by a significant terminal drop in pitch. The call is repeated every 3–6 seconds.
Diet
The red-headed trogon feeds primarily on insects and their larvae, including green orthopterans, stick-insects, cicadas, millipedes, flies, beetles, centipedes, woodlice and moths. It also feeds on leaves and fruits.
Reproduction
The red-headed trogon usually builds nests in a natural tree cavity above the ground. The entrance hole is generally wide, and occasionally, the mating pair excavates the entire nesting cavity. Sometimes, it uses old nesting holes of woodpeckers and barbets.
The female lays 2 to 4 round, cream coloured, glossy eggs, measuring approximately . Both sexes contribute to the nesting process, namely excavating, incubating the eggs, brooding and feeding the offspring. Females incubate and spend more time brooding, also at night. Males provide food for the chicks. During the day, the pair broods in turns, but also incubate together. In Thailand, nesting occurs in March and continues until July. Chicks hatch after an incubation period of 18 days and leave the nest after 13.4 days.
In Northern India, females lay eggs between mid April and mid July, with a peak in May and June. In China and Myanmar, they lay eggs in April. On the Malay Peninsula dependent juveniles have been observed between early March and late May.

Mesorhabditis is a genus of nematodes.
Species in the genus Mesorhabditis exhibit an unusual form of parthenogenesis, in which sperm-producing males copulate with females, but the sperm do not fuse with the ovum. Contact with the sperm is essential for the ovum to begin dividing, but because there is no fusion of the cells, the male contributes no genetic material to the offspring, which are essentially clones of the female.

A sweetheart deal or sweetheart contract is a contractual agreement, usually worked out in secret, that greatly benefits some of the parties while inappropriately disadvantaging other parties or the public at large. The term was coined in the 1940s to describe corrupt labor contracts that were favorable to the employer rather than the workers, and usually involved some kind of kickback or special treatment for the labor negotiator.
The term is also applied to special arrangements between private corporations and government entities, whereby the corporation and sometimes a government official reap the benefits, rather than the public. No-bid contracts may be awarded to people who have political connections or make donations to influential politicians. Sometimes a sweetheart deal involves tax breaks or other inducements to get a corporation to do business in that city or state.
A "sweetheart settlement" may also occur in a legal context. For example, in a class-action lawsuit the attorneys representing a class of plaintiffs may reach an agreement with the defendant in which the primary result is a lucrative fee for the attorneys rather than maximum compensation for the class members.
Noted instances and allegations
In a 1947 unionization dispute, San Francisco area grocery store owners claimed that other stores who had "given in" to union demands had signed sweetheart deals with the unions.
In a 1949 dispute between the rival American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) involving unionization of the laundry industry in Indianapolis, Indiana, a lawyer for the 42 laundry and dry-cleaning plants testified before the National Labor Relations Board that an AFL union contract was not a sweetheart deal between the employers and AFL union officials, as alleged by the CIO.
The terms of a 2008 plea bargain to settle criminal charges against financier Jeffrey Epstein have been called a sweetheart deal by many commentators.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was said to contain an obscure sweetheart deal for certain tech companies.
Legal reform
The 1959 Landrum-Griffin Act was a federal law that attempted to prevent sweetheart labor contracts and other forms of corrupt dealing by unions.
2019 study
A 2019 study examined the language of government contracts, looking for "sweetheart terms" – wording that is "highly favorable to the firm, but not obviously advantageous to the government". They found that such language is more commonly included in contracts with firms that make political contributions.

Peter Carson (3 October 1938 – 9 January 2013) was an English publisher, editor and translator of Russian literature. He was educated at Eton College and learnt Russian at home from his mother and during his National Service years at the Joint Services School for Linguists. He has translated two titles for Penguin Classics: several of Anton Chekhov's plays, and Fathers and Sons by Ivan Turgenev. The latter was praised by reviewers in the Times and the Times Literary Supplement. Donald Rayfield wrote in the Times Literary Supplement: "If you want to get as close as an English reader can to enjoying Turgenev, Carson is probably the best." He ironically completed a translation of The Death of Ivan Ilyich, a story of a dying man, and A Confession shortly before his death.
He was married to Eleo Gordon.

In mathematics, in the area of additive number theory, the Erdős–Fuchs theorem is a statement about the number of ways that numbers can be represented as a sum of elements of a given additive basis, stating that the average order of this number cannot be too close to being a linear function.
The theorem is named after Paul Erdős and Wolfgang Heinrich Johannes Fuchs, who published it in 1956.
Statement
Let be an infinite subset of the natural numbers and its representation function, which denotes the number of ways that a natural number can be expressed as the sum of elements of (taking order into account). We then consider the accumulated representation function
which counts (also taking order into account) the number of solutions to , where . The theorem then states that, for any given , the relation
cannot be satisfied; that is, there is no satisfying the above estimate.
Theorems of Erdős–Fuchs type
The Erdős–Fuchs theorem has an interesting history of precedents and generalizations. In 1915, it was already known by G. H. Hardy that in the case of the sequence of perfect squares one has
This estimate is a little better than that described by Erdős–Fuchs, but at the cost of a slight loss of precision, P. Erdős and W. H. J. Fuchs achieved complete generality in their result (at least for the case ). Another reason this result is so celebrated may be due to the fact that, in 1941, P. Erdős and P. Turán conjectured that, subject to the same hypotheses as in the theorem stated, the relation
could not hold. This fact remained unproven until 1956, when Erdős and Fuchs obtained their theorem, which is even stronger than the previously conjectured estimate.
Improved versions for h = 2
This theorem has been extended in a number of different directions. In 1980, A. Sárközy considered two sequences which are "near" in some sense. He proved the following:
Theorem (Sárközy, 1980). If and are two infinite subsets of natural numbers with , then cannot hold for any constant .
In 1990, H. L. Montgomery and R. C. Vaughan were able to remove the log from the right-hand side of Erdős–Fuchs original statement, showing that
cannot hold. In 2004, Gábor Horváth extended both these results, proving the following:
Theorem (Horváth, 2004). If and are infinite subsets of natural numbers with and , then cannot hold for any constant .
General case (h ≥ 2)
The natural generalization to Erdős–Fuchs theorem, namely for , is known to hold with same strength as the Montgomery–Vaughan's version. In fact, M. Tang showed in 2009 that, in the same conditions as in the original statement of Erdős–Fuchs, for every the relation
cannot hold. In another direction, in 2002, Gábor Horváth gave a precise generalization of Sárközy's 1980 result, showing that
Theorem (Horváth, 2002) If () are (at least two) infinite subsets of natural numbers and the following estimates are valid:
<li>
<li> (for )
then the relation:
cannot hold for any constant .
Non-linear approximations
Yet another direction in which the Erdős–Fuchs theorem can be improved is by considering approximations to other than for some . In 1963, Paul T. Bateman, Eugene E. Kohlbecker and Jack P. Tull proved a slightly stronger version of the following:
Theorem (Bateman–Kohlbecker–Tull, 1963). Let be a slowly varying function which is either convex or concave from some point onward. Then, on the same conditions as in the original Erdős–Fuchs theorem, we cannot have , where if is bounded, and otherwise.
At the end of their paper, it is also remarked that it is possible to extend their method to obtain results considering with , but such results are deemed as not sufficiently definitive.

Ethel Mae Mertz (née Potter) (alternately "Ethel Louise," “Ethel May” and "Ethel Roberta"), played by Vivian Vance, is one of the four main fictional characters in the highly popular 1950s American television sitcom I Love Lucy. Ethel is the middle-aged landlady of the main character, Lucy Ricardo, played by Lucille Ball. Ethel was most likely born about 1905, and was raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She is married to Fred Mertz, played by William Frawley, with whom she had a career in vaudeville. The two female characters are close friends, habitually scheming together; Ethel is generally the voice of reason as a counterpart to Lucy's harebrained ideas.
Background
Ethel was born around 1905 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where her father, Will Potter, owned a sweet shop and soda fountain with the slogan "You can lick our cones, but you can't beat our sodas!". Ethel went on to a career in music and acting, yet got her start at Albuquerque's Little Theater, singing her signature number "Shortnin' Bread".
Although Ethel's mother is apparently alive and well during the first season, viewers never meet Mrs. Potter. A flapper in the 1920s, Ethel eloped and married Fred Mertz on May 3 in either 1933 or 1927; the length of their marriage changed during the series.
Ethel worked in vaudeville with Fred before settling down and purchasing their own brownstone apartment building in New York City, containing the apartment they rent to Ricky and Lucy Ricardo, though it is stated that the building is solely in Ethel's name. Some of Ricky's shows have included Ethel and/or Fred in the production, with the effect of making Lucy determined to get in on the act.
In appearance blonde and supposedly a beauty in her youth, Ethel is unsentimental yet warm, proud, and extremely loyal, with her tendency to be sharp-tongued leading to moments of hilarity. She has a fine soprano voice, among other artistic talents, but unlike Lucy is now unambitious and content as a housewife and landlady.
Somewhat lonely, she is devoted to Lucy and her family. Despite her common sense, she is often fascinated by the possibilities for excitement opened up by Lucy's mad schemes. Although continually complaining about Fred's penny-pinching and other faults, she defers to him far more than Lucy does to Ricky. Something of a gossip and an inveterate snoop, she often tries to read Lucy's mail, especially postcards, which she claims are fair game. At times slightly vain, as in one episode when a concert in New Mexico goes to her head, she has a thicker skin than Lucy and seldom takes offense. She is easily able to parry Fred's frequent disparaging remarks.
Ethel and Lucy, although landlady and tenant, are the best of friends, gossiping and supporting each other during difficult times. They are seen entering several business ventures together, including owning and running a dress shop and a diner, and marketing a homemade salad dressing. Though not afraid to be critical of Lucy, especially when Lucy's schemes create trouble for others, Ethel will always bail out her friend.
There are occasional episodes of competition between them, mostly in relation to show business. On occasions when they are in competition for the same part, Ethel, having actual experience, always has the edge over Lucy, which in turn leads Lucy to mention Ethel's greater age and weight. Despite their spats, they always make up again by the end of the show. Lucy relies a great deal on her friend's more practical nature and calmer disposition.
Along with Lucy's husband Ricky and her own husband, Fred, Ethel travels to many places in the United States and Europe, such as England, France, Italy, and Switzerland. They are a childless couple. Fred and Ethel eventually move to Connecticut with the Ricardos and continue as their neighbors there; they also appear regularly on The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour.
After I Love Lucy
Vivian Vance portrayed Lucille Ball's best friend in a recurring role on each of her next two sitcoms, The Lucy Show and Here's Lucy. In both sitcoms, Vance insisted her character's name also be Vivian, as she was reportedly tired of being identified as "Ethel" when spotted on the street.
Reception
According to Entertainment Weekly, she is one of the "greatest sidekicks."

José Eloy Alfaro Delgado (25 June 1842 – 28 January 1912) often referred to as "The Old Warrior," was an Ecuadorian politician who served as the President of Ecuador from 1895 to 1901 and from 1906 to 1911. Eloy Alfaro emerged as the leader of the Liberal Party and became a driving force protect fairness, justice and liberty. He became one of the strongest opponents of the pro-Catholic conservative President Gabriel García Moreno (1821–1875). The "Viejo Luchador" (in Spanish) played a central role in the Liberal Revolution of 1895 and fought against conservatism for almost 30 years.
Alfaro's major political legacies are considered to be strengthened national unity, securing the integrity of Ecuador's borders, and the increased secularization of the country. Alfaro led the modernization of Ecuadorian society through the introduction of new ideas, education, and systems of public transport and communication, including the engineering feat of the Transandino Railway linking Guayaquil with Quito. Alfaro's effigy appeared on the Ecuadorian 50-cent coin from the 2000 issue, and the Ecuadorian Army's military college bears his name, as have two ships of the Ecuadorian Navy.
Biography
Rebellious youth
Alfaro was born in Montecristi, Manabí, on 25 June 1842. His father was don Manuel Alfaro y González, a Spanish Republican native of Cervera del Río Alhama, La Rioja, Spain who arrived in Ecuador as a political exile; his mother was doña María Natividad Delgado López.
Alfaro received his primary education in his place of birth. After graduation he dedicated himself to helping his father with his business negotiations. During his youth he aligned himself with anticlerical liberalism, a doctrine later embodied in the Ecuadorian Radical Liberal Party. He fought against Presidents García Moreno, Borrero, Veintemilla and Camaño, and as a result he is traditionally known as the "Viejo Luchador" (Old Warrior). Eloy Alfaro experienced many serious difficulties in the various campaigns he initiated against the conservative Ecuadorian governments. He spent his fortune, acquired with the help of his Panamanian wife, Ana Paredes Arosemena, in those battles. Nine children were born of their marriage: Bolívar, Esmeraldas, Colombia, Colón, Bolívar(2), Ana María, América, Olmedo, and Colón Eloy; Rafael was born out of wedlock.
From a very early age Alfaro participated in acts of rebellion. He almost lost his life in the disastrous naval battle of Alajuela when he tried to disembark in Ecuador with a troop of revolutionaries and was defeated by Conservative Government forces. When his ship sank, he saved himself from drowning by clinging to a barrel. He participated in the battles of Montecristi, San Mateo, Esmeraldas, Guayaquil, Jaramijó, Gatazo, Cuenca, and Chasqui.
Alfaro was a model father and was magnanimous with friends and the destitute. He supported various liberals, such as the writer Juan Montalvo, to whom he offered monetary assistance. Once in power, he glorified the memory of Montalvo as a great teacher and an example to the Ecuadorian people. Even though Alfaro was not very well-educated, through force of character he was able to overcome this fault and impress others with his clear intelligence. During his exile, he travelled Central America and was granted the rank of "General de División" by the Nicaraguan Congress.
First presidency (1895–1901)
Alfaro, head of the Radical Liberals, was the leader of the Ecuadorian Liberal Revolution, carrying out a struggle that he waged from his youth in the 1860s until 1895 when the liberals finally took power in a coup d'état. In this uprising, he deposed President Vicente Lucio Salazar and declared himself a dictator on 5 June 1895 and was later named constitutional president from 17 January 1897 until 1 September 1901. The principal accomplishment of his first government was the introduction of the principle of secularism. Many public buildings in Quito including the Instituto Nacional Mejía and the first purpose build siege of the National Polytechnic School were commissioned in his administration to French architects.
Second presidency (1906–1911)
After initially supporting, but later coming to oppose, his successor, in 1906 he led another revolt, deposing elected President Lizardo García, being declared supreme dictator by the army and continuing in office until 12 August 1911. During this second presidency he enacted a number of changes, among them freedom of speech and the legalization of civil marriage and divorce. He constructed numerous public schools and inaugurated the right to a free and secular education. What is considered to be his greatest public work during this period was the completion of the Ferrocarril Transandino (Trans-Andean Railroad) connecting Guayaquil to Quito. Consistent with his anticlericalism, he suppressed the influence of the Catholic Church while in office. He seized much property of the Church, expelled religious orders and prohibited the establishment of any new monasteries or convents. His attempts to secularize Ecuadorian society were opposed by the Archbishop of Quito Federico González Suárez.
In 1911, he was removed from office by his former supporters. In 1911 he tried to strike a blow at the State in an attempt to return to power. He was captured near Guayaquil and sent to Quito on the railroad he had constructed. After he left office, during the administration of Emilio Estrada Carmona, Alfaro was severely critical of the government and his followers soon began to organize a series of military insurrections. Alfaro was exiled to Panama during the interim government of Carlos Freile Zaldumbide. He returned to Ecuador on 4 January 1912, and attempted another coup but was defeated, arrested and jailed by General Leonidas Plaza.
Assassination
On 28 January 1912, a group of pro-Catholic soldiers whose motto was "Muerte al indio Alfaro" (death to the Indian Alfaro), supported by a mob, broke into the prison where Alfaro and his colleagues were detained and dragged them along the cobbled streets of the city center. They were all dead when the horde arrived at the esplanade of El Ejido (city gardens) in the northern outskirts of town. The crowd finally burnt the corpses in the area where the present day park of El Ejido is located. (A monument was erected in the 1960s at the site.) Days later, Alfaro's remains were buried in Quito, in secret. They were transported to Guayaquil and deposited in a mausoleum there at some time in the 1940s. On the initiative of President Rafael Correa (in office from 2007 – 2017), some of the ashes of Eloy Alfaro were exhumed and re-interred with honors in the city of Montecristi, seat of the 2008 National Constitutional Convention.

Personal life
On July 3, 2004, Spelling married actor and writer Charlie Shanian. In July 2005, Spelling was filming the Lifetime TV-movie Mind Over Murder in Ottawa, during which she met actor Dean McDermott, who was then married to actress Mary Jo Eustace. Spelling and McDermott began cheating on their spouses the night they met. Spelling and Shanian separated in October 2005. Shanian cited irreconcilable differences when he filed for divorce, which was finalized on April 20, 2006.
Spelling married McDermott less than a month later, on May 7, 2006, in a private ceremony in Wakaya, Fiji. Spelling and McDermott renewed their vows on May 8, 2010, in Beverly Hills, California. The couple have five children together: three sons, Liam Aaron (born March 13, 2007), Finn Davey (born August 30, 2012) and Beau Dean (born March 2, 2017) and two daughters, Stella Doreen (born June 9, 2008) and Hattie Margaret (born October 10, 2011). She is also the stepmother to Jack Montgomery McDermott (born October 10, 1998), who is McDermott's son with Eustace.
Spelling anticipated a sizable inheritance from her father's $500 million estate after his death in 2006. The estate was to be divided primarily between Spelling, her brother Randy, and their mother Candy. Candy Spelling was the estate executor, but she and Tori Spelling were estranged. Tori and Randy Spelling each inherited $800,000, although Randy was not estranged from Candy. Candy established a $10 million trust fund for Tori's eldest child.
In her sixth book, Spelling It Like It Is, Spelling admitted to having financial troubles, due to the cancellation of her reality series, poor real estate decisions, and a difficult fourth pregnancy, during which she was hospitalized for ten weeks. In explanation, Spelling said, "...as my real estate obsession persists, it's starting to look more compulsive. Moving is expensive, and I've put us in a precarious financial situation."
Spelling is an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church Monastery.
2013 infidelity scandal and aftermath
In December 2013, after welcoming their second son, Us Weekly broke the news that McDermott was unfaithful to Spelling. The couple worked through the aftermath of the affair on a Lifetime series titled True Tori.
While Spelling and McDermott's marriage was back on track, the couple once again made headlines in 2016 for owing $39,000 to American Express in unpaid credit card bills. Candy, who was on good terms with her daughter, told TMZ at the time that she was helping out Spelling and her family financially.
In March 2018, Spelling and McDermott were in contact with the police three times over the course of nine days. On Thursday, March 1, McDermott called the police around 7:00 am to say that Spelling was going through some sort of mental breakdown. Per an LAPD spokesperson, the situation ended up being a “domestic incident” and that “no crime” was committed. Nearly a week later, on Wednesday, March 7, the Ventura County Sheriff's Office showed up at Spelling's doctor's office around 9:45 am because of her husband raising a concern. McDermott called the police to check up on his wife after she had left their house with one of their children and that he was worried about her well-being. The deputies located Spelling at the doctor's office, spoke to her and determined she and their kids were okay. Because no crime had been committed, no further action was taken. On Friday, March 9, Spelling and McDermott went out to dinner with their five children at the Black Bear Diner in Tarzana, California. However, the LAPD arrived at the restaurant and it appeared that the couple were having a serious conversation inside. Their meal was cut short when the family was escorted out the back of the restaurant. It was later reported that the reason the police were called to the diner was because the paparazzi would not allow them to eat in peace and for the safety of Spelling, McDermott and their children, they needed a police escort from the restaurant.
In February 2019, Spelling claimed they no longer had relationship problems, as they communicated.
In June 2021, it was reported that the couple's marriage had been in "trouble for over a year". They sparked split rumors after fans noticed that Spelling and McDermott stopped sharing photos of each other on social media, and both were seen out and about without their wedding rings on. A source told Us Weekly that things between the couple were "not great". Spelling appeared on Jeff Lewis' radio show, Jeff Lewis Live, on June 16, 2021, and revealed that she and McDermott don't sleep in the same bedroom anymore. On October 18, 2021, Spelling was spotted outside an attorney's office having a heated phone call, sparking more split rumors. She was seen holding a notebook that listed a 3 p.m. meeting with a lawyer and the topics of discussion included "assets", "support", and "custody."
As of June 2022, Spelling and McDermott are currently in the midst of a trial separation. A source has said that they have considered ending their marriage. “They know divorce will be expensive and it's not something they're willing to go through right now. They both feel trapped,” the source says. “Having kids makes it more difficult because they don't want their children to be unhappy, yet at the same time, Tori has been unhappy for quite a while now. They truly are still together for their kids.”

The Royal Naval Barracks, Chatham also known as HMS Pembroke was a naval barrack built between the Victorian Steam Yard and Brompton Barracks between 1897 and 1902. It was built on the site of a prison built in 1853 to house over 1,000 convicts, with the intention that they would be used to build the Dockyard extension.
History
During the Age of Sail, the Royal Navy manned its ships either by recruitment or impressment; crew were retained for as long as they were needed and then usually dismissed when their ship was paid off at the end of a voyage or campaign. The introduction of Long Term Service in 1853, however, prompted the Navy to look at providing more permanent quarters for seamen in home waters. At first, they were almost invariably housed in hulks; it was only towards the end of the century that purpose-built barracks began to be constructed at each of the three principal Royal Navy Dockyards: Chatham, Devonport and Portsmouth. These barracks were designed to provide not just accommodation but also recreation and training facilities for men who were waiting to be appointed to ships.
Designed by Colonel Henry Pilkington, construction of the Royal Naval Barracks at Chatham began in 1897 and completed in December 1902. By the beginning of the First World War, Chatham was one of the Royal Navy's three ‘manning ports' - together with Plymouth and Portsmouth - manned by men allocated to the Chatham Division. This role was to continue until the advent of central manning in 1956. In September 1917 the barracks Drill Hall (which was being used as overflow accommodation) suffered a direct hit from two bombs in September 1917, which killed over 130 men. In 1942, King George VI made a visit to Medway and HMS Pembroke, the Royal Naval Barracks at Chatham. After the war Chatham became home to the reserve, or standby fleet.
In 1957, the barracks and gunnery school were closed due to the local port divisions being replaced; however in 1959 the barracks re-opened as the Royal Naval Supply School, who trained staff in supply and secretarial work. When the Commander-in-Chief, The Nore, the regional operational commander appointment, was discontinued in March 1961, the barracks were being used as an accommodation centre for the re-fitting crews of the dockyard. The Drill Shed and Canteen were being used by the Dockyard. In 1970, all Naval establishments in Chatham were to be combined and known as HM Navy Base, under one officer 'Flag Officer, Medway and Port Admiral'. With the closure of the Dockyard and Naval Base in 1984 HMS Pembroke was also decommissioned; the barracks gates were finally closed on 31 March 1984.

Lillian Kemble (née Schmidt) (fl. 1900–1922) was an American stage and silent film actress. Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Karl (Carl) Schmidt, a German immigrant comedian and theatre manager, she made her first stage appearance at the age of 10, performing in German and English. She made her English-language debut at the Lyceum Theatre in Denver, and worked in several stock companies throughout the country. She made a name for herself on Broadway starring in George Broadhurst's 1906 original The Man of the Hour. She was leading lady for two seasons with the Castle Square Theatre company in Boston before joining the Poli Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. She also appeared in silent films, including a chief supporting role in The House of Mirrors (1916) with Frank Mills.
In 1898 she married the actor-singer Will S. Rising. They divorced in 1905, and a year later Kemble was co-respondent in the divorce case of fellow actor Charles D. Mackay and Georgie Elliott Porter, daughter of novelist Linn Boyd Porter. Kemble and Mackay were married shortly afterwards.

Franca Iacovetta (born 1957) is a "feminist/socialist" historian of labour and migration currently working at the University of Toronto.
Her dissertation, published as Such Hardworking People: Italian Immigrants in Postwar Toronto, was supervised by York University's Ramsay Cook. She has since edited numerous collections of case studies, examining the lives of so-called "marginalized peoples" in Canada and the United States. Her most recent book Gatekeepers was awarded the Canadian Historical Association's John A. Macdonald Prize in 2008.
She has been critical of J. L. Granatstein, who questioned the dominance of social history in recent Canadian historical-writing in Who Killed Canadian History?, calling it a "clearly offensive", "ill-conceived little book".

Fletching is the fin-shaped aerodynamic stabilization device attached on arrows, bolts, darts, or javelins, and are typically made from light semi-flexible materials such as feathers or bark. Each piece of such fin is a fletch, also known as a flight or feather. A fletcher is a person who attaches fletchings to the shaft of arrows.
The word is related to the French word , meaning 'arrow', via the ultimate root of Old Frankish .
Description
As a noun, fletching refers collectively to the fins or vanes, each of which individually is known as a fletch. Traditionally, the fletching consists of three matched half-feathers attached near the back of the arrow or shaft of the dart that are equally spaced around its circumference. Four fletchings have also been used.
In English archery, the male feather, from a cock, is used on the outside of the arrow, while the other two stabilizing feathers are from a female, or hen. Traditional archery lore about feather curvature is that a right handed archer should shoot a right winged feather and right handed helical, and a left handed archer should use the opposite. Slow motion cameras show the arrow does not begin to spin until it is well past the riser, and the most important point is to have consistency in fletching. Shooting a feathered arrow with a bow with a riser shelf, instead of a plastic vane, is wiser since the feathers will compress and flatten while coming off the bow.
On compound bows, feathers may be a hindrance, and plastic vanes are a better solution. At the high speeds coming off a compound bow, plastic vanes with no curvature still allow the arrow to fly straight without tumbling. Also, noise is increased with feathers on these higher-powered bows, which can be a problem for hunters.
Today, modern plastics may be used instead. Fletches were traditionally attached with glue and silk thread, but with modern glue/thread/tape this is no longer necessary, unless the arrow is a reproduction of a historical arrow. The fletching is used to stabilize the arrow aerodynamically. Feather fletches impart a natural spin on an arrow due to the rough and smooth sides of a feather and the natural curve, determined by which wing the feather came from. Vanes need to be placed at a slight angle (called an offset fletch), or set into a twist (called a helical fletch) to create the same effect, but all are there to impart stability to the projectile to ensure that the projectile does not tumble during flight.
More generally, "fletching" can refer to any structures added to a projectile to aerodynamically stabilize its flight, many of which resemble arrows in form and function. For instance, the feathers at the butt end of a dart (of the type cast using an atlatl) are very similar in purpose and construction to those used in arrows. Most of the techniques of fletching were likely adapted from earlier dart-making techniques. The fins used to stabilize rockets work in a similar manner.

Yeram Sarkis Touloukian (December 28, 1920 – June 12, 1981) was an American professor of mechanical engineering and director of the Thermophysical Properties Research Center (now known as CINDAS) at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. He was world-renowned for his work in thermophysics and his name has become synonymous with the field of thermophysical properties.
Early life
Touloukian was born December 28, 1920, of Armenian parents in Istanbul, Turkey. He received his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Robert College in Istanbul, Turkey in 1939. Following the completion of his degree, Touloukian went to the United States to pursue his graduate studies. He received his master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1941 and his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) from Purdue University in 1946.
While attending MIT in 1942, Touloukian was chairman of The M.I.T. East and West Association; an association that was organized to encourage mutual understanding between students from the East and the West.
Touloukian married Hersil Istanbullu on August 8, 1948, in London, England after a long distance courtship.
Career at Purdue University
After completing his Ph.D., Touloukian became an instructor at Purdue University. He was appointed to the position of Assistant Professor in the School of Mechanical Engineering in 1948, Associate Professor in 1953, and Full Professor in 1957. He became Distinguished Alcoa Professor of Engineering in 1967, and in 1970 was honored once again to the Chair of Distinguished Atkins Professor of Engineering.
Touloukian taught numerous graduate courses at Purdue University in thermodynamics and in heat and mass transfer. During his teaching career, he developed many new courses in physical thermodynamics and was the first to introduce a course in an engineering curriculum in the area of "Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes" in 1953. He was the major professor of a total of 65 Ph.D. and M.S. students and directed the original research for their Ph.D. dissertations and M.S. theses.
Besides his teaching and research career, Touloukian served as a consultant to a number of government agencies and industrial organizations. He was also appointed to numerous scientific and technical committees and boards of scientific and technical societies and government panels. These included:
National Academy of Sciences – National Research Council Advisory Board of the Office of Critical Tables (1958-1969)

Thermophysical Properties Research Center (TPRC)
Touloukian singlehandedly conceived and established the Thermophysical Properties Research Center (TPRC) at Purdue University in 1957. Under Touloukian's technical and administrative leadership, TPRC quickly attained national and international recognition as a unique institution; the first of its kind. The TPRC was the world center for organizing and disseminating data on the thermophysical properties of materials.
In the late 1950s the US Bureau of Standards brought together all that was then known about thermophysical properties of various materials. Information had multiplied since that time and Touloukian and others worked in whatever space was available in the School of Mechanical Engineering to bring the information up to date. The project was handled in three stages: 1. Retrieving of data on the thermophysical properties of about 10,000 different materials. 2. Reconciliation of theory and fact and filling in the gaps by means of research. 3. Assembling and publishing the information. After reaching a publishing agreement with McGraw-Hill and increasing support from the Space Agency, Air Force, Army, Wright Field and National Bureau of Standards, the project had grown to the point where it was too big for its operation in Mechanical Engineering. In 1962, the Trustees approved the construction of a new facility in McClure Park for the TPRC.
Expansion and restructuring
The Air Force established the Department of Defense (DoD) Thermophysical Properties Information Center (TPIC) at the TPRC in 1960.
The National Bureau of Standards selected TPRC in 1964 as one of the first three external centers to become a component of the National Standard Reference Data System (NSRDS).
The National Science Foundation established the Underground Excavation and Rock Properties Information Center (UERPIC) at TPRC in 1972.
The Defense Logistics Agency moved the Electronic Properties Information Center (EPIC) from Hughes Aircraft Company to Purdue University to merge with TPRC's TPIC in 1973, which resulted in the DoD Thermophysical and Electronic Properties Information Analysis Center (TEPIAC) of TPRC.
Due to the enlargement and scope of its operation by the addition of UERPIC, EPIC, and TEPIAC, the TPRC was restructured in 1974 to become the Center for Information and Numerical Data Analysis and Synthesis (CINDAS), which comprises all four of the centers.

Yedikule () is a neighborhood of Fatih, Istanbul in Turkey. It is named after the seven-towered Yedikule Fortress, which surrounds the neighborhood. Urbanized in the 16th century, the neighborhood became a hub for industrial and agricultural activities. Yedikule has a local football team that played in the TFF Second League for a season.
Marmaray passes through the neighbourhood, however Yedikule railway station is closed and the trains do not serve to the neighbourhood.
History
Urbanization of Yedikule started in 16th century, and became a major hub for industrial and agricultural activities. Yedikule Walls (also known as Theodosius Walls) are also an notable historical artifact. Its tower, Yedikule Fortress, constructed between 408-450 AD, and repaired after 740 Istanbul earthquake.
Ottoman period
Yedikule was known with its gardens, Yedikule Urban Gardens, which was also famous with its cabbages and lettuces and used more than 1500 years. According to the guarantor books of year 1735, there were 344 gardens (including nine gardens which is established between "Surdibi" area, which stretch between Yedikule Gate and Silivri Gate); according to a map from 1835, there were 102 gardens.
Yedikule (with Edirnekapı) was also become host for some establishments like slaughterhouses, soap and candle makers, and workshops.
Modern times
Yedikule became highly populated after the population boom in Istanbul between 1940s-1980s; and as a result of that, the Urban Gardens and industrial areas became residential areas and some parts of Urban Gardens used for build Otoyol 1 and create waste-filling areas in the 1970s. The municipality of İstanbul started a rehabilitation project for remaining parts of Urban Gardens. Ekrem İmamoğlu, as the Mayor of Istanbul, stated that: "I'm ashamed from that the walls (Yedikule Walls) hasn't been toured since years."
Soil and seismology
A major seismically active fault zone, the North Anatolian Fault, passes offshore from Yedikule in the Sea of Marmara.
Demographics
Yedikule was including a notable non-Muslim population and schools until the recent times. There is also Greek and Armenian churches and an Armenian hospital, Yedikule Surp Pıgiç Hospital. Its population is 18,879 according to 2019 census.
In popular culture
Kazım Koyuncu gave a concert in Yedikule Fortress in 2004. Yedikule also hosted thematic festivals such as Lettuce Feast () in the past.

Puerto Escondido is a town and municipality located in the Córdoba Department, northern Colombia.
History
In 1854 the Casimiro brothers, Máximo, José Blas and Nicomedes Díaz, arrived from Barú and settled in the place that today is known as Puerto Escondido Viejo. Another family named Barrios, also from the island of Barú, near Cartagena, attracted by the stories that the sailors kept about the fertility of these lands and the goodness of their inhabitants, came to settle in these places.
As the population increased, they decided to move their ranches to the site that today is called the Simón Bolívar neighbourhood, because it is near a lagoon that supplies water to the community. Puerto Escondido, the new one, became the main hamlet on this coast, for which the Assembly of the Department of Bolívar erected it as a district of the municipality of Lorica by Ordinance No. 42 of April 27, 1923.
By Ordinance No. 53 of April 24, 1928, the Bolívar Assembly clarified that the town of Puerto Escondido comprised the hamlets or aggregations of Yuca, Mangle, Alta Clara, Tierra Adentro, Agua Viva, Palmar, Morindó and Puerto Escondido.

ESPN America was a British-based European sports network, focusing on professional and collegiate sports of the United States and Canada. Originally launched on 5 December 2002 as NASN (the North American Sports Network), ESPN America broadcast a selection of top North American professional and collegiate sports leagues including Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association (NBA), National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Canadian Football League (CFL), 24 hours a day on digital cable and digital satellite television.
Formerly operated by Setanta Sports with backing from Benchmark Capital Europe, it was acquired by the American sports media company ESPN in March 2007. It was subsequently re-branded as ESPN America on 1 February 2009 before closing on 1 August 2013.
Programming
Programming on ESPN America varied from country to country. The channel operated three feeds throughout Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Nordic countries events shown on ESPN America included Major League Baseball, the College World Series, NCAA college football and college basketball, the NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship Frozen Four plus the Arena Football League, Major League Lacrosse, and the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship Final Four. In continental Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and Iceland the broadcast also included NFL programmes.
ESPN America also showed the Little-League World Series from Williamsport, PA and the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest from Coney Island in Brooklyn, NY.
NASN paid £11.6m in March 2006 for the rights to show ten live MLB games a week.
In 2006, ESPN programmes, including Baseball Tonight, Around the Horn, The Sports Reporters and Pardon the Interruption were dropped from the schedule as the contract between NASN and ESPN ended. However, they returned from 1 April 2007 after ESPN acquired the channel.
ESPN America also aired other ESPN US produced single-sport programmes, such as College Football Live, College GameDay, NBA Fastbreak and NASCAR Now. In addition, to mark the 30th anniversary of ESPN, the channel has been showing ESPN Films' 30 for 30 series.
On 28 October 2009, ESPN America began to be broadcast in 16:9 widescreen.
On 1 March 2010, ESPN America began showing a European edition of SportsCenter, anchored by Michael Kim. The 30-minute programme broadcast five days a week at 6am UK/7am CET with three repeat showings following immediately after, with an updated show at 10.30pm UK/11.30pm CET. The show was filmed at ESPN's headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, USA.
Up until the 2011–12 NHL season, ESPN America held the rights to live and delayed NHL matches as well as round-up programming such as NHL On The Fly, however these rights were not renewed for the UK, Ireland & the Nordic countries and are now held by different networks across Europe. However, they still hold the rights for other countries throughout continental Europe, such as Germany. ESPN America acquired the American Hockey League, a minor North American Hockey League broadcast rights as a replacement for the UK, Ireland and the Nordic countries.
In April 2012, SportsCenter moved from five to seven days a week with a new start time of 8am UK/9am CET. At this point, ESPN stopped producing a local version of SportsCenter, opting instead to broadcast an edited version of the 2am ET show from Los Angeles, cut to fit 45 minutes through removing commercial breaks and stories on European sports such as soccer. This show is then repeated at 8.45am, 4pm & 4.45pm (UK time).
Sale to ESPN
In late 2006, former owners Benchmark Capital Europe and Setanta Sports agreed to sell the network to ESPN for €70m. The sale was completed in March 2007 but the network continued to be part of the Setanta Sports Pack on satellite television until June 2009 when Setanta UK went into administration. The network became known as ESPN America on 1 February 2009 to coincide with Super Bowl XLIII. The channel continued to provide the same lineup of North American sports programming.
ESPN America HD
On 1 March 2010, the Nordic Canal Digital launched an HD version of ESPN America. The channel launched in the UK on the Sky platform on 21 June 2010. It was launched in Portugal on ZON Multimédia's cable platform on 24 November 2010 and later on MEO (Portugal)'s cable platform on 15 July 2011. In Germany, the Channel started airing over the Sky Germany platform on 27 October 2010. In Italy, the HD channel was launched on 1 February 2012.
Sale to BT Group and subsequent closure
On 25 February 2013, BT Group agreed to acquire ESPN's UK and Ireland TV channels business, consisting of ESPN and ESPN America, the value of the deal was not disclosed, but BT is understood to have paid "low tens of millions". At midnight on 1 August 2013 the channel ceased its operations in all Europe, Middle East and Africa.
In the UK and Ireland most contents were moved to the local version of ESPN (now known as BT Sport ESPN), whereas the non-North American content was added to the newly launched BT Sport. Meanwhile, in Germany rights were sold to new channel Sport 1 US. Digital live and on-demand coverage of the majority of content from ESPN America is available on ESPN Player.

The Harding County Courthouse, located on Pine St. in Mosquero, is the county courthouse in Harding County, New Mexico. The courthouse was completed in 1922; while the building had existed previously as a school, it was extensively remodeled to become the county courthouse. It is considered the grandest public building ever built in the county, the smallest in the state by population. The two-story building has a Classical Revival design with modest decoration; its main features include an entrance framed by piers and a cornice, pilasters above the entrance, and an egg and dart entablature. The courthouse grounds make up one of the only two dedicated public spaces in the county, along with the public square in Roy.
The courthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 7, 1987. It is one of 14 New Mexico county courthouses that were reviewed for their historical significance in 1987.

In the CONCACAF Fourth Round of qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the United States, Costa Rica, and Honduras finished in the top three places and qualified directly for the 2014 World Cup. Mexico finished in fourth place and defeated New Zealand in the CONCACAF – OFC play-off to gain a spot in the World Cup. Mexico finished in fourth place ahead of Panama after the United States scored two goals against Panama in stoppage time in the final match of qualifying; had Panama retained its 2–1 lead, they would have finished in fourth place and eliminated Mexico on goals scored, who had qualified for the previous five World Cups.
Format
The fourth round saw the three group winners and the three group runners-up from the third round compete in a single group of six teams. This stage is referred to as the Hexagonal or Hex, and has been used by CONCACAF to determine its World Cup finals entrants since the qualification tournament for the 1998 FIFA World Cup.
The matches were played from 6 February to 15 October 2013. The top three teams advanced to the World Cup finals tournament in Brazil, and the fourth-placed team advanced to a play-off against New Zealand, the winner of the Oceania qualifiers.
Qualified teams
The qualifiers for this round were determined by 16 October 2012.
Standings
Matches
The representative from the six national associations met together on 19 October 2012, but could not agree on the schedule for the fourth round. The draw for the fixtures was conducted by CONCACAF and FIFA on 7 November 2012, in Miami Beach, Florida.

A temple located in Koteshwar gained attention when the surrounding shallow lake was cleaned in a de-silting project under the Administration of Markod Gopalkrishna Shetty. During the cleanup a large statue was dredged up, sparking a more concerted effort which recovered several artifacts of historic and religious significance, including several sculptures, statues, bronzework and religious icons.

Thiên Hương (born 8 February 1944), usually credited as Tiny Yong, is a French singer, actress and restaurateur, who was a popular yé-yé singer in the 1960s. She was born in French Indochina, of Vietnamese ancestry.
Biography
Tôn Nữ Thị Thiên Hương was born in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, within French Indochina at the time. Her father was a doctor. As a child, she and her family moved to Saigon, and she studied at the Couvent des Oiseaux in Đà Lạt. In 1958, the family moved to Paris, where her father continued as a doctor and her mother opened a Vietnamese restaurant.
Thien Huong took acting lessons, and made her first appearances as a stage actress in 1960, in Albert Camus' Les Justes and Jean Cocteau's L'Épouse injustement soupçonnée. She also sang Vietnamese and French songs in a local cabaret, La table du mandarin. In 1961, Thien Huong released her first EP, Le Monde de Suzie Wong, on which she was accompanied by Jacques Loussier. She appeared on television in the shows L'École des vedettes and Discorama, and in Robert Hossein's film Le Jeu de la vérité. With singer Jean Philippe, she recorded "La Prison de bambou", which won the Prix Marco Polo de Venise in 1962. The same year, she appeared in Piero Pierotti's film, Marco Polo, sang on the soundtrack of Marcel Camus' film L'Oiseau de paradis, and continued with her television and nightclub appearances.
In 1963, Jacqueline and Henri Salvador signed her to their record label, Disques Salvador, and gave her the name Tiny Yong. Her first release on the label included the songs "En rêve", a version of Roy Orbison's "In Dreams", and "Tais-toi petite folle", a version of The Shirelles' "Foolish Little Girl", both of which became popular. They were followed by "Je ne veux plus t'aimer", her version of Goffin and King's "I Can't Stay Mad at You", first recorded by Skeeter Davis. Tiny Yong became popular on the radio show Salut les copains, which promoted her as one of the new wave of "yé-yé" singers, and several of her recordings became chart hits in France. She continued to appear regularly on French television, and in commercials, and became known as "la yéyé du pays du sourire" (although she did not come from Thailand, sometimes called the "land of smiles").
In 1964 she released the EP Je t'attendrai, which included "Les garçons m'aiment", a version of the Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich song "When the Boy's Happy (The Girl's Happy Too)". Another EP included "Tiny", a semi-autobiographical song, and she recorded several songs written by Henri Salvador, as well as a version of the Beatles' "Eight Days a Week" ("Huit jours par semaine"). She also appeared in the film Les Parias de la gloire, and in 1965 took part in the Rose d'Or contest. In April 1966 she made her last television appearance. She ended her recording career soon afterwards, following a disagreement with Jacqueline and Henri Salvador.
She appeared in Nicolas Gessner‘s 1967 film, La Blonde de Pékin. In 1968, she returned to Saigon where she performed in cabaret before deciding to retire from public performances. She returned to Paris in 1970, and made a final acting appearance in the television series Allô Police.
After retiring from the entertainment industry, she married and set up several restaurants, at first in Paris and later in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, Pont-sur-Yonne, and Montpellier. She continues to live in Montpellier.
A compilation of her recordings was issued on CD in 2017.

Chbab Srey (, ; ) is a Cambodian code of conduct for women. Written in the form of a poem, it is a pendant to Chbab Pros (, ; ) which applies for men. Chbab Srey details a mother's advice to her recently married daughter. The mother, as narrator, advises her daughter to maintain peace within the home, walk and talk softly, and obey and respect her husband. It has been at the center of debate and controversy in recent years in Cambodia.
History
Origin: an ancestral vision of the woman
The Chbab Srey is a poem that was orally passed down from the 14th to 19th centuries, before it was codified in written form.
A classical piece of Khmer literature attributed to King Ang Duong
The Chbab Srey was composed as a poem by King Ang Duong in 1837. Authorship however has been contested by Judy Ledgerwood who attributes it rather to Minh Mai, who penned the best known manuscripts of the Chbab Srey. The narrative takes the form of Queen Vimala instructing her daughter Indrandati before she leaves her parents' kingdom. According to researcher Trudy Jacobsen, this writing may have been a misogynistic answer by King Ang Duong to the crowning of Ang Mey in Vietnam.
King Ang Duong is also said to have been influenced by the more conservative strain of Buddhism that became known as the Dhammayuttika Nikaya sect coming from Thailand. It quickly became a classical piece of Khmer literature taught in schools until modern times.
A vision of women still common but no longer accepted
In the early 1960s, a certain women's liberation movement emerged, as can be seen from the movies of Sihanouk, but hardly made it beyond privileged circles. During the Khmer Rouge regime, the Chbab Srey was set aside only to be replaced by more horrible atrocities including wide-scale rape, mass weddings and forced pregnancies. After the fall of the Communist regime, Cambodia ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination against Women (CEADW) in 1992.
The committee in charge of monitoring the progress of the country (Committee on the elimination of Discrimination against Women) expressed its concern in its observation in 2013 that “ the Chbab Srey, the traditional code of conduct for Women is deeply rooted in Cambodian culture and society and continues to define everyday life on the basis of stereotypical roles of women and men in the family and in society".
The Chbab Srey was taken out of the mandatory curriculum in public schools by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Women Affairs in 2007. However, as of 2015, a shorter version of it was still being taught to Khmer literature students from grade 7 to 9. These include rules such as “Happiness in the family comes from a woman,” “A woman's poor character results in others looking down upon her husband,” and “Don't go for a walk to somebody's house.”
Issues
Domestic violence
According the human rights advocate Kek Galabru, there is a widespread and long-lasting subservience and inferiority of women to men that makes the issue of domestic violence in Cambodia a complex issue. The traditional Chbab Srey has taught women in Cambodia to be subservient to men and allowed a marital exemption for rape for generations. For that reason, the Chbab Srey has been accused of encouraging a culture of domestic violence in Cambodia.
Empowerment of women
More generally, feminist voices have arisen in recent years in Cambodia to question to general vision of women imposed by the Chbab Srey. Beyond the legal dictates, the Chbab Srey "stifles women's ability to pursue their own goals and aspirations in life" according to Khmer activist Kounila Keo.

Chaos Chaos are an American indie synthpop band based in Brooklyn, New York. The band was formed in Seattle under the name Smoosh in 2000 and adopted their current name in 2012. The band consists of two sisters, who founded the band as children: singer/keyboardist Asya "Asy" Saavedra (born February 2, 1992) and drummer Chloe Saavedra (born March 5, 1994). They released three LPs as Smoosh, and have produced two further EPs, several singles, and a fourth full-length album as Chaos Chaos.
History
Smoosh: 2000–2012
Smoosh started in 2000 when the family was at a Seattle music store The Trading Musician, standing in line to restring a violin. Asy and Chloe wandered into the drum section of the store, where Chloe met Jason McGerr, the drummer for Death Cab for Cutie. The family eventually left with a $600 drum kit for Chloe, McGerr's card from the Seattle Drum School, "and no violin." When McGerr learned that Asy had been playing the piano and writing songs since she was very young, he offered to help them both. Neither Asy nor Chloe read music. Asy began piano training, but she soon quit because she found it boring.
In 2000, Smoosh released Tomato Mistakes, a two-track single that they mailed free of charge to anyone who wanted it. Four years later, in September 2004, Smoosh's full-length debut She Is like Electric was released under Pattern 25 Records. By the time Smoosh released their second LP, on June 6, 2006, titled Free to Stay, they were signed to Seattle-based indie label Barsuk Records. Its third and title track, "Free to Stay", was an early song featured on Tomato Mistakes. Asy also plays guitar on the track 'Waiting for Something' off Free to Stay. The second album also features the song "Find A Way" which Smoosh performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on July 12, 2006, marking their first performance on late night TV. As they toured with Eels as part of a world tour in mid-2006, they are also featured on the California-based band's live DVD/CD Live and in Person! London 2006.
On August 5, 2007, Smoosh performed at Lollapalooza 2007 at Chicago's Grant Park. Their set included a cover of "This Modern Love" by Bloc Party, whom they would later tour with that same year in September. Earlier that year, they also performed a headlining spring tour on the east coast with The Postmarks. The band played "Pajama Party Time" on Zoom episode 20 of Season 4, originally broadcast in 2002, and again in episode 5 of season 1 of the children's TV series Yo Gabba Gabba in 2007. The Saavedra sisters have been the only members of the band. Their younger sister, Maia Saavedra, played bass for them in 2007.
As Smoosh, critics compared the band's sound to that of Tori Amos and PJ Harvey and were impressed with the young writers and performers. Smoosh opened for many leading Pacific Northwest bands including Pearl Jam, Death Cab for Cutie, Sleater-Kinney, and the Presidents of the United States of America, as well as for other acts such as Mates of State, Jimmy Eat World, Cat Power (who also covered their song "Rad"), Nada Surf, Sufjan Stevens and The Go! Team. Asy collaborated with Seattle indie band Head Like a Kite to create the songs "Noisy at the Circus" (which can be found on Head Like a Kite's first album Random Portraits of the Home Movie), "Daydream Vacation" (which can be found on their second album There Is Loud Laughter Everywhere), and "Let's Start It All Again" (which can be found on their album Dreams Suspend Night, and also available via the KEXP Song of the Day website). Asy also lends her voice to the soundtrack of the musical film God Help the Girl created by Stuart Murdoch of Belle & Sebastian, where she sings on the songs "I Just Want Your Jeans" and "A Down and Dusky Blonde". She also provided the vocals on the song "I Fell for the Fall" by Swedish band Karma Tree. In early 2008, they toured with Tokyo Police Club and The Dresden Dolls. In June 2010, Smoosh released their third album, Withershins (previously titled The World's Not Bad).
Chaos Chaos: 2012–present
In 2012 the Saavedras changed the band's name to Chaos Chaos, abandoning the name "Smoosh" because the term had become associated with Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi after an episode of South Park. Their current name is derived from a historical scientific name for a species of amoeba, which they liken to their music as it is "simple but always changing".
Chaos Chaos released an EP, S, on October 16, 2012. On February 23, 2013, they released a single, "In This Place." On October 7, 2014, Chaos Chaos released another EP, Committed to the Crime. One of its tracks, "Do You Feel It?", was featured in the animated sci-fi cartoon Rick and Morty season two episode "Auto Erotic Assimilation." This brought the band a lot of recognition. Chaos Chaos provided vocals to George Watsky on the song "Brave New World" on his album x Infinity, which released on August 19, 2016. On August 27, 2017, the duo released the single "Terryfold", which features lead vocals from Rick and Morty co-creator and voice actor Justin Roiland, a longtime fan of the band. The song became the band's first charting single when it debuted at #33 on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart in September 2017.
After releasing the singles "Dripping with Fire" and "On Turning 23" in late 2017 and "Pink Politics" in April 2018, the band released the full-length album Chaos Chaos on May 15, 2018. To promote the album, they also began headlining their first nationwide tour on April 12 of that year.
At the request of Kim Kardashian, Chaos Chaos and Justin Roiland collaborated a second time to produce a song for Kanye West (a fan of Rick and Morty) as a birthday present. It was released on West's 41st birthday (June 8, 2018) as a single called "Kanye's B-Day Song" featuring Rick and Morty.
In 2019, the band released three singles that are currently unattached to any album: "Armed and Dangerous," "Theaters," and "Improv Song."

La Révolution prolétarienne was a syndicalist magazine established by Pierre Monatte and Robert Louzon in Paris in 1925.
Monatte was politically active for over twenty years as a syndicalist before joining the French Communist Party and advocating affiliation to the Comintern. By 1924 he was becoming increasingly critical of the autocracy he experienced in the party, which he saw as a denial of both Bolshevism and Communism. After writing an open letter to party members with Alfred Rosmer and Delagarde on 24 November 1924, they were expelled before the conference held on 5 December 1924. He retained a view of himself as a communist and launched La Révolution prolétarienne as a monthly syndicalist-communist magazine. The first issue included a second open letter to members of the Communist Party.
In 1939 La Révolution prolétarienne ceased publication, reappeared in 1947 and still exists.

The Cavallo Romano della Maremma Laziale, or "Roman horse of the part of the Maremma that is in Lazio", is a horse breed native to the Lazio region of Italy. An ancient breed, it was officially recognised only in 2010; it is now one of the fifteen indigenous horse "breeds of limited distribution" listed by the AIA, the Italian breeders' association. The Lazio region has assigned it the conservation status "at risk of erosion". The population numbers about 800, of which most are in the comune of Monte Romano in the province of Viterbo; a herd of approximately 200 is at Ponzano Romano in the province of Rome, and others are in the province of Rieti.
History
The breed register for the Cavallo Romano della Maremma Laziale was opened on 19 October 2010, and the breed standard confirmed by Ministerial Decree 27202, dated 1 December 2010. DNA testing had shown that the traditional working horse of the Maremma of Lazio was not only physically but genetically distinguishable from its counterpart in the Tuscan Maremma, the Maremmano, with which it had previously been classed. The two populations are reported as having common origins but limited overlap, with the Roman horse showing greater variability and a higher proportion of "ancestral" genes; Ripert reports informally that the Cavallo Romano della Maremma Laziale has 38.5% genes of the original type, while the registered Maremmano population has only 12%. The genetic study, carried out by the Consorzio per la Sperimentazione, Divulgazione e Applicazione di Biotecniche Innovative (CONSDABI), National Focal Point for Italy of the Animal Genetic Resources project of the FAO, was presented at the 12th conference on "New findings in equine practice" held at Druento (Turin, Italy), 11–13 November 2010.
The ARSIAL (regional agency for development and innovation in agriculture of Lazio) suggests that this is the same horse breed as the "Cavallo Romano" that was well described in 19th century treatises; authors who discuss the Cavallo Romano include Moreschi (1903) and Fogliata (1910). It is also suggested that the Cavallo Romano della Maremma Laziale descends from the horses of the ancient Romans, such as that of Marcus Aurelius, or even of the Etruscans.
Characteristics
The Cavallo Romano della Maremma Laziale may be bay, black, chestnut or grey; limited facial markings (star and stripe) are permitted, as are white socks. Males measure at the withers, females . The girth and cannon measurements are similar for both sexes, approximately and respectively. The head is well set on, slightly long and heavy, and the profile convex or Roman; the neck is thick, muscular and arched, the mane and tail long and thick.
The shoulder is muscular and tends to be straight, the chest is broad with substantial muscle, the girth is deep and the back is short, straight and muscular, sometimes slightly concave. The croup is broad and sloping, and the tail is set low. The legs are solid, strong and muscular, the hooves broad and strong. Horses with concave profile, long or drooping ears, or poor conformation of the legs are not admitted for registration.
The action of the Cavallo Romano is lively and well-marked, and its temperament docile and courageous. It is sure-footed on even the most difficult terrain.
For comparison, the description of the Cavallo Romano given by Moreschi in 1903 is this:
Uses
Although sometimes employed in the past as a warhorse and as a carriage horse, the primary use of the Cavallo Romano was as a working horse for the management of open-range livestock, particularly horses, cattle and sheep. Until the land drainage and reclamation of the fascist era the Maremma region was, like the campagna romana and the Pontine Marshes, wild and inhospitable, and inhabited mostly by vast herds of livestock, transhumant shepherds and the cavalcanti, the "riders", as the butteri of the Maremma Laziale were called. The traditions of the cavalcanti and their style of working riding, the Monta italiana da lavoro, are still taught and transmitted by a small number of riding academies. In addition to herding work, the Cavallo Romano is used today as a saddle horse for trekking; other uses include agricultural and light draught work, use as pack animals, and the production of high quality meat and of milk for paediatric or cosmetic use.

The 2000 Basildon District Council election took place on 4 May 2000 to elect members of Basildon District Council in Essex, England. One third of the council was up for election and the Labour party lost overall control of the council to no overall control.
After the election, the composition of the council was
Labour 20
Conservative 18
Liberal Democrats 4
Election result
The results saw the Conservatives make gains from both Labour and Liberal Democrats to go from 11 to 18 seats on the council. This deprived Labour of a majority on the council after 5 years and reduced Labour's lead over the Conservatives to just 2 seats. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats lost half their seats to fall to have just 4 councillors, but were left with the balance of power.
The Conservatives gained marginal seats in Basildon from Labour including Laindon, Langdon Hills and Pitsea East. They also took all the seats the Liberal Democrats had been defending in Billericay and Wickford.
Following the election the Liberal Democrat leader Geoff Williams said "issues will be decided on their merit and not on party politics".
All comparisons in vote share are to the corresponding 1996 election.

Donald William Trevor Bruce, Baron Bruce of Donington (3 October 1912 – 18 April 2005) was a British soldier, businessman and Labour politician.
Early life
Bruce was born in Norbury, South London, the son of insurance broker William Trevor Bruce. He was educated at Donington Grammar School in Donington, Lincolnshire and qualified as a Chartered Accountant in 1936.
Military career
Bruce served in the Territorial Army from 1931 to 1935, later in World War II, in the Royal Signals, where he reached the rank of Major in 1942, serving in the anti-aircraft defence of London before joining Dwight D. Eisenhower's staff as an Intelligence Officer in the preparations for D-Day for which he won a mention in dispatches.
Parliamentary career
From 1945 to 1950 Bruce was Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Portsmouth North. During the same time he was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of Health Aneurin Bevan, and compiled many notes and documents with the aim of writing a biography of Bevan, a task later taken up with the assistance of Bruce's papers by Michael Foot.
When Portsmouth North was abolished in 1950, Bruce stood in the successor seat of Portsmouth West, but was narrowly beaten by the Conservative Terence Clarke.
After Parliament
He also set up his own accountancy firm and ran it until 1977 when it merged with Halpern and Woolf which itself merged with Casson Beckman merging finally with Baker Tilly for whom Bruce still worked in his eighties as a consultant.
On 20 January 1975, he was created a life peer as Baron Bruce of Donington, of Rickmansworth in the County of Hertfordshire. In 1976, he was appointed to the European Parliament, but resigned in 1979.

Assabe and Sabina was a regionally popular Pennsylvania German dialect radio program that was broadcast from radio station WSAN in Allentown, Pennsylvania from 1944 until 1955.
The show centered on the relationship between Der Assabe Mumbauer, a Pennsylvania German farmer, and his wife, Die Sabina Mumbauer. The character of Assabe was a "humorous prankster who frequently was in difficulty with his wife or with his neighbors."
History
Lloyd A. Moll created the program, and played the role of Der Assabe until his death, just a few weeks after the show's launch. Dr. Harry Hess Reichard, professor of German at Muhlenberg College and noted Pennsylvania German scholar, then assumed the role of Assabe. Paul R. Wieand, a local teacher, author and writer of dialect plays, played the role of Die Sabina, Assabe's wife.
The show was first broadcast on January 16, 1944, and ran until 1955. It ran each Sunday, from 1:00 p.m. to 1:15 p.m.
After Moll's death, scripts were written by the Rev. Clarence R. Rahn. These scripts were archived in the Shadek-Fackenthal Library of Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, but are currently in the collection of the Evangelical and Reformed Historical Society]at Lancaster Theological Seminary. A larger collection of Assabe and Sabina scripts is at Muhlenberg College.
Cultural influence
Assabe and Sabina was extremely popular amongst the Pennsylvania German-speaking populations of Lehigh and Northampton counties, and thousands listened to the program weekly. The show served to sustain interest in Pennsylvania German language and culture in the period during, and immediately after, World War II.

The Epistles are one of the Seven Treatises of Manichaeism. It is derived from the Middle Ancient Persian , which means "Letter Collection". They have been long known among Manichaean scriptures They were originally written during the years of Mani's public mission in the Sasanian Empire (ca. 240-276 C.E.). They were collected together by his followers and became one of the canonical books of the Manichaean community It served a purpose of explaining the doctrine and arguing for the correctness of Manichaeism
Scripture content
This scripture is collectively referred to as the "Collection of Letters". The titles of 76 letters are listed in Ibn Nadim 's "Study of Groups of Books". The writers included Mani and his successors. The format of Mani's letters is very similar to that of St. Paul's, because Mani took the form of Paul in the new era.
Sealed Letter
The most famous of the Manichaean letters is the Letter of the Seal, which Mani wrote to his followers from prison before his death. This letter is read by Manichaeans every year during the Feast of the Holy Throne. The closing part of the letter in Old Persian is preserved in the Manichean Prayer and Confession Book read by Hennings.
"...From my most beloved son Mar Ammo, from the dear children who are with me. To all priests, bishops and apostles, to all religious and lay people, to brothers and sisters - great and small, pious, perfect, righteous people, to all who have received the Gospel from Me, who rejoice in My precepts and good works, and who are firm in faith and have no doubts. Greetings to all of you."
Coptic text
In Egypt, some Coptic translations of some epistles were found, but the whereabouts of these translations are unknown during WWII. In the documents found in Kellis, fragments of a collection of letters were also found. Gardner published five fragments of letters:"Mani, the Apostle of Jesus Christ, and all the other brothers who are with me - To <name lost> my loved one, and all the brothers who are with you, each one according to his name. Peace through God the Father, and our lord Jesus Christ, be it upon you my loved one; and may it guard you ... you, your body, and your spirit. The Father, the God of truth..."Indeed, my loved one, I was obliged to write a mass of words to you this time; but God himself knows that these young people, whom you sent and who came, found me in some pain. For I was sick ... For all of thirty years to the day I was never sick like this occasion; and these young people who had come, I wished merely to proclaim the news to them, and by mouth send to you without letter. However, my heart was grieved by the words of the brothers who are ill; because of this I myself was oppressed, (and) in great pain have I written to you these ten sayings that I might comfort your heart my child. I myself suffered ... Know therefore that these words I heard in suffering, you too receive them in joy and confirmation; and you understand them. ... on account of (?) our good saviour, our god (?) Christ Jesus, by whose name I chose you (pl.). I have gathered you in by his hope; I have caused you to he has woven together by his sign and his good; I have perfected you by his understanding; I have made you strong by <his> faith; I have made his wisdom and his knowledge shine forth in your teachings like the sun. His is this blessed name and this strong power. He is the one who can bless you all, my children, my loved ones. He can set his love in your head (?), [which (?)] is the Light Mind. His great faith he [can set (?) in] your guarding thoughts; his perfection he can establish [in your] good insights; and his long-sufferingness he [can ...] in your good counsels; his wisdom [...] also he can perform in your sharp considerations. The saying that our lord proclaimed by his mouth [has been] fulfilled in me: The one who eats [salt] with me [has] raised his foot against me'. I (Man) myself too, this has happened to me: One who eats salt with me at the evening table, with my clothes upon his body, he has raised his foot against me; just as an enemy would do to his enemy. All these things have I suffered from my children and my disciples, they whom I have saved from the bondage of the world and the bondage of the body; whilst I bear them from the death of the world. I, all these things, I have endured and suffered in their season from a multitude. I reveal to you, my child, my loved one: Whoever wills life, and to add life to his life, long-suffering is what awaits him; because without long-suffering he will not be able to live. For, long-suffering has every thing within it.
Paraphrase in Latin and Chinese
In addition to daily church business, some of Mani's letters are also expositions of doctrine. In Augustine's Latin writings, more than ten fragments of Mani's Fundamental Letters are preserved. These fragments mainly expound on the diachronic trinitarian doctrine of how this world was created.
Parts of this scripture are also quoted in the Dunhuang document "Incomplete scripture of Manichaeism": "The Nimman Sutra says: 'If the Dana do not have the good dharma, the pure light, the vigorous wisdom and benefit are all ready in the body, that is, the new man, with all his merits and virtues."

The General Union of Textile Workers was a trade union representing textile workers in England, most of its members being weavers in the West Riding of Yorkshire.
History
The union was founded in 1881 following a strike at Newsome Mills in Huddersfield. Initially known as the Huddersfield and District Power Loom Weavers' Association, it led a major strike of 4,000 weavers for thirteen weeks in 1883. The strike was ultimately defeated; although a pay scale was agreed, this was a maximum rate, and mills could pay lower rates. The union added "Woollen Operatives" to its name, gradually attracting a more diverse membership. It also began accepting members elsewhere in the West Riding, and in 1894 became the West Riding of Yorkshire Power Loom Weavers' Association, with membership over 3,000.
Allen Gee became the union's general secretary in 1888. Under his leadership, it survived through a decline to only 2,300 members in 1898, and changed its name to the General Union of Weavers and Textile Workers the following year. Now seeing itself as an industrial union accepting as members all workers in the industry, this marked the start of rapid growth. Membership rose to 4,500 in 1910, of which almost half were women - unusual for a union of the period - then to 13,400 in 1914, when it became the "General Union of Textile Workers", and 64,000 by 1918.
In 1922, the union merged with the National Society of Dyers and Finishers and the Yeadon, Guiseley and District Factory Workers' Union, forming the National Union of Textile Workers.
Election results
The union sponsored Ben Turner as a Labour Party candidate in several Parliament elections, and from 1922 he served as a Member of Parliament.

Soppo is the name of two villages, Great Soppo and Small Soppo in Buea, western Cameroon. It is located at around .
From 1904 to 1914 it was the headquarters of the German colonial military forces ("Schutztruppe"). Because of its moderate temperatures, owing to the altitude of the village (approximately 700 m), the Baptist missionary Carl Jacob Bender turned Great Soppo into a retreat for missionaries in the coastal regions of Cameroon. The church he built in the 1930s still hovers above the village.
The current traditional ruler of Great Soppo is His Royal Highness Etina Monono.

Sphenocoelus is an extinct genus of brontothere endemic to North America during the Middle Eocene 46.2—40.4 mya), existing for approximately . Fossils have been found only in southern Wyoming and eastern Utah.
In life, it would have resembled a hornless rhinoceros, to which it was distantly related. However, it was smaller than modern rhinos, standing about high at the shoulders, and had a much longer head. Its teeth were adapted to eating soft vegetation, such as forest leaves. Like other brontotheres, it had four toes on the front feet, and three on the hind feet, and the animal is unlikely to have been able to run fast.

The afternoon movie was a popular practice of local television stations from the 1950s through the 1970s. It consisted of the daily weekday showing of old films usually between 12:30 and 2:00 P.M; if the film ran two hours or more, it was split into two parts. Atlanta local station WSB-TV, for instance, would show films in this time slot under the umbrella title Armchair Playhouse. Popular titles, such as the 1953 House of Wax, The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (also 1953), the 1935 Mutiny on the Bounty, the 1949 The Secret Garden, or National Velvet (1944), would often turn up as afternoon movies (years later, in 1978, National Velvet was shown on network television, by CBS). During the Christmas season, such films as Gulliver's Travels (1939), Hansel and Gretel: An Opera Fantasy (1954), or A Christmas Carol (1938) would sometimes be telecast on local stations after the network telecast of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.
These afternoon movie telecasts existed in an age where was no cable TV, home video, or video-on-demand. Viewers either had to watch an old film when it was telecast, or wait for it to be shown at a revival house.
WABC-TV in New York City ran The 4:30 Movie weekdays from 1968 to 1981. Other ABC owned-and-operated stations also used the format at different times in the afternoon.
Some local stations also telecast morning movies in much the same format; these were often shown from 9:30 A.M. to 11:00 A.M., and, like the afternoon films, would often be split up into two parts. Many obscure B-films turned up as morning movies, though occasionally a "big film" such as The Miracle of the Bells would be telecast.
As more and more films began to be televised by entire networks in prime time, and as more and more soap operas, talk shows, and daily syndicated programming filled the network airwaves and became extremely popular, the daily afternoon movie on TV was gradually phased out on the local affiliates belonging to the three major commercial networks (NBC, CBS and ABC). Ted Turner's WTBS-TV (now Meredith-owned WPCH), on the other hand, showed old films such as the 1960 Little Shop of Horrors and the edited version of Joan of Arc both in the morning and in the afternoon throughout the 1970s, when it was called WTCG.
Today, films are often shown locally on commercial stations in the afternoon on weekends (especially since there are now so many more television channels), but none are shown in the afternoon on a weekday on any local TV station.

was the senior staff officer in charge of operations of the 32nd Japanese Army at Okinawa during the American invasion of that island during World War II.
Defense of Okinawa
Yahara, who had taught strategy at the Army War College, was assigned to Okinawa prior to the anticipated American invasion to organize its pre-invasion strategy. His recommended strategy for fighting the American invaders was to continue to tie up the American military as long as possible in a war of attrition (jikyūsen, 持久戦), so that the rumored American invasion of Kyūshū, Japan, would be delayed, thereby allowing Kyushu defenders more time to better prepare their defenses.
Once the Okinawa invasion started, Yahara recommended holding back Japanese forces for as long as possible and using them primarily in a defensive posture, rather than an aggressive one. However, Chief of Staff of the Army, Lieutenant General Isamu Cho, soon became frustrated by the relative inaction of the battlefield, and recommended banzai charges at the Americans.
Yahara disagreed with this recommendation, but went along with it. But when it was clear that Cho's samurai-charge methods were not working, but, rather, causing huge numbers of casualties among the Japanese infantry, along with loss of territory, Cho relented and allowed Yahara to continue to make tactical and operational decisions.
Yahara's method, since he did not have the firepower to fight the Americans directly in battle and knew that he could not possibly win, was to fight from caves as long as possible and then, once the caves were lost, to "retreat and defend"—time after time—until there was no longer any room to retreat to.
Escape and capture
When Lieutenant General Cho and Lieutenant General Mitsuru Ushijima, decided to commit ritualistic suicide in Mabuni caves. Yahara requested permission to commit seppuku alongside them, but Ushijima refused, telling him "If you die there will be no one left who knows the truth about the battle of Okinawa. Bear the temporary shame but endure it. This is an order from your army commander." Cho instructed Yahara to make his way through the American lines to northern Okinawa and report to Tokyo on what had happened, and gave him 500 yen for the journey.
After the two generals had committed suicide, Yahara hid with several other staff officers in a small cave whose entrance they had blocked with stone and waited for the opportunity to escape. After hearing American troops drilling into the rock above them they relocated to another cave before deciding to split up. Disguising himself as a civilian, he made his way down Mahuni Hill and eventually joined two other soldiers, the three of them joining a large group of approximately 50 civilians sheltering in a cave. The group was discovered by the Americans who following an air attack on the cave convinced the group to surrender. Yahara lead them out and was mistakenly judged to be a Japanese English teacher. He was taken to a holding camp before being taken to a house on Chinen Peninsula which he shared with 30 other civilian refugees. He later joined a work detail before eventually three weeks after his escape from the 32nd Army headquarters his true identity was discovered by the U.S. military. Now a prisoner of war with privileges due to his rank as having been the third highest ranked Japanese officer on the island, he was transferred to 10th Army headquarters where he was interrogated.
Following the end of the war Yahara was repatriated back home to Japan in January 1946.
Literary contribution
After the war Yahara wrote his account of the battle. His Okinawa Kessen (Decisive Battle for Okinawa), first published in Japanese in 1973, was an account of his first-hand experience directing Japanese operations on Okinawa during the invasion.
He died in 1981.

The Executive of the 6th Northern Ireland Assembly was appointed on 11 January 2020, after the confirmation of Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill as First and deputy First Ministers.
Following the 2 March 2017 elections to the sixth Northern Ireland Assembly, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Féin remained the two largest parties in the Assembly. Parties in Northern Ireland that were eligible to join the Northern Ireland Executive were given a deadline of 27 March 2017 to form an Executive. The deadline passed and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire passed an emergency law at Westminster to allow more time for talks to take place. Brokenshire threatened direct rule if no agreement was reached by early May 2017. This deadline was later extended to 29 June after Prime Minister, Theresa May's decision to call a snap general election for 8 June 2017.
On 29 June 2017, the DUP and Sinn Féin had both announced that they had not come to an agreement to form the next Northern Ireland Executive. Brokenshire extended the deadline until 3 July 2017 for further talks to continue. Abortive talks continued intermittently through 2017, 2018 and 2019 but were overshadowed by the UK Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and the DUP role in supporting the minority British Government. Intensive talks resumed in December 2019 following the 2019 UK General Election with a new deadline of 13 January 2020 for fresh assembly elections set by Secretary of State Julian Smith. An agreement was published by the two governments on 9 January 2020 and it was accepted by the leading parties.
The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and Alliance Party of Northern Ireland returned to the Executive, having been absent since 2016; Alliance's Naomi Long obtained the cross-community vote to become Minister for Justice.

Orelyak () is a nature reserve in the central section of the Pirin mountain range in south-western Bulgaria. It is situated in Gotse Delchev Municipality, Blagoevgrad Province. It was declared on 22 February 1985 to protect old growth beech forests it the vicinities of Mount Orelyak (2,099 m), the highest summit in Central Pirin. It spans a territory of 757 ha or 7.57 km2.
Geographic overview
The border of the reserve follows the main mountain ridge to the north of Mount Orelayk; the ridge itself is within the reserve's buffer zone. The easternmost section is situated in the valley of the Lazhnichka river, a tributary to the Marevo river. Orelyak reserve is situated at an altitude between 900 m and 1800 m. The rock base is formed of marbles. The climate is continental Mediterranean and Alpine at higher altitude.
Flora
The forests of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) are of the greatest conservation importance. Their average age is over 150 years and despite being old growth, the forests have remained extremely dense. In the lower parts of the reserve the beech forests have been replaced by the other deciduous trees like European hop-hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia) and South European flowering ash (Fraxinus ornus). In the western sections at about 1700 m altitude there are also small patches of Macedonian pine (Pinus peuce).
Orelyak reserve is home to a number Bulgarian and Balkan endemic herbaceous species, including Pirin tea (Sideritis scardica), Draba scardica, Achillea chrysocoma, Saxifraga ferdinandi-coburgi, Viola grisebachiana, Polygala rhodopaea, Arabis ferdinandi-coburgii, Thymus perinicus, etc.
Fauna
Despite the small territory of the reserve, the fauna is diverse. Typical animals include brown bear, gray wolf, red fox, wild boar, roe deer, Greek stream frog, fire salamander, etc.

Miles Davis Volume 1 refers to two separate but related entities. The title was originally used for the first time in a pair of compilation albums of recordings made by Miles Davis in 1952, 1953 and 1954, released in 1956 (and reissued many times) as BLP 1501 on the Blue Note Records label.
Miles Davis Volume 1 also refers to a CD compilation that contains the entirety of Young Man with a Horn (BLP 5013, 1951) plus three alternate takes, plus the entirety of Miles Davis, Vol. 3 (BLP 5040, 1954), both released on 10-inch LP.
The album was identified by Scott Yanow in his Allmusic essay "Hard Bop" in 2010 as one of the 17 Essential Hard Bop Recordings.
Release history
The 12-inch LP (BLP 1501) was originally released in January 1956, followed by Volume 2 (BLP 1502), after Davis won the Down Beat readers poll as best trumpeter. The two volumes of rereleased Miles Davis material were the first releases in Blue Note's new 1500 series of 12"LPs. The music compiled on the two volumes was from three separate recording sessions made over 1952–54, some of which had been previously issued as singles, and as three now discontinued 10-inch LPs. Volume 1 contained takes of the May 9, 1952 and April 20, 1953 sessions for the label, including alternate takes of some songs. The master takes had originally been issued in 10"LP formats under the titles Young Man with a Horn (BLP 5013), and Miles Davis Volume 2 (BLP 5022). The original BLP 1501 running order is available on some Japanese CD versions and from HDTracks.
The 1988 CD edition (Blue Note CDP 7 81501 2) reused the cover from BLP 1501, but had different content. The CD compiled the entire tracks recorded on May 9, 1952, and March 6, 1954, whereas the complete 1953 session is now on Miles Davis Volume 2. By appending the alternate takes directly after master takes, of the initial 10-inch release Young Man with a Horn, it did not maintain the original order of the historic record.
The 2001 CD edition (7243 5 32610 2 3) used new cover art based on 1954's Volume 3, and was remastered by Rudy Van Gelder. Like the 1988 version, it contained the entire 1952 and 1954 sessions, but with alternates following the original running order of BLP 5013.

Andrew Joseph McDonald (October 24, 1923 – April 1, 2014) was an American prelate of the Catholic Church. He served as Bishop of Little Rock from 1972 to 2000. He spent his retirement at the St. Joseph Home for the Elderly in Palatine, Illinois, and died there on April 1, 2014.
Biography
The second youngest of 12 children, McDonald was born in Savannah, Georgia to James Bernard and Theresa (née McGrael) McDonald. After graduating from Marist School for Boys, he studied at St. Charles College in Catonsville, Maryland and at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, from where he obtained a Licentiate of Sacred Theology (1948).
McDonald was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Emmet M. Walsh on May 8, 1948. He then furthered his studies at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. and at the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome, there earning a Doctorate in Canon Law in 1951. Upon his return to the United States, he became chancellor of the Diocese of Savannah, official of the Diocesan Marriage Tribunal, and curate of Port Wentworth. He was named a Papal Chamberlain in 1956 and a Domestic Prelate in 1959. From 1963 to 1972 he served as pastor of Blessed Sacrament Church; during this time, he was also named vicar general of the diocese in 1967.
On July 4, 1972 McDonald was appointed the fifth Bishop of Little Rock, Arkansas, by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 5 from Archbishop Thomas McDonough, with Archbishop Philip Hannan and Bishop Gerard Frey serving as co-consecrators. He was formally installed as Bishop two days later, on September 7.
Unlike his predecessor, Albert Fletcher, McDonald followed the suggestion of the Second Vatican Council in instituting permanent deacons in Little Rock, largely because of the diocese's shortage of priests. McDonald was opposed to the Supreme Court's 1973 legalization of abortion in Roe v. Wade; he later established an anti-abortion office in the diocesan curia and led the annual March for Life each January in Little Rock. In 1982, he invited Mother Teresa to open a home for single mothers in Little Rock.
A dedicated ecumenist, McDonald reached out to other denominations in Arkansas throughout his tenure, and once assisted in promoting a Billy Graham crusade at War Memorial Stadium in 1989. A year later, in 1990, he condemned the legal execution of John Edward Swindler, Arkansas's first execution in more than twenty-five years.
He also became known for his affable personality, his involvement with the laity, and his personal interest in those Catholics under his jurisdiction. After twenty-seven years of service, he retired as Little Rock's ordinary on January 4, 2000. Afterwards, McDonald lived outside of Chicago, Illinois, where he served as chaplain for the Little Sisters of the Poor.

Florence Eleanor Booth (née Soper; 12 September 1861 – 10 June 1957) was the wife of Bramwell Booth, Second General of The Salvation Army.
Early life
Born in Blaina, Monmouthshire, she was the eldest daughter of Dr Isabell Hawker Soper, a Plymouth physician, and his wife, Jane Eleanor (née Levick), and had a sister Evelyn Mary and a brother Frederick. Her mother died in 1870 when she was nine years old. She was a gifted girl fond of reading and music and also had a secret ambition to become a doctor.
The Salvation Army
Florence had just passed her last school examination and was visiting her two aunts in London when she converted at a Whitechapel meeting she had attended as a sightseer. Here she heard Catherine Booth speak and made the decision to follow Christ and learn more about The Salvation Army. She became friendly with the Booth family including their son Bramwell. After making the decision to join the Army, by 1881 she had been promoted to Lieutenant and in that year went with the Booth's eldest daughter Catherine to begin the Salvation Army's work in France. It was at this time that Bramwell asked her to marry him. As she was not yet 21 her father was against the marriage, but finally, on 12 October 1882, Captain Florence Soper married Chief of the Staff Bramwell Booth at Clapton Congress Hall before a crowd of 6,000 Salvationists, who were charged 1 shilling each to attend, the money being used to purchase the notorious "Eagle Tavern" public house. The wedding ceremony was performed by General Booth. In 1912, on the death of his father, Bramwell Booth was to become the second General of The Salvation Army.
The Women's Social Work
Life for women in the early 1880s was difficult. Jobs were scarce, and prostitution was rampant. Girls as young as 13 were selling themselves or being sold for money. When Florence Booth, a pioneer of The Salvation Army's social work for women, caught wind of this travesty she knew The Salvation Army needed to do something. She and her husband, Bramwell Booth, were moved as they walked the streets of London and saw the desperation and despair. Florence championed the cause and helped bring social reform.
In 1884 Florence inaugurated The Women's Social Work which was run from a small house in Hanbury Street, in Whitechapel, London.
She was young, delicate, refined; her remarkable powers of grasp and administration had not been developed at this time; she was typical of the well-educated, rather shrinking and self-conscious girl of the English professional classes — perhaps the last person in the world to whom any one would have thought of committing so hazardous and dreadful a business as this rescuing of fallen women. But she was moved by her husband's appeal, and, in spite of some doubt on William Booth's part, was appointed to take charge of the Salvation Army's first Rescue Home.
She continued to lead this pioneering aspect of The Salvation Army's work for the next 28 years, until Bramwell became General.
One of the tangible ways The Salvation Army helped these destitute women was by opening homes for women in the hopes they would not have to turn to prostitution and providing a safe haven for those who were already suffering from the trade. Many of the residents were young, expectant mothers. Realizing the need for additional care for pregnant women, The Salvation Army opened rescue homes across the globe.
Family life
Florence and Bramwell Booth had five daughters and two sons: Catherine (1883-1987), Mary B. (1885-1969), Florence Miriam (1887-1917), Olive Emma (1891-1989), Dora (1893-1989), Bramwell Bernard (1889-1984) and William Wycliffe (1895-1975).
On her death in 1957, Florence Soper Booth was buried with Bramwell Booth at Abney Park Cemetery.

Dubautia plantaginea is a rare species of flowering plant in the aster family known by the common name plantainleaf dubautia. It is endemic to Hawaii where it is the only member of the silversword alliance that is found on all six of the largest islands (Kaua'i, O'ahu, Moloka'i, Lana'i, Maui, Hawai'i). Two of the three subspecies are rare and endangered. Like other Dubautia this plant is called na`ena`e.
This plant varies in morphology, taking the form of a small shrub to a tree up to 7 meters tall. There are three subspecies. The dwarf subspecies, ssp. humilis, is endemic to Maui, where there is only one population consisting of about 50 plants. This subspecies was federally listed as an endangered species in 1999. The ssp. magnifolia is a shrub or a tree which is endemic to Kaua'i, where there are no more than 2 populations remaining. It was listed as endangered in 2010.
These plants grow in moist and wet forest habitat with 75 to over 700 centimeters of precipitation annually.
Threats to this species and its habitat include landslides, rockslides, erosion, flooding, and invasive plant species such as Hilo grass (Paspalum conjugatum). The ssp. magnifolia was decimated by Hurricane Iniki in 1992.

Shenley Brook End is a village, district and wider civil parish in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. Together with its neighbouring districts of Shenley Church End, Shenley Wood and Shenley Lodge, the districts are collectively known as "The Shenleys".
Today, the historic village is the core of the new district that bears its name. The district is bounded by V2 Tattenhoe Street, V3 Fulmer Street, H6 Childs Way and H7 Chaffron Way.
The mathematician and logician Alan Turing was billeted here during his time at Bletchley Park.
History
The village name 'Shenley' is an Old English language word meaning 'bright clearing'. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the area was collectively known as Senelai.
The distinction between the Brook End and the Church End happened in the 12th century when a new manor house was constructed in Shenley Brook End by the Mansell family. However, by 1426 the two manors were owned by the same person and the distinction between the two places was in name only.
Education
It has primary school, Long Meadow, and a secondary school, Shenley Brook End School, in 2007 one of the best performing schools in Milton Keynes.
Civil parish
The parish includes Shenley Lodge, Furzton, Shenley Brook End, Emerson Valley, Westcroft, Tattenhoe (including Kingsmead, Howe Park Wood and Snelshall East) and Tattenhoe Park (including Snelshall West). The parish is bounded to the north-east by V4 Watling Street, to the north-west by H6 Childs Way, to the south-west by the City boundary with the rest of Buckinghamshire (at Whaddon) and to the south-east by H8/A421 Standing Way.
Emerson Valley
Emerson Valley is primarily a housing district but is noted for being the home of Milton Keynes Rugby Football Club. It is also the name of an electoral ward for Milton Keynes City Council.
Furzton
Furzton is primarily a housing district with a small office development but half the district is taken up by Furzton Lake (a balancing lake) and the flood plain of Loughton Brook.
Shenley Lodge
Shenley Lodge is a residential district, noted for the Energy World development of exemplar high-energy-efficiency houses in 1986.
Snelshall and Kingsmead
These two grid squares are in the far south-west of Milton Keynes, abutting the boundary with Whaddon parish. They are primarily residential, with an industrial area south of the brook. The notable feature of the district is the site of the ruined Snelshall Priory, a ruined Benedictine priory founded in about 1200.
Tattenhoe and Tattenhoe Park
These districts share the Tattenhoe grid square and are primarily residential.
Westcroft
A large fraction of Westcroft is taken by the District Centre of the same name. It is a large retail development that serves the west side of Milton Keynes. The rest of the district is residential.
Shenley Brook
The brook rises near the site of Snelshall Priory, flows through Furzton where it is joined by a tributary from Emerson Valley, then goes on to become the "tear-drop lakes" in Loughton and flows into the river Great Ouse at New Bradwell.

Meliton Varlamis dze Kantaria or Kantariya (, ; 5 October 1920 – 27 December 1993) was a Georgian sergeant of the Soviet Army credited with having hoisted a Soviet flag over the Reichstag on 30 April 1945, together with Mikhail Yegorov and Aleksey Berest.
Biography
Born to a peasant family in a small Georgian town of Jvari, he worked in a kolkhoz until being mobilized in the Red Army in 1940. During World War II, he served in the 756th Rifle Regiment, 150th Rifle Division, of the 3rd Shock Army at the 1st Belorussian Front. He is credited for having mounted a red banner, together with Sergeant M.A. Yegorov, over the Reichstag on 1 May 1945.
Post-war
Demobilized in 1946, he lived thereafter in Sukhumi working as a governmental shop manager. He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1947. He lived in the city of Ochamchire, and later became a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Georgian SSR. In 1965, together with Yegorov and Konstantin Samsonov, he carried the Victory Banner at the Moscow Victory Day Parade on Red Square. In the same formation, they carried the banner at the International Workers' Day demonstration in 1970. A year after the secessionist war in Abkhazia started, during which Kantaria's house in Ochamchira was destroyed, he moved with his family to Moscow, where he later died two months later in December 1993 in a Moscow hospital. In early January 1994, Kantaria was reburied in his native town Jvari, on the grounds of School #3.
Legacy
In 2010 on Poklonnaya Hill, a memorial was opened dedicated to Yegorov and Kantaria. Modern day Georgia holds Kantaria in high historical regard, being one of few whose Soviet era legacy was rehabilitated. Since 2011, the school where he has been buried has been named after Kantaria. It was renamed by President of Georgia Mikhail Saakashvili during that year's Victory Day celebrations, during which he noted that Kantaria "is probably the most classic example of the tragic fate of our people, since he ended his life as a refugee". A bust of Kantaria was unveiled installed in Tbilisi's Kikvidze Park at the initiative of the veteran organization "Heirs of Victory" in 2016.

Denmark–Eritrea relations refers to the current and historical relations between Denmark and Eritrea. Denmark is represented in Eritrea through its embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, and Eritrea is represented in Denmark through its embassy in Stockholm, Sweden. Diplomatic relations were established in 1993. Relations between Denmark and Eritrea have been bad, since Denmark decided to suspend development cooperation with Eritrea in January 2002, and close its embassy in June 2002. After the Eritrean–Ethiopian War from 1998 to 2000, Denmark sent 320 soldiers to the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea to monitor a ceasefire in the border war.
History
In 1950, Denmark and 15 other countries voted for a united Eritrea and Ethiopia under Haile Selassie in the United Nations. During the Eritrean War of Independence, Denmark sent humanitarian assistance to the Eritrean People's Liberation Front. In the 1980s, the parliament of Denmark passed a resolution supporting the independence in Eritrea.
Denmark opened an embassy in Asmara in July 1997, but closed it in June 2002, because of the lack of democracy in the country. In October 2001, Eritrea expelled the Italian ambassador, and later Denmark recalled its ambassador to Eritrea for consultations. In 2001, Denmark ended aid to Eritrea because of the arrest of Eritrean students and opposition politicians by President Isaias Afewerki, and the lack of freedom of the press in Eritrea. Another reason was the new liberal government of Denmark, that decided to reduce the aid budget.
Development assistance
Eritrea was chosen as a Danish programme country from 1993 to 1996, and again from 1999 to 2001. Denmark has been supporting Eritrea with counteracting land degradation. In 1996, Denmark contributed $35,000 through United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and in 1997, $111,000 through United Nations Truce Supervision Organization to Eritrea. In 1996, Denmark assisted 112 million DKK to the agriculture sector, and 80 million DKK to the education sector. The total aid to the Eritrean agricultural programme amounted 112 million DKK. (US$15 million) From 2001 to 2004, Denmark assisted Eritrea 36.60 million DKK for the justice sector. In 2001, both countries agreed to develop the legal sector. In 2001, Denmark donated $2.199 million to support the clearance of landmines in Eritrea.
High level visits
In the 2000 Arab League summit in Cairo, Eritrean President Isayas Afewerki met Prince Frederik and called the relationship between Denmark and Eritrea "exemplary".
In February 2001, Danish Foreign Minister Mogens Lykketoft visited Eritrea, to discuss development programmes between Denmark and Eritrea.

Thurloe Square is a traditional garden square in South Kensington, London, England.
There are private communal gardens in the centre of the square for use by the local residents. The Victoria and Albert Museum is close by to the north across Thurloe Place and Cromwell Gardens. The nearest tube station is South Kensington to the west along Thurloe Street.
The square (and the adjacent streets) are named after John Thurloe, an advisor of Oliver Cromwell, who owned the land in the 17th century. His descendant, Harris Brace, had a godson called John Alexander, who developed the area in the 1820s. George Basevi designed most of the houses.
Sir Henry Cole (1808–1892), the first director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, lived at 33 Thurloe Square just opposite the museum. The building is marked with a blue plaque and is now the Kazakhstan Embassy.
The house at 5 Thurloe Square is very narrow, wedge-shaped, and only six feet wide at one end.
The homeopath Margery Blackie lived and practised at no. 18 from 1929 to 1980. The building is marked with a blue plaque.
The Yalta Memorial Garden, which contains a memorial to those repatriated as a result of the Yalta Conference following World War II, Twelve Responses to Tragedy, is situated at the north of the square between the square and the Cromwell Road.

No-knead bread is a method of bread baking that uses a very long fermentation (rising) time instead of kneading to form the gluten strands that give the bread its texture. It is characterized by a low yeast content and a very wet dough. Some recipes improve the quality of the crust by baking the bread in a Dutch oven or other covered vessel.
Method
According to one version of the method developed by New York baker Jim Lahey, as described in his book My Bread, one loaf of the bread is made by mixing 400 g (approximately 3 cups) bread flour, 8 g (approximately 1¼ teaspoons) salt and 1 g (approximately ¼ teaspoon) instant yeast with 300 mL (approximately 1 1/3 cups) cool water to produce a 75% hydration dough.

The dough is allowed to rise, covered, for 12 to 18 hours until doubled in size and covered with bubbles, then scraped onto a floured surface, given a few folds, shaped, then allowed to rise, covered, for another hour or two. It is then dropped in a pot that has been preheated in an oven at . The bread is baked in the covered pot for 30 minutes and, with the lid removed, for another 15 to 30 minutes until the crust is a deep brown, then removed from the pot and allowed to cool for an hour.
The method uses a long rise instead of kneading to align the dough's gluten molecules with each other so as to produce a strong, elastic network, resulting in long, sticky strands. The automatic alignment is possible because of the wetness of the dough, which makes the molecules more mobile. Wet doughs, which use a water weight of about 75% that of the flour (hydration), require more salt than conventional doughs, about 2% of the flour weight.
History and popularization
No-knead bread is as old as flour and beer. Written references date as far back as The Compleat Housewife by Eliza Smith (1739).
No-knead bread became widely known to British home-bakers when British nutritionist and food writer Doris Grant (25 January 1905 – 27 February 2003) promoted wholemeal no-knead bread in her wartime book "Your Daily Bread" published in 1944 by Faber & Faber.
Gospel composer and song collector Albert E. Brumley published a recipe for "No-Knead Bread" in his 1972 song collection and cookbook, All-Day Singin' and Dinner on the Ground. Author Jeff Hertzberg notes a method before the late 1990s in Italy.
A no-knead bread was popularized in the 1999 cookbook No Need to Knead, written by California baker Suzanne Dunaway, published by Hyperion Books, and re-published in 2012
Revivals of no-knead breads continue, and the earlier history is often overlooked. In 2007, Hertzberg and fellow author Zoe François published Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day, which uses a no-knead method of stored and refrigerated dough that is ready for use at any time during a 5- to 14-day period. New York Times food columnist Mark Bittman described Lahey's method in his November 8, 2006 column The Minimalist. Bittman praised the bread for its "great crumb, lightness, incredible flavor [and] enviable, crackling crust." Two years later, he noted the recipe's "immediate and wild popularity," and a 2009 cookbook described Bittman's column as "one of those recipes that literally change the culinary scene with discussions on hundreds of blogs in dozens of languages around the world."

Tomorrow is a novel by Graham Swift first published in 2007 about the impending disclosure of a family secret. Set in Putney, London on the night of Friday, 16 June 1995, the novel takes the form of an interior monologue by a 49-year-old mother addressed to her sleeping teenage children. It takes her a few hours—from late at night until dawn—to collect her thoughts and rehearse what she and her husband, who is asleep next to her, are going to tell their son and daughter on the following morning, which for the latter will amount to a rewriting of the family history reaching back as far as 1944. The family narrative completed, the novel ends in the early hours of Saturday, 17 June 1995, before anybody has stirred.
Plot summary
Mike Hook is a wartime child. His father, "Grandpa Pete," and his mother, "Grandma Helen," both hardly turned 20, hastily get married in 1944 just before Pete rejoins the RAF to fight in the Second World War. He is shot down over Germany, survives, and spends several months in a prisoner-of-war camp. In January 1945, while he is still away from home, his son Mike is born.
After the war and his safe return to England, Pete becomes a successful entrepreneur. Mike, who remains an only child, develops an interest in nature quite early in life and eventually, in the 1960s, decides to read Biology at the recently opened University of Sussex. There, in 1966, he meets Paula Campbell, who has come from London to study English Literature and Art, and their relationship soon turns out to be much more than just a fling.
Paula is the only child of a divorced High Court judge with Scottish roots. That man, "Grandpa Dougie," born shortly after the turn of the century, contributes to the war effort by deciphering code somewhere in the English countryside. There, already in his mid-forties, he falls for Fiona McKay, a young secretary with pretty legs who is twenty years his junior, and marries her. Paula, also born in 1945, is sent to a girls' boarding school. Already during her years at school Paula feels her father's growing estrangement from his wife, a development which culminates in divorce and "Grandma Fiona" running off with a man her own age "dripping with some kind of oil-derived, Texan-Aberdonian wealth". After that, Paula hardly ever sees or talks to her own mother again. Just as Mike, she remains an only child. After finishing school, she decides to go on to Sussex University.
In tune with the spirit of the age, both Mike and Paula adopt a promiscuous lifestyle during their student days. However, they realise immediately after their first meeting that they are meant for each other and, deeply in love, decide to become monogamous and to spend the rest of their lives together. They get married in 1970 at the age of 25 and gradually start pursuing their respective careers—Mike as the editor of a struggling science journal, Paula as an art dealer.
In 1972, Paula eventually goes off the pill as they both wish to have children. When Paula does not become pregnant, the couple decide to have themselves tested:
[...] We looked sadly and sympathetically at each other, as if one of us might have to choose, heads or tails, and one of us might have to lose. At this stage we still hoped.
But I have to say—and you must both be starting to muster an intense interest—that this was, in all we'd known so far, the worst moment of our lives. Little war babies to whom nothing especially dreadful, let alone warlike, had happened. The divorce of your parents, the death of an uncle—these things, for God's sake, aren't the end of the world. But this little crisis, even before we knew it was insuperable, was like a not so small end of the world. In one, strictly procreative sense, it might be exactly that. [...]
It was a blow, my darlings, a true blow. And where it truly hurts. It turned out there was a problem and that the problem was your dad's, not mine. [...]
Mike's diagnosed infertility prompts them to remain childless (rather than try to adopt children) and to stay together, Paula suppressing the biological urge to procreate and look for a different partner. However, they decide not to inform anybody of the new situation, not even their own parents, who in turn never broach so delicate a subject with their children and just wait passively for the big announcement. In the meantime, when a neighbour offers them a cat they take her up on it and call him Otis, after recently deceased Otis Redding. Otis becomes the focal point of their married life, so much so that when Paula takes him to the vet she is bluntly told that Otis is their "child substitute".
The vet becomes Paula's confidant (and lover, but just for one night), and he advises her to reconsider her abandoned wish to have a child while pointing her to the options available to her through the fledgling field of reproductive medicine. In the end Mike and Paula make up their minds to give it a try, Paula is artificially inseminated, and in 1979, after her own father's and Otis's death, gives birth to twins whom they christen Nick and Kate. Again, they do not tell anybody about how their children were conceived, especially not that their natural father is "Mr S", an anonymous sperm donor.
As the new day is dawning, sleepless Paula is aware of the fact that the biggest revelation yet in the lives of her two children is imminent. She also makes a mental note to explain to them that they should decide wisely whether to tell anybody the news or not as the implications would be far-reaching: Grandma Helen, for one, might feel cheated out of her grandchildren. On the other hand, Paula can well imagine that her mother-in-law, by sheer maternal instinct, has known about their secret all along.
Reviews
Tomorrow was released in the spring of 2007 to mostly unfavourable reviews. In particular, critics noted that Swift had employed a narrative technique similar to that of his successful 2003 novel, The Light of Day, but that the Fabula and syuzhet of Tomorrow did not lend itself to the kind of narrative used by Swift.
For example, Adam Mars-Jones focuses on Swift's holding back vital information from the reader so that at any given point in the novel they want to know "not what will happen next but what has happened in the first place". This, Mars-Jones argues, worked very well in The Light of Day but fails utterly in Tomorrow: "If you're going to withhold a secret for many pages, it had better deliver a frisson when it comes. In practice this means that it must concern sex or death, and preferably both." However, "the secret is ordinary and wouldn't merit airtime on the most timidly confrontational reality show."
What is more, Mars-Jones detects a cruel streak in Paula, something which was obviously not intended by Swift. No loving mother would keep her almost grown-up children in the dark for 150 pages (the equivalent of several hours of continual talk full of foreboding) and only then divulge the real reason for their unusual meeting: "This would be a sadistic scenario if it was possible to take it seriously. The disproportion between the slim story and its overcontrolled telling is [...] on a par with buying a tank to mow the lawn."
Lionel Shriver, who has "never had the privilege of reviewing a Graham Swift novel before, and I'm a fan", admits that "now I finally get my mitts on a Swift, and I hate it." About the character of Paula, Shriver deplores that the "apologetic, alternatingly gushy and beseeching style seems artificially female—like a man's idea of a woman's voice. This is disconcerting, since Swift has crafted persuasive female characters before. But Paula is female with such a vengeance that she borders on parody. This woman is dull, trying, and signally incapable of ponying up the sharp lines and insightful asides that make a novel enjoyable along the way. Maybe we should let her keep her secret."
In the same vein, Carol Birch, calling the book "a disappointment," notes that Tomorrow "hangs on the device of a secret about to be disclosed, blazed before us from the outset as potentially life-shattering, and trailed like a banner. When it comes, the revelation feels a bit of a cheat: what you'd guessed at, only dismissed as too obvious." As we are told by Paula at one point in the novel that her husband Mike is "like a man finding it in him to sleep on the eve of his execution", Birch surmises that "perhaps he sleeps so soundly because there really is nothing too much to worry about."
Birch claims that teenage children would wince at the kind of confession Paula is about to make: "It's toe-curling, too, when she regales them with how wonderful sex is for her and their dad. 'I have to confess it, a great lust for your father, for your father's body,' for this man with whom 'I made the tenderest of the sweetest love just two hours ago.' Believe me, Paula, your 16-year-olds don't wish to know this."
Only Anne Enright goes a step further and says that, once the secret is out of the bag, "we are free to stop guessing and start enjoying the novel's more delicate truths" as the book "weaves and undoes its quiet magic, making and scattering different kinds of 'family' [...] This is part of Swift's overwhelming honesty as a writer: he writes the way that life goes. He describes a married couple who are well off, content in their working lives and still ardent in bed. The world must contain many such people, though fiction does not—as though happiness were the most inadmissible secret of all."
John Crace has condensed the novel into 700 words in his column, "The Digested Read" ("The digested read, digested: Either she takes the Mogadon or I do.").

Ectemnius is a genus of wasps in the family Crabronidae. 188 species are known.
The genus is found around the world but Australia has only two species.
Ectemnius species excavate nest tunnels in pieces of dead wood such as stumps, fallen tree trunks, rotting logs and sometimes building timbers or posts with the help of the mandibles. Nesting aggregations can be large and dense, and sometimes more than one female has been recorded using a common nest entrance. In most species the brood is supplied with Diptera from several different families.

James Rouget (15 April 1866 – 10 June 1924) was an Australian politician.
He was born in Yering to farmer John Rouget and Susan Le Page, both of whom were from Guernsey. He grew up in Wandin and became an orchardist, and on 28 November 1894 married Anne Blanksby, with whom he had seven children. He later worked as a secretary at the Evelyn Preserving Company, rising to the position of general manager. He served on Lillydale Shire Council from 1901 to 1922, with three terms as president (1906–1907, 1909–1910, 1918–1919). In 1914 he was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as the member for Evelyn, but he was defeated at the next election in 1917. He moved to St Kilda in 1922 to become a valuator, but he died in Murrumbeena in 1924.

The 29th Aviation Division (Serbo-Croatian: 29. vazduhoplovna divizija/ 29. ваздухопловна дивизија) was a unit originally established in 1944 as the 11th Aviation Fighter Division (Serbo-Croatian: 11. vazduhoplovna lovačka divizija / 11. ваздухопловна ловачка дивизија). It was formed from Yugoslav partisan aviators, trained and equipped by the Soviet Air Force.
History
11th Aviation Fighter Division
The 11th Aviation Fighter Division was established on December 29, 1944, in Novi Sad, from Yugoslav partisan aviators with the Soviet Air Force 17th Air Army's 236th Fighter Aviation Division (236.IAD). It has become independent form Soviet command and personal since May 1945. Division was part of Group of Aviation Divisions, and it consisted from three fighter regiments. Its regiments took part in final operations for liberation of Yugoslavia. During the combat operations its headquarters was at Ruma.
Division has about 987 personal, 112 officers, 250 NCO's and 625 soldiers. From that number 136 were pilots, and 647 were from technical service. It was armed with 115 Yak-1 fighter aircraft.
By the August 1945 the division was reorganized and renamed to 1st Aviation Mixed Division (Serbo-Croatian: 1. vazduhoplovna mešovita divizija/ 1. ваздухопловна мешовита дивизија).
The commander of division in this period was Arsenije Boljević and commissars was Ljubiša Čurguz.
1st Aviation Division
The 1st Aviation Mixed Division was formed by order from August 3, 1945, from 11th Aviation Fighter Division with headquarters at Skoplje. The division was direct under the Command of Yugoslav Air Force. In 1947 headquarters was dislocated from Skoplje to Niš been and division was renamed in to 1st Aviation Assault Division (Serbo-Croatian: 1. vazduhoplovna jurišna divizija/ 1. ваздухопловна јуришна дивизија). It has remained with only one regiment under its command.
By the 1948 year this division was renamed like all other units of Yugoslav Army, so it has become 29th Assault Aviation Division (Serbo-Croatian: 29. vazduhoplovna jurišna divizija/ 29. ваздухопловна јуришна дивизија).
The commanders of division in this period were Arsenije Boljević, Mirko Šćepanović and Ilija Zelenika. Commissars were Ljubiša Čurguz and Dragoman Radojčić.
29th Aviation Division
The 29th Aviation Assault Division was formed by renaming of 1st Aviation Assault Division in 1948. It was reorganized to have again under his command three regiments.
In 1953 division was attached to 7th Aviation Corps. It was also renamed as an Aviation Fighter-Bomber Division due to the replacement of Soviet assault aircraft with US-made fighter-bombers.
It was disbanded by the order from June 27, 1959 per the "Drvar" reorganization plan. Its units were attached to 3rd Air Command.
The commanders of division in this period were Ilija Zelenika and Enver Ćemalović. Commissar was Dragoman Radojčić until 1953.

USS Cambria (APA-36) was a Bayfield-class attack transport acquired by the U.S. Navy for service in World War II. She was named after Cambria County, Pennsylvania
Cambria was launched 10 November 1942 as SS Sea Swallow by the Western Pipe and Steel Company, San Francisco, California, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. W. Griffin; acquired by the Navy 4 May 1943; placed in partial commission the same day, Lieutenant Commander William S. Baker USN, in command; sailed to New York for decommissioning and conversion to an attack transport; and recommissioned 10 November 1943.
USS Cambria was taken out of service in 1970.
World War II Pacific Theatre operations
Invasion of the Marshall Islands
Cambria departed Norfolk, Virginia, 11 December 1943 and arrived at Pearl Harbor on New Year's Day. After three weeks of intensive training, she sailed on 23 January 1944 for the invasion of the Marshall Islands, where she served as flagship for Majuro Attack Group during the landings.
Invasion of Saipan
After overhaul at San Francisco, California, and refresher training at Pearl Harbor, Cambria left 30 May 1944 for the Marianas invasion, again serving as flagship of an attack group. She took part in the assault on Saipan which began 15 June and during the next 24 days embarked 715 casualties of the desperate fighting on the island. Flying the flag of Commander task force TF 52, she led the invasion of Tinian (24 July-1 August); here she handled another 613 casualties.
Invasion of Leyte
Embarking U.S. Army troops and equipment at Honolulu, Cambria got underway 15 September 1944 for Manus, arriving 3 October to join the Southern Attack Group for the invasion of the Philippines. On 20 October she landed troops at Dulag, Leyte, in the first assault wave, then remained off Leyte as a casualty evacuation ship, receiving 70 wounded from the beach. Cambria lifted reinforcements from Oro Bay, New Guinea, to the Leyte area, then returned to New Guinea for rehearsal landings at Huon Gulf.
Invasion of Lingayen Gulf
Cambria landed troops at Lingayen Gulf during the invasion landings 10 January 1945, and after a reinforcement mission from San Pedro Bay to Lingayen Gulf, got underway for Tulagi, Florida Island, to train for the invasion of Okinawa.
Invasion of Okinawa
Cambria staged at Ulithi, then put her troops ashore at Okinawa on 1 April 1945. She completed her unloading two days later and sailed for San Pedro, California, arriving 3 May for an overhaul which lasted until the end of hostilities.
After hostilities
For the remainder of the year she was engaged in the redeployment of forces in the Far East, and then as a participant in the giant Magic Carpet operation which brought back demobilizing troops to the United States. Before returning to the U.S., the ship transported men from the 2nd Marine Division to Nagasaki, Japan, where it anchored 28 Sept.-Oct. 5, 1945. She departed Nagasaki on 5 October 1945 and picked up soldiers in Manila, Shanghai and Okinawa before returning to the U.S.
Post-World War II operations
Sailing from San Francisco, California, 11 January 1946, Cambria arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on the 27th for duty with the Atlantic Fleet. She received a new commanding officer, Captain Edward L. Woodyard, in February. She operated from her new home port on local exercises and training assaults in the Caribbean until placed out of commission in reserve 30 June 1949.
Suez crisis
Recommissioned 15 September 1950 with the outbreak of war in Korea, Cambria, alternated local operations and training in the Caribbean and off Labrador with three tours of duty with the U.S. 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. On her 1956 cruise with the 6th Fleet "Cambria" landed United Nations troops at Gaza during the Suez crisis.
Beirut mission
Returning to Norfolk 2 February 1957, Cambria resumed operations and exercises in the Caribbean and along the eastern seaboard. This routine was interrupted in the summer of 1958, when, on 10 September, Cambria sailed to join the 6th Fleet in support of the American landings at Beirut, Lebanon. She remained at this port until 18 October 1958 and in the Mediterranean until the end of the year to complete a regular tour with the 6th Fleet.
She returned to the States in March 1959, visited Great Lakes ports during June and July in connection with the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, and operated on the east coast. Cambria made another 6th Fleet cruise during the first half of 1960, then resumed U.S. East Coast operations for the remainder of the year. She was also involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis from 24 October to 5 December 1962. On 8 July 1969, she was involved in a collision with the during a night-time exercise off Malta.
End of service
Cambria was decommissioned 14 September 1970 and transferred to MARAD on 13 November 1970, and struck from the Naval Vessel Register 1 September 1971. She was sold for non-transportation use on 7 September 1971 to Caribbean Marine, Inc, and scrapped the following year.

Juan de Borja Lanzol (Llançol) de Romaní, el mayor (1446 – August 1, 1503) was the first of ten cardinal-nephews elevated by Pope Alexander VI, the cousin of his father, Galcerán de Borja y Moncada.
Biography
Borja was the son of Galcerán de Borja y Moncada and Tecla Navarro de Alpicat, born in 1446. He was a canon of the cathedral chapter of Valencia and the paborde of Albal as well as a minor cleric.
Pope Sixtus IV, also a relative, made Borja protonotary apostolic and an editor of apostolic letters circa 1408. Pope Innocent VIII made him the Governor of Rome. Borja had an illegitimate son named Galcerán.
He was elected archbishop of Monreale on September 13, 1483, an archdiocese he would never visit but occupy until his death. There is no evidence he was ever ordained a priest or consecrated as bishop. After the papal conclave, 1492, which elected Borja's relative Rodrigo pope as Alexander VI, he was created cardinal-priest of S. Susanna on August 31, 1492.
Borja went on to accumulate benefices and their associated revenues: he became the administrator of the see of Olomouc, Moravia from February 8, 1493, to January 30, 1497. He was named legate a latere to Alfonso II of Naples on April 18, 1494. Borja was named bishop of Ferrara on October 29, 1494, taking possession of the see on June 14, 1497, until his death. He was also the bishop of Melfi from September 19, 1494, until December 3, 1498.
In May 1494, he attended the coronation of Alfonso II of Naples, along with one patriarch, seven archbishops, and forty bishops; Borja himself crowned Alfronso king on May 18. Along with Cesare Borgia and Alexander VI, Juan met with Alfonso on July 12, 1494, in Vicovaro to co-ordinate military strategy against Cardinal Ascanio Sforza (whom Borja would later replace in the office of the Vice-Chancellor in 1500) and his allies as well as Charles VIII of France. He brought Alexander VI's terms of peace to Charles VIII on December 25, 1494, in Bracciano before retreating with the pontiff on January 7, 1495, to the Castel Sant'Angelo (and then on May 27, 1495, to Orvieto) to take refuge from French troops. On April 24, 1503, Borja became the titular Latin Patriarch of Constantinople.

Portrait of John C. Calhoun is a circa 1858 oil on canvas portrait painting by Henry F. Darby, now in United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. It is one of the paintings that possibly suffered damage from tear gas and pepper spray during the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol.
The painting portrays John C. Calhoun, who sat for his photograph in Mathew Brady's studio the year before he died in 1850. This portrait has the inscription on the back ”Calhoun / from Life by Darby / H. F. Darby / 1858”, though the "from Life" must refer to the daguerrotype. Though the photograph was commissioned by Cahoun's daughter Florence Clemson, who accompanied her father to the studio, the painting was commissioned by Brady who considered it one of his prize paintings in his studio. He probably used it to sell both copies of the photograph and as a painted portrait option based on a single sitting. It was purchased from him for the Capitol collection in 1881. Brady said that Henry Darby had made a study for the painting during the sitting for the daguerreotype, but the Senate collection now claims Darby and Brady teamed up by using glass negative copies of the daguerreotypes to project the image onto "sensitized canvas", which could then be over-painted, a reproduction process that didn't need the artist's presence at the sitting. At the time the painting was made, Darby and Brady both had addresses on the same block of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C.
The portrait hangs across from the portrait of Charles Sumner, also based on a Brady photograph. As the man known today for his views on slavery as a positive good in the United States, Calhoun, like his portrait's abolitionist neighbor, would not have approved the confederate flag being flown before his portrait in 2021. According to his Senate address 6 February 1837, he was determined to ward off a possible civil war: "As widely as this incendiary spirit has spread, it has not yet infected this body, or the great mass of the intelligent and business portion of the North; but unless it be speedily stopped, it will spread and work upwards till it brings the two great sections of the Union into deadly conflict. ...Standing at the point of time at which we have now arrived, it will not be more difficult to trace the course of future events now than it was then. They who imagine that the spirit now abroad in the North, will die away of itself without a shock or convulsion, have formed a very inadequate conception of its real character; it will continue to rise and spread, unless prompt and efficient measures to stay its progress be adopted. Already it has taken possession of the pulpit, of the schools, and, to a considerable extent, of the press; those great instruments by which the mind of the rising generation will be formed." Though aware that slavery was morally evil, Calhoun recognized its economic necessity in light of the tariff of 1828 that threatened the Southern states. It was the prospect of destitution for all South Carolinians that caused him to take an extreme position during his South Carolina Exposition and Protest which in turn caused the Nullification crisis. He became a proponent of States' rights as a last resort against civil war, which happened anyway a decade after his death.

Alcohol measurements are units of measurement for determining amounts of beverage alcohol.
Beer measures
Liquor measurements
The following table lists common sizes for liquors and spirits.
Liquor bottles
The British Reputed Pint and Reputed Quart were used in Great Britain and throughout the Empire from the late 17th century until the early 20th century. Originally there were different standard gallons depending on the type of alcohol. That meant that the Reputed measures varied depending on which standard gallon was used. A Reputed Pint of beer was equal to 285 mL (1/2 an Ale Pint, or equivalent to 10 imperial oz. or 9.63 US oz.) and a Reputed Quart of wine was equal to 730 mL (3/4 of a Wine Quart, or equivalent to 25.69 Imp. oz. or 24.68 US fluid oz.). When the Imperial system was adopted in 1824, the fluid gallon was standardized on the old Ale Gallon (which had 160 fluid ounces). However, Reputed pints and quarts were still used by breweries and merchants, but measurements were now based on the Imperial system. There was still confusion about whether Reputed or Imperial measures was being used by the merchant, so eventually Imperial pints and quarts were made standard in the early 20th century.
The United States adopted the British Wine Gallon (which had 128 fluid ounces) as standard. The laws concerning the production and sale of alcohol stated that it had to be sold in portions of a gallon for tax purposes. A standard case of bottled beer, wine or liquor had to be equal to two gallons and bottles came in half-dozens and dozens rather than fourths (quarts) and eighths (pints). There would be 24 small bottles (Twelfths of a US gallon) or 12 large bottles (Sixths of a US gallon) per case. The bottles were later increased in size (Tenths and Fifths of a US gallon) to be equivalent to British Reputed Pints and Quarts, allowing them to be interchangeable for export. The American liquor industry later referred to these measures as "Commercial Pints" (Tenths) and "Commercial Quarts" (Fifths).
Wine measurements
The following table contains various measurements that are commonly applied to wine.
The 750 mL Standard wine bottle was chosen because it was the standard French wine bottle once moulded glass bottles were available in the 19th century. Previously there was a roughly 730 mL limit to glass-blown bottles because that was the limit of a glassblower's lungs. The volume was rounded up to 750 mL and then was used as the base size for French wine containers, with all subdivisions and multiples figured from it. The rest of the world followed suit with equivalent customary measurement versions of their own (like the British Reputed Quart).
Following metrication in 1980, American still wines can also be sold in large multi-liter containers, but only in full liters. They are typically sold in glass demijohns or foil bag-in-box containers holding 4, 5, 7, 8, or 10 Liters.

"U-Digg" is a song by American rappers Lil Baby and 42 Dugg featuring American rapper Veeze. It was released on June 17, 2022 and was produced by Antt Beatz.
Composition
Shawn Grant of The Source described the song as having a "blend of Atlanta and Detroit brings the familiar energy of Baby and Dugg that is previously heard on street classics like 'We Paid.'" In the song, the three rappers "weave within each other", and deliver "boastful" lyrics about "wealth, women and weapons".
Music video
The music video was directed by Lil Baby himself and released alongside the single. It begins with Lil Baby having a phone call. He, 42 Dugg and Veeze then each walk down a staircase with bags of money. Through most of the video, the three are surrounded by Maybachs and Campagna T. rex's, while showing off how much money they have. Lil Baby is also seen riding around in luxury vehicles and "bench pressing" his stacks of money.

The Koenigsegg CC was the prototype for the CC8S sports car made by the Swedish automobile manufacturer Koenigsegg.
Overview
Work on the car started in 1994. Koenigsegg wanted to build a sports car that could exceed the standards set by the McLaren F1 at the time, and achieve speeds over the 386 km/h (240 mph) set by the F1 in 1997. The design of the CC was inspired by the McLaren F1 along with the Ferrari F40. The car, initially painted silver, was then painted black when the new dihedral helix synchro actuation doors were fitted, and finally was painted its current colour. Other two prototypes included the white European spec prototype which was produced in 2000 and the other was a pre-production version of the CC8S. The production version of the CC, the CC8S, was designed in 2002, and was the first car Koenigsegg produced.
The deal with Audi for the use of their 4.2 V8 did fall flat after the car's designer, Christian von Koenigsegg, made clear his intent of tuning the V8 far beyond its standard output. The next candidate was the Flat-12 race engine developed by Motori Moderni for the Scuderia Coloni Formula One team, in which this engine was raced under the Subaru badge in the 1990 season. These Subaru 1235 engines were purchased and modified for use in the CC. This deal failed to materialise when the founder of Motori Modern died, sending the company into bankruptcy. Following a deal was made with Ford for use of the Modular V8.

The National Laboratory Animal Center (NLAC) is a research institute in Taiwan which is part of the National Applied Research Laboratories.
History
The National Laboratory Animal Center was established in 1994 as the first large scale domestic supplier of specific pathogen free (SPF) laboratory rodents. In June 2003 it was brought under the umbrella of the National Applied Research Laboratories. NLAC supports Taiwan's biomedical industry.
In 2015 NLAC succeeded in breeding their first advanced severe immuno deficiency (ASID) mouse which they established a commercial line off of. The mice cost NT$3,000 to produce which was a significant savings over imported mice from the US and Japan which cost between NT$15,000 and NT$30,000.
Facilities
In 2019 NLAC inaugurated a new NT$2 billion (US$64.64 million) research center built in Taipei's National Biotechnology Research Park. As well as being a research center the new facility also serves as a repository for the fertilized eggs of rare mice. As of 2019 the repository held 830,000 fertilized eggs.
NLAC operates a preclinical testing lab at the Hsinchu Biomedical Science Park and a preclinical animal care and surgery facility at the Southern Taiwan Science Park.

The Tower of Hananeel (or Hananel; hanan'e-el, chanan'-el, "El (God) is gracious") is a tower in the walls of Jerusalem, adjoining the Tower of Meah (or Hammeah: "the Tower of the Hundred") to the east connecting to the "sheep gate". It is mentioned in Nehemiah 3:1 and Nehemiah 12:39. It is located on the northern wall section of the old city, near the northeastern corner, a point of the city always requiring special fortification and later the sites successively of the Hasmonean Baris and of the Antonia Fortress.
Biblical accounts
The prophet Jeremiah foretold the rebuilding of Jerusalem:
About 150 years later, the walls of Jerusalem were built again under Nehemiah:
As soon as the walls were ready they had a dedication feast with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.
Zechariah placed this tower as the northern point of Jerusalem in the rebuilding.
Analysis
Based on the description in Nehemiah 3, the tower of Hananeel stood midway between "the sheep gate" and "the fish gate", at the northeast corner of Jerusalem, then from this point, the wall of the city which had run northwestern from the sheep gate now turned to west.
As "Hananeel" (or "Hananel") means "God's grace", Schroeder notes that the Tower of Hananeel “metaphorically designates” the apostles and first believers who were "strengthened like a tower by the grace of the Holy Spirit descending on them on the Day of Pentecost with a visible sign" ().

Hugo F.V. Coveliers (born 21 February 1947) is a retired Belgian politician and lawyer. He was a member of the Belgian Chamber of People's Representatives between 1985 and 1995 and from 1993 to 2003. Since 2003 he has been a member of the Belgian Senate. He was a parliamentary chairman for the VLD in both chambers, from 1999 to 2003.
Biography
Coveliers was born in Schelle, Flemish Community, Belgium, on 21 February 1947. As a student he came into contact with the Flemish Movement. Coveliers became a member of the Young Flemish Student Community and at the University of Ghent he was a member of the Vlaams-Nationale Studentenunie for two years. From his period in the humanities he was involved in the youth section of the People's Union (Volksunie), a Flemish nationalist party, of which he was the chairman from 1974 to 1976. He was also a municipal councilor of Antwerp from 1974 to 1976. From 1976 to 1979, he was chairman of the Volksunie section of the Antwerp district. He later changed to the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD) in 1992 together with some other frustrated party members. Within the VLD, he was part of the conservative wing, and he was open to the idea of working with the Vlaams Belang (Flemish Interest) and its precursor Vlaams Blok (Flemish Bloc), something the VLD's leadership did not support.
In 2004 Coveliers was co-founder of the Antwerp section of the conservative-libertarian organization Nova Civitas and became inspired and influenced by Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn. At that time he also feuded openly with VLD party chairman Karel De Gucht. This resulted in Coveliers being ejected from the party on 8 February 2005, and starting his own political party VLOTT in the fall of 2005 based on Fortuyn's ideas. This party is willing to work together with the Vlaams Belang (VB) and formed a cartel with it for the Antwerp city elections in October 2006.
After the dismissal of Jean-Marie Dedecker from the VLD, Coveliers, Dedecker and Boudewijn Bouckaert (and other Nova Civitas members) started negotiations to form a new right-wing liberal party. Coveliers and members of VLOTT stood on the VB list for the 2007 general election. Coveliers has since became a member of VB.
Coveliers withdrew from active politics early 2012.

Plot

A petty criminal, Cainazzo (Adriano Celentano) and a baker, Romulus (Enzo Cerusico), are involuntarily involved in the movements of that period, the person finding the major contradictions of the time.
Assist – in the midst of idealists and patriots – an exemplary gallery of characters: aristocrats, opportunistic, bloodthirsty adventurers, traitors. Reluctantly, the two villains are overwhelmed by events.
But in the face of so much injustice and violence, Romulus responds, indicating instinctively what is the point of view of the people.
Release
The Five Days was released in Italy on 20 December 1973.

Welcome Stranger is a 1947 film directed by Elliott Nugent and starring Bing Crosby, Barry Fitzgerald, and Joan Caulfield. It was filmed in Hollywood with location shots at Munz Lakes during March to May 1946. Elliott Nugent appeared in one scene as a doctor sent to examine Barry Fitzgerald and that scene was directed by Billy Wilder.
Plot
Crusty Dr. McRory (Barry Fitzgerald) of Fallbridge, Maine, hires a replacement for his vacation sight unseen. Alas, he and young singing doctor Jim Pearson (Bing Crosby) don't hit it off, but Pearson is delighted to stay, once he meets teacher Trudy Mason (Joan Caulfield). The locals, taking their cue from McRory, cold-shoulder Pearson, especially Trudy's stuffy fiancée. But then, guess who needs an emergency appendectomy.

Release and reception
The film was given the biggest advertising campaign for a Paramount film since For Whom the Bell Tolls. The New York premiere was held on August 6, 1947 at the Paramount and in its initial release period in the United States, the film took in $6.1 million in rentals, making it the highest-grossing film released in the United States during 1947. The reviewer for Variety had seen the film at the Los Angeles tradeshow in April and commented: "Welcome Stranger should find the boxoffice path easy treading. It's crammed with all the ingredients that make for popular entertainment. . . Crosby and Fitzgerald take obvious pleasure in their friendly antagonist roles as young and old doctors... The New York Times felt that that film did not compare favorably with the previous Crosby / Fitzgerald success Going My Way. However they considered that both men "tower over the script through sheer personality, and especially is this true in Mr. Crosby's case, for Mr. Sheekman has not invested the character of Jim Pearson with much substance. Mr. Fitzgerald's Doc McRory is a more rounded individual, and he does have some quaintly flavorsome dialogue—"blatherskite" is one of his less endearing terms for the young assistant. Joan Caulfield is lovely and competent as the teacher...

All of the songs were written by Jimmy Van Heusen (music) and Johnny Burke (lyrics) and sung by Bing Crosby. Burke and Van Heusen also wrote "Smack in the Middle of Maine" for the film but it was not used.
Crosby recorded all of the songs for Decca Records and these were issued on a 2-disc, 78 rpm album titled "Selections from Welcome Stranger". The songs were also included in the Bing's Hollywood series.

Henry O'Brien, Lord Ibrackan, or Lord O'Brien (c. 1642 – 1 September 1678), styled Hon. Henry O'Brien until 1657, was an Irish nobleman and politician. He was the son of Henry O'Brien, 7th Earl of Thomond, and his first wife, and cousin, Anne O'Brien.
He married Katherine Stuart, 7th Baroness Cifton, daughter of George Stuart, 9th Seigneur d'Aubigny and Lady Katherine Howard: the Aubigny Stuarts were a junior branch of the reigning House of Stuart. They had six children (of whom three died young):
Donough O'Brien, Lord Ibrackan (1663–1682), lost in the sinking of HMS Gloucester
Hon. Henry O'Brien (b. & d. 1665)
Hon. Charles O'Brien (b. & d. 1666)
Hon. George O'Brien, died young
Hon. Mary O'Brien (d. 1683), married John FitzGerald, 18th Earl of Kildare
Katherine Hyde, 8th Baroness Clifton (d. 1706), married Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon
In 1661, he represented Clare in the Parliament of Ireland, and from 1670 until his death in 1678, Northampton. In 1673, he was appointed to the Privy Council of Ireland. His wife's relationship with Charles II gave them a valuable opening at Court, where they already had a friend in Sir Joseph Williamson and they enjoyed high favour in the 1660s.
He died of disease while in camp with his regiment in Flanders. His courtesy title passed to his younger half-brother Henry Horatio O'Brien, Lord Ibrackan. Katherine within three months married their old friend, the statesman Sir Joseph Williamson. The speed of her remarriage gave rise to unkind rumours that the pair had been lovers, and the marriage was disapproved of, even by her children, since Williamson, the son of a country vicar, was not considered a suitable match for a connection of the King.
He is a major character in The Piccadilly Plot, the seventh in the Thomas Chaloner mystery novels by Susanna Gregory.

Artemisia verlotiorum, the Chinese mugwort, is a species of plant in the sunflower family, widespread across much of Eurasia.
Etymology
It is named for Jean Baptiste Verlot, who first distinguished the plant from Artemisia vulgaris in 1877 and for his brother Pierre Bernard Verlot, and is sometimes referred to as Verlot's Mugwort.
Description
It has oblong reddish to brown capitula, its stems are green and the leaves broader, lighter colored and denser on the stem. The plant is more strongly and pleasantly aromatic than Artemisia vulgaris. It flowers very late in the summer, but reproduces mainly by stolons, thus forming thick groups. Chinese Mugwort shares the same habitat as Artemisia vulgaris, and both are very common.
Artemisia verlotiorum is often confused with Artemisia vulgaris ("common mugwort"), which is closely related.

Black Point is an estate on the south shore of Geneva Lake in Wisconsin, United States, built in 1888 as a summer home by Conrad Seipp, a beer tycoon from Chicago. It has also been known as Conrad and Catherine Seipp Summer House and as Die Loreley
The Queen Anne style mansion features a nautical-themed, four-story, "crow's nest" observation tower, which can be seen from many points on the lake; the property also features post-civil war-era furniture.
It was designed by Adolph Cudell. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.
The state of Wisconsin owns the property and leases it to the Black Point Historic Preserve, a nonprofit organization which manages the property for public tours, which began in June 2007.
The estate and its grounds, including 620 feet of shoreline, are protected from future development by a conservation easement co-held by the Geneva Lake Conservancy, a local not-for-profit conservation organization, and the Preserve.

Hugh Thomson (1 June 18607 May 1920) was an Irish Illustrator born at Coleraine near Derry. He is best known for his pen-and-ink illustrations of works by authors such as Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and J. M. Barrie. Thomson inaugurated the Cranford School of illustration with the publication of the 1891 Macmillan reissue of Mrs. Gaskell's Cranford.
Biography
Hugh Thomson was born to tea merchant John Thomson (1822–1894) and shopkeeper Catherine (née Andrews) (d. 1871). He was the eldest of their three surviving children. Although he had no formal artistic training, as a young boy he would often fill his schoolbooks with drawings of horses, dogs, and ships. He attended Coleraine Model School, but left at the age of fourteen to work as a clerk at E. Gribbon & Sons, Linen Manufacturers. Several years later his artistic talents were discovered, and in 1877 he was hired by printing and publishing company Marcus Ward & Co.
On 29 December 1884 Thomson married Jessie Naismith Miller in Belfast. Soon afterwards they moved back to London for Thomson's career. They had one son together, John, born in 1886.
In 1911, he and his family moved to Sidcup, hoping to improve their "ever delicate health." Thomson's correspondence reflects the fact that he missed being close to the National Gallery and the museums where he usually compiled research for his illustrations. During World War I, demand for Thomson's work decreased to a few propaganda pamphlets and some commissions from friends. By 1917, Thomson had fallen on financial hardship and he had to take a job with the Board of Trade, where he worked until 1919.
Thomson died of heart disease at his home in Wandsworth Common on 7 May 1920.
Career
At the age of 17, Thomson joined the art department at Marcus Ward & Co. There his mentor was John Vinycomb, head of the art department. Vinycomb and Thomson's cousin, Mrs. William H. Dodd, encouraged his artistic development during the first years of his career.
Thomson's artistic ambitions led him to London in 1883 where he became a leading contributor The English Illustrated Magazine. He first worked for the magazine with Randolph Caldecott on the 1885–86 issue, and later collaborated with Herbert Railton on the 1887–88 issue. His style at the time is said to be in the "straight tradition of Caldecott."
Thomson also gained praise and influenced many young artists through his book illustrations. He notably illustrated editions of William Shakespeare, Jane Austen, and Charles Dickens. His illustrations for Elizabeth Gaskell's Cranford (1891) inspired a slew of publishers to produce a series of gift books in a similar style ("crown octavo with three edges gilt, bound in dark green cloth, front and spine heavily stamped in gold"). Between 1886 and 1900, he illustrated a set of small classics for Macmillans and Kegan Paul. Much of his work during that period consisted of elaborately illustrated gift books and reprints of popular classics. Thomson's most popular illustrations were "fine line drawing of rural characters and gentle countrified society."
His works were featured in a number of exhibitions during his lifetime, including an 1899 exhibit at the Birmingham and Midland Institute and a 1910 exhibit of his watercolor drawings for Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor at The Leicester Galleries in London. His illustrations were also featured in an 1891 exhibit with fellow illustrator Kate Greenaway at the Fine Art Society.
Methods
Thomson is best known for his pen-and-ink illustrations. He prepared most of his work in black and white until the early years of the 20th century, but would sometimes tint pieces for exhibits. The earliest known example of this was for the 1899 Birmingham and Midland Institute exhibition, where he colored the Cranford illustrations he had first drawn eight years earlier. Throughout his career Thomson occasionally dabbled with watercolors, but only used color in his illustrations in response to his publishers' demand. His first book illustrations prepared and printed fully in color were for the last two books in the Cranford series, Scenes of Clerical Life (1906) and Silas Marner (1907).
When working on a new illustration, Thomson would research his subject in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. He would often take detailed notes on costumes, furniture, old prints, and architectural records. His attention to detail can be seen in his sketchbooks, which include pages devoted to the changing styles of ladies' bonnets and descriptions of "the details of a cavalry officer's regimentals, together with a series of studies of how such an officer would hold the reins of his mount." When illustrating a series of pieces set in the same location, Thomson would maintain the details of each room, hallway, or facade, drawing them from different angles throughout the publication.
Thomson was often praised for his ability to "project himself into a story." Much of his work has become inseparable from the publications themselves. Such is the case with his illustrations for Pride and Prejudice and the other Austen novels. When J. M. Barrie's Quality Street was published with Thomson's illustrations in 1913, the art critic for the Daily News stated, "The Barrie-Thomson combination is as perfect in its way as that of Gilbert and Sullivan."
Thomson was elected RI, a member of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1897 and retired in 1907.
The Cranford School
Thomson was the first of the Cranford School of illustrators who abandoned the 1890s style of Beardsley for the delicacy of an eighteenth-century mode. The 'Cranford School' of illustration was not so much a 'school' with a common training, but more of a style which celebrated a sentimental, pre-industrial notion of ‘old England'. The style was named for Thomson's illustrations of the Macmillan reissue of Mrs. Gaskell's Cranford. Cranford was the first of a series of 24 volumes, of which Thomson illustrated 11. Felmingham includes the Cranford School within a broader movement that he called the Wig and Powder School which he states reflected an aspect of contemporary taste that . . . is sometimes called the 'Queen Ann revival'''. Felmingham included the popularity of such architectural features as high-pitched roof, Flemish gables, and white or green painted sash windows as an outward expression of the revival. Jenkins states that the term Wig and Powder School is loosely equivalent to the Cranford School and that the latter term was mostly used between 1890 and 1914.
The style was a nostalgic, affectionate and slightly whimsical approach to historical themes. and was distinguished by graphic nostalgia for a philistinism that was no more. The members of the school had all been fired by the literature, art, costume or atmosphere of England in the eighteenth century and became dealers in nostalgia on a very large scale. It was a style of illustration harking back to pre-industrial rural England, which specialized in the nostalgic recreation of a by-gone golden era before the ravages of industrialization. Cooke notes that the style involved the careful representation of Regency dress and interiors, pastoral settings and sharp characterization which was based on a close reading of the text. The emergence of the Cranford School style was only possible because photo-mechanical reproduction of drawings allowed the fine pen lines distinctive of the school to be reproduced, which was impossible with the older technique of wood engravings.
Thomson was the originator of the school. Other members of the school were:
C. E. Brock (18701938)
H. M. Brock (18751960)
Christiana Mary Demain Hammond (18601900), who signed her work Chris Hammond.
Fred Pegram (18701937)
F. H. Townsend (18681920)

The Eagle Station group (abbreviated PES - Pallasite Eagle Station) is a set of pallasite meteorite specimen that don't fit into any of the other defined pallasite groups. In meteorite classification five meteorites have to be found, so they can be defined as their own group. Currently only five Eagle Station type meteorites have been found, which is just enough for a separate group.
Naming and history
The Eagle Station group is named after the Eagle Station meteorite, the type specimen of the group. It is in turned named after Eagle Station, Carroll County Kentucky where it was found.
Description
The Eagle Station group has a composition similar to Main group pallasites. Diagnostic differences are that the olivine is richer in iron and calcium. The group also has a distinct oxygen isotope signature.
The meteoric iron is similar to the IIF iron meteorites. This might indicate that Eagle station group and IIF formed close to each other in the solar nebula.
Parent body
The trace elements in the phosphates of the Eagle Station group are distinct from other pallasites. Most pallasites are believed to be derived from the core-mantle boundary. Trace elements indicate that the Eagle Station group came from shallower depths of their parent body.
Notable specimen
Only five specimens have been found so far:
Cold Bay meteorite
Eagle Station meteorite (type specimen)
Itzawisis meteorite
Karavannoe meteorite
Oued Bourdim 001

Tun Jeanne Abdullah née Danker (born 29 July 1953) is married to the former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. She married Abdullah Badawi while he was in office. She is his second wife after the death of Badawi's first wife, Endon Mahmood.
Jeanne was formerly married to the younger brother of Abdullah's first late wife. She was also a manager at the Seri Perdana residential complex and has two children from her previous marriage. However, earlier in March that year, the premier dismissed rumours about his plans to remarry even though the rumours had been circulating for more than a year.
Early life
Born Jeanne Danker on 29 July 1953 in Kuala Lumpur to a Roman Catholic Portuguese-Eurasian (Kristang) family with roots in the state of Malacca, she was the eldest of four siblings. She is an alumna of SMK Assunta in Petaling Jaya, Selangor.
Jeanne later converted to Islam at the age of 23, when she married her first husband, Othman Mahmood, who was the younger brother of Abdullah's first late wife, Tun Endon Mahmood.
Jeanne worked in the hotel management field at major hotels including Kuala Lumpur Hilton and the Pan Pacific Hotel. At one point, she was supervisor of the Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister's official residence while Abdullah Badawi was Deputy Prime Minister, and became the manager of Seri Perdana, the Prime Minister's residence, when Abdullah assumed the premiership.
Family
Jeanne has two daughters, Nadiah Kimie, and Nadene Kimie, from her previous marriage. Nadiah runs a visual communications company in Kuala Lumpur. Nadene is involved in the fashion industry, dealing with fashion-related and lifestyle projects.
Marriage with Abdullah
On 9 June 2007, she was escorted in a Proton Chancellor car bearing the Prime Minister's favourite license number 13, by police from her home in Damansara Perdana to be married to Abdullah Badawi at a private ceremony attended by close family members at the Prime Minister's official residence, Seri Perdana in Putrajaya. The bride-to-be arrived at around 2.20 pm. Among the wedding guests which included some 50 relatives were Abdullah's daughter, Nori, daughter-in-law Azrene Abdullah, his four grandchildren, Jeanne's two daughters, her father Mathew Danker and Endon's nine surviving brothers and sisters. Also present at the private wedding were Yayasan Budi Penyayang executive officer Leela Mohd Ali, Abdullah's private secretary Datuk Mohamed Thajudeen Abdul Wahab, his brother-in-law Telekom Malaysia Berhad chairman, Tan Sri Ir. Muhammad Radzi Mansor and wife Puan Sri Aizah Mahmood.
The marriage was solemnised in the surau of Seri Perdana by the Imam from the Putra Mosque of Putrajaya, Haji Abd Manaf Mat, at 2.50 pm and was witnessed by the prime minister's son, Kamaluddin, and son-in-law, Khairy Jamaluddin. Abdullah slipped a solitaire diamond ring onto Jeanne's left ring finger and kissed her on the cheek. Jeanne then slipped a wedding band on Abdullah's finger before taking his hands together into hers and kissing them.
Later in the evening, Abdullah and Jeanne visited Endon's grave which is located at the Taman Selatan Muslim cemetery in Precinct 20 of Putrajaya.
Her first official engagement as the wife of the Prime Minister was when she accompanied Abdullah to Brunei on 11 June 2007 to attend a banquet hosted by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei in conjunction with the wedding of the Sultan's fourth daughter Princess Hajah Majeedah Nuurul Bulqiah to Pengiran Khairul Khalil Pengiran Syed Haji Jaafar.
At a press conference after the engagement was announced, Abdullah stated he had known her for about two decades, as she had been his first wife's sister-in-law; Jeanne had been married to Othman Mahmood, who was the younger brother of Abdullah's first wife, Tun Endon Mahmood. Abdullah also denied that Endon had asked him to marry Jeanne, but said Endon had loved her as "Otherwise she would not have asked her to manage our official residence". Abdullah also said that there would be no bersanding ceremony or hantaran (exchange of wedding gifts) as this was not his first marriage.
Public life
During late 2007, Toh Puan (then Datin Seri) Jeanne Abdullah was made Open University Malaysia's second chancellor. The first was the late Tun Endon Mahmood, the former Prime Minister's first wife before passing away. In addition to that she is Chairperson of Landskap Malaysia and patron of Paralympic Council of Malaysia.
Honours
Upon marriage to Abdullah, Jeanne was automatically conferred the female version of her husband's honorific title, Dato' Seri, which is Datin Seri. Later on 3 April 2009, the King of Malaysia, Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin at Istana Negara awarded the Seri Setia Mahkota (SSM) upon Jeanne. The SSM carried the honorific title Tun for the recipients. The award was conferred by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong in conjunction to the handing over of Prime Minister office from her husband to Najib Razak

In the 13th century, Isny's merchants built a fortification system to protect the town from marauders and rival feudal rulers. The town is still partially surrounded by the city walls and moat that were built during these early turbulent times.
After three centuries of domination by feudal lords and territorial rulers, Isny's middle class was able to purchase the town's independence in 1365. Isny's status as an Imperial city made it a self-governing republic in which the city government was elected by propertied residents and in which the guild system thrived. In 1529, Isny's Protestant minority took the city council and voted to make the town Protestant and the Nikolaikirche became the town's main Protestant church. In 1803, the city was mediatized and became a possession of the Counts of Quadt. In 1806, the city passed to the Kingdom of Württemberg, which allowed the Catholic majority to once again move to the city. In 1889, the majority of urban residents was Catholic (1139 ev / 1444 Cath.).
Isny enjoyed a vibrant economy, based primarily on linen production, until competition from abroad, the devastation of the Thirty Years' War, and a series of fires and plagues brought production to a halt in the 17th century. The town experienced a revival after the end of World War II, when a rehabilitation center for war veterans was established there. Isny emerged from the war largely undamaged, and has since become a popular destination for vacationers and resort-goers.
In the late 1970s, the town commissioned the renowned graphic designer Otl Aicher to create a graphic identity for its tourist board. Aicher responded with a set of 128 black and white pictograms which, while initially controversial, are now regarded as forward thinking and are still used to promote the town.

HMAS Albany (ACPB 86), named for the city of Albany, Western Australia, is an Armidale-class patrol boat of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).
Design and construction
The Armidale class patrol boats are long, with a beam of , a draught of , and a standard displacement of 270 tons. The semi-displacement vee hull is fabricated from aluminium alloy, and each vessel is built to a combination of Det Norske Veritas standards for high-speed light craft and RAN requirements. The Armidales can travel at a maximum speed of , and are driven by two propeller shafts, each connected to an MTU 16V M70 diesel. The ships have a range of at , allowing them to patrol the waters around the distant territories of Australia, and are designed for standard patrols of 21 days, with a maximum endurance of 42 days.
The main armament of the Armidale class is a Rafael Typhoon stabilised gun mount fitted with an M242 Bushmaster autocannon. Two machine guns are also carried. Boarding operations are performed by two , waterjet propelled rigid-hulled inflatable boats (RHIBs). Each RHIB is stored in a dedicated cradle and davit, and is capable of operating independently from the patrol boat as it carries its own communications, navigation, and safety equipment.
Each patrol boat has a standard ship's company of 21 personnel, with a maximum of 29. The Armidales do not have a permanently assigned ship's company; instead, they are assigned to divisions at a ratio of two vessels to three companies, which rotate through the vessels and allow the Armidales to spend more time at sea, without compromising sailors' rest time or training requirements. A 20-berth auxiliary accommodation compartment was included in the design for the transportation of soldiers, illegal fishermen, or unauthorised arrivals; in the latter two cases, the compartment could be secured from the outside. However, a malfunction in the sewerage treatment facilities aboard in August 2006 pumped hydrogen sulphide and carbon monoxide into the compartment, non-fatally poisoning four sailors working inside, after which use of the compartment for accommodation was banned across the class.
Albany was constructed by Austal at their shipyard in Henderson, Western Australia. She was commissioned into the RAN in her namesake city on 15 July 2006.
Operational history
Albany is assigned to Attack Division, is based in Darwin and performs border protection and fisheries protection patrols.

Astrid Peth is a fictional character played by Kylie Minogue in the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who. She is a one-off companion of the Tenth Doctor who appears in the episode "Voyage of the Damned", which was first broadcast in the UK on 25 December 2007. Minogue's casting in the role was a major coup for Doctor Who, her fame attracting much publicity for "Voyage of the Damned". Subsequently, much of the episode's success in terms of viewing figures was attributed to Minogue's appearance in the role.
Appearance
Television
Astrid appears in the episode "Voyage of the Damned". She is introduced aboard the starship Titanic as a humanoid waitress from the planet Sto with a dream of seeing the stars. Meeting the Tenth Doctor aboard Titanic, she quickly befriends him. She accompanies the Doctor (David Tennant) on a trip organised by Titanic'''s resident historian, Mr Copper (Clive Swift), teleporting with some Titanic passengers down to Earth where she and the Doctor meet Wilfred Mott (Bernard Cribbins). Upon their return to the ship, she and the Doctor discover the plan of Max Capricorn (George Costigan) to destroy the Titanic, its passengers and the nearby people of Earth with his villainous angelic robots, the Host. As they attempt to save the ship, Astrid grows increasingly fond of the Doctor, kissing him as part of what she assures is an "old tradition" on Sto. In the episode's climax, Astrid sacrifices herself to save the Doctor from Capricorn by driving Capricorn off a platform with a forklift truck and both appear to fall to their deaths. Later, realising Astrid was still wearing a teleporter bracelet, the Doctor attempts to recall her atoms in an attempt to resurrect her, but there is insufficient power aboard the damaged Titanic to do so. Astrid reappears spectral and bewildered, as the Doctor gives her a goodbye kiss before freeing her sentient atoms (described as "stardust") to roam space as energy.
Literature
In the 2013 novel Shroud of Sorrow, the Shroud, the main antagonist of the book, takes the form of deceased loved ones known to the people it approaches, in a bid to entice and entrap them. For the Eleventh Doctor, it takes the form of Astrid. The Doctor later uses a 'Once More With Feeling' device to revisit memories of losing friends, including Astrid's death, to generate enough personal grief that the Shroud releases its victims and latches on to him.
Development
Character creation
In August 2007, screenwriter and executive producer Russell T Davies announced that Astrid Peth would be the next companion, following the positive reception towards Martha Jones, (played by Freema Agyeman). Astrid's surname, Peth, was confirmed in the Christmas edition of Radio Times. Davies has stated that the character was always going to be a "one-off" even before Minogue was cast and that Astrid would demonstrate "a whole new take – again – on what a companion can be". The name Astrid Peth generated some speculation before the episode's broadcast over the findings that Astrid is an anagram of TARDIS, and that Peth means thing in Welsh. However, the episode established no such connection. On Doctor Who Confidential, Minogue describes Astrid as a "dreamer" and that meeting with the Doctor rekindles Astrid's desire to explore. Later in his book A Writer's Tale Davies discussed with co-author Benjamin Cook how he had originally named the character "Peth" in a treatment but it bugged him, he later renamed her to "Astrid" giving the reason that it "...sounds more spacey, more like a futuristing Doctor's companion".
Despite Davies stating that the companion in "Voyage of the Damned" was "always going to [be] a one-off...little knowing that it would be Kylie Minogue", he has since stated that he would cast Minogue again "like that". In 2008 The Daily Express quoted Minogue as saying there had been talk that her character could be reintroduced at a later date. Davies refused to comment when Doctor Who is a Magazine asked him about the rumours regarding Minogue's return to Doctor Who.
Casting
The BBC officially announced that Minogue was to feature as Astrid in the episode "Voyage of the Damned" on 3 July 2007. The official announcement followed rumours regarding Minogue's casting having already circulated in the press, although the episode's writer Russell T Davies had denied these rumours in in-house BBC publication Ariel in an attempt to keep the news secret for longer. Furthermore, Minogue herself had confirmed that she would be appearing in the episode in InStyle magazine, whilst the London paper Standard Lite published a photograph of Minogue's creative director Will Baker carrying a 'to-do list' with a note about a Doctor Who script on it, thus indicating that Minogue would be in the episode. Minogue had also been sighted filming for Doctor Who by members of the public before the official announcement of her casting. Baker, a long-term Doctor Who fan, was largely responsible for Minogue's casting by setting up a meeting between her, Davies and Julie Gardner. Davies has claimed that Minogue was keen to appear on Doctor Who to relaunch her acting career.
Promotion and reception
Promotion
Minogue posed with a Dalek in an exclusive photo shoot for Doctor Who is a Magazine promoting "Voyage of the Damned". The shoot paid homage to actress Katy Manning's (who portrayed Jo Grant) famous nude photo shoot with a Dalek. Tenth Doctor actor David Tennant interviewed Minogue about her role as Astrid Peth on BBC Radio 2 in X-Amining Kylie first broadcast on 27 November 2007. Lengthier discussion about her involvement in "Voyage of the Damned" was included in the extended repeat of X-Amining Kylie, entitled Re-X-Amining Kylie, broadcast on Boxing Day 2007. It was leaked to The Sun and other media outlets that Astrid would kiss the Doctor.
Reception
The episode was seen by 13.8 million watching at its peak, according to consolidated ratings, when it was first broadcast on Christmas Day on BBC One. The ratings success of "Voyage of the Damned" has been partially and fully attributed to Minogue's casting in the role of Astrid. Younger viewers who were fans of pop star Kylie were left distraught by Astrid's death and had to be convinced that Kylie was not dead in real life.
Although reviewer Jane Simon would have liked to have seen more of the character and it has been asserted that her appearance in the episode has helped her make "a full return to the limelight", Minogue's appearance was not universally praised. Gareth McLean, a TV writer for The Guardian, described Minogue as "not that good...she's blank and insipid". McLean wrote:
There's no chemistry between Astrid and the Doctor, she delivers her lines with a real lack of conviction and thus we never really believe in Astrid as a character. Where Catherine Tate's Donna in last year's special was overbearing, Kylie Minogue's Astrid is hardly there at all. It does make you wonder why casting Kylie was regarded as a coup. She's a pop star – of course she's going to say yes to being beamed into millions of homes in the run-up to Christmas. She's got a duff album to sell. In truth, Kylie should be grateful to [Doctor Who].
David Belcher of The Herald wrote that Minogue looked too old to play a waitress. Sam Wollaston of The Guardian claimed Kylie's performance was "disappointing" and did not live up to those of Freema Agyeman or Billie Piper in Doctor Who. Jim Shelley of The Mirror stated that Minogue did not "look vivacious enough to be worth all the fuss". Conversely, Paddy Shennan of the Liverpool Echo accused the makers of cynically including shots of Minogue's cleavage and legs. Tim Teeman of the Times Online described Astrid as "gutsy", but commented on Minogue's "older" appearance and likened her "breathy delivery" to her performance as Charlene Mitchell in Neighbours. In 2012, Will Salmon of SFX named Astrid's demise as one of the five worst companion departures, writing that her death circumstance was "a bit daft" and her starlight farewell was a "laughably mawkish scene".
Billie Piper, who portrayed former companion Rose Tyler, commented that it was a "great idea" to cast Minogue, and was disappointed to miss meeting and befriending her on the set of Doctor Who as Tennant had done.
In "Journey's End", Davros taunts the Doctor about the countless people who have died for him. A clip from "Voyage of the Damned" featuring Astrid is shown as part of a montage. Character Options has produced an action figure of Astrid for inclusion in a "Voyage of Damned" action figure box set.

Keith Khan (born 1963, Wimbledon) is an English artist, designer, performance artist and arts industry bureaucrat. In 1996, together with Ali Zaidi, he co-founded the arts organisation Motiroti.
Life
Khan studied Fine Art/ Sculpture at Middlesex University. Until 2004, most of the artistic events with which Khan was directly involved were under Motiroti, which produced notable projects such as Flying costumes, Floating Tombs (1991) which won the Time Out Dance and Performance Award; Queen's Golden Jubilee Commonwealth Celebrations (2002) and Alladeen (2004) which won the Village Voice OBIE Award Special Citation, co-produced by The Builders Association. Khan departed from Moti Roti in 2004 and has filled a number of senior executive positions since then, most notably, Head of Culture and then Artistic Executive to the 2012 Summer Olympics (2007 to 2009) and sitting on the panels of high-profile funding bodies, including the Wellcome Trust and as a Council Member of the Arts Council of England. Keith Khan is also a Member of the Advisory Panel of Art on the Underground and was the Costume and 3D Designer for the Opening Ceremony for the Central and Opening Show at the Millennium Dome (2000); Director of Design for the 2002 Commonwealth Games ceremonies under the direction of David Zolkwer. ; Chief Executive of Rich Mix (2004 to 2007); Chair of Diversity Group for Creative Economy Programme Working Group (2006) and has been a Member of the Commonwealth Group on Culture and Development since 2009.
Controversy
Rich Mix – Khan resigned amid questions of leadership and cost controlling. Karen Bartlett wrote in The Times ""Keith was not a natural cost controller, but the board was also weak". Overstaffing, disputes between builders and architects with some funders temporarily withholding revenue in 2007 until a new business plan could be agreed. Khan did not want to comment on Rich Mix for this article."
London 2012 – While in his role as Head of Culture, Khan was criticised by some commentators for being excessively "anti-elitist". He was commended by others for trying to make the Arts more relevant to young people across the UK. His departure in 2008 was greeted with relief by some in the press and concern by others. The response of Richard Brooks in The Times was "Thank goodness... Keith Khan, its artistic executive, is leaving.".

In scientific research, an experimental system is the physical, technical and procedural basis for an experiment or series of experiments. Historian of science Hans-Jörg Rheinberger defines an experimental system as: "A basic unit of experimental activity combining local, technical, instrumental, institutional, social, and epistemic aspects." Scientists (particularly laboratory biologists) and historians and philosophers of biology have pointed to the development and spread of successful experimental systems, such as those based on popular model organism or scientific apparatus, as key elements in the history of science, particularly since the early 20th century. The choice of an appropriate experimental system is often seen as critical for a scientist's long-term success, as experimental systems can be very productive for some kinds of questions and less productive for others, acquiring a sort of momentum that takes research in unpredicted directions.
A successful experimental system must be stable and reproducible enough for scientists to make sense of the system's behavior, but variable and unpredictable enough that it can produce useful results. In many cases, a well-understood experimental system can be "black-boxed" as a standard technique, which can then be a component of other experimental systems. Rheinberger divides experimental systems into two parts: the part under investigation ("epistemic things") and the well-understood part that provides a stable context for experimentation ("technical objects").
The development of experimental systems in biology often requires the "domestication" of a particular organism for the laboratory environment, including the creation of relatively homogeneous lines or strains and the tailoring of conditions to highlight the variable aspects that scientists are interested in. Scientific technologies, similarly, often require the development of a full experimental system to go from a viable concept to a technique that works in practice on a usefully consistent basis. For example, the invention of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is generally attributed to Kary Mullis, who came up with the concept in 1983, but the process of development of PCR into the revolutionary technology it became by the early 1990s took years of work by others at Cetus Corporation—and the basic components of the system had been known since the 1960s DNA synthesis work of Har Gobind Khorana—making "who invented PCR?" a complicated question.

[[File:Afocal photography.png|thumb|right|350px|An afocal setup with a digital camera and a finderscope with optical diagram:1 - Telescope 2 - Camera 3 - Film or CCD planeL1 - Telescope objectiveL2 - EyepieceL3 - Camera lens]]Afocal photography, also called afocal imaging or afocal projection''' is a method of photography where the camera with its lens attached is mounted over the eyepiece of another image forming system such as an optical telescope or optical microscope, with the camera lens taking the place of the human eye.
Overview
Afocal photography works with any system that can produce a virtual image of parallel light, for example telescopes and microscopes. Afocal photographic setups work because the imaging device's eyepiece produces collimated light and with the camera's lens focused at infinity, creating an afocal system with no net convergence or divergence in the light path between the two devices. In this system the device is focused on the object and the camera are placed above the eyepiece as close as possible. The drawback is the system will have a high focal ratio, with a correspondingly dim image, and some vignetting. A high focal ratio also means the field of view will be narrow. Field of view can be calculated using:
Focal field of view/angle of view:
Approximate:
Precise:
Use with optical telescopes
One method of afocal photography is to mount a camera with its lens attached behind the eyepiece a Keplerian optical telescope, the combination giving the photographer a long focus lens. Historically afocal photography with 35 mm SLR or large format film cameras was a very difficult method of photography. With film cameras the bulk and mechanical shake had to be taken into consideration, with some setups employing a separate tripod for the camera (adding the complexity of setting up the camera in relationship to the eyepiece). The general difficulties of focus and exposure with film cameras, along with the detailed mathematical calculations, combined with the time lag of waiting for the film to be developed, made film afocal photography challenging.
Digital afocal photography
The advent of digital single-lens reflex camera and, moreover, compact point and shoot digital cameras has made the afocal method far more popular since this type of camera is small enough to mount directly on to telescopes or other devices, is for the most part a solid state device with minimal moving parts, has auto focus, has auto exposure adjustment, has some capacity for time exposure, usually has a zoom mechanism to crop vignetting, and has a digital viewframe that allows the user to see the image hitting the viewing plane. Couplers and other devices for mounting digital cameras afocally are commercially available. Simply holding the camera up to the eyepiece and snapping a picture can obtain usable results. Most popular types of consumer digital cameras have non-removable lenses so afocal photography is also the only method available for these types of cameras.
Afocal astrophotography
Afocal photography is a form of astrophotography long practiced by astronomers. Afocal setups with film and digital cameras are not the preferred system for astrophotography since astrophotographers have many ways of coupling a camera to an astronomical telescope, the simplest being prime focus (using no camera lens and allowing the image to fall directly onto the film, or image plane of a digital single-lens reflex camera or purpose built astronomical CCD camera). Almost from their invention amateur astronomers were adapting compact digital still and video cameras for use in afocal astrophotography.
But since most celestial objects require a long exposure, compact consumer digital cameras are somewhat problematic due to their high inherent sensor noise. This noise limits their usefulness, especially since point-objects, such as stars, can be obscured by even one "hot" pixel. The narrow field of view for this type of photography lends itself to lunar and planetary objects. Continuing advancements in digital camera and image manipulation have somewhat overcome this limitation and digital afocal astrophotography has become more popular.
Daytime afocal photography
Since the development of compact digital cameras, afocal photography is also widely used by birdwatchers, naturalists, and other photographers. In the birdwatching community it quickly acquired the coined name of “digiscoping”. Birdwatchers and naturalists found a digital camera used afocally with a spotting scope to be a particularly effective technique since it gave them an easy way to record their subjects (sometimes by simply holding the camera up to the eyepiece) as well as allowing them to take relatively high quality photographs. Since these types of photographs are usually single subjects (narrow field) in daylight hours, the light loss and narrow angle of view are not a hindrance, and the high effective focal lengths are beneficial. It also facilitates the use of a very long lens without buying and transporting extra equipment, other than perhaps a small afocal adapter.
This technique has lent itself to many other types of photography including photographing plants (for example, wild orchids growing in the canopy of a jungle), insects (for example, wild bees near their beehive), other shy or dangerous wild animals, or details in old buildings (for example, statues/gargoyles on the roof of old churches/castles).
Afocal secondary lenses
Besides combining a Keplerian telescope with a camera, there are also dedicated secondary lens afocal attachments that mount on the front of a camera lens to work in the role of a teleconverter, technically called teleside converters. These lenses are usually Galilean telescopes that alter the width of the entering beam of light without affecting the divergence of the beam, so they can change the effective focal length 1 to 3 times without increasing focal ratio. There are models that are 6x or 8x and even Russian made 12x to 14x Gregorian Maksutov designs that can be used as long lenses and microscopes. Like their Keplerian counterparts these can be universally adapted to most camera lenses with the proper type of adapter.

The white-browed piculet (Sasia ochracea) is a species of bird in the family Picidae. It is found in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam. Its natural habitats are temperate forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.
Description
This small piculet has olive-green upper parts tinged with chestnut and grows to a length of up to . The under parts are cinnamon or rufous, sometimes yellowish on the flanks. The stubby tail is blackish. The crown is green, and there is a white streak above and immediately behind the eye, the latter being surrounded by a ring of bare pinkish or reddish skin. Males have a small golden-yellow patch on the forehead which females lack. Juveniles are duller in colour than adults, greener above and greyer beneath. The beak is grey, the iris is red and the legs are yellow or orange, the feet having just three toes, (four being the norm in the woodpecker family). In southern Myanmar and southeastern Thailand, where their ranges overlap, the white-browed piculet can be confused with the very similar rufous piculet (Sasia abnormis), but differs in the white streak above the eye and the darker beak.
Distribution and habitat
The white-browed piculet is native to tropical southeastern Asia. Its range extends from northern India, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh through southern China to Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam and Thailand. Its home is dense wet or dry forest with plenty of vines and bamboo, scrub and swampy woodlands. It is found at altitudes of up to .
Ecology
It forages in the understory layer not far above the ground, pecking and probing with its sharp beak. Its diet consists of small insects, bark beetles, ants, termites, spiders and other small invertebrates. It often forages in pairs or may join small flocks of mixed species, sometimes descending to the ground, where it may hop for short distances.
This bird uses pieces of bamboo to make its nest. It picks up bits of broken bamboo with its feet, and uses its beak to pull away partially broken fragments. Breeding takes place between March and July.
Status
The white-browed piculet is described as a fairly common bird and has a very extensive range. No particular threats to this bird are known and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the population is believed to be stable. For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this bird's conservation status as being of "least concern".

The siege of Nagpur was laid by Khan-i-Dauran, a high-ranking Mughal official to the fort of Nagpur, ruled by the Gond king of Deogarh, Kok Shah.
Background
In January 1637, Khan-i-Dauran, a sardar of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan was dispatched to demand payment of tribute from Kok Shah, who had defaulted on the annual payment of tribute to the Mughals.
One of the reasons could also be that Jhujhar Singh, the rebellious raja of Orchha was allowed to pass through Deogarh territory unharmed. They were joined by Krishna Shah of Chanda, who had an enmity with the Deogarh kings since the reign of Jatba.
Conflict
Khan-i-Dauran headed towards the frontiers of Deogarh and captured the forts of Udgir and Ausa in 1636. Then he went to meet the Emperor Shah Jahan and presented him with the captured loot. He was ordered to attack Kok Shah of Deogarh. He marched into the Gond country by crossing the river Wardha. First he seized the fortresses of Ashti and Kutaljhar (Keljhar) from Gond sardars, and then besieged Nagpur, a stronghold of Kok Shah. He was assisted by Jai Singh and Sipahdar Khan. Krishna Shah of Chanda joined him and also paid him rupees 70000. Khan Dauran sent his vakil (lawyer) Kanak Singh to Deogarh and demanded Kok Shah to surrender and pay tribute. Kok Shah delayed, thinking his Nagpur fort was strong enough to be impregnable, showing no regard for Khan-i-Dauran's proposal.
Three teams of sappers from Khan Dauran, Jai Singh and Sipahdar Khan were employed to prepare three mines under the walls of the fort. Darvesh Pahalwan was given the task of filling the moat around the fort which was about 20 feet wide. Three mines were fired. Jai Singh's mine could not bring down bastion but other two mines destroyed two bastions and parts of the wall. Jai Singh, Sipahdar Khan and Darvesh Pahalwan led the charge and entered the fort. The assault was successful and the kiladar (castellan) Deoji was taken prisoner.
Peace and aftermath
Kok Shah now arrived from his capital at Deogarh and submitted to Khan Dauran on 16 January 1637. He made peace by presenting one and a half lakhs of rupees in cash and 170 elephants.

The early history of Singapore refers to its pre-colonial era before 1819, when the British East India Company was led by Sir Stamford Raffles established a trading settlement on the island and set in motion the history of Singapore.
Prior to 1819, the island was known by several names; an early reference may be in the 2nd century work by Ptolemy which identified a coastal port at the southernmost tip of the Malayan peninsula, called Sabana. However, historians generally attribute a 3rd-century Chinese traveller's record describing an island at the same location called Pu Luo Chung, a transcription of Singapura's early Malay name Pulau Ujong, as the first recording of its existence.
Singapore was known in the 13th to 14th century as Temasek, a name also recorded in Chinese sources as Dan Ma Xi, a country recorded as having two distinct settlements – Long Ya Men and Ban Zu. It changed its name to Singapura perhaps towards the end of 14th century. The island was alternately claimed by the Siamese and the Javanese in the 14th century. The last ruler of Singapura, Parameswara fled to Malacca after an attack by either the Javanese or Siamese, and established the state of Malacca. It was controlled by Sultanate of Malacca in the 15th century and the Sultanate of Johor from the 16th century.
Early period
From primary historical texts dated before the 14th century, scholars have identified some 24 names that possibly referred to the island of Singapore. The first possible mention of early Singapore dates to 2nd century CE cartographic references in the Greco-Roman astronomer Ptolemy's Geographia. A place called Sabana or Sabara was marked on the 11th Map of Asia at the southern tip of the Golden Khersonese (meaning the Malay Peninsula) where Singapore may lie. It was identified as a nominon emporion or designated foreign trading port, as part of a chain of similar trading centres that linked Southeast Asia with India and the Mediterranean. Identification of Sabana or Sabara however varies, with various authors proposing it to be in Selangor or near Klang, or just south of Malacca, or south Johor, as well as Singapore island itself. No archaeological evidence from this period has yet been found in Singapore.
A 3rd century Chinese written record described the island of Pu Luo Chung (蒲羅中), probably a transcription of the Malay Pulau Ujong, "island at the end" (of the Malay peninsula). It mentions briefly a hearsay account of cannibals with 5 or 6-inch tails living there.
Another possible reference to Singapore was found in Nanhai Jigui Neifa Zhuan (A Record of Buddhist Practices Sent Home from the Southern Sea), travel accounts of the Buddhist monk Yijing from the Tang dynasty. Yijing mentioned several islands located in today's Southeast Asia, and one of which called Mo-he-xin or Mo-ho-hsin (摩诃新) was argued by Brian E. Colless to be the ancient Singapore.
Singapore Stone
A large boulder measuring 3 metres in height and width, inscribed with writings, used to exist at the mouth of the Singapore River, but was later blown up when Fort Fullerton was expanded and the river mouth widened. Only a few fragments survive, and it became known as the Singapore Stone. Various dates between 10th to 13th century have been proposed for the inscriptions that is as yet undeciphered, and the script is suggested to be related to that used in Sumatran in that period.
Temasek
Early Singapore was called "Temasek", possibly a word deriving from "tasik" (Malay for lake or sea) and taken to mean Sea-town in Malay. The Nagarakretagama, a Javanese epic poem written in 1365, listed a settlement on the island called Tumasik as a vassal of the Majapahit. The name is also mentioned in the Malay Annals thought to have been written in 1535. Temasek may have diplomatic relationship with Vietnam, which recorded it as Sach Ma Tich, as early as the 13th century. It is also recorded by the Chinese traveller Wang Dayuan who visited the island around 1330 and described a place called Dan Ma Xi (單馬錫, a transcription of the Malay Temasek). The name Dan Ma Xi or Temasek is written in Chinese as 淡馬錫 in the Mao Kun map.
Long Ya Men and Ban Zu
It was recorded in 1320 that the Mongol sent a mission to obtain elephants from Long Ya Men (龍牙門, Dragon's Teeth Gate). The people of Longyamen then responded in 1325 with a tribute and trade mission to China. Long Ya Men is believed to be the entrance to Keppel Harbour. In his work Daoyi Zhilüe, Wang Dayuan described Long Ya Men as the two hills of Temasek that looked like "Dragon's teeth" between which a strait runs, and wrote about the place:
Wang further mentioned that lakawood and tin was produced there and the natives traded with Chinese from Quanzhou, but Chinese junks on their way back from the Western Oceans (西洋) may be met by pirates there who attacked with two to three hundred perahus (boats). Wang described another settlement on a hill behind Long Ya Men called Ban Zu (班卒, a transcription of the Malay name pancur meaning a "spring"). It is thought to be located on Fort Canning Hill, and a spring used to exist on the west side of the hill. In contrast to those of Long Ya Men who were prone to piracy, the inhabitants of Ban Zu were described as honest, and they wore "their hair short, with turban of gold-brocaded satin," and were dressed in red cloth. Wang also reported that the Siamese attacked Temasek a few years before he visited, but the fortified city survived the attack which lasted a month. Ruins of the settlement on the hill were still visible in the early 19th century and were described by the Resident John Crawfurd. In 1928, pieces of gold ornaments dating to the mid-14th century was discovered at Fort Canning Hill.
Recent excavations in Fort Canning provide evidence that Singapore was a port of some importance in the 14th century and used for transactions between Malays and Chinese.
Various documents suggest that following the decline of Srivijaya power, Temasek was alternately claimed by the Majapahit and the Siamese Ayutthaya Kingdom.
Singapura
Sometime in its history, the name of Temasek was changed to Singapura. The Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals) contains a tale of a prince of Palembang, Sri Tri Buana (also known as Sang Nila Utama), who landed on Temasek after surviving a storm in the 13th century. According to the tale, the prince saw a strange creature, which he was told was a lion; believing this to be an auspicious sign, he decided to found a settlement called Singapura, which means "Lion City" in Sanskrit. It is unlikely there ever were lions in Singapore, though tigers continued to roam the island until the early 20th century. However, the lion motif is common in Hindu mythology, which was dominant in the region during that period (one of the words for "throne" in the Malay language is "singgasana", meaning "lion's seat" in Sanskrit), and it has been speculated that the "Singapura" name, and the tale of the lion, were invented by court historians of the Malacca Sultanate to glorify Sang Nila Utama and his line of descent.
Different versions of its history are told in Portuguese sources, suggesting that Temasek was a Siamese vassal whose ruler was killed by Parameswara from Palembang. Historians believe that during the late 14th century, Parameswara, the last Sumatran prince, fled to Temasek from Palembang after being deposed by the Majapahit Empire. According to Portuguese accounts, Parameswara killed the local chief with the title Sang Aji eight days after being welcomed into Temasek.
Not withstanding the Sejarah Melayu legend, the "Singapura" name possibly dates to this period. Some argued that Singapura was named after the "lion throne" Parameswara established in Palembang as a challenge to the Majapahit empire, and for which he was expelled from Palembang. Parameswara held the island of Singapore for a number of years, until further attacks from either the Majapahit or the Ayutthaya kingdom in Siam forced him to move on to Melaka where he founded the Sultanate of Malacca. While there are parallels between the mythical Sang Nila Utama and the historical Parameswara, these should be seen as distinct.
Singapore as part of sultanate of Malacca
Archaeological evidence suggests that the main settlement on Fort Canning was abandoned around this time, although a small trading settlement continued in Singapore for some time afterwards. Singapore became part of the Malacca empire, and it was said to be the fiefdom of the legendary laksamana (or admiral) Hang Tuah. However, by the time the Portuguese arrived in the early 16th century, the Singapura that existed before Malacca was founded had already become "great ruins" according to the conqueror of Malacca Afonso de Albuquerque.
Part of Johor Sultanate
After the Portuguese captured Malacca in 1511, its laksamana fled to Singapore. In the 16th and early 17th century, it briefly regained some significance as a trading centre of Johor Sultanate whose Sultan kept a shahbandar (harbour master) at Kallang. In 1603, the Johor Malays formed an alliance with the Dutch and captured a Portuguese ship off the east coast of Singapore. The Portuguese then destroyed the outpost in Singapore in 1613. In the early 1620s, it was suggested that forts be built in the Singapore Straits to counter the rising power of the Dutch, but Singapore then sank into obscurity apart from a mention that the Singapore River was the location of a naval battle between Johor and Siak in 1767.
Beginning of colonial rule
In 1819, Englishman Sir Stamford Raffles established a British trading post on the island, and modern Singapore was founded.

Ammit (; , "devourer of the dead"; also rendered Ammut or Ahemait) was a goddess in ancient Egyptian religion with the forequarters of a lion, the hindquarters of a hippopotamus, and the head of a crocodile—the three largest "man-eating" animals known to ancient Egyptians. A funerary deity, her titles included "Devourer of the Dead", "Eater of Hearts", and "Great of Death".
Ammit lived near the scales of justice in Duat, the Egyptian underworld. In the Hall of Two Truths, Anubis weighed the heart of a person against the feather of Ma'at, the goddess of truth, which was depicted as an ostrich feather (the feather was often pictured in Ma'at's headdress). If the heart was judged to be impure, Ammit would devour it, and the person undergoing judgment was not allowed to continue their voyage towards Osiris and immortality. Once Ammit swallowed the heart, the soul was believed to become restless forever; this was called "to die a second time". Ammit was also sometimes said to stand by a lake of fire. In some traditions, the unworthy hearts were cast into the fiery lake to be destroyed. Some scholars believe Ammit and the lake represent the same concept of destruction.
Weighing of the Heart
Ammit lived near the scales of justice in Duat, the Egyptian underworld. In the Hall of Two Truths, Anubis weighed the heart of a person against the feather of Ma'at, the goddess of truth, which was depicted as an ostrich feather (the feather was often pictured in Ma'at's headdress). If the heart was judged to be impure, Ammit would devour it, and the person undergoing judgment was not allowed to continue their voyage towards Osiris and immortality. Once Ammit swallowed the heart, the soul was believed to become restless forever; this was called "to die a second time". Ammit was also sometimes said to stand by a lake of fire. In some traditions, the unworthy hearts were cast into the fiery lake to be destroyed. Some scholars believe Ammit and the lake represent the same concept of destruction.
Iconography
Ammit is commonly depicted with the head of a crocodile, the front legs and upper body of a lion (sometimes also depicted as the upper body of a leopard or a tiger), and the back legs and lower body of a hippopotamus. The combination of these three deadly predators suggests that no evil soul can escape Ammit's annihilation. Ammit has also been depicted with other Egyptian gods weighing the heart of a person after they have passed, and this is where the destiny of a person is decided. If a person is deemed evil, Ammit will destroy the heart and the person is annihilated.
In popular culture
Saba Mubarak portrays Ammit in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) television series Moon Knight (2022).
In Rick Riordan's series, the Kane Chronicles, Ammit is portrayed.

Andrzej Wróblewski (15 June 1927 - 23 March 1957) was a Polish figurative painter who died in a mountaineering accident in 1957 when he was only 29. He is recognized by many as one of Poland's most prominent artists in the early post World War II era, creating a distinctly individualistic approach to representational art.
Biography
Wróblewski was born in Wilno (modern Vilnius) on 15 June 1927, the son of law professor Bronisław Wróblewski from the Stefan Batory University and the painter Krystyna Wróblewska. He showed artistic talent at a very young age. His education was interrupted by the German invasion of Poland, although he was able to attend some underground courses; his mother introduced him to the art of woodcut which he practiced from 1944 to 1946.
Immediately after the end of World War II, following the shifting of Poland's national borders, his family moved from Wilno to Kraków, where he passed the matura exams and became a student in the Painting and Sculpture Department of Poland's oldest art school, the Academy of Fine Arts, where he studied between 1945 and 1952 under Zygmunt Radnicki, Zbigniew Pronaszko (pl), Hanna Rudzka-Cybisowa and Jerzy Fedkowicz. Also between 1945 and 1948 he simultaneously studied art history at the Jagiellonian University, Poland's oldest university (and one of the oldest in the world).
1945-1949
Through exploration in art Wroblewski devised his own formal style, with his own artistic interpretation, revealed in one of his most famous works Executions dating from the late 1940s illustrating his heightened expressiveness and metaphorical abilities depicting real life events.
He was also highly interested in art theoretician and literature critique at times, since 1948 publishing articles in Głos Plastyków ("Artists' Voice"), Przegląd Artystyczny ("Arts Review"), Twórczość ("Creativity"), Gazeta Krakowska (Kraków's Newspaper) and Życie Literackie ("Literary Life").
Last years
In the early 1950s in the People's Republic of Poland Wróblewski adopted the state-favoured style of socrealism. After the death of Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and resulting destalinization lessened governmental pressures on various spheres of life, art included.
Wroblewski died in a mountaineering accident in Tatry on 23 March 1957. He was the author of over 150 oil paintings, 1400 drawings, dozens of other art forms and over 80 published articles. His works are featured in the collections of many Polish museums and exhibitions.
Art market
In November 2021, his painting titled Two Married Women (Polish: "Dwie mężatki") was sold at an auction in Warsaw for a record 13.4 million zloty (ca. $3.2 million) becoming at the time the most expensive work of art sold on the Polish market. It was painted in 1949 and is part of the artists' Societal Contrasts series. It is considered an iconic work of Polish post-war art.

Emma May Vilardi (née Sutton; June 23, 1922 – July 9, 1990)
Emma was born Emma May Sutton in Kansas City, Missouri in 1922 and died in Carson City, Nevada in 1990. Emma authored Heritage and Legacy: Town of Kearny, New Jersey in 1967 and a booklet titled Handbook for the Search in 1973 which was originally distributed to members of ALMA Society and then later by TRIADOPTION® Publications. She also wrote a number of unpublished children's stories.
Early career
In 1975, she founded the International Soundex Reunion Registry, Inc. (ISRR) as a free mutual consent registry serving adoptees, foster children and others separated from birth family. This registry was supported by Vilardi and her husband Tony for many years. They saved all the donations until they were able to purchase the first computer and then the building in Carson City, Nevada which housed the registry until 2007. Vilardi was survived by her husband, son Ed, sister Pat and many nieces, nephews and grandchildren. In addition, Vilardi served as a mentor to many, with her expertise in genealogy research utilized to assist persons seeking reunion with family from whom they had been separated. She served on the planning committees which created the American Adoption Congress (AAC) and was an original signer to the 1981 incorporation. She was also involved in and served on the advisory board of TRIADOPTION Library and other movement organizations.
Dear Abby
Dear Abby wrote a number of responses referring her readers to ISRR beginning in 1983, because after speaking with Vilardi many times, Abigail VanBuren was supportive of the neutral position the registry provided. Vilardi was involved with the offices of Senator Carl Levin in his numerous attempts to create a federally support registry.
Adoption reform
Emma May was among those pioneers of adoption reform whose influence is broader than often recognized. In her honor, the AAC has given the "Emma Vilardi Humanitarian Award" annually since 1991.
Legacy
Emma created many of the forms and letters still utilized in search today. Maybe most widely used are versions of her “Waiver of Confidentiality”. The ISRR website has many of those original creations and even some in her handwriting. (www.isrr.net) . Her name is mentioned in newsletters and articles of the 1979's and 80's (see www.triadoption.com “Newsletters” or “Articles”). Emma's legacy is many things, but most of all the tens of thousands of individuals who have been reunited because of her insight, commitment and vision.
Emma Mae Vilardi Humanitarian Award
Since her passing in 1990, the American Adoption Congress has honored her life and commitment to the adoption community with the Emma May Vilardi Humanitarian Award. The award is distributed annually at the American Adoption Congress International Conference. In 2007, upon the passing of Vilardi's husband, Tony, the award was renamed the Vilardi Award to honor both of them.

Montara Mountain, positioned between the unincorporated community of Montara, California, to the southwest and the city of Pacifica, California, to the north, forms the northern spur of the Santa Cruz Mountains, a narrow mountain range running the length of the San Francisco Peninsula that separates San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean. Its highest point rises to above sea level. Montara and Pacifica are connected by the Tom Lantos Tunnels, which run through the Mountain.
History
The earliest historical trail remnant of Montara Mountain is the prehistoric Indian Trail which traverses the ridgeline between Willow Brook Estates towards Saddle Pass following the high ridgeline above Green Valley and winding down towards Martini Creek. Remnants of this trail remain visible today.
Colonial history
The earliest descriptions of the area are from the Portolá Expedition in 1769,
"We halted near the shore, along which the passage was entirely closed by a steep hill, at the foot of which ran a stream of good water. This stream flowed from a hollow formed by various hills; at the extreme end of this hollow, close to the hills, we pitched our camp, which was thus protected to the north. To-day's march was one league. The place afterwards known by the name of Rincón de las Almejas." On October 31, the expedition began its climb of Montara Mountain. Portolá wrote: “We travelled two hours of very bad road up over a very high mountain.” When they got to the top, the commander noted that “25 heathens came up.” These were the Aramai of Pruristac. "A village of very fine, well-behaved friendly heathens, …(who brought) a good many black pies made of seeds...There must be many villages...for we have seen many smokes from here; mussels are also very plentiful here, and very large... Many deer have been seen upon the hills here... Bear tracks and droppings have been seen...our sick men since we left the creek of La Salud (Waddell Creek in Santa Cruz County) have been improving more every day..." They had descended the treeless hill and pitched camp in the middle of a small valley (San Pedro).
Mexican period
During the Mexican Rancho era, a road known as Camino Pedro Cuesta also traversed Saddle Pass and connected the Sanchez Adobe in Rancho San Pedro in San Pedro Valley with Rancho Corral de Tierra Palomares in Montara. Following the Mexican–American War of 1848, this routing was known as "Road Trail" and was considered to be nearly impassable to wheeled vehicles. In 1879 this steep and rutted Road Trail crossing of Montara Mountain was replaced by the marginally improved road known as the Half Moon Bay - Colma Road, which included road grades of 24%. This road which routed closer to the ocean and Devil's Slide terminated in Shamrock Ranch and persisted until 1915.
Biodiversity
Due in part to its biologically isolated location near the end of a peninsula, the mountain has an extensive and unique biodiversity, especially on the serpentine soils of the lower slopes. A number of plant endangered species are found on this mountain, including Hickman's potentilla and San Mateo thornmint, Acanthomintha duttonii. The rare endemic manzanita Arctostaphylos montaraensis was named for this mountain.
Water bodies
On occasions light snow has dusted the summit. On clear days the summit has views of much of the San Francisco Bay Area. Denniston Creek, Arroyo de en Medio, Dean Creek, and San Pedro Creek rise on Montara Mountain. The steelhead population in San Pedro Creek is within the Central California Coast Steelhead distinct population segment and is listed at threatened (2011). Brooks Creek, a tributary of San Pedro Creek originates on the north face of the mountain and forms a tall thin waterfall, Brooks Falls, which is the tallest in San Mateo County at 207 feet.
Trails
An unpaved fire road, the North Peak Access Road, accessible from the Pedro Mountain Road in McNee Ranch State Park, provides access to the summit by hikers from the south. From the north, Montara Mountain Trail, Hazelnut Trail and Brooks Creek Trail provide access to the mountain with trailheads in San Pedro Valley County Park.

"Future-Drama" is the fifteenth episode of the sixteenth season of the American animated television series The Simpsons. The 350th episode overall, it originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 17, 2005. In the episode, Bart and Lisa stumble into Professor Frink's basement, and he gives them a look into their future as teenagers getting ready for their high school graduation.
Matt Selman wrote the episode, and Mike B. Anderson served as director. Amy Poehler and John DiMaggio guest-starred as the characters of Jenda and Bender, respectively.
Plot
In the midst of one of their arguments, Bart and Lisa fall into Professor Frink's basement. Frink uses an astrology-based machine to show the kids their future as teenagers.
Eight years in the future (2013), Bart and Lisa are getting ready for their high school graduation and Homer and Marge have separated after Homer blew the family savings on an undersea home. Lisa is graduating two years early and has a scholarship to Yale University, while dating a muscular Milhouse and Bart dates a skateboarder named Jenda. He also shows them a picture of Lisa at age 12 (2009) after she was saved by Milhouse from a fire, which she later learns that he started. After the prom, Jenda wants to have sex with Bart, but Bart has no plans for the future and wants Jenda to marry him and live an aimless life, so she breaks up with him.
Bart unsuccessfully seeks advice from Homer on dating. He then shows Lisa a hologram of the prom, and tells her love can be painful; she agrees, noting she broke up with Milhouse and he had an Incredible Hulk-style meltdown. Lisa suggests that to get Jenda back, he must show her he can provide for her. Bart decides to take Lisa's advice and gets a job at the Kwik-E-Mart. While delivering groceries to Mr. Burns, he rescues him from a robbery by Snake Jailbird. As a reward, Burns gives Lisa's scholarship to Bart. He accepts it, seeing it as a way to get Jenda back. He then tells Lisa about the scholarship causing present and future Lisa to both get angry at Bart. Bart reconciles with Jenda, and now has a good future. That night, Jenda again wants to have sex with Bart, but then he goes into Professor Frink's basement and sees Lisa's bleak future with Milhouse on Frink's machine. Jenda is furious at Bart (she notes she never had any problems sparking romance with Todd Flanders), and gives him an ultimatum: leave and they are finished. Bart does head out and saves Lisa from accepting Milhouse's dismal proposal, then tells his sister he is giving her scholarship back and will find a woman who loves him for himself. Professor Frink then tells present Bart he will get one at age 83, then die one minute later, and his brain would be buried in a pauper's grave.
Meanwhile, Marge has dumped Krusty and reunites with Homer in the underwater home. During the credits, Bart is shown to find the sequence boring, and instead watches Cletus Spuckler's future as the Vice President of the United States on his way to a funeral for the Sultan of Brunei.
Production
The episode was written by Matt Selman, his thirteenth writing credit for The Simpsons. The episode was the third season sixteen episode that Mike B. Anderson directed, following "Fat Man and Little Boy" and "Pranksta Rap". It was the third future-themed episode of The Simpsons, following the season six episode "Lisa's Wedding" and the season eleven episode "Bart to the Future".
Even though this is the 350th episode broadcast on FOX, the 350th in production order is "The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star" (which was temporarily shelved following Pope John Paul II's death, and was originally supposed to air after "Don't Fear the Roofer").
In an interview, Selman stated that the story of the episode originated when he asked himself what if people saw Bart and Lisa grow up as "ugly teenagers".
Cultural references
The episode's title is a parody of the TV series Futurama, which was also created by Simpsons creator Matt Groening. The character Bender makes a cameo appearance when Homer and Bart pass through a quantum tunnel; voice actor John DiMaggio reprised his role voicing Bender. The song playing while Homer and Bart cruise through the former's hovercar is "I.G.Y." by Donald Fagen. The songs "Take On Me" by a-ha, "Bizarre Love Triangle" by New Order, "Incense and Peppermints" by Strawberry Alarm Clock, and "True" by Spandau Ballet are played during Bart and Lisa's prom. "Sea of Love" by Phil Phillips plays while Homer and Marge kiss in the former's aquatic home. "Lenny's Super Pet" bears a strong resemblance to Superman's pet dog, Krypto the Superdog.
Reception
In its original American broadcast, "Future-Drama" garnered roughly 8.3 million viewers. The show finished third in its original timeslot.
The episode has garnered positive reviews from critics.
Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club wrote in 2011 that the episode was "full of sweetness and funny", but he thought "Holidays of Future Passed" was better.
The episode was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour) in 2005.

Gerhard Dickel (28 October 1913 – 3 November 2017) was a German chemist and physicist. He developed a thermal diffusion method of separating isotopes with Klaus Clusius in 1938, sometimes referred to as Clusius-Dickel separation.
Biography
He was born in Augsburg. He studied under Clusius at the Institute for Physical Chemistry of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Clusius and Dickel published a paper in 1938 announcing that they had separated isotopes of neon. They had discovered that the normally inefficient thermal diffusion method – where isotopes in a fluid diffuse towards opposing hotter and colder regions – could be improved by more than four orders of magnitude if there was also an optimal convection current between the regions to avoid a steady concentration gradient and "back diffusion" developing. In 1939, the year Dickel defended his PhD thesis, the pair announced that they had also separated isotopes of chlorine with the same process. It was explored on a large scale in the USA during World War II as a possible method for separating uranium-235 from the more abundant uranium-238 in order to make an atomic bomb (the more-efficient gaseous diffusion was eventually chosen).
Dickel became a substitute manager of the Institute for Physical Chemistry, followed by a position as adjunct professor. In 1957, he became head of department at the university's Physics Institute. The same year he received the Bodenstein Prize from the German Bunsen Society for Physical Chemistry, for work on isotope exchange and on diffusion in gases and gels. He retired in 1978.
He died in 2017, aged 104.

State ownership, also called government ownership and public ownership, is the ownership of an industry, asset, or enterprise by the state or a public body representing a community, as opposed to an individual or private party. Public ownership specifically refers to industries selling goods and services to consumers and differs from public goods and government services financed out of a government's general budget. Public ownership can take place at the national, regional, local, or municipal levels of government; or can refer to non-governmental public ownership vested in autonomous public enterprises. Public ownership is one of the three major forms of property ownership, differentiated from private, collective/cooperative, and common ownership.
In market-based economies, state-owned assets are often managed and operated as joint-stock corporations with a government owning all or a controlling stake of the company's shares. This form is often referred to as a state-owned enterprise. A state-owned enterprise might variously operate as a not-for-profit corporation, as it may not be required to generate a profit; as a commercial enterprise in competitive sectors; or as a natural monopoly. Governments may also use the profitable entities they own to support the general budget. The creation of a state-owned enterprise from other forms of public property is called corporatization.
In Soviet-type economies, state property was the dominant form of industry as property. The state held a monopoly on land and natural resources, and enterprises operated under the legal framework of a nominally planned economy, and thus according to different criteria than enterprises in market and mixed economies.
Nationalization is a process of transferring private or municipal assets to a central government or state entity. Municipalization is the process of transferring private or state assets to a municipal government.
State-owned enterprise
A state-owned enterprise is a commercial enterprise owned by a government entity in a capitalist market or mixed economy. Reasons for state ownership of commercial enterprises are that the enterprise in question is a natural monopoly or because the government is promoting economic development and industrialization. State-owned enterprises may or may not be expected to operate in a broadly commercial manner and may or may not have monopolies in their areas of activity. The transformation of public entities and government agencies into government-owned corporations is sometimes a precursor to privatization.
State capitalist economies are capitalist market economies that have high degrees of government-owned businesses.
Relation to socialism
Public ownership of the means of production is a subset of social ownership, which is the defining characteristic of a socialist economy. However, state ownership and nationalization by themselves are not socialist, as they can exist under a wide variety of different political and economic systems for a variety of different reasons. State ownership by itself does not imply social ownership where income rights belong to society as a whole. As such, state ownership is only one possible expression of public ownership, which itself is one variation of the broader concept of social ownership.
In the context of socialism, public ownership implies that the surplus product generated by publicly owned assets accrues to all society in the form of a social dividend, as opposed to a distinct class of private capital owners. There is a wide variety of organizational forms for state-run industry, ranging from specialized technocratic management to direct workers' self-management. In traditional conceptions of non-market socialism, public ownership is a tool to consolidate the means of production as a precursor to the establishment of economic planning for the allocation of resources between organizations, as required by government or by the state.
State ownership is advocated as a form of social ownership for practical concerns, with the state being seen as the obvious candidate for owning and operating the means of production. Proponents assume that the state, as the representative of the public interest, would manage resources and production for the benefit of the public. As a form of social ownership, state ownership may be contrasted with cooperatives and common ownership. Socialist theories and political ideologies that favor state ownership of the means of production may be labelled state socialism.
State ownership was recognized by Friedrich Engels in Socialism: Utopian and Scientific as, by itself, not doing away with capitalism, including the process of capital accumulation and structure of wage labor. Engels argued that state ownership of commercial industry would represent the final stage of capitalism, consisting of ownership and management of large-scale production and manufacture by the state.
Within the United Kingdom, public ownership is mostly associated with the Labour Party (a centre-left democratic socialist party), specifically due to the creation of Clause IV of the "Labour Party Manifesto" in 1918. "Clause IV" was written by Fabian Society member Sidney Webb.
User rights
When ownership of a resource is vested in the state, or any branch of the state such as a local authority, individual use "rights" are based on the state's management policies, though these rights are not property rights as they are not transmissible. For example, if a family is allocated an apartment that is state owned, it will have been granted a tenancy of the apartment, which may be lifelong or inheritable, but the management and control rights are held by various government departments.
Public property
There is a distinction to be made between state ownership and public property. The former may refer to assets operated by a specific state institution or branch of government, used exclusively by that branch, such as a research laboratory. The latter refers to assets and resources that are available to the entire public for use, such as a public park (see public space).
Criticism
In neoclassical economic theory, the desirability of state ownership has been studied using contract theory. According to the property rights approach based on incomplete contracting (developed by Oliver Hart and his co-authors), ownership matters because it determines what happens in contingencies that were not considered in prevailing contracts.
The work by Hart, Shleifer and Vishny (1997) is the leading application of the property rights approach to the question whether state ownership or private ownership is desirable. In their model, the government and a private firm can invest to improve the quality of a public good and to reduce its production costs. It turns out that private ownership results in strong incentives to reduce costs, but it may also lead to poor quality. Hence, depending on the available investment technologies, there are situations in which state ownership is better. The Hart-Shleifer-Vishny theory has been extended in many directions. For instance, some authors have also considered mixed forms of private ownership and state ownership. Moreover, the Hart-Shleifer-Vishny model assumes that the private party derives no utility from provision of the public good. Besley and Ghatak (2001) have shown that if the private party (a non-governmental organization) cares about the public good, then the party with the larger valuation of the public good should always be the owner, regardless of the parties' investment technologies.
More recently, some authors have shown that the investment technology also matters in the Besley-Ghatak framework if an investing party is indispensable or if there are bargaining frictions between the government and the private party.

Thirumangai Alvar (IAST: ), also referred to as Thirumangai Mannan is the last of the 12 Alvar saints of south India, who are known for their affiliation to the Vaishnava tradition of Hinduism. He is considered one of the most learned Alvars, and the most superior Alvar in the context of composition of verses. He holds the title Narkavi Perumal, the mark of an excellent poet, and Parakala (Beyond Time).
Though he is respected as a Vaishnava saint-poet, he initially worked as a military commander, a chieftain, and then a robber. After his conversion to Vaishnavism, he confronted practitioners the sect of Shaivism, as well as Buddhism and Jainism.
Dating and hagiography
The traditional date attributed to Thirumangai is year 399 of Kali Yuga, that is 2702 or 2706 BCE, making him traditionally the last of the Alvar saints. Modern scholars have placed the Alvars in between 5th to 9th centuries based on few historical evidence. Dr. N. Subba Reddiar summarizes their views and arrives at the date 776 AD for Thirumangai, making him chronologically the eighth Alvar, though even these dates are disputed. Sakkottai Krishnaswami Aiyangar notes he is generally dated to 7th-8th century. Professor of Religion and Asian Studies, James G. Lochtefeld of Carthage College dates Thirumangai to the 9th century. He is generally considered to be a contemporary of Pallava king Nandivarman II (731 CE - 796 CE) as he refers to the later Pallavas of Pallava dynasty in his hymns.
The hagiographies detailing the life of Thirumangai and other Alvars are Divya charitam (11th century) and Guruparampara-prabhavam-arayirappadi (13th century) and Guruparampara-prabhavam-muvayirappadi (14th century). Other Vaishnava scholars have written hagiographics based on the above works later.
Early life
Thirumangai was born in the Muthuraja caste in Thirukuraiyalur, a small village in Tamil Nadu. Thirumangai's real name was Kaliyan or Kalikanti. Thirumangai's father was Nilam, a general under the Chola empire. He was skilled in archery and worked as a military commander himself for the Chola king. In recognition of his valour, he was conferred upon the title Parakala and rewarded a small terrority called Ali Nadu to govern, for his military services. Its capital was Thirumangai. He earned the title Thirumangai Mannan or chief of Thirumangai, a name he maintained even when he became a saint.
Married life
According to the traditional accounts, he fell in love with Kumudavalli, a Vaishnava doctor's adopted daughter at Thiruvellakkulam (also known as Annan Kovil). She gave a set of conditions that he must become a Vaishnavaite and that he must feed a thousand people for over a year, every day. During that process, he was so attracted to Vaishnavism that he started constructing temple walls for Srirangam. Unable to bear the heavy expense of feeding a thousand people, Kaliyan resorted to highway robbery. One day, he saw a group of people returning from a marriage, with the bride and groom. He and his assistants were able to get all the loot, but the toe ring from the groom was left. He tried to remove them, but could not do so. Then he realised the bridegroom was none other than Vishnu himself. Narayana revealed himself to Kaliyan and transformed him by teaching the Narayana mantra or Ashtakshara (the eight syllabled) – Om Namo Narayanaya, turning the robber into a saint, and starts singing the first verse of Periya Tirumoli (Vaadinen Vaadi). The temple-god of Thirunaraiyur (Naraiyur Nindra Nambi) – a form of Vishnu – is believed to have initiated Thirumangai into Vaishnavism, by teaching him the pancha samskara.
The first ten verses of Thirumangai's poem Periya Tirumoli sing of his transformation, after receiving the spiritual knowledge from Vishnu. He sings about his transformation thus:
I became a thief
deceitful and dishonest
I wandered hither and thither
yet light dawned upon me –
I reached Your feet
and instantly your grace fell upon me
with melting heart and choked voice
your praises I sing
bathed in streaming tears
I repeat day and night
the sacred name of Narayana (Vishnu)
As a Vaishnava saint
Transformed by his encounter with God, Thirumangai gave up his chieftainship and became a devout Vaishnava, dedicated to god Vishnu. To atone for his sins, he visited 88 of the Divya Desams, a group of 108 Vishnu shrines primarily in south India. He spread the poems of older Alvars in his wandering. He was also well versed in earlier Tamil literature like Naaladiyar, Thirukkural, Sangam literature, and Jain literature.
Thirumangai preached against penance and advocated bhakti (devotion) as way to attain salvation. He composed 6 poems in Tamil, together acoounting for 1361 verses. In the book Divya Prabandham, 1361 verses of Thirumangai are included, making them the most composed by any Alvar. Tamil Vaishnavas consider them as the six Tamil Vedangas or Angas of the 4 poems of Nammalvar, which are considered as Vedas. His most important work is Periya Tirumoli, composed of 1084 hymns. The others are: Tirunedunthandakam (30 verses), Tirukuruthandakam (20 verses), Tiruvelukkutirukkai (a single long poem of 47 lines), Siriya Tirumadal (155 lines) and Periya Tirumadal (297 lines).
A late ninth century text, Tamilalangaram by Dandapani Swamigal describes him of having the rare privilege of biting god Vishnu's toes and being pardoned for all his sins, as he wrote in Tamil. Vaishnavas consider him as a divine incarnation of Sharanga, Vishnu's bow.
Works
The Periya Tirumoli is the composition of hymns illustrating the greatness of Vaishnava shrines and their presiding deity as well as God's numerous attributes. His songs extol the largest number of shrines – over 40 forms of Vishnu, from Badrinath in North India to Thirukkurungudi in the extreme South. Thirumangai also discusses causes of human suffering and ways to overcome it to achieve salvation. Vedanta Desika praises the work as "a deep insight in spiritual knowledge".
The word thandakam in Tiru-nedun-thandakam and Tiru-kuru-thandakam refers to the staff used for support for climbing a hill, this refers to God as the support for sustence of the soul in context of the poems. The words nedu and kuru signify the length of the compositions and its poetic meter. In Tirunedunthandakam, Thirumangai speaks as a Nayaki (consort of the Lord), who separated from her beloved God (Nayaka). Tirukuruthandakam speaks dependency of the soul on God and its way to escape suffering with the help of Vishnu, who is the sole supporter.
Tiruvelukkutirukkai deals with the concept of surrender to God to attain freedom from suffering, the nature of God and the means of attaining Him.
Periya Tirumadal and Siriya Tirumadal use the madal, an ancient Tamil custom which is practised by a rejected lover to win back his love, though it is prohibited for women. The custom evolves singing about his love in love, devoid of food and sleep and finally trying to commit suicide before her if all things fail. Thirumangai sings as a woman threatening Lord to finish her life if He can not reciprocate her love. He assumes the role of a gopika (milkmaid) who threatens Krishna (a form of Vishnu) with madal. He defends the gopika's actions of performing the prohibited madal, by saying that he follows the Sanskrit literary tradition who permits madal for women, not the Tamil one. His songs are also based on akam love poems, and talk of employing bees and storks are messengers to God. He goes to the length of portraying himself as the nayaki, pining for the love of Vishnu.
Interaction with other faiths
Thirumangai was instrumental in the decline of Jainism in south India. He is known for building of the third wall at the Vishnu temple, Srirangam for which he melted a gold Buddha statue from the Negapatam monastery. This indicates a conflict with Buddhism. Sri Rangastavam by Parashara bhattar praises Thirumangai, who won over philosophies such as Jainism to establish the complete philosophy of Sri Vaishnavism and used the jewels and images from them to build the third wall around Srirangam Temple.
Thirumangai plundered "refractory" Shaivas (devotees of Shiva) and lived on the acquired wealth. He is described as cold-hearted Vaishnava who defeated the rival Shaivas by his words and his argumentum ad baculum. Vaishnava texts like the Divyasuri charitam and the Guruparamparai prabhavams tell of his meeting with Thirugnana sambandhar, a Shaiva saint, who went to meet Thirumangai on his own and invited Thirumangai to his home town Sirkazhi so that Thirumangai would compose a poem in praise of the local deity Thadaalan. On the request of Thirugnana sambandhar at Sirkazhi, Thirumangai composed a poem on the spot, which was admired by the Shaiva – who granted Thirumangai a trident as a mark of appreciation.
Temples
In Hampi's Vitthala temple complex, a temple was dedicated to Thirumangai.
Festival
The Thirumangai Alvar Mangalasasana utsavam(festival)in the month of Thai(Jan–Feb) witnesses 11 Garudasevai a spectacular event in which festival images idols from the 11 Thirunaangur Divyadesam shrines in the area are brought on Garuda mounts to Thirunangur. An idol of Thirumangai Alvar is also brought here on a Hamsa Vahanam(swan) and his paasurams(verses) dedicated to each of these 11 temples are recited. The Utsavar(festival deity) of Thirumangai Alvar and his consort Sri Kumudavalli Naachiyar are taken in a palanquin to each of the 11 temples, through the paddy fields in the area. The paasurams(poems) dedicated to each of the 11 Divyadesams are chanted in the respective shrines.
Legacy
The Nangur Vishnu Temples are regarded to have been sanctified by him.
K. C. Varadachari, author of Alvars of South India describes Thirumangai as:
He was a petty chieftain. He in many respects a dynamic figure, ardent in love, spectacular in his deeds, a rebel and a social reformer, even a kind of Robin Hood, and above all an exquisite lyricist.

The George Baldwin House is a historic house at 530 Foxon Road in North Branford, Connecticut. Probably built in the 1830s, its distinctive Greek Revival design has been attributed to architect Ithiel Town. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.
Description and history
The George Baldwin House stands in western North Branford, on the north side of Foxon Road (Connecticut Route 80) near its junction with Arthur Road. It is a modest single-story wood-frame structure, covered with a truncated hip roof and wooden clapboard siding. It is nearly square in plan, with a projecting entrance bay at the center of the street-facing facade. It has two Doric columns set in antis in front of the entrance, which has flanking sidelights and a transom window. The building is encircled by a broad entablature. Windows are rectangular sash, with lightly moulded framing. The interior is arranged in a central hall plan with four flanking rooms, but has little of its original decorative elements.
The construction date of this house is not known with certainty, owing to disagreements among documentary and oral history records. Based on its stylistic appearance, it was probably built in the 1830s. Its attribution to New Haven architect Ithiel Town is also uncertain, but is plausible based on the building's design, which includes academically correct proportions for its Greek Revival elements. It is also rendered plausible by the possible association of Town with Micah Baldwin, a New York City merchant who was the uncle and financial benefactor of George Baldwin, a farmer of modest means.

Nanolophodon is an extinct genus of mammal, belonging to the order Notoungulata. It lived during the Early Eocene, and its fossilized remains were discovered in what is now Brazil.
Description
This genus is only known from fragments of its maxilla and mandible, and from a few isolated teeth. The teeth were low-crowned (brachydont). The lower molars had an underdeveloped entolophid, a common characteristic with other early Notoungulates, such as Henricosbornia. The first crest, generally present in members of the suborder Typotheria, and the intermediate crest, present in members of the suborder Toxodontia, were absent. Nanolophodon was distinguished from its relatives by the presence of two small crests on the ectoloph, and a large paraconid.
Classification
Nanolophodon tutuca was first described in 2021, based on fossilized remains found in the Itaboraí Formation, in the Rio de Janeiro State of Brazil. Nanolophodon (meaning in New Latin "tooth with minuscule crest") is considered to be a basal member of the order Notoungulata, perhaps representative of the potentially paraphyletic family Henricosborniidae.

Philip Francis Sharpley (30 May 1914 – 6 September 1987) was a New Zealand track and field athlete who represented his country at the 1938 British Empire Games.
Early life and family
Born in Dublin, Ireland, on 30 May 1914, Sharpley was the son of Frederick James Sharpley and Sarah Jane Barry. The family emigrated to New Zealand in 1924, and settled in Hastings. Sharpley married Winifred Sheila Mary von Dadelszen, great-niece of Edward John von Dadelszen, at Havelock North on 30 December 1940. He married his second wife, Una May Addis, in 1950, and they had two children.
Athletics
In all, Sharpley won nine New Zealand national athletics titles: the 120 yards hurdles and 220 yards hurdles in 1934, 1936, 1939, and 1940; and the 100 yards sprint in 1930. He held the national records for the 120 yards hurdles and 220 yards hurdles, with times of 14.8 seconds and 24.4 seconds, respectively.
At the 1938 British Empire Games in Sydney, Sharpley finished sixth in the final of the men's 120 yards hurdles. In the men's 100 yards sprint, he finished second in his heat and then last in his semi-final, and did not progress further.
Sharpley became involved in athletics coaching and assisted Rona Tong with her hurdling skills in the lead-up to the 1938 British Empire Games. He coached the New Zealand athletics team at the 1950 British Empire Games in Auckland, and later coached Mary Donaghy. Sharpley was also the athletics coach for the New Zealand team at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston.
Military service
During World War II, Sharpley served with the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Anti-Tank Companies (4th reinforcements) in August 1940. At an army sports meeting in Cairo in July 1941, he won the 100 yards sprint and 220 yards hurdles events. Promoted to the rank of lieutenant, he was reported missing in August 1942, and was held as a prisoner of war in Germany. At the end of April 1945 he was reported to have returned to Britain, and held the rank of captain.
Sharpley was later a physical trainer at the Papakura Military Camp during compulsory military training in the 1950s.
Later life and death
Sharpley became a schoolteacher, and he wrote and illustrated publications for Department of Education, including Running, jumping and throwing (1950), and Athletics: a guide book for teachers, coaches and players, which was first published in 1960, and reissued in 1973 and 1978.
In retirement, Sharpley worked with his wife, Una, a noted studio potter, and also developed a home-made pug mill for mixing clay for pottery.
Sharpley died on 6 September 1987, and his ashes were buried at Papakura Cemetery.
Honorific eponym
Sharpley Place, in the Hamilton suburb of Chartwell, is named in Sharpley's honour.

Roscoe Glacier () is an Antarctic channel glacier, 12 nautical miles (22 km) long and 3 to 5 nautical miles (9 km) wide, debouching from a small valley onto the west portion of Shackleton Ice Shelf, midway between Cape Moyes and Junction Corner. Charted as a valley depression during a southern reconnaissance in March 1912 by F. Wild and other members of the Western Base Party of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition under Mawson. Delineated from aerial photographs taken by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump, 1946–47, and named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for John H. Roscoe, geographer, author of Antarctic Bibliography (Washington, 1951), and scientific advisor to the director of the United States Antarctic Program. Roscoe served as photogrammetrist with the central task group of U.S. Navy Operation Highjump, 1946–47, and with U.S. Navy Operation Windmill, 1947–48, and assisted the latter group in establishing astronomical control stations along Wilhelm II, Queen Mary, Knox and Budd Coasts.

Nummus (, noummos), plural nummi () is a Latin term meaning "coin", but used technically by modern writers for a range of low-value copper coins issued by the Roman and Byzantine empires during Late Antiquity. It comes from the Greek nomos via its Western Doric form noummos, which was used to describe a coin in some parts of southern Italy. The word was also used during the later years of the Roman Republic and the early Empire, either as a general word for a coin, or to describe the sestertius, which was the standard unit for keeping accounts.
History
In circa 294 AD, during the Tetrarchy, a new large bronze coin of circa 10 grams weight and 30 mm diameter appeared. Its official name was apparently nummus, although it has until recently been known among numismatists as the follis. The term nummus is now usually applied solely to the 5th–7th century Byzantine issues. These were small, badly struck coins, weighing less than 1 gram, forming the lowest denomination of Byzantine coinage. They were valued officially at 1⁄7,200 of the gold solidus but more usually rated to 1⁄6,000 or 1⁄12,000. The nummus usually featured the profile of the reigning Byzantine emperor on the obverse and the Byzantine imperial monogram on the reverse, although some coins of Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) display its numerical value by the Greek numeral "A" instead.
Higher denominations
In 498, Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491–518) reformed the coinage (carried out by the comes sacrarum largitionum John the Paphlagonian) by introducing multiples of the nummus, with denominations of 40 nummi, also known as a follis, 20 nummi (semifollis), 10 nummi (Greek: δεκανούμμιον, decanummium). These were also marked with Greek numerals representing their value: "M" for the follis, "K" for the semifollis and "I" for the decanummium. On the other hand, it appears that issue of the simple nummus was discontinued. In 513, the weights of these coins were doubled, the pentanummium (Greek: πεντανούμμιον, 5-nummi coin marked with "E") introduced, and the minting of single nummi resumed.
Decreasing value
In 538–539, Emperor Justinian I introduced further changes to the 40-nummi follis, raising its weight to 25 grams. It was reduced again to 22.5 grams in 541/542, and further reductions followed until the century's end. At this time, a new 30-nummi coin (marked with "Λ" or "XXX") was introduced, but the single follis had ceased to be struck at Constantinople. It survived in the Exarchate of Carthage well into the 7th century however. During the 7th century, the successive military and financial crises led to further reduction in the weight and a marked deterioration of the quality of bronze coinage; by the time of Emperor Constans II (r. 641–668), a follis weighed only 3 grams. Consequently, the denominations lower than the semifollis were practically unmintable and abandoned. Thereafter, the term nummus remained in use as a notional unit for 1⁄6,000 of the solidus, and in colloquial usage for "small change".
Use of term
Variations of the term nummus appear in medical language, plant taxonomy, and fossil taxonomy:
Arctostaphylos nummularia
Atriplex nummularia
Biscogniauxia nummularia

The World Movement of Christian Workers (Mouvement Mondial des Travailleurs Chrétiens) is the Catholic Church's officially recognized association for Catholic workingmen and women. It is a member organization of Vatican's Conference of International Catholic Organizations. The World Movement of Christian Workers (WMCW/MMTC) does not have individual members but is a federation of various national movements. The affiliate in the United States is the Catholic Labor Network. In the UK, it is the Movement of Christian Workers.
WMCW/MMTC activities are educational and evangelistic. The Movement bases its commitment on faith in Jesus Christ, the Gospel and the social teaching of the Catholic Church. It is committed to working together with others - regardless of race, culture or creed - to improve their living conditions and build up a society without exclusions. The approach used by the Movement is based on the method developed by Joseph Cardijn to "see-judge-act".
The world headquarters of the Movement is in Brussels, Belgium. French is the working language of the headquarters.
History
Prior to World War II, in many European countries there developed different labor federations for Catholics, Socialists, Communists and liberals. All of these unions were abolished by the Nazi or other Right-Wing regimes in Axis Europe. The Vatican and others believed this division in the labor movement weakened its ability to defeat Nazism and other Right Wing totalitarian movements. After World War II, the Vatican discouraged re-formation of "Christian trade unions" (i.e. Catholic aligned labor unions) although it was not always successful. As an alternative to Catholic-based unions that negotiated contracts and represented workers to management, Christian worker associations were created as an educational, spiritual and social action movement rather than as a specific labor union. In the 1950s, the Catholic workers' associations of Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands decided to join forces to create an international structure to encourage exchanges and knowledge between individuals and different situations; to stimulate solidarity between workers' movements; to foster the spread of Christian workers' movements in the world; and to develop the apostolate in the labor world. In 1966, to coincide with the 75th anniversary of Rerum Novarum, it was given official recognition by the Holy See.

The yellow-throated woodpecker (Piculus flavigula) is a species of bird in the family Picidae, the woodpeckers, piculets, and wrynecks.
It is found in northern and central South America in Brazil and the entire Amazon Basin; also in the Guianas, and Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. Besides the Amazon Basin, it is found in the southeast basin in the adjoining Tocantins-Araguaia River drainage; on the east at the edge of its range there, it only occurs in the headwaters of the Tocantins, then recontinues at the joining of the Araguaia-Tocantins as it goes to the Atlantic Ocean.
Two separated disjunct populations occur in Brazil at the southeast coastal regions (parts of the Caatinga). The largest group extends for 1,500 km; the smaller, only about 200 km. In Venezuela, it is found in the east and southeast and covers most of the Orinoco River drainage.
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest and subtropical or tropical swamps.
Taxonomy
The yellow-throated woodpecker was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in French Guiana. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle, which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name, but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Picus flavigula in his catalogue of the Planches Enluminées. The yellow-throated woodpecker is now placed in the genus Piculus that was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Baptist von Spix in 1824. The generic name is a diminutive of the Latin word Picus meaning "woodpecker". The specific epithet flavigula combines the Latin flavus meaning "yellow" and gula meaning "throat".
Three subspecies are recognised:
P. f. flavigula (Boddaert, 1783) – eastern Colombia and southern Venezuela through the Guianas, northern Brazil
P. f. magnus (Cherrie & Reichenberger, 1921) – northeastern Ecuador and southeastern Colombia to northern Bolivia, western Brazil
P. f. erythropis (Vieillot, 1818) – eastern and southeastern Brazil

Holmes Conrad (January 31, 1840 – September 4, 1915) was an American politician, lawyer and military officer.
Early life
Conrad was born in Winchester, Virginia. He was the son of Robert Young Conrad, a prominent lawyer of Winchester, and state attorney general from 1857 to 1862; his mother was Elizabeth Whiting, daughter of Burr Powell. After attending the Virginia Military Institute, Conrad proceeded in 1858 to the University of Virginia.
At the outbreak of the Civil War he enlisted as a private in Company A, 1st Virginia Cavalry and saw active service throughout the war. He was commissioned a lieutenant and was appointed adjutant in August 1862. In 1864 he became major and assistant inspector general of Thomas Rosser's cavalry division, serving there until the end of the war.
Career
In 1865 Conrad commenced the study of law in his father's office in Winchester, and on his admission to the Virginia bar in January 1866, joined his father's practice. In 1878, he was elected to the Virginia legislature, serving until 1882. Over the next few years, he became one of the leaders of the Virginia bar and acquired an influential position in the councils of the Democratic Party. In 1890, Conrad was a charter member of The Virginia Bar Association. In 1893 President Grover Cleveland appointed him Assistant Attorney General of the U.S., and in 1895 he became Solicitor General.
When he left the position of Solicitor General in 1897, Conrad was retained by President William McKinley on behalf of the Federal government in Morris v. U.S. In October 1901 he joined the law faculty of Georgetown University as lecturer on the history of English law. In 1904 Conrad was again retained on behalf of the Federal government as a special prosecutor in the Postal Fraud Cases. During the last 20 years of his life he was constantly engaged in appeals before the Supreme Court of the United States, including United States v. Wong Kim Ark.
He achieved his greatest success in the last case he was engaged on, Commonwealth of Virginia v. State of West Virginia, involving the amount of the contributive share that the latter state should pay toward the public debt of the former. Appearing as counsel for Virginia, Conrad's argument upon demurrer in the Supreme Court (206 U.S. 290) was in professional circles considered remarkable. Judgment was ultimately given against West Virginia for $12,393,929. For this complicated litigation he was specially retained by the bond-holding creditors.
Conrad was of striking appearance, tall of stature with an erect military bearing. Though wielding great political influence in his state, he did not care for public office. By nature somewhat of an aristocrat and reserved in manner, he was never what some might call a "good mixer". Although that may be, serving as his comrade, Maj. Foxhall Daingerfield's, best man as Daingerfield's Nov., 1864 wedding, when Daingerfield said the part of the Episcopal service, to Nettie Gray, his bride, "I do thee with all my worldly good endow," Conrad blurted out, "There goes DiVernon!", the Major's warhorse. (The Major went back to war, but DiVernon didn't.) As a lawyer he excelled in discussing constitutional questions, and was at his best in appellate work before the Supreme Court. He had an extreme distaste for routine office work. Holmes Conrad was married twice and had seven children. After his death in 1915, he was buried in Mt. Hebron Cemetery in Winchester, Virginia.

Evagetes crassicornis is a kleptoparasitic spider wasp with a holarctic distribution.
Description
A red and black spider hunting wasp with fairly short and thick antennae with well-developed sensory powers which it uses to identify the nests of other spider wasps and tarsal combs on the forelegs for digging into these nests.
Biology
In Great Britain and Ireland the flight period is May to September. E. crassicornis is a kleptoparasitic species probably preying on various species of spider wasp, although specific hosts have not been identified. It is thought that in Britain the hosts are Arachnospila anceps and Anoplius nigerrimus, and there is a European record of Arachnospila trivialis being parasitised. E. crassicornis spends a lot of time searching for the nests of its host species on open sunny ground. Once the host's nest has been invaded E. crassicornis eats the hosts's egg and lays its own on the paralysed spider and then reseals the host's nest.
Adult E. crassicornis visit a wide variety of open flowers which have short corollae, especially Apiaceae and Asteraceae.
Habitat
Although E. crassicornis shows a preference for sandy habitats, it may be encountered on areas of open ground within a variety of habitats.
Distribution
Northern and central Europe east to central Asia also in North America.
Taxonomy
E. crassicornis forms a group with the closely related E.sahlbergii and E.orientalis. It also has two subspecies which are
E.c.crassicornis (Shuckard)
E.c. consimilis (Banks) which is found only in western North America, E.c crassicornis replaces it in the east and north of that continent.

Augustin Ahimana is a Rwandan Anglican bishop. He is a bishop in the Province of the Anglican Church of Rwanda. He is Head of Planning and Development for the Province of the Episcopal Church of Rwanda. Bishop Ahimana built a team for the Athens Olympics in 2004. He was consecrated bishop of the Kivu Diocese on 21 December 2008.
Attack on humanitarian organizations
Writing in the magazine Christianity Today, Ahimana rejected criticism of the Rwandan government by non-governmental organizations:
It is also our duty to inform American Christians that there has been a malicious campaign to demonize Rwanda's leaders, distorting the political situation. This distortion emanates from people often hiding behind so-called humanitarian organizations. Some have a hidden agenda of distracting the international community so that their own role in Rwanda's tragedy cannot be exposed.
Defense of Rwandan invasions of the DRC
Bishop Ahimana defended the Rwandan invasions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which led to the First Congo War and the Second Congo War:
When Rwandan troops decided to pursue the genocidal forces and their sponsors in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 1996 and 1998, they did so in the light of day. The peace we enjoy today in our country is mainly a consequence of that action.

Fusion Tower, formerly known as Froomsgate House, is a high student accommodation building in central Bristol, England, situated at the junction of Rupert Street with Lewin's Mead.
History
Froomsgate House was completed in 1971 as a 15-storey office building. The building had of office space and was serviced by three lifts. There were also three floors of car-parking. The building was owned by Froomsgate House Realty Ltd and managed by Hartnell Taylor Cook LLP. The name derives from an ancient city gate by the River Frome which once stood on the site. Notable tenants include the Crown Prosecution Service Southwest.
On the first floor of the building is a mosaic mural map, the Froomsgate Map, executed by artist Phillipa Threlfall. This artwork was commissioned by the developer Laing Development owned by John Laing plc. The map depicts the surrounding area in 1673 as originally shown in James Millerd's map of that date. It is sited on the first floor as it was originally envisaged that Froomsgate House would be linked to other surrounding buildings by elevated walkways.
In 2014, Fusion Students, a property developer, converted and redeveloped the building into 480 bed student accommodation. It involved adding two new floors on top of existing roof level of the building. The accommodation building includes three to six-bedroom apartments, studio flats, a gym, a concierge service, a cinema, games area and off-street parking.

Serge Souchon-Koguia (born 12 October 1987) is a Central African Republican footballer who plays as a midfielder. He has represented the Central African Republic on two occasions, both in 2011.
Career
Souchon-Koguia signed for Étoile FC in 2010. He made his debut during the 2010 S.League season against Albirex Niigata (S) in a 0–0 draw.
In 2012, he moves to Tanjong Pagar United after Étoile FC withdrew from the S.League citing youth commitment reasons.
Controversy
Souchon-Koguia was involved in the controversial match for Étoile FC against Hougang United which was called off before kick-off when an all in brawl erupted during the pre-match warm up. Details of the fracas are sketchy, however it is believed the fight started when Souchon-Koguia's team-mate, Hadama Bathily entered the Hougang's warm up area to retrieve a miss-kicked ball. Bathily then attacked Hougang's assistant coach Hasrin Jailani after it was claimed by Bathili that he was racially abused by Jailani. Both teams then rushed to defend their respective team members where the fight escalated.
The Football Association of Singapore set up a disciplinary committee to investigate and punish the individuals responsible for causing the melee. Both clubs received $10,000 in fines, of which $5,000 was suspended until the end of season. Three Hougang members, including the assistant coach received fines and suspensions. Souchon-Koguia himself, received a five-match ban, and a $1,500-dollar fine for committing an assault on Hougang player Basit Abdul Hamid.
International career
In 2011, Souchon-Koguia was called up to the Central African Republic national football team for a friendly against Malta on 11 August 2011. He played the full 90 minutes, in which Malta ran out 2–1 winners.
Souchon-Koguia was called up for a second time, by CAR manager Jules Accorsi, this time for a crucial 2012 African Cup of Nations qualification match against Morocco. The Central African Republic, who at the time were tied with Morocco on first, needed to win the game in order to progress through to the 2012 African Cup of Nations, however a 0–0 draw would see them finish 2nd in the group, after losing to Algeria in the next match, in which he was not called up for.

The Dynali Helicopter Company is a Belgian aircraft manufacturer. The company specializes in the design and manufacture of microlight helicopters in the form of kits for amateur construction and ready-to-fly aircraft.
The production plant is located 30 km south of Brussels, in the Thines district of Nivelles.
The company chairman is Thierry Blanchart.
History
The company was founded in the early 1980s as just Dynali. It started as a fixed wing ultralight aircraft builder, constructing over 1000 Dynali Chickinox aircraft.
As new materials became available, such as carbon fibre, the company raised the capital from a shareholder to branch out into helicopter design and the name was changed to the Dynali Helicopter Company. New European microlight helicopter regulations introduced in 2011 allowed production to start and the company produced the H2 and later the H3. The H3 became the sole product in the mid 2010s, superseding the H2 in production.
Dynali helicopters have been sold in France and South Korea.

John R. Lewis College is one of the ten residential colleges at the University of California, Santa Cruz. It is on the north side of campus, west of College Nine and north of the Cowell Student Health Center. The theme of its freshman core course is Social Justice and Community.
Lewis College is home to the University Center, a conference center located above the Dining Commons, and the Terry Freitas cafe, a student-run co-op cafe named after UCSC-alumni Terry Freitas, who was murdered in Colombia due to his work with the U'wa people to stop oil companies from drilling on U'wa land.
In 2010, students and staff worked together to name the three residential halls. They are called Angela Davis House, after the American political activist and UCSC professor, Angela Davis; Ohlone House, after the native Ohlone people who are indigenous to the region; and Amnesty House, after Amnesty International and their work for human rights.
The construction of Colleges Nine and Ten in 1992 caused a furor among students, as the planned construction site called for the destruction of a region of forest known as Elfland. Rife with unique student-built fantasy structures, the demolition of most Elfland sparked student protests, resulting in several arrests .
College Ten was founded in 2002, making it the newest UCSC college as of May 2017. On October 27, 2021, Chancellor Cynthia Larive announced that the university will be renaming College Ten after civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis. The name change will be made official with a ceremony to be held in spring 2022.

Bunnawarra or Bunnawarra Station is a pastoral lease operating as a sheep station in Western Australia.
It is located south of Yalgoo and east of Mullewa in the Mid-West region.
The property was initially established by Thomas P. Morrissey and his brother John F. Morrissey with their partner William Mooney in 1902. Mooney was later replaced by other members of the Morrissey family, Peter, William and Michael Morrissey forming the Morrissey Brothers partnership.
The property was well established by 1909 and was produced 80 bales of wool in that year, and 88 bales in 1912.
A flock of approximately 10,000 sheep were grazing the property in 1919. The Morrissey brothers had a good season in 1922, producing 127 bales of wool, and acquired Anketell Station near Paynesville later the same year. By 1925 the station produced 159 bales.
Michael Francis Morrissey died in 1927 in Mullewa. Morrissey and his wife were pioneers of the district and had previously worked at Yarragadee and Gullewa stations before settling at Bunnawarra. His wife, Jane, died in 1934, leaving their sons in charge of their pastoral interests. The sons T.P., J.F. and A. Morrissey were managing Bunnawarra, W. H. and M. J. Morrisset were running Noongall station, and P. M. Morrissey was overseeing Anketell Station.
The family partnership, Morrissey Brothers, was dissolved in 1938 with Thomas Patrick Morrissey, John Francis Morrissey and Michael Joseph Morrissey still carrying on business on their own account at Bunnawarra Station. The other family members remained at Anketell or Noongall or were paid out.

"If 60's Was 90's" is a song by Beautiful People. Recorded in 1991, the song was first released on their album If 60's Were 90's in 1992 but was not released as a single until 1994 after the success of "Rilly Groovy", charting at #74 on the UK Singles Chart and #5 on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart.
Background
The song was written by group-leader Du Kane, with the programming done by Luke Baldry at Kane's mother's house in Sussex. The song is a downtempo cover version of Jimi Hendrix's "If 6 Was 9", sampling vocals and drums from said song and from The Dick Cavett Show, and copious amounts of blues guitar from Voodoo Chile including its entire final solo at the end. The song has live drums with bandmembers augmenting the drum samples from "If 6 Was 9"; in a blog post, Baldry explained that the style of the song required the rhythm section to have been more rigid than the take they sampled, and to combat said woes the then-ubiquitous Akai S1000 sampler was used to take a six-track sample of "If 6 Was 9"'s drums and drop it across the entire drum track. Multiple attempts were necessary because, according to Baldry, the Akai at the time was incapable of behaving as a stereo sampler, despite its claims to the contrary, because it didn't know how to lock the phase correlation and as a result every time a stereo sample was triggered the relationship between left and right was different. (This is fixed by turning on "note-on sample coherence", although this delays the note start.)
Music video
A music video was shot for the song. It was directed by Richard Heslop in March 1994 at his house in Hammersmith and Notting Hill and features Jimi Hendrix Jnr, a friend of the band, miming to the final solo.

Dryobalanops lanceolata is a species of plant in the family Dipterocarpaceae. The species name is derived from Latin ( = shaped like the head of a spear) and refers to the shape of the leaf. This species is endemic to Borneo. It is common in protected areas, although elsewhere it has suffered modest population decline due to logging and land conversion.
It is an immense emergent tree, up to 80 m tall, found in mixed dipterocarp forest on clay-rich soils. It is a heavy hardwood sold under the timber trade name kapur.

Tsunda Church () is a church in Tsunda, near Tmogvi fortress in the Samtskhe–Javakheti region of Georgia.
History
Tsunda Church, dedicated to St John the Baptist, dates back to the 12th-13th centuries. In this vicinity, there are natural hot water springs and terraced gardens. The church stands on the site of the ancient city Tsunda.
The hall church was erected on the top of a high rock by Ichkit Gurgenisdze, as it is written above the western entrance. Its basement contains a crypta. The decorations are rather poor, except the door and window frames. The portal with reliefs was added some time after the church construction.
As common for such churches the vault is of barrel-chamber type, and the apse with conch is in the eastern part of the interior. Original frescoes are nearly destroyed.

Gasparinisuchus is an extinct genus of peirosaurid notosuchian known from the Late Cretaceous (Santonian to early Campanian stage) of Neuquén and Mendoza Provinces, western central Argentina. It contains a single species, Gasparinisuchus peirosauroides.
Discovery
Gasparinisuchus is known only from two individuals. The holotype MOZ 1750 PV represented by partial skull and lower jaws with teeth and various associated postcranial skeleton including vertebrae and dermal plates which are currently missing. It was originally described by Gasparini (1982) and Gasparini et al. (1991) and referred to Peirosaurus torminni. MOZ 1750 PV was found in the Loma de la Lata locality of the Neuquén Province, Patagonia. It was originally reported as collected from sediments of the Rio Colorado Subgroup, Neuquén Group. Later, Hugo and Leanza (2001) noted that this specimen was actually collected from the underlying Portezuelo Formation of the Rio Neuquén Subgroup, Neuquén Group. More recent stratigraphic work on this area identified that horizon as belonging to the younger, Coniacian-age, Plottier Formation of the Rio Neuquén Subgroup. This horizon is currently considered pertaining to the Santonian-age Bajo de la Carpa Formation of the Rio Colorado Subgroup.
The referred specimen, PV-CRIDC-12, represented by right premaxilla and maxilla, isolated teeth, and part of the postcranial skeleton. It was originally tentatively referred to P. torminni by Praderio et al. (2009). It was found in the Área de Cañadón Amarrillo locality, of the Mendoza Province, Patagonia. It was collected from the slightly younger early Campanian-age Anacleto Formation, also part of the Neuquén Group.
Description
The type species G. peirosauroides was described and named in 2012 on the basis of MOZ 1750 PV, which was originally referred to Peirosaurus torminni. PV-CRIDC-12 was also excluded from P. torminni and referred to Gasparinisuchus on the basis of similarities to the holotype. The maxilla of PV-CRIDC-12 shares a number of derived features with Gasparinisucus, indicating a tall, broad snout, maxillary teeth implanted in discrete alveoli, a convex alveolar maxillary edge at the level of the third tooth and similar position and relative size of the maxillary teeth. Comprarisons with the holotype of P. torminni are uninformative because the premaxilla of PV-CRIDC-12 is poorly preserved. Gasparinisuchus differs from other peirosaurids in having a broad snout and in lacking an antorbital fenestra. Although overlapping materials between the Gasparinisuchus and P. torminni limited to the premaxilla and the dentition, Gasparinisuchus can be differentiated from Peirosaurus on the basis of its broad, rounded rostrum, anteroposteriorly short premaxilla, reduced perinareal fossa, and short premaxillary interdental spaces. Peirosaurus is known from the late Maastrichtian (the latest Cretaceous) of Brazil, and the presence of MOZ 1750 PV in Argentina was originally taken as evidence for a link between Brazilian and Argentinian Late Cretaceous faunas. The removal of MOZ 1750 PV from the genus Peirosaurus suggests that the older Argentinian and younger Brazilian faunas were mostly distinct. The phylogenetic position of MOZ 1750 PV was previously tested in several recent analyses under the taxon name P. torminni. The following cladogram simplified after a comprehensive analysis of notosuchians presented by Alan H. Turner and Joseph J. W. Sertich in 2010.
Etymology
Gasparinisuchus was first described and named by Agustín G. Martinelli, Joseph J.W. Sertich, Alberto C. Garrido and Ángel M. Praderio in 2012 and the type species is Gasparinisuchus peirosauroides. The generic name honors the vertebrate paleontologist Zulma Brandoni de Gasparini for her work on South American crocodyliforms, and suchus from the Greek Souchos, which refers to the Egyptian crocodile-headed god Sobek. The specific name is derived from Peirosaurus, the type genus of the Peirosauridae to which specimens of Gasparinisuchus were initially assigned, and from Greek ides meaning shaped. It refers to the importance of the holotype specimen as the basis for the designation of the Family Peirosauridae by Gasparini (1982).

Llanfair Talhaiarn (), abbreviated to Llanfair TH, is a village and community approximately south of Abergele in Conwy county borough, Wales. Until 1974 it was included in Denbighshire.
The village derives its name from the church ("Llan") dedicated to Mary ("Mair", altered in this compound word to "Fair", hence "Llanfair"), that was founded by a monk called Talhaiarn from Valle Crucis Abbey (according to local legend). The original church has long disappeared.
The poet and architect John Jones (January 1810 – October 1869) was born at the Harp Inn (now known as Hafod y Gân) in Llanfair. He took the bardic name "Talhaiarn", and there is a popular misconception that this was the origin of the name of the village. However, the name of the village is documented long before Jones's birth.
The village is situated on the flood plain of the River Elwy (Afon Elwy). The population was 979 in 2001, increasing to 1,070 at the 2011 census with 44% being Welsh language speakers. The community includes the hamlet of Moelfre, Conwy and Moelfre Path near Abergele Hospital.
Llanfair is accessible from the Abergele to Llanrwst road via an ancient three arch bridge that spans the Elwy and leads directly into the heart of the village, where it can be found two old pubs, The Black Lion and The Swan Inn.
About 100 yards north of the old bridge is a more modern bridge that carries the main Abergele to Llansannan road across the river.
Nearby is Mynydd Bodran, a 287 m (942 ft) hill which towers above the River Elwy. From the hill are fine views of Snowdonia and the North Wales coast. Other nearby hills include Moelfre Isaf and Moelfre Uchaf.
The village was once part of the estate of Garthewin. The first written records of Garthewin date to the fourteenth century,
but both that house and a later Jacobean house were replaced in the 18th century by the present building,
which was subsequently altered in 1930 by Clough Williams-Ellis. It was from the 18th century until the late 20th the home of the Wynne family and notable for a private theatre constructed in the stables by R.O.F. Wynne which in the 1950s saw the first performances of several of Saunders Lewis's dramas.

The Blackfoot LDS Tabernacle, also known as the Blackfoot Tabernacle or South Blackfoot Stake Tabernacle is a building located in Blackfoot, Idaho that formerly served as a tabernacle for large gatherings of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The tabernacle was designed by architects Hyrum Pope and Harold W. Burton and completed in 1921. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. In 1980 the church sold the building to the city of Blackfoot. It was used as a civic auditorium until the 90's and sat until 2003. In 2003 local business owner Perry Hawker bought it and it now functions as the Hawker Funeral Home.

Abhimanyu Mishra (born February 5, 2009) is an American chess grandmaster. A chess prodigy, he became the youngest player ever to qualify for the grandmaster title on June 30, 2021, at the age of 12 years 4 months and 25 days, beating Sergey Karjakin's record which had stood since 2002.
Career
He broke the United States Chess Federation record for youngest Expert by earning a 2000 USCF rating at the age of 7 years, 6 months, and 22 days, breaking the record of Awonder Liang. He then broke the US Chess record for youngest National Master by earning a 2200 USCF rating at the age of 9 years, 2 months, and 17 days, breaking the record of Liran Zhou. He holds the world record for the youngest International Master, a title which he earned in November 2019 at the age of 10 years, 9 months, and 20 days, breaking the record of Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa. FIDE awarded him the title in February 2020.
In March 2021, Mishra tied for first place with GM Vladimir Belous in the Charlotte Chess Center's Spring 2021 GM Norm Invitational held in Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S., with a score of 5.5/9 and crossed 2400 FIDE for the first time on an official rating list but failed to achieve a GM norm.
To become a grandmaster, a player must score three GM norms (each norm is scored by achieving a performance rating of over 2600 in a tournament) and exceed a rating of 2500. In April 2021, Mishra tied for first place at the Vezérképző GM tournament in Budapest, Hungary, with a score of 7.0/9 and performance rating of 2603, earning his first GM norm. In May 2021, Mishra earned clear first place at the First Saturday GM tournament in Budapest, Hungary, with a score of 8.0/9 and performance rating of 2739, having clinched his second GM norm with one round to spare and exceeding the norm by a full point. In June 2021, Mishra earned clear first place at the Vezérképző GM Mix tournament in Budapest, Hungary, with a score of 7.0/9 and a performance rating of 2619; giving him his third GM norm. As his rating had also crossed 2500, this third norm made Mishra the youngest Grandmaster in chess history, breaking the record of Sergey Karjakin by over 2 months.
Mishra received congratulations from many players, including former record holder Karjakin and World Champion Magnus Carlsen. A New York Times article cited concerns from Nigel Short and Bruce Pandolfini about the methods used to achieve the feat, alleging that the GM qualification structure encourages "norm" tournaments that narrowly qualify as prestigious enough to count as a GM norm, but no tougher, to make a strong performance from the candidate easier to achieve, noting that the average rating of Mishra's opponents' was noticeably lower in Hungary than in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Elbmarsch (Northern Low Saxon: Elvmasch) is a Samtgemeinde ("collective municipality") in the district of Harburg, in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is situated on the southern (left) bank of the river Elbe, approx. 30 km southeast of Hamburg, and 20 km north of Lüneburg. Its seat is in the village Marschacht. The name refers to the marshes (German: Marsch) along the Elbe.
The Samtgemeinde Elbmarsch consists of the following municipalities:
Drage
Marschacht
Tespe
Cancer cluster
Elbmarsch is the epicenter of a notable pediatric cancer cluster that persisted for over 15 years. Although a sparsely populated region a high rate of childhood leukemia was observed with an incidence in the region that is significantly higher compared to Germany as a whole. Ten more cases were identified than were expected throughout the period. No unique hazards have been identified. The community is surrounded by two nuclear establishments. A possible accidental release of radionuclides in 1986 was hypothesized.
Ionizing radiation is another exposure conclusively linked with childhood leukemia. Survivors (within 1000 m) of Hiroshima and Nagasaki developed leukemia 20 times more frequently than in unexposed populations.
The Krümmel Nuclear Power Plant began operations near Elbmarsch, Germany in 1983. Like Fallon, Nevada, the nearby population is quite small, including approximately 9,000 children within 10 km of the plant. Over a one and a half year period, six cases of leukemia and one case of aplastic anemia were identified among children in this area, a 41.5 increase over national incidence rates. Four more cases were diagnosed during a subsequent two-year period. Public health officials began to suspect that high levels of airborne tritium “might be involved either directly or as an indicator for earlier releases of other short-lived radionuclides”. Anti-nuclear activists believed it was due to the nuclear plant, which led to several investigations. The reported discovery of small spherical beads of nuclear material in the area led to further concern, as well as the presence of minute amounts of plutonium in the Elbe. The origins of the nuclear material were disputed, with one report determining them to not be that of the Krümmel plant. Another report claimed that they may have come from an undisclosed fire in 1986, however this theory has been questioned as it would have required a substantial government coverup. The Chernobyl disaster has also been suggested as a source, though is considered unlikely. The probable source of the material, especially in the Elbe, is nuclear reprocessing plants in France. A 2010 report exonerated the nuclear power plants on the Elbe as the cause of contamination. Further doubt was cast on the nature of the supposed beads of nuclear material, with a Federal commission chastising the original commission that claimed to have discovered the beads. The exact cause of the increased leukemia cases remains unknown, and could be due to other environmental factors, or even by chance.
The community surrounding the Savannah River nuclear facility in the U.S. was chosen for comparison with the “cluster” noted around the Kruemmel site. The tritium burden around the Savannah River site is significantly higher than the measured burden in Germany; however, the incidence of leukemia in South Carolina was not increased. Differences in population density, proximity to the power plant, and route of tritium exposure (inhalational versus oral via drinking water) may account for the lack of correlation between the two sites, or there may be alternative explanations for the increased incidence of hematopoietic malignancy between 1989 and 1991 in Elbmarsch.
Some of these alternative hypotheses have included electromagnetic fields, parental radiation exposure prior to conception, other carcinogens, and benzene exposure; however, none have been supported by the existing evidence. Intriguingly, a larger case-control study in Lower Saxony found a correlation between the “untrained immune system” (as judged as contact with other children, vaccinations, etc.) and leukemia risk, suggested that an immature immune system that has not been challenged is at greater risk for developing malignancy, possibly secondary to an undefined environment insult.

Martyrs' Square ( ; ), historically known as "Al Burj" or "Place des Cannons", is the historical central public square of Beirut, Lebanon.
Like the Martyr's Square in Damascus, it is named after the 6 May 1916 executions ordered by Djemal Pasha during World War I.
Overview
In 1931, the historic square took its name to commemorate the martyrs executed there under Ottoman rule. In the 1950s, the square became a popular venue for cinemas and coffee-houses. During the Lebanese Civil War, it was part of the demarcation line that divided the city in half.
Construction
Initially named Sahat al-Burj, the Municipality of Beirut modernized the square in 1878 as the main meeting place of the city. Beshara Effendi designed a garden with fountain and kiosks, overlooked by the Petit Serail - the seat of Beirut's governor general – as well as public buildings and souks. After that, the square underwent a lot of transformations until 1931, where it took the name of Martyrs' Square in commemoration of the martyrs executed there under Ottoman rule and a monument was erected. In 1950, the Petit Serail was demolished. The new Rivoli cinema blocked the link between the square and the harbor. Martyrs' Square became Beirut's bus and taxi terminus and a popular venue for cinemas, coffee-houses, modest hotels and the red-light district. During the Civil War (1975-1990), Martyrs' Square formed the demarcation line that divided the city in half. In 2005, an international competition was launched for the design of a new square with its axis open to the sea, reestablishing Martyrs' Square as Beirut's premier public space and heart of the capital.
History
Martyrs' Square originated as an open space (maydan) beyond the city wall. The ancient watchtower of Burj al-Kashef marked its outer limit, and gave the square its first and still surviving name, Sahat al-Burj (Tower Square).
In 1773, a Russian cannon placed near the Burj caused the square's name to be changed to ‘Place du Canon' (Cannon Square). It became ‘Place des Canons' (Cannons Square) in 1860, when the initial Russian cannon was replaced by cannons from the French fleet. Named ‘Hamidiyyeh Square' in 1884 to honor Sultan Abdul Hamid II, it became ‘Union Square' and then ‘Freedom Square' with the advent of the Young Turks revolution of 1908. In 1931, the square took the name it still officially bears today, Martyrs' Square, to commemorate the martyrs executed there under Ottoman rule and the Martyrs' Monument, Beirut was erected.
First enclosed as a formal urban space in the 1860s, the Municipality of Beirut modernized the square in 1878 as the main meeting place of the city. Beshara Effendi designed a garden with fountain and kiosks, overlooked by the Petit Serail - the seat of Beirut's governor general – as well as public buildings and souks. The tramway, built in 1906, placed the square at the center of Beirut's transport network. During the early years of the French Mandate, the Duraffourd and subsequent Danger Plans created the ‘Place de l'Etoile' (Etoile Square). They proposed the demolition of the Petit Serail to open Martyrs' Square to the sea, an ambition that was foiled. The square was neglected and Etoile Square became the geographic and administrative center of the capital.
In 1931, it was renamed Martyrs' Square after those executed there on 6 May 1916, in the last years of Ottoman rule. The nationalists were a cross-confessional group that were fighting for Lebanon's autonomy and independence:

The first Monument aux Martyrs was commissioned by the French Mandate authorities and unveiled on 19 December 1930, on the twentieth anniversary of the declaration of the state of Greater Lebanon. However, the statue by Youssef Hoyek - which became known as Les Pleureuses or the weeping women - was deeply unpopular after independence for its depiction of grieving Christian and Muslim mothers joining hands over a cremation urn. It was attacked with a hammer in 1948 before being finally removed in 1953, and is now displayed outside the Sursock Museum.
The more triumphant Martyrs' Monument by Marino Mazzacuratti was inaugurated in 1960.
In 1950, the Petit Serail was demolished. The new Rivoli cinema blocked the link between the square and the harbor. Martyrs' Square became Beirut's bus and taxi terminus and a popular venue for cinemas, coffee-houses, modest hotels and the red-light district.
During the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990), the demarcation line that divided Beirut into east and west ran through Martyrs' Square.
In 2005, an international competition was launched for the design of a new square with its axis open to the sea, reestablishing Martyrs' Square as Beirut's premier public space and heart of the capital.
In late 2019, Martyrs' Square became a major focal point of the anti-government protests.

Whitehead's trogon (Harpactes whiteheadi) is a species of bird in the family Trogonidae. It is endemic to the island of Borneo, where it is an uncommon in primary mountain forest. One of Borneo's largest trogons at long, it is sexually dimorphic. The male is crimson on the head, , and underparts, with a black throat and grey chest; the rest of his are cinnamon-coloured. The female is similarly patterned, but cinnamon-brown where the male is scarlet. The species was first described for science by Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1888, who named it for British explorer and collector John Whitehead. There are no subspecies.
It is primarily an insectivore, but also eats various plant materials, including fruits and seeds. Other than the timing of its breeding—typically between April and June—little is known about its breeding biology. The International Union for Conservation of Nature rates Whitehead's trogon as a near-threatened species. While its population numbers have not been quantified, the trogon is thought to be declining. Habitat loss is a key threat.
Taxonomy and etymology
English ornithologist Richard Bowdler Sharpe first described Whitehead's trogon for science in 1888, using a specimen collected on Mount Kinabalu, in the Malaysian state of Sabah. He gave it the scientific name Harpactes whiteheadi, assigning it to the genus containing other Asian trogons. There are no subspecies. Molecular studies indicate that it is most closely related to the Philippine trogon.
The genus name Harpactes is a transcription of the Greek word harpaktes, meaning "robber". The species and common names honour the British explorer John Whitehead, who first collected the bird.
Description
Like most trogons, Whitehead's trogon is sexually dimorphic; the male is considerably more colourful than the female. It ranks among Borneo's largest trogons, measuring in length. The male is crimson on the forehead, crown, nape, and sides of the head, with bare blue skin around the eyes. The rest of his upperparts are cinnamon-brown. His throat is black, shading into a grey breast, but the rest of his underparts are crimson. His wings are primarily black, with fine white barring on the and . His tail is mostly white underneath; above, the two central tail feathers are cinnamon with a broad black tip, and the remaining tail feathers are primarily black. The outermost tail feathers are white on the terminal half and along the outer web. He has a blue beak, pinkish-brown legs and feet, and reddish-brown irises. The female is similarly patterned, but duller, with cinnamon-brown replacing the crimson of the male. The barring on her secondaries and wing coverts is cinnamon-brown rather than white. The immature female is similar to the adult female, but her entire ventral side is uniformly coloured, lacking the adult's black throat and grey upper breast. She also has less blue colouring on her beak.
Voice
Whitehead's trogon vocalises only rarely. Its song is a loud series of four to five harsh, slow notes, evenly pitched and variously transcribed as "kwau kwau kwau kwau", "wark wark wark wark", or "poop poop". It also has a rolling "burr" call, which is sometimes followed by a loud, descending "kekekeke".
Distribution and habitat
Whitehead's trogon is endemic to the island of Borneo, where it occurs in mountainous areas between in elevation. Restricted to primary forest, it favours damp valleys. It is an uncommon and poorly-known species.
Behaviour
A shy and unobtrusive bird, Whitehead's trogon is easy to overlook as it sits quietly in the upper storey of dense forest. It is where it occurs. It associates loosely with mixed species flocks containing chestnut-hooded and Sunda laughingthrushes, Whitehead's broadbills and Sunda cuckooshrikes.
Feeding
Like all trogons, Whitehead's trogon feeds primarily on insects, which it captures in sallying flight from a perch, or gleans from foliage. Most of this prey is fairly large, including grasshoppers, locusts, stick insects, and leaf insects; however, insects as small as ants are taken. It also eats fruit, seeds and other plant material. Though it generally perches just under the canopy, it typically hunts in the understorey. In the mixed flocks it accompanies, it usually hunts at lower levels than the other species do. Individuals have been found with stones in their stomachs.
Breeding
Very little is known about the Whitehead trogon's breeding ecology. Birds have been found in breeding condition in late March and October; the latter date suggests the possibility of multiple broods or geographical variation in the breeding period. Nesting is known to occur in April, young birds have been collected in June, and family groups have been seen together in July. However, the nest and eggs remain undescribed, and details of its breeding biology—incubation and nesting periods, size of clutch, length of time to fledging, division of nestling care, and so forth—are not known.
Conservation
The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated Whitehead's trogon as a near-threatened species. Although its population has not been quantified, it is thought to be decreasing. Habitat loss, both through logging and conversion to agricultural use, is occurring at lower elevations on some of the mountains where it lives.

Bukit Jelutong (est. pop. 44,000) is an upscale suburb of Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia. The suburb is a planned community, with an area of over and developed by Guthrie Property Holding Berhad (GPHB), a subsidiary company of Sime Darby. Due to the suburb's upscale status, the residential units in Bukit Jelutong are mostly low-density bungalows and duplex houses, as well as some terraced houses. Bukit Jelutong has many parks and open grass areas.
History
Bukit Jelutong is located on a former oil palm plantation, the Bukit Jelutong Estate, which was owned by Kumpulan Guthrie Berhad. The development of Bukit Jelutong began in 1996, with the construction of the Guthrie Pavilion building, the present headquarters of GPHB. Since then, Bukit Jelutong has emerged as a much sought-after address in Shah Alam, with consistently well-received sales launches and price levels of real estate approaching those in more established areas in the Klang Valley, e.g. Petaling Jaya and Subang Jaya. In July 2005, the Guthrie Corridor Expressway connecting Bukit Jelutong to Rawang opened.
Infrastructure and amenities
Transportation
Bukit Jelutong is well-served by an excellent road network. The suburb is linked to Kuala Lumpur, Petaling Jaya, Shah Alam, Klang and other population centers in the Klang Valley by the North Klang Valley Expressway (NKVE), the Guthrie Corridor Expressway (GCE), the Federal Highway and the North–South Expressway Central Link (ELITE). The expressways also link Bukit Jelutong to the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport, Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) and Port Klang.
Closest railway stations are KTM Shah Alam and KTM Batu Tiga.
Commercial
Bukit Jelutong has a small commercial center where sundry businesses are located. GPHB had intentionally avoided developing large-scale commercial areas to avoid traffic congestion and noise to maintain the suburb's atmosphere of serenity and exclusivity. Nonetheless, Bukit Jelutong has close proximity to the Tesco and Giant stores, which are located just outside the suburb next to the GCE.
Industrial
The Bukit Jelutong Industrial Park is located in the eastern outskirts of Bukit Jelutong. It is a low-density industrial park hosting low-pollution, hi-tech industries as well as logistics warehousing and service facilities. The tenants are mostly multinational corporations from various industries, such as Xixili, Scania, ThyssenKrupp and Schenker AG.
Recreation and leisure
Besides the abundance of parks, Bukit Jelutong is also notable for its proximity to several golf courses and country clubs. These include the Kelab Golf Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah, the Glenmarie Golf & Country Club, the Monterez Golf & Country Club, and the Saujana Golf & Country Club. The Shah Alam Stadium is also only a 5-minute drive away from Bukit Jelutong.
Community
Community Participation
The Bukit Jelutong community has proven to be a close community judging from its regular events. The main yearly event is the Bukit Jelutong Carnival held annually. The Carnival is organised by the Bukit Jelutong Residents Association. Currently, most of the areas in Bukit Jelutong are gated and guarded through supports from the community itself.
Bukit Jelutong Residents Association
Registered in 2002, Bukit Jelutong Residents Association is very active. Regular events benefiting the residents are held regularly. Driven entirely by volunteers who are residents of Bukit Jelutong, the association is known for its close rapport with the local authorities.

Treasury Islands () are a small group of islands a few kilometres to the south of Bougainville and from the Shortland Islands. They form part of the Western Province of the country of the Solomon Islands. The two largest islands in the Treasuries are Mono Island and the smaller Stirling Island. The deep water strait between these two islands is called Blanche Harbor.
History
Early history
These islands were first discovered in 1788 by British Royal Navy officer Lieutenant John Shortland. In 1886, the islands were included in German New Guinea save for Mono Island, which the Britain claimed as its naval coaling base. In 1899, the islands were included in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate to be administered as part of Western District.
World War II
During World War II the islands were held by the Japanese until 25–27 October 1943, when the islands were invaded via amphibious assault by units of the New Zealand 8th Brigade. Following the invasion, an airstrip was built on the flatter Stirling Island by the USN 87th Construction battalion. This airfield was then used to support a campaign to neutralize Japanese air power at Rabaul. Stirling airfield is still in use today by Solomon Airlines.

The Florida red-bellied cooter or Florida redbelly turtle (Pseudemys nelsoni) is a species of turtle in the family Emydidae.
Etymology
The specific name, nelsoni, is in honor of American biologist George Nelson (born 1873).
Geographic range
P. nelsoni is endemic to Florida, and southern Georgia. Fossils of P. nelsoni have also been found along the coast of South Carolina from the Pleistocene Epoch, indicating that the historic range of this species used to extend further north. Today, its northern counterpart, the Northern Red-bellied Cooter (Psuedemys rubriventris) occupies this region.
Biology
The Florida redbelly cooter is mainly herbivorous, and can be found in nearly any type of aquatic habitat. It feeds on a variety of aquatic plants including waterweed (Vallisneria and Elodea), duckweed (Lemna and Wolffia), and arrowhead (Sagittaria) species. It reaches particularly high densities in spring runs, and occasionally can be found in brackish water. It appears to have an intermediate salinity tolerance compared to true freshwater forms and the highly specialized terrapin (Malachemys). This species is active year-round and spends a large portion of the day basking on logs. They are noted for sometimes laying their eggs in the nest mounds of alligators. Sex is temperature-dependent with males being born at cooler temperatures and females being born at warmer temperatures with a pivotal temperature of about 28.5 °C. The Florida redbelly is closely related to the Peninsula cooter (Pseudemys floridana) and can often be found basking on logs together.
Description
The Florida redbelly can be distinguished from other similar turtles by its distinctive red-tinged plastron (belly) and two cusps (like teeth) on its upper beak. Like most Pseudemys turtles, this species is a fairly large river turtle. Carapace length in mature turtles can range from . Females, which average in carapace length and weigh , are noticeably larger than males, which are around and in mass.
Export
Florida redbellies are commonly exported for consumption and the pet trade, with about 50% wild caught individuals and 50% captive bred.
Most of US export statistics (as collected by the World Chelonian Trust in 2002–2005) simply describe exported turtles by the genus, Pseudemys, without identifying the species. They are exported by the million, and are mostly farm-raised.

Zayn al-Dīn Abū Jaʿfar Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī ibn Shahrāshūb ibn Abī Naṣr ibn Abī al-Jaysh, more commonly known simply as Ibn Shahrāshūb, died 1192, was a literate Shia commentator, traditionist and jurist. He was an early eminent scholar amongst the shia community in the investigation of hadith and also Quranic sciences.
Life
He was born in 1095. His complete name was Abu Jafar Muhammad Ibn Ali Ibn Shahr Ashub. It seems that he originally was from Sari, Iran city of Mazandaran province. Due to lack of prominent sources, his birthplace remains uuncertain. It is well-documented that he memorized the whole Quran.
Scientific journey
Given that Ibn Shahr Ashoub was a traditionist, he traveled to many cities and countries, listening to and collecting Hadith. First he traveled to Baghdad during Al-Muqtafi as Abbasid Caliphate, then to Mosul and after to Aleppo. He also traveled to Khorasan before going to Baghdad. Also, he was for a while in Neishabour, sabzevar and kharazm. Also it is said that he visited some cities such as Isfahan, Ray, Kashan and Hamadan. Apparently when he was in Aleppo, both Ibn Batriq and Ibn Idris had listened to him. Ibn Shahr Asoub migrated and also died in Aleppo.
Teachers
According to pakatchi, Ibn Shahr Asoub had many popular masters in hadith such as follow:
Ahmad Ghazali
Ja Allah zamakhshari
Abu Ali Tabarsi
Abul Hasan Beihaqi farid Khorasan
Khatib-e- khawrazm
Qotb Addin Ravandi
Works
He left many books but some of them have been published. He wrote Manaqib Of Ale Abi Talib in praise of the virtues of Imam Ali. Some sermon also narrated by him for the first time. The most important books by him could be listed as below:
Manaqib Of Ale Abi Talib
Ma'alim Al Quran
Motashabih al Quran va Mokhtalifih
Theological beliefs
At the same time some other scholars believe that Ibn Shahr Ashoub not only believe in Imam's knowledge to Qhayb but he refers to it by reports from Imam Ali including possessing knowledge of Unseen and prophesy future events such as times of death of various people. On the other hand, some scholars think that he believed that both Imams and prophets couldn't have any knowledge of the Ghayb (absence) and that of past and future. Ibn Shahr Asoub denied these kinds of knowledge for imams and prophets. He believed, if this belief would be correct then we believe in parties for God. Instead he had believed that Imams and prophets just have knowledge of religion and law. he also referred to the point that Fatima has addressed by divine message.
Death
He died in 1192 when he had residence in Aleppo. He was buried near a place by the name of Jabal Al Joshan known as Mashahd al Hosein.

Reviews
Dave Brubeck's musical score for the film was heavily criticised as totally inappropriate for this style of mystery.
A timeout.com review stated "the film succeeds admirably in catching a feeling of repression and social conformity, and the idea of murder as a means of maintaining respectability rather than for gain or passion" and "a genuine '50s black thriller".

WRMX-LP, VHF analog channel 12, was an HSN-affiliated television station licensed to Nashville, Tennessee, United States.
History
WRMX first signed on January 14, 1988, by South Central Communications and was then a sister station to W24AE (now WJDE-CD), The station signed on two years after W24AE, and signed on under the callsign W12BV. Like W24AE, the station signed on carrying programming 24 hours a day, 7 days a week from Home Shopping Network, and broadcast in that format, until the station permanently went off the air on March 12, 2013. In between those times in 1995, the station changed its callsign to WRMX-LP. The callsign WRMX was taken from the then-sister radio station, which also held the call letters at that time on 96.3 FM, until it changed its callsign to WMAK in 2000. (That station is now known by the callsign of WCJK.)
The station permanently ceased operations March 12, 2013, HSN programming would continue to be carried on a digital subchannel of former sister station WJDE-LD4, until it was replaced by the then new upstart news network NewsNet (This network has since been replaced with Retro TV on that subchannel).

Abbazia di San Bartolomeo (Italian for Abbey of San Bartolomeo) is a Benedictine abbey in Carpineto della Nora, Province of Pescara (Abruzzo). It was declared a national monument in 1902.
From December 2014 the Italian Ministry of Culture manages the abbey through il Polo museale dell'Abruzzo, which became Direzione regionale Musei in December 2019.
History
The abby was built in 962 by the will of Berardo or Bernardo, count of Penne, on Pietrarossa mountain, located at the eastern slope of Mount Gran Sasso.
Important information about the foundation and the properties of the Benedictine abbey can be found in the chronicle written by the monk Alessandro, which tells the story of the monastery from its origins until 1193. From this text it is possible to draw most of the historical information relating to the Monastery. For example, in 1066 the founder's grandson, who ironically was also called Berardo or Bernardo, occupied the Abbey, its service buildings, its fields and completely destroyed the areas of the Monastery occupied by the Monks, forcing them to flee and leaving as the only religious guardian of the place his brother Sansone, who had previously made himself a monk; in the same year, however, the Normans led by Ugo Malmozzetto (one of the captains of Roberto di Loritello, in turn right arm of Roberto il Guiscardo) who had begun the conquest of coastal Abruzzo in 1061, dismissed Berardo from the County of Penne, taking his place, and freeing the Abbey of San Bartolomeo from its tyranny. In the Chronicon there is no mention of reconstructions, although the oldest parts of the building seem to date back to the 12th and 13th centuries, in addition to the restoration carried out in the 1970s by the Superintendency; the bell tower, for example, was finished in the course of the 11th century by Abbot Erimondo, who died in 1074.
The first abbot was Benedetto, chosen by Count Berardo, and under his regency the arm of San Bartolomeo reached the monastery, an event so exceptional that it attracted the bishops of Teate, Valva, Penne, Marsica and Apruzio to the abbey.

Richard ("Dick") Wurtman is a medical doctor who spent his career doing basic and translational neuroscience research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Early life and education
Richard Wurtman earned his undergraduate degree at University of Pennsylvania and then went to Harvard Medical School, where he earned his MD in 1960. He did a two year residency at Massachusetts General Hospital, and then joined Julius Axelrod's lab at the National Institutes of Health, which was pioneering studies of neurotransmitters and the ways that drugs affect them.
Career
In 1967 Massachusetts Institute of Technology invited him to open a lab to continue the NIH work in the Department of Nutrition and Food Science, which was the only department doing in vivo work at the time. In the 1980s MIT formed a new department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, which pulled together people working on psychology, neuroscience, and neuroscience, and Wurtman joined it.
In 1994 he was appointed as the first Cecil H. Green Distinguished Professor at MIT, and by that time was also a Professor of Neuroscience in MIT's Department of Brain & Cognitive Sciences, and a Professor of Neuropharmacology in the Harvard–MIT Division of Health Sciences & Technology.
He retired in 2011, and by that time he had published around 1,000 papers and trained around 300 students and post-docs.
Notable findings
Much of Wurtman's work at MIT involved discovering a new function of an existing biomolecule, like a hormone or neurotransmitter, figuring out how that discovery might be useful in medicine, and then trying to use that biomolecule as a drug itself, or using an existing drug to affect its function, a strategy called drug repurposing. His early affiliation with people in nutrition and food science also led him to consider ways that food and nutrient affect health.
He was involved in the evaluations of aspartame when it was first being introduced as an artificial sweetener; he initially testified on behalf of its manufacturer that it was safe, but subsequent research led him to call, in 1983, for further testing due to his concerns that consuming large amounts (not small amounts) could be harmful.
In 1994 his lab published work showing that melatonin is a hormone, secreted at night-time, needed for the induction & maintenance of normal sleep.
Along with Nicholas Zervas of Beth Israel Hospital and Harvard Medical School, another early area of Wurtman's research pertained to the neurotransmitter dopamine, and its role in stroke physiology. Wurtman's studies occurred at a time of significant growth in research and understanding of neurotransmitters, with optimistic expectations for practical outcomes.
In the 2000s his lab starting exploring food components that could help maintain or improve the health of the brain, focusing on choline, uridine, and the omega-3 fatty acid DHA; this work became incorporated into the medical food product, Souvenaid.
Serotoninergic synapses are thus a useful target for drugs to treat obesity and other conditions which affect appetite and mood (e.g. premenstrual syndrome; seasonal depression). The patent for using fluoxetine to treat premenstrual dysphoric disorder was licensed to Wurtman's startup, Interneuron, which in turn sold them to Lilly. This became the product marketed as Sarafem.
Commercial activities
Wurtman co-founded Interneuron Pharmaceuticals in 1988, which was renamed to Indevus in 2002. Indevus brought an in-licensed product, Trospium chloride, to market before being acquired by Endo Pharmaceuticals in 2009 for $370 million in cash and $267 million in milestones.
Wurtman's patent on using dexfenfluramine, an isomer of fenfluramine, to suppress appetite was also licensed to Interneuron, which licensed the patents to Wyeth; this drug was withdrawn from the market in 1997 after "Phen-fen" was found to be harmful.
He also founded Back Bay Scientific, Inc. along with his wife and daughter; the company sells dietary supplements.
Publications

Mawlawi Mehdi Mujahid (; 1988 – 17 August 2022) was a rebel of Hazara ethnic background from Afghanistan who led around 200 Hazara fighters during the Balkhab uprising. He was a Taliban commander before rebelling against the Taliban. He was killed on 17 August 2022.
Early life
Mehdi was born in a small village called Hosh in the Balkhab District of northern Afghanistan to a religious Shia family belonging to the Hazara ethnic group. His father, Morad Mujahid, was a member of Hezbe Wahdat and he fought in the Soviet–Afghan War, which was when Morad began using "Mujahid" as a surname. Mehdi was 8 years old when the Taliban first gained control of Afghanistan in 1996. Three years later, the Taliban captured his home district of Balkhab. He fled with his family to neighboring Iran, returning to Afghanistan after the December 2001 Afghan Interim Administration had been formed.
Mehdi began attending school and seemed motivated to take over the family farm. But in his early twenties, a Hazara warlord had seized their ancestral lands. In retaliation, Mehdi and friends kidnapped the warlord's son and held him hostage, only returning him after the warlord returned the lands. That night, the warlord's forces surrounded Mehdi's home, and clashes erupted as he tried to escape. Mehdi was hospitalized and then jailed for seven years for kidnapping.
He became more religious and first came in contact with the Taliban while in prison, however, he remained a Shia and did not convert to Sunni Islam.
Taliban career
In April 2020, the Taliban appointed Mehdi as the head of intelligence in Bamyan Province, and the chief of the Taliban in Sar-e Pol Province, a move which many Taliban members and the Haqqani network were opposed to for many reasons, mainly due to him being a Hazara Shia. The Taliban were accused of using Mehdi to increase their influence among Hazaras and other Shia Muslims. Mehdi was later fired from the Taliban's head of intelligence position in Bamyan after making a speech against the closure of girls' schools, and his persistent demanding of equality for Hazaras and other Shia Muslims. After being fired from his position, he left the Taliban and declared war against them.
Anti-Taliban career
In 2022, Mehdi announced that he was arming fighters loyal to him which consisted of about 200 Hazara Shias. He also built a monument dedicated to himself and Abdul Ali Mazari in Balkhab, and he also turned more to his Shia Islamist and Hazara nationalist views. His forces ousted the Taliban's district governor and captured the Balkhab district. Mawlawi Ataullah, the Taliban's district governor, fled Balkhab, and Mehdi replaced him with one of his Hazara associates.
Mehdi Mujahid was supported by the NRF and Hazara politicians Muhammad Mohaqiq of HWIMA and Karim Khalili of Hezbe Wahdat, which Mehdi's father was a member of.
On 13 June 2022, Mehdi Mujahid gained full control of Balkhab district and his fighters were inflicting heavy damage on the Taliban. He was initially winning the conflict although the Taliban later outnumbered his fighters and retook Balkhab.
Assassination attempt
On the morning of 25 June 2022, in the midst of the fighting between the Taliban and Mehdi's forces, Mehdi's house in the Hosh village of Balkhab district was targeted by Taliban airstrikes. Mehdi and his family survived, and none of them were injured. However, that same night, the Taliban killed Mohammad Moradi, his wife, and his daughter in Ghor Province. Moradi was a popular anti-Taliban commander. His support for Mehdi Mujahid was seen by the Hasht-e Subh as the reason for the Taliban attack on his house.
Death
Mehdi Mujahid was killed on 17 August 2022 while he was trying to escape to Iran. It is unclear how he was killed. According to the locals and some Afghan media outlets, Mujahid was caught by the Taliban in the village of Bunyad in Kohsan District where he was arrested and had his identity confirmed before being executed. Two pictures also started circulating on social media which showed Mujahid alive and in the custody of the Taliban before being executed. One picture showed a shaved Mehdi Mujahid wearing a white turban, and another one of him without the turban and surrounded by unknown men, presumably Taliban members.
However, the Taliban's Ministry of Defense had denied local reports suggesting that Mujahid was executed. Taliban officials say that Mujahid was attempting to escape to Iran when their intelligence and border security caught him by the Afghanistan–Iran border and shot him dead. Naeemul Haq Haqqani, Taliban provincial information minister, told AFP that Mujahid was “killed after a conflict” and “rumors that he was captured alive are lies”.
Reaction
Haji Muhammad Mohaqiq, a prominent ethnic Hazara leader who had strongly supported Mehdi through his conflict with the Taliban, condemned the killing of Mehdi Mujahid. He said “It is worth mentioning that cold-bloodedly executing a person while he was not taken from war and was an unarmed traveler is against the religious teachings and is a war crime according to the international law.”

South Wales West () is an electoral region of the Senedd, consisting of seven constituencies. The region elects 11 members, seven directly elected constituency members and four additional members. The electoral region was first used in 1999, when the National Assembly for Wales was created.
Each constituency elects one Member of the Senedd by the first past the post electoral system, and the region as a whole elects four additional or top-up Members of the Senedd, to create a degree of proportional representation. The additional member seats are allocated from closed lists by the D'Hondt method, with constituency results being taken into account in the allocation.
County boundaries
The region covers the whole of the preserved county of West Glamorgan, part of the preserved county of Mid Glamorgan and part of the preserved county of South Glamorgan. The rest of Mid Glamorgan is divided between the South Wales Central and South Wales East electoral regions. The rest of South Glamorgan is within the South Wales Central region.
Electoral region profile
The region is predominantly urban, taking in Wales' second-largest city, Swansea, as well as working-class towns such as Neath and Port Talbot. However, there are also rural regions, such as on the Gower peninsula. A higher proportion of the local populace are Welsh speakers than in the neighbouring region, South Wales Central.

O'Banion's was a nightclub located at 661 N. Clark St. in Chicago's River North neighborhood. Named for Chicago Irish gangster Dion O'Banion, it was established in June 1978, inside what had formerly been McGovern's Saloon (itself an infamous Chicago gangster bar where a young O'Banion had performed as a signing waiter) as well as a series of strip clubs and gay bars. Chicago's first Punk club Le Mer Viper had burned down two months prior, and O'Banion's began to form the epicenter of the city's early Punk scene in what was then a notorious skid row area as well as hire many of the former employees of Le Mer Viper.
The club promoted shows by national-touring acts including Toxic Reasons, Hüsker Dü, The Replacements, and Dead Kennedys. Additionally, numerous bands from Chicago's own music scene began playing shows there before achieving wider success, including Naked Raygun, Strike Under, Ministry, and Skafish.
In 1979, the club began hosting newly popular new wave bands after a series of difficulties with their earlier clientele, but owner Rus Cramsie closed the venue in 1982 after encountering financial difficulties.
The building was eventually renovated into The Kerryman bar and restaurant as River North began to gentrify in the 1990s.

Edwin Henry Fitler (December 2, 1825 – May 31, 1896) was an American businessman and politician from Pennsylvania. He founded Edwin H. Fitler & Company, the largest cordage manufacturer in the United States at the time, and served as a Republican Presidential Elector for Pennsylvania in 1876 and Mayor of Philadelphia from 1887 to 1891.
Early life
Fitler was born in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on December 2, 1825, the son of Elizabeth Wonderly Fitler and William Fitler, who ran a successful leather tanning and manufacturing business.
He received his education in Philadelphia, and studied law with attorney Charles E. Lex, but decided on a business career and obtained a position in his brother-in-law's cordage manufacturing business, George J. Weaver & Company.
In 1850, Fitler married Josephine R. Baker.
Business career
Fitler became a partner in Weaver's business two years later, and it was renamed Weaver, Fitler & Company. Displaying an aptitude for mechanics, Fitler developed several inventions to improve and speed up rope making, which made the business more profitable.
Over time Fitler bought out the other partners in Weaver, Fitler & Company, and by 1870 the business was renamed again to Edwin H. Fitler & Company. He relocated the factory to the Bridgesburg neighborhood of Philadelphia where it covered more than 15 acres of land. His success continued, and his company eventually became the largest cordage manufacturer in the United States. Recognized as a leader in his industry, Fitler served as president of the American Cordage Manufacturers Association. He partnered with William Deering to conduct experiments to improve a twine binder being developed by Deering. Fitler was also active in other businesses, including member of the board of directors of the National Bank of the Northern Liberties.
Fitler also served as president of the board of trustees of the Thomas Jefferson Medical College, a member of the board of managers of the Edwin Forrest Home, and a member of the board of directors of the North Pennsylvania Railroad.
Civic activism
During the American Civil War, Fitler supported the Union. He was a director, vice president, and president of the Union League of Philadelphia, and his efforts included personally paying to recruit and equip a company from among the employees of his business.
Fitler was a leader in planning and organizing the 1876 Centennial Exposition. He was also one of the founders of the Philadelphia Art Club and a member of The Philadelphia Club
Political career
Fitler was a Republican and served as one of Pennsylvania's presidential electors in 1876.
In 1887 Fitler was elected Mayor of Philadelphia, and he served one term, 1887 to 1891.
Though he was not an active candidate, in 1888 Fitler was nominated for US president and received the votes of the Philadelphia delegation on the first ballot at that year's Republican national convention.
Death and legacy
Fitler died on May 31, 1896, at his estate in the Torresdale section of Philadelphia. His net worth was estimated to be $3 million. He was buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery.
Fitler Square, an elementary school in Philadelphia and Fitler Street, in Philadelphia's Torresdale neighborhood, are named in his honor.
A residence hall in The Quadrangle at the University of Pennsylvania, Fisher-Hassenfeld College House) bears his name.
He is the great-grandfather of Happy Rockefeller, second wife of Vice President Nelson Rockefeller.

The Tangut script (Tangut: ; ) was a logographic writing system, used for writing the extinct Tangut language of the Western Xia dynasty. According to the latest count, 5863 Tangut characters are known, excluding variants. The Tangut characters are similar in appearance to Chinese characters, with the same type of strokes, but the methods of forming characters in the Tangut writing system are significantly different from those of forming Chinese characters. As in Chinese calligraphy, regular, running, cursive and seal scripts were used in Tangut writing.
History
According to the History of Song (1346), the script was designed by the high-ranking official Yeli Renrong in 1036. The script was invented in a short period of time, and was put into use quickly. Government schools were founded to teach the script. Official documents were written in the script (with diplomatic ones written bilingually). A great number of Buddhist scriptures were translated from Tibetan and Chinese, and block printed in the script. Although the dynasty collapsed in 1227, the script continued to be used for another few centuries. The last known example of the script occurs on a pair of Tangut dharani pillars found at Baoding in present-day Hebei province, which were erected in 1502.
Structure
Tangut characters can be divided into two classes: simple and composite. The latter are much more numerous. The simple characters can be either semantic or phonetic. None of the Tangut characters are pictographic, while the Chinese characters were at the time of their creation; this is one of the major differences between Tangut and Chinese characters.
Most composite characters comprise two components. A few comprise three or four. A component can be a simple character, or part of a composite character. The composite characters include semantic-semantic ones and semantic-phonetic ones. A few special composite characters were made for transliterating Chinese and Sanskrit.
There are a number of pairs of special composite characters worth noting. The members of such a pair have the same components, only the location of the components in them is different (e.g. AB vs. BA, ABC vs. ACB). The members of such a pair have very similar meanings.
The Sea of Characters (Tangut: ; ), a 12th century monolingual Tangut rhyming dictionary, analyzes what other characters each character is derived from. Its analyses illustrate another difference between Tangut and Chinese characters. In Chinese, typically, each semantic component has its own meaning, and each phonetic component its own sound; they contribute this meaning or sound to any complex character they appear in. By contrast, in the Sea of Characters analysis of Tangut, a component contributes the meaning or sound of some other character that contains it, potentially a different one in every appearance. For example, the component can have the meaning of "bird" ( *dźjwow, of which it is the left side), as in *dze "wild goose" = *dźjwow "bird" + *dze "longevity". But the same component is also used to convey meanings of bone, smoke, food, and time, among others.
Some components take different shape depending on what part of the character they appear in (e.g., left side, right side, middle, bottom).
Reconstruction
Unicode
6,125 characters of the Tangut script were included in Unicode version 9.0 in June 2016 in the Tangut block. 755 Radicals and components used in the modern study of Tangut were added to the Tangut Components block. An iteration mark, , was included in the Ideographic Symbols and Punctuation block. Five additional characters were added in June 2018 with the release of Unicode version 11.0. Six additional characters were added in March 2019 with the release of Unicode version 12.0. A further nine Tangut ideographs were added to the Tangut Supplement block and 13 Tangut components were added to the Tangut Components block in March 2020 with the release of Unicode version 13.0. The Tangut Supplement block size was changed in Unicode version 14.0 to correct the erroneous block end point (version 13: → version 14.0: ).

High school career
Crowell attended George Washington Carver High School in Columbus, Georgia, where he played football and ran track. During his high school career, he rushed for 4,872 yards with 61 touchdowns on 429 carries for the Tigers football team. He was considered the best running back recruit by Scout.com and the fourth-best by Rivals.com.
In addition to football, Crowell was a standout track & field athlete. He lettered all four years competing as a sprinter and long-distance runner. He won the 100-meter dash event at the 2009 MCSD Meet, recording a career-best time of 10.91 seconds. He posted career-bests of 22.38 in the 200m, 52.53 in the 400m, and 12:36.84 in the 3200m.
College career
University of Georgia
2011 season
Starting running back Washaun Ealey's transferring to Jacksonville State in the spring led to a vacancy at that position for the 2011 season at the University of Georgia. Second string running back Caleb King was next in line to take over as the team's starting running back, but the senior was declared academically ineligible on July 8. The position was wide open during football practices in August and leading up to Georgia's opening game at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta against Boise State on September 3. He earned the starting running back job for the Bulldogs as a freshman for their September 17 game against Coastal Carolina. However, it was his fine performance against South Carolina on September 10 that created Crowell's chance to take over the starting role as tailback as the 6–0, 215-pound true freshman scored two touchdowns while rushing 16 times for 118 yards and catching two passes for 40 yards against the Gamecocks in a 45–42 heartbreaking loss to Coach Steve Spurrier's South Carolina Gamecocks. Against Coastal Carolina, Crowell had 16 rushes for 86 yards and highlighted his performance with a 27-yard touchdown run to open the game as Georgia went on to defeat the Chanticleers 59–0. In addition, he had a 12-yard reception in the contest.
After starting off 0–2, coach Mark Richt's Georgia Bulldogs went on a 10-game winning streak and a first-place ranking in the SEC East, which placed Georgia in the SEC Championship Game on December 3. Georgia had a 10–2 record as the AP College Football Poll ranked the Bulldogs No. 12 in the country.
During the season, Crowell had some breakout performances, such as his 30 carries, 147 yard-outing against Ole Miss on September 24 in Oxford, Mississippi as Georgia won 27–13. Crowell followed up the Ole Miss performance with 104 yards rushing against Mississippi State on October 1 as Georgia defeated the MSU Bulldogs, 24–10. He apparently had scored on a 49-yard touchdown run in the contest, but that play was cut short to only 14 yards after the line judge had determined that Crowell's shoe had just touched the sideline — it appeared to be very close according to video replay. On October 8 at Knoxville, Tennessee, Crowell ran into a stout Tennessee defense as he scored two touchdowns but was contained to 19 rushes for 58 yards and two receptions for five yards. Georgia defeated Tennessee 20–12.
Later in the season on October 29, Crowell helped Georgia win a narrow victory against SEC East rival Florida 24–20 as the true freshman ran with the football 18 times for 81 yards. Crowell had another breakout performance – this one against Auburn as he rushed 24 times for 132 yards and a touchdown on November 12 as Georgia won convincingly by a score of 45–7. He also caught a pass for one yard against the Tigers.
An injury slowed Crowell down near the end of the regular season as he suffered a high ankle sprain on November 19 against Kentucky as the running back finished with two rushes for 11 yards. Georgia defeated the Wildcats 19–10. The injury caused Crowell to miss the regular-season finale against in-state rival Georgia Tech on November 26.
Georgia played nationally ranked #1 LSU (12–0) in the SEC Championship Game on December 3 as Crowell and the Bulldogs would go on to take a lead and go into the locker room at halftime up 10–7. He struggled to get on track against the tough Tiger defense as Crowell finished with 10 rushes for 15 yards and a catch for negative three yards. LSU, led by defensive back-punt returner Tyrann Mathieu, exploded in the second half as the Tigers won the contest, 42–10.
Crowell finished the season with 185 carries for 850 rushing yards and five touchdowns. He also had eight receptions for 59 yards and a touchdown in 12 games. On December 5, Crowell was named freshman of the year by The Associated Press. The Georgia Bulldogs were invited to play #12 Michigan State (10–3) in the Outback Bowl in Tampa, Florida on January 2. Georgia lost the game in the third overtime 33–30 and fell to a 10–4 record.
On June 29, 2012, Crowell was arrested on possession of a weapon in a school zone, possession of a firearm with an altered identification, and carrying a concealed firearm. Crowell was dismissed from the University of Georgia football team due to his arrest and his constant disciplinary problems—including failing a drug test.
Alabama State
2012 season
Crowell enrolled at Alabama State in July 2012.
During the 2012 season, Crowell ran the ball well, having several good games for Alabama State, including the breakout performance he displayed on September 29 by rushing for 127 yards, which included a 61-yard touchdown run in a 54–14 win against Alcorn State. He finished the 2012 season as the Hornets' leading rusher while helping Alabama State to a 7–4 record.

2015 season
In the 2015 season, Crowell and Duke Johnson combined for a majority of the backfield carries for the Browns. In Week 4, Crowell ran for 63 yards on 12 carries against the San Diego Chargers, including a 32-yard run. Crowell recorded a career-high 62 receiving yards, including a career-long 53-yard catch. Crowell recorded 125 total yards and running back Duke Johnson recorded 116 total yards as well, this marked the first time the Browns had two running backs each record more than 100 total yards in the same game since 2004 (Lee Suggs with 119 yards and William Green with 115). In Week 5, Crowell scored his first touchdown reception of his career against the Baltimore Ravens.

He played in all 16 games of the season and was the starting running back in nine of those games.
2016 season
In the 2016 season, Crowell led the Browns in rushing attempts, rushing yards, and rushing touchdowns. In Week 2, versus the Baltimore Ravens, Crowell recorded a career-long 85-yard touchdown run. The run was the second-longest rushing play in franchise history, behind Bobby Mitchell's 90-yard run in 1959. He finished the game with 133 yards on 18 carries and a touchdown, averaging 7.4 yards per carry. In Week 4, Crowell ran for 112 yards on 16 carries and a touchdown against the Washington Redskins. Crowell's 386 yards were the most by a Brown through the first four games of a season since Jim Brown recorded 476 yards in 1965. In Week 14, against the Cincinnati Bengals, he had 113 rushing yards in the 23–10 loss. To close out the regular season, he had a season-high 152 rushing yards in a 27–24 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Crowell finished the 2016 season with a career-high 952 rushing yards and 319 receiving yards. His 4.8 yards per carry ranked fifteenth among NFL running backs in the 2016 season.
2017 season
On February 28, 2017, the Browns placed a second-round tender on Crowell, keeping him in Cleveland through 2017. Crowell got a majority of the backfield carries in 2017.
In Week 8, against the Minnesota Vikings, Crowell had 118 scrimmage yards in the 33–16 loss. In Week 14 in an overtime loss to the Green Bay Packers, he finished with a season-high 121 rushing yards. Overall, in the 2017 season, he finished with 853 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, 28 receptions, and 182 receiving yards as the Browns recorded the second 0–16 season in NFL history.
New York Jets
On March 14, 2018, Crowell signed a three-year deal worth $12 million with the New York Jets.
During Monday Night Football against the Detroit Lions in Week 1, Crowell finished with 102 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns, of which one was a 62-yard run, as the Jets won 48–17. Crowell returned to Cleveland for a Thursday Night Football contest in Week 3. He had 16 carries for 34 yards and two rushing touchdowns in the loss to the Cleveland Browns. After running for one of his touchdowns, he used the football to simulate cleaning himself after defecation, then threw the ball into the stands, drawing an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. With NFL Network carrying the game nationally and Joe Buck on the call, the gesture drew comparisons to when Randy Moss pretended to moon Green Bay Packers fans at Lambeau Field during an NFC Divisional Playoff game in early 2005. Buck had called Moss' act "disgusting" on air, but was more reserved for Crowell's celebration. During Week 5 against the Denver Broncos, Crowell finished with 219 rushing yards, including a 77-yard touchdown run as the Jets won 34–16. His 219 rushing yards set a new Jets franchise record. Crowell was awarded AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for his performance. He was placed on injured reserve on December 14, 2018 with a toe injury he suffered against the Buffalo Bills. He finished the 2018 season with 143 carries for 685 rushing yards and six rushing touchdowns along with 21 receptions for 152 yards.
On March 14, 2019, Crowell was released by the Jets, after they signed Le'Veon Bell in free agency.
Oakland Raiders
On March 28, 2019, Crowell signed a one-year contract with the Oakland Raiders. On April 29, he suffered a severed Achilles during a team workout. He was placed on injured reserve on May 3, 2019, ending his season and career.
NFL career statistics
Controversy
In July 2016, following the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, Crowell posted on his Instagram a controversial violent image of a faceless person dressed in black who was slitting the throat of a captive law enforcement officer with a knife; he later had the photo deleted and apologized for his actions.

Synopsis
Jennet is a young English girl whose witch hunter father is frequently away on witch hunts. She's left with her aunt Isobel, a fan of Isaac Newton's scientific style. The two become close, but eventually Isobel's viewpoints cause her to become the focus of a witch-hunt that ends with her getting burned at the stake.

Critical reception for The Last Witchfinder has been positive, and Publishers Weekly gave the book a favorable starred review. The Washington Post and The New York Times praised the work, and the Washington Post commented that the work was "so enchanting that when I finished the novel, I sat for a moment wondering when I could visit Jennet's grave in Philadelphia." USA Today wrote that they enjoyed the work's main character and that "Morrow injects humor and detail, but to enjoy this novel, you need a real appetite for the history of science." The Independent was more mixed in their review, as they felt that "if only this had been edited down to about half its length, it could have been a cracking picaresque yarn."

Ghost 1.0 is a Metroidvania video game developed and published by Francisco "franfistro" Téllez de Meneses, the developer of Unepic, in collaboration with an unnamed development team. It was released on June 7, 2016 for the digital distribution platform Steam and later for GOG. It has also been released on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Wii U, and Xbox One.
The game received mostly positive reviews, that praised the game's visual style, story and action.
Gameplay
The player starts as a gynoid known as the Chassis, which is being remote-controlled by a female, humanoid life-form known as Ghost. Ghost has the ability to use the Chassis as her physical body, and engage in combat by shooting enemies and using other weapons and techniques. She can also abandon the Chassis, leaving it defenseless and traveling the world as a virtual "ghost" to hack into other robots and take them over. This can be used to find secrets or to destroy other robots that would otherwise be dangerous. If the Chassis is destroyed, it is automatically replicated by super-fast 3D printer.
In typical Metroidvania fashion, the player is expected to explore the game world and collect various access cards and other items that will unlock the next area of the game. At certain points at the end of a level, the player must fight bosses to proceed. Certain rooms contain alarms that must be triggered, causing a gauntlet of enemies that can be fought repeatedly for more money (in the form of energy).
The player can unlock skills through the use of a skill tree. The player gains skill points based on how many access codes they have obtained, rather than by leveling up in the traditional sense by defeating enemies. However, the player can upgrade weapons in a more traditional manner.
The game also contains puzzle sections in the form of a laser-dodging minigame, where the player must possess one or more robots to make it past a laser grid that will destroy the robots on contact. An infiltration and rescue mission involving this towards the game's end can be skipped if the player so chooses.
Plot
The game takes place in the future, and revolves around two intelligent but socially awkward cybercriminals, the roboticist Boogan (Jonathan Jones) and the hacker Jacker (Andrew Miller). The two of them desire to infiltrate the space station owned by the Nakamura Corporation, which is the world's largest and wealthiest producer of androids. They believe that Nakamura holds the source code for their highly intelligent androids, or "Nakas", within the station, since all the androids are controlled from a single server room. They find a contact named Viktor (Steven Kelly) who claims to have a number of freelance spies who work for him, and they hire one named "Ghost" (Mirisha Lottich) from him to sneak into the station via space elevator.
They tell Ghost to do whatever is necessary to capture the artificial intelligence code, believing they can sell it to the highest bidder and become rich. However, as Ghost shuts down various parts of the station, her behavior starts to become unusual. Boogan and Jacker begin to suspect that Ghost is actually a sentient AI that resides on the same server as the Nakas. They also discover that Nakamura is synthesizing organic compounds aboard the station for some reason.
To test their theory of Ghost being an AI, they cause a massive power fluctuation, which also causes Ghost to lose her connection. This proves them right, meanwhile, Viktor is angered that Boogan and Jacker are sabotaging his agents and sends a real human agent to destroy Ghost's chassis. Ghost narrowly escapes from Viktor's agent, but Viktor decides to target Jacker instead, kidnapping him and putting him deep underground to blackmail Boogan to stop.
Ghost leaves the station and goes with Boogan to rescue Jacker, successfully infiltrating the highly secured underground compound. She then returns to the station and accesses the server room. There, she realizes that all the "servers" were in fact human brains being fed nutrients by the station. Viktor attempts to kill her by destroying her disembodied brain, but one of the station's scientists saves her by putting her brain onto a robot with a force field. Ghost is then able to fight off waves of defense robots while Jacker defeats Viktor's hired hacker and manages to hide Ghost's brain forever by scrambling the entire database of the brains' serial numbers.
At the end of the story, it is revealed that Nakamura purchased a bankrupt cryonics company that had stored thousands of brains, revived them using technology they invented, and erased their memories to profit from using them to control robotic avatars through a brain-computer interface. Viktor was in on the plan and purchased some of the brains to use as powerful agents. All the Nakas are set free and given human rights, recognizing their status as cyborgs, while the CEO of Nakamura (Alex Jenks) is arrested. Ghost decides to join Boogan and Jacker as a permanent member of their team, much to their shock.
Prequel
A retro-styled prequel to the game, entitled Mini Ghost, was released on April 28, 2017 for Windows. It features graphics styled after those of the MSX, and also includes a multiplayer mode.
Reception
Ghost 1.0 was reviewed positively, with an aggregate score of 80/100 on Metacritic for the PC version of the game.
Ramon Nafria of Vandal Online rated the game 9/10, calling it "one of the best Metroidvanias we've played in the last few years".
David Jagneaux of Nintendo Life rated the game's Switch version 7/10, praising the gameplay mechanics as "subtle and clever". He also praised the game's world design as making internal sense and called the game's soundtrack "rocking". However, he criticized the game's story as "forgettable" with "cheesy", "cringe-inducing" humor.

The Bettani (), also spelled Baittani or Bhittani, is a Pashtun tribe located mostly in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Bettani are named after Shaykh Beṭ, their legendary ancestor who is said to be the second son of Qais Abdur Rashid. The Bettani's are Sunni Muslims of Hanafi sect. The Bettani confederacy includes the tribes of Bettanis, and Matti tribes progeny of BiBi Mattu daughter of Sheikh Bettan. These include Lodi also known as Lohani, as well as the tribes of Marwat, and Niazi while Shirani has also been mentioned as part of Bettanis.
History
According to Makhzan-e-Afghani the Bettani are said to be named after their ancestor Betṭ Baba (claimed by a legend to be the first Pashto poet), who lived in the Altamur range which is located between Logar and Zurmat and he was buried in Ghazni according to the legend.
Bhittani's of Quetta Balochistan:- according to Captain J.A Robinson "Notes on Nomad Tribes of Eastern Afghanistan" published in 1934, out of 100 families of Powinda/Nomad Bhittani's, there were three villages of Bhittani's in Karabagh and Ghazni and about out of 100 families, 30 families merged with "Mian Khel" and 70 families scattered among the "Nasar" tribes. The means of livelihood of these Bhittani's were the same as that of the tribes with which they live. Some of these families of katagran clan of nomad Bhittani's migrated towards Quetta in the 1880s and started their abode with Kamal khails, Naimat Khels and Yahya Khel clans of nomad Nasar tribes.
The Betani are known to have lived in the Logar, Zurmat and Ghazni area until the 15th century, but then they came into conflict with the Ghilji and the Bettanis were expelled from the area towards the east. Some lineages succeeded to take control of Gabarḡar, which is located between the Bannu Basin and Dēra, while other Bettani lineages migrated further northeastwards.
Settlements
Bettani reside in Pakistan in Tank and Lakki Marwat, a territory that is a buffer zone separating Tank and Lakki Marwat districts from the Mahsud tribe of central Waziristan in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Jandola is considered the capital of the Bettani tribes.

The Dhana tribe is divided into Ali khail, Bobi, Waroki and Dadi Khel subclans. The Wraspoon subdivides into Mazyani, Tari, Chapli and Shakhi. The Betani have always been few in numbers: From 8–9,000 in about 1884 they are said to have increased to more than 43,000 by about 1960. The current numbers of Bettani tribe around 200,000 and 250,000 individuals.

Politics
Bettani tribe culture is different from other Pashtuns.
In minor matters, disputes are common and sometimes ongoing for decades. On different occasions, they also cooperate, and their internal matters are decided in three Bettani jirga (tribal councils/(dary bettanay) based upon the three subclans of Tattha, Wraspoon and Dhana. The rival families give complete authority to the three Bettani councils, and the council's decisions are generally obeyed, but in cases of opposition to these decisions, a family may be fined. If the dispute is of bigger nature between the tribes then the DCO, MNA and Senators, elders, sometimes from neighbouring Districts also participate in the jirga to resolve the disputes. The people have to accept the decision made by the jirga. The jirga results are presented to the DCO for information and record. If any one of the parties is not happy or satisfied with the decision made by the jirga then the grieved party can go to the appellate court and then the Home Department. Traditionally the household head has a stronghold and decision-making power for the whole family. The wives are traditionally submissive to their husbands and the likelihood of divorce or separation in the tribal society is negligible. The Bhittani are the hereditary enemies of the Mahsuds, however, over the centuries they have joined them during important battles against invaders. In August 2007, Bhittani tribesmen threatened a Lashkar against Mahsud tribesmen if they did not return 16 kidnapped Bhittanis. Mahsud raiders had to pass through Bhittani territory to enter the nearby areas so the Mehsud tribe always avoid any kind of clash with the Bhittani tribe.

Especially tomato is the main crop cultivated in different areas including Ummar Adda, Maghzai, Tank Zam area and Tank. Many of the men of this tribe serve in the Frontier Constabulary and Frontier Corps. Many people of this tribe work as PTC and CT teachers in the education department in the respective districts. Nowadays scores of Bettani tribesmen are engaged in business, trade, commerce, Government and private sector and other respectable professions like the medical field. The tribesmen are serving the country with a spirit of devotion and dedication.

Several government Primary and few high schools and one Government College for Boys is imparting education to the students in District Tank. However, there is dire need to establish more primary and high schools particularly for female students. According to Malik Bahik Khan, (a resident of Sobati Katch District Tank) nearly 90 per cent youth of the tribe have basic education. But to poverty several people only have access to high, secondary schools and colleges. It is a good sign that the educated youth are broad minded and talented. The people will appreciate government and non government organizations to come forward and establish more educational institutions, technical and vocational centers in the areas.
