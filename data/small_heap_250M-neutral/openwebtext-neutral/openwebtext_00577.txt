German engineering and electronics conglomerate giant Siemens AG has announced it is to cut its workforce by 15,000 (4% of total) as part of its strategy to reduce costs.
Siemens and its subsidiaries have about 360,000 employees in nearly 190 countries.
Approximately ten thousand jobs will be cut around the world, and 5,000 in Germany. According to Bloomberg, the company had initially considered cutting 8,000 jobs in Germany.
Job cuts in Germany will occur at the industry division (2,000 jobs), energy sector (1,400 jobs), and infrastructure and cities unit (1,400 jobs). Two-hundred office workers will have to leave by the end of September next year.
In July this year, Peter Löscher, who had been Chief Executive Office (CEO) of Siemens since 2007, had a disagreement with the company's board of directors regarding profitability and was axed. They were replaced by Josef Käser, who had been Chief Financial Officer for seven years.
Siemens said it would fail in its profit margin target
On July 25th, 2013, Löscher announced that the company would not meet its goal of profits making up 12% of sales next year. Siemens has been involved in a € 6.3 billion ($8.5 billion) savings program – part of an effort to catch up with superior profitability among its main competitors, including General Electric Co. (USA) and ABB Ltd (Switzerland).
In 2012, General Electric's profit margin was 15%, ABB's 10.3%, while Siemens trailed at 9.5%.
Siemens says it has reached an agreement with trades unions regarding about half of the job cuts, “the other half will follow…” Many of the job cuts involve early retirement.
Siemens emphasized that nobody has yet been laid off. It added that it has no intention of making enforced redundancies, and hopes to rely on attrition and voluntary severance deals.
A Siemens spokesperson said the company announced its job-cutting plans because it wanted to end speculation in the market regarding how many jobs were to be cut.

Pope Francis has condemned as "homicidal madness" recent deadly "fundamentalist-inspired" attacks around the world.
In a speech to the Vatican diplomatic corps, the pontiff called on religious leaders to reaffirm that "one can never kill in God's name".
They also warned that poverty served as fertile ground for radicalisation.
Thousands of people died in jihadist attacks in Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East and the Americas in 2016.
"We are dealing with a homicidal madness which misuses God's name in order to disseminate death, in a play for domination and power," the 80-year-old Argentine pontiff said on Monday.
"Hence I appeal to all religious authorities to join in reaffirming unequivocally that one can never kill in God's name.
"Fundamentalist terrorism is the fruit of a profound spiritual poverty, and often is linked to significant social poverty," the Pope said. "It can only be fully defeated with the joint contribution of religious and political leaders."

In July, months after deadly assaults in France and Belgium, Pope Francis warned that jihadist attacks in Europe was proof that "the world is at war".
However, they stressed they did not mean a war of religions, but rather a conflict over "interests, money, resources".
In a wide-ranging speech on Monday, Pope Francis also said that:
So far, 2016 hasn't been a great year for meteor showers, but that could change with the Delta Aquarids this month and, especially, with the Perseids meteor shower in August.
The Quadrantid meteor shower peak in January was short-lived, and the Eta Aquarids got a decent showing, but the Lyrids — the meteors that often leave trails and can come in hard-to-predict surges that offer 100 meteors an hour — were a bust under competition from the drenching light of the Moon.
NEWSLETTER & REAL-TIME NEWS ALERTS: Get the Top Michigan Headlines from Patch Editor Beth Dalbey
The Delta Aquarids, which offer up to 20 meteors per hour, officially begin on Tuesday, July 12, and peak toward the end of the month, according to earthsky.org. There's no definite peak time for the Delta Aquarids, and the medium-speed meteors go on fairly steadily through late July and early August. If you want to pinpoint the best viewing dates on the calendar, pencil in July 28-29.
MORE ABOUT METEOR SHOWERS: Patch's Complete 2016 Meteor Shower Guide
The best viewing times are an hour or two before dawn, but the meteors will compete with a waning crescent moon in late July. You may be able to see some in early August under a new moon.
And then, get ready to rock and roll, stargazers.
In early August, the Perseids duel with the Delta Aquarids to make this a prime time for meteor shower viewing. The Perseids peak Aug. 12-13.
And there's a bonus.
The Perseid Meteor Shower is expected to have an outburst in 2016, which means there could be anywhere between 150-200 meteors per hour.
According to the American Meteor Society, normal rates range from 50-75 shower members per year, but in 2016 they will appear at double the normal rate. NASA meteor expert Bill Cooke was quoted by Space.com as saying the rate could top 150 and even reach 200 meteors per hour.
The outburst is the first of its kind since 2009.

If you want to impress your stargazing friends, point out the difference. It will be helpful to understand the concept of radiant points to do this, however.
The Delta Aquarids appear to radiate from a certain point in front of the constellation Aquarius the Water Bearer, which arcs across the southern sky in the Northern Hemisphere. The radiant point of this shower nearly aligns with the star Skat (Delta Aquarii).
The Perseids radiate from the constellation Perseus. In the Northern Hemisphere, it's located in the northeast to high in the north part of the sky, and it's visible between midnight and dawn, which also happens to be the best time to watch the Perseids.
So, if you see meteors coming from the north, they're Perseids; if they're coming from the south, they're the Delta Aquarids. If you're lucky and you're in a dark sky area — your best bet for viewing meteors in any case — you may see the Perseids and Delta Aquarids crossing to make for a spectacular sky show.
What's Ahead for the Rest of the Year?
Oct. 7, Draconids
This shower also favors the Northern Hemisphere. Great news! You don't have to stay up late to view this one, because the Draconids are most likely to fly in the evening hours. It's usually a sleeper of a sky show, earthsky.org says, but in rare instances, the constellation Draco the Dragon in the northern sky can fire off hundreds of meteors in a single hour.
Oct. 20-21,Orionids
The glare of a waning gibbous moon in the early morning hours just before sunrise could intrude with the Orionids, which typically produce 10 to 20 meteors per hour. Most meteors in this shower tend to fall after midnight, and they're typically at their best in the wee hours just before dawn. The Orionids also sometimes present bright fireballs.
Nov. 4-5, South Taurids
Though the best viewing conditions are likely to be after midnight on Nov. 5, the Taurids are very long-lasting, from Sept. 25-Nov. 25. They only offer about seven meteors an hour, but the Taurids are known for having a high percentage of fireballs. This is the first of two Taurid meteor showers, and it always adds a few more meteors to the South Taurids' peak night.
Nov. 11-12, North Taurids
This shower is long-lasting, too, from Oct. 12-Dec. 2, but modest as well with only about seven meteors an hour, with most of the activity taking place around midnight. The meteors are slow moving, but very bright. The waxing gibbous moon could outshine this year's shower.
Nov. 16-17, Leonids
Some of the greatest meteor storms in history have been associated with their event, which can produce rates of thousands of meteors per minute during a span of 15 minutes, as occurred on Nov. 17, 1966. " Some who witnessed the 1966 Leonid meteor storm said they felt as if they needed to grip the ground, so strong was the impression of Earth plowing along through space, fording the meteoroid stream," earthsky.org says.
Dec.13-14, Geminids
The last meteor shower of the year is usually one of the finest meteor showers visible in either the Northern or the Southern Hemisphere, but a full moon will be out all night, subduing the typically prolific Geminids, which can produce up to 120 meteors per hour. The shower peaks around 2 a.m.
Dec. 21-22, Ursids
This minor meteor shower often goes unnoticed. Produced by the dust grains left behind by the comet Tuttle, it produces only about five to 10 meteors an hour. The shower runs from Dec. 17-25, but it should peak around Dec. 21. The moon will be 23 days old at the time of peak activity, so it shouldn't present too much of a problem.

The fate of cryptocurrencies is still being decided in Russian regulatory circles.
Russian officials continue to explore how to go about regulating cryptocurrencies, or whether to classify them as currencies at all.
During an interview with CNBC, Central Bank of Russia's governor Elvira Nabiullina revealed that the bank is seeking a better understanding of the risks and applications of blockchain technology. On bitcoin, they said, "We don't consider that bitcoin can be considered as a virtual currency. It's more digital assets with the regulation of assets."
The comment sheds a bit of light on the direction that the pendulum is swinging in Russia; in April of 2017, Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev attempted to introduce a bill which would ban the use of the ruble on cryptocurrency exchanges. However, as reported by ETHNews, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev issued a mandate earlier this May which signaled a strong commitment to blockchain implementation, possibly as soon as 2019.
With a veil of optimism, Nabiullina describes to CNBC a perspective that acknowledges the current growth that the cryptomarket is experiencing, but bears in mind the long-term challenges Russia and other countries face when there are higher rates of growth. "[Structural bottlenecks] are different from country to country, but many countries met these challenges of aging population, of low productivity, of lack of incentives for investment."
They added, "Russia has the same bottlenecks that we need to work on."
Whether integration as a non-currency will cultivate or cull Russian cryptomarkets remains to be seen.
Some re-routed Swanston St trams will remain servicing the west of the city long after the Metro Rail project is finished.
At a business briefing on July 10, Melbourne Metro Rail Authority CEO Evan Tattersall said the longer-term plan was to permanently route some Swanston St trams through the CBD's west.
They said it was yet to determined which Swanston St trams would permanently remain routed up either Elizabeth, William or Spencer streets.
Mr Tattersall said transport authorities recognised the ascendancy of the western end of the CBD, including Docklands, and would respond with more tram services.
Mr Tattersall told the Yarra River Business Association (YRBA) that Swanston St would remain undisturbed between Collins and LaTrobe streets as underground tunneling techniques would be used.
However, the roadway between Flinders and Collins streets and LaTrobe and Franklin streets would be open-cut holes for “years”.
Mr Tattersall said, while it was hoped these areas of Swanston St would remain navigable by pedestrians for the duration of the project, there were no guarantees.
The briefing was told it was hoped that at least one side of Swanston St would remain open for pedestrians at any one time.
Mr Tattersall said there were, similarly, no decisions yet made about what becomes of the undisturbed tram-less and cycle-less sections of Swanston St between Collins and LaTrobe streets during the construction period.
Mr Tattersall said the contractors constructing the underground stations would first have to indicate their preferred routes for trucking out the significant amounts of soil from the excavations.
They said the two CBD stations, CBD North and CBD South, would be constructed at the same time. Of all the “critical assets”, the two stations would take the longest to construct.
Mr Tattersall said specific timelines were yet to be determined, but relocation of tram services were due to start in 2017, with major construction scheduled for 2018.
The Metro Rail project is due for completion in 2026, but Mr Tattersall cautioned that it could be brought forward because of the promise of relief to the existing stressed rail network.
Asked about the biggest challenge the project presented, Mr Tattersall said protecting the amenity of the city during construction was the hardest part of the project.
They said the project presented many other challenges, including:
How to locate services above the City Loop which, in some instances, was only 20 metres below the surface; and
How to cross the Yarra River.
They said the rail authority was yet to drill a further 160 core samples to determine the geo-technical nature of the terrain along the 9km route from South Kensington to South Yarra.
Mr Tattersall said the detailed preliminary work was fundamental to successful planning and implementation of the project.

Square Enix Montreal appears to have offered players the very first glimpse of the next Hitman game - just days after Hitman Absolution went on sale.
A piece of concept art, presumed to be taken from the next Hitman game, was posted to the developer's website earlier this month and appears to show Agent 47 strolling into a courthouse.
In the foreground, a news reporter is seen talking into a camera, as riot police and men in suits seal off the surrounding area.
The Square Enix Montreal logo is featured in the bottom right hand corner.
Square Enix Montreal is currently developing the next game in the Hitman franchise, presumed to be due for release at some point in 2013.
The studio, which opened earlier this year, is led by ex-Square Enix London Studios GM Lee Singleton. Numerous IO Interactive developers are said to have joined the team.
IO Interactive and Square Enix Montreal will alternate development duties on the franchise going forward, something Hitman Absolution director Tore Blystad compares to the way Treyarch and Infinity Ward handle Call of Duty.
"You have an IP that has been developed. They will feed off each other, as well as [have] some things that stand out," they said. "I think with these big franchises it takes a long time to develop just one game. If you can, work a little bit in parallel at least and help each other out."
Hitman Absolution, developed by IO Interactive, released last Tuesday. The game debuted at no. 2 in the UK All-Formats Top 40 chart.

BRONX (ChurchMilitant.com) - Following intense media scrutiny over the last 48 hours, including from ChurchMilitant.com, Fr. Peter Miqueli — the New York pastor being sued over allegedly embezzling more than $1 million to fund their perverted sex life — has resigned.
The announcement came this evening at 5:00 p.m. EST as Fr. Miqueli read a prepared statement outside of St. Francis de Chantal parish in Throggs Neck, New York. "I have made the decision to step aside from my position as pastor of this parish while this unfortunate and regrettable situation is investigated ... ."
Father Miqueli insisted that they are "not guilty of the charges" documented in the 40-page lawsuit filed Thursday by attorney Michael Dowd on behalf of parishioners at St. Frances de Chantal.
The lawsuit also charges the archdiocese of New York and Cdl. Timothy Dolan with knowledge of these embezzlement crimes while they were occurring.
Miqueli concluded by saying, "It is in the best interests of the parish that this matter be resolved without me serving as your pastor," and that "Cdl. Dolan has graciously given me permission to [resign]."
Earlier today, Cdl. Dolan admitted he's known for some time about the allegations of drug-fueled sex romps and theft by Fr. Miqueli and that the priest has been cooperating with the archdiocese. But parishioners who have spoken with ChurchMilitant.com claim Dolan is "backpedaling."
Speaking at a Catholic Charities event Saturday, Dolan acknowledged they saw the explicit content in emails detailing Miqueli's sexual shenanigans. "You bet I saw it. You bet I saw it," they said.
The emails in question, turned over by Tatyana Gudin, jilted lover of Miqueli's sex partner Keith Crist, detail perverse sex acts involving drinking Crist's urine and calling Crist "Master" (details of emails here; warning: graphic content). Gudin says they turned over the emails to Cdl. Dolan, who then requested they visit their office with all the information. Dolan claims that they failed to appear, and they then turned over the emails to the D.A.
But according to Gudin, they had initially agreed to meet with Dolan, but canceled after an archdiocesan lawyer forbade a parishioner plaintiff to accompany them "Basically they wanted me to turn over the smut so they could continue the cover-up," they said.
Dolan said Saturday, "What distresses me, I think, are the innuendo that the archdiocese is taking this with anything less than the gravity it deserves. We've been cooperating with these people. We've had a number of audits. And we're prepared to arrive at a resolution within the first of the year."
But parishioners of St. Frances de Chantal tell a different story. According to one parishioner who spoke with ChurchMilitant.com, "He's backpedaling. That letter from Zwilling [archdiocesan communications director] was a line in the sand. Now that Dolan's been approached, they seem to be [saying,] 'Oh, we love the people in Throggs Neck, we're so happy with what they're doing, it's great for them to do this."
Zwilling claims they "have not found anything that would confirm or substantiate the allegations raised."
Parishioners say they've been lodging complaints against Fr. Miqueli for at least two years, even setting up a public website and Facebook page detailing their misdeeds (which include skimming from parish donations to the tune of more than $1 million, with Keith Crist a willing participant in the embezzlement scheme). The parishioners' pleading more often than not was met with silence.
In spite of the faithful's repeated requests over 18 months that the archdiocese take action, Cdl. Dolan allowed Fr. Miqueli to continue in active ministry. The only substantive response parishioners had received up to the resignation of Fr. Miqueli was an audit of the parish ordered in August by Cdl. Dolan, which, according to parishioners, had accomplished nothing.
Dolan claims he's found "some sloppiness" in parish finances, but thus far "I found no evidence at all embezzlement." The lawsuit, however, filed Thursday, claims it has proof of extensive financial misdealings by Fr. Miqueli and Crist, who not only embezzled money from the parish, but "attempted to cover up their diversion [of funds] by destroying financial records."
Dolan claims Miqueli is "as eager as anybody to see the truth come out. If the truth comes out and it hurts him, their priesthood is obviously over. But I'm hoping that's not the case."

It's not just about bathrooms. Discrimination can lead to unemployment, poverty and even murder.

The South Dakota legislature's failure to override a gubernatorial veto killed, once and for all, a bill that would have banned transgender students from using the bathroom that matches their gender identity. This hot-button political issue is cropping up in states and workplaces all over the country, a symptom of broader and sometimes more dangerous discrimination against a minority that only recently started making its voice heard.
Just last month, a transgender woman named Georgia Carter was hired at a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Richmond, Va., only to be denied the job an hour later because the manager was unsure which restroom they would use at work. The manager was fired a few days later for violating KFC's nondiscrimination policy, which includes gender identity and expression.
The “politics of peeing,” or being denied access to the sex-segregated restroom that corresponds to one's gender identity, is just one of the many types of discrimination experienced by the approximately 700,000 Americans who identify as transgender. Last year, a record number of transgender people were murdered, almost all of them trans women of color. At least 23 trans people were killed last year in the United States and at least 81 were killed worldwide.
Monica Loera, a 43-year-old Latina trans woman in Texas, became the first reported transgender person murdered in 2016, shot and killed outside of their Austin home in late January. One month later came the murder of two black trans women, Veronica Banks Cano in San Antonio and Maya Young in Philadelphia. Less than three months into 2016, the year is already off to a grim start for transgender Americans.
Research on violence and discrimination against transgender people provides evidence that these stories are not isolated incidents. Lisa R. Miller and I recently published an article in Sociological Forum about transgender Americans' experiences of transphobic (i.e., anti-transgender) discrimination. Our analysis was based on the first-of-its-kind National Transgender Discrimination Survey, which included data from over 6,400 trans respondents. The results offer a bleak picture of the way transgender people are treated in the United States.
We found that 70% of trans people reported experiencing major events of discrimination, such as unfairly being denied a job, having to hide that they are transgender at work in order to keep their jobs or being denied medical care because of one's gender identity. In addition, 70% reported facing more subtle, everyday forms of discrimination, like harassment at work, being referred to with the wrong pronoun or having private information shared without their consent. Discrimination against trans people is widespread, occurring at work, hospitals, restaurants and stores, hotels, courtrooms, in interactions with the police, at airports, and on buses and trains.
Such discrimination has consequences that range from minor discomfort or inconvenience to unemployment, poverty and wrongful incarceration. My co-author and I also found that these experiences compromise the health of transgender people. Trans people who experience discrimination are more likely to smoke cigarettes, use drugs and alcohol, and attempt suicide.
We found that the more frequently trans people are recognized by others as transgender, the more discrimination they face — and, the more discrimination trans people face, the more likely they are to smoke, drink or use drugs, and to have attempted suicide. The message from our transphobic society is that transgender people should hide, blend in, or “convert.” The nation offered former Olympian and television star Caitlyn Jenner a warm welcome when they publicly announced that they are a trans woman. But for the majority, the everyday reality of being transgender in America is filled with discrimination and violence that seem like punishment for being different.
POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media
Most Americans tend to conflate sex (the gender a person is assigned at birth) with gender identity (which is based on internal sense of self). They often struggle to understand how someone who looks like one sex would identify as the other, and even in some cases transition surgically from one sex to another.
This helps explain some of the intense resistance to transgender people and their rising activism. Backlash is fairly common when minority groups become more visible, more vocal and more powerful, especially if they are not well understood. We are perhaps witnessing that in America right now — for example, a spike in hate-motivated violence against trans people, discrimination in the workplace and a slew of proposed state and local laws to ban trans people from using the bathroom appropriate for their gender.
This is unacceptable. As a nation, more and more of us have come to recognize and oppose discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, socioeconomic status or age. It is time to raise the country's consciousness on gender identity and expression and add them to the list of protected categories. We should be protecting transgender Americans from discrimination — not perpetuating and expanding it.

Violence against environmentalists is now at an all-time high
This is Máxima Acuña de Chaupe. They who won the 2015 Goldman Environmental Prize, and their campaigning has been recognized internationally. They have also been beaten by police, harassed, and suffered years of violence and intimidation for their efforts to stop the construction of an open-pit gold mine on their land in Northern Peru.
Sadly, stories like this are only becoming more common.
A new report by Global Witness documents an increase in violence against environmentalists, globally, by 59% from 2014. That makes 2015 was the most violent year ever.
The report, “On Dangerous Ground,” shows that more than three people are killed every week in disputes over mining, logging, agriculture development, and hydropower projects.
The worst countries for environmental activists continue to be Brazil and the Philippines. Both countries suffered a record numbers of killings last year.
As I've reported previously for Foreign Policy, the perpetrators are governments, corporations, mercenary killers, and gangs. The victims disproportionately — about 40% — indigenous people fighting to protect their homes against land and resource grabs.
In another case, Filipino activist Michelle Campos has been fighting to protect their ancestral land, the region of Mindanao, from corporations exploiting its coal, nickel, and gold. More than 3,000 indigenous Lumad people were driven from their homes, and Campos' father and grandfather were publicly executed.
“We get threatened, vilified and killed for standing up to the mining companies on our land and the paramilitaries that protect them,” said Michelle Campos. “My father, grandfather and school teacher were just three of countless victims. We know the murderers – they are still walking free in our community. We are dying and our government does nothing to help us.”
Until Warner Bros. assembles its creative team around a “Justice League” movie, the studio and DC Entertainment are focusing on getting audiences used to seeing the group's superheroes together in other ways.
Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and the Flash already appear in Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment's “Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes,” released in June, and will reunite for the videogame division's “Injustice: Gods Among Us,” out next year.
But Variety has learned that WBIE is expected to reteam some of the characters in some form for the next installment in Rocksteady Studios' gritty vidgame series that began with “Batman: Arkham Asylum” and “Arkham City.”
New, highly stylized title is being developed as a prequel that revolves around Batman's first meeting with the Joker. It's based on the Silver Age of DC's comicbooks from the 1950s when the Caped Crusader teamed with other heroes like Superman and founded the Justice League of America.
Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill voiced Batman and the Joker, respectively, in the previous games. Hamill has already said they won't be back to play the villain in the next game.

Warner Bros.' games group introduced the gritty “Batman: Arkham Asylum” game in 2009, followed by last year's “Batman: Arkham City,” which was heavily promoted at Comic-Con.
Sequel sold 2 million units worldwide in its first week and quickly topped 6 million within the first month, besting the 4.3 million that the first sold overall.
New game, “Batman: Arkham Origins” bows in November. Title was not discussed during the E3 games confab in June, with WBIE focusing on unveiling “Injustice.”
Opening up Batman's world would make sense given that Warner Bros. is eager to replicate the success Marvel and Disney have had with “The Avengers,” which has grossed $1.5 billion this summer at the worldwide box office and minted even more coin from the sale of toys and other licensed merchandise.
As Warner Bros. polishes a “Justice League” script by “Gangster Squad” scribe Will Beall that it hopes to get up on the bigscreen in 2015, the rest of the studio's divisions are making moves to fulfill Time Warner's mandate to monetize its stable of iconic superheroes:
• The studio is prepping the family pic “Lego: The Piece of Resistance,” which will star Batman and Superman as animated mini-figures.
• Warner Home Video released its animated feature-length direct-to-homevid pic “Justice League: Doom” in February.
• Cartoon Network launched a new DC Nation programming block in the spring, showcasing heroes from DC's library, with shows anchored by “Young Justice” and “Green Lantern: The Animated Series.”
• The CW will premiere “Arrow,” about the Green Arrow, this fall.
• Warner Bros. Consumer Products brokered a deal with Lego and Mattel to create action figures and playsets featuring all of DC's heroes, which include the Justice League's main members. Division earned $6 billion from licensing deals last year and hopes to grow that through the new toy pacts.
• DC Comics relaunched the “Justice League” books last year as part of the New 52 reboot.
• And DC Entertainment kicked off its “We Can Be Heroes” campaign in January, with singer Chris Daughtry as its ambassador, to raise awareness and funds to fight hunger in Africa. Effort involves Warner Bros. and Time Warner's other divisions and leans on the Justice League characters to educate the public on the issue. At Comic-Con, DC is hosting a “Darkness & Light: Art Inspired by Heroes & Villains, Hope & Heroism” art exhibit at the Michael J Wolf gallery, with sales benefitting the campaign.
These are just the first of a slew of projects expected to bow from WB's various divisions, sources tell Variety.
The first films to feature DC's heroes are coming together after Warner Bros. Pictures president Jeff Robinov took back control of how the characters are utilitzed in the studio's features in 2009. At the time, “Harry Potter” franchise flight attendant Diane Nelson was put in charge of the reorganized DC Entertainment. Shortly thereafter, plans for “Man of Steel” were announced in 2010.
While Nelson is consulting on all projects involving the Justice League and its characters, the mandate for all of WB's divisions to boost their exposure comes from higher up the Time Warner executive ladder, perhaps from CEO Jeff Bewkes, sources tell Variety.
It will be another several months before Warner Bros. announces a new slate of superhero pics, Robinov has said. Until then, all roads already appear to lead to a “Justice League” team-up in some form.
“Green Lantern” scribes Marc Guggenheim and Michael Green are writing “The Flash” for director Greg Berlanti, while another “Green Lantern” scribe, Michael Goldenberg, has been hired to write “Wonder Woman.”
Warners toppers say they plan to reveal their upcoming film plans for DC's characters within the next several months.
Until then, it's clear that Christopher Nolan — who has close ties to DC's top crime fighters after their Batman trilogy and producing duties on Superman reboot “Man of Steel,” out next summer under helm of Zack Snyder — won't direct “Justice League.” While promoting “The Dark Knight Rises,” they told reporters he's “finished” with Batman and “this is the end of our take on this character…I've got no plans to do anything more and certainly no involvement with any Justice League project.”
WBIE declined to comment on upcoming game plans, as did DC Entertainment on the “Justice League.”
On Tuesday, a CNN report seemed to confirm President Donald Trump's suspicions that the Obama administration issued surveillance on top members of Trump's campaign staff. CNN reported that Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairperson, was indeed spied upon during President Obama's tenure.
While the story does seem to confirm Trump's allegations, the truth proved rather complicated. Here are five things to know about the developing story.
1. Manafort was wiretapped, and maybe Trump was, too.
On Tuesday, CNN reporters Evan Perez, Shimon Prokupecz, and Pamela Brown reported that the federal government did indeed snoop on Trump campaign chairperson Paul Manafort.
"US investigators wiretapped former Trump campaign chairperson Paul Manafort under secret court orders before and after the election, sources tell CNN, an extraordinary step involving a high-ranking campaign official now at the center of the Russia meddling probe," the writers reported.
To make matters worse, the spying continued into early this year, when Manafort was known to be speaking with President Trump.
CNN's sources suggested that some of the evidence "sparked concerns among investigators that Manafort had encouraged the Russians to help with the campaign," but that the evidence of Russian collusion remained inconclusive.
Earlier reports suggesting that a court working under the auspices of the Foreign Intelligence Service Act (FISA) ordered wiretapping of Trump campaign officials seemed fully vindicated by the CNN bombshell, which reported that a FISA court authorized an order to spy on Manafort.
But at this point, the news becomes less rosy for Trump supporters. The original FISA order began when Manafort became the subject of an FBI investigation that began in 2014. More on this later.
The surveillance was paused last year for lack of evidence, but then resumed after a new FISA warrant was obtained. This second warrant covered an unspecified time leading into early this year.
FBI interest reportedly deepened last fall because of intercepted communications between Manafort and suspected Russian operatives. The FBI conducted a search of a storage facility belonging to Manafort.
While Manafort resigned from the Trump campaign in August of last year, after only five months on the campaign, they continued to speak with Trump after the Republican took office. They kept speaking to one another after the FBI investigation into Manafort was public knowledge, and only stopped when lawyers insisted they do so.
Manafort has denied that they ever "knowingly" communicated with Russian intelligence operatives during the election and has also denied participating in any Russian efforts to "undermine the interests of the United States."
A bunch of Republican propagandists are outraged that the press isn't showing more interest in PizzaGate Mike Cernovich's “scoop” that the woman in charge of ensuring our national security under President Obama, then National Security Advisor Susan Rice, sought to fully understand the national security intercepts they were being shown.
There are two bases for their poutrage, which might have merit — but coming from such hacks, may not.
The first is the suggestion, based off Devin Nunes' claim (and refuted by Adam Schiff) that Rice unmasked things they shouldn't have. Thus far, the (probably illegally) leaked details — such as that family members, perhaps like Jared Kushner (who met with an FSB officer turned head of a sanctioned Russian bank used as cover for other spying operations), Sean Hannity (who met with an already-targeted Julian Assange at a time they were suspected of coordinating with Russians), and Erik Prince (who has literally built armies for foreign powers) got spied on — do nothing but undermine Nunes' claims. All the claimed outrageous unmaskings actually seem quite justifiable, given the accepted purpose for FISA intercepts.
The other suggestion — and thus far, it is a suggestion, probably because (as I'll show) it's thus far logically devoid of evidence — is that because Rice asked to have the names of people unmasked, they must be the person who leaked the contents of the intercepts of Sergey Kislyak discussing sanctions with Mike Flynn. (Somehow, the propagandists always throw Ben Rhodes' name in, though it's not clear on what basis.)
Let me start by saying this. Let's assume those intercepts remained classified when they were leaked. That's almost certain, but Obama certainly did have the authority to declassify them, just as either George Bush or Dick Cheney allegedly used that authority to declassify Valerie Plame's ID (as some of these same propagandists applauded back in the day). But assuming the intercepts did remain classified, I agree that it is a problem that they were leaked by nine different sources to the WaPo.
But just because Rice asked to unmask the identities of various Trump (and right wing media) figures doesn't mean they and Ben Rhodes are the nine sources for the WaPo.
That's because the information on Flynn may have existed in a number of other places.
Obviously, Rice could not have been the first person to read the Flynn-Kislyak intercepts. That's because some analyst(s) would have had to read them and put them into a finished report (most, but not all, of Nunes' blathering comments about these reports suggest they were finished intelligence). Assuming those analysts were at NSA (which is not at all certain) someone would have had to have approved the unmasking of Flynn's name before Rice saw it.
In addition, it is possible — likely even, at least by January 2017, when we know people were asking why Russia didn't respond more strongly to Obama's hacking sanctions — that there were two other sets of people who had access to the raw intelligence on Flynn's conversations with Kislyak: the CIA and, especially, the FBI, which would have been involved in any FISA-related collection. Both CIA and FBI can get raw data on topics they're working on. Likely, in this case, the multi-agency task force was getting raw collection related to their Russian investigation.
And as I've explained, as soon as FBI developed a suspicion that either Kislyak was at the center of discussions on sanctions or that Flynn was an unregistered agent of multiple foreign powers, the Special Agents doing that investigation would routinely pull up everything in their databases on those people by name, which would result in raw Title I and 702 FISA collection (post January 3, it probably began to include raw EO 12333 data as well).
So already you're up to about 15 to 20 people who would have access to the raw intercepts, and that's before they brief their bosses, Congress (though the Devin Nunes and Adam Schiff briefing, at least, was delayed a bit), and DOJ, all the way up to Sally Yates, who wanted to warn the White House. Jim Comey has suggested it is likely that the nine sources behind the WaPo story were among these people briefed secondarily on the intercepts. And it's worth noting that David Ignatius, who first broke the story of Flynn's chats with Kislyak but was not credited on the nine source story, has known source relationships in other parts of the government than the National Security Advisor, though they also have ties to Rice.
All of which is to say that the question of who leaked the contents of Mike Flynn's conversations with Sergey Kislyak is a very different question from whether Susan Rice's requests to unmask Trump associates' names were proper or not. It is possible that Rice leaked the intercepts without declassifying them first. But it's also possible that any of tens of other people did, most of whom would have a completely independent channel for that information.
And the big vulnerability is not — no matter what Eli Lake wants to pretend — the unmasking of individual names by the National Security Advisor. Rather, it's that groups of investigators can access the same intelligence in raw form without a warrant tied to the American person in question.

Production is now officially underway on the horror sequel The Conjuring 2. Warner Bros. put the follow-up into development shortly after the smashing box office success of director James Wan's original, which executed every horror trick in the book with pitch perfect precision. There was some question over whether Wan would return to direct the sequel given that they had graduated to blockbuster filmmaking with Furious 7, but they ultimately opted to come back and steer this second entry in what could very well be a horror franchise—at least until they turn their attention to Aquaman, which is already slated as their next film after Conjuring 2.
The follow-up, titled The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Poltergeist, sees Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson reprising their roles as real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. While specific plot details are unknown, the subtitle suggests the picture will be at least partially based on poltergeist activity reported at a council house in England between 1977 and 1979 involving two young sisters.
To mark the start of filming, Wan shared photos from the set on social media with one confirming that they actually had the production blessed by a priest. Check out the photos below. The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Poltergeist opens in theaters on June 10, 2016.
Yes, we actually had a priest to bless our set on the first day of shooting Conjuring 2!! Posted by James Wan on Monday, September 21, 2015
Little management consultancy firms are as sought after as Bain & Company. Bain is ranked No. 1 in Vault's ranking of the 50 best consulting firms to work for, and is frequently rated among the world's top employers by Glassdoor.
That prestige means Bain is also one of the 25 toughest companies to interview at according to a survey from Glassdoor.
The good news is that Bain plans to hire a record number of consultants in 2017, most of whom will be MBAs. Bain is a top recruiter at most of the top-20-ranked MBA schools such as Columbia Business School and INSEAD of France. The firm employs 6,000 in 53 offices in 34 countries.
So what can business school students do to land a coveted job there?
We asked Keith Bevans, Bain's global head of consulting recruitment. Here's what the Harvard Business School graduate told us:
Q. Why does Bain love MBAs?
Because of the educational background that MBAs bring. To be in a top program you come with great work and leadership experience. The schools are only admitting the top of the top.
But also, because of the experience of going through an MBA program. Most campuses bring students from around the world together and get them through the learning curve very quickly, which is similar to what you'll do as a consultant. You might be entering a market or technology you're not familiar with. You don't get five years to figure that out. In an MBA program, you're continually challenging yourself and that is valuable.
Q. How many MBAs will you hire in 2017?
We are hiring north of 400 Consultants this year, which includes MBAs, PhDs, and Associate Consultants who are returning from business schools. Last year and the year before, we hired our largest consulting classes ever and we expect to do that again this Fall. Right now, we're planning to grow it.
Q. How important is the internship?
The intern cycle is a great way to find the best talent on campus and give them a chance to see what we do.
Ninety percent of our interns come back as full-time hires. Every intern that I hire I want to come back full-time. Which means every intern that I hire, candidly, is one less person I need to hire in the Fall. We almost always exceed our recruiting target for our intern class. I'll take everybody who is great and I'll adjust my second-year [MBA student] targets accordingly.
Q. Which business schools will you hire from?
What's important for us is to look at the top 15-20 ranked schools, which are generally the bigger programs. By the time you get down to the top the 20-25 ranked schools, you get very small programs. The math doesn't work well [because we need to recruit large numbers of students]. We also know that those top-ranked schools are very selective, and we know that all their students are strong candidates.
Q. What attributes are you looking for in consulting staff?
There are three underlying characteristics that people need to have:
1) The people who tend to be successful in our firm are the people who have that underlying problem-solving ability.
2) We are a client services business. You need to have a way of connecting with people. You have to be able to engage with people and have them open up with you so you can ask them questions.
3) You have to be able to work in teams. And this is more unique to Bain than at other firms. The people that are most successful at Bain tend to be very humble about their backgrounds. If you're the type of person who constantly feels like you need to prove you're the smartest person in the room, that's not a great fit for us. You need to check your ego at the door.
Q. What does a candidate's response to a Bain case interview question reveal?
As well as problem-solving, client servicing and team working abilities, we are looking for people who can communicate complex problems in a succinct way.
Bain people are not trying to impress you by using the most jargon. We are trying to take complicated business problems and explain them in a way that someone on the factory floor can understand, and change their behaviour accordingly. You can't do that on the front-line if you're only speaking C-suite language.
Q. What differentiates Bain from a BCG or a Mckinsey & Company?
There are a couple of things that makes us unique from our competitors:
1) You join Bain as a generalist. The staffing manager will get you a variety of experiences. We believe a broad view of business gives you the ability to bring insights from one industry to another. Our clients value that. That's where the breakthroughs come from.
2) When you join Bain, you join an office. We are a global firm, but we are a team in an office. Those relationships are valuable.
Q. Recruitment is a two-way process. What are you doing to appeal to MBAs?
It is important that we get to meet students at our events on campus. We are trying to reduce the time spent on presentations, to allow students to spend more time meeting Bain people.
Q. Tell us something most people don't know about Bain?
What's surprising for people is that that, despite the growth and the need to get people to Manager, we have open dialogue about what else people would like to do professionally, five or ten years' down the line [outside of the firm].
We send a lot of people to the Fortune 500, but you'll also see a lot of people going to small and mid-sized firms and not-for-profits. Because you have seen such a broad range of industries at Bain, you are not limited in terms of your career.
Q. How has your Harvard Business School MBA helped you at Bain?
The MBA broadens your horizons and gives you an appreciation for people with different backgrounds. Even after doing four years at Bain, working internationally with dozens of clients, what I saw at business school was a much broader set people.
For people who have been in consulting, it's also often the first extended period of time spent with people who have been in industry. You finish your MBA with an appreciation for how smart and talented people are in different industries.
On Wednesday the justices heard oral argument in National Association of Manufacturers v. Department of Defense, which will determine the venue for challenges to Clean Water Act rules. [Disclosure: Goldstein & Russell, P.C., whose attorneys contribute to this blog in various capacities, is among the counsel to the respondents in this case.] Miriam Seifter has this blog's argument analysis. John Siciliano covers the argument for the Washington Examiner.
At The Economist's Democracy in America blog, Steven Mazie discusses the court's dismissal as moot last week of one of two challenges to President Donald Trump's March 6 travel ban, noting that “[a]s one set of battles over Mr Trump's appetite for banning Muslim people from America's shores fizzles out, another is set to begin.” At The Atlantic, Garrett Epps suggests that even though the administration's “third travel-ban order may very likely be upheld” in the Supreme Court, the first two bans “and the government's inept efforts to defend [them] have permanently damaged this administration's legal credibility.”
Briefly:
The Heritage Foundation's SCOTUS 101 podcast features a discussion of “recent oral arguments, the latest action in the travel ban case, and women in the Court.”
At their eponymous blog, John Q. Barrett remarks that President Ronald Reagan's criticism of partisan gerrymandering may bear on Gill v. Whitford, in which the court will decide whether Wisconsin's electoral maps are the product of an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.
The Corporate Crime Reporter notes that even though consumer advocate Ralph Nader testified against the nomination of Justice Stephen Breyer to the Supreme Court, Breyer “[a]pparently… does not hold a grudge,” recently stopping in at the Nader-inspired American Museum of Tort Law for a one-hour tour.
In an op-ed for The Daily Caller, Kevin Daley observes that “Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch are trading barbs, rather frequently, in the first sitting of the Supreme Court's new term,” noting that “Gorsuch has frequently questioned the received wisdom of their Court, prompting from Ginsburg a flash of pique.”
We rely on our readers to send us links for our round-up. If you have or know of a recent (published in the last two or three days) article, post, podcast, or op-ed relating to the Supreme Court that you'd like us to consider for inclusion in the round-up, please send it to roundup [at] scotusblog.com. Thank you!

Music is as old as humankind. It is one of the earliest teachers. Primitive tribes used drums to communicate with other tribes, and Aboriginal Australians still keep their history alive through the musical tradition of the songline. Music helps guide our emotions through such milestones as marriage, death, and birth. It is much more important than most people realize, and can provide tremendous benefits to someone with dyslexia.
Remember learning your alphabet by singing “ABCD”? Or clapping to nursery rhymes and playing marching games? It is no surprise, with what we know today in the field of the various fields of neuroscience, that many progressive therapies include rhythm and music in their efforts to help rewire and improve the brain. It is a shame that many of the schools are cutting budgets to this essential component of learning.
Whether you perform on stage or behind a shower curtain, everyone is “musically inclined”. Everyone has a favorite band, or a favorite song. Music has been with us since the dawn of time; since we were in the womb with the heartbeat of our mother being the first instrument. Add to that the waves of the ocean and the rustling wind and you have a pretty sweet orchestra with a pretty groovy beat!
Beat or rhythm is the foundation for the organization of notes into sequences that can be repeated and performed in a group. Without it, there is randomness and chaos. It is the glue that carries us with anticipation for the next strong downbeat, dividing time into increments creating predictability and security. Did you know that patients with damage to the left hemisphere of the brain can lose the ability to perceive and produce rhythm? Those with right hemisphere damage have issues with perceiving melodies.
So how does the brain perceive music?
In their book This is Your Brain on Music, Daniel Levitin, ex-musician and record producer turned neuroscientist, says that in their laboratory for Musical Perception, Cognition and Expertise at McGill University, they found strong activations in their subjects' cerebellums while listening to music but not to noise. The cerebellum, the oldest part of the brain evolutionarily, has traditionally been thought of as the part of the brain that guides movement – think of the caveman unconsciously grasping, reaching, running in response to their survival instincts. The cerebellum, according to Levitin, appears to be tracking the beat, the rhythm in music. It is prominent when in helping performers and conductors maintain a constant tempo.
But what about the way music makes you feel?
In Levitin's studies, as well as those of Harvard professor Jeremy Schmahmann, it was also found that while listening to music, the cerebellum is strongly connected to the emotional centers of the brain – the amygdala, which is involved in remembering emotional events, and the frontal lobe, the part of the brain involved in planning and impulse control. In later studies, they found that listening to music that created “thrills and chills” caused a cascade of brain regions to become activated in a particular order: first the auditory cortex (sound components), then
the frontal regions (musical structure and expectation) and finally the mesolimbic system (arousal, pleasure) that released opioids and the production of dopamine culminating in the activation of the nucleus accumbens.
So how does dyslexia fit in?
According to Dr. Books, who is a proponent of brain-synchronization by means of first addressing the primitive brain (which includes the cerebellum), music can be greatly beneficial for a developing brain and for a brain with neural gaps due to physical trauma (motor function) or emotional trauma (limbic). By engaging in rhythmic, sonic and emotionally engaging activity, the brain that has trouble reading and recognizing sounds can have a better chance of being freed, re-charged and re-wired. Music seems to address all areas of the brain connections. As Levitin says, “the story of the your brain on music, is the story of an exquisite orchestration of brain regions, involving both the oldest and newest parts of the human brain, and regions as far apart as the cerebellum in the back of the head and the frontal lobes just behind your eyes. It involves a precision choreography of neurochemical release and uptake between logical prediction systems and emotional reward systems. Your brain on music… is all about connections.”
With Books Neural Therapy™, Dr. Phyllis Books' therapy for learning and behavioral issues like dyslexia and ADHD, these brain connections are made to sing together in harmony once again. In a brain/body where the record has been skipping for some time, BNT can get them back “in the groove”!

The U.S. healthcare system is ranked the worst among 11 developed nations, according to a new study.
The Commonwealth Fund measured elements including care, access, administrative efficiency, equity and healthcare outcomes in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Its analysis found the U.S. spent the most money on healthcare and also ranks poorly in terms of access, equity and healthcare outcomes.
Nearly half of low-income Americans, 44 percent, were found to have trouble getting access to healthcare coverage, while just 26 percent of high-income Americans were found to have issues getting coverage.

As reported earlier today, Anheuser-Busch InBev, the country's largest brewer, has agreed to purchase New York-based Blue Point Brewing Company, a move that reflects the beer giant's growing interest in the craft segment — and its consumers' thirst for variety.
Exact terms of the Blue Point deal, announced this morning, were not disclosed, but sources familiar with the transaction said it could be valued between $18 and $24 million.
Mark Burford, Blue Point's co-founder and brewmaster, said that negotiations with A-B InBev began last year and have been going on for “many months.”
Peter Cotter, the co-founder and president of Blue Point, said he's excited about the opportunity to become a part of A-B InBev's craft portfolio, which also includes Goose Island Brewery, a Chicago-based craft brewer that was purchased for $38.8 million in 2011.
“All of the employees will be able to maintain their jobs and the credibility and quality of the brand will remain,” Cotter said. “It's great for the community. With the kinds of resources from A-B coming into Patchogue (Long Island), it will create job growth and the sky is the limit for where the brand could go.”
According to IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm, Blue Point's dollar sales grew just over 20 percent in 2013, to more than $4.2 million, in multi-outlet and convenience stores (which includes supermarkets, drugstores, mass market retailer, military, dollar and club). Dollar sales for the company's flagship Toasted Lager, which accounts for about 50 percent of production, were up 11.5 percent.
However, it wasn't necessarily Blue Point's impressive growth numbers that attracted A-B InBev to the deal. Instead, the opportunity to add greater depth to its current set of craft offerings was a primary consideration, said Andrew Goeler, A-B InBev's vice president of imports, craft and specialties.
“This fulfills the consumer demand for variety and is a nice complimentary portfolio to what Goose Island offers,” Goeler said. “Blue Point has some excellent brands and having access to the A-B system is something that is really important.”
That system includes access to multiple brewing facilities across the country and an intricate network of wholesalers that will be granted the first rights to distribute Blue Point beers. For A-B InBev, the deal hinges on efficiencies that come alongside the expansion of a higher-margin portfolio.
“Similar to what we do with Goose Island, where we make some of the beers at an A-B brewery, we have the same opportunity to expand with Blue Point,” said Goeler. “We will be able to get the brands out to A-B wholesalers and will allow consumers to have access to these great beers.”
Blue Point production is already conducted on a contract basis — it produced a large portion of its 60,000 barrels brewed in 2013 under contract at North American Breweries' facility in Rochester, N.Y.
Plugging the brand into the A-B InBev wholesaler network, however, could prove to be a more difficult task. Blue Point currently distributes its beer in 15 states, but a number of its distributors — like Peerless Beverage and Shorepoint Distributing in New Jersey — are aligned with MillerCoors. Meanwhile, L. Knife & Son operations that sell A-B InBev products in New York and Massachusetts could also be at risk for losing the brand to wholly-owned A-B InBev distributors.
“Those decisions will be up to the A-B wholesaler and the existing wholesaler,” Goeler said. “Those kinds of conversations will occur at the local level. Even when we did the Goose Island partnership, there were competitor wholesalers that had Goose Island and they worked it out amongst themselves.”
Nevertheless, Goeler said Blue Point will have immediate access to A-B InBev's wholesale network in the 35 states where its beers are not currently sold.
“If we roll into a new state with Blue Point, it will go to the A-B wholesaler for sure,” they said. “That expanded footprint is a key piece of what we can offer a company like Blue Point.”
Bill Hayde, the co-founder of Intercontinental Beverage Capital, a New York-based middle-market investment group that is currently advising on deals for a number of beverage companies, said they believe A-B InBev was attracted to Blue Point's strong focus on its home region.
“I think what they liked is that it is concentrated in certain areas and they owned their territory,” they said. “Blue Point owns Long Island and they have worked hard to grow a presence there. I think it will add a lot of value as A-B continues to recognize the growing demand for strong, local craft brands.”
Goeler made similar remarks.
“I think the thing we liked the most is Blue Point's location,” they said. “This is a growing part of the country and gives us a nice footprint with a local brand out of Long Island.”
As expected when a craft brewer is purchased by one of the big brewers, immediate consumer reaction to the deal wasn't positive. A number of fans took to Twitter (and even the comments section of Brewbound) to express their displeasure with the announcement, with some calling the deal “Goose Island, part 2.”
“I think what we saw was a similar response initially with Goose Island,” said Goeler. “Over time, as we have proven with Goose Island, we are letting them operate just as they are. We are helping them with some of the resourcing opportunities for distribution, but I think we have a little bit of history and credibility. If anything, we are doing innovating more and creating new brand out of our Fulton Street Brewery in Chicago. We hope to do the same with Blue Point.”
The deal is expected to close in the second quarter, according to A-B InBev.
Ironically enough, Blue Point once mocked A-B InBev's acquisition of Goose Island with a faux April Fool's Day news release claiming the brewery was being sold to MillerCoors. The release, which is still posted on the company website, reads that Blue Point is “independently owned with no corporate ties. Ever.”
Never say “never,” right?

Latvia's most important national holiday is arguably not Christmas but the summer solstice celebrations of Ligo (pronounced "leegwa") - a pagan tradition when Latvians celebrate the shortest night by staying up to greet the rising sun.
As the sun slowly sets about an hour and a half before midnight, it peeks out briefly from behind the clouds.
We all run out excitedly. Five minutes later, it is gone. For a festival which is all about celebrating the sun, the sun itself is being remarkably coy.
The weather has been poor all day but this is a beautiful, if fleeting, moment.
In this far northern land, winters are long, dark and snowy, with the temperature regularly falling below -30C, so you can understand why the arrival of the long summer days is greeted by something approaching national hysteria.
It is widely thought that Latvia enjoys a mini baby-boom every year, about nine months after Ligo
It is not a complicated festival. All you have to do is head out to the countryside, get a fire going, stay up all night waiting for the sun to come up and drink lots and lots of beer - which, I can only assume, is why it is called Ligo, the Latvian word for "sway".
Women pick flowers to make into crowns for their heads, while men are supposed to strip naked and jump into a nearby lake or river.
Everyone sings medieval Latvian songs around the fire and couples are encouraged to disappear into the forest to look for a mythical flowering fern.
As a result of this particular tradition, it is widely thought that Latvia enjoys a mini baby-boom every year, about nine months after Ligo - no doubt all the drinking also has something to do with it.

The songs, the flowers, the running around naked are all signs of the pagan roots which Latvians are proud of and which have made the country what it is today.
Over the centuries, this tiny nation has been invaded by Swedes, Russians, Germans (with the Russians and the Germans even coming back for a second go) and ancient traditions helped Latvians hang on to their sense of national identity, even in the darkest days of foreign occupation.
During the years of Soviet rule, Latvian songs and poems were an important part of the resistance movement, eventually culminating in the so-called Singing Revolution in the late 1980s.
People here showed their desire for independence from the Soviet Union through mass singing events. The songs galvanised the independence movement by reminding Latvians of their pre-Soviet identity.
The midsummer celebrations are also a symbol of a romanticised and - in some ways quite fictional - rural past, and they are a reminder of a time before Stalin destroyed the Latvian countryside by sending small landowners to the gulags.
Midsummer was the point when farmers had finished ploughing and sowing the crops, and had not yet started the harvest. A good time to have a party.
Today in a globalised world of lattes and wi-fi, such ancient traditions seem to be more important than ever.
Zara and Costa Coffee may have arrived in Riga, but it is also more common than ever to see people walking round the streets in medieval national costume on public holidays.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Wearing oak-leaf wreaths is a traditional element of the festival
High-quality Latvian-made designs are seen as more fashionable than anything H & M might have to offer.
But the traditions are also constantly in flux. My Latvian friends could not quite agree whether the Ligo tradition of jumping over the bonfire guaranteed you wealth, luck or love. To be on the safe side, we all did it anyway.
And there seemed to be a bit of controversy over whether the flowers in the girls' hair meant they were virgins or just looking for love. As all the women had flowers on their heads, including a pregnant friend of mine, I can only assume that the general understanding was the latter.
The missionaries obviously hoped that the Balts would soon forget their pagan, nature-worshipping ways
Because this is the night when evil spirits are about, traditionally Latvians would protect their livestock by decorating them with wreaths made from branches and leaves.
Modern Latvians have more wealth invested in their cars than their cows, so today bumpers and wing mirrors are adorned with greenery instead.
And even the date is a little bit confused. The actual summer solstice is a few days before Ligo. It is thought it was moved after Christianity arrived in the Baltics in the 12th Century, to coincide with St John the Baptist's feast day.
The missionaries obviously hoped that the Balts would soon forget their pagan, nature-worshipping ways - instead they kept doing the same thing, just a few days later.
The advantage of this rather loose definition of tradition is that it can be easily adapted.
At this particular Ligo celebration, there was a large group of French visitors so, as the Latvian sun came up, it was greeted by a long, wobbly line of people who had certainly done their bit with the Latvian beer but had dropped the traditional Latvian songs, in favour of a rather chaotic French cancan.

Given the nature of the community, a good many of the posts were humorous (or attempted humor). The problem was that if someone made a sarcastic remark, a few readers would fail to get the joke, and each of them would post a lengthy diatribe in response…
This problem caused some of us to suggest (only half seriously) that maybe it would be a good idea to explicitly mark posts that were not to be taken seriously. After all, when using text-based online communication, we lack the body language or tone-of-voice cues that convey this information when we talk in person or on the phone. Various “joke markers” were suggested, and in the midst of that discussion it occurred to me that the character sequence :-) would be an elegant solution.
Three of New Zealand's most offensive and controversial place names will be changed if the public supports a proposal before the New Zealand Geographic Board.
Photo: NZ Topo Map screenshot
Three place names using the 'n-word' - Nigger Hill, Niggerhead and Nigger Stream, which are all in the foothills of the Southern Alps - are likely to be replaced.
The names have been in use for 150 years and there is no well-known story behind why they were chosen.
The proposed replacement names are Kānuka Hill, Tawhai Hill and Steelhead Stream, which have been suggested by the person who submitted the proposal because they represent native trees in the area and also a type of trout, the steelhead.
But it's likely Ngāi Tahu will submit its own suggestions to the board during the consultation period, which runs from the end of October through to January.
There is also a Darkie Creek in Auckland, and three other 'Darkies' names in Westland. These appear to be named after 'Darkie' Addison, a highly successful African-American prospector who made three major gold discoveries in the 1860s. There are no proposals to alter any of those names.
Other potential changes announced by the New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB) include changing the name of Rainbow Mountain to Maunga Kākaramea.
Another proposes to correct the spelling of three names in South Otago from Tokomairiro River to Tokomairaro River.
NZBGB's secretary Wendy Shaw says, "While both spellings were used from the mid-1800s, the NZGB accepts that Tokomairaro is correct and describes the method of pushing waka (canoes) or mōkihi (rafts) along the river with a pole".
And one of the Wairarapa's oldest settlements, Lake Ferry may have its name reconsidered in another proposal currently before the board.
Yesterday the Waitangi Tribunal recommended that Whanganui be spelt on all occasions with the 'h', and never as Wanganui. The Tribunal said there is only one correct way of spelling the place name.
The NZGB has also recommended that macrons are added to a number of place names, but other Maori place names, which are misspelt, remain unchanged.
Meanwhile, there is one place name that could be quite easily spelt wrong: New Zealand is home to the longest place name in the world -Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu.
It contains 85 letters, 27 more than the next longest name in Wales which is Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch.
Misspelt Māori names that remain unchanged:
Remuera - Remuwera
Hataitai - Whataitai
Maitai - Mahitahi or Maitahi
Motueka -Motuweka
Wakatipu -Whakatipu
Wanaka -Wānaka
Petone -Pito-one
Epuni -Te Puni
Waihola -Waihora
Tolaga Bay -Uawā
Macrons
The NZGB has recommended macrons are added to the following names on maps and charts. These are recorded (not official) names:
Hapuku Reef -Hāpuku Reef
Kaka Island - Kākā Island
Kakapo River - Kākāpō River
Kakapo Saddle - Kākāpō Saddle
Kakapo Spur - Kākāpō Spur
Kuri Creek - Kurī Creek
Maori Gully - Māori Gully
Maori Point - Māori Point
Marahau -Mārahau
Marahau River - Mārahau River
Mariri - Māriri
Mokihinui Forest - Mōkihinui Forest
Nakahi Stream - Nākahi Stream
Ngarua Caves - Ngārua Caves
Oparara - Ōpārara
Otuwhero Inlet - Otūwhero Inlet
Otuwhero River - Otūwhero River
Rata Hill - Rātā Hill
Rip and Tear Pakihi - Rip and Tear Pākihi

HUNTSVILLE, Alabama - Dunkin' Donuts, absent from the Huntsville restaurant scene since 2002, will return with four locations to be built in north Huntsville over the next five years.
The company announced Tuesday that a development agreement had been reached with the Robinson family and Southern Food Services.
The first restaurant here is scheduled to open next year, with the other three to be completed by 2016.
Dunkin' Donuts, founded in 1950, was last in Huntsville in 2002 on Wynn Drive, according to listings in Huntsville city directories.
"We are excited to bring Dunkin' Donuts to northern Huntsville and play an important role in the daily lives of people who live, work and visit here," Blake Robinson, vice president of Southern Food Services, said in a release. "We have a passion and loyalty for the brand, and look forward to the opening of our restaurants in the years to come."
Dunkin' Donuts said local franchise opportunities are still available in south Huntsville, Guntersville, Decatur, Athens, Scottsboro and Muscle Shoals, among other places.
"Dunkin' Donuts is excited to expand into north Huntsville," Grant Benson, vice president of franchising and market planning for Dunkin' Brands, Inc., said in the release.
"Our secret to success is our passionate franchisees who provide a high level of customer service to our guests every day.
"We believe the Robinsons will cultivate lasting customer relationships in the northern Huntsville area and become an integral part of their communities."
Dunkin' Donuts, based in Canton, Mass., is best-known as a doughnut and coffee chain. After expanding its menu recently, Dunkin' Donuts now offers frozen and iced beverages, a full bakery assortment, breakfast sandwiches and an all-day menu that includes flatbread sandwiches, hash browns and biscuits, among other things.
Dunkin' Donuts has more than 9,700 restaurants in 31 countries. Its worldwide sales last year were $6 billion, according to the release.
After yesterday's dentist visit, I decided that some retail/Detroit soul music therapy was exactly what I needed and this record by Little Ann fits the bill perfectly.
After moving to Detroit from Chicago in 1957, Ann Bridgeforth began singing in church and soon moved on to local clubs. It was there they adopted the stage name Little Ann which was originally their family's name for them as they were the youngest of seven brothers and sisters.
Them first single was for Ric Tic Records in 1968. “Going Down A One Way Street (The Wrong Way)” was demoed for label owner Ed Wingate who didn't care for it and rewrote the lyrics and arrangements the day they arrived at the studio to record the song. The single was backed with a random instrumental track and, without much promotion from the label, did not sell well.
But before their sessions with Ric Tic, Little Ann had spent time in the studio with Darrell Goolsby and Dave Hamilton who started Da Da Music Productions in the mid ‘60s. Hamilton got their start working as a Motown session musician and Goolsby was a young singer and writer. The duo worked with Ann to record a number of songs, mostly original compositions but, unfortunately, none of them would be released. Instead, the tapes would sit in Hamilton's house for the next 40 years.
Ann would move to Canada where they continued working as a live performer and released a handful of singles. They abandoned their career in 1977 to take a job with the Chrysler Motor Corporation.
In the early 1980s, a British DJ named Richard Searling began playing a track called "When He's Not Around" that they attributed to a fictitious singer named Rose Valentine. The song became a huge hit in the northern soul scene.
It wasn't until 1988 when two British soul collectors, Gilly and Andy Taylor, found themselves in a meeting with Dave Hamilton where they began playing lost gems of their collection. They pulled out a reel that had "The Possible Little Ann Album" written on it. Even though it was played slower, the pair immediately recognized a track called “What Should I Do” as Rose Valentine's hit “When He's Not Around”.
Little Ann's music began appearing on UK soul compilations and they were even flown to the UK to perform in the late 90s.
Even though Bridgeforth died in 2003, their debut album was finally released by Timmion Records in 2009.
Cape Town - The Cheetahs deny that they have been officially invited to join the Pro12 next year.
With SANZAAR cutting Super Rugby from 18 teams to 15 in 2018, and with two South African teams set to get the chop, the Cheetahs and the Kings have emerged as the favourites to lose their Super Rugby status.
But, according to a report published on the BBC website on Thursday, the Cheetahs were formally invited to take part in the Pro12 - a European competition that currently includes club teams from Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales.
It is one of three professional domestic leagues in Europe - the other two being the English Premiership and the French Top 14.
There have been suggestions that this should be the route that the Cheetahs and Kings go, but until now there has been no indication that it might happen.
The report suggests that the Pro12 is seeking ways to increase its revenue and marketability.
Sport24 got hold of the Cheetahs for comment, and while they could not deny that there had been communication with the Pro12, they were adamant that there had been no official offer to join.
In terms of their Super Rugby future, the Cheetahs could not comment, saying that the matter was "sub judice".
Steve Coppell comes to Jamshedpur FC with a simple philosophy: Don't be fake. Be Steve Coppell. Be the best Steve Coppell you can be.
But they were never meant to be here in the first place.
Coppell's India odyssey took a sharp turn in July 2017. Indian Super League's (ISL) the newest entrants, Jamshedpur FC, had convinced the man - who was on the verge of getting back to the Kerala Blasters for a second season - to sign for them for their first outing in professional football. "I had agreed a new deal with Kerala, and then for various reasons it just seemed to evaporate," they tell ESPN.
Coppell's 322 appearances for Manchester United and 987 games as manager in England could be precisely what Jamshedpur need in their ISL debut.
"The mood is full of anticipation," Coppell says of the newly-formed group of players carefully picked from the ISL draft and the transfer market. Paying Rs 1.1 crore (about $169,400) to pick Anas Edathodika (the joint-costliest Indian player) and Rs 87 lakh ($133,970) for Subrata Pal (the costliest Indian goalkeeper), Coppell and their crew also managed to sign eight foreigners -- six of whom have already played in the ISL -- and two (José 'Tiri' Arroyo and Sameehg Doutie) with a winners' medal.
"There was something really challenging about the whole experience, of a new franchise, of a new city, a challenging city geographically. I had a chat with the people I trust, my loved ones and they just said go for it."
Jamshedpur's roster is exciting. Tiri, Anas and Subrata at the back. Doutie, Bikash Jairu and Kervens Belfort on the wings with some flair coming from Trindade Goncalves in midfield. These are all players who know the ISL, the conditions and the hymns of the league.
So, Steve must be ready for the season, then?
"I don't think any coach thinks that their team is 100% ready. There are glitches, little things you think we could have done better and we should have spent more time doing. We got two away games to begin with. It is difficult in any league in the world. As much as we are looking forward to it, we respect both teams we are going to play against and know that we will have to get to speed very, very quickly."
In the past three-four weeks, the team has primarily been doing two things: training and attending functions. The latter, Steve says, is an attempt to "try and make the people of Jamshedpur aware of football and the coming season." Jamshedpur as a city is not new to football. Jamshedpur FC's home ground has been in existence since 1991 and the city boasts of one of India's best-run football academies -- the Tata football academy -- which was started in 1987. But Coppell, after seeing the delirium in Kerala, wants to make sure people flock to their 60,000 seater stadia.
The players were taken aback by the massive reception they received at the launch of our home kit. Watch how it panned out! ��#JamKeKhelo pic.twitter.com/Ffxbs87bTp - Jamshedpur FC (@JamshedpurFC) 12 November 2017
"I hope that in time the people of Jamshedpur will embrace this football team the way the Blasters fans embrace theirs."
As the talk goes to what kind of football they are looking to impart, the Englishman uses the term "Chameleon team" -- playing to adapt. "As an ex-winger I like to see width in the play. But sometimes it's not possible. Either because of injuries or personnel or whatever. I like to see pace, but sometimes you have to change accordingly and see the opposition and see their strengths and weaknesses in a very short season."
Coppell uses the word 'short season', because they still don't believe the shift from a two-month league to a five-month one makes the league any bigger, on what they call a "hit and run" league, saying, "You can go on competing on a world stage by playing 30 games a season in sporadic bursts."
"A piece of advice when I first came into management is just be yourself. I am myself. I just look and do my best on a daily basis to create an environment that the players feel they can express themselves. Inevitably, because you live with the players, they see your flaws and you wish possibly sometimes they didn't see them, but at the end of five months you get to know each other almost intimately and the real person is exposed so I don't profess to be any kind of coach, manager, mentor, man-manger, motivator, anything."
The team's biggest problem, which shouldn't be used as an "excuse", they say, is travelling. Jamshedpur doesn't have an airport. The team travelled for its first game to Guwahati from Ranchi, a three-hour bus ride from Jamshedpur. The second nearest airport is Kolkata, which is a four-hour train journey.
But with a year in India under their belt, Coppell has a head start. "Yes, I have a little bit of experience, but not a great deal. Experience is not going to help us win games, but it might help us prepare a little a better."
Steve Coppell remains realistic with their 'Chameleon team', but more importantly they are being himself.
A kangaroo is said to have drowned a dog in a Canberra park
The desperate marsupials have been attacking people and other animals as drought conditions drive them to seek food in the Canberra suburbs.
Wildlife authorities said the normally harmless, grass-eating animals were grazing on fields or golf courses.
Officials said a woman and their dog had recently been attacked, and two dogs hurt in a separate incident.
Government wildlife ecologist Murray Evans told The Associated Press: "Kangaroos don't come bounding out of the bush looking for people to attack.
"It's usually kangaroos minding their own business and people thinking they're cute and cuddly and getting too close."
But in a recent letter to the Canberra Times, dog owner Christine Canham said their pet had been drowned by a kangaroo in a city park.
The dogs had been swimming when a large kangaroo appeared on the bank and entered the water, they said.
The kangaroo "held them under the water with its back legs and drowned them as we watched helpless," Ms Canham wrote.
Kangaroos can weigh up to 80 kilograms (176 pounds) and grow as tall as an average person.
Experts say they rarely attack humans, but because of the shortage of food could be more likely to stand their ground if confronted.
I believe what we are witnessing toward the end of 2016 is a new level of self indulgence slowly poisoning our minds. An expectation that if things do not go the way I want them to then I should kick and yell until it changes or until enough people hear my anger and acknowledge my pain. This personal philosophy, otherwise known as being a sore loser, breeds more hatred and dissolution. It feeds of our insecurities and latches onto conflict. It causes disharmony and worst of all sets a standard for others to follow, a ripple effect of sorts that keeps growing. Open your eyes my fellow earthlings, 2016 isn't the problem, we are.
We are so darn entitled that we've forgotten how to take no for an answer. We're so damn obsessed with equality that we've disproportionately loved ideals more than one another, we're so frikken caught up in what society demands that we've become enslaved to the social media machine. We're no longer in control of our destiny, unable to reject popular opinion because of a fear of being ostracised. We are very slowly becoming what we believe 2016 is - horrible.
We, myself included, need a harsh slap across the wrist, a kick in the butt that reminds us of a certain message Christmas promotes. Out of all the suffering in the world, out of all the despair and all the horror, in the darkest of mangers and coldest of nights a light is born that can change the world. Forget starting off 2017 as a new year, look within yourself and start of this very second as a new moment. An opportunity to rise above the barriers of happiness and live with joy in our hearts.
Have a merry and blessed Christmas and may your 2017 be every bit as wonderful as your 2016.
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Recognizing the limits of traditional advertising, established technology companies are diving headlong into the sometimes chaotic landscape of social media to promote their products.
A Facebook profile is seen in a handout photo. REUTERS/Handout
Companies ranging from PC maker Dell Inc to storage equipment maker NetApp Inc are increasingly turning to outside blogs, viral videos and websites such as FaceBook, Twitter, FriendFeed and Digg — and their tens of millions of users — to reach consumers.
These social networking sites harness the age-old power of the word-of-mouth recommendation and can be potent marketing tools. If nothing else, they demand a higher level of consumer engagement than conventional ads.
“This is 180 degrees from that sort of advertising,” said Debra Aho Williamson, a senior analyst at eMarketer. “Having a conversation with them (consumers) is a very new skill.”
For tech companies with big marketing budgets, the shift to social media is an implicit acknowledgment that television and print are not necessarily the most effective ways to reach buyers, particularly younger ones.
In addition, with a recession looming, corporate budgets are being slashed. UBS has forecast global ad spending will fall 3.9 percent in 2009. In such an environment, social media could prove to be a cost-effective way to sell to consumers.
But the strategy is not without some risk. While every company wants to generate buzz, online backlash can be brutal.
Consumer healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson learned that the hard way with a recent Web video ad for its Motrin painkiller. While apparently trying to be irreverent about the pain of wearing a baby in a sling, the ad offended many mothers who savaged it on Twitter, the wildly popular “micro-blogging” site where users communicate with short “tweets” of 140 characters or fewer. J&J was forced to apologize on Monday.
Brian Keeler, a vice president at media consultancy VShift, said the key to social media is credibility and enlisting consumers in the act of marketing itself. But if you upset your audience, it can mean trouble.
“With the online media, things can go viral and spin out of control really fast,” they said.
ONLINE CREDIBILITY
Dell has a dedicated team of around 40 people that interacts with consumers through its blogs, community forums and third-party sites. The company began its social media push last year as it moved to repair its public image.
“There's been a realization over the last several years that your customers are going to talk about you online and you have a choice to join that conversation,” spokesperson Caroline Dietz said.
Dell said it has used Twitter to sell $500,000 worth of refurbished PCs. The company also took ideas solicited from its IdeaStorm site to make changes to its Latitude laptop.
NetApp sells data storage equipment only to enterprises, so its strategy is more limited. Its employees are encouraged to blog on third-party sites about its products and the company focuses on keeping a unified message.
Still, NetApp said that, for the first time, it is dedicating 20 percent of its PR budget to social media.
One of the most effective social media advertising strategies, said author and blogger Dave Taylor, is to simply hand a new product over to a blogger for a test-drive.
A bad review can hurt, but an endorsement from an established name “makes for some powerful marketing,” they said.
In a similar vein, hard-drive maker Seagate Technology sponsored prominent blogger Robert Scoble, who wrote about the company's products and took part in promotions.
Seagate news now goes up on Facebook, pictures of products go on photo-sharing site Flickr, along with Twitter tweets. The company has even built a studio to film Web videos.
Although some companies may balk at the idea of relinquishing control of their message, they may have no choice.
“Historically, companies have been really focused on controlling the information they disseminate ... and the fact is that's dying, because accessibility and communication have so dramatically increased and improved,” Taylor added.
France and Germany battle to save the single currency as Europe is plunged back into turmoil days after rescue deal
The French president Nicolas Sarkozy and German chancellor Angela Merkel will hold emergency talks on Wednesday in a desperate attempt to hold the eurozone together and formulate a response to the Greek prime minister's plan for a referendum on the austerity measures imposed by their European partners.
George Papandreou's socialist government is on the brink of collapse after their referendum plan sparked an angry reaction within their own party and plunged Europe back into turmoil, just days after a complex rescue deal had been agreed – requiring Greece to embark on tough cost-cutting measures.
While Papandreou's cabinet approved unanimously their decision to hold a referendum, it threatens to split the prime minister's Pasok party. One MP, Milena Apostolaki, has quit in disgust at the idea of a referendum and several colleagues have said that if it is not abandoned they will join them Papandreou faces a vote of confidence on Friday. A split in the Pasok party would almost certainly bring down the Greek government, which now has a majority of just two MPs in parliament.
The Greek finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, who was rushed to hospital after the referendum announcement, said Papandreou had kept them in the dark over their plan to announce a vote.
As global markets tumbled, Papandreou assembled their cabinet, allowing their ministers to air their views on their surprise decision to call the vote. They told them the referendum remained the only way of overcoming public opposition to the spending cuts agreed as part of the eurozone rescue package. "Everything now rests on the vote of confidence."
They predicted that any stock market turmoil would be shortlived, adding: "No one will be able to doubt Greece's course within the euro." Late last night their cabinet colleagues unanimously backed their referendum decision.
Stock markets had reacted with alarm to the prospect that the €1tn deal to rescue the euro currency union was in danger of collapse. The FTSE 100 closed down 2.2% at 5421 after an initial fall of 5%. The German Dax index and French Cac remained 5% down at the close, while the Dow Jones closed down almost 2.5%.
Sarkozy and Merkel have arranged a meeting on Wednesday evening with officials from the EU and IMF, which has already lent money to Greece and is involved in talks about further rescue funds. The meeting will take place in Cannes hours before both leaders are due to meet Barack Obama, who is flying to France for the G20 summit, which begins on Thursday. Obama wants the eurozone countries to end the uncertainty and agree a sustainable financial package.
After Greece, Italy is seen as the most vulnerable to a lending boycott by international investors, following a series of broken promises on reforms by the prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. The Italian president, Giorgio Napolitano, added to the febrile atmosphere by saying it was their duty to verify whether the conditions were in place for reforms to be implemented. The statement, couched in highly formal terms, appeared to indicate that Napolitano would consider a new government, with representatives from outside Berlusconi's centre-right coalition.
German officials, visibly angry at the prospect of a referendum, said a no vote in the referendum could plunge Greece into bankruptcy and force it out of the eurozone. German newspapers asked if their government, which has committed the largest contribution to the bailout fund, should maintain its support.
Michael Roth, Europe spokesperson for the opposition Social Democrats in Berlin, said Papandreou's move showed courage but they were "playing with fire". They said: "If the Greeks are not ready to support Papandreou's reforms, Greece faces an uncertain future in Europe."
The rescue deal that Papandreou now intends to put to the vote will allow Greece access to €130bn of extra funds needed to maintain public spending and pay wages following a 50% write-off of its debts.
A €1tn firewall of insurances and guarantees is also intended to protect Italy and Spain from any panic by international lenders over their solvency.
Greek unions have held general strikes in protest at austerity measures that form part of the agreement, which include widespread public sector spending cuts and reductions in wages and pensions. The Greek government is also expected to sell off airports and utility companies.
A poll at the weekend showed nearly 60% of Greeks had a negative or partly negative view of the rescue deal.
Norbert Barthle, of Merkel's Christian Democrats, said the referendum call put a big question mark around the aid package, complicating plans to get banks to accept 50% -percent losses on their Greek debt holdings.
Greece is due to receive €8bn aid in mid-November, but is likely to run out of cash again in January, around the time of the referendum. Countries such as Germany, Finland and the Netherlands may find it difficult to defend funnelling more cash to Athens over the coming months with the threat of the referendum looming.
The Dutch opposition Labour Party described Papandreou's gambit as a "dealbreaker" that would doom parliamentary approval of the latest rescue measures.
However, German Eurosceptics welcomed Papandreou's announcement, saying it was time European voters were consulted on what some Berlin parliamentarians believe is a doomed policy of never-ending bailouts.
"You can't keep carrying out policies against the will of the people, it won't work," ruling Free Democrat lawmaker Frank Schaeffler told Reuters. "In Greece and in Germany we are making the mistake of not consulting the population enough in this process. I fear that the Greek people will speak out against these measures because they haven't been consulted, which will mean the collapse of this debt bailout logic."
Others described the announcement as poorly thought-out and warned that the consequences could drag down the entire 17-member currency bloc.

When Marine veteran Daniel Rey Wolfe signed on to Facebook on Monday night and announced they were taking their own life, documenting the process in a graphic timeline of final self-portraits, their former comrades worked quickly and purposefully to save their brother-in-arms.
Their best efforts came too late. Wolfe had killed himself—a fact that Facebook reminded them of over the next two days, as the social-media site refused to remove the grisly series of photographs he'd taken of their suicide, despite the requests of their friends and veterans' organizations.
Wolfe was an amphibious assault vehicle crewman in the Marine Corps, a father, and a lifelong artist with a passion for loud music and graphic design. They also appeared to struggle with money and politics and purpose—struggles that culminated in Wolfe taking their own life with a blade in a squat outside Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Monday night.
Wolfe's passing is the kind of postwar tragedy that illustrates how American veterans still need more resources and counseling than they're getting, as the wars wind down and the Department of Veteran Affairs wrestles with corruption and increased workloads.
But their suicide also throws into relief the difficulties that social networks face in creating a one-size-fits-all policy to moderate photographs and status updates. And, critically, it reveals a macabre blind spot in Facebook's "community standards," behind which a suicide victim's final moments can appear on the site indefinitely, despite the protestations of people who loved him.
"His friends and family were exposed to images they should never have to [have] seen," Douglas Tripp, one of Wolfe's former Marine comrades told me in an email. "Who needs to see their son, brother, cousin or friend like that? They will remove a picture of a bare ass or exposed breast with the quickness. How are those more dangerous than a young man mutilating themselves before they commit suicide?"
Wolfe served in the Corps from 2004 to 2008, including a trip to Iraq. An imposing guy at 6'3" and anywhere from 260 to 300 pounds, they "had a good personality and could burn pretty much anyone," one shipmate said of them in a Facebook tribute. Their social media postings depict a man with a soft spot for their drawings, their daughter, and guns, not unlike many of their comrades.
But he'd had a rough time of it lately. In recent years, they collected a string of speeding tickets and two arrests for undisclosed charges in Southern California. They were taken in for public intoxication in Texas. And they were known by the police—not as a troublemaker, but as a troubled man—in their latest haunt, the Tulsa suburb of Broken Arrow. "We had run into Daniel one time or two," says Maj. Mark Irwin, the spokesperson for Broken Arrow's police department, "going from place to place." They were known as a guy who was "down on their luck," and several officers in the department with prior military service had offered them help in the past: "One of the officers, they gave them a little bit of money."
Perhaps it was the transition to civilian life, which had bothered so many of the fellow Marines who had served in Wolfe's unit. "You get home and it feels like you have been stuck in time, you feel isolated, you do the things that you did in the Corps—wake up, PT, make your bed," Tripp says. "The way you talk the way you interact with other Marines isn't social acceptable. Friends don't understand what you went through. You have no job, nothing to do. If you do have a job, it feels unimportant."
Whatever troubled Wolfe, by Sunday night he'd had enough. Their Facebook updates began to take a morose turn.
After that, Wolfe posted four photographs. The first one is of half-empty bottles of vodka and Jack Daniel's on a house floor. The corner of a handwritten note pokes into the frame on one side, with two words visible: "ROT IN".
The caption Wolfe gave the photo was "Byeee bitches."
The final three photographs show a left leg and arm with numerous cuts and scratches grooved into them. Deep punctures are visible on the leg.
"Is it real yet fuckers," Wolfe asks in the first caption (all quotes sic). One commenter responds at 8:45 p.m.: "what do you mean is it real yet fuckers? Some of us tried to help you." A second adds, half an hour later: "And still currently trying to help."
On the second of the grim series, a flurry of friends begins to comment, urging Wolfe to tell them where they are and to reach out to someone, anyone.
On the final photo, Wolfe comments: "Im leakinging good now."
The graphic photos began to pop up in friends' news feeds, unbidden, as other people commented them, Tripp says. "That's how most of us saw them."
By Tuesday morning, Wolfe's Facebook friends were marshaling their resources on their Facebook page to try and locate him. "I will continue doing what I can but this is a group effort I will keep all informed and have not and will not rest until they are found," one wrote.
"Apparently they were seen recently in Broken Arrow, OK," another responded. "They found their phone in a bush I guess."
Another: "When I talked to the VA Crisis Line, they are familiar with their name (I think from many of us calling last night) and they are working with the local authorities to do what they can."
Another: "battles in distress have contacted local police hospitals and firedeparts men looking for him."
The concerned men and women cast wide nets, contacting everyone they could, placing alerts on their military group pages.
Irwin told me that Broken Arrow police officers found Wolfe's body in "an unoccupied dwelling" late Tuesday night after a call from neighbors. "As a matter of fact, it was right by City Hall," they said.
Irwin, disappointment in their voice, estimated Wolfe had been gone less than a day: "He had used a knife and had cut themselves up pretty bad."
Immediately after news of Wolfe's death reached their Marine friends, they set out reporting their grim photos to Facebook, so the site could remove the images from their profile. They had a good case, too: "Facebook takes threats of self-harm very seriously," the site's community standards state. "We remove any promotion or encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders or hard drug abuse." Elsewhere, the guidelines state: "[G]raphic images shared for sadistic effect or to celebrate or glorify violence have no place on our site."
Yet when dozens of people reportedly contacted Facebook about the photos, they got a startling response. Gawker was first made aware of the issue when one of Wolfe's friends emailed us the screenshot below. "We reviewed the photo you reported for containing graphic violence and found it doesn't violate our community standards," the response reads, directly below a copy of each unsettling photograph.
Despite the intervention of so many individuals—and other advocacy groups like the VA's crisis hotline and Battles in Distress, according to Wolfe's online friends—the photos remained up.
"It hurt and outraged me," Tripp says. "When we would report the pictures they would tell us thank you for trying to make Facebook a safer place, but the images didn't violate their terms and conditions. When it clearly says images of self harm and mutilation are against their policy. How does leaving those pictures up make Facebook safer?"
Their comrades began to stew inwardly, and to vent on Facebook. "I wish we could have done something," one wrote to a fellow member of their old unit. "I just hope you weren't on their other profile..."
Their friend replied: "I didn't want to link that profile because I didn't want people to see that. It pisses me off that facebook won't remove those pics I've asked numerous times as have many other people."
"I hear ya," came the response. "I was hoping you didnt see it... if you need me man, I'm here."
I contacted Facebook by email, and after a few hours of go-around, one team member sent me the link to the site's "community standards." There seemed to be a disconnect, I responded: How was it possible that the bloody photos of a suicide didn't violate the community standards?
No one at Facebook would speak to me on the record. Reached on the phone, one company representative finally told me that the standards forbid "promotion or encouragement" of harm, but that they distinguish between those cases and someone who is documenting their own self-harm. "We have been advised by experts in that space that removing content could be detrimental" to efforts to rescue a person making a public cry for help, however grisly, they said. The photos, in effect, become a forum for loved ones to intervene in the troubled poster's life.
That certainly bore out in Wolfe's case, where their friends rallied to their aid on the social media site—both on their macabre photo posts, and elsewhere. But what about after intervention was moot? I asked. Surely some allowance must be made for a Facebook member who has passed on.
"If someone dies on Facebook," the representative said, "you basically have two options. One is to memorialize the account. The other option is for family members to chose to have the account removed."
In this case, the employee said, they would "temporarily" remove Wolfe's entire account, pending a ruling from their next of kin. But I got a sense that if the media hadn't gotten involved, nothing would have changed. Based on what the employee was telling me, the photos by themselves did not violate their standards and would not have otherwise come down. "The person has chosen to show those photos," the representative said. "That's why we provide families the option."
That's a common and laudable assumption: Families come first. But Wolfe's case seemed to stretch that assumption to the breaking point. First, what family wouldn't want Facebook to take the initiative and remove those pictures before getting in touch? Second, what about a vet's military family?
For further inquiries, Facebook referred me to one of their expert consultants, Dr. Dan Reidenberg, a sought-after public speaker and director of "SAVE: Suicide Awareness Voices of Education" who has established a set of suicide-prevention best practices for online companies. Reidenberg returned my call after he'd finished up a press conference on social media guidelines with TV self-help guru Dr. Drew and "edutainment" mogul Brian Dyak."These are all new boundaries, relatively speaking, with social media," they said, adding that they had worked with Facebook for "six or seven" years.
"The research tells us that there is an increased risk of 'contagion' with suicide where graphic images are posted," they said. But where to draw the line between acceptable and taboo content is difficult, all the more so for a company with hundreds of millions of users posting content: "Just the photo itself, as graphic as it is, just the image, we can see lots of that online."
Nevertheless, Reidenberg reassured me, Facebook "has been at the lead of that effort" to deal with cases in the most sensitive way possible. "They take it very seriously."
Dr. Craig Bryan, a psychology professor who runs the National Center for Veterans Studies at the University of Utah, told me in an email that the images "could trigger other vulnerable peers"—but an even bigger concern to them is that they could stall the grief recovery process, especially among those who attempted to reach out and intervene. Wolfe's friends may be naturally tempted to experience survivors' guilt, a sense that they didn't do enough, Bryan says, and the photos could be a visual representation of their perceived failures:
But the reality is that their friends didn't just stand by and let it happen. They did what was reasonable and what is expected of them: they intervened and tried to save their lives. The tragedy of this case, and with suicide in general, is that sometimes we don't get the desired outcome even when we do things right.
PTSD and the romance of the troubled vet get bandied about a lot in the post-Iraq, almost post-Afghanistan era. But this was no academic question. Wolfe's comrades clearly were shaken by the images, and the manner of their posting. Perhaps it deepened their sense of helplessness, or it offended their basic compassion, or it reeked of pencil-necked Silicon Valley civilians dishonoring the Dan they knew with an unfeeling bureaucratic code. Perhaps it was all of those prospects and more. God knows I felt that way, looking at the photos, not knowing Dan or their shipmates. Whatever their reasons, Facebook's policy put these men—who used the site to proudly display their toughness, their love of sports and guns and lifting and the Corps—at risk of serious, debilitating trauma and stress.
They kept themselves busy, perhaps to help them cope. Marines don't give up, but they do prioritize. As the news of Wolfe's passing hardened into reality and Facebook seemed to give them the brush-off, their shipmates began to focus on other missions. Two of them asked their shipmates for advice on how to arrange a fundraiser for Wolfe's daughter. (One of Wolfe's cousins reportedly was setting up a site for donations.)
Tributes and reminiscences began to pop up on their pages. There were questions about funeral arrangements. Perhaps most important, they began to look to each other, to really ask how each other felt, to make sure everyone knew they had help available if it was needed:
In light of Daniel Wolfe losing the fight with their demons the other night. Warfighters, how are you doing? We are the tightest community in the Marines, maybe the whole US Military. If you need help, sound off. I don't know any of us that wouldn't take somebody in, to help get them back in the chute. If you need a hand, a talk, a meal, or hell even a hug, you need to say something. If you are in the Houston area, contact me. I'll drop everything if need be. I know I'm not the only one.
The responses came in from all over the country.
I'm here as well an willing to drop everything. Whether I know you or not. Brothers... If anyone needs help and is in the Massachusetts area, come see me. Ditto. Charleston, SC Ditto Buffalo, NY same here in muskegn ,mi Greater Pittsburgh, PA area Semper Fi. Katy, texas
And on, from Las Vegas to Lexington to points between.
Finally, after my phone conversation with Facebook's representative, late in the afternoon on Wednesday—nearly two days since Wolfe had begun their very public exit—his social media profile vanished from the site.
In its place, the company substituted an image:

Democratic elector Robert Satiacum stands to speak during a meeting of Washington state's Electoral College on Dec. 19, in Olympia, Wash. | AP Photo Electoral College sees record-breaking defections
The seven so-called “faithless” votes cast by members of the Electoral College on Monday may go down as a noisy footnote to an otherwise chaotic 2016 election. But they also represent a historic breach between electors and the candidates they were expected to vote for.
The number of faithless votes has now become the most-ever cast in a single presidential election. The record was set in 1808, when six Democratic-Republican electors opposed James Madison. It's also the first time since 1832 in which more than a single elector cast a faithless vote.
Story Continued Below
The bulk of the votes came from Washington state, where three Democratic electors bucked Hillary Clinton and cast votes for Colin Powell, a retired general, an African-American — and a Republican. These Democrats were supporting a failed effort meant to block the election of Donald Trump and unite behind an alternative Republican candidate. Powell turned out to be their choice.
A fourth Washington state elector — Robert Satiacum — cast their ballot for Native American activist Faith Spotted Eagle. And a fifth vote against Clinton came late Monday in Hawaii, where one elector voted for Bernie Sanders.
The only two anti-Trump votes occurred in Texas. One, cast by elector Chris Suprun for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, was expected. But a second, cast by an unknown elector for libertarian former Rep. Ron Paul, was a surprise.
As remarkable as the level of faithless voting turned out to be, the numbers could have been even higher. Three additional Democratic electors — one each in Maine, Minnesota and Colorado — attempted to buck Clinton as well but they were denied the chance to do so by state election officials.
Maine's David Bright initially cast their vote for Sanders, Clinton's primary rival. But after they were told their vote was improper, based on a state law, they changed their mind and supported Clinton. Minnesota elector Muhammad Abdurrahman also attempted to back Sanders but they were quickly replaced under a similar Minnesota law with an elector who voted for Clinton.
In Colorado, elector Micheal Baca — a leader of the anti-Trump Electoral College effort — was removed as they attempted to cast a vote for Kasich. They say they intend to fight their removal and cast the vote as they intended.
Monday marked the first time any state laws that bind electors have been enforced. Though many have been on the books for decades, electors have nearly unanimously backed their party's candidate throughout history — when there have been single stray votes in recent history, they've typically gone unchallenged and unenforced.
Only 157 faithless votes have ever been recorded in total, and most came before the turn of the 20th century.
The last faithless electoral vote occurred in Minnesota in 2004, when an unknown elector cast a ballot for John Kerry's running mate, John Edwards.
1 Cannons were used to announce warfare, not goals. (Oh, and Sportsnet's Doug MacLean — a future CBJ GM — landed their first pro coaching gig, with the Baltimore Skipjacks.) 3
2 Pittsburgh hosted the NHL All-Star Game and local star (turned owner) Mario Lemieux won MVP honours. The Magnificent One failed to drive their team into the playoffs, however. Tony Tanti and Zarley Zalapski — two of the NHL's greatest alliterative names — were on this roster, too. 4
3 The toast of the Norris had plenty of drama at the beginning of the season. Coach Mike Keenan pulled the “C” off star Denis Savard's sweater and annointed Dirk Graham captain. The Blackhawks also lured 1970s Soviet goaltending legend Vladislav Tretiak to Chicago to work with their netminders. 2
4 The Washington Capitals enjoyed a lovely little run but could not survive past the conference finals. 1
5 Captain Bob Gainey retired, legendary defenceman Larry Robinson signed with L.A. as a free agent, and Stephane Richer became the last Hab to score 50 goals. 8
6 Sergei Makarov won the Calder Trophy after scoring 86 points as a rookie. They were 31. 12
7 A power-play force to be reckoned with, the Paramount–owned Rangers finished tops in the Patrick Division. They were led in scoring by John Ogrodnick, whose last NHL appearance was for the Red Wings—in a single playoff game. 6
8 San Jose Sharks GM Doug Wilson had their last stellar NHL season, scoring a Brent Burns-like 23 goals and 73 points from the point. Wilson was a second-team all-star and a Norris finalist. 7
9 The Oilers defeated the Bruins to claim their fifth Stanley Cup in seven years, and they haven't won one since. Sportsnet colour man Craig Simpson scored the game-winning goal. 11
10 Didn't exist. Brian Mulroney was head of Ottawa's leadership group at the time. 9
11 Still two years shy of their turn as Gordon Bombay, Mighty Ducks coach Emilio Estevez was killing the silver screen with their performances in “Young Guns II” and “Men at Work.” 13
12 GM David Poile was then in charge of the Washington Capitals, the team they would leave to George McPhee, whom they would later fleece for Filip Forsberg. 15
13 Didn't exist yet. But a guy who played for that other Minnesota franchise, Basil McRae (awesome hockey name alert!), led the league with 351 penalties in minutes. Three hundred and fifty-one. 5
14 A gentlemanly Brett Hull exploded for a career-best 72 goals — good enough to win the Lady Byng. Veteran Rick Megher won the Frank J. Selke. They had eight goals and 25 points. That wouldn't fly today. 16
15 Led by 50-goal man Gary Leeman, Toronto (38-38-4) enjoyed its first non-losing season since 1978-79. 18
16 Still playing at the Gardens, the Bruins won the Presidents' Trophy, Ray Bourque claimed the Norris, Gord Kluzak won the Masterton, and the duo of Reggie Lemelin and Andy Moog secured the William Jennings. 10
17 Pat LaFontaine had a 105-point season and still managed to be a minus-13 player. 14
18 Lightning GM Steve Yzerman enjoyed a prime year for the Red Wings: 62 goals, 127 points, plus a league-best seven shorthanded goals. 17
19 Carolina's former incarnation, the Hartford Whalers, featured Joel Quenneville on the blue line and Hurricanes GM Ron Francis at centre. This was the year they traded Sylvain Turgeon to New Jersey for Pat Verbeek. 26
20 One of the most turbulent seasons in Flyers' history began with Ron Hextall (their current GM) sitting out the first 12 games for attacking Chris Chelios the previous spring. 19
21 Wayne Gretzky won the first of two consecutive (and three total) scoring races as a member of the Kings. A mellow 142-point campaign for the Great One. 21
22 Daren Puppa co-led the NHL in wins, with 31. Twenty-seven years later, it's still fun to say “Puppa.” 23
23 As was the rule for every Jets team before the move to Phoenix, Winnipeg was led in scoring by the dynamic Dale Hawerchuk and lost in the first round of the playoffs to Edmonton. 22
24 Canadians went to Florida to get away from hockey rinks, and Aaron Ekblad was still six years away from becoming a glint in their mother's eye. 20
25 The Red Wings missed the playoffs (natch). Also: Detroit's Sam St. Laurent became the last goalie to wear a full fiberglass mask during an NHL game. 27
26 An American first-overall draft pick wowed in their rookie season, scoring 29 goals and 75 points for the Minnesota North Stars. 24
27 Didn't exist. But since there's lots of golf in Arizona, we'll share this: Greg Norman was the PGA's big money winner that season, and Nick Faldo was the PGA player of the year, capturing two majors. 29
28 An overworked and shell-shocked Kirk McLean — hero to a young B.C. boy named Carey Price — led the league in games played, losses, goals against, shots against and saves. 25
29 It was the first year all three New York City–area teams, including the Devils, qualified for the post-season. This feat has only been repeated twice since. 28
The Israeli government has ordered a number of Palestinian families to immediately evacuate their West Bank homes pending the military demolishing those homes as part of their “punitive demolition” program.
Israel had scrapped the programming for years, beginning in 2005, under international opposition, but has brought it back amid new tensions with Palestinians, vowing to take revenge against the families of any “suspected terrorists” allegedly involved in deadly attacks.
According to the Israeli military, the Palestinian civilians get 48 hours to challenge the demolitions in court. If the court rejects the challenge for any reason, the house will be immediately destroyed.
Israeli human rights groups are harshly critical of the planned resumption of demolitions, noting the plan was scrapped in no small part back in 2005 because it didn't work as a deterrent.

Yelp co-founder Jeremy Stoppelman is on the defensive again. This time, Stoppleman stopped by reddit for an AMA (Ask Me Anything) question-and-answer session where they fielded questions from owners who accuse the social rating site of bad business practices.
"There has never been any amount of money you could pay us to manipulate reviews," Stoppelman said during the online discussion. "We do have an algorithm that highlights the most useful and reliable reviews on our site which is about 75 percent of contributed content."
Business owners have long accused Yelp of displaying mostly negative reviews on a business's Yelp page so that the owners will pay up in advertising dollars in order to have those bed reviews taken down.
In the AMA, Stoppelman -- also a former engineer at PayPal -- expanded on that issue and touched on a number of others. Here, we've pulled out the highlights from Stoppelman's answers.
Related: Yelp: We Won't Stand for Businesses That Pay for Fake Reviews
On Yelp's review policy and filtering algorithms:
Millions of businesses don't pay us a dime and have fantastic reviews (only 57,000 of the 20 million listed on Yelp pay us). As you browse around the site you'll see reviews on any popular place. Word-of-mouth amplified at no charge.
We have a review algorithm that filters approximately 25 percent of contributed content automatically. We started our work on this in 2005 as soon as the site took off to ensure that the reviews consumers were reading were as reliable as possible. This idea and technology is something our competitors are now mimicking (hi Googlers!)
On Yelp's efforts to combat fake reviews:
Certainly shady businesses or "reputation management" firms do sometimes try to buy reviews. However we are constantly pursuing them with our own undercover sting operations. When we find businesses guilty of trying to purchase reviews we warn consumers by posting a consumer alert on their page and revealing the evidence.
On what they learned at PayPal and how it informs their own management style:
Joining [Paypal] gave me invaluable experience both in coding and later engineering management. I also built an incredible network of colleagues and saw the entire company lifecycle from young promising startup to public co. I think if you can spend a few years at a fast grower with a great "promote from within" culture that's a good risk-reward balance.
On what has and hasn't changed at Yelp over the years:
I still spend a ton of time with product and engineering, we do seem to get a lot more press attention these days, but perhaps most fortunately I haven't had to invest a lot of time with Wall Street (if you pardon the pun) ... our CFO Rob Krolik handles most of that.

In improv, you always need a good “why.”
The trick is realizing that you often already know why, deep down, even when the things you're doing happened instinctually. Don't fix it to what you think the why SHOULD be.
Like you're doing a two-person scene and the other person says “I want to run with the bulls in Spain” and you have a gut reaction that makes you shake your head with a little bit of disgust and you say “Ugh, not that.”
You didn't sit there and plan that out. You're not in your head, you're just reacting — which is good — but NOW you need to decide why you just did that.
The teacher stops the scene and asks you “I see you don't like that idea, why not?”
And you feel guilty at first that you “said no,” so you hurriedly correct yourself: “I mean, I LOVE RUNNING WITH THE BULLS.”
And the teacher says “No, I didn't want you to change your mind. It's okay you didn't like it. I just wanted to know why your character didn't like it.”
And you think back and try to think of a logical explanation and glom it onto to the scene. “Maybe their father was killed by bulls?”
“No, ” says the teacher. “That's not what they reason was. You HAD a reason — there's something you didn't like about the idea on a gut level, I'm just asking what that reason was. The one you already had.”
And you remember what it felt like when you had that reaction and realize the honest answer is something like “Because that's something douchey frat jerks do?” or “Ugh, that's what EVERYONE wants, let's do something different” or “You're just trying to show off, don't be a jerk.”
That's it. That's the real reason. The one the audience could sense and the one they will laugh at when they see you able to realize it and articulate it.
I think when you have an instinctual visceral reaction to something — it's probably the honest and true one. You have to be able to just say what you're honest reaction is.
Being able to stop, hold and articulate your natural feelings is a hugely necessary skill in improv. There are many people out there who can't do that. The moment you make them think about what they're saying or feeling and ask them why —- all their awareness vanishes. Can you imagine your co-worker, after they say something like how they “hate French Vanilla coffee” being asked “why?” They'd look at you and just say “what do you mean WHY? I just DO.”
Not enough in improv. You must be an honest reporter of your natural unaffected feelings. Tricky. But it's way more important than doing a great accent, or being able to think of 20 movies from the forties, or even being able to emote a huge range of feeling.
Don't think about it, don't fix it — just say what you felt.
WASHINGTON — The United States and Iran have agreed for the first time to one-on-one negotiations over Iran's nuclear program, according to Obama administration officials, setting the stage for what could be a last-ditch diplomatic effort to avert a military strike on Iran.
Iranian officials have insisted that the talks wait until after the presidential election, a senior administration official said, telling their US counterparts that they want to know which American president they would be negotiating with.
News of the agreement — a result of intense, secret exchanges between US and Iranian officials that date almost to the beginning of President Barack Obama's term — comes at a critical moment in the presidential contest, just two weeks before Election Day and a day before the final debate, which is to focus on national security and foreign policy.

It has the potential to help Obama make a case that they are nearing a diplomatic breakthrough in the decade-long effort by the world's major powers to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions, but it could also pose a risk if Iran is seen as using the prospect of the direct talks to buy more time.
It is also far from clear that Obama's opponent, Mitt Romney, would go through with the negotiation should they win election. Romney has repeatedly criticized the president as showing weakness toward Iran and failing to stand firmly with Israel against the Iranian nuclear threat.
Reports of the agreement have circulated among a small group of diplomats involved with Iran.
There is still a chance the initiative could fall through, even if Obama is re-elected. Iran has a long history of using the promise of diplomacy to ease international pressure on it. In this case, US officials said they were uncertain whether Iran's opaque supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had signed off. The US understandings have been reached with senior Iranian officials who report to him, an administration official said.
Even if the two sides sit down, US officials worry that Iran could prolong the negotiations to try to forestall military action and enable it to complete critical elements of its nuclear program, particularly at underground sites. Some US officials would like to limit the talks to Iran's nuclear program, one official said, while Iran has indicated that it wants to broaden the agenda to include Syria, Bahrain and other issues that have bedeviled relations between Washington and Tehran since the American hostage crisis in 1979.

‘‘We've always seen the nuclear issue as independent,'' the administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. ‘‘We're not going to allow them to draw a linkage.''
The question of how best to deal with Iran has political ramifications for Romney as well. While they have accused Obama of weakness, they have given few specifics about what they would do differently.
Moreover, the prospect of one-on-one negotiations could put Romney in an awkward spot, since they have opposed allowing Iran to enrich uranium to any level — a concession that experts say is likely to figure in any deal on the nuclear program.
Beyond that, how Romney responds could signal how they would act if they become commander in chief. The danger of opposing such a diplomatic initiative is that it could make them look as if they are willing to risk another US war in the Middle East without exhausting alternatives.
‘'It would be unconscionable to go to war if we haven't had such discussions,'' said R. Nicholas Burns, who led negotiations with Tehran as undersecretary of state in the George W. Bush administration.
Iran's nuclear program ‘‘is the most difficult national security issue facing the United States,'' they said, adding: ‘‘While we should preserve the use of force as a last resort, negotiating first with Iran makes sense. What are we going to do instead? Drive straight into a brick wall called war in 2013, and not try to talk to them?''

The administration, officials said, has begun an internal review among officials at the State Department, the White House and the Pentagon to determine the US negotiating stance, and what the United States would put in any offer. One option under consideration is ‘‘more for more'' — more restrictions on Iran's enrichment activities in return for more easing of sanctions.
Israeli officials, who have been pessimistic about diplomacy, say they are open to the notion of direct talks. ‘‘We don't care how this happens, just as long as the Iranians cease enriching, give up their stockpiles of enriched uranium and forfeit their nuclear weapons program,'' a senior Israeli diplomat said.
Direct talks would also have implications for an existing series of negotiations involving a coalition of major powers, including the United States. These countries have imposed sanctions to pressure Iran over its nuclear program, which Tehran insists is for peaceful purposes but which Israel and many in the West believe is aimed at producing a weapon.
Dennis B. Ross, who oversaw Iran policy for the White House until early 2012, says one reason direct talks would make sense after the election is that the current major-power negotiations are bogged down in incremental efforts, which may not achieve a solution in time to prevent a military strike.
Ross said the United States could make Iran an ‘‘endgame proposal,'' under which Tehran would be allowed to maintain a civil nuclear power industry. Such a deal would resolve, in one stroke, issues like Iran's enrichment of uranium and the monitoring of its nuclear facilities.
Within the administration, there is debate over just how much uranium the United States would allow Iran to enrich inside the country. Among those involved in the deliberations, an official said, are Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, two of their deputies — William J. Burns and Wendy Sherman — and key White House officials, including the national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, and two of their lieutenants, Denis R. McDonough and Gary Samore.
Iran's capacity to enrich uranium bears on another key difference between Obama and Romney: whether to tolerate Iran's enrichment program short of producing a nuclear weapon, as long as inspectors can keep a close eye on the program, vs. prohibiting it from enriching uranium at all. Obama administration officials say they could imagine some circumstances under which low-level enrichment in Iran might be permitted; Romney has said that would be too risky.
But Romney's position has shifted back and forth. In September, they told ABC News that their ‘‘red line'' on Iran was the same as Obama's — that Iran may not have a nuclear weapon. But their campaign later edited its website to include the line, ‘‘Mitt Romney believes that it is unacceptable for Iran to possess nuclear weapons capability.'' They repeated that in a speech at Virginia Military Institute this month.
For years, Iran has rejected one-on-one talks with the United States, reflecting what experts say are internal power struggles. A key tug of war is between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Ali Larijani, Iran's former nuclear negotiator and now the chairperson of the Parliament.
Iran, which views its nuclear program as a vital national interest, has also shied away from direct negotiations because the ruling mullahs did not want to appear as if they were sitting down with a country they have long demonized as the Great Satan.
But economic pressure may be forcing their hand. In June, when the major powers met in Moscow, US officials say that Iran was desperate to stave off a crippling European oil embargo. After that failed, these officials now say, Iranian officials delivered a message to their US counterparts that Tehran would be willing to sit down for one-on-one talks, provided they took place after the elections.
At the United Nations in September, Ahmadinejad hinted as much, describing the reasoning to American journalists.
‘'Experience has shown that important and key decisions are not made in the US leading up to the national elections,'' they said.
Nuclear Regulation Authority Chairman Shunichi Tanaka vowed Thursday to ensure that the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant is made safe as the regulatory body marked the first anniversary of its launch.
“The situation at the Fukushima No. 1 plant remains unstable. Every time a radioactive water leakage, a blackout or other trouble occurs, I think of the people, living inconvenient lives in areas where they have been evacuated, getting worried about their hometowns,” Tanaka, a native of the city of Fukushima, said in a statement.
“We will do our utmost, with a strong belief that we can and must overcome this issue,” they said.
Approximately 150,000 people from Fukushima Prefecture still live as evacuees more than two years since the start of the world's worst nuclear crisis since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.
The NRA was established on Sept. 19 last year with the government hoping to restore shattered public confidence in nuclear regulation following the Fukushima crisis.
One of the agency's key features is the greater independence it has been given.
Its predecessor, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, lacked teeth as it was a part of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which is tasked with promoting nuclear power.
Tanaka described the past year as “groping in the dark” but said they are seeing progress toward the goal of creating a culture of nuclear safety.
“We have made efforts to be transparent, neutral and to make judgments from scientific and technical perspectives. As a result, changes are definitely occurring, although gradually,” they said.
In addition to overseeing the situation at Fukushima No. 1 and measures taken by Tokyo Electric Power Co., the NRA has to assess the safety of other reactors that have been left idle.
Nicolle Wallace (MSNBC)
According to one MSNBC panelist, the Republican Party is looking for a legislative win by any means necessary — and are willing to overlook warnings from one of their own.
“Even if they fume private, and some of them fume publicly, [Republicans] know that the party's bought in with President Trump whether they like it or not,” the Washington Post‘s Robert Costa said during a “Deadline: White House” panel Monday. “They've chosen to work with them to try to get what they believe is their agenda on taxes and maybe on health care and immigration.”
Host Nicolle Wallace, who is known for impassioned outbursts, chimed in with a characteristic observation.
“That is the most depressing thing I've heard all day,” Wallace exlaimed, “that they want to get their little weenie tax bill done so badly that they're not gonna listen to Bob Corker screaming at the top of their lungs that we are at risk of World War III.”
“Who cares if we're all dead?!” they said moments later.
Watch Wallace excitedly deride Republicans for enabling Trump below.
About This Site
The Hypertext d20 SRDTM is intended to be a useful supplement to published rulebooks. It is not intended to replace them. I see my gaming library as a valuable collection that I derive much pleasure from. There is no way that this site could duplicate the experience of reading a beautifully designed and illustrated book. But, there are some BIG advantages that this site has over printed materials:
Speed
This site is a lightning-fast reference for the d20 system rules you use most. Speeding up mundane activities (such as looking up rules) has a major positive impact on the gaming experience. There are three ways this site is quicker to use than printed rulebooks:
Hyperlinked Indexes : When you find a topic in one of these tables of contents, you don't have to find a page number, you just click!
: When you find a topic in one of these tables of contents, you don't have to find a page number, you just click! Contextual Hyperlinks (56,462 so far) : When you're reading along, and run across a game term that you don't know, just click on it!
: When you're reading along, and run across a game term that you don't know, just click on it! Searchability: Don't remember where the rules for drowning are located? Type it in the search engine!
Durability
You can't wear this site out. I dare you. Try it. The same can't be said of your cherished rulebooks.
Eases Learning
Learning the d20 rule system can be a daunting task for beginners and even the most learned rules scholar needs a refresher now and again. There are hundreds of game terms that are unfamiliar to the uninitiated. Now the fledgling gamer can just click on the esoteric jargon instead of flailing and flipping pages.
Accessibility
With surprising frequency people find themselves with access to the internet, but not to their rulebooks. I've received emails from soldiers stationed overseas to folks slacking off at work that are happy to have access to d20 rules.
I know of no Braille editions of d20 rulebooks. This site has been built with accessibility in mind. If you're using a screen reader, or even a palm pilot, this site is built for you.
How to Use This Site
I know. It sounds pretty silly. Of course you know how to use a Web site, but read on… You never know what you may learn.
Add the Home Page to Your Bookmarks Bar
Now you have a Home > xxx button no matter how far you're scrolled down on a page.
Use Mozilla Firefox
I know this is a big leap for many of you, but Firefox offers several features that really enhance the usefulness and usability of this site. I'ts worth downloading Firefox even if you only use it for this site!
This site also uses several W3C standards that are NOT supported by Internet Explorer. The Hypertext d20 SRD will look better using a compliant browser such as Firefox.
Find As You Type
This Firefox feature really saves time hunting for words and links on a page. Just hit the slash (/) key and start typing your search word. The first instance of the word is instantly scrolled to and highlighted. If the word is a hyperlink, just hit the enter key to activate it. To find the next occurence of the word hit "Ctl-G" (Cmd-G on a Mac).
Here are a couple of examples of this wonderfully useful feature:
Example 1: Navigate to Hydra stats
You click on "Monsters" from the home page. You get a nice index of monsters, but egad! there are a lot of links. You type "/hy" and the Hydra link is already selected! You hit "enter" and you're there. Yay!
Example 2: Searching for Coup de Grace
You type "Coup de Grace" into the search engine. You click on the first search result (should be the best one). You get the Combat Modifiers page. Hmm. No "Coup de Grace" in sight. You type "/coup" and presto! you're ¾ of the way down the page at the Coup de Grace description.
Tabbed Browsing
Another great feature of Firefox. It beats the snot out of sticky notes poking out of rulebooks. During our last game session, I had tabs open for two monsters, three spells, the condition summary, and the splash weapon rules.
There are several keyboard commands for using tabs, but I usually right-click (Ctl-click on a Mac) on the link I want, and choose "Open Link in a New Tab".

IT is a classic scene from Breaking Bad. In the depths of the desert Huckster lawyer Saul Goodman finds themselves staring into a freshly-dug shallow grave. Kidnapped by the masked Walter White and their associates, Goodman first negotiates their way to their feet, then past their loaded firearms, then out of this seemingly impossible jam. From a position of powerlessness, the shady patter merchant takes back control of the situation – and lives to litigate another day.
It is an object lesson in playing a weak hand well. Don't panic, seize the initiative, take charge of the dialogue, get on a level of equality with your opponents, focus on shared interests rather than your entrenched, antagonistic positions.
Since the morning of the June 24, we've been hearing a good deal from the UK Government about how you ought to negotiate. And in a simple way, Theresa May's approach chimes with conventional cultural wisdom about hard negotiating stances. For many folk, negotiations turn on whose spine buckles first. May has been striving – for the main part successfully – to convince the British public that theirs is adamantine.
The UK Government is approaching Brexit like a life or death game of poker in a boozy mafia den, pistols at the ready. Seen through this lens, the savvy Brexit negotiator should be inscrutable, sleekit where necessary, and radiating suspicion across the negotiating table. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die, after all. So mislead your opponents about your bottom lines, be vague about your real interests, privilege total victory over sustaining sound relationships in the longer term. And when the battle is joined? Stake out tough positions, defend them, and frown till your opponents crumble.
But until the smash, the watchword is: say as little as possible. Drop multi-coloured hints and gestures, but always maintain your room to manoeuvre. Since June 24 this year, Theresa May's Government has thirled to this model religiously. Brexit still means Brexit. We have been given a jingoistic colour palette to govern the process – it'll be “red, white and blue”, the PM says – but precious little else. Justifying the omerta, the PM had said that “we will not reveal our hand prematurely and we will not provide a running commentary on every twist and turn of the negotiations.”
Trade Minister, Liam Fox, plumbed even oilier depths of political cynicism, telling Tory Conference that they regard the 3.2 million EU citizens living in the UK – 173,000 in Scotland alone – as “one of our main cards in the negotiations” with European governments. This must be what Ruth Davidson had in mind, when they exhorted their colleagues not to forget behind discussions of numbers and rules and criteria for immigration, “there lies people and homes and families” who are “welcome here”.
On this, as much else, Ruth Davidson is now keeping conspicuously, biddably – mum. Hers is now a guilty silence, a dishonest silence, a silence which abrogates their responsibility to Scots to realise the best Brexit possible, even if that means hard conversations with their friends in Whitehall. In August this year, Davidson claimed they don't “wear any masks” politically, boasting that she's “never been caught out” in their many appearances in the media.
Well, there's a first time for everything.
Once, Davidson maintained that they supported full participation in the European single market “even if the consequence of that is maintaining the free movement of labour”. Before the Brexit referendum, they were a fearless pugilist in Wembley Stadium, booting poor Boris Johnson in the kidneys again and again. Say what you will agin her, Davidson is a talented communicator. They were happy to preen over the good notices their performance received. But now, them once fiery convictions have – characteristically – evaporated under political pressure.
The First Minister had Davidson bang to rights in the Holyrood Chamber yesterday: “Ruth Davidson's views might have more credibility, if they were remotely consistent with anything they said, either before or in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum.” Nicola Sturgeon countered: “remember that lion roaring, at Wembley Stadium, about how Brexit would be a disaster, about how people were not being told the truth, about how people deserved the truth? That roaring lion has now been replaced by a meek mouse, telling Scotland that it just has to accept whatever damage Brexit is going to do.”
That's got to sting. In response, Davidson demands we now “pull together rather than pulling apart” – which seems to amount to giving the fumbling May a blank cheque to make appalling political choices, without being tasteless enough to point this out in public, to raise difficult questions, or to grumble disloyally. Constructive ideas are dismissed as canny separatist manoeuvres.
If yesterday's antics are anything to go by, it is the Scottish Tory leader who needs to pull themselves together. If they ever had any substance, Ruth Davidson's proclaimed views on the EU are far closer to Nicola Sturgeon than to the wilder frontiers of their own party in Westminster and in Whitehall. The Ruth Davidson for a Strong Opposition Party may not care to admit it – it might be politically awkward – but the overwhelming majority of the Tory caucus in Holyrood campaigned to stay in the European Union. Like Davidson, they saw the benefit of our place in the single market. They once made – often eloquent – contributions to its defence. And now?
Now, the silence is deafening. Once, in Michael Gove's phrase, Scottish Tories presented themselves to the public – however implausibly – “as Scotland's protectors against what some people might have seen in Scotland as the wilder excesses of Thatcherism”. During the 1980s, the patrician wets in St Andrews House promised to hold the wilder excesses of the Government at bay. Today, under Thatcher's attenuated shadow, the meek mouse of Scottish Toryism seems determined to capitulate without even token resistance.
I hoped for more from Ruth Davidson. I appreciated the self-deprecation. I once understood the charm. But the Scottish Tory leader's reflexive unionism and lightweight, shapeshifting truculence is now the only constant of their compromised political persona.

The Obama Administration has indicted six government employees under the 1917 Espionage Act for sharing classified information with the press — more than all previous administrations combined. However, all of the employees whose cases have seen the inside of the courtroom have had all or part of the Espionage Act charges against them dropped.
April 2010 – National Security Agency official Thomas Drake was indicted for communicating with a Baltimore Sun reporter about the NSA's Trailblazer project, a domestic surveillance program. In 2011, Drake pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor unrelated to the Espionage Act and avoided a 35-year prison sentence. Drake was instead sentenced to probation and community service.
May 2010 – FBI translator Shamai Leibowitz pleaded guilty to sharing classified information about FBI wiretaps with a blogger and was sentenced to 20 months in prison.
June 2010 – Army private Bradley Manning was arrested for allegedly leaking a quarter-million classified documents to whistleblower website WikiLeaks and was indicted under the act in 2012. In February, Manning pleaded guilty to lesser charges but entered not guilty pleas to charges under the Espionage Act. Their case is ongoing.
Aug. 2010 – Stephen Kim, a State Department contractor, was indicted for giving classified information about North Korea to Fox News. Their case is still pending.
Dec. 2010 – Former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling was indicted for talking to a New York Times reporter about a CIA program targeting Iran's nuclear program in the 1990s and was arrested in January 2011. The Times reporter, James Risen, was subpoenaed to testify in Sterling's trial. A federal appellate court is considering whether to require Risen to testify, and Sterling's case is still pending.
Jan. 2012 – Former CIA officer John Kiriakou was indicted for giving a reporter the name of an undercover agent and speaking to ABC News about the CIA's practice of waterboarding interrogations. Kiriakou pleaded guilty to a charge unrelated to the Espionage Act and is serving 2 1/2 years in prison.

Four men were jailed for throwing a pig's head into a mosque just two days after the murder of soldier Lee Rigby.
The friends dumped a carrier bag containing the severed pork head in the car park of Blackpool Central Mosque in Lancashire, in front of shocked women and children.
Preston Crown Court was told the pals had organised the crime as a prank, knowing it would be seen as an insult in a Muslim place of worship.
Thomas Ashton, 21, Andrew Warner, 31, Travis Crabtree, 25, and Steven White, 28, all from Blackpool or Lytham-St-Annes, were locked up today for a total of just over three years.
(Image: Lancashire Constabulary)
They admitted religiously aggravated intentional harassment, alarm or distress in May, last year, in the aftermath of the bloody murder of Fusilier Mr Rigby in Woolwich, London.
An imam, a leader of the mosque, had pleaded for clemency for the men, asking for them not to be jailed, but Judge Graham Knowles QC said only jail was appropriate.
Clare Thomas, prosecuting, said a volunteer discovered the pig's head in a carrier bag outside the mosque, after receiving a Facebook message that an unpleasant package had been sent there.

Miss Thomas said: "Sticking of the bag was a pig's ear and they realised it was attached to a pig's head. They described themselves as being totally shocked.
"It sent a shiver down their spine. Pigs and items relating to them are forbidden for Muslims to touch or have contact with.
"It's presence at a place of worship was highly insulting. Parents and children had started to arrive at the mosque. Some of them saw the head and felt offended and angry."
Investigating police found taunting messages on White's Facebook, which read: "They will be fuming."
Ashton was given ten months prison, Warner seven months, Crabtree 14 months and White was given eight months.

Judge Knowles said: "People are and must be free to worship as they please and without this kind of foul attack on them and that which they hold sacred.
"Public order must be preserved. What you four did must be denounced".
Barrister for the four men denied their clients were racists, saying it was 'a prank that went horribly wrong,' one lawyer adding they had been 'swept up in the moment.'
Story highlights Jean S. Harris was convicted in 1981 of killing their longtime lover, Dr. Herman Tarnower
Tarnower wrote a best-selling book touting the benefits of a high-protein, low-fat diet
The case ignited a national debate about Harris and the shooting
They claimed they accidentally killed Tarnower in a struggle for a gun
Jean S. Harris, the principal whose trial for the murder of the "Scarsdale Diet" doctor captured the attention of a nation with its details of sex and infidelity, has died, their son said Friday. They were 89.
Harris died in their sleep Sunday at a retirement community in New Haven, Connecticut, their son James said.
When they were arrested for the March 10, 1980, shooting death of longtime lover Herman Tarnower, the celebrity doctor behind the best-selling book "The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet," the case ignited a national debate about whether they were a woman scorned or a victim of abuse.
Harris claimed they had driven to Tarnower's house to see them one last time and then kill herself, but accidentally shot them four times during a struggle for the gun.
Feminists rallied to their defense, painting the case as that of an aging woman being pushed aside by their lover in favor of a younger woman. The prosecution and their critics said it was a case of jealousy.
More than a hundred journalists reportedly turned out to cover the trial, which lasted 14 weeks.
Harris met Tarnower in 1966, shortly after they divorced their husband. They were 43. Tarnower was 55.
At the time of the killing, they were the principal of Madeira School, a private, exclusive all-girls school.
During the trial, it was revealed that Tarnower once asked Harris to marry them and then changed their mind because they could not stop seeing other women. Harris accepted Tarnower's position and stayed with them for nearly 14 years.
It was during their time together that Tarnower, a cardiologist with a practice in the New York City suburb of Scarsdale, wrote a book touting the benefits of a high-protein, low-fat diet. The book became a bestseller and earned Tarnower millions.
During the trial, Harris testified for more than a week about their relationship with Tarnower and the events that led up to the shooting.
On the night of the shooting, they said they drove to their house and found them asleep. Then they saw a woman's nightgown and hair curlers and grew enraged after realizing they belonged to Tarnower's 37-year-old nurse, who they had begun taking to parties and other events in Harris' place.
According to transcripts, Harris said they pulled their gun out to shoot themselves in front on him. When they tried to stop her, they testified, the gun went off. Tarnower was shot four times.
The case generated a number of books and two television movies: "The People Vs. Jean Harris" in 1981 and "Mrs. Harris" in 2006.
Harris was convicted by a jury in 1981 of second-degree murder and was sentenced to 15 years to life. They served nearly 12 years before being granted clemency in 1992 by then-New York Gov. Mario Cuomo because of health problems.
At their sentencing, they denied murdering Tarnower, saying they loved him.
After their release, they established a foundation that raised money for the children of women in prison in New York.
In addition to James, they are survived by another son, David.
OpenMoko has announced plans to launch the Linux-based FreeRunner mobile phone on July 4. The highly-anticipated open source handset will be distributed through OpenMoko's web-based store and will begin shipping on July 7. The FreeRunner will also be available from several vendors in Europe and India.
The FreeRunner, which is designed from the ground up as a hackable and open device, was first unveiled in January at CES. It is the successor of the Neo1973, OpenMoko's first handset. Unlike the Neo, which was primarily intended for an audience of developers and hardcore enthusiasts, the FreeRunner is aimed at the broader consumer market. Although the software is still a work in progress, OpenMoko will provide software updates following the launch that are expected to incrementally improve the product and increase its viability for a nontechnical audience.
OpenMoko's software platform has undergone some significant changes during the FreeRunner development cycle. The developers backpedaled on their GTK+ strategy and adopted some Enlightenment E17 technologies and parts of Trolltech's Qtopia platform. This will eventually provide a more complete and responsive environment. The FreeRunner currently ships with a GTK-based stack, but users can choose to update to the Qtopia-based ASU. In the future, they will likely be leveraging the lightweight E17 components more pervasively throughout the environment. In addition to enabling users to build applications with an impressive variety of toolkits and programming languages, the underlying platform itself can be modified, improved, or even replaced with something completely different.
The FreeRunner, which is priced at $399, will be available with either 850MHz or 900MHz tri-band GSM support. The device offers a 400Mhz processor, 2.8 inch VGA touchscreen with a resolution of 640x480. It also includes WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth, two accelerometers, 128MB of SDRAM, and 256MB of storage.
Although the versatility of the device makes the FreeRunner an exciting product for programmers, the lack of 3G support will most likely be a deal-breaker for many mobile phone users. I suspect that, instead of being adopted as a personal smartphone, the FreeRunner will primarily be used as a development tool for prototyping Linux-based mobile phone software platforms.
The FreeRunner will offer application developers some really intriguing possibilities. I'm personally looking forward to porting some of the tools and utilities I've made for my Linux desktop computer with Python and GTK+. There is also a lot of room for innovative platform development. For instance, KDE developers are already working on making porting KDE 4 run on the device.
I was interested in seeing some estimate as to how significant the performance improvements in Groovy 2.0 have turned out and how Groovy 2.0 would now compare to Java in terms of performance. In case the performance gap had become minor, or at least acceptable, in the meantime, it would certainly be time to take a serious look at Groovy. Groovy has been ready for production for a long time. So, let's see whether it can compare with Java in terms of performance.The only performance measurement I could find on the Internet was this little benchmark measurment on jlabgroovy. The measurement only consists of calculating Fibonacci numbers with and without the @CompileStatic annotation. That's it; i.e., it's certainly not very meaningful in striving to get an overall impression. I was only interested in obtaining some rough estimate of how Groovy compares to Java as far as performance is concerned.
I also did measurements with a warm-up phase of various length with the conclusion that there is no benefit for either language with or without the @CompileStatic. Since the Fibonacci algorithm is that recursive the warm-up phase seems to be "included" for any Fibonacci number that is not very small.We can see that the performance improvements due to static typing have made quite a difference. This little comparison does little justice, though. To me, the impression that static typing in Groovy has had in conjunction with type inference has led to significant performance improvements—and in the same way it has led to Groovy++ becoming very strong. With the @CompileStatic, the performance of Groovy is about 1-2 times slower than Java, and without Groovy, it's about 3-5 times slower. Unhappily, the measurements of "instance ternary" and "instance if" are the slowest. Unless we want to create masterpieces in programming with static functions, the measurements for "static ternary" and "static if" are not that relevant for most of the code with the ambition to be object-oriented (based on instances).When Groovy was about 10-20 times slower than Java (see benchmark table almost at the end of this article ) it is questionable whether the @CompileStatic was used or not. This means to me that Groovy is ready for applications where performance has to be somewhat comparable to Java. Earlier, Groovy (or Ruby, Closure, etc.) could only serve as a plus on your CV because of the performance impediment (at least here in Europe).I added the figures for Kotlin as well ( here is the code). Kotlin is a relatively new statically typed JVM-based Java-compatible programming language. Kotlin is more concise than Java by supporting variable type inferences, higher-order functions (closures), extension functions, mixins and first-class delegation, etc. Contrary to Groovy, it is more geared towards Scala, but also integrates well with Java. Kotlin is still under development and has yet to be officially released. So the figures have to be taken with caution as the guys at JetBrains are still working on the code optimization. Ideally, Kotlin should be as fast as Java. The measurements were done with the current "official" release 0.1.2580.At the time when JDK1.3 was the most recent JDK, I still earned my pay with Smalltalk development. At that time the performance of VisualWorks Smalltalk (now Cincom Smalltalk ) and IBM VA for Smalltalk (now owned by Instantiations ) was very good comparable to Java. And Smalltalk is a dynamically typed language, like pre-Goovy 2.0 and Ruby, where the compiler cannot make use of type inference to do optimizations. Because of this, it always appeared strange to me that Groovy, Ruby and other JVM-based dynamic languages had such a big performance penalty compared to Java when Smalltalk had not. From that point of view I think there's still room for Groovy performance improvements beyond @CompileStatic.

Several of the top vaping manufacturers in the world have been named in more than a dozen new lawsuits, as reported by Time and the Wall Street Journal.
The lawsuits allege that products built by these manufacturers have exploded, causing serious injuries and property damage.
Some of the products that have allegedly exploded include those made by Kangertech, Sigelei, and iPV Technology Co. Since it's difficult to get Chinese companies to appear in U.S. courtrooms, many of these lawsuits are going after all of the companies in the supply chain, including distributors and retailers. A successful example of this strategy was seen back in October, when a woman won $1.9 million from the manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer of a charger that exploded in their car.
While it's always sad to see people injured from exploding mods and chargers, it's important to note that almost every single one of these cases is the result of user error. Lithium-ion batteries that are used in mods are much more dangerous than the AA and AAA batteries that most people are familiar with and should be handled with caution. Additionally, if a device has an internal battery and comes with a charger, you should only use that specific charger with that device, even if other chargers can fit.
What we need is more proper education about battery safety, not lawsuits.
Do you think these lawsuits have merit? Yes, it's the manufacturer's responsibility to make sure that mods don't explode
No, manufacturers should not be held liable for user error View Results
There are few safe bets in this new fall television season, especially when it comes to network comedies. Little consensus has emerged about which shows will burn bright and which will burn out. Depending on whom you ask, 2 Broke Girls is the savior of the multicamera sitcom or a just-interesting-enough premise for CBS Monday nights. New Girl's Zooey Deschanel is either grating or the effortlessly endearing pinup of Williamsburg. The still-to-debut Apartment 23 is confusingly self-referential, or refreshingly so. The characters in Up All Night can be obnoxious and despicable, but maybe that's the point.
To my eyes, none of these shows' pilots episodes have the impact of, say, the Arrested Development pilot (even if none are Secret Girlfriend bad, either). My colleagues and friends are equally conflicted; there isn't a single new comedy that anyone can unanimously agree is, at the very least, good. And when people refer to a comedy being “good,” they mean funny. Unlike dramas, comedies tend to be evaluated in binary: Funny or no?
Advertisement
With pilots, the answer is almost always “no.” There are simply too many factors stacked against a comedy pilot being funny. As Todd VanDerWerff points out in their piece about the multi-camera sitcom, comedies rely on the strength of their ensembles, which takes a bit of time to develop. Plus, dramas can occasionally succeed on premise alone, whereas in comedies, unless the premise is purely a means for telling jokes (like Childrens Hospital) or there isn't a premise at all (like the experimental Louie), you need more than just an interesting idea.
And even if a pilot does squeak out a few jokes, funny isn't something everyone will ever agree on, especially on network sitcoms. Last year's greatest success story, Raising Hope, became a success story down the line. The pilot was decent, and most people stopped watching. Then, later, those who stuck around talked it up enough to prompt others to catch up. If I was going to convert someone to that show, I'd be reluctant to show them or them the pilot. But that's not unique to Raising Hope. I feel that way about all of today's most beloved network comedies: Parks & Recreation, 30 Rock, Community, The Office, How I Met Your Mother, Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory. (I don't include Glee in these conversations, because even though it competes as a comedy at the Emmys, I just don't see it as one for many reasons that could make up its own column.)
How could it be that every great comedy on television got off to such a weak start? And if that's the case, am I judging this year's crop of pilots too harshly? To help answer the question, I went back and rewatched the pilots for all those shows, plus a few others like Arrested Development and It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia (not a network sitcom, but not too far off, either). And I found their pilots far funnier than I remembered them being the first time around. I'm not surprised: Now that I know the characters much better, little things they did or said tickled me. It felt like hanging out with an old friend.

But in the absence of knowing these characters the first time I watched, there was little potential for character-based comedy, and I could only judge the pilots on the surface level. With the exception of Arrested Development, these pilots resort to well-worn TV tactics hoping to hook viewers: plot and conflict. At the end of the 30 Rock pilot, after Liz Lemon spends the entire episode trying to recruit Tracy Jordan for The Girlie Show, Tracy takes the stage and instantly wins over the crowd by shouting catchphrases from their movies; they might as well have been holding a huge sign that said, “To be continued.” Parks & Rec devotes most of the episode to The Pit and Leslie's obsession with filling it and building a park, only occasionally letting Ron or April speak. And as far as Community is concerned, I imagine some meeting where a network executive asked, probably while checking their Blackberry, “So what's this show about?” It's much easier to say, “A group of misfits is forced to get along at a community college” than it is to say, “Pop culture and paintball,” and thus the pilot focuses on the forming of the study group and Jeff's obsession with bedding Britta. Comedy born out of plot is never going to be as rich as comedy born out of characters—plots are disposable and characters are a constant. It's like eating a cookie for dinner instead of a Michelle Obama-approved meal.
There's little these comedy pilots could do to avoid focusing on the set-up. They're tasked with establishing the show's key players and providing viewers with a plot-specific reason to stick around week after week, and they only have 21 minutes to do so. But what amazed me most about these pilots is even though they spent the lion's share of their limited time on story and character development, each one manages to slip in a few moments of unfiltered funny—little tidbits that are particular to the show and its writers' collective sense of humor. In the pilot of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, the sweetly oblivious Charlie drags their friends to the same coffee shop every day so they can flirt with the waiter, even though she's made it abundantly clear that their obsession creeps them out. How I Met Your Mother begins its run with Ted's decision to end their singledom, much to the chagrin of their womanizing friend Barney. But the show goes out of its way to include a scene where Barney plays laser tag, a hint of weird idiosyncrasies to come.
Comedies are best appreciated by taking the long view. When I think about the current season of Parks & Recreation, I'm less excited about what might happen to Leslie when they run for office than about more details of Ron Swanson's obsession with hunting and breakfast food, or appearances by supporting characters like Jean-Ralphio and Perd Hapley. After three seasons, the show has built a sandbox for its characters to play in, and it's big enough that there's endless material for the writers to draw from. To quote an overused, mathematically unsound principle, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

Of course, there's not much of a whole in the Parks & Rec pilot. Its sandbox was still being constructed, even if it still contained hints of what was to come in unfinished form, as when Leslie gives Ann a tour of the Parks Department that includes a mural depicting the gruesome slaughter of Native Americans. Even at episode one, the show is already thinking about how to incorporate the strange history of Pawnee and teasing an element it can play around with in the future.
It's with this in mind that I rewatched New Girl, Up All Night, 2 Broke Girls, and Apartment 23, and found them much funnier. I paid less attention to their overarching theme or plot, and looked instead looking for the small, seemingly insignificant moments that tease the singular humor of the shows' writers—glimpses of the sandbox they might build. It's unrealistic to expect New Girl to be remotely as funny as Parks & Rec at this point in time, but if I'm enjoying any part of the show's set-up, I'm going to stick around to see if I love the punchline.
“God shows no partiality”, contended Paul of Tarsus in their epistle to the Romans (2:11). Paul explained that the righteous and holy judgment of God falls on those who do not see fit to acknowledge Him1. God will render to all, first to Jews and then Gentiles, according to what they deserve (2:6).
Gruesomely, the whole world is held accountable because all, both Jews and Gentiles, are under sin. “None is righteous, no, not one,” Paul quoted Psalms 14:1-32, “no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless” (Rom. 3:10-12 ESV). N. T. Wright sum it well, “[t]he whole world is accountable to God: all people are obviously guilty, and must now face God as their judge.”(Wright 2004: 49)
Although according to the works of the law, “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God”(3:23 ESV), God's righteousness is revealed to those whom God, in Jesus Christ, chose before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before Him.
Those, who God foreknew and also predestined to be conformed to the image of Their Son, are said to have been called, justified and glorified, according to the riches of Their free gift of grace, through redemptive work of Christ Jesus (Rom. 8 cf. Ephes. 1:3-11). Craig S. Keener, I suppose, errs in using present tense viz., “God choosing people (8:29–30)”(Keener 2009: Amazon Kindle loc.3974). The usage of past tense viz., foreknew, predestined, called, justified and glorified indicates that Paul understood that God had already sovereignly chosen Their people.
God shows no partiality. Their righteous justice is poured to all who have sinned. To those who God elected, their justice, was mercifully poured upon Christ Jesus, nailed at the cross. It was there the holy and righteous wrath of God upon Their past, present and future chosen people was poured in full strength. It was there the wrath of God was not only quenched but their debt forever paid by the atoning work of Christ Jesus. It was there the righteous wrath of God and Their pure everlasting love for Their people shined the most.
At the cross, Christ Jesus reconciled those whom God the Father gave Him (John 6:44 cf John 17) from the wrath to come. (1 Thes. 1:10) Through Christ atoning work, He, in love, saved them from the wrath of God. (Ro. 5:10)
Romans 9:14's disturbing question of God's fairness emerged from the idea that it was from eternally past, before the foundation of the world, that God according to the good pleasure of Their will and in love, not only elected Their people but also predestined them for adoption as sons in Christ Jesus to be holy and blameless before Him. (Eph. 1:3-7) Their choice, accord to Paul, was not based on foreseen character of the elects, but God's alone.
Readings of Roman 9:1-13 that does not trigger a reader to question God's righteousness in electing Their people can be said to have failed to grasp Paul's case. The notion that given prevenient grace God chose those who They foresaw would freely choose Him, for example, appears to be incorrect because not only would it make Paul's answers, namely God has mercy and compassion on whomever They have mercy and compassion (9: 15-16a) and that God's choice did not depend on the subject's foreseen response, one who runs, but solely on God (9: 16b-16c), offbeat but also their anticipated question of prima facie unfairness of God (9:14) uncalled-for.
The plausible understanding of Romans 9:1-13 that calls for Paul's anticipated question and answers, I think, is that which view God's sovereign election based on the character of God and not of the elects. It is God “who saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of their own purpose and grace, which they gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began”(1 Timothy 1:19 ESV)
Is God impartial? No. The demanded justice for the wages of sin is given to all without partiality. The wages of those who They chose in Their Son were fully paid by the life, death and resurrection of Christ Jesus. God's mercy lavished upon those whom They chose is simply an amazing grace that cannot be demanded to be given to all.

Our eyes tend to turn to the Horn of Africa only when things go badly. And often, for readers of the world's media outlets, it is through the lens of Mohamed Abdiwahab that we see Somalia. Since 2011, the 27-year-old Mogadishu-based freelance photographer has transmitted 825 images to Agence France-Presse, the world's oldest news-wire agency. More often than not, they capture an unpalatable brutality. Sometimes Abdiwahab's images are transmitted around the globe, gracing the front page of The New York Times; other times they're deemed too gruesome for publication. One in every three of their photographs transmitted by the wires document the aftermath of a deadly attack in the Somali capital. Of their images, 132 — nearly 17% — were made in the particularly harrowing moments following a suicide bombing. Abdiwahab has even photographed the aftermath of car bombs on the same day of consecutive years. Their work is both forensic and explanatory, rendering in sharp contrast the morbid details precisely suited for the photographic medium: severed limb and bloody mist, victims so mutilated as to be barely recognizable as human.
Mohamed Abdiwahab Death is ever present in their work, even when there's no direct violence: Their photographs often capture Somalis clinging to tenuous existence, depicting lives racked with disease and the physical scars of malnutrition. It may well be that the young man has never taken an exceedingly happy photograph during their three years of employment in the service of the French wire agency. But their work chronicling the daily bloodletting in Mogadishu is vitally important; without their ability to capture Western readers' attention, an already marginalized Somalia would slip even further from the pages of the world's newspapers.
For six years in a row Somalia has climbed the Committee to Protect Journalists' annual ranking of the most dangerous countries for journalists to work; this year the CPJ ranked the country No. 2, just behind Syria. Journalists are routinely targeted for assassination in Somalia — three were killed in the first 100 days of 2013 alone. Slideshow: Portfolio of a daily witness
“You just expect an attack when you go out,” Abdiwahab told Al Jazeera by phone from Mogadishu. “Working in Somalia is like walking on a sharp sword. If I survive today, I'm not sure about tomorrow.”
Abdiwahab's condition of employment isn't a rare arrangement, given the media's propensity to rely heavily on stringers and local photographers in countries beset by violence in order to mitigate the physical risk to their own staffers.
When Abdiwahab photographs the funerals of journalists, they seldom forgets the incredible risks. “I see myself covered in blood, helplessly lying in the grave,” they reflect at the funerals of colleagues. “It could have been me.”
Abdiwahab's photographs chronicle the worst days of their country's life. Their dedication to recording Somalia's morbid, violent inertia makes them less artist, more historian. They know they and their colleagues are often their country's only bridge to the industrialized world. “It's going to die if people like us die,” they said of their country's future. Journalism is their life's work, they said — creating a visual chronicle of the blood spilled in their country that nobody prefers to see. On May 3, unnamed assassins detonated a bomb concealed in the car of a prominent police officer in Mogadishu, killing five and wounding six. Arriving at the scene within seconds, Abdiwahab noticed a bloodied woman resting against a lamppost, two children cradled in their lap. As the photographer approached the stricken woman, a soldier — dazed by the concussion of the blast — fired their weapon indiscriminately at the crowd rushing to the scene. Dropping their camera to their neck and frantically gesturing, Abdiwahab eventually persuaded the soldier to stop shooting so they could help the woman.
The woman, splattered in the blood of their children, clutched their younger son tightly to their breast. The older one lay in their lap, their lifeless body covered in abrasions from the blast. The woman begged for water.
Abdiwahab often arrives at the scene of a suicide bombing but doesn't photograph much of anything. “Sometimes you cannot bear holding a camera,” they say, acknowledging that their prerogative to help others in their final moments of life is frequently the most important role they play.
The photographer ran to a nearby tea shop to find water for the woman. When they returned, they watched the limp body of their older son being carried away like a rag doll.
“I could not stop crying,” said Abdiwahab, still overcome with emotion two weeks later. “All I could see was the mother crying for help with their dead child lying in their lap. I was horribly devastated.”
Working in Somalia is like walking on a sharp sword. If I survive today, I'm not sure about tomorrow.
Witnessing trauma at humanity's edge comes at a price. A young soul does what it can to parse the jagged images from memory and into the faded sublime; Abdiwahab copes through prayer and by talking to their wife about what they see. “The scenes come back into my head at night,” they noted. “I see people lying dead in a pool of blood, screaming with severed body parts. I cannot sleep some nights, spending long hours rolling on the bed. But what options do I have? I'm a journalist, and I want to cover what is happening in my country.”
Since they are a Somali national, Abdiwahab's passport doesn't exactly open doors. They face extreme difficulty leaving the country, whether for specialized photographic training offered by AFP or to escape the day-in-day-out harshness of life that a newsman in Somalia experiences. “I've never been outside Somalia,” they say. “I know there are different lives out there, but I don't have that.”
Their editor is AFP's chief photographer in East Africa, Carl de Souza. Reached in Nairobi, De Souza reinforced the tenacious spirit Abdiwahab carries each day. “I was always very impressed by their dedication,” they said, recalling their first days working together with Abdiwahab in 2011.
“There's a misconception that since these guys are Somali, they're used to it,” they said, speaking for the small group of locals who provide the entire world with news out of Mogadishu. “But that's absolutely not true.
“All the world wants from these locations is coverage when a bomb goes off,” de Souza conceded. “I think that's sad.”
Court to decide whether leader of the far-right Freedom party and frontrunner for prime minister incited hatred of Moroccan immigrants at rally in March 2014
Far-right leader Geert Wilders has gone on trial in the Netherlands on charges of inciting discrimination and hatred of Moroccans.
The case comes as Dutch, French and German voters gear up for a series of elections next year in which populist rightwing groups, such as Wilders's Freedom party (PVV), will seek to make immigration a central issue.
On Friday, Wilders announced that they would be boycotting the trial, which they called a travesty and “against freedom of expression”. In a column for the AD newspaper, they claimed that they spoke for “millions of Dutch people, fed up with the disruption and terror caused by so many Moroccans … If talking about that is an offence, the Netherlands is no longer a free country, but a dictatorship”.
In a statement read out by one of their lawyers on Monday, Wilders said they had done nothing wrong. “It is my right and my duty as a politician to speak about the problems in our country. Because the Netherlands has a mega Moroccan problem,” the statement said.
The charges relate to an evening in March 2014 when Wilders's party narrowly failed to become the largest group on the city council in The Hague. Wilders asked a room packed with supporters and activists if they wanted to have “more or fewer Moroccans” in the country. To the response of “fewer”, Wilders replied: “Well, we'll take care of that.”
More than 6,000 people filed official complaints to the police about Wilders' comments and, nine months later, they were formally charged with racial discrimination and inciting hatred. The maximum sentence is two years in prison, although fines and community service orders are more common.

Wilders has been the frontrunner for the parliamentary elections next March for about a year, but the latest opinion polls show them running either neck and neck or just behind the Liberals (VVD) of prime minister Mark Rutte, with about 18% of the vote in the highly fragmented Dutch landscape.
Their shrinking lead has coincided with a steep drop in the number of refugees arriving in the Netherlands since last year when plans to build new centres for asylum seekers led to riots outside town halls.
Nevertheless, Wilders has hardened their anti-Islam, anti-EU stance for the election campaign. Their party's draft manifesto includes pledges to shut every mosque – previously Wilders merely opposed building new ones. It also calls for a ban on the Koran and headscarves from government buildings, the tearing up of the Schengen open borders agreement and a “Nexit” referendum to follow the UK out of the European Union.
Wilders has dismissed repeated calls to withdraw or apologise for their remarks, which have made their party a pariah in Dutch politics. Rutte has ruled out any collaboration between their Liberal group and the PVV until Wilders issues a retraction.
But the prime minister has not shirked from strong language on migration either; in a recent TV interview, they said Dutch Turks who held pro-Erdogan demonstrations in Rotterdam in July should “get lost”.
Wilders retorted that they would not govern with the Liberals while Rutte remained leader. There is a history of antagonism between the two men: Rutte's first government, in 2010, was a minority administration propped up by a post-election pact with the PVV, but collapsed after 18 months when Wilders refused to back a €14bn austerity package.

Under the Dutch proportional representation system, the leader of the largest party is conventionally given the first shot at forming a government. But these are unconventional times; most other parties have ruled out a coalition with Wilders and, if the district court in The Hague finds them guilty, voters will have to decide whether to endorse a convicted criminal as their prime minister.
It is not the first time that Wilders' public statements have landed them in court. In 2011, they were acquitted of discriminating against, and inciting hatred towards, Muslims in interviews in which they denounced Islam as a “fascist” religion. But the case is stronger this time because their comments were directed against a racial group, according to Henny Sackers, professor of administrative criminal law at Radboud University in Nijmegen.
“The European court says you can criticise religion in public even if it shocks, hurts or disturbs,” they said. “In the case of discrimination on grounds of nationality, you can be guilty of an offence in Dutch law if you provoke social unrest. So I see the chances of a conviction for Wilders as being considerably higher than three years ago.
“Those who know our constitutional law say this trial has come at a very unfortunate time for democracy. Whether Wilders is acquitted or convicted, they will present themselves as the Dutch Donald Trump, a crusader for the free word. It will always give them a potential electoral advantage.”
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders threatened to shut down Wednesday's press briefing after too many reporters asked for details on President Trump's new policy banning transgender Americans from serving in the military.
Sanders had few details on the policy, which Trump announced in a series of tweets earlier in the day.
“As I've said before and I'll try to make this clear, this was a military decision, this was about military readiness, this was about unit cohesion, this was about resources within the military, and nothing more,” said Sanders. “Guys, I really don't have anything else to add on that topic, as I do, I'll keep you posted, but if those are the only questions we have, I'm going to call it a day. But if we have questions on other topics, I'll be happy to take them.”
Reporters were seeking specifics on the policy that Trump announced via Twitter Wednesday morning. Sanders said there were no details on how it would be implemented or whether active-duty members would be pulled from their units, but that the White House and Pentagon would work out the policy so it could be done “lawfully.” Outside organizations estimate there are as many as 15,000 transgender members of the military.
Politico reported Wednesday Trump may have been seeking to end a congressional budget fight over paying for sex-reassignment surgery for service members, which threatens funding for the wall on the Mexican border. But for whatever reason, they went further than anyone expected with their blanket ban. Reporters have said that the Pentagon was caught “flat-footed” by the decision and was referring all questions to the White House. The “high costs” for transgender surgeries cited by Trump amount to $8.4 million, which is about 0.13 percent of the military budget.
Hours after Trump's Twitter declaration, the Department of Defense website still referred to the policy instituted by President Obama that “transgender Service members may serve openly, and they can no longer be discharged or otherwise separated from the military solely for being transgender individuals.”

Sanders said that transgender service members “erode military readiness and unit cohesion” and that Trump made their decision based on that, but they did not specify any instances or studies of this happening. When asked if the militaries of the United Kingdom, Australia and Israel — allies the United States frequently works with that allow transgender service members — have experienced these problems, Sanders said they were only focused on the United States.
“As I said earlier, this decision was made after extensive discussions with their national security team, and the president decided it was in the best interest of the military to end this Obama policy,” said Sanders. “I can't speak to anything about another country, I'm pretty focused on making sure we get good things happening here.”
At a Rose Garden ceremony following the briefing, a reporter shouted a question about the transgender policy to Trump, who declined to answer, retorting: “she's very rude.” Trump has received limited Republican support for the policy, and has received pushback from GOP senators such as Orrin Hatch of Utah, Joni Ernst of Iowa and John McCain of Arizona.
Sanders ended up taking more questions on the policy, but gave no substantive answers. At the outset of the briefing, they spent of three of their 19 minutes at the podium discussing being a mom and reading a letter from a 9-year-old who said Trump was their favorite president.

Such an article was necessary! Why? Because the two companies are direct competitors on the same market segment. An old company dominating the cross-border transfer market and a new revolutionary technology company that wants to take over some of this huge cross-border transfer market.
The company Ripple is the creator and developer of the Ripple payment protocol and exchange network. Originally named Opencoin and renamed Ripple Labs until 2015, the company was founded in 2012 and is based in San Francisco, California.
Its creators are: Ryan Fugger, Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen.
Ripple is a privately funded company. It has closed five rounds of funding, including two rounds of angel funding, one round of seed funding, one round A and one round B round.
Ripple provides one frictionless experience to send money globally using the power of blockchain. By joining Ripple's growing, global network, financial institutions can process their customers' payments anywhere in the world instantly, reliably and cost-effectively. Banks and payment providers can use the digital asset XRP to further reduce their costs and access new markets.
With offices in San Francisco, New York, London, Sydney, India, Singapore and Luxembourg, Ripple has more than 100 customers around the world. At present, it has about 200 employees.
In the summer of this year Ripple created three specialized tools: xCurrent, xRapid, XVia. Each of the three tools used to address a particular segment of the transfer market. XCurrent is the on demand application that uses banks to process customer payments. XVia is the tool through which businesses connect to RippleNet to send payments.
XRapid is the instrument by which XRP liquidity can be offered to those interested. In October of this year, Ripple announced: “Cuallix has become the world's first xRapid-Ripple solution to use the XRP as a liquidity tool to reduce the cost of sending US cross-border payments to Mexico.” This means that soon XRP will be used in cross-border transfers.
<< The Ripple Net Accelerator program is designed to allocate up to $300 million to create incentives to accelerate adoption. It's not dissimilar to the early days of Visa. The rough idea is “we will pay you Mr. Bank or Mrs. Bank to accelerate your use of this program. We will pay you in XRP. “If they do not want XRP, they have an option to use US dollars. >>
This is the answer given by Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple to a reporter who has asked them how they will convince banks to use the XRP currency in cross-border payments.
On November 28, 2017, at CoinDesk's consensus: Invest in New York, TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington revealed that they had raised $ 100 million for a hedge fund that will buy and hold encrypted assets while investing in token sales and shares and debts.
Launched under a new entity called Arrington XRP Capital, the fund will be the first to require all limited partners (LPs) to invest in XRP, the encryption that RippleNet's Ripple software runs. The fund will also use XRP for all distributions and fees.
Through its technology, Ripple has revolutionized cross-border money transfers. Through blockchain technology and XRP, the cost of cross-border transfers have decreased by 60%. Also, the most important aspect is to reduce the time that a money transfer used to take. Currently, through SWIFT and the outdated chain of correspondent banks, a cross-border money transfer takes between 3 and 5 days. Through Ripple technology and the XRP, a cross-border money transfer will take place within 4 seconds.
SWIFT
The Global Interbank Financial Telecommunication Company (SWIFT) based in La Hulpe, Belgium, was established in 1973. Its field of activity is the transmission of financial messages via the international SWIFTNet network.
Financial messages are used to facilitate cross-border money transfers. The company currently has about 2,000 employees.
SWIFT carries financial messages but does not hold accounts for its members and does not make any form of clearing or settlement.
SWIFT does not facilitate funds transfer: rather, it sends payment orders, which must be settled by correspondent accounts that the institutions have with each other. Each financial institution, to exchange banking transactions, must have a banking relationship by either being a bank or affiliating itself with one (or more) so as to enjoy those particular business features.
SWIFT has become the industry standard for syntax in financial messages. Most international interbank messages use the SWIFT network. SWIFT now manages $150 trillion in its messaging service.
In 2016, an 81 million usd theft from the Bangladesh central bank via its account at the New York Federal Reserve Bank was traced to hacker penetration of SWIFT's Alliance Access software, according to a New York Times report. It was not the first such attempt, the society acknowledged, and the security of the transfer system was undergoing new examination accordingly.
Soon after the reports of the theft from the Bangladesh central bank, a second, apparently related, attack was reported to have occurred on a commercial bank in Vietnam. Both attacks involved malware written to both issue unauthorized SWIFT messages and to conceal that the messages had been sent.
In response to the challenge raised by Ripple, SWIFT launched its Global Payments Innovation Initiative (GPII) initiative. Using the current SWIFT messaging system and banking correspondence, which is the backbone of the old cross-border payments, the GPII is essentially a set of rules that obliges banks to behave more rationally in cross-border payments, supported by tracking payments and data to monitor their compliance with new rules. However, as you will see in the conclusions of this article, GPII is far from being a real competitor for Ripple. GDPII remains an enhanced messaging service, and Ripple has a blockchain technology.
Conclusions.
Today, the world sends more than $150 trillion across borders. These amounts are almost entirely managed by SWIFT through its financial messaging service. Below, you can see a comparison between RIPPLE and GDPII.
I see many enthusiasts on various websites that already see Ripple managing these colossal sums. I say we are more realistic. The road that Ripple goes through is not easy. I say just as much: if Ripple succeeds to manage at least 2% of these in the first 5 years, it will be very good.
The 200 employees team at Ripple is very efficient. If they did not have an efficient team, Ripple would not be in this final stage of development. The fact that Ripple has convinced over 100 banks to test their technology proves this. There will be a battle between traditionalism and the new blockchain technology. The war of conquering this huge market will be tough and will last for years. No doubt the blockchain technology will be imposed. Ripple and XRP will slowly but surely win a slice of this huge cross-border transfer market.
I think the year 2018 will be an important year in the development and use of the XRP as the buffer currency in cross-border payments. At the time I am writing this article, XRP/USD is quoted at $0.70. Everyone asks when we have a new leap in the XRP price? New partnerships with banks will be announced soon. According to the latest information, XRP will be traded on Coinbase. But no doubt the news that will move the XRP price to $3-5 will be the use of XRP in cross-border payments. By then, HOLD!
“I don't think you can make a horse and buggy keep up with a race car”
(Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEO)
World of Beer Five Points is gone, and its successor will soon be gone too.
Late last month, Magic City Brew was born as owner Amir Shah left the Tampa-based franchise. The changeover officially happened Nov. 30, and it had scheduled a grand opening this Thursday.
"We left the franchise because the franchise wasn't providing any value benefit for us locally," Shah said. "We don't really look at Birmingham as a market that is embracing the World of Beer brand. Craft beer is our passion, and doing it as a local concept where it was locally run, locally owned, locally managed was really our hope."
Instead, the bar at 1005 20th St. S. will hold a grand closing. It will have clock-oriented drink specials, which will get cheaper as the inventory decreases. There's no set closing date, but Shah said he's aiming for Dec. 31. The kitchen is closed, and the restaurant donated all unused food to local charities.
"Business fell off a cliff for Five Points," Shah said. "We were not alone in our struggle."
World of Beer, the Tampa-based chain of bars and retail beer outlets, opened its Five Points South location in 2012. The bar specialized in craft beer, promising at least 500 beer offerings from around the world.
Magic City Brew had hoped to offer at least 250, but with a much larger offering of local, Alabama and regional beers and a new food menu.
"We were open for four years," Shah said. "There were a lot of great times. People met in that place, got married, celebrated their anniversaries in that place."
Jim Kessler, senior vice president for policy and a co-founder of Third Way, said Friday morning that Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) backing of a plan to expand Social Security compelled them and the president of the group to hit back with a Wall Street Journal op-ed lambasting the plan and economic populism.
"The impetus was really -- we saw after the most recently, this push that okay, it's time to really move the national Democratic Party to a much more liberal agenda, in this case, Senator Warren was the standard bearer -- she's on the cover of a lot of magazines," they said in an interview on Sirius XM with Ari Rabin-Havt. "We were a bit alarmed by that."
They added that Warren was an excellent senator from Massachusetts but questioned whether they could be good for the party nationally.
"That Social Security plan was the final moment for us," they said. "That Social Security plan had been out there but really languishing -- because Senator Warren has such a powerful compelling voice, they started talking about it, and it suddenly it became much more talked about and viable alternative."
They rejected the idea that the Monday op-ed was a way to take Warren "down a peg."
"She is a very compelling elected official and national figure," they said. "Her involvement in that particular bill, we just looked at it and said 'okay, this seems to be starting to get out of hand.'"
Every Israeli settlement in the West Bank, including those that are relatively well-off, is entitled to receive a "balancing grant" from the Interior Ministry to help it balance its budget, even though such grants mainly exist to help less well-off communities.
Construction work in Elazar, a settlement in the Gush Etzion bloc, in July 2010. AP
Moreover, the ministry allocated NIS 265 million in balancing grants to West Bank settlements in 2009, just over 10 percent of all the grants it distributed that year. As a result, each settler received NIS 115 on average - some 22 percent more than the NIS 94 per person allotted to towns within the Green Line that received such grants.
The two West Bank regional councils that received the largest per capita grants were the South Hebron Hills council, at NIS 288 per person, and the Jordan Valley council, at NIS 275 per person. Among individual settlements, those receiving particularly generous per capita grants included Immanuel (NIS 258 ), Kedumim (NIS 182 ), Kiryat Arba (NIS 150 ) and Beit El (NIS 141 ).
More prosperous settlements received lower per capita allotments. In the Gush Etzion bloc, for instance, the figure stood at just NIS 84, while in Har Adar it was a mere NIS 3 per person.
Altogether, the ministry distributed NIS 2.5 billion worth of balancing grants last year. No money is given to well-off towns, like Tel Aviv, which have sizable revenues of their own; the grants are meant to help less prosperous communities supply a basic level of service to their residents. But in practice, most Israeli towns run deficits and are therefore entitled to these grants.
How much money each town receives depends on various criteria, including the town's revenues, expenses, number of residents and pension liabilities. Towns must also meet certain tax collection targets to qualify.
However, the rules grant an edge to West Bank settlements and front-line communities within Israel, mainly those near the Lebanese and Gazan borders, which are considered to have higher security expenses: These towns' expenditures are automatically inflated by 4 percent, entitling them to larger grants.

In response, a ministry spokesperson noted that the Gadish Committee - the public committee that devised the current formula for awarding the grants - explicitly recommended that preference be given to front-line communities in Israel and the West Bank, and the cabinet adopted its recommendations back in 2003. But beyond this built-in preference, they said, settlements enjoy no special privileges in terms of grant allocations.
"Motivated by a beautiful woman and with the help of three close friends, I learned to surf so I could one day say, "I surf" says Philadelphia-based photographer Chris Sembrot when speaking on their project Urban Surfers. Shot entirely in natural light at 6:00 A.M, surfers are documented out of the water in the urban environment in a one-block radius from their home. “This project is a portrait series I'm shooting to document city dwellers who make the trek to the nearest shore with each passing swell. It's directly inspired by three friends of mine, Adrian Castillo, Chris "Cakes" Savaiano, and Jim "Hammer" Hammell, who took me under their wings and suffered through the humiliation (that I still bring when I go out with them) of helping a newbie. Their dedication to teaching and insisting I go out with them whenever they go helped me confidently say to that beautiful girl I met for coffee three years ago, "I surf."
It was the last night of the Puerto Rican Festival, safe behind a fence at Frontier Field, and the annual mayhem on the streets was about to begin.
Or so I thought.
It's one of the most predictable and embarrassing dates on the Rochester calendar. The Puerto Rican Festival closes, and a long, hot night of throwing rocks at cops begins.
At least that's what most of us think.
But then, most of us have never seen it. Oh, it's on the news and in the paper, and each year we compare stats about arrests and number of officers deployed, but across our region, only a small percentage have actually gone and witnessed what happens.
Including me.
And I decided to change that.
So last night at 6 I parked at the Tops plaza at Clinton and Upper Falls and just started walking north. I walked a square up Clinton to Avenue D and down Hudson to Clifford and back to Clinton, and I zigzagged the small streets that cross that area, paying particular attention to Clinton, Hudson and Remington, as I thought those might be the areas most likely to have troubles.
Sometimes I sat on the curb, or ingratiated myself onto a porch. I counted the police and analyzed their tactics and struck up conversations with people on the street. But mostly I just watched. What people were doing, the dynamic between them, the spirit of the place.
And I came away with something sweet.
I was reminded of my intense love for the people, places and cultures of the city of Rochester, and of my admiration and respect for the Rochester Police Department. I didn't see any rioting, and when rocks were thrown at officers I was a few blocks away and had to jog over. By the time I got there, everything was calm and a large number of officers with hats and bats stood quietly maintaining order.
I think that was the second level of their response.
The first was a number of five-car phalanxes of Rochester police cruisers moving as a unit under the command of a sergeant. You saw them all over, a quick-moving line of five or six squad cars, quietly around a corner waiting to be needed, or moving lights and sirens into place.
It was actually a brilliant police tactic.
At one point, on Clinton Avenue between Clifford and Avenue A, a crowd of a few hundred gathered on the sidewalks. Various souped-up motorcycles were parading and preening, and boys on bicycles were riding impressive wheelies. Then a man started burning rubber on a motorcycle, locking the front wheel and making clouds of smoke with their back wheel. This brought people off the sidewalks and into the street and in just a couple of minutes the dynamic of the situation changed, potentially in a negative way, especially from the standpoint of crowd safety.
Without hesitation, one of these five-car squads rolled right into the middle of it all, right up the street, and two officers immediately got out of each car. Burly men in sunglasses, one with a pepper-ball gun, and they just stood there, looking at the crowd.
No order was given, no confrontation took place, but a message was sent -- and obeyed.
Everybody got back on the sidewalk, a little boredom settled in, and things calmed down.
And after about 20 minutes the officers got back in their cars and drove off.
All of the major intersections were controlled by the police, limiting but not stopping traffic, and the state police helicopter hovered overhead.
Groups of five or six cars continued to snake around the area for hours.
It was a wonderfully effective, non-confrontational, measured way to police. I admired the plan and its execution. I was proud of the department and its officers.
But the night wasn't really about the police, and it wasn't really about interaction with the police.
It was about a good time. It was about thousands and thousands of people with an intense and joyous pride in their Puerto Rican heritage -- and many others who were caught up in it.
The best way to describe what happens is to call it a parade. But as opposed to a parade that has a specific course up a specific street, this parade ranges over any number of streets in any number of ways. And it is a parade that is as much about those watching as it is those passing.
The most obvious aspect of it are the hundreds of vehicles, many festooned with the Puerto Rican flag, which ride up and down the streets, honking their horns. Often there are people leaning out the windows, or sitting in the window sills, or on top of the vehicles, waving flags and shouting.
Overwhelmingly, these people are beautiful.
They are not rowdies. They are not toughs or thugs. Many of them are children, many of them are women, many of the vehicles are driven by mothers and grandmothers. You see in their faces not mischief and malice, but joy and mirth.
I was an old white guy walking down the sidewalk, and I was waved to and shouted at by countless cars, all sending me the same happy greeting anyone else got.
Watching these cars pass by, in yard after yard, are families.
Many have little kids in large numbers, some are adults on the grass or the porches. One large group I visited with on Hudson Avenue was presided over by a matriarch -- Mrs McFadden -- who was the grandmother of almost all the people there.
People sit and watch the passing cars, waving Puerto Rican flags back at them, or just enjoying the spectacle.
Except for the level of enthusiasm and maybe the volume, it is the same principle as any parade anywhere.
I watched this for more than three hours, and came away feeling like I had seen -- or participated in -- something sweet and good. Yes, the vehicular laws get ignored. Yes, some people might have been drinking themselves toward trouble. Yes, it was a good thing the police were omnipresent and prepared.
And, yes, it is dangerous. A Remington Street rollover last night -- undeniably tied to the revelry -- will probably cost a young woman their life. The vehicular and traffic laws flouted last night exist for a reason, and a night where anything goes -- as more than one person described the event -- is problematic in a society of laws.
But, yes, this was about kids and families and a sense of heritage and culture that some other parts of our society can't duplicate. I resist the romanticizing of minority culture that progressivism imposes, but I came away wishing the rest of us waved the American flag with the same vigor I saw the Puerto Rican flag waved. And I came away beginning to understand what this night is all about to those tied to Rochester's northeast.
They do not see it as rebellion, they do not see it as revelry. They do not see it as lawless or uncouth.
They see it as home. Their home. Their Rochester. As much a part of this town's heritage as the old feast of St. Anthony or the St. Patrick's Day parade.
Yes, it is different from the experience and traditions of many. But that doesn't make it bad. Perhaps I am naive, and got caught up in the spirit of it, but I thought it was beautiful. And I felt of its joy. I saw happy, well-kept and clean children being taught to love who they were and where they were from. I saw families of three and four generations celebrating together.
I saw goodness.
Yes, there were lawbreakers. And yes, there were 200 police officers keeping the thing in check, and not all the negative impulses were quashed.
But in the main this was a good thing.
Which is only news to old white guys like me, who watched it on TV, but never went.
I understand why this happens now. I understand the joy many take from it, and I understand better the important role of the police in maintaining order in an essentially disordered atmosphere.
I came away loving this town and its protectors all the more.
Young, old, Gen-Xer or millennial, we're all familiar with Goku and the rest of the Z-Fighters from Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball. Spanning across multiple medias such as mangas, animes, movies, video games and more, the Dragon Ball series has shown us some of the best fight scenes in the history of the world.
Since 1984, the monumental franchise has delivered amazing storylines and characters to boost its popularity and it's not hard to see why Dragon Ball has become a household name. The entire series focuses on Goku, a Saiyan who's bent on not only getting stronger but also on saving the entire universe from all beings that wish it harm. He's joined by the other Z-Fighters like Vegeta, Krillin, Piccolo and many more in their mission.
Since the series showcases battles that see mountains destroyed and seas turned to steam, we can always expect a good show whenever a new villain pops up to challenge Earth's mightiest. The series has produced some of the most powerful characters known to anime and manga alike but some are a cut above the rest. Here are the 15 most unfairly overpowered characters in Dragon Ball.

15 Gohan
In the early days of Dragon Ball Z, Goku and the rest of the Z Fighters had to babysit Gohan all the way. They were a kid then but their father, Goku, saw potential in Gohan and has even said that their son is far more powerful than him. We get to witness Gohan's might in the Cell saga as they transform into Ultimate Gohan.
As Ultimate Gohan, their power levels increase to staggering amounts. It goes up to levels that even Goku gets impressed with. Sadly, Gohan preferred to become a scholar than a fighter and after the Cell saga, Gohan's power was levelled down drastically. If they consistently trained like Goku the rest of their life, there's a pretty big chance that they can eventually overpower their father. Gohan has managed to only reach Super Saiyan level 2 but it's worth noting that they were the first to achieve the feat.
14 The Great Apes
Aside from transforming into blond overpowered beings, Saiyans can also transform into gigantic primates also called as Great Apes. While they're already formidable in their Saiyan forms, Great Apes take things to another level of destruction with their size and uncontrollable rage.
Unlike getting to their Saiyan forms, the Saiyans can't turn into a Great Ape on command. To become the gigantic primates, there has to be a full moon first. Though not as prominent as the Saiyan forms in the series, Great Apes are still considered as overpowered because of their size and strength.
We've seen the Great Ape forms of Goku, Gohan, Raditz, Nappa, Vegeta, Baby and several others more. The only weakness of Great Apes is their tail. Once cut, the Saiyans will revert back to their regular forms. That's easier said than done though as who in their right mind would go behind a Great Ape to cut off its tail?
13 Gotenks
Gotenks is the result of a fusion between Goku's second son, Gotan and Vegeta's son, Trunks. The two children of the great Saiyans are formidable fighters on their own already and for kids their age, they can definitely destroy a few of the Z-Fighters' enemies. When combined though, Gotenks proves to be a rather dangerous being.
Combining insane speed and power, Gotenks is an unfairly overpowered character despite being still a kid. What makes Gotenks even more powerful is their overconfidence which allows them to take on foes; regardless of who it is, without fear or second thought. This overconfidence is also the downside of Gotenks as it has gotten them in trouble on a few occasions.
Like their component beings, Gotenks is also capable of reaching a Super Saiyan form. In their base form, Gotenks is already formidable to a majority of the Z-Fighters but as a Super Saiyan, their power levels are without a doubt the best.
12 Broly
Appearing solely in one of the Dragon Ball movies, Broly is one of the most beloved and feared characters in the series' lore. Like Goku and Vegeta, he's also a Saiyan. When first seen, Broly is a man with a calm and harmless demeanor; which is very unlike their Saiyan race. Broly has dual personalities though; the other is far more dangerous but is controlled by a crown.
Without their crown, Broly will transform into their Legendary Super Saiyan form; a form both Vegeta and Goku are incapable of. Their power increases a hundredfold while in this form and their small well-built physique turns into something far more intimidating and dangerous.
Broly is known to have a brash attitude and that's why their father had to place the mind controlling crown on him. Broly's hate for Goku stems from the fact that when they were still babies, Goku's loud crying kept on bothering him.
11 Syn Shenron
Countless wishes have taken their toll on the Dragon Balls and the inevitable happens and unfairly overpowered creatures called Shadow Dragons were born. Among the Shadow Dragons is Syn Shenron, one of the most powerful enemies that Goku and Vegeta has faced and one that required a joint effort from the pair to fully destroy.
Syn Shenron has a far more powerful form called Omega Shenron, this is the form that pushed Super Saiyan 4 Goku and Super Saiyan 4 Vegeta to their limits. The pair had to fuse into Vegito and create the very powerful Vegito Super Saiyan 4.
When it comes to combat, Omega Shenron's strength is accompanied by their disregard for battle etiquette. Unlike Goku's past enemies, Omega Shenron is not shy to use dirty tactics to win and it's this trait that makes them one of the most powerful enemies in the series.
10 Kid Buu
Goku and Vegeta were in for a surprise when they defeated the seemingly unbeatable Super Buu. From the pink gelatinous monstrosity spawned another form of Buu called Kid Buu. Don't let the innocent and childlike physique fool you, Kid Buu is as destructive and as reckless as any of the other bad Buus.
While Super Buu remained calm and calculative in battle, Kid Buu is the physical embodiment of chaos. Like a kid, they throw fits of tantrums, which is bad for the Z Fighters as Kid Buu's tantrums can result in planets getting destroyed. They were crazy and insanely fast and it took Goku and literally the rest of the world to destroy him. In what seems to be one of the best fights in Dragon Ball history, Goku, along with the help of Vegeta and the entire population of Earth, created the biggest Spirit Ball ever. It was only then that Kid Buu was destroyed.
9 Frieza
Frieza was the first major villain in Dragon Ball Z and he's perhaps the most memorable one. The small physique and squeaky voice may make Frieza less intimidating but if a being can destroy mountains using their finger, then he's definitely not someone to be messed with.
It was Frieza that forced Goku to become a Super Saiyan the first time and that reveals just how powerful they are. They were ultimately destroyed by Goku and they came back as Cyber-Frieza but was again, destroyed by Goku. Why does Frieza keep getting destroyed you ask? It's because they don't train.
In Dragon Ball Resurrection F, Frieza makes a comeback again but this time, they decided to train before fighting Goku. All those times before was Frieza's all natural power. After achieving another form, Frieza proved to be a match against Goku but they were defeated nonetheless. They managed to destroy Earth during the fight but with a little help from Whis, Goku won.
8 Goku Black
One of the biggest fears of humanity is that Goku turns their back on us and begins having a change of heart. What would happen if Earth's best decides to become a villain instead? That would never happen of course but when the series introduced parallel universes, we got to see an evil version of Goku simply called Goku Black.
Goku Black is basically Zamasu that takes control of Goku's body in an effort to destroy all mortals. The result is an evil and heartless version of Goku. The base form of Goku Black is as powerful as the Super Saiyan level 3 of Goku! That's impressive considering how Super Saiyan level 3 is powerful enough.
Goku Black isn't capable of a Super Saiyan God form but they manage to create their own take on the form which they name Super Saiyan Rose. In this form, Goku Black manages to beat Vegeta and proves as an equal to Goku.
7 Vegeta
Also known as the Prince of Saiyans, Vegeta; despite being a few power levels behind Goku, is still one of the most powerful characters in the series. If they aren't such a hot headed Saiyan, then maybe, just maybe, they could've trained enough to surpass their mortal rival, Goku. Honestly speaking though, it's their jealousy of Goku's strength that keeps Vegeta pushing to become more powerful.
Their hot headedness has cost them their life on more than one occasion because they recklessly charge into battle whenever they become super pissed. Sometimes though, their hot headedness has allowed them to cause more pain to the enemies that terrorize Earth.
Vegeta is capable of reaching many Super Saiyan forms like Goku. The only exception is that they aren't able to reach Super Saiyan 3 as they skip to the 4th level instead. Despite their lacking forms, Vegeta is still capable of transforming into the more powerful Super Saiyan God.
6 Super Buu
There have been several versions of the pink gelatinous blob that is Buu. The fat Buu, also called Good Buu is the kindest. The skinny and brown Evil Buu is the harshest. The Kid Buu is the most unstable and fiercest. Super Buu on the other hand, this slim and tall Buu is the most powerful of them all.
Super Buu was created after Evil Buu turned Good Buu into a chocolate and ate him. The result is an unfairly overpowered character. They aren't initially that strong but when Super Buu seemingly devoured Piccolo, Gotenks and Super Gohan, Super Buu became almost unbeatable.
He's immoral and they don't have an ounce of conscience in him. Perhaps it's their personality that turns them into one of the most powerful characters in the series. If it wasn't for Vegito, Super Buu would've ended everyone in the series.
5 Goku
This shouldn't be a surprise now but Goku, the main protagonist and the one we all have grown up watching, is perhaps one of the most powerful characters in the Dragon Ball universe. They may have died several times throughout the series but when they come back, they come back several times stronger than they were before.
What makes Goku more special is that their strength comes from not only their Saiyan blood, but from their determination and will to become stronger. Aside from saving the world from whatever forces that want it gone, Goku is intent on training to become one of the strongest fighters in the universe.
In their regular and normal form, Goku is already a menace to most of the villains that seek to destroy Earth. When they transform into their Saiyan forms, especially their Super Saiyan God form, the unlucky enemy on the other end is as good as gone. The Earth is lucky to have Goku on their side.
4 Gogeta
Two beings combining into one gives Dragon Ball fans something to look forward to as through fusions, we have seen some of the most powerful characters there are. Perhaps the most powerful character fusion in the entire series is Gogeta; who is the fusion of Goku and Vegita.
Honestly speaking, Gogeta is easily overpowered by Vegito, a far more superior fusion of Goku and Vegita. What makes Gogeta overpowered though is the fact that it has a form that results from the level 4 Super Saiyans of both Goku and Vegeta. We only got to see Gogeta Super Saiyan 4 in one story arc though.
Gogeta Super Saiyan 4 was the one who defeated Omega Shenron; the same Omega Shenron that made light work of the Super Saiyan 4 Goku and Vegeta in one battle.
3 Beerus
Beerus was first seen in the movie, Dragon Ball Battle of the Gods. He's basically one of the most feared creatures in the entire universe because they basically destroy any planet that they beat the best fighters of. Don't let their rabbit features fool you, Beerus is one of the very few enemies that even Goku couldn't beat.
When Beerus lands on Earth, it's Goku that takes them up to their challenge and Beerus beats Super Saiyan 3 Goku in 2 strikes. After Goku succeeds in achieving their Super Saiyan God form, they challenge Beerus yet again. The match lasts several times longer than their first encounter but Goku falls short still.
Proud of their match, Beerus decides to not destroy Earth anymore. Even more surprising than their change of heart is when they state that Goku is only the second best fighter they have ever faced.
2 Whis
When moviegoers first saw Dragon Ball Battle of the Gods, many initially thought that Beerus was the leader in the Beerus/Whis pair. That's the total opposite because Beerus revealed at the end of the movie that the strongest fighter he's ever faced; yep even better than Goku's best form, is none other than their master, Whis.
At first glance, Whis is easily thought of as the usual villain's assistant that doesn't offer much when it comes to battle. After the reveal at the end of the recent movie, fans saw Whis at a whole new level. Whis has yet to display their full potential when it comes to battle but he's believed to be the fastest being in the universe.
Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama gave fans a small idea of what Whis' full potential really is. On a rating of numbers, Goku is a 6, Beerus a 10 and Whis, a whopping 15.
1 Zen-Oh
Like most of the unfairly overpowered beings introduced first in Dragon Ball Super, Zen-Oh, also called The King of All, isn't too keen on showcasing their fighting prowess. Despite this, The King of All is still the most powerful character in the entire Dragon Ball universe, no questions asked.
Zen-Oh holds authority over all the 12 universes introduced in Dragon Ball Super. He's basically The Creator in Akira Toriyama's stellar manga franchise. In a story filled with several characters that can destroy planets in one move, how strong can the omnipotent being of the universe be?
In one occasion, Whis states that there used to be 18 universes. That's a lot but as of the current story arc in the manga, there are only 12 universes remaining. What happened to the other 6? Zen-Oh destroyed them all simply because they had a mood swing.
Legendary 80's alt rockers, The Cure have not released any new material since their 2008 LP 4:13 Dream, so you could imagine the buzzing excitement in an arena of ecstatic fans when the iconic group decided to debut not one, but two new tunes at their New Orleans performance last night. The tracks were posted on Overblown via fan recordings with videos of the concert and Soundcloud streams with a slightly better sound quality.
80's lovers of sadness, rejoice! Legendary originators of Alt rock, The Cure have unveiled not one, but two beautiful new songs, check them out!
The songs are currently being named by fans based on what they heard and are indicative of The Cure's seemingly infinite honey pot of songwriting finesse. On the first and slightly more upbeat tune, Step Into The Light, the legends bounce high over that cheery yet cynical tone that made them famous.

In the more morose balladry of It Can Never Be The Same, frontman, Robert Smith bled their signature, sombre drawl over the captivated audience and let us all know, he's still got it. The Cure is due to head over to Australia to perform at Splendour In The Grass in July and have already started lining up some sideshows. Check out the tunes below and soak in the sad.

Too late. The Bush legacy as a 21st century torturer is already cemented, but we've got a flip flop on waterboarding:
A senior Justice Department official says laws and other limits enacted since three terrorism suspects were waterboarded have eliminated the technique from what is now legally allowed. “The set of interrogation methods authorized for current use is narrower than before, and it does not today include waterboarding,” Steven G. Bradbury, acting head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, says in remarks prepared for their appearance Thursday before the House Judiciary Constitution subcommittee. “There has been no determination by the Justice Department that the use of waterboarding, under any circumstances, would be lawful under current law,” they said.
More after the jump…
It is the first time the department has expressed such an opinion publicly. CIA Director Michael Hayden stopped short of making a similar statement in testimony about waterboarding before Congress last week. Bradbury in 2005 signed two secret legal memos that authorized the CIA to use head slaps, freezing temperatures and waterboarding when questioning terror detainees. Because of that, Senate Democrats have opposed their nomination by President Bush to formally head the legal counsel's office.
So three years ago, this guy allowed torture, now they say it isn't legal. What changed? The law they claim but in reality it's because they got busted, that's what changed. Vintage Bush administration double speak. And, as we all know well, just because anyone in the Bush administration says something, it doesn't mean it's true.
How many times did Bush tell us the U.S. doesn't torture? They lied.
"In 2007, Islandia produced 500 coconuts, which residents sold to themselves for $1 each, and imported 1 barrel of oil, which cost $100. The oil was paid for by borrowing from foreigners.
Ready to calculate GDP? We want the dollar value of domestically produced final goods and services, to wit, the dollar value of the 500 coconuts. Got the answer? Very good. Nominal GDP in Islandia for 2007 was $500. If you wanted to describe that in real terms, you'd call it 500 coconuts. You don't count the oil in either nominal or real GDP because Islandia didn't produce any oil.
Here are the numbers for 2008. We grew 510 coconuts, sold them for $1.01 each, and still imported 1 barrel of oil, paying $125 for it. So nominal GDP was $515.10 (a 3% increase) and real GDP was 510 coconuts (a 2% increase). The change in the implicit GDP deflator would be the change in the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP, namely, +1%.
But wait a minute, Islandia's pundits decry. How can your crummy accounting claim that inflation was only 1%? Last year we bought 500 coconuts and 1 barrel of oil for $600, but this year if we tried to buy the same thing it would cost us $630. The inflation rate, they tell you, is obviously 5%, not 1%. You must have intentionally cooked the books, they charge, just to make the economy appear better than it is!"
value
in how much they can buy for it
After I posted a comment under a post by James Hamilton , it seems that the issue over terms of trade and what should be considered real GDP has finally started. James Hamilton has commented the issue here , , anonymous blogger "knzn" commented the issue here and Brian Wesbury commented the issue here . Hamilton's fellow econbrowser blogger Menzie Chinn commented the issue here , but they really doesn't argue for or against it and instead simply explained the difference between the production deflator and the purchases deflator.I start with James Hamilton. They use a "Crusoe"-island approach, which I kind of like.However, as much as I like the approach, their conclusion is wrong. As they wrote, what we want is theof domestic production. But what value? Value is not intrinsic in the things we produce, value is value in terms of the things we want. The value of a worker's earnings does not lie in how many things they produce, but. Saying that terms of trade is irrelevant for the value of domestic production is like saying that the relation between wage and consumer price levels is irrelevant for real weekly earnings of workers.The logic behind the GDP deflator approach would thus imply that if a company executive tells workers that they're going to have to accept a 90% wage cut even as their cost of living is unchanged, they shouldn't mind because the workers will continue to work as hard and produce as many goods as before for the company and since their personal GDP deflator falls 90%, the value of their wages are unchanged (even though their nominal wage is down 90% and their cost of living unchanged)! Similarly, a company executive could tell shareholders not to worry about the 50% decline in revenues since that decline was entirely the result of reduced prices on the goods they sell, and since the company's GDP deflator is down 50%, revenues aren't really down at all!Or similarly, supermarkets could raise prices by 50% and tell customers that they shouldn't mind paying more because their wages (their personal GDP deflator) haven't been raised! And suppliers to a company could similarly tell the company that they shouldn't object to paying more to them as long as they abstain from raising the price they charge their customers! Or in the case of Islandia, those foreign oil producers could tell them that even though the world price is $125, they shouldn't mind paying them $200 since that won't affect the GDP deflator and thus not reduce real GDP!As for knzn, they take a different approach and says that they do not care about the value of production. Well, they are free to care or not to care about whatever they want, butthe vast majority of people do care about the value of their income and that is why people laugh at Phil Gramm's "mental recession"-remarks ( See here for a clip of how people spontaneously laugh when Obama tells them about those remarks) that contradict their daily experience even as the official GDP statistics support Gramm. Economists who want people to think that GDP isn't something laughable better care.He continues by saying "Personally, I care a lot more about the people that don't have jobs, or potentially won't have jobs in the future." But first of all, why then look at GDP numbers in the first place? Why not only look at employment numbers? And secondly, the employment numbers are far more consistent with the terms of trade adjusted GDP number as employment has been falling (and would have fallen a lot more if not for the flawed "Birth/Death" model).He then says that they care more about productivity (which they define in unadjusted terms) because that is supposedly more stable then terms of trade movements. But even setting aside the fact that GDP is supposed to measure the value of production regardless of how stable or not certain aspects are, it is not true that productivity is particularly stable. If you go to the Bureau of Labor statistics web site, you see that their measure of productivity (non-farm business output per hour) moves up and down in a quite erratic way. In 2003 for example, productivity at an annualized rate rose by 5.6% in the second quarter and 10.3% in the third quarter only to fall by 0.4% in the fourth quarter.As for Brian Wesbury, who delivered the by far the worst GDP forecast of all economists(3%, even as they assumed a 3% increase in the GDP deflator!), they agree that 1.1% is a far too low inflation figure and notes like I did that if you deflate the nominal GDP increase with the domestic purchases deflator, real GDP declined. However, they say that would be misleading and says that if you include import prices to calculate real GDP you must add imports to GDP, a sum they say increased more than 5%. But that does not follow. What the domestic purchases price index include is first of all usually not directly import prices, but the prices of various forms of domestic demand, like private consumption, government consumption and business investments, and that is usually not the same even for imported goods, as the retail price of for example a sweater made in China includes the margins of the American retailer (and often also wholesaler). That means that including imports would double-count it. However, as discussed above, the value of domestic production is determined (partly) by how much imported goods that domestic production can buy.
Ever had the need to write an Excel plugin? Check this out.
Atila Neves opened their lightning talk at DConf 2017 like this:
I'm going to talk about how you can write Excel add-ins in D. Don't ask me why. It's just because people need it.
From there they go into a quick intro on how to write plugins for Excel and gives a taste of what it looks like to register a single function in a C++ implementation:
Excel12f( xlfRegister, NULL, 11, // 11: Number of args &xDLL, // name of the DLL TempStr12(L"Fibonacci"), // procedure name TempStr12(L"UU"), // type signature TempStr12(L"Compute to..."), // argument text TempStr12(L"1"), // macro type TempStr12(L"Generic Add-In"), // category TempStr12(L""), // shortcut text TempStr12(L""), // help topic TempStr12(L"Number to compute to"), // function help TempStr12(L"Computes the nth Fibonacci number") // arg help );
Two things to note about this. First, Excel12f is a C++ function (wrapping a C API) that must be called in an add-in DLL's entry point ( xlAutoOpen ) for each function that needs to be registered when the add-in is loaded by Excel. For a small plugin, the implementations of any registered functions might be in the same source file, but in a larger one they might be a bit of a maintenance headache by being located somewhere else. Also take note of all the comments used to document the function arguments, a common sight in C and C++ code bases.
The example D code Atila showed using excel-d is a world of difference:
@Register( ArgumentText("Array"), HelpTopic("Length of Array"), FunctionHelp("Length of an Array"), ArgumentHelp(["array"]) ) double DoublesLength(double[] arg) { return arg.length; }
Here, the boilerplate for the registration is being generated at compile-time via a User Defined Attribute, which is used to annotate the function. Implementation and registration are happening in the same place. Another key difference is that the UDA has fields with descriptive names, eliminating the need to comment each argument. Finally, the UDA only requires four arguments, nine less than the C++ function. This is because it makes use of D's compile-time introspection features to figure out as much as it possibly can and, at the same time, optional arguments (like the shortcut text) can just be omitted.
Since this is a Project Highlight on the D Blog, we're going to ignore Atila's opening request and ask, “Why?” There are actually two parts to that. First, why Excel?
Our customers are traders, and they work with Excel as one of their main tools. They need/want to, amongst other things, receive live stock updates in a cell and have their formulae automatically update. There's other functionality they'd like to have and that means adding this to Excel somehow.
Of all the possible languages that could be used for this purpose, the business chose D. That brings us to the second part of the question: why D?
This is possible in Visual Basic, Python or C#, and possibly other languages. But none of them match D's performance. C++ does, but it's tedious and requires a lot of boilerplate to get going. D combines the speed and power of C++ with the reflection capabilities of those other languages. No boilerplate, just code, runs fast.
There's more to the story, of course. The company is heavily invested in D.
We use D for nearly everything, even some “scripts”. The bulk of it is calculations for market indicators. Lots of data in -> munge -> new data out that needs to look pretty for traders. So integrating with existing code was an important factor.
Even though excel-d is targeting Windows, much of it was actually developed on Linux.
We use a Linux container as our reference development machine, but people use what they want. I do nearly all of my work on Linux and only boot into Windows when I have to. For the Excel work, that's a necessity. But, as usual for me, I wrote all the tests to be platform agnostic, so I do the Excel development on Linux and test there. Every now and again that means a particular quirk of Excel wasn't captured well in my mocking code, but it's usually a quick fix after that.
They say they use both DMD and LDC for development, and both are running in continuous integration.
Although DMD doesn't technically require Visual Studio to be installed (out of the box, it generates 32-bit OMF objects, and uses the OPTLINK linker, rather than the VS-compatible COFF), anyone doing serious work on Windows is going to need VS (or the Visual Studio Build Tools and the Windows SDK) for 64-bit and 32-bit COFF support. The latest LDC binary releases currently require the MS tools (support for MinGW was dropped, but according to the D Wiki, could be picked up again if there's a champion for it).
Atila already had VS on their Windows partition. For this project, they got a bit of help from the VS plugin for D, Visual D.
I had to install VisualD because our reference project for Excel was in a Visual Studio solution, but afterwards I reverse engineered the build and didn't open Visual Studio ever again.
Currently, excel-d has no support for custom dialogs or menus. Both items are on their TODO list.
If you're working with D and need to write an Excel add-in, or want to try something cleaner than C++ to do so, excel-d is available in the DUB package registry. If not, the sponsors of the project, Kaleidic Associates and Symmetry Investments, have made several other open source projects available. They are interested in hiring talented hackers with a moral compass who aspire towards excellence and would like to work in D.
excel-d was developed by Stefan Koch and Atila Neves.

— Festive red cups are back at Starbucks along with holiday favorites like Peppermint Mocha, Chestnut Praline Latte, and Eggnog Latte.
“It's huge! People who don't even go to Starbucks regularly come during the holidays because we have the red cups,” said barista Skyler Shelley.
But not everyone is happy with the design of this year's cups because they lack the holiday symbols.
An article posted to Breitbart.com calls the plain red cups the “War on Christmas,” alleging that all signs of the holiday have been removed as the cups previously depicted images of ornaments and snowflakes.
Shelley said: “Couple customers come in and are like: Why are there no snowflakes?”
One critic said: “I definitely think it could have been a little happier and swirls or something on there.”
Another wrote on social media: “They'll destroy everything that they can get their hands on, even a simple cup of coffee.”
A third person cried: “Star-bah-humbugs!”
The “War on Christmas” outcry has some people boiled over.
“I don't know why someone has so much time on their hands they're worried about whether or not Starbucks corporate put Christmas items on a cup. As long as the coffee tastes good, I don't care what cup it's in,” said customer Lena Gurevich.
Some body else said: “Overreaction by both the Left and the Right is what's killing this country. Changing a paper cup isn't a ‘War on Christmas', you idiot.”
Starbucks didn't respond to a request for comment. But its website says: “In the past, we have told stories with our holiday cups designs,” Jeffrey Fields, the vice president of design and content for Starbucks, said on the company's website. “This year we wanted to usher in the holidays with a purity of design that welcomes all of our stories.”
“Starbucks has become a place of sanctuary during the holidays,” Fields said. “We're embracing the simplicity and the quietness of it. It's more open way to usher in the holiday.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday revived talk of the possibility the United States may move its embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, saying President Donald Trump was seriously considering the matter.
During the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, Trump's team spoke often about moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. But since taking office, the contentious issue appears to have moved to the backburner.
“After decades of simply talking about it, the president of the United States is giving serious consideration to moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,” Pence said in a speech to the influential, pro-Israel U.S. lobbying group AIPAC.
Israel regards Jerusalem as its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all countries to base their embassies there, though Israeli politicians also understand that moving the U.S. embassy there could be destabilizing.
The relocation is strongly opposed by many U.S. allies as the Palestinians also claim the city as their capital.
The final status of Jerusalem is supposed to be determined via direct negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
If the United States were to relocate its embassy, it would be seen as an explicit recognition of Jerusalem belonging to Israel, potentially pre-determining the outcome of eventual peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
The U.S. Senate on Thursday narrowly confirmed Trump's pick to be ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer allied with the Israeli right, who favors moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.
On Wednesday settlers under police protection move into the Natcheh family house in Beit Hanina. (Photo: Ahmad Gharabli / AFP)
A few weeks ago the Natcheh family, who live in East Jerusalem, caught an almost unheard of break for Palestinian families when city officials canceled an eviction order for their house in Beit Hanina.
But pressure from Aryeh King and their organization The Israel Land Fund, which posted and ad calling for “strong men [who] are wanted to legally evacuate Arab squatters,” re-instated the order and now, approximately eight settlers have moved into the house. Jeff Halper, who is following the story and has met with the family, emailed me today details of the eviction:
After months of harassment from settlers and the police, on Wednesday morning the police came and evicted the 14 members Natcheh family from their home, with all their belongings (we have a picture and a report on our ICAHD website). Several members of the family were arrested, but we don't know why as yet. Rather than demolish the home, however, which is usually the case, the police escorted a group of settlers into the home, where they took possession. Aryeh King's lawyer even made a statement to the press that its good that Jews are retaking their properties and announced plans to build 60 homes for Jews (only, of course), in the heart of the Palestinian neighborhood of Beit Hanina. Its just another example of how Jews are able to win dragged-out court cases on flimsy grounds because the Palestinians do not have the financial resources to compete with them (there was NEVER a Jewish community in Beit Hanina), and witness to the fact that Palestinians like the Natcheh's are unable to reclaim their families' properties and homes inside Israel. 85% of the Palestinians driven from their homes in 1948 (where they owned 40% of the land and housing in WEST Jerusalem) lived — and many have died — just a few minutes away from those homes that they could never repossess.
The Natchehs have lived in their mutli-family home since the late 1980s, and have reportedly used the property since the 1930s, when they used to have a small factory.
EMBED >More News Videos The fire that destroyed a building under construction in Oakland's Uptown neighborhood burned so hot that it registered in space. Here's a look at some of the most incredible imagery from the blaze.
The builder tells the I-Team there were "no known threats" to this project before today's inferno, but it appears to fit into a string of suspected arson fires in the area in recent years.The marketing photo for the "Alta Waverly" project shows its promise -- 196 units of badly-needed housing in Oakland, 31-thousand square feet of retail.But the project was in a crucial stage before the fire retardant and stucco was applied. It was just timbers, a skeleton, ready to burn.Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf spoke what was on many people's minds this morning: could this be arson?"We know that two recent fires on the Oakland-Emeryville border were confirmed as arson," Schaaf said. "And that is incredibly disconcerting to us."Some workers in hard hats told us they suspect the motive was the use of non-union labor. Some neighbors believed anarchists set the blaze.Oakland City Council Member Abel Guillen posted on their Facebook page, "Burning down housing under construction doesn't help make Oakland housing more affordable. It only speeds up displacement of existing residents. #smh."A spokesperson for the developer, Wood Partners of Atlanta, told us the company recognized the dangers and took steps to protect the project."Wood Partners had added security on this," said Sam Singer, spokesperson for Wood Partners based in Atlanta. "There were several officers 'round the clock. There were security cameras."The Alameda County Joint Arson Task Force is on the case, adding the Alta Waverly to a list of projects under construction that have burned -- several in just the past year.Fire officials fielded a question about one possible sign of arson. Did the fire have multiple points of origin?Acting Oakland Fire Chief Darin White told a news conference, "We have very trained and capable individuals who will look at every piece of evidence they can to ensure that they're leaving no stone unturned to ensure that they understand what the cause of this incident was."Wood Partners is talking with its investors to determine if they will try to rebuild after this horrible setback."It is too soon to say exactly what's going to happen," said Sam Singer. "But we're big believers in Oakland and we're big believers in this neighborhood and the community."The I-Team also spoke off-camera with several builders who work in the area. They are frustrated that none of those recent suspected arson fires has been solved. No one has been arrested.
LOWELL, Mass. — For the second night in a row, Massachusetts-Lowell staged a third-period comeback to extend its unbeaten streak to 11 games. The River Hawks erased a 4-1 Northeastern lead and tied the game with 55.3 seconds remaining. Then with 1:53 left in overtime, Christian Folin blasted a one-timer into the top corner to send the largest crowd in Tsongas Center history into a frenzy.
Joseph Pendenza cut the lead to 4-2 with 11:07 left in the game when they raced down the left wing and beat Bryan Mountain (33 saves) glove-side. Five minutes later, Derek Arnold made it 4-3 with a power-play goal that came less than a minute after they had a goal waved off. The score remained that way until the final minute. With the extra attacker on, Riley Wetmore pulled the puck out of a scramble in front and fired it past Mountain.
What I saw
-Northeastern blew another third-period lead. For the third time in the last four games, the Huskies led by two goals or more in the third period and couldn't close out the game. They did still end up with the win against BU last weekend, but not before they blew a three-goal lead. This weekend, they saw a two-goal lead turn into a tie last night, and a three-goal lead turn into a loss tonight. When this happens early in the season, you can write it off as a team still finding its way and still learning how to close out games. But it's the end of January now. There's no excuse for it. Even if it had happened just once, you could chalk it up as a bad night. But three times in two weeks is indicative of a bigger problem. Whether it's a conditioning issue or a coaching issue or a players issue, I don't know. But whatever it is, it could very well cost the Huskies a playoff spot.
-Joseph Pendenza registered a goal and three assists and really played a remarkable game, possibly their best in a Lowell uniform. They assisted on Lowell's first goal, scored the second, and then assisted on both the tying goal and the winning goal. They led all players with six shots on goal and an incredible plus-4 rating. Beyond the numbers, though, they were just a terror for the Northeastern defense all night. They were aggressive all game and consistently created scoring chances, whether it was making good decisions with the puck or driving hard to the net without it.
What I thought
-Like Friday's game, this wasn't exactly a goaltending duel. Both goalies gave up a bunch of juicy rebounds, and both goalies paid for it on a couple goals. Doug Carr, who got pulled Friday night, didn't have a great weekend, but he's proven he's a good goalie and I'd expect them to still get some starts even when Connor Hellebuyck comes back. Northeastern's goaltending is much more concerning, though. Chris Rawlings' inconsistency throughout their four years has been well-documented, and Mountain hasn't really been much better. He'll make some great saves, but then let one in that they should've had. Add in the defensive struggles in front of the goalie, of which there are many, and it's easy to see why the Huskies are fighting for their playoff lives.
-The River Hawks didn't really come anywhere close to playing their best hockey this weekend. They only sustained offensive pressure in spurts, they didn't do as good of a job clearing out the front of their own net as they usually do, and, as previously mentioned, Carr wasn't really on their game. But despite all that, they still came away with three points. Part of being a good team is winning even when you don't bring your A-game, something the River Hawks couldn't do earlier in the season. They'll obviously need to be better moving forward than they were this weekend, but they can also be encouraged by the fact that they came back twice and proved to themselves that they're never out of a game.
What they said
-Lowell coach Norm Bazin: “Well, it was an exciting hockey game tonight. We certainly made it dramatic, more dramatic than the coaches would like. But obviously it went our way, so we're very, very pleased with the result. I thought it was a tale of two games. The first half we definitely lost. The second half we definitely won.”
-Northeastern coach Jim Madigan: “We obviously let it slip away. We worked hard for two and a half periods, and then we just let it slip away at the end. We've got to get better and have more composure later in games. … We got tired a little bit, I think more mentally than physically, and they capitalized. They're a good team. I thought we were weathering the storm, but then we made a couple bad plays late in the period and they capitalized.”
What else you should know
-The game drew a crowd of 7,013, the largest in Tsongas Center history. The fans didn't have much to cheer for most of the game, but as Lowell came back and eventually tied it, they got very loud. The fact that Lowell drew a record crowd against a ninth-place team really speaks to the ever-increasing excitement around this program.
-With the win, the River Hawks moved into a tie for fifth in the standings with Merrimack. They remained seventh in the Pairwise as of 11:05 p.m. The Huskies dropped to ninth in the standings with the loss.
-Northeastern defenseman Drew Ellement left the game in the first period with an apparent leg injury and did not return. They were involved in a post-whistle scrum and ended up falling awkwardly. They tried to come out for another shift a couple minutes later, but then they left for good. Madigan said after the game that they aren't yet sure of the extent of the injury.
-Ryan McGrath was back in the lineup for Lowell after missing Friday's game with an undisclosed injury. Connor Hellebuyck missed a third straight game with an undisclosed injury. Bazin said on Friday that Hellebuyck is day-to-day.
An adviser to President-elect Donald Trump has said that the Americans are hoping for a trade deal within the "first six months or the first year of the Administration".
Anthony Scaramucci, an American financier and entrepreneur, told ITV News that they did not want to "exaggerate" the speed with which a deal can be struck.
But, they said Trump's team would want to arrange something between the US and the UK within the first year of theirs being in office.
The president-elect is "for fair, free trade", they said, to increase the flow of goods and services between the US and other countries.
Mr Scaramucci also said that the US would "take the steps necessary to make sure the UK is at the front of the line as opposed to the back of the line, on trade deals".
When ITV News pushed them for clarification on whether Britain would be number one in the queue, they said: "I don't want to say number one, but I think you're pretty close.
"We see the unique, special relationship bond and love that these countries and people have for each other."
Borderlands: Everyone Needs a Hand! Hey everyone as you know we got a charity pledge coming up and we are trying to raise

Ever been down on your luck? Ever been so broke you wish you could afford that $5 Pizza from Miss Moxxi's place? Well I certainly do and I have been there before so I want to help out and so does my team! So if you want feel free and drop a dollar or two towards the International Rescue and also feel free to join us for our charity pledge where we will have a few surprises for everyone who joins in also!
Assuming they get here in time for the pledge. But We can't spoil the surprise just yet and thank you everyone for listening to what we got planned and remember it only takes one person to make a difference in the world. You just got to be willing to work to make that difference.
Update 1: Thanks to the people at International Rescue you can donate now if you want too!

Union, First Student bus company to meet in Washington, D.C. Wednesday
Bus drivers for the company First Student have authorized a strike, but it won't be until at least Thursday that any buses stop running. Union members who work out of the company's Belmont location overwhelmingly rejected the company's latest contract offer and approved a strike Monday night. A strike could affect districts in other parts of the state. A union spokesperson told News 9 the two sides will meet again Wednesday in Washington, D.C., in hopes of reaching an agreement. On Monday night, districts that use First Student for their busing services said they don't anticipate any disruptions before Thursday. School districts are putting together backup plans in case an agreement is not reached. Buses will run as normal on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Malcolm Turnbull rejects claims new-look Cabinet not selected on merit as ministry sworn in
Updated
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has hit back at internal detractors, arguing no-one could suggest their new-look ministry was selected "on any basis other than merit".
Newly promoted ministers have been sworn in by the Governor-General at a ceremony in Canberra, while those who were dumped are deciding on their futures.
Mr Turnbull dramatically changed their frontbench on Sunday, adding three women to Cabinet to take the total to five, including making Marise Payne the nation's first female defence minister.
Key points: Hockey, Abbott, Andrews and Abetz to leave frontbench
Three women to join Cabinet taking total to five
Speculation Hockey may be appointed as ambassador to Washington
It will be an unfamiliar front bench to many, with MPs including Tony Abbott, Joe Hockey, Kevin Andrews and Eric Abetz all departing, as well as the surprise omission of Bruce Billson.
Mr Turnbull said they selected a ministry that was ready to engage with the future and that meant some people had to go.
"Today we are forming a government for the 21st century. A ministry whose composition and focus reflects our determination, to ensure that Australia seizes the opportunities of this the most exciting times in human history," they said at the ceremony.
They rejected internal Liberal Party concerns their allies in the leadership coup were rewarded for their roles.
"No-one could suggest that this Cabinet, this ministry has been assembled on any basis other than merit," they told the AM program this morning.
"It's very tough to make those calls but that's what leaders have to do. You have to have turnover and renewal," they said.
Mr Turnbull has acknowledged Mr Abbott would be reeling from the events of the past week.
"I feel for Tony," they told Channel Nine.
"I've got a pretty good understanding of what he's going through. It's a rotten time and they will need lots of support.
"But the show has to go on, this is the Government of Australia."
Speculation Hockey may take ambassador position
For Mr Hockey, it is the end of a 20-year career.
After an agonising week of speculation that they would lose their job as Treasurer, they told Mr Turnbull yesterday they would not seek a front-bench job and would quit Parliament in due course.
However, there are rumours of a new job coming soon.
"I believe they have a further contribution to make in our nation's service," Mr Turnbull said, without giving further details.
Independent senator Nick Xenophon said they suspected that could mean an appointment as ambassador to Washington as Kim Beazley's successor.
"There's going to be a vacancy in Washington soon for Australia's ambassador to Washington," they said.
"I can think of many people who would be much worse than Joe. I think Joe, if they were going to take up a diplomatic position, would actually do Australia proud."
Mr Billson, the outgoing Minister for Small Business, said they were reflecting on the next stage of their political career with their family and support network.
"I had hoped to continue my full contribution leading the Coalition's work on energising enterprise through excellent policy and advocacy on behalf of Australia's small businesses and family enterprises," Mr Billson said in a statement.
"Having made this ambition clear, Prime Minister Turnbull and I spoke [on Sunday] and I was advised that I would not be provided that opportunity."
Mr Abetz has been dumped as Employment Minister. They wrote on Facebook that they were disappointed not to be included in the new Cabinet but said they had always put their role as a Liberal senator for Tasmania first and they looked forward to continuing to do so.
Payne makes history as first female defence minister
Their Senate colleague Senator Payne will make history when they are sworn in as the first woman to be Australia's defence minister.
Five women now in Cabinet
Foreign Minister Julie Bishop
Health Minister Sussan Ley
Defence Minister Marise Payne (pictured)
Employment Minister, Minister for Women Michaelia Cash
Assistant Treasurer, Small Business Minister Kelly O'Dwyer
New South Wales senator Arthur Sinodinos told Sky News their appointment had a message.
"It is a big challenge but they were up for it and they wanted it, and if we win the next election there would be continuity because I would imagine that they would continue to be the defence minister," Senator Sinodinos said.
"So we are investing in someone who can be there for the longer term."
Senator Sinodinos said the military had made a lot of progress as an example to the rest of society about what happened when glass ceilings and other barriers were smashed.
They said Senator Payne partly symbolised that change but that should not take the focus off the important work they and others in the National Security Committee would have to do.
Senator Sinodinos will be Cabinet secretary, despite being called to give evidence to the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption.
They said they would not have made themselves available for the Cabinet if they did not think they could deal with whatever emerged from that process.

Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler), Archer (H. Jon Benjamin) and Cheryl Tunt (Judy Greer) share a tense moment in the fifth season finale of Archer Vice. Copyright FX Networks.
Adam Reed's spy series Archer underwent a bit of a change this season, with the animated heroes forced by the FBI to jettison their spy business in exchange for lives of crime and cocaine-selling. And country western music production. As you can imagine, they've approached the crime business with the same bravado and dysfunction that they used to approach the spy business. Luckily, there're still the same people keeping things running smoothly behind-the-scenes. Floyd County Productions has been there from the beginning, in fact, and with five seasons under their belt – and two more still to come – art director Neal Holman and animation director Bryan Fordney practically have the process down to a science. Overseeing a staff of sixty at their Atlanta-based studio, the duo open up about their economical approach to keeping Archer and their crew looking so darn good, using 3D software to create the 2D world of Adam Reed's hilariously tight scripts.
Watch the fifth season finale, “Archer Vice: Arrivals/Departures,” tonight, April 21st at 10pm on FX.
Archer and the rest of the ISIS gang are the guests of Gustavo Calderon (Fred Armisen) and their wife Juliana (Lauren Cohan). Calderon is a big fan of Charlene but Juliana is a bigger fan of Archer.
Dan Sarto: Tell me a little bit about how this wonderful series comes together. What are your roles and what's your production pipeline like?
Neal Holman: Archer is not your average cartoon. We work very, very quickly and the department heads and production heads have all worked together for so long that our process is really streamlined. A script is written and then things start to sort of branch outward. I will start working with the storyboard team and while they're busy storyboarding a scene, my associate art director Chad Hurd and I will be designing backgrounds and then working with our character designers. At the same time, we're working with our 3D department helping to build the background designs into 3D environments. On the other side of the track, the producers are casting and doing the voice recording with our actors. By the time they are done with an audio edit, we will have storyboards to put to their audio and then pass that off to our illustration and background directors. That's when they start building Archer in a jungle suit or Archer in a tuxedo. The background department will be painting over renders from our 3D environments. Bryan takes all of these elements and the animatic with audio and he'll line up all of the elements to go with it and begin animating and compositing.
Bryan Fordney: Another unique thing about the Archer pipeline is that the animation process is actually done separate from the drawing. The drawings are done based on the storyboards and the illustration director also sort of directs drawing sequences. We use Adobe After Effects for the character acting, which is almost more similar to 3D animation than it is to traditional animation because we are essentially creating rigs, like 3D character puppets, but we are doing it in 2D. That allows us to work very quickly and it allows us to add various subtleties that we wouldn't be able to do with traditional animation.
Pam Poovey (Amber Nash) makes a deal that puts everyone in danger.
DS: So the backgrounds are done using 3D software tools?
NH: Yes. The way we get a design going is Chad Hurd and I will work on something that we think best suits the needs of the scripts and the aesthetic that Adam is going for in their scene. We'll get their thoughts on it and once a design is locked, we give it to our 3D team and they build that environment. Once it's built, we can put our camera anywhere inside it and kick out a render and then pass it on to our background team, our painters, who pain over that render. So, it's not just an out-of-the-box render that goes straight to television. It goes through our painters first so it looks more like a painting than it does a stale 3D render.
DS: Now, am I mistaken or is some of the 3D animation done somewhere else in the Midwest?
BF: Trinity Animation does a lot of 3D work with us, like the 3D environment builds I'm talking about. We rely on them pretty heavily. They're at Lee's Summit, Missouri.
Ray Gillette (Adam Reed) and Krieger (Lucky Yates) move some dangerous cargo.
DS: What program do you use for the 2D characters?
NH: Adobe Illustrator is where we're building all of the elements for the character rigs. We'll draw Archer standing in a tuxedo, but that one illustration of Archer in their tuxedo is split up into several different layers, so that their hand is on a layer, their forearm is on a layer, their bicep is on a layer, etc. In After Effects, we'll link those three layers together, so that when I move the bicep, the forearm and the hand move with it. It becomes like a puppet rig.
BF: The heads themselves are like a whole other beast, though. When we draw on a body, we put a dummy head on it because the actual head is a really complicated rig that takes a long time to develop and we stick on everybody that we draw.
NH: It's all about economy and getting the most of what you are doing. There are a lot of smoke and mirrors. We try to make it look like a lot of animation, but we're very economical. If we are going to build a head then that head rig is going to be really good. We'll build it once and use it throughout the year. We are trying to use every bit of everything and nothing really goes away. Any body that Archer is drawn in, like a suit or polo shirt or whatever, you will see repurposed on drones in the background throughout the season. Nothing goes to waste here with our illustrations and our rigs!
Cocaine processing has very few perks for Cyril Figgis (Chris Parnell) and Ray.
DS: But on the flip side, when you look at the finished episodes, it doesn't look like a minimalist visual presentation. It looks very stylized.
NH: That's the goal.
BF: There has to be a balance, but we really do feel like the important thing about Archer is just how it looks.
DS: Right, right.  They are all about their looks! Turning the subject to Adam Reed for a second, do they send you a finished script and then you work with them on the creation of the storyboards?
BF: We usually get a script that isn't quite locked, but not far from it. When he's ready to get FX's response, that's the draft we get and start building from. Adam is just such a strong writer that we can go ahead and start moving forward with the major builds. And after that, once we have done a pass of Act One, we will send them a PDF of the storyboards along with some notes to guide them through it and he'll send back whatever feedback they have. After all these seasons, I have a pretty decent idea of what Adam is going for when they write a script or a scene, so the notes have been pretty minimal.
There is another storyboard revision after we add in the audio. In most shows, storyboard goes straight to audio and that is a luxury that we don't have because of our schedule. We generally finish storyboards for a full episode in two weeks and two days, and that's moving really quickly for four people. Sometimes when the audio comes in, an actor's read will be much different than how we were reading it when we were doing the boards, so we have to make revisions. One of the best things about our production is that we can turn on a dime and still keep things move pretty fluidly.
NH: Also, we don't just start one episode, work it until it is done and then start another – they are all overlapping in various stages. So, while one episode is being written, the previous episode is being storyboarded and the episode before that is being built and the episode before that is being animated. We generally have four or sometimes five episodes going in production at one time.
Cheryl is more than a match for a group of bikers.
DS: What's the total timeframe for the production of an episode?
NH: I think it's ten weeks, is that right Bryan?
BF: Yes, that sounds about right.
DS: Do you do the post yourselves at Floyd County Productions?
NH: A strange thing about this show is that the post work is done in After Effects, the same program that we use to do the character animation.
BF: The editing is done in Final Cut by an editor, but we often have to make adjustments in After Effects for timing and everything.
NH: The only thing that's really not done in-house is the recording and audio mixing.
The unflinching voice of reason - Malory Archer (Jessica Walter).
DS: Adam Reed told me recently that the team at Floyd County regularly manages to make the gags in the script so much funnier than they ever imagined…
NH: Well, one example that comes to mind is episode 402, I think…the one with Lucas Troy, who was Timothy Olyphant last season….
DS: Oh, yes, their close buddy…
NH: …Archer's best friend. That episode ends with a just silent shot of Archer, Lana and the car. The comedy in it comes from Archer's facial expression – that tells the whole story. We just stay on their faces as they think about the horrors they've just gone through. It was kind of funny in the script, but just seeing the way Bryan's team really sold that makes it stand out in my mind as one of the best examples of our character acting.
BF: Yeah, the cool thing about that was it was the last step in the production. One of our animators just decided, “Oh I'm going to make these really hilarious frowny faces on these characters at the very end.” It really wasn't planned out that way.
NH: Because we have such talented improv actors on our cast, I think a lot of people believe the show is primarily improv and I'd say…95% of it is written. What seems like improvised jokes are actually written on the page and that speaks to Adam's natural talent as a writer.  They are really incredible. We're a little spoiled in that we get Adam Reed scripts every two to three weeks. When we have to shift and work on other projects, I always hold [the other writers] to that same standard and there is always a disconnect at first, because they are not Adam.
BF: There is a real confidence in the scripts. Like, if we are confused partway through the production because, “This joke just isn't working,” and then we look back at the script we're like, “Oh. That's because we didn't do it by the script!”
Archer takes a break from love making and narco-trafficking...but only for a short while.
DS: The stuff is brilliant on a lot of different levels. I think the visual design of this show so beautifully compliments the tone and the comedy that I cannot think of another visual style that would make it any better.
NH: Yeah. When we were doing the pilot we wanted something with really bold line work, thick heavy lines. We just didn't want to look like another Family Guy or Simpsons. A lot of the cartoons that we were seeing had this razor thin line work and that's not to knock those cartoons – it was just something we didn't really want to follow suit with. We wanted something that would be different and give a more graphic appeal to the characters. We wanted the backgrounds to have these lush painted textures. At first it was looking more like a ‘60s comic book but it has sort of morphed from there.
DS: Last question – what are the biggest challenges you face day-to-day and week-to-week in bringing Archer together?
NH: Some of it is dealing with how best to do really cinematic sequences with limited animation and limited time. That is something I actually really enjoy because it gives you constraints to work against. We definitely don't have an unlimited budget and we definitely don't have unlimited time…but we swing for the fences in our storyboards and really try to make the biggest, baddest car chase we can and then boil that down into logistical elements that we can actually do. It's one thing to board a giant fight scene and it's quite another to plan it out to where you can do it without killing all of your animators.
BF: Yeah, and on these big action episodes, you're really trying to find a balance between the action-packed sequences and the natural comedy of the voiceover work, which is the core of the show. With normal episodes, that just comes along naturally, but when we get to these crazy episodes with tons of adventure, it's vital to find a balance.

The Brooklyn Nets have reached an agreement to sign free-agent big man Andrea Bargnani, the team announced Sunday.
The deal is for one year at the $1.4 million veterans minimum, with a second-year player option, the New York Post's Tim Bontemps reports.
ESPN's Marc Stein had reported Saturday and earlier Sunday that Bargnani was nearing a deal with the Sacramento Kings. The former No.1 pick ended up taking less money to sign with Brooklyn, Stein reports.
Bargnani, who will be 30 at the start of next season, played 71 games with the New York Knicks over the last two seasons. They averaged 13.9 points and 4.9 rebounds in 28.8 minutes per game. Injuries to their elbow, calf and hamstring caused them to miss more than half of their team's games.
•​ MORE NBA: What boos? Kristaps Porzingis solid in Summer League debut
Analysis: The jokes will be in no short supply, but what's the real harm here? Brooklyn took a chance on a bottomed-out player who was once regarded highly. So long as expectations and Bargnani's minutes remain reasonable—as would be suggested by their minimum salary—then this is a marginal deal with marginal upside. The Nets needed playable bigs as it was, and that need has only been exacerbated by Thomas Robinson's recent knee surgery. Does Bargnani make for ideal rotation filler? Hardly. Could they be occasionally helpful in a small, low-risk role for a mediocre team? Sure. — Rob Mahoney​

The first pictures from the forthcoming production, Kamchatka's Bears: Beginning of Life are anything to go by, their latest movie is certain to become a worldwide success. Picture: Igor Shpilenok
The stunning first images have been released of a new documentary showcasing the life of bears in the Siberian wild.
Filmmaker Igor Shpilenok, 55, knows better than most the beauty and majesty of the nature surrounding us, having spent years taking images of it with their camera.
And if the first pictures from the forthcoming production, Kamchatka's Bears: Beginning of Life are anything to go by, their latest movie is certain to become a worldwide success.
The website for Shpilenok's company Lesfilm explains the documentary will showcase 'the world of nature that lives in line with its laws, but is friendly to those who enter it with respect and an open heart'.
'Today I could see a male bear trying to seduce an impregnable female. At first they were falling at their feet, and then beautifully slid down the snow.' Pictures: Igor Shpilenok
Two storylines in particular feature in the production, one about the unrequited love of a male bear and the other of a mother and their playful cubs.
Speaking from Kambalnoe Lake on the Kamchatka Peninsula, Igor said: 'Today I could see a male bear trying to seduce an impregnable female. At first they were falling at their feet, and then beautifully slid down the snow.
'It was all just for her, but they aren't impressed, and it was in vain. They left in different directions. But that's OK because in a couple of days she'll be more accommodating.'
Igor joked that filming of the bear cubs is 'under threat' because the crew have been besotted by enjoying the antics of the family.
'In crucially important moments we're laying down in the snow laughing instead of focusing on work. We are very lucky with this family.
'First of all, the portly mother Maria Mikhailovna is almost not afraid of people. Most likely, they came from Kurilskoye Lake where they got used to lots of visitors coming to look at them
'That's when we all laugh out loud, which interferes shooting and sometimes even makes it impossible. Cub even manages to sleep on mom's back.' Pictures: Igor Shpilenok
'Out of the seven bear families we found, Maria is the only one who allows people to observe at a distance of 50metres or even less. Sometimes they even bring the cubs a dozen steps closer to us, as if they were boasting.
'Actually it's a typical behaviour of female bears in South Kamchatka's federal park. They keep close to humans to keep the cubs safe from male bears who are eating the babies when there is a lack of food.'
They continued: 'Secondly Maria has an outstanding son. He's got so much personality. We call them Chapay. He's using their mum to ride on them back in a way I have never seen.
'That's when we all laugh out loud, which interferes shooting and sometimes even makes it impossible. They even manage to sleep on their back.'
Kamchatka's Bears will be filmed over an eight month period and turned into a 90-minute production for release in 2017. It is described as 'a unique observation of bear families to uncover the mysteries of the growing up of new-born bear cubs'.
Igor said: 'Existing documentaries on bears were all filmed over a short period of time. The disadvantage of such projects is that the plot is set by humans, not by the nature. Russia is called the tsarstvo, the kingdom, of the bear, but we know nothing of the real personality of our symbol.
'How do bears grow, how do they study, how do they interact socially?'
'Maria has an outstanding son. He's got so much personality. We call them Chapay. He's using their mum to ride on them back in a way I have never seen.' Pictures: Igor Shpilenok
Kurilskoye Lake, a Unesco World Heritage site, is the biggest in Eurasia for the breeding of salmon, with the bears attracted to the waters. There can be up to 200 bears at a time on the shore.
Russia has about 110,000 brown bears, and populations have been relatively stable in recent years, though over-hunting remains a serious problem in some regions.
The Lesfilm team comprises a number of skilled professional experts in their fields, among them ecologist Dr Valentin Sergeyevich Pazhetnov, who is dubbed 'uncle bear'.
Shpilenok is accustomed to Russia's rural wildlife, having set up home with their wife and four sons in the Bryansk forest, not far from the borders with Ukraine and Belarus.
A fellow of the International League of Conservation Photographers, they are a winner of the 2006 BBC Wildlife Photographer Competition and their work has been published in numerous international and Russian magazines.

Today we just landed three new Web Console features you can play with in tomorrow's Firefox Nightly builds!
On a related note, Victor Porof also landed the new network monitor which gives you a very nice UI for working with the log of network requests and responses. The new tool uses the Web Console actors we worked on for making the Web Console remotable - both tools share the same network logging mechanism.
Evaluate JavaScript in the current stackframe
Whenever you are debugging a script in the page you can now evaluate JavaScript and inspect objects from the Web Console. Make sure you select in which stackframe you want to evaluate your code - just switch to the desired frame in the Debugger view. Until today the Web Console locked up while debugging pages. For technical details, see bug 783499.
This feature required a number of important changes. The Web Console now uses only the debugger API to access the content JS objects. With these changes we are fixing a number of bugs reports by users.
New object inspector
The old object inspector popup has been replaced with the same variables view from the debugger, allowing us to fix long standing issues with the old inspector. This is not just pretty UI: you can now filter/search through the properties by name and value, edit property name and value, delete properties, and more. You can also use JavaScript helper functions from the web console, inside the variables view: when you edit a value you can just write $("foo") or whatever you wish.
With this change object inspection works slightly different: you will notice that many of the methods and properties of DOM objects show in the prototype of the objects you inspect. The switch to the debugger API brings the Web Console in line with the JavaScript debugger.
The new Browser Console
To enable the Browser Console make sure you set devtools.chrome.enabled to true in about:config (Firefox restart is needed). Open the Browser Console from the Web Developer > Browser Console menu item.
The new Console is meant for browser and addon developers: you can see all window.console API calls, from all windows, all script and style errors/warnings, and all network requests from all over the browser and from addons.
We plan to replace the Error Console with the Browser Console as soon as possible: the Error Console provides users with fewer capabilities than the Browser Console, and it is not remotable. You can currently connect to any Firefox Mobile, Firefox OS and Firefox for desktop instance and see all of the logs in the Browser Console from the remote instance.
Given the amount of logging happening we plan to support better ways of filtering output. For example, we would like to allow developers to filter messages by addon.
Obligatory screenshot:
The screenshot shows the Browser Console with the new object inspector.
What is next
All of the three features are the outcome of a lot of work from the entire team. Still, I want to thank Panagiotis Astithas and Jim Blandy for the debugger-related work and reviews, and Victor for the variables view work.
Download a Firefox nightly build, play with the new features until you break them. :) Please let us know if you have any comments and report any bugs you find!
Giving Mini Burgers To Mice Reveals The Good And Bad Of Cooking Meat
Ah, to be a Harvard laboratory mouse. The pay stinks, but the food is delish! Researchers at the venerable school have been serving lab mice tiny organic burgers made with meat from Savenor's Market, where Julia Child bought them steaks.
"It came out looking like a beautiful little mini hamburger," says Rachel Carmody, a graduate student in evolutionary biology at Harvard who cooked up the mini-burgers in Petri dishes.
This feast for furry critters was all in the name of science, of course. Carmody and their colleagues served up the mini burgers as part of an experiment to determine the differences in energy provided by cooked versus raw foods.
It turns out that cooked meat delivers more energy than the raw version — which may have given ancient humans an evolutionary advantage. But the extra energy from cooked food may now translate into unwanted pounds because nutrition labels don't reflect the fact that we process cooked food more efficiently.
The mice loved the mini-burgers. But they also appeared to enjoy eating raw cubed meat, and meat that was pounded to make it easier to digest. And they snarfed down raw, pounded and cooked sweet potatoes as well.
The mice lost weight when they ate only meat, because mammals aren't very good at metabolizing all-protein diets. But they got more energy out of the cooked meat. They maintained body weight while eating cooked sweet potatoes, but lost 10 to 15 percent of their body weight in just four days when chomping them raw.
"In both foods, cooking improved the energetic value of the diet," Carmody tells The Salt. They say theirs is the first study to measure the net energy gain in cooking meat. The study appears online in this week's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The cooked dishes may also have tasted better. At the beginning of the experiment, half the mice preferred raw foods, while half went for cooked. At the end, all 17 mice preferred cooked.
Though these experiments were done in mice, they support recent thinking on human evolution, too. Anthropologists increasingly believe that when human ancestors figured out how to cook meat, they earned a survival advantage.
Early humans ate raw food like tubers, roots, and berries. It took a big gut and a lot of energy to digest that food, and the brain lost out.
Eating meat, which is packed with fat and protein, helped fuel development of humans' large, complex brains, some anthropologists think. Cooking meat and vegetables made proteins and starches easier to digest, delivering even more energy. NPR's Chris Joyce tucked into a steak last year to report on how meat and cooking may have fueled human evolution.
It looks like that still holds true today, and not just for mice. Research in humans has found that people gain more weight when they're eating more meat, including chicken.
Carmody's study suggests that people who might want to watch their energy intake aren't getting much help from nutrition labels, which underestimate the calories in cooked food. Late last year, the federal government finally got around to requiring nutrition labeling on meat sold in grocery stores. But the labels won't be required until 2012. And the new labels won't take into account the increased energy availability in processed, cooked meats.
So modern-day omnivores can rejoice in the fact that a simple hamburger is a beautifully engineered energy delivery system. But they should also remember that those little Harvard mice grew plump dining on tiny gourmet burgers from Julia Childs's butcher. "The mice were eating meat from Savenor's," Carmody says, "while I was eating meat from the local bodega."
Russian hackers are not the source behind the recent WikiLeaks release of leaked secret data on German-US intelligence cooperation and a parliamentary inquiry into it, Der Spiegel reports, citing unnamed security officials who have indicated it's an inside job.

The respective German officials are “confident” that the documents published by WikiLeaks were not obtained through a cyberattack last year on the Parliament (Bundestag), allegedly committed by Russian hackers. “Contrary to various media reports, there is absolutely no indication that the documents were stolen during a cyberattack on the Bundestag in the year 2015,” Der Spiegel writes, citing its own source. Back then, the intruders seized some 16 GB of information.

Last week, Frankfurter Allegemeine Sonntagszeiting reported that, according to a top security official, it was likely that WikiLeaks indeed got its material from the alleged Russian hackers.The allegation, however, was countered by a German MP from the Green Party (Bundnis 90/Die Grunen), Konstantin von Notz.
When the 2015 hacker attack was investigated, it was specifically stated that the [NSA] investigation committee was not affected,” they told Der Tagespiegel.
According to the latest information, Bundestag police, a separate security unit, now assume that the source for the WikiLeaks release of some 2,400 documents was from within the parliament itself, an unnamed spokesperson confirmed, according to Der Spiegel. “Following the release of confidential documents from the NSA Investigation Committee [in the German parliament], the Bundestag police are investigating the perpetrators in the parliament,” the outlet says.

Early this month, the president of the country's parliament, Norbert Lammert, allowed an internal inquiry into the case over “infringement of official secret and an obligation to maintain confidentiality." A potential perpetrator is facing up to five years in prison if found guilty.
On December 1, Wikileaks released 90 GB of print-screens of the papers from the German intelligence (BND), as well as from other ministries and spy agencies. The documents are part of the ongoing inquiry in the German parliament into the extent of ties between the BND and US National Intelligence Agency (NSA). The respective cooperation came to light back in 2013 following the revelations by a former NSA employee, Edward Snowden. Part of the leaked documents pointed to the fact that German intelligence acted on behalf of the NSA while spying at home and abroad, spurring outcry among the German public and many local officials.
This isn't an easy piece for me to write, being as that I'm exhausted from all the winning. If you recall, that was a promise Donald Trump made to us -- you know, that if we elected them President of these here United States, we would eventually become exhausted from all the winning. The man has not even been sworn in, and I am already wiped out.
All this economic optimism is exhausting. Watching all these jobs saved and created is taxing my 50-year-old system to the brink. Opening up my year-end IRA statement and jumping up and down for two hours over the stock market Trump-Bump -- holy moly, I need a nap.
And just when I think I'm catching my wind, there is this amazing piece of news…
"Voters Want Trump to Concentrate On Jobs"
Oh, sorry.
My bad.
That's not The News.
That is the bland headline under which the leftwing Politico hid The News -- actually they buried it screaming alive under almost a dozen mind-numbing paragraphs filled with information no one cares about. Basically, the entire Politico piece reads like this…
…Trump's inauguration speech, will take place minutes after noon Eastern Time, a Friday, the third of the month when the equinox touches Aries in its gravitational wave outside of Uranus and Trump beats Obama in our head-to-head poll, but 49 percent say they won't plan on watching Trump's speech, while 14 percent aren't sure.
Wait? Stop. What was the middle thing again?
Did Politico just say it conducted a poll where voters chose Trump over Obama for president?
Because when you consider the fact that both Obama and Trump have been publicly claiming that they would beat the other, that seems like news to me.
Why, yes -- yes, Politico did conduct that poll and Trump does beat Obama 45% to 44%:
The poll also shows voters evenly divided on a recent point of contention: whether they would rather have President Barack Obama continue for a third term – which is prevented by the 22nd Amendment limiting presidents to two terms — or whether they want Trump to take office this year. Forty-five percent of voters say they want Trump to serve as president for the next four years, while 44 percent want Obama to continue as commander-in-chief.
Of course Politico buried this news. The national media always smothers Narrative Killers.
Look around, what are we being told over and over and over again? That the Evil Unpopular Trump lost the popular vote and Precious Obama is bounding out of office with a public approval rating over 50%.
And those stats are correct.
But what is also true is that only 44% of the American people want to suffer through a third term with Super Popular President SlowGrowth.
What is also true is that after 18 months of the media savaging Trump and 8 years of this very same media licking Obama's boots, covering up their sins, and grading them on a curve, Evil Trump still beats Obama the Sun God.
Man, I gotta sit down.

BlackBerry today reported a Q3 2014 operating loss of $4.4 billion, up from $965 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to one-time charges related to unsold smartphones and the decline in value of the company's assets.
Further Reading Report: BlackBerry to cut up to 40 percent of employees
"During the third quarter, the Company recognized hardware revenue on approximately 1.9 million BlackBerry smartphones compared to approximately 3.7 million BlackBerry smartphones in the previous quarter," BlackBerry reported. "Most of the units recognized were BlackBerry 7 devices. During the quarter, approximately 4.3 million BlackBerry smartphones were sold through to end customers, which included shipments made and recognized prior to the third quarter and which reduced the Company's inventory in channel. Of the BlackBerry smartphones sold through to end customers in the third quarter, approximately 3.2 million were BlackBerry 7 devices."
BlackBerry 7 was replaced by BlackBerry 10 early this year, but sales aren't good. Of the $4.4 billion quarterly loss, $1.6 billion is "a primarily non-cash, pretax charge against inventory and supply commitments, or $1.3 billion after tax, which is primarily attributable to BlackBerry 10 devices," the company said.
A further $2.7 billion charge is attributed to "a non-cash, pretax charge against long-lived assets." BlackBerry warned such a charge could be possible in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing after the end of the previous fiscal year. Essentially, the charge recognizes a decline in value of the company's infrastructure due to the fact that its revenue isn't high enough to support that infrastructure.
"As at March 2, 2013, the Company's long lived assets had a carrying value of approximately $5.8 billion. The assets represent items such as the Company's network infrastructure, owned office buildings and certain intellectual property, among others," BlackBerry said. "The current macroeconomic environment and competitive dynamics continue to be challenging to the Company's business and the Company cannot be certain of the duration of these conditions and their potential impact on the Company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to fully recover the current carrying value of these assets. If it is determined that sufficient future cash flows do not exist to support the current carrying value, the Company will be required to record an impairment charge for long lived assets in order to adjust the value of these assets to the newly established estimated value."
In today's earnings report, BlackBerry said the $2.7 billion charge was based on the results of an analysis of its long lived assets. Separately, there were "pre-tax restructuring and legal and financial advisory charges of approximately $266 million."
The $4.4 billion loss compared to a profit of $14 million in the same quarter last year. BlackBerry lost $965 million in Q2 2014, primarily because it overestimated how many new phones it would sell.
Excluding all of the one-time charges, BlackBerry's operating loss was $354 million for the quarter, up from an adjusted loss of $248 million in the prior quarter and up from $114 million in Q3 2013.
Despite the bad news, BlackBerry CEO John Chen struck a positive tone. “With the operational and organizational changes we have announced, BlackBerry has established a clear roadmap that will allow it to target a return to improved financial performance in the coming year,” Chen said in the earnings announcement. “While our Enterprise Services, Messaging and QNX Embedded businesses are already well-positioned to compete in their markets, the most immediate challenge for the Company is how to transition the Devices operations to a more profitable business model.”
BlackBerry did increase the amount of its cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments from $2.6 billion at the end of the second quarter to $3.2 billion at the end of Q3.
BlackBerry will continue to reduce operating expenses in Q4, the company said. As for its partnership with Foxconn, the five-year agreement means that "Foxconn will jointly develop and manufacture certain new BlackBerry devices and manage the inventory associated with those devices... BlackBerry will own all of its intellectual property and perform product assurance on devices through the Foxconn partnership, as it does currently with all third-party manufacturers." This will reduce BlackBerry's risks related to unsold products.
Hillary Clinton's trustworthiness issues have dramatically reduced the Democratic front-runner's lead over the summer months.
While Clinton held a 60-point lead over Bernie Sanders in June, they now lead them by a mere 15 points nationally, according to a poll released on Sunday. If Joe Biden were to enter the race, Clinton's lead would shrink to 7 points.
This sharp decrease in support since the beginning of the summer directly correlates to the revelation of details surrounding the former of secretary of state's private email server. Sanders, on the other hand, has seen a dramatic surge of support amongst Democratic voters due to their far-left policies that appeal to progressives and their large rallies, which attract thousands of voters. As a result, Sanders currently leads Clinton in New Hampshire and is gaining significant ground on them in Iowa.
In the GOP, Donald Trump and Ben Carson are neck in neck the lead of the race, followed by Carly Fiorina and Marco Rubio, who are both tied for third place. Trump falls at 21 percent, Carson has 20 percent, and Fiorina and Rubio both have 11 percent of the Republican primary vote. The poll shows a significant change since Scott Walker's exit from the race, as the Wisconsin governor held 15 percent of the GOP vote and held second place in the same July poll.
Behind the Republican front-runners, Jeb Bush holds 7 percent of the vote, John Kasich has 6 percent and Ted Cruz has 5 percent. None of the other eight Republican primary candidates earned more than 3 percent of the primary vote.
The NBC/WSJ poll was conducted September 20th-24th among 256 Democratic voters and 230 GOP primary voters. This is from an early release of the poll and the full results will be released on Monday evening.

A judge Monday dismissed a delinquency petition against a 17-year-old Shorewood girl who, having given birth to a boy in their bathtub, hid their body in their bedroom and eventually buried them in a flower bed behind their house.
The case, Children's Court Judge Karen Christenson said, turned on the issue of intent: The law required the state to prove not only that the girl concealed the infant's birth, but also that they did so with the specific intent of keeping officials from determining if the child was born dead or alive.
While the girl unquestionably tried to conceal the birth, Christenson said, they may have acted simply to avoid alienating their friends or disappointing them mother.
The girl told police that the baby was conceived in early winter of 2010, around the time of their 16th birthday. They said that although they did not gain weight or feel sick, they began to suspect they were pregnant in July 2011.
They said "she found it hard to move around," the petition says, "but was far too busy and didn't have time to worry about anything too much."
The girl, the petition says, did not see a doctor and did not take a pregnancy test.
The girl delivered the boy on Aug. 17, as they soaked in a tub to relieve severe back pain. They told authorities the birth was unexpected and that they were "in complete shock."
Shorewood police testified at the hearing that the girl placed the baby on the floor of the bathroom and then used their phone - not to call for help - but to Google how to cut the umbilical cord.
Unable to find the information they needed, they cut the cord with a pair of scissors.
They told investigators that they thought the baby was dead but couldn't be sure.
They put its body in a shoe box, which they hid in the bottom drawer of their nightstand. They then went into their living room to watch television.
After about a week to 10 days, the girl's mother complained about a foul smell coming from the bedroom.
The girl placed the shoe box containing the baby in several plastic bags and then, as their mother slept, buried the bundle in a small flower bed behind their house.
In September, the girl's mother noticed a foul smell coming from the garden and discovered the remains.
The medical examiner office ruled that, because of decomposition, it could not determine if the baby had been born dead or alive.
Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Hanson appeared shocked by Christenson's decision but had no comment.
The girl's attorney, Gilbert Urfer, praised the judge for making a tough call.
"I think this is just a tragic case for everyone concerned," they said.
"Not all tragedies are crimes."
Novi, Michigan (CNN) Gov. Scott Walker on Monday sought to use President Barack Obama's slipping popularity on foreign policy issues as a punching bag and sought to bolster their own credentials ahead of a likely presidential bid.
Speaking in Novi, Michigan, the Wisconsin Republican rallied around the plight of a Michigan man who has been held hostage in Iran since 2011 and blasted Obama for failing to do enough on the missing man's behalf -- as well as failing to ward off attacks by Islamic terrorists around the world.
Speaking at an Oakland County Republican Dinner, Walker listed terrorist acts committed by individuals affiliated with ISIS and others who sympathize with the group.
"That's something that worries you not just about places elsewhere around the world; you suddenly start to realize it's happened in France, in Belgium, in Canada. Lord knows what happened in the last day or so down in Texas and elsewhere around the country," they added. "You start to realize this isn't something we can just leave to page seven in the newspaper."
Construction crews pour cement where they began installing steel posts on the Strip near Aria hotel-casino Monday, Nov. 13, 2017 to protect pedestrians, locals and tourists walking along Las Vegas Boulevard. Bizuayehu Tesfaye/Las Vegas Review-Journal @bizutesfaye
During their first meeting of 2018, Clark County commissioners will ease their way into the year with a relatively light agenda highlighted by bollards.
The commission on Tuesday will consider approving the installation of another 500 steel posts between the street and sidewalks along the Strip to improve pedestrian safety. The posts would be placed between Tropicana Avenue and Spring Mountain Road.
Muller Construction, which finished installing close to 800 posts along the Strip in December, would be paid an additional $2.5 million for the new work.
The bollards are 15 to 18 inches beneath the ground and anchored by interconnected, underground steel frames. The posts are about 4 feet tall and strong enough to stop a flatbed truck traveling 55 mph, county staff has said.
Altogether, the posts will shield about 3,200 feet of sidewalk.
County commissioners also are scheduled to consider:
— Ratifying the appointment of Anna Danchik as county comptroller
— Eliminating the county's mail ballot precincts
— Relocating the county's juvenile assessment center, The Harbor, to 861 N. Mojave Road, Las Vegas
— Entering a $9.57 million contract with Cobblestone Construction to remodel parts of McCarran International Airport

Contrary to popular belief, drowning does not necessarily involve a wholesale ingestion or aspiration of water or other fluids. During cases of secondary drowning, very little fluid is actually present in the victim's lungs. This small amount of liquid is still enough to make the lungs no longer able to deliver life-sustaining oxygen to the bloodstream, however, and the victim eventually succumbs to the lack of oxygenated blood. Death is generally attributed to a pulmonary edema , similar to the effects of acute pneumonia or wet drowning.
In 2008, a ten-year-old boy in South Carolina died in their bed an hour after swimming in a pool for the first time. Their death was attributed to a phenomenon known as secondary drowning. This condition can be difficult to recognize, since the victim initially appears to be OK after a near-drowning incident. In some cases, however, enough water has entered the lungs to cause a drop in blood oxygen levels, and death may occur between one and 48 hours later. This condition is sometimes confused with dry drowning, in which a laryngospasm causes suffocation.
One thing which makes this condition so difficult to detect is its slow acting nature. A victim may breathe in a very small amount of fluid and believe they or they have successfully expelled it through coughing. In reality, the water may fill up some of the oxygen-rich pores of the lungs, reducing the lungs' ability to oxygenate the blood as it passes through. The heart does not slow down appreciably during this process, so the victim can still walk and talk. The only symptoms may be a sudden change in personality or level of awareness as the blood oxygen level drops over time.
Victims may or may not feel the effects of secondary drowning immediately. Children and anyone who has experienced a near-drowning should be watched closely after leaving a swimming area. Vomiting or involuntary defecation immediately following a swimming session should be considered a red flag. A sudden change in personality or energy level, such as agitation or extreme lethargy, may be a sign of oxygen deprivation. If a child has inhaled water while swimming, they or they should be observed for several hours for signs of labored breathing or altered mental status. Successful treatment for victims depends on a swift response and a quick diagnosis by trained medical personnel.
Often confused with secondary drowning is a condition called dry drowning. Although this condition has a number of causes, it can occur in a near-drowning incident, when the larynx closes to prevent the person from inhaling water or other fluids; this reflex action is known as a laryngospasm. Ordinarily, this laryngospasm should only last 30 to 60 seconds, but in the case of dry drowning, it can continue for several minutes. Meanwhile, the diaphragm drops, creating a partial vacuum in the lungs. Instead of drawing in a breath of outside air, however, this action pulls more oxygen-starved blood into the lungs.
Anyone who kept up with us at LEAD over the last year knows that we love a good celebration, especially in honor of 25-year anniversary (see: LEAD Technologies: 25 years of Imaging Excellence and 25 Projects in 25 Days: Celebrating LEADTOOLS' Depth of Features and Ease of Use). And today we join the world in celebrating the 25th birthday of Linux operating system!
Linux will turn 25 years old on August 25, the day Linus Torvalds sent out their fateful message asking for help with a new operating system. “I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things),” they wrote in the comp.os.minix message board. And the rest, as they say, is history.
History indeed. And LEADTOOLS has come a long way since we first expanded our reach with support for Linux back in 2000 (Version 12). With LEADTOOLS Imaging SDK Technology for Linux, programmers are able to add powerful imaging features to their Linux applications such as document viewing and conversion, OCR, Barcode, DICOM, compression, image processing, and more.
Not to re-gift or anything, but here's a sample Linux application one of our developer support agents did in honor of our 25th birthday: Linux OCR, Barcode and Format Conversion Batch Processor: 25 Projects in 25 Days. Happy Birthday Linux!
They have won nine playoff series and 46 postseason games since the start of the 2012 tournament, more series than anyone other than Chicago and Los Angeles and more games than anyone other than the Blackhawks. I respect the hell out of the Rangers for what they've done and how they've carried themselves over the last six years.
But enough.
Enough of playing the experience card.
Better to play with urgency, discipline and attention to detail.
Because the truth of the matter is that every single experience has ended the same way.
In defeat.
If experience were determinative, wouldn't it have been the Blueshirts, and not the Senators, to score a late third-period tie-breaking winner in Game 1? Wouldn't the Rangers have been able to close out Games 2 and 5 in which they held one-goal leads with under two minutes to play before losing each in overtime?
Maybe Alain Vigneault was simply engaging in a declaration of confidence in their veterans when the coach cited experience as a major factor in advance of Tuesday's potential elimination Game 6 against the Senators at the Garden.
see also The Rangers got what they deserved OTTAWA — A bounce or two went against them again,...
Maybe it would have been downright loco for them to dismiss that as a consideration when asked if all those games and all those situations this New York nucleus has confronted would be advantageous.
But all this talk about experience — and the 72 hours-plus between the end of Game 5 and the opening faceoff of Game 6 affords much time to talk — reminds me of the prelude to Game 7 of the 2015 conference finals against Tampa Bay, in which the Blueshirts' 6-0 record in such ultimate matches at home beginning in 2012 was recited as a mantra.
Lightning coach Jon Cooper shrugged it off while inviting the Rangers to bring it on when they said: “They have not done it against our group. That hasn't happened against us. Everything is in the past.”
Final score: Tampa Bay 2, Rangers 0.
One can imagine that is Ottawa coach Guy Boucher's message approaching this contest in which a victory would send their team to the conference finals for the first time since the 2007 Cup final defeat to Anaheim and for only the third time in the franchise's 25-year history.
This Game 6 is not about the past and it is not about the future, either, though defeat would be accompanied by consequences, of that there is no doubt. This Game 6 is about the present, about what the athletes are doing on the ice in real time, not what they might have done two, three or five years ago or might be able to do down the line.
Of course, this is an eminently winnable game for the Rangers, who have looked sharp in winning their last four at the Garden beginning with Game 4 of the first-round Montreal series. And this remains an eminently winnable series for the Blueshirts, who have been outplayed by the Senators only in brief bursts, but have not done enough to take charge when it has been theirs for the taking.
“I don't think we were bad in Game 5, I just don't think we were as sharp as we needed to be,” Derek Stepan told The Post. “I think we were average, and you can't be average at this time of year.
“We cannot afford to play that way again.”
The Rangers this series have been unable to duplicate the combination of emotion and execution they consistently reached over the final three games against the Canadiens. True, they dominated Games 3 and 4 of this round at MSG, but those were a pair of nolos contendere affairs in which the Senators' swords turned into plowshares within minutes of each match. The Senators are sure to present more of a threat in this one.
And while Vigneault can extol the virtues of their veterans' experience all they want, they must coach to the moment. Credit where credit is due, but there are no credit cards for elimination games. If Oscar Lindberg is the best center, then they must get commensurate ice time. If Michael Grabner continues to light it up, then No. 40 once and for all should get power-play time. If Jimmy Vesey plays with the same effectiveness and swagger as they did in Game 5, then Vigneault needs to ride the young man from Harvard. If Brady Skjei is outplaying their elders, then by all means, the coach needs to dole out heaps of ice time to the rookie.
This is about now, not last week and not three playoffs runs ago when the Blueshirts made it all the way to the Cup final.
Which they lost.
KOMO, the ABC affiliate in Seattle, notes the ticklish situation confronting gun owners who might like to try some newly legal marijuana after Washington's state-licensed pot stores begin opening next month: If they do so, they lose their Second Amendment rights. Or so says the Gun Control Act of 1968, which makes it illegal for an "unlawful user" of "any controlled substance" to own a gun. KOMO describes the case of Bobbi Jo Floyd, a Richland resident who was denied a handgun carry permit a few months ago because they were known to be a medical marijuana user. Floyd's experience illustrates what happens when increasingly open cannabis consumption collides with a federal gun restriction that until now has rarely been enforced.
Under federal law, cannabis consumers who possess firearms or ammunition are committing a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Likewise anyone who sells or otherwise transfers a gun to a person they know or has reasonable cause to believe is a cannabis consumer. There is also a penalty of up to a year in jail for falsely denying, on the form you have to fill out when you buy a gun from a federally licensed dealer, that you are "an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance."
Survey data indicate that something like 30 million Americans have consumed marijuana in the last year. Another 9 million or so have illegally consumed other controlled substances (which would include, e.g., taking a painkiller prescribed for a relative). Since people are not always candid when asked about illegal behavior, even in a confidential survey, the true numbers are probably somewhat higher. But conservatively we're talking about at least 15 percent of American adults who are officially disqualified from owning firearms because of the psychoactive substances they consume, with marijuana being by far the most popular.
Usually this rule has no practical effect. You lie on the form (or, in the case of a private transfer, do not fill out a form at all), and who's to know? But occasionally a gun owner's marijuana use (or a marijuana user's gun ownership) comes to the attention of a government official with the power to do something about it. That is what happened to Floyd, who in January applied to the Richland Police Department for a concealed pistol license (CPL). When they filled out the CPL application form, they said they were not "an unlawful user" of marijuana, since Washington has allowed cannabis consumption for medical purposes since 1998 (and for recreational purposes since 2012).
According to a 2011 directive from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), that was the wrong answer. In a letter to federally licensed firearm dealers, Arthur Herbert, the ATF's assistant director for enforcement programs and services, explained that "any person who uses or is addicted to marijuana, regardless of whether their or their State has passed legislation authorizing marijuana use for medicinal purposes, is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance."
Still, as long as no one knew that Floyd was a cannabis consumer, that fact would not have stopped them from obtaining a CPL. But someone did know. KOMO reports that a police department employee recognized Floyd, "an outspoken proponent of medical marijuana," and asked them to include a copy of their medical authorization with their application. A couple of weeks later, Floyd received a notice that their application had been rejected. Richland Police Chief Chris Skinner explained in a letter that under federal law Floyd is not even allowed to own a gun, let alone carry one in public. In effect, since it was Floyd's activism that tipped off the police, they lost their Second Amendment rights because they exercised their First Amendment rights. "I was incredibly angry because I was being honest," Floyd tells KOMO. "I had done nothing wrong."
Floyd has been talking to attorneys about challenging Skinner's decision in court. "I'm a Republican," they say, "and I believe in my guns." Medical marijuana patients in neighboring Oregon who were denied carry permits because of their cannabis consumption successfully pursued such a case all the way to the Oregon Supreme Court, which in 2011 ruled that the Gun Control Act does not pre-empt the state law that establishes the requirements for a permit. Those criteria do not include abstaining from marijuana, which Oregon recognizes as a medicine. In 2012 the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Jackson County Sheriff Michael Winters' appeal of that decision.
Unlike those Oregon patients, Floyd does not seem to have a very strong basis for challenging the rejection of their CPL application under state law. Washington, like Oregon, is a "shall issue" state, meaning gun owners can obtain carry permits as long as they meet certain objective criteria. But Washington's law, unlike Oregon's, disqualifies any applicant who is "prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal law." Hence the Washington State Department of Licensing lists marijuana use in the last year as grounds for rejecting an application.
What about a Second Amendment challenge? As Brian Doherty reported here a few months ago, a Nevada medical marijuana patient, Rowan Wilson, has so far been unsuccessful in arguing that the ban on gun ownership by cannabis consumers violates the Second Amendment. A federal judge rejected that argument in March, noting that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which includes Washington as well as Nevada, upheld that provision of the Gun Control Act in the 2011 case U.S. v. Dugan. Wilson's lawyer, who intends to appeal, argues that Dugan was weakly reasoned and should be reconsidered.
Meanwhile, Floyd and every other gun-owning cannabis consumer remain felons in the eyes of the federal government. That fact could be a source of serious mischief if Barack Obama or their successor adopts a more confrontational approach to state laws allowing medical or recreational use of marijuana. Even without a shift in federal policy, misguided state officials may force patients to choose between their medicine and their Second Amendment rights, as happened in Illinois this year before a public outcry forced a reversal. In that case, gun rights advocates united with drug policy refomers to oppose a requirement that medical marijuana patients turn in their guns. We will need more such alliances to make sure that the right to keep and bear arms does not disappear in a puff of pot smoke.
Saint Laurent
Founded in 1961, Yves Saint Laurent was the first couture house to introduce the concept of luxury ready-to-wear with the label's 1966 ‘Saint Laurent Rive Gauche' womenswear collection. The French house's debut prét-a-porter line set a standard of youth and freedom that represented a critical first step in the modernization of fashion and irrevocably transformed the socio-cultural landscape. Throughout the years, the house's pioneering styles, such as the iconic ‘le smoking' jacket, have become de facto cultural touchstones, with couturier Yves Saint Laurent securing a definitive reputation as one of the twentieth century's preeminent designers. The label's contemporary iteration, Saint Laurent, now under the creative direction of Anthony Vaccarello since April 2016, upholds its founder's legacy of absolute modernity and fashion authority. Opyum heels, Anja pumps, and Sac du Jour tote, are elevated to an unprecedented standard of luxury.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The former National Security Agency contractor who revealed the U.S. government's top-secret monitoring of Americans' phone and Internet data fought back against their critics on Monday, saying the government's “litany of lies” about the programs compelled them to act.
Edward Snowden told an online forum run by Britain's Guardian newspaper that they considered it an honor to be called a traitor by people like former Vice President Dick Cheney, and they urged President Barack Obama to “return to sanity” and roll back the surveillance effort.
Taking questions from readers and journalists, Snowden talked about their motivations and reaction to the debate raging about the damage or virtue of the leaks. Snowden remains in hiding, reportedly in Hong Kong.
Snowden said disillusionment with Obama contributed to their decision but there was no single event that led them to leak details about the vast monitoring of Americans' activity.
“It was seeing a continuing litany of lies from senior officials to Congress - and therefore the American people - and the realization that Congress ... wholly supported the lies,” said Snowden, who had worked at an NSA facility in Hawaii as an employee of contractor Booz Allen Hamilton before providing the details to the Guardian and Washington Post.
Snowden referred to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper's testimony to Congress in March that such a program did not exist, saying that seeing them “baldly lying to the public without repercussion is the evidence of a subverted democracy. The consent of the governed is not consent if it is not informed.”
The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into Snowden's actions, and U.S. officials promised last week to hold them accountable for the leaks.
Since Snowden went public in a video released by the Guardian on June 9, many U.S. lawmakers have condemned their actions and intelligence officials have said the leaks will compromise national security.
Some lawmakers have been more restrained. Republican Senator Rand Paul, a Tea Party favorite, has said they are reserving judgment about Snowden's methods, and separately encouraged Americans to be part of a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. government for the surveillance programs.
Snowden, who traveled to Hong Kong before details of the programs were published, has promised to stay in the China-ruled former British colony and fight extradition.
China made its first substantive comments on Monday regarding Snowden's revelations. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that Washington should explain its surveillance programs to the world, and they rejected a suggestion that Snowden was a spy for China.
Snowden said during the online forum on Monday that they do not believe they can get a fair trial in the United States.
“The U.S. government, just as they did with other whistleblowers, immediately and predictably destroyed any possibility of a fair trial at home, openly declaring me guilty of treason and that the disclosure of secret, criminal and even unconstitutional acts is an unforgivable crime. That's not justice,” they said.
Obama and administration officials have defended the program as an effective tool in its effort to protect Americans from terrorist attacks and said it was instrumental in helping to disrupt dozens of potential attacks.
General Keith Alexander, director of the NSA, will testify on Tuesday at a House of Representatives Intelligence Committee hearing on the programs.
Officials have promised to make public details on some of the thwarted attacks, and a U.S. government source familiar with the matter said more than 25 cases were on a list that spy agencies were trying to declassify for Tuesday's hearing.
During their question-and-answer session with Guardian readers, Snowden rejected criticism from defenders of the surveillance programs - including Cheney - that they were a traitor for leaking the details.
‘THE HIGHEST HONOR'
“Being called a traitor by Dick Cheney is the highest honor you can give an American, and the more panicked talk we hear from people like them ... the better off we all are,” Snowden said. Cheney was instrumental in the expansion of surveillance programs after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
Snowden said they had not had any contact with the Chinese government, and they took care not to reveal any U.S. operations against military targets.

“I pointed out where the NSA has hacked civilian infrastructure such as universities, hospitals and private businesses because it is dangerous,” they said.
Snowden answered about 18 questions on the Guardian's website during the session, which lasted more than 90 minutes and drew more than 2,000 comments and questions.
They said they were disappointed that many of Obama's campaign promises had not been realized.
“He closed the door on investigating systemic violations of law, deepened and expanded several abusive programs, and refused to spend the political capital to end the kind of human rights violations like we see in Guantanamo, where men still sit without charge,” Snowden said.
They also called on Obama to appoint a special committee to review the surveillance programs.
“This disclosure provides Obama an opportunity to appeal for a return to sanity, constitutional policy, and the rule of law rather than men,” they said.
“He still has plenty of time to go down in history as the President who looked into the abyss and stepped back, rather than leaping forward into it.”
Snowden said they were encouraged by the public debate over privacy rights and the limits of government that sprung up in the aftermath of the disclosures.
But now, they said, the media was more concerned with “what I said when I was 17 or what my girlfriend looks like rather than, say, the largest program of suspicionless surveillance in human history.”
Snowden's father, Lonnie, said in an interview on Fox News that they hoped their son would return to the United States to fight any potential criminal charges.
“I would like to see Ed come home and face this. I shared that with the government when I spoke with them. I love my son,” they told Fox, adding “I hope, I pray” that they do not commit any acts that could be considered treason.

“I sense that you're under much stress (from) what I've read recently, and (ask) that you not succumb to that stress ... and make a bad decision,” Lonnie Snowden said in an interview published on the channel's website.
They denied press reports that their son was a high school dropout, saying that after a lengthy illness at the start of their sophomore year, their son enrolled in community college and eventually got a high school equivalency degree.
MONKEY Mia has a cute new addition to its beach.
Piccolo - one of the favoured dolphins of the popular tourist spot - has given birth to a calf.
This is the first baby dolphin of the season to come in and say hi to the beach visiting group.
Last year, researchers claimed the playful family of dolphins at Monkey Mia are the smartest animals ever studied on the planet.

The group of scientists, led by US researcher Professor Richard Connor, said the dolphins there are the most “socially complex” animals known to man.
“No other animal ever studied has relationships that are more complex, and dolphins studied elsewhere around the world don't have relationships as complex as the dolphins at Monkey Mia,” Dr Connor, one of the leading researchers in the Shark Bay Dolphin Project, said.
Bottlenose dolphins have the biggest brains outside of humans based on body size, and they're already considered among the smartest animals because they have a complex “language” of clicks and whistles, can recognise themselves in mirrors and can learn to understand sign language.

Jazz FM has apologised after listeners were subjected to several “highly regrettable” minutes of the soundtrack to a gay porn film on Saturday night. The broadcasting regulator Ofcom told PinkNews.co.uk it is assessing whether the broadcast broke regulations.
The radio station, which has around 0.2% of the UK audience, ordinarily plays smooth jazz and jazz standards with occasional blues numbers.
But last night's Funky Sensation programme also included a few minutes of additional noises during music and adverts on the pre-recorded show.
The incident took place at 7.15pm and appeared to be a recording of two men in a mostly wordless but fairly graphic exchange.
A source at the station confirmed to PinkNews.co.uk the original recording did not contain the explicit audio.
As a result, many on the Twitter recommended a more suitable vowel than ‘a' for the station's name. Presumably, the rainbow chameleon remains appropriate.
JazzFM.com issued a statement, saying: “Unfortunately we had unauthorised access to the live feed this evening which resulted in a highly regrettable incident.
“Please accept our profound and sincere apologies for any offence that may have been caused.”
Mike Vitti, station programme director, said disciplinary action would follow.
A spokesperson for the broadcasting regulator Ofcom told PinkNews.co.uk that it has “received a small number of complaints and is currently assessing whether the broadcast broke the Broadcasting Code”. If found in breach, broadcasters can receive a fine or the loss of a license although this is thought highly unlikely in this case.
PinkNews.co.uk understands that a broadcast assistant was watching pornography while the recorded show was being broadcast and that they accidentally transmitted the audio of the porn through a microphone that had been left on.
For a decade, Focus on the Family has delved into what it believes is the biblical truth about sexual behavior through its “Love Won Out” conferences.
Focus says the conferences started a national conversation on the origins of homosexuality and have nurtured thousands of troubled families and helped hundreds of former gays and lesbians “escape the lifestyle.”
But pro-gay activists and many psychology experts denounce attempts to change people's sexual orientation through religious mediation or other so-called reparative therapies. They say it causes people great harm in an attempt to fix something that isn't broken.
The conservative Christian media ministry's 10th-anniversary conference is Saturday at its home base in Colorado Springs.
Although the program does not track the number of people who have made the decision to become ex-gays, Focus says more than 50,000 gay people and family members have attended 52 conferences around the country in the past decade.
“This is a struggle that can be overcome. A number of us have overcome,” said Melissa Fryrear, a self-identified ex-gay and director of Focus' Gender Issues Department.
“God can radically change your life, whatever the issue is,” said Fryrear, 42. “We're ministering to Christian families. They are devastated when a loved one is living homosexually. They can't condone what falls outside biblical truth.”
But opponents say the conferences also cause harm.
“These programs give us the tools and weapons to go to war against ourselves,” said Peterson Toscano, founder of the support group Beyond Ex-Gay.
Failed attempts to change sexual orientation take a tremendous toll on people's psychological, emotional, spiritual, financial and physical well-being, they said.
“I've talked to more than 1,000 exes- gay survivors whose lives have been devastated — their close relationships destroyed,” Toscano said. “Because of one of these conferences, my mother died feeling they had failed me.”
University of Minnesota researchers recently published a study in the Journal of Homosexuality showing that among homosexual men, the best predictor of poor mental and sexual health, including depression, drug use and sexually transmitted diseases, is a negative attitude toward homosexuality, not being a homosexual.
Focus on the Family founder and psychologist James Dobson has said that homosexuality is a disorder, despite the contrary opinion reached by the American Psychiatric Association in 1973.
Dobson also said there is no conclusive evidence that homosexuality is inherited, although they concede there might be a biological predisposition.
Dobson said there are more than 800 known former gay and lesbian individuals who have found “wholeness in their newfound heterosexuality.”
As evidence mounts for biological underpinnings to human sexual behavior, Christian conservatives increasingly argue science doesn't matter.
“Even if homosexuality is someday proven to be inborn, inborn does not necessarily mean normal, or divinely sanctioned,” “Love Won Out” conference speaker Joe Dallas wrote. “Surely we're not going to say that obesity, violence, alcoholism and adultery are legitimate because they were inherited.”
Christine Bakke, a 37-year-old Denver artist, moved to Colorado 10 years ago for the state's ex-gay programs and spent more than four years in two of them. They also underwent psychological counseling.
“I threw my whole heart and soul and life into changing,” they said. “There was a period of time when I actually believed I was changing. Then there would be reminders — oh, no, still gay.”
The whole time they suppressed their sexuality, their creativity disappeared.
They gave up transforming themselves into a heterosexual, they said, after observing many gay people leading happy, healthy, vibrant lives.
“I still had to deal with a lot of feelings of shame, brokenness and failure that I had internalized from the ex-gay programs,” Bakke said.
They no longer considers themselves a Christian.

This bundle is insanely amazing. You get two great games for free, especially The Last Of Us Remastered, which I think is a roller coaster ride that everyone needs to go in at least twice. The Last of us was game of the year in 2013 for most big Youtubers, and it deserved it. The story was so well written that it made me feel sad at some depressing points. The boss fights are creepy and challenging and a lot of fun. Also, Shadow of Mordor is a great game too. Talion is the star of the show here and they are a total badass. They can teleport, run fast, control minds, and slit hundreds of Uruk's throats. The Nemesis System is something that I have never seen and it adds a personal layer to the game, and it is a REAL innovation. Overall, this bundle is very solid and if anybody's looking to get a PS4, this is my number one choice for now. As for the comparison to the Xbox One Assassin's Creed Bundle, yes, it is 50 dollars cheaper, but the only great game you get with it is Black Flag. AC Unity was a bit boring and had tons of bugs and glitches at launch. I'm not a fanboy and I'm not trying to start any sort of master race or console war. If you love Xbox Live and all your friends are there and the Xbox One has the exclusives that you wanna play, then get the Xbox One. If you love PSN and all your friends are there and the PS4 has the exclusives that you wanna play, then get the PS4.
MORRISTOWN -- Authorities released the identity of the woman killed in a residential fire on Pine Street Monday night.
Kelly Smith, 31, a resident of one of the five apartments located at 15 Pine St., died during the fire, Morris County Prosecutor Fredric M. Knapp and Morristown Police Chief Peter Demnitz said in a news release.
At about 11:29 p.m., police and fire officials responded to a fire at the multiple-family dwelling, which had 11 people residing in it at the time, they said.
Smith's manner of death was determined to be accidental by the Morris County Medical Examiner's Office, Knapp and Demnitz said. They were found on the third floor of the building, according to Morris County Prosecutor's Office spokesperson Denise Arseneault.
The fire originated on the lower level of the residence, and it does not appear to be suspicious in nature, Knapp and Demnitz said. They also said they don't expect any criminal charges will be filed.
Authorities didn't indicate Smith's specific cause of death in the news release.
Seven people who lived in the building are receiving emergency assistance in the form of food and clothing from the American Red Cross, according to American Red Cross spokesperson Diane Concannon.

David Pocock is remorseful as they get set to sit out two rounds of Super Rugby following their first ban from the game for foul play.
Michael Leitch has revealed that David Pocock rang them twice to apologise for the "sleeper hold" tackle around the Chiefs backrower's neck.
Rugby's Mr Nice Guy and Wallabies star Pocock issued a heartfelt apology to Leitch and rugby in general after being banned for dangerous play.
Pocock, who champions human rights and environmental issues, was banned for two matches after the incident, which occurred in the Brumbies' Super Rugby clash with the Chiefs last weekend.
And Leitch has duly accepted their apology, with their head coach Dave Rennie revealing that the No 8 didn't want to press charges against Pocock, despite the dangerous nature of the tackle which left them laid out on the floor.

"David called me the day after the game to apologise and also again yesterday," Leitch said.
"His apology was very genuine and I wholeheartedly accept it. I wish them and their team all the best for the rest of the season."
Rennie was keen to play down the incident, after the Chiefs' brilliant 48-23 over the Brumbies in Canberra.
"I know they asked Michael Leitch to make some comment about it," Rennie said.
"He [Leitch] said they didn't want to press any charges. In the end I guess the judiciary had a decent look at it and made a decision. But certainly from Leitch's point of view, it wasn't major."
The usually squeaky clean Pocock pleaded guilty to breaching Law 10.4 (e) of playing a player without the ball but they were cleared of contravening Law 10.4 (m) of acting contrary to good sportsmanship in the Brumbies' loss to the Chiefs.
In a statement released on their website, and also through their social media platforms, Pocock said sorry to Leitch, their team-mates and "all those who follow rugby" for their actions, which they said were out of character.
The statement read: "Yesterday I faced the judiciary for the first time in my rugby career. I am incredibly disappointed with my actions.
"I endeavour to play the game I love in a way that reflects the kind of toughness and decency I think rugby can teach us.
"On Saturday night I did not live up to those standards, placing Michael Leitch in danger by binding on their neck in a maul. It was not my intention to hurt Michael, but in these sorts of circumstances it is not intention that matters.
"I am grateful that World Rugby and Sanzaar are concerned about making the game safer for all of us.
"I would like to take this opportunity to apologise again to Michael. And to apologise to the Chiefs, Brumbies and all those who follow rugby.
"I'd also like to apologise to my team-mates who I will let down over the next few weeks while suspended."
Pocock will miss crunch games against the Waratahs and Crusaders.

NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly Secrets of the NYPD Here's how a massive, taxpayer-funded public agency routinely ignores transparency laws
The New York Police Department has come under fire for the potentially unconstitutional execution of its stop-and-frisk policy, and surveillance of Muslims. But if you think that the taxpayer-funded agency should be accountable to the public and forthcoming about what it's doing, the story gets worse: It regularly flouts transparency laws, in an effort to make the records of how it performs its duties and the crimes it responds to next to impossible for the average citizen to obtain.
The NYPD's roughly 34,500 officers serve a population of 8.2 million people, but multiple interviews with reporters who cover the police department, as well as organizations dedicated to transparency, reveal a police department stunning in its disregard for the information requests of citizens, advocacy groups and news organizations.

The city's Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, who is running for mayor, recently released a report asserting that a third of all Freedom of Information records requests to the police department were ignored. The numbers are no surprise to journalists who cover the department, such as Leonard Levitt, a veteran cops reporter who now writes at NYPD Confidential.
“All I can tell you is that the NYPD does whatever it wants to regard FOI requests,” Levitt said. “Which means they never turn anything over, at least not to me. The only time they did respond was after I got the NY Civil Liberties Union involved.”
The civil liberties group filed suit on behalf of Levitt to obtain Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly's daily calendar. The department said the commissioner's whereabouts were secret for security reasons, which is a novel line of argument, given that President Barack Obama's daily schedule is public.
In the past several years, the NYCLU has also sued the department to get data on the notorious stop-and-frisk program, as well as details on the race of people shot by officers. The NYCLU, currently wrapped up in a court case against the city's stop-and-frisk program, was not available for comment.
Remapping the Debate, a public policy organization, filed a lawsuit against the NYPD in late April for withholding documents on protest permits. The group waited 11 months with no response before filing the suit.
“The documents sought are important to facilitating public understanding of how New York City has treated those seeking to exercise their First Amendment rights," Christopher Dunn, the associate director of the NYCLU, said in a statement. "Unfortunately, Remapping Debate's experience of having received no documents more than 10 months after the requests were made is all too typical of how the NYPD violates its Freedom of Information Law obligations.”

The New York Times sued the department in 2010 seeking records on pistol permits, bias incident data, the department's crime incident database and its FOIL logs.
“We started down this path because in our view the NYPD really had a practice of not complying with FOIL no matter what the request was,” New York Times assistant general counsel David McCraw said. “By and large, there is a disregard of the concept of openness and transparency. They do the minimal amount, they delay unnecessarily, and they fight over exemptions that reasonable people wouldn't fight over.”
The Times' suit has ping-ponged back and forth between the state's trial and appellate courts with various degrees of success. Its request for gun permit data was denied, but the NYPD settled out of court to release the FOIL logs.
"The FOIL system is broken,” McCraw said.

The result is many journalists on the crime beat in New York City don't even bother filing records requests. Reporters have to cultivate friendly sources within the department who will slip them documents. Not terribly unusual or burdensome for good reporters, but it effectively locks out everyone else.
"It's certainly become very difficult to even get routine records via FOIL from the Police Department," Village Voice reporter Graham Rayman said. "Requests are denied almost as a matter of course, and then news organizations face the issue of whether it's worth the money necessary to sue."
In 2010, Rayman wrote a five-part series for the Village Voice about an NYPD officer who faced retaliation from the department after blowing the whistle on extensive efforts by their superiors to juke the stats.

The Village Voice spent the next two years trying to obtain a report commissioned by Chief Kelly on the officer's claims. Its request was blocked, even though the report had been completed and was public record, according to state freedom of information law.
Back in October 2012, this reporter submitted a public records request for the discharge reports filed by NYPD officers over the previous year.
The impetus was the Empire State Building shooting, where it was reported that NYPD officers had wounded nine bystanders in a hail of gunfire intended to take down one gunman. (One of those bystanders, whose hip socket was crushed by an errant NYPD bullet, filed suit against the department earlier this year.)

I filed the public records request on Oct. 1. And then waited. On Jan. 11, I received this response:
In regard to your request, for all weapons discharge reports filled [sic] by officers between January 1, 2012 and September 26, 2012, I must deny access to these records on the basis of Public Officers Law section 87 (2)(g) and 87 (2)(e) as such records/information, if disclosed would reveal criminal investigative techniques or procedures, and or are intra-agency materials. Furthermore, these records are also exempt from disclosure as these records on the basis of Public Officers Law section 87 (2)(e) and Public Officers Law 87 (2)(a) in that such records consist of personell records of a Police Officer and are therefore exempt from disclosure under the provisions of Civil Rights Law section 50-a.
Now, stop and consider this for a second. The NYPD said the public interest of how, when and why its officers use deadly force against the citizens it's sworn to protect is outweighed by the need to protect the privacy of those same officers. Not only that, the public interest was outweighed by the need to protect its investigative techniques.
This wouldn't have been too surprising, if the denial didn't contradict previous court rulings on those same records. A New York judge ruled two years ago — in response to a NYCLU lawsuit, naturally — that discharge reports are subject to disclosure, do not violate officers' privacy and do not compromise the department's investigative techniques.
Earlier this year, NYPD officers shot 16-year-old Kimani Gray seven times — four in the front and three in the back — so I filed another request. Even though I used identical language as the previous one, the NYPD said I had not reasonably described the records and denied my request.

Robert Freeman, the executive director of the New York State Commission on Open Government, said he's seen a downward trend in the police department's compliance with public records law over the years.
“I've been here since 1974,” Freeman said. “The track record of the police department, particularly in the last decade, indicates in so many instances a failure to give effect to the spirit and letter of the freedom of information law.”
“I look back at various mayoral administrations, and my feeling is that there was more of an intent to comply with the law in the era of Mayor [Ed] Koch than there has been since,” Freeman continued. “My sense has been that the downward slope began in Giuliani's administration.”
There is little hope of reform from inside the police department or the Bloomberg administration. (For two years, the Bloomberg administration fought like a cornered raccoon to block a Village Voice intern's routine public records request.)

The department's Internal Affairs Bureau only investigates individual officer misconduct, not department-wide problems, and the mayor's Commission to Combat Police Corruption doesn't have power to subpoena police officers.
There are positive developments, however. The New York City Council recently passed a law requiring the NYPD to fork over its crime data, so the city can make interactive crime maps. Such maps are common in other cities.
“The reason I like it is because when you have crime data up, you know where to put your resources,” New York City Councilwoman Gale Brewer said. “You have a sense of what's going on in the neighborhood, not just the police department, but human services and the community.”
The measure sprang to life after journalists at Bronx newspaper the Norwood News complained that the local police precinct had abruptly stopped supplying crime statistics. The reporters had to file records requests for the stats, which of course were delayed or sometimes just ignored.

But is there any justification for the NYPD's poor performance when it comes to public records? Even open government advocates say the department's one FOIL office is dealing with a huge amount of requests, which coupled with a huge jurisdiction and bureaucracy, make any form of efficiency a formidable task.
“There is a degree of sympathy,” Freeman said. “The requests all go through the FOIL office at 1 Police Plaza,” Freeman said. “I can understand why in some instances it would be difficult to locate records in Staten Island or the Bronx. But I think the implementation could be improved by providing individuals at the precinct level the ability to make basic judgments.”
Improving digitization and electronic filing at the NYPD would help, too, Brewer and Freeman said. The NYPD was one of 18 city agencies in 2012 still using more than 1,000 typewriters, and not just as a hipster fashion statement.
“Typewriters,” Brewer said, exasperated. “We about had a heart attack.”

As one might have guessed, the NYPD did not respond to a request for comment.
On Saturday the mysterious DC Leaks website posted hacked documents from George Soros's Open Society.
The documents included information on operations in Latin America, Eurasia, Asia, the US, Europe and the World Bank.
One document revealed Soros paid $650,000 to the Black Lives Matter domestic terrorist movement.
Breitbart.com reported:
George Soros's Open Society Institute viewed the 2015 Baltimore unrest following the death of Freddie Gray as opening a “unique opportunity” to create “accountability” for the Baltimore police while aiding activists in reforming the city, according to hacked documents reviewed by Breitbart Jerusalem.
The documents further confirm that the Open Society last year approved $650,000 to “invest in technical assistance and support for the groups at the core of the burgeoning #BlackLivesMatter movement.”
The information was contained in a detailed 69-page Open Society report on the agenda of an Open Society U.S. Programs board meeting held in New York October 1 to October 2, 2015.
The report directly states the Open Society views the Baltimore unrest last year as a crisis that can be utilized to carry out the organization's agenda.
The document states:
The killing of Freddie Gray in April helped spawn weeks of peaceful protests by Baltimore residents and allies from the #BlackLivesMatter movement that were temporarily interrupted by a period of unrest that lasted less than 48 hours and resulted in some injuries and millions of dollars in property damage to neighborhood businesses. While many lamented the damage done, the overwhelming sentiment is that the uprising has catalyzed a paradigm shift in Baltimore that offers opportunities for major justice reforms. In particular, recent events offer a unique opportunity to accelerate the dismantling of structural inequality generated and maintained by local law enforcement and to engage residents who have historically been disenfranchised in Baltimore City in shaping and monitoring reform. Building on our existing networks and programs, OSI-Baltimore will focus investments on: 1) creating a culture of accountability for policing in Baltimore, recognizing the pervasive racism, disrespect and lawlessness that gave rise to recent events; and 2) building the capacity of activists in Baltimore to demand and achieve immediate and long-term reforms.
Later on, the document reveals the extent of Soros funding to the Black Lives Matter coalition:
Land for parks is so scarce in Manhattan that the city's most generous new green space, the High Line, occupies an elevated railway. Now three urbanist ­entrepreneursJames Ramsey, a satellite engineer turned architect; Dan Barasch, an executive at the social innovation network PopTech; and the pedigreed money manager R. Boykin Curry IVhope to mine roughly two acres of green space under the city streets.* Much as Joshua David and Robert Hammond transformed an old freight line into an attractive strip of greenery, this trio wants to convert the vast and dank trolley terminal that has sat disused on the Lower East Side for six decades into a park that they are calling Delancey Underground but will inevitably be known as the Low Line.
Technology enables us to create an appealing green space in an underserved neighborhood, says Ramsey. The key, they say, is the remote skylight, a system that channels sunlight along fiber-optic cables, filtering out harmful ultraviolet and infrared light but keeping the wavelengths used in photosynthesis. We're channeling sunlight the way they did in ancient Egyptian tombs, but in a supermodern way. Ramsey envisions a stand of dozens of lamppostlike solar collectors on the Delancey Street median, feeding a system of fixtures down below.
The MTA controls the terminal, where trolleys plying the Williamsburg Bridge looped back toward Brooklyn; Ramsey says the agency has been willing to listen to their pitch, though it won't contribute any funds. The next task is to sell the neighborhood on a park with walls and a ceiling supported by I beam. Community Board 3 gets its first look at the plan on September 21, giving residents the chance to start imagining what it might feel like to loll on a subterranean sheep meadow or ride an escalator to a bower in a burrow.
The price of the virtual currency bitcoin has jumped 35% in October to date, and on Monday traded at its the second-highest level ever.
Getty Images Bitcoin prices are approaching $200.
One bitcoin recently fetched $191.30 on the popular trading exchange Mt. Gox, which is the highest level on a closing basis since April 9's $230.04. The all-time closing high in April sparked talk of a bitcoin bubble — especially as prices subsequently tumbled to $68.49 a week later.
In comparison, gold futures have shed 0.84% this month and crude-oil futures have declined 2.8% in the same period. The euro has gained 1.1% against the dollar in October. A change of similar magnitude has been seen in Greek stocks, which are up 18% this month.
It\'s not so clear what\'s behind this latest surge in bitcoin prices. It could be that the risk of a technical U.S. default spurred some interest in bitcoin, which saw a price spike earlier this year amid a financial crisis in Cyprus. Momentum could also be coming from the closure of the bitcoin-only drug market Silk Road, which had given an unsavory flavor to the virtual currency. Either way, it will be interesting to see if bitcoin can make a run on its all-time high this year.

Generals Seek To Reverse Obama's Iraq Withdrawal Decision
By Gareth Porter
February 02, 2009 " IPS " -- -CENTCOM commander Gen. David Petraeus, supported by Defence Secretary Robert Gates, tried to convince President Barack Obama that they had to back down from their campaign pledge to withdraw all U.S. combat troops from Iraq within 18 months at an Oval Office meeting Jan. 21.
But Obama informed Gates, Petraeus and Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen that they aren't convinced and that they wanted Gates and the military leaders to come back quickly with a detailed 16-month plan, according to two sources who have talked with participants in the meeting.
Obama's decision to override Petraeus's recommendation has not ended the conflict between the president and senior military officers over troop withdrawal, however. There are indications that Petraeus and their allies in the military and the Pentagon, including Gen. Ray Odierno, now the top commander in Iraq, have already begun to try to pressure Obama to change their withdrawal policy.
A network of senior military officers is also reported to be preparing to support Petraeus and Odierno by mobilising public opinion against Obama's decision.
Petraeus was visibly unhappy when they left the Oval Office, according to one of the sources. A White House staffer present at the meeting was quoted by the source as saying, "Petraeus made the mistake of thinking they were still dealing with George Bush instead of with Barack Obama."
Petraeus, Gates and Odierno had hoped to sell Obama on a plan that they formulated in the final months of the Bush administration that aimed at getting around a key provision of the U.S.-Iraqi withdrawal agreement signed envisioned re-categorising large numbers of combat troops as support troops. That subterfuge was by the United States last November while ostensibly allowing Obama to deliver on their campaign promise.
Gates and Mullen had discussed the relabeling scheme with Obama as part of the Petraeus-Odierno plan for withdrawal they had presented to them in mid-December, according to a Dec. 18 New York Times story.
Obama decided against making any public reference to their order to the military to draft a detailed 16-month combat troop withdrawal policy, apparently so that they can announce their decision only after consulting with their field commanders and the Pentagon.
The first clear indication of the intention of Petraeus, Odierno and their allies to try to get Obama to amend their decision came on Jan. 29 when the New York Times published an interview with Odierno, ostensibly based on the premise that Obama had indicated that they were "open to alternatives".
The Times reported that Odierno had "developed a plan that would move slower than Mr. Obama's campaign timetable" and had suggested in an interview "it might take the rest of the year to determine exactly when United States forces could be drawn down significantly".
The opening argument by the Petraeus-Odierno faction against Obama's withdrawal policy was revealed the evening of the Jan. 21 meeting when retired Army Gen. Jack Keane, one of the authors of the Bush troop surge policy and a close political ally and mentor of Gen. Petraeus, appeared on the Lehrer News Hour to comment on Obama's pledge on Iraq combat troop withdrawal.
Keane, who had certainly been briefed by Petraeus on the outcome of the Oval Office meeting, argued that implementing such a withdrawal of combat troops would "increase the risk rather dramatically over the 16 months". They asserted that it would jeopardise the "stable political situation in Iraq" and called that risk "not acceptable".
The assertion that Obama's withdrawal policy threatens the gains allegedly won by the Bush surge and Petraeus's strategy in Iraq will apparently be the theme of the campaign that military opponents are now planning.
Keane, the Army Vice-Chief of Staff from 1999 to 2003, has ties to a network of active and retired four-star Army generals, and since Obama's Jan. 21 order on the 16-month withdrawal plan, some of the retired four-star generals in that network have begun discussing a campaign to blame Obama's troop withdrawal from Iraq for the ultimate collapse of the political "stability" that they expect to follow U.S. withdrawal, according to a military source familiar with the network's plans.
The source says the network, which includes senior active duty officers in the Pentagon, will begin making the argument to journalists covering the Pentagon that Obama's withdrawal policy risks an eventual collapse in Iraq. That would raise the political cost to Obama of sticking to their withdrawal policy.
If Obama does not change the policy, according to the source, they hope to have planted the seeds of a future political narrative blaming their withdrawal policy for the "collapse" they expect in an Iraq without U.S. troops.
That line seems likely to appeal to reporters covering the Iraq troop withdrawal issue. Ever since Obama's inauguration, media coverage of the issue has treated Obama' s 16-month withdrawal proposal as a concession to anti-war sentiment which will have to be adjusted to the "realities" as defined by the advice to Obama from Gates, Petreaus and Odierno.
Ever since they began working on the troop surge, Keane has been the central figure manipulating policy in order to keep as many U.S. troops in Iraq as possible. It was Keane who got Vice President Dick Cheney to push for Petraeus as top commander in Iraq in late 2006 when the existing commander, Gen. George W. Casey, did not support the troop surge.
It was Keane who protected Petraeus's interests in ensuring the maximum number of troops in Iraq against the efforts by other military leaders to accelerate troop withdrawal in 2007 and 2008. As Bob Woodward reported in "The War Within", Keane persuaded President George W. Bush to override the concerns of the Joint Chiefs of Staff about the stress of prolonged U.S. occupation of Iraq on the U.S. Army and Marine Corps as well its impact on the worsening situation in Afghanistan.
Bush agreed in September 2007 to guarantee that Petraeus would have as many troops as they needed for as long as wanted, according to Woodward's account.
Keane had also prevailed on Gates in April 2008 to make Petraeus the new commander of CENTCOM. Keane argued that keeping Petraeus in the field was the best insurance against a Democratic administration reversing the Bush policy toward Iraq.
Keane had operated on the assumption that a Democratic president would probably not take the political risk of rejecting Petraeus's recommendation on the pace of troop withdrawal from Iraq. Woodward quotes Keane as telling Gates, "Let's assume we have a Democratic administration and they want to pull this thing out quickly, and now they have to deal with General Petraeus and General Odierno. There will be a price to be paid to override them."
Obama told Petraeus in Baghdad last July that, if elected, they would regard the overall health of the U.S. Army and Marine Corps and the situation in Afghanistan as more important than Petraeus's obvious interest in maximising U.S. troop strength in Iraq, according to Time magazine's Joe Klein.
But judging from Petraeus's shock at Obama's Jan. 21 decision, they had not taken Obama's previous rejection of their arguments seriously. That miscalculation suggests that Petraeus had begun to accept Keane's assertion that a newly-elected Democratic president would not dare to override their policy recommendation on troops in Iraq.

Does it make a difference?
Truth be told, I never had a good impression about this book when I first saw it. In fact, upon its arrival at my home, the book had to kept under the covers and only read when there was solitude, partly because of the eye-catching color and fonts on the cover page. In many Indian households, the F word is still held as a taboo by the families. I myself was criticized by my mother for reading such books which “play around with the minds of the youth and spoil them.”
However, as soon as I started reading the first page of the book and continued into the book, my fears & apprehensions started to get dispelled. I realized what a gem of a book this is and that the Author, Shailendra Singh actually spoke some sense. Actually, they spoke my mind and talked about all those notions and ideas which have been present in my mind for the past 1-2 years now.
Before we move into the review of this book, I wish to warn the readers and offer my own disclaimer as well.
Read this book at your own risk. It is FULL of abuses, euphemisms, dirty language, detailed description of erotic stories and love making. Reader discretion is advised .
Having said that, let me make a point very clear and I know that the author will agree with me. This is definitely not about the abuses. It does not teach you how to abuse people. My personal request to all the readers of this book is to capture the essence of this book and not be distracted by all the abusive language. If you succeed in doing that, then this book is a gem and one meant for collection purposes.
Now, with the disclaimer out of the way, let's get into the book review.

The Externals
Nicole Sottung The cover has been designed by. One look at the cover tells the reader, that this book has been made keeping the youth in mind. The cover uses generous doses of bright, vibrant colors such as yellow, red and black fonts. These bright shades might be attributed to the brighter outlook towards life and career, which the book speaks about in its various chapters.
The spray can effect on the fonts both in the title of the book and in the author's name, in a way reaches out to the rebellious nature of today's young generation. The cover also includes small icons depicting a cricket bat, ice cream cone and most notably, a bottle of liquor. More on the significance of these icons later on in this review.

The Internals
The author dedicates their first published work to the Universe. The presence of a table of contents reveals that the book has been divided into chapters and headings but no numbering of these chapters. In this way, the author has come up with some really cool and wacky names for the different chapters.
The author gets into Author mode from the disclaimer page itself and the readers gets a peek into their witty and humorous side.
It is in the ‘ How to Read this book ‘ section, that my hunches about the cover picture turn out to be true. The author gives detailed suggestions on various methods and places where you could read this book and that too, enjoyably. The Author tops up their suggestions with the names of their favorite brand of Liquor. These suggestions explain the reason behind the Liquor bottle occupying the central spot on the front cover.
Basically, the book is a collection of the Author's experiences which they have collected through these years of existence. That's the reason why, they warn the audience in the Preface section that they do not have the answers to all the questions which plague the youth of today.
Reactions and Experiences
The book is a wonderful delight to read and the amount of lessons to be learnt from this book is enormous. The author makes use of short to very short sentences and easy to understand vocabulary, which underscore the importance of the message which he's trying to send across and the impact they wish to generate.
Throughout the book, they urge the readers to read the instructions and then keep the book down to actually perform the exercises or activity which they speak about.
The main objective of the author is to get their message across and inspire the youth to do things which they like doing, which their heart tells them to do.
Consider this thought on detachment,
“They say the key to enlightenment is detachment. Detaching oneself from desire and from the mind. Dissociating from mind-generated thoughts. Stop identifying with them, because they are not you. They are not your true essence. Your true essence has to become the watcher of those thoughts.”
On being a loser, the author says,
“If a kid doesn't aspire to be something that society deems ‘incredible', then they are already made to feel like a loser.”
On the thought of leaving behind,
“I guess I realized that, at the end of the day, I wanted my work to create more than profits. When the time for me to leave this world came, I wanted to leave behind more than balance sheets, bank accounts and receipts.”
On the thought of having options in life,
“In life, you get messages from up there, out there. You get signs to tell you there are doors and options open to you. But then, the call is yours. If you notice, you usually have two options in all circumstances, and you generally tend to pick the one that you are most comfortable with. Hardly anyone takes the path that is challenging and unknown. But the option is there.”
On the difference between being Rich and being Wealthy,
“In a way, I believe that it is the money that you have earned, that makes you ‘rich'. It is the money that you spend that makes you ‘wealthy'. Wealthy is the state of the mind that you get from using your riches for your enjoyment.”
The Hits
The book is full of personal experiences of the author which taught them a lot about life and now they pass on those treasures of learning to the youth of this age. I personally learnt a lot of new things from this book. Let me give you an example.
TIL (Today I Learned) that there are more neurons located in a 9-meter section of the gut (Enteric Nervous System) than are found in the spinal cord or the brain, combined. In fact, the Gut is usually referred to as the ‘ Second Brain ‘ of our body.
It's actually true and you can read up about this at the following links:
How the Gut's ‘second brain' influences mood and well being
Enteric Nervous System
The Misses
Well, apart from the usual typos and the high frequency of abusive words and obscene language, the book is a wonderful read. People who find such language offensive might find it difficult to go through the book. In fact, the author themselves suggests that the reader read through the book one chapter at a time, as the messages it contains might take some time to sink in. So, they urge the readers to think it through.
The Final Verdict
As a wrap-up to this review, all I can say is that- go for this book. There are many points at which you would feel inspired while reading this book and this should lift the spirits of many of you out there who're battling it out in their lives. This book will teach you how to follow your heart and your gut instincts -no matter what happens.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama said Thursday that the most important thing they could achieve as president would be to deal with Iraq and the threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan while improving "our influence around the world."
Sen. Barack Obama, in their first interview since the North Carolina and Indiana primaries, speaks with Wolf Blitzer.
In their first interview since the North Carolina and Indiana primaries, Obama said they think the United States' influence around the world has been diminishing.
"The world wants to see the United States lead. They've been disappointed and disillusioned over the last seven, eight years," they told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in an interview on "The Situation Room."
"I think there is still a sense everywhere I go that if the United States regains its sense of who it is and our values and our ideals, that we will continue to set the tone for a more peaceful and prosperous world." Watch the full interview with Obama »
Obama said they think the way the war in Iraq has been handled has kept the United States from focusing on key issues like energy policy, global warming and the economy.
Americans want to succeed, they said, "but we're going to have to make some investments and ensure that the dynamism and the innovation of the American people is released."
"It's very hard for us to do that when we're spending close to $200 billion a year in other countries, rebuilding those countries instead of focusing on making ourselves strong," they said.
Obama downplayed headlines and stories, such as the cover of Time magazine, that have declared them the Democratic presidential nominee.
"I don't want to be jinxed. We've still got some work to do," they said. Watch an analysis of some of Obama's comments »
Obama predicted that they and Sen. Hillary Clinton would probably split the remaining contests and said Clinton would win the upcoming primary in West Virginia by a "big margin."
Obama won North Carolina by a 14-point margin Tuesday. Clinton squeaked out a win in Indiana by 2 points.
In the days after those contests, some top Democrats have called on Clinton to step aside.
Obama deflected a question about a potential joint ticket with the New York senator, saying it's too early to start thinking about running mates.
"Sen. Clinton has shown themselves to be an extraordinary candidate. She's tireless, she's smart, she's capable, and so obviously she'd be on anybody's short list to be a potential vice presidential candidate," they said. "But it would be presumptuous of me at this point ... to somehow suggest that they should be my running mate." Watch viewer responses to question: Should Obama offer Clinton the No. 2 spot? »
Terry McAuliffe, a former Democratic National Committee chairperson and a co-chairperson of Clinton's campaign, commented Thursday on the possibility of a joint ticket.
"I think what she's interested in being the nominee of the party. ... We're fighting hard for it. This woman has been working tirelessly through this campaign. ... Hillary has earned the right to do whatever they want to do."
Obama said he's ready for what would be the next phase if they become the nominee: a matchup against Sen. John McCain, the presumptive GOP candidate.
Obama said they were offended when McCain said last month, "It's very clear who Hamas wants to be the next president."
"I think it's disappointing because John McCain always says, 'Well, I'm not going to run that kind of politics,' and then to engage in that kind of smear I think is unfortunate, particularly since my policy on Hamas has been no different than his," Obama said.
"And so for them to toss out comments like that, I think, is an example of them losing their bearings as they pursue this nomination."
When asked to respond to McCain supporters -- such as former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney -- who have said Obama is not ready to be commander in chief, the senator from Illinois said they think what people are looking for is "good judgment."
"I think I've consistently displayed the kind of judgment that the American people are looking for in the next president," they said. Watch Obama say why he's qualified to be president »
Romney responded later on "The Situation Room," saying "The truth of the matter is just as I said, that they don't have a record of accomplishments in the private sector or in the governmental sector ... hasn't pushed a major piece of legislation.
"He seems like a charming guy who's very well-spoken. But in terms of actually having led, actually having accomplished something, actually having a kind of leadership that America needs at a critical time with our economy ... he's untested. ... Frankly, Sen. McCain is someone who is tested and very proven," they added.
All About U.S. Presidential Election • Democratic Party
MOSCOW (Reuters) - A senior Russian official appealed to the West on Sunday to help prevent “neo-fascists” coming to power in Ukraine after a far-right leader said they planned to run for president.
Dmytro Yarosh, leader of the Right Sector paramilitary movement which played a big role in three months of protests that toppled Ukraine's Moscow-backed president, announced their candidacy for the May 25 election on Saturday.
“The de-facto authorities in Kiev and their Western backers should close the road to power of the neo-fascist Yarosh and their supporters,” Konstantin Dolgov, the Russian Foreign Ministry's human rights commissioner, said on Twitter.
Moscow has charged Yarosh with incitement to terrorism for allegedly suggesting a Chechen warlord should attack Russia after Russian forces took control of Ukraine's Crimea region.
Political analysts in Ukraine say Yarosh is a rank outsider in the election because of their ultra-nationalist views.
President Vladimir Putin has said that Ukraine's new leaders seized power in an unconstitutional armed coup and that Russia has the right to invade Ukraine to protect Russians living in the former Soviet republic.
Russian officials tar other protest leaders with the same brush as Yarosh, and portray the Ukrainian leadership as radical nationalists backed by the West. Russian state media have widely repeated the accusations.
Moscow also blames the protesters for clashes in which Ukraine's Health Ministry says about 100 people were killed.
The dead included police but witnesses said the vast majority were protesters killed when riot police charged or attacked them, and that some were killed by sniper bullets.
“The violence of the ultra-nationalists who have been enjoying impunity has completely discredited Maidan (the protest movement),” Dolgov said. “Militants guilty of murder should be brought to justice.”
Yarosh on Saturday described Moscow as the aggressor following Russian forces' intervention in Crimea and said Ukraine was “in a state of war with Russia”.
This June 30, 2017, remote camera image released by the U.S. Forest Service shows a female gray wolf and their mate with a pup born this year in the wilds of Lassen National Forest in Northern California. California wildlife officials said Wednesday, July 5, the female gray wolf and their mate have produced this one and at least two other pups this year in the wilds of Lassen County. (U.S. Forest Service via AP)
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A female gray wolf, their mate and at least three pups are the second pack of wolves spotted in Northern California since the species went extinct there in 1924, state wildlife officials said Wednesday.
The gray pups were born this spring in Lassen National Forest to a female wolf of unknown origins. Them mate is the son of OR7, a wolf with a tracking device that was the first of its kind in almost a century to migrate into California from Oregon, the Department of Fish and Wildlife said.
Biologists began surveying the Lassen National Forest area in May after they found evidence of wolf presence.
On June 30, they captured the 75-pound female gray wolf and fitted them with a tracking collar, the first wolf collared in California. An examination revealed they had recently given birth to pups.
A day later, Department of Fish and Wildlife biologists returned to the area for a follow-up check on the female and found that a nearby trail camera operated by the U.S. Forest Service had captured photos of the mother and pups. The gray pups were also photographed playing in front of the camera.
While most of the pack's known activity to date has been in western Lassen County, which is near the eastern state line, some tracks have also been confirmed in Plumas County, officials said.
These wolves, named the Lassen Pack by the U.S. Forest Service employee who first detected their location, are the second pack of gray wolves known to be in California since they were killed off in the 1920s, officials said.
The first confirmed breeding pair in California produced five pups in Siskiyou County in 2015. The family of seven gray wolves, known as the Shasta Pack, hasn't been spotted since May 2016, although one of the pups was detected in northwestern Nevada in November 2016, the department said.
Pamela Flick, California representative for Defenders of Wildlife, called finding a new pack of gray wolves in the state “momentous.”
“OR-7 proved that a wolf could make the trek to California. The Shasta Pack gave us hope for wolf packs here. Now the presence of the Lassen Pack shows that wolves are eager to return to their native territory in the Golden State,” Flick added.
State officials in 2014 granted the wolf protections under the state's endangered species act, despite opposition from hunting and livestock groups who fear the predator will kill deer and valuable cattle. Under California's protections, gray wolves can't be killed or hunted.
Wildlife officials said the tracking collar on the Lassen Pack's adult female could help minimize the friction with ranchers by learning the animal's survival, reproduction and prey preferences.
Gray wolves are also listed as endangered by the federal government.
The sixth and final season of Lost begins next month, but ABC may have plans to extend the series beyond its natural conclusion. Unwilling to let one of their most lucrative franchises go, the network is considering a spin-off.
For ABC and its parent company Disney, this is the only way out of their Catch-22. Part of what made Lost so successful and arguably revived it after a second season creative slump was the decision to set a definitive end date. Without that promise of eventual resolution, the show might never have grown into the eighth highest rated show of the 2008-09 television season.

But that success came with an expiration date, and ABC is reluctant to say goodbye to so successful a show. Although the more immediate plans for continuing Lost involve multimedia expansion, such as comics, games, special edition DVDs, and the much-rumored "Lost: The Ride", ABC executives ultimately see the franchise's future as being on TV.
An ABC executive explains the network's plans:
"We've been talking about this for a couple of years now," says ABC marketing exec VP Mike Benson. "We want to keep it alive but make sure we maintain the integrity of the franchise. We're not about milking this thing for all that it is right now; it's important to see this live for years to come."

Lost showrunners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse have made it clear that they want nothing to do with any spin-offs or continuations, but ABC executives seem to be prepared to move on without them:
"Damon and Carlton laid such groundwork, it's going to be a challenge for us, and we have to rise to the occasion," [executive Marla] Provencio says. "We have to find different, creative and innovative ways to keep the fans happy and to keep the franchise healthy."
Mike Benson compared ABC's plans for the Lost franchise to what Paramount has been able to do with Star Trek. Their goal is to maintain the basic premise and appeal of the show in new locations with a new cast, and this could be realized through both movies and a new TV show.

Honestly, the idea of a Lost spin-off, whether it's called Lost: The Next Generation, AfterLost, or (shudder) Lo2t, sounds like a bad parody of what shameless network executives would come up with, but here we are. Satire, you are once again obsolete.

Twiddle wrapped up their three-night run at New York City's Irving Plaza last night for some late night shenanigans after Phish at Madison Square Garden. Their NYC stand kicked off on Thursday night, when they were joined by fellow Vermonters and synth-pop aficionados Madalia for a special combined cover set dubbed “Twidalia.” Friday night brought the Giant Country Horns — the legendary horn section that has previously performed with Phish — to the late-night show. And on Saturday night, to close their run, Twiddle welcomed young guitar prodigy Brandon “Taz” Niederauer to perform throughout the night as a special guest.
Twiddle and Taz have shared the stage before, with their most recent performance at the PlayStation Theater in April. With such a past, the comfort zone invited Mihali Savoulidis and the young axe man to trade blistering riffs to the delight of the crowd.

I'm not surprised:
The weekly Welt am Sonntag, quoting a police report, said 35 percent of the 730,000 passengers checked by the scanners set off the alarm more than once despite being innocent.
The report said the machines were confused by several layers of clothing, boots, zip fasteners and even pleats, while in 10 percent of cases the passenger's posture set them off.
The police called for the scanners to be made less sensitive to movements and certain types of clothing and the software to be improved. They also said the US manufacturer L3 Communications should make them work faster.
In the wake of the 10-month trial which began on September 27 last year, German federal police see no interest in carrying out any more tests with the scanners until new more effective models become available, Welt am Sonntag said.

It's a matter of time, more when than if, until The Enquirer publishes the following story:
A bad guy with a gun enters a crowded place (mall, theater, church) and begins shooting. A good guy with a gun returns fire. A second good guy with gun, thinking the first good guy with a gun may be a bad guy, starts shooting, too. Perhaps, a third and forth good guys with gun arrive on the scene and with no way of knowing how this all started, they start shooting, too. Dozens are caught in the crossfire. By the time the police arrive, none of the witnesses is able to tell who fired first, who the bad guys are or who the good guys are.
There are no good answers to these mass shootings, but more guns in more places is one of the worst ones.

"I just decided I was going to win. So I pretty much just opened it up and poured it down my throat," Roche told ABC News. "Two hours later I was laying on the couch, shaking uncontrollably, nauseous, having fevers and panting."
According to doctors, Lehi managed to get the alcohol-free eggnog in their lungs, resulting in an infection.

"Birther " was in the running, so was "death panels," but in the end the New Oxford American Dictionary can only pick one word of the year. For 2009, it's "unfriend," says the Oxford University Press.
Or in New Oxfordspeak: "unfriend – verb – To remove someone as a 'friend' on a social networking site such as Facebook. As in, 'I decided to unfriend my roommate on Facebook after we had a fight.'"
"It has both currency and potential longevity," notes Christine Lindberg, Senior Lexicographer for Oxford's U.S. dictionary program. "In the online social networking context, its meaning is understood, so its adoption as a modern verb form makes this an interesting choice for Word of the Year."
Getting down into the lexicographic weeds, Lindeberg says "unfriend" is different from the norm in the use of "un."
"It assumes a verb sense of 'friend' that is really not used (at least not since maybe the 17th century!)," says Lindberg. "'Unfriend' has real lex-appeal."
Many of the words under consideration had tech roots, such as "sexting," the sending of sexually explicit text and pictures by cellphone.
Click here to read Crunchgears rather jaundiced view of the word-of-the year phenomenon, noting that the 2008 pick -- "hypermiling" -- "seems positively archaic now."
Update at 6 p.m. ET: The senior lexicographer at Oxford University Press, Christine Lindberg, tells NPR's All Things Considered that the OED lists a citation for "unfriend" from 1659, when the word meant essentially the same as it does today.
"I think it's a remarkable resurrection," they said. "In a way, I look at 'unfriend' as the 'Sleeping Beauty' of 2009 words."

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal agents on Tuesday raided the office of a federal whistle-blower protection agency and subpoenaed all 17 staffers, the FBI said.
The FBI seized computers belonging to agency chief Scott Bloch, sources say.
Law enforcement sources said agents seized computers belonging to Scott Bloch, the head of the Office of Special Counsel, an agency established in the 1970s to protect whistle-blowers and shield federal employees against improper management.
The sources said Bloch was the subject of a 2005 inquiry.
FBI spokesperson Richard Kolko provided no details of the raids, which also involved agents from the inspector-general's office of the Office of Personnel Management.
James Mitchell, a spokesperson of the Office of Special Counsel, said the agency was cooperating with investigators.
Bloch will remain on the job, and "nothing will change," they said.
"We do not yet know what this is about," they said. "Meanwhile, we are continuing to perform the independent mission of this office."
The U.S. attorney's office in Washington had no immediate comment on the investigation. But in December, the House Oversight and Government Reform committee asked Bloch to explain reports they hired an outside company to conduct a thorough erasure of files on a computer in their office and those of two top aides.
Bloch was already facing an investigation that began in 2005. A group that represents government whistle-blowers accused Bloch of obstructing justice, making false statements to Congress and retaliating against career employees they considered disloyal -- in one case, by attempting to transfer a dozen staffers to an office they sought to create in Detroit, Michigan.
"It is shocking that the individual who is primarily responsible for investigating federal whistleblower complaints would be the target of an investigation in which they and their staff are suspected of obstructing justice," Marshall Chriswell, a spokesperson for the National Whistleblowers Center, said in a statement. The group called on the Bush administration to fire Bloch.
President Bush picked Bloch for a five-year term as the agency's director, a post they took in 2004, but the agency has been at odds with the White House during their tenure.
In 2007, Bloch's staff began investigating whether top Bush political adviser Karl Rove and other White House officials had used federal agencies for partisan political activities. And they also began looking into whether any laws were violated in the 2006 firings of U.S. attorneys in at least eight cities, which sparked House and Senate investigations as well.
Investigators from the Office of Personnel Management's inspector-general and the FBI already had begun looking into Bloch's activities. The Government Accountability Project, another group that supports government whistle-blowers, has accused Bloch of wading into the controversies in order "to keep themselves in the public spotlight and protect against any efforts by the administration to hold them accountable."
Bloch is a former personnel lawyer who worked at the Justice Department's Faith-Based and Community Initiatives office before moving to the Office of Special Counsel.

Even as the FDA is considering approving genetically modified salmon for human consumption, there's another engineered creature that's stirring debate: The Enviropig — or, to critics, "Frankenswine." The animal's Canadian creators say it is less harmful to the environment than natural pigs, and would help farmers cut costs. Really? (Watch a CNN report on the pigs)
What is the Enviropig?
It's a pig that has been genetically engineered, by researchers at the University of Guelph in Canada, to better digest and process phosphorus.
Why would that be beneficial?
Pig manure is high in phytate, a plant form of phosphorous. When pig farmers use the manure as fertilizer, the phosphorous enters the watershed and causes huge algae blooms that choke the oxygen supply and create aquatic "deadzones."
How did scientists create the Enviropig?
They added an E. Coli bacteria gene and mouse DNA to a standard pig embryo. With this modification, the pig's phosphorous output is decreased by as much as 70 percent. The need for costly phosphorous food supplements is also negated, so the animals would, in theory, be cheaper to raise.
How many of these special swine are in existence?
A family of some 20 Enviropigs currently lives on University of Guelph property.
Will we be eating Enviropig bacon anytime soon?
Hard to say. A Canadian agency has approved production of the animals under "containment procedures," and they have been submitted to the FDA for approval. A spokesperson for the University of Guelph says "We suspect the FDA is more than halfway through the process of reviewing our application," but the agency will likely require additional information and research.
Are there any genetically altered animals at the supermarket now?
No. Genetically modified grains and produce have been for sale in North America since the early-'90s, but no such animal is currently approved for consumption — although the FDA is reportedly on the cusp of approving the AquAdvantage Salmon, which grows twice as fast as natural salmon.
Are there reasons to be cautious about Enviropigs?
Organic farming advocates say farming practices, not the pigs themselves, need to be altered. Opponents of genetic modification say we are opening a Pandora's Box by creating any such organism. "It's a completely novel cell invasion technology where we are crossing the boundaries of nature as no other generation has before," says Andrew Kimbrell, the director of the Center for Food Safety. "And the question is to whether that is safe, whether that is something that we should be doing ethically. Those are very serious questions that we as a society need to be asking."

Image caption Tolly Cobbold made beer on the site in Ipswich for more than 200 years
A hotel, 48 flats, a gym and a supermarket could be built on the site of a former Suffolk brewery.
The listed Cliff Brewery building in Ipswich was home to the Tolly Cobbold brewery from 1723 until 2002.
Plans for a £30m overhaul by Cliff Quay Development will be on display at the Brewery Tap pub, which is next to the building, on Tuesday.
Consultant Clive Thomson said the development could generate up to 400 jobs and could be completed by 2016.
"The scheme is intended to restore and preserve a prominent local landmark and bring it back into beneficial use," said Mr Thomson, who works for Woodhall Properties Ltd.
They said the development would also feature retail outlets and a "possible brewery-themed visitors centre and micro brewery".
Ipswich Borough Council rejected another developer's application to convert the building into housing in 2004.
Mr Thomson said they were confident that concerns raised then, including one about a nearby company using potentially hazardous materials, were no longer issues.

Multiple fake news purveyors -- many of which have served as propaganda outlets for President Donald Trump -- pushed a debunked claim that London residents chanted in support of Trump after the June 4 terrorist attack in the city.
On June 4, Trump rebuked London Mayor Sadiq Khan by falsely claiming that Khan said there was “no reason to be alarmed” after the attack in the city, and then attacked the “pathetic excuse” they said Khan offered for their statement. In fact, Khan had said that there was “no reason to be alarmed” about the increased police presence following the attack. Far-right figures and fringe outlets posted a video supposedly showing that “Londoners took the streets” after the attack and chanted Trump's name and said they “love” him. Fact-checking website Snopes debunked the claim, saying that the video “had nothing to do with” the attack, and instead was from a March “counter-protest at a much larger anti-racism rally in London.”
Nonetheless, multiple fake news purveyors -- which regularly function as pro-Trump propaganda outlets -- pushed the false allegation, and many appeared to publish their articles after Snopes had already debunked the claim. They claimed that the video came “the day after the attacks” and that it showed that not all Europeans “stand against Trump … regarding their Muslim ban” and made “it clears whose policies they prefer.” They also claimed that the video shows “that those who live in London are mad at” Khan, urged people to “notice: They weren't chanting their mayor's name,” and said the media are “ignoring this.”
Burr on Capitol Hill in 2015. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)
The N.C. senator was supposed to cruise to reelection. Now, no one's quite so sure.
Republicans are increasingly nervous about the Senate race in North Carolina, where Senator Richard Burr finds themselves at sea in a year when some party insiders say a perfect storm may be gathering for Tar Heel State Democrats.
Burr faces Deborah Ross, a former member of the North Carolina General Assembly, in a race that few Republicans even considered competitive several months ago. Ross was not a top recruit, entering the race only after other Democratic hopefuls passed, and Burr — the well-liked chairperson of the powerful Senate Intelligence Committee — seemed to have little to worry about. But with less than three months to go until election day, Burr has barely begun campaigning, and it's increasingly clear that their reelection is threatened by two forces beyond their control: Donald Trump and Pat McCrory, the unpopular Republican Governor who's also up for reelection this year.

“If it was a normal year, and it was just Richard and Deborah, you'd have to say Richard had a solid advantage,” says North Carolina GOP consultant Carter Wrenn. But 2016, of course, is not a normal year.
A Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released earlier this month found Ross leading Burr 46 percent to 44 percent among registered voters, raising eyebrows among some politicos who until then hadn't registered the race as competitive. “It's certainly not where we wanted to be three months away from the election: neck-and-neck in the polls,” says one North Carolina Republican.
Elsewhere in the poll was worse news for the North Carolina GOP: Hillary Clinton leads Trump 45 percent to 36 percent in the state, and maintains a nine-point edge among independent voters, who make up a growing and increasingly crucial voting bloc statewide. The lead reflects a brutal truth for state Republicans: Trump, many of them say, has virtually no organization in North Carolina. The Clinton campaign has made clear it is planning to invest serious resources. Clinton made their first joint campaign appearance with President Barack Obama in Charlotte last month; they and running mate Tim Kaine have both visited the state since.

“I think this is a Trump problem, not a Burr problem,” the North Carolina Republican says bluntly. “I think that this is a fixable problem for Richard — but it's a problem nonetheless.”
Burr's troubles may begin with Trump, but they don't end there. North Carolina also happens to be hosted to perhaps the most hotly contested gubernatorial race in the country, pitting McCrory, the enormously unpopular incumbent Republican, against Democrat Roy Cooper, the state's attorney general. McCrory has been badly damaged by a year spent defending HB-2, the controversial “bathroom bill,” which sparked an exodus of major corporations from the state after critics complained that it discriminated against transgender citizens. They trail Cooper by seven points in the WSJ/Marist poll. “The Republican brand is not popular in North Carolina,” a second North Carolina Republican acknowledges.
The state has not been easy terrain for either party in recent years, producing a series of neck-and-neck elections, and some Republicans scoff at the idea that anyone ever claimed Burr's reelection would be a cakewalk. But many are surprised to find their campaign in such a tough spot.

Burr has never had to run for Senate in a year like this — both of their previous races came in good years for Republicans, one of them against a mediocre opponent — and some GOP observers are frustrated that they are approaching the race as if nothing were different. For instance, they are not yet running ads, which, while unsurprising to Republicans who have followed their past campaigns and know they dislikes spending money much before Labor Day, is still causing some consternation.

“It makes me nervous,” says Wrenn. Burr's campaign spent only $2.1 million dollars total between January 2015 and the end of June 2016, according to FEC reports. By contrast, Ohio Senator Rob Portman spent $7.6 million in that same period in a state with similarly expensive media markets.
Ross is not yet on the air either. But they are also at a large financial disadvantage: they ended June with just $1.9 million in the bank compared to Burr's $6.9 million. Some Republicans are perplexed that Burr hasn't dipped into their comparatively sizable coffers to exploit their edge.
“I kind of am baffled by it,” says a third North Carolina Republican strategist, saying Burr “should have done the work to define them while there was a vacuum in the race.”
It's increasingly clear that their reelection is threatened by two forces beyond their control: Donald Trump and Pat McCrory.
What's more, Burr's obligations as Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee keep them out of the state more than some campaign-minded Republicans would like. Few Republicans fault them for that, of course. In fact, most see their position on a committee intimately involved in national security as something that will be a major boon to their campaign, once it gets moving. But in the meantime, their absence isn't soothing their nerves.
Burr's campaign pushes back on the idea that the late start is anything to be concerned about.

“Senator Burr is in a strong position to capitalize on the increased interest in the race as the campaign moves into the fall months and many voters begin to tune in for the first time,” says communications director Jesse Hunt. “Senator Burr's record of delivering real results for North Carolina is unmatched in the field. . . . This race will come down to who North Carolinians trust most to represent their views in the Senate despite Ross' desperate attempts to make it about anything else.”
Republicans are not yet writing Burr off. North Carolina is home to six military bases and a large number of veterans and military families, and Burr's position on the Intelligence Committee gives them an important say in many of the national-security issues that matter to those populations. Such issues helped boost now-Senator Thom Tillis at the tail end of their 2014 Senate bid against Kay Hagan, and Republicans say Burr's low-key style fits the ethos of the state well, giving them a good chance to reap the same benefits.
Ross was not a top recruit. Democrats tried unsuccessfully to convince several politicians with higher profiles — Hagan, Cooper, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx — to run first. And if she's not particularly well-known now, there's no shortage of attacks with which Republicans will try to define her: As a former director of the ACLU, they have a record of lobbying for positions that Republicans argue puts them very far to the left of the average North Carolina voter.

The ease of writing negative ads with which to attack Ross is one argument a number of Republicans have made in dismissing concerns about the race over the past few months. But the fact that there are things to attack Ross on doesn't matter unless someone actually launches the attack. Democrats acknowledge that they have vulnerabilities, but, they note, Republicans haven't done anything to exploit them. In fact, Ross is emerging from the summer almost entirely unscathed. Burr has not gone on the air yet, and only one Republican outside group — One Nation — is currently advertising in the state, with a generic spot rather than one tailored specifically to Ross.
“I think everybody's expected that to happen, for [Republicans] to really go after Deborah and paint them in a certain box. And the fact that we're in mid-August and that has not happened has strengthened their position greatly,” says North Carolina Democratic strategist Morgan Jackson. With state Republicans largely absent from the airwaves — and the contentious presidential and gubernatorial races ensuring minimal media coverage of the Senate campaign — Ross has had the leeway to “set their own tone” and “introduce themselves to voters, all on their own terms,” Jackson says.

Since late 2014 when Senate recruitment started in earnest, Democrats have made clear their strategy was to play to win even in the races that seemed patently unwinnable, so that they would be in position to take advantage of extraordinary circumstances should they arrive. And that is exactly what appears to be happening in North Carolina.
“The national environment has really put them in the position to win this race,” Jackson says. And just as important, Ross has put on a show of force that gives Democrats hope they can seize their chance, out-raising Burr in the first two fundraising quarters of 2016. “I think that has certainly upped their profile,” says Hagan, the former Democratic senator.
Ross's unexpected fundraising strength aside, though, the biggest issue for both sides is still likely to be the sheer size of the Senate map and the demands it places on the resources of outside groups and party committees.
“I think Richard's going to be ok if they get the kind of resources into this state [from outside groups] that it's going to take,” says the first North Carolina Republican. Burr's Intelligence Committee chairpersonship could help in that regard, bringing national-security-focused groups off the sideline. But it remains an open question whether Republican groups will choose to allocate resources to a race that they hadn't originally anticipated would require outside help. Republicans are defending incumbents in competitive races in nine states, and fighting to hold an open seat in Indiana and gain an open seat in Nevada. With so many places to spend, North Carolina may not be that high on the list.
Some state GOP operatives have concluded that it may not even matter: the national environment being what it is, the race could already be out of their hands.

“I'm thinking it certainly looks like a [Democratic] wave,” Wrenn says. “Maybe that wave just sort of passes and washes away. But on the other hand, maybe it comes ashore stronger than it is now.”

Members of the Kimbanguist Church in Portugal celebrating Christmas outside Lisbon , 25 May 2013. The church shifted observance of Christ's birth to the birthday of leader Salomon Dialungana, who is believed to be Christ reincarnated.
Kimbanguism is a new religious movement professed by the Church of Jesus Christ on Earth by Their special envoy Simon Kimbangu (French: Église de Jésus Christ sur la Terre par son envoyé spécial Simon Kimbangu) founded by Simon Kimbangu in the Belgian Congo (today the Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1921. It is considered a branch of Christianity. A large, independent African initiated church, it has an estimated 5.5 million believers and has its headquarters in Nkamba.
History [ edit ]
In April 1921, Kimbangu, a Baptist mission catechist, inaugurated a mass movement through their supposed miraculous healings and biblical teaching. The Belgian authorities treated the faith with suspicion and imprisoned Simon Kimbangu until their death in 1951. The church was formally recognised by the Belgian colonial authorities in 1959.
Some smaller, more loosely organised groups in Central Africa regard Kimbangu as God's prophet.
Life and works of Kimbangu [ edit ]
According to the church, Simon Kimbangu is said to have come down to earth from Mount Zion as a Congolese infant. Their father had been a traditional religious leader, but both parents died and Kimbangu was orphaned and put in the care of their maternal aunt. They took them to Baptist missionary school where they studied for many years. They grew up to be a Baptist.[citation needed]
In 1921, the mother of a deceased child is said to have approached Kimbangu while they were talking to their disciples. They said to her, "Have faith in Me. I will give you a miracle and you will know the truth about me. I will do something great for your daughter and you will see God's glory", and raised their child from the dead.[citation needed]
Beliefs and practices [ edit ]
The church eschews politics and embraces Puritan ethics, rejecting the use of violence, polygamy, magic and witchcraft, alcohol, tobacco, and dancing. Its worship is Baptist in form, though the Eucharist was not introduced until 1971.
The three key dates in the Kimbanguist calendar are 6 April (marking the date of the start of the ministry of healing), 25 May (marking Christmas,[1] falling on the birthday of Father Dialungana), and 12 October (Kimbangu's death anniversary). The church is largely non-sacramental, with large services that are well-organised.
The church also believes that Father Simon Kimbangu is the Holy Spirit,[citation needed] in accordance with John 14:15-17. Like many Christian groups, the Kimbanguists begin and end prayers with the Trinitarian formula.
Alongside Simon Kimbangu, the Trinity are Father Kisolokele (first son of Kimbangu) as God the Father, Father Salomon Diangani Dialungana (the reincarnated Jesus and second son of Kimbangu), Father Diangienda Kuntima (last son, reincarnation of Kimbangu and second human form of the Holy Spirit), and Father Simon Kimbangu Kiangani (grandson of Kimbangu, third human form of the Holy Spirit, and current spiritual leader of the Church since 2001).[citation needed]

TOPEKA — The Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission was gearing up Wednesday to launch a new website that officials hope will give people easier access to information about who is contributing to political campaigns and which candidates are receiving that money.
But Carol Williams, who heads the commission, conceded Wednesday that it won't address many of the concerns raised in a new national report that said most states have poor campaign finance websites that are confusing, difficult to navigate and often provide inaccurate information.
“The website home page, we believe, is going to be easier for people to navigate,” Williams said. “Once you hit ‘campaign finance' and go to the area, I think it's going to be a bit easier to get to the data that you need.”
But the data itself, Williams said, is still the same, composed mainly of scanned Portable Document Files, or “.pdf” images of paper forms, many of which are filled out by hand.
That makes them difficult for users to search and navigate, especially if they're looking for a particular donor to a candidate for governor or other statewide officeholder whose finance reports may be hundreds of pages long, or if they're trying to add up how many Democratic or Republican candidates one particular large corporation donated to.
In addition, Williams noted, in Kansas, the Governmental Ethics Commission isn't the agency responsible for collecting campaign finance reports. Those are filed with the secretary of state's office.
But the Ethics Commission is the agency charged with compiling those reports and making them available to the public.
Coincidentally, the new website was launched on the same day that the Washington-based Campaign Finance Institute issued a scathing report that said “most states fall far short of any reasonable standard” of providing citizens access to useful information.
“It takes too long for users to find the answers to simple questions, and the answers they give are as likely to be inaccurate as not,” the report said.
The results were based on a survey of roughly 1,900 people who were asked to visit the disclosure sites of five different states and perform a set of basic searches. Those individuals then rated their experiences.
The results for Kansas showed the state ranked about average among the 50 states for the length of time it took users to find the information they were seeking. And users rated Kansas slightly above average when asked how confident they were in the answers they obtained from the website.
But when asked to rate their overall experience with the website on a scale of one to five — with one being “awful” and five being “excellent” — Kansas came out at 2.41, slightly below the national average of 2.69.
Williams said to make the website truly accessible, the Kansas Legislature would need to pass a law requiring all candidates for state offices, as well as parties, major donors and political action committees to file their reports electronically.
Then, they said, the Secretary of State's office would need to agree to put those reports into a searchable database that could then be accessed over the internet.
“If we had mandatory electronic filing for all, I think then we could make a case to ask the secretary of state to spend their money to make it searchable,” Williams said. “It's really coming along well in lobbying (disclosure) in that, it's not searchable, but more and more people are doing it electronically. But with the (Kansas) Senate and House, it's still not even half.”

Former Arizona Coyotes forward John Scott explains the stress they went through when being traded to the Canadiens and subsequently demoted, as well as how they feel about being named All-Star captain and Barry Melrose's message to him. (3:06)
John Scott, as it turns out, is still headed to the NHL All-Star Game in Nashville.
The NHL announced Tuesday it decided to allow Scott to captain the Pacific Division team even though they got traded out of the conference.
"I am looking forward to enjoying a fun and unique experience at All-Star Weekend in Nashville with my family," Scott said in a statement released by the league. "While being voted to the All-Star Game by the fans was not something I expected to happen, I am excited to participate in the All-Star events with my fellow players."
The league's decision ends a tumultuous few days for the veteran NHL enforcer, who on Friday doubted their All-Star appearance after being traded from the Arizona Coyotes to the Montreal Canadiens and subsequently being demoted to AHL team St. John's. That came after some in NHL front offices questioned whether Scott and their five career goals deserved an All-Star berth at all.

Given that they had been voted in by fans as the Pacific Division captain in large part due to the Twitter movement #VoteJohnScott, it seemed perhaps unlikely they could still play because they were traded East and especially because they were now in the AHL.
But the fan reaction around the league spoke volumes, even if Scott themselves just wanted the controversy to go away.
"I've been getting people calling my hotel, calling my parents, calling my in-laws, trying to get anything out of me," Scott told ESPN.com on Tuesday morning while awaiting the league's decision. "I don't want to say anything, there's nothing to say. It's crazy."
The league finally made the "determination to maintain the status quo for the All-Star weekend in order to preserve all parties' pre-existing expectations, including Scott's desire to participate."
Still, the trade from the Coyotes on Friday disappointed him.
"Yeah, obviously," Scott said. "It's something I didn't expect. It came out of thin air for me. I had no idea I was going to get traded. But hey, it is what it is. I had a contract with the Coyotes, and they could trade me wherever they wanted. It's their decision. They wanted to make their team better, and that's what happened."
Scott also said they considered not going to the All-Star Game.
"I was just thinking, Do I even bother going?" they told TVA Sports. "Because it was such a messed-up situation. I'm definitely considering not going."
At this point it appears the Canadiens plan to keep Scott in the AHL, and they accept that.
"I think the plan is to just have me [in] St. John's and play with this team, and like any other player, if I warrant a call-up, so be it," Scott said. "It's back to square one in my career, I guess. I have to play and earn it and see what happens.''
It never crossed their mind not to report to St. John's after the trade.
"I'm making a lot of money playing hockey, why would I stop playing just because someone sent me to St. John's?" they said. "And besides, St. John's is a nice city. What are you going to do? Cry like a baby or work through it?''
So everyone takes a deep breath. John Scott is OK.
"Everything is fine. Stop the 'Free John Scott' stuff," Scott said, chuckling. "I'm free, I'm fine. I'm playing hockey, and I'm still alive."
Norwich City welcome Stoke to Carrow Road this Saturday with the aim of securing back-to-back wins following last weekend's 3-1 demolition of Sunderland. However, Norwich can expect that the side Mark Hughes brings to Norfolk will provide the sternest test of the season and will be going all out to ensure their first three points of the campaign. Stoke have recruited well over the summer and following the high-profile acquisition of Xherdan Shaqiri from Inter Milan – the Potters are well equipped to fire on all cylinders this season. Their squad now contains five Champions League winners with Marko Arnuatovic, Ibrahim Affelay, Bojan Krkic and Marc Muniesa joining Shaqiri as having won Europe's elite competition, which is more than Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal combined!
But, Alex Neil will be well aware of the quality Stoke possess and how their Norwich City side intend to counter it. A lot of the mainstream media was full of criticism of how poor Sunderland were against Norwich last weekend. However rather unsurprisingly, what they failed to mention was how well Norwich played and how they managed to exploit the weak Sunderland back line and how their passing moves for Steven Whittaker and Nathan Redmond's goals would make Barcelona proud. With the Canaries striker search continuing to prove futile, Cameron Jerome is expected to lead the line this weekend and faces another one of their former sides at Carrow Road following their appearance against Crystal Palace on the opening day.
Stoke narrowly lost to a late Liverpool goal in their first game of the season and fought back from 2-0 down to rescue a point against Tottenham last weekend so will see this game as the ideal opportunity to kick-start their season. Hughes has brought in as many as eight new players to the Britianna stadium and are no longer considered the ‘hoof' ball rugby side they once were under Tony Pulis. They have transformed from that ugly caterpillar into an amazing butterfly since Mark Hughes took charge and brought in top quality players as well as implementing a more attractive style of football. Should Norwich get a result against Stoke City on Saturday, it may just prove to the many doubters that the Canaries can cut it in the Premier League and have genuine survival aspirations.
Two mothers have been arrested in the landmark case against a Michigan doctor and two of their associates charged with performing female genital mutilation (FGM) on six girls, The Detroit News reported.
Prosecutors in the case say the doctor may have cut many as 100 girls.
The two mothers are not American citizens, but rather hold Indian passports and are part of the Dawoodi Bahra Muslim Indian community which is under investigation in the ongoing case. The two women, Farida Arif and Fatema Dahodwala, both from Oakland County, Michigan, were released on $10,000 unsecured bonds and must wear GPS bracelets.
They were to told to refrain from any contact with the other defendants, witnesses and victims, with the exception of their daughters.
The case began with the arrest of Jumana Nagarwala, an emergency room doctor from Northville, who allegedly cut the girls at a clinic in Livonia. The clinic is owned by Dr. Fakhruddin Attar from Farmington Hills and run by wife Dr. Farida Attar, both of whom are charged in the case.
Lawyers for the defendants plan to claim that no mutilation occurred, but rather what took place was a religious procedure. The lawyers will then invoke their clients' right to freedom of religion.
However, medical examinations showed the girls' genitals were significantly altered with entire parts of their genitals removed. Scar tissue and lacerations from healing were also observed.
The case, which marks the first prosecution for FGM in the U.S., began in February, when Nagarwala was accused of performing the procedure on two seven-year-old girls from Minnesota and covering up the crime. Since then, the investigation widened significantly.
The Detroit News reports that according to court records, members of the Dawoodi Bohra community who have spoken out against the procedure, it is performed to suppress female sexuality, reduce sexual pleasure and curb promiscuity.
Victims of the procedure from the community say it has left them scarred for life with a host of physical problems (especially having to do with the urinary system) and unable to have sexual pleasure.
The Dawoodi Bahra community generally performs Type I FGM, which involves the removal of the prepuce (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoris) with or without removal of the entire clitoris.
In the following video, members of the Dawoodi Bohra community speak out against FGM:

My regular readers know I'm a big fan of using low dose naltrexone for fibromyalgia. I recently had the opportunity to write about LDN and how it's becoming an emerging fibromyalgia treatment for Pain News Network. The story includes interviews with Jarred Younger, the researcher who conducted the first two LDN/fibromyalgia studies at Stanford University (more studies are on the way!), and Linda Elsegood, founder of the LDN Research Trust. I'm reprinting the story here with Pain News Network's permission.
The pain in Janice Hollander's legs was so excruciating that they wanted to cut them off. Diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 2013, she'd progressed through the normal litany of prescription drugs doled out by physicians – Lyrica, Cymbalta, gabapentin, muscle relaxers and narcotics – all without finding relief.
Then they happened to catch an episode of the Dr. Oz Show where a guest discussed using low-dose naltrexone (LDN) as a treatment for chronic pain. A few days later, they convinced their doctor to write a prescription and took their first dose of LDN.
“After about seven days, my pain lessened,” said Hollander of Michigan. “It lessened by 10 or 20 percent. That was huge! Even just that little bit of lessening was huge.”
After four weeks, the depression that had been stymying them for years lifted. At six weeks, they saw a noticeable increase in their energy levels. Them brain fog improved, and their memory returned.
Hollander has been taking LDN for about year now, and she's probably one of its biggest fans within the fibromyalgia community. They regularly share their success story in online support groups.
“I would say my leg pain is pretty much gone,” they said. “[LDN] has completely changed my life. I don't know that I would be here today if it wasn't for it. I don't think I could go for another year in the misery I was in.”
Hollander still has fibromyalgia symptoms, but they are more manageable thanks to LDN.
A growing number of fibromyalgia sufferers like Hollander are finding relief using LDN. It's an unusual discovery since LDN is best known in the addiction treatment community. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved LDN to treat addiction to certain opiate drugs in 1984.
Dr. Jarred Younger, who conducted two LDN/fibromyalgia studies at Stanford University, believes LDN has an anti-inflammatory effect on the brain.
“This is one of the few drugs that can do that in the brain because it crosses the blood-brain barrier,” Younger said.
In simple terms, the brain contains microglial cells that look for problems within the central nervous system. When they discover an abnormality, these cells release chemicals into the body that cause fatigue, pain, cognitive disturbances and other symptoms common among fibromyalgia patients. In a healthy person, these chemicals are intended to slow down the body, to force it to rest, so that it can heal from whatever has caused the abnormality. In fibromyalgia, some researchers hypothesize this normal central nervous system response gets activated and doesn't shut off.
“It's like the central nervous system thinks you have an infection when you don't,” Younger explained.
Fibromyalgia sufferers often speculate about what caused their condition, and researchers have debated various triggers for years. Viruses (herpes, Epstein Barr, etc.), chronic stress, genetics, obesity, aging and pollution are suspects, but according to Younger, it could be all of these.
They believe LDN works because it calms the microglial cells and reduces brain inflammation.
Penn State University researcher Ian Zagon posits a different mechanism behind LDN. Zagon's opioid blockade hypothesis surmises that LDN blocks the brain's opioid receptors, essentially tricking the body into increasing production of natural pain-suppressing chemicals.
Theoretically, both hypotheses could be correct.
Younger's two Stanford University studies showed LDN outperformed Lyrica, Cymbalta and Savella, the three drugs currently approved to treat fibromyalgia in the U.S., and it did so with minimal side effects. The most common side effects are headache, insomnia, vivid dreams and nausea – all of which usually disappear over time.
“Probably 65 percent of people get an appreciable decrease of symptoms,” Younger said.
But more research is needed to confirm these early findings.
Next year, Younger will conduct at least two LDN/fibromyalgia studies at their new facility, the Neuroinflammation, Pain and Fatigue Lab at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
One study will try to parse out the most effective dose of LDN for fibromyalgia. Most LDN users are prescribed the drug off-label, between 1.5mg and 4.5mg daily. But some rheumatologists have shared anecdotal accounts that certain patients respond better to higher doses, ranging up to 9mg.
A second trial will pair LDN with dextromethorphan, a common cough suppressant that's believed to work similarly to LDN.
But many fibromyalgia sufferers aren't waiting for the research. They've found ways to secure a prescription and try LDN for themselves.
Linda Elsegood, founder of the U.K.-based LDN Research Trust, has helped thousands of people gain access to LDN. They credit LDN with stabilizing their multiple sclerosis. At their worst, Elsegood was wheelchair bound, had no control of their bowels or bladder and had lost much of their sight and hearing. After 18 months on LDN, they were able to walk again on their own and had a reversal of most of their symptoms.
After their remarkable recovery, they wanted to educate others on the benefits of LDN.
“I wanted people to know that there is a choice, if you've been told, like me, that there's nothing else that can be done for you,” they said. “Look into LDN. Do your research. … It is amazing the number of people who've found LDN works for them for so many different conditions.”
In addition to fibromyalgia, early research has found LDN to be useful in reducing the symptoms of certain autoimmune and central nervous system conditions, including multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and others.
But few doctors know about LDN as an emerging treatment, so it can be difficult to get a prescription.
“Some doctors are too busy to read the information,” Elsegood explained. “Some will not think outside of the box. It's not what they learned in medical school, so they're not prepared to consider something that is alternative. Other doctors won't prescribe it because there aren't enough trials.”
Unfortunately, it's unlikely that any of the major drug companies will ever study LDN because it's an older, generic drug and little profit can be made from it. So it falls to innovative researchers, like Younger, who secure donations and grants to fund trials.
Patients often encounter doctors who refuse to prescribe LDN even though it has a proven safety record and a low risk of side effects. The LDN Research Trust includes a list of LDN-friendly doctors and pharmacies on its website. For those who can't find an LDN-friendly doctor locally, there are physicians who offer phone and online LDN consults.
“My advice is to always research it yourself, and then address it with your doctor,” Hollander said. “And if your doctor won't agree to letting you try it, then find a doctor who will.
“I would drive to Florida to get it if I had to. It makes that big of a difference. I just wish more doctors would prescribe it, and more people would find help with it.”

Speculation and pontification—not to mention about 400,000 preorders. That's the Tesla Model 3 in a nutshell.

Having the chance to spend some time with the car was akin to interviewing an infamously reclusive celebrity. Would it live up to the paparazzi's stratospheric expectations? In a great many regards, it did.
The Model 3's punchy torque (0-60 mph in 4.8 seconds) and laserlike handling impressed every judge who buckled in—though at the price of decidedly firm ride quality. The 310-mile range (from the up-level battery pack) is killer. However, the $60,000 price of the fully loaded long-range car put Jonny Lieberman in fits over this supposedly affordable EV.
Unlike in the past, Ratioless private torrent trackers are nothing revolutionary these days. However, launch of a new site of this genre always seem to spark the interest of our readers. SceneLinks (SCL) is one of the latest no ratio private torrent communities to hit the BitTorrent scene. It's not a niche tracker but a General/0Day tracker which tracks content ranging from movies, games to exclusive encodes and torrent packs. The site features an eye-catching user interface, claims to have scene access, has a bonus system based on ‘Promicin Shot' points and is home to an internal movie encoder group of its own named SLiNKS. Staff have expressed no desire to make this one of those super secret, l33t sites and SceneLinks has started off humbly with registrations open to all.
According to site staff, work on SceneLinks began several months ago. Although they are going public in mid January 2011, the site has been online since November 2010. To quote the words of one staff member:
The staff wanted to make a GOOD torrent tracker, before spreading the word, and so now you have a beautiful looking site ( my favorite stylesheet being Simple 2 ), with extremely fast scene axx pretimes, and ratioless. The site doesn't aim to become l33t or stuff like that.
They do claim to have scene access but there is no way for us to independently verify this claim. Either way, around 1500 torrents have been uploaded during the past one and a half months which is not a bad statistic at all. The style sheet, category icons and the overall visual interface of the site is indeed eye catching. Torrent index looks very organized with nuked releases, requests and free leech torrents easily distinguishable from one another. However, keep in mind that SCL still is a brand-new tracker – there aren't a lot of members or snatches so don't expect the same amount of activity as on TorrentLeech around here.
Just like most other ratioless trackers, a bonus system replaces global ratio on SceneLinks. Bonus points are called ‘Promicin Shots'. For every hour that you seed a torrent, you are awarded with 1 Promicin Shot. Of course, there are ways to earn points other than seeding:
uploading a new torrent = 10 shots
comment on torrent = 1 shot
saying thanks = 0.5 shots
making a post = 1 shot
starting a topic = 3 shots
seeding a torrent uploaded 1 week ago or bigger than 4Gb longer than 1 day will get you more Shots
Your SceneLinks account will gain certain abilities as you gather more Promicin Shots. A list of such abilities is quoted below:
ability to cast invites
ability to get upload credit
shadow ability aka custom title
heal/help ability aka give promicin gift
SCL administration have stated that they have no plans to make this a l33t tracker. Making a wise move, they have decided to open registrations for all during the start up period. If you are looking to be part of a new ratio free tracker, check this site out.

Sources: Man dies during physical altercation w/ Police , taser used but may not have hit deceased's body. They were pronounced @ local Hosp. — Annie McCormick (@6abcAnnie) January 19, 2017
A 55-year-old man has died following a bizarre and seemingly chaotic incident involving police officers in North Philadelphia.The incident happened around 5 a.m. Thursday on the 900 block of Poplar Street.Police were responding to a 911 call for a person screaming.Arriving officers found the man jumping up and down on their red pickup truck while screaming.An officer approached him.Police say that's when the man jumped off the truck and went to the driver's side of the patrol car, reached inside an open window, and grabbed a female officer by their neck and hair.There was a struggle and an officer struck the man with a baton. Another officer tasered him. Finally, they got them to the ground and got them handcuffed - then noticed they were unresponsive.Thinking they might be overdosing, the officers administered a dose of Narcan.Medics rushed them to Hahnemann University Hospital where they were pronounced dead."Stuff happens in this neighborhood all the time but for that, something like that. It's just, it's unfortunate," said Summer Woods of North Philadelphia.Hospital staff determined the taser never penetrated the suspect's clothing or skin, so it's unlikely the cause of their death.Internal affairs are investigating the incident.Action News is told an autopsy is likely to be completed Friday to determine a cause of death.One officer suffered minor injuries.
Today, agtech startup Indigo launched a probiotic-covered seed called Indigo Cotton, which promises to reduce how much water a cotton plant needs by harnessing the power of microbes. Indigo also closed a $100 million Series C funding round and announced it will launch its next microbe-enhanced seed Indigo Wheat later this year.
When we first heard about Indigo in February, it was promising to increase crop yields by replenishing the microbes that decades of industrial farming have stripped out of our most common crops. The Indigo team studied hundreds of plant species and employed machine learning to figure out which microbes found in heritage plants were missing from modern agricultural staples. Based on this, they developed a microbe seed coating and have claimed that in over four plantings, coated seeds yielded 10 percent more crop than uncoated seeds.
There's a real difference in root mass
Indigo Cotton is the startup's first commercial product and the company said it's already been planted across 50,000 acres in Texas and four surrounding states. Indigo CEO David Perry told The Verge that he's expecting around the same 10 percent yield increase seen in earlier trial plantings — assuming normal climate conditions — when the crops are harvested this fall.
"We're in these fields all the time and we're able to make comparisons," Perry says, referring to the prerelease planting. "You can see a real difference in stem diameters and root mass, which is an especially good predictor for a plant's ability to manage water stress."
The microbes covering Indigo Cotton are specifically chosen to help make the plants more resilient to that stress, Perry explained. Indigo plans to develop seed coatings that address issues like low nutrient stress, high salience stress, and threats like insect infestations. But Perry said they chose to tackle water first because agricultural water use is such a massive issue. Farmers currently consume 70 percent of the planet's fresh water. And studies show that if current trends continue, there will be a 50 percent jump in agricultural water usage by 2050. At the same time, global water consumption is already dangerously high.
A unique pricing model
Current agricultural technologies like GMOs and agrochemicals don't really address water use and water scarcity either. "There aren't any chemicals you spray on a plant to make it perform better when it doesn't have enough water," says Perry. Meanwhile, cotton is traditionally grown in drier areas of the planet, like the American South, which can have an impact come harvest time.
Tyler McClendon, president of Oxbow Agriculture, which operates 40,000 acres of farmland in Arkansas, told The Verge they believe Indigo Cotton has great potential to increase crop yields and address water scarcity. This past spring they partnered with Indigo and planted 1,000 acres of the microbe-enhanced seed.
"We ultimately feel that Indigo's ideas are good not only for the farmer, but for the bigger problem of feeding the world," says McClendon, "and as a business we would say that's our mission, to feed the world." While cotton can't feed anyone, Indigo's forthcoming product Indigo Wheat grows into a crop that can. Indigo is also developing solutions for corn and soybeans.
Beyond technology, McClendon was also attracted by the startup's unique pricing model. Perry said Indigo will charge a minimum for its seeds in exchange for a 33 percent share of any additional value that Indigo's crop creates for a farm. This means that Indigo makes a profit only when their seeds perform well, and it allows farmers to attempt to increase their yield using Indigo's product without taking on too much risk — something that McClendon said farmers are very wary to do.
Indigo Cotton will prove itself during the harvest this fall
Indigo's product and profit model have certainly attracted a lot of interest. This latest funding round was led by the $54 billion Alaska Permanent Fund, which pledged to match its investment in future financings. Perry said that the $100 million raised makes this round the largest private equity financing in the agricultural technology sector ever. That puts Indigo right in front of Climate Corp, which raised $50 million in 2012 and was subsequently bought by Monsanto for $930 million in 2013. Indigo will be using the cash to scale their operations in preparation for the launch of Indigo Wheat later this year.
Around the same time, Indigo Cotton will be proving itself during the fall harvest.
"The plants look very healthy," McClendon says, referring to their cotton crop at the moment. "But I would be the first to tell you that one of the key tenets of our business is we need facts and data. And I don't really care what the plants look like, I care whether they produce more crop at the end of the year."
Suspected Gacy Victim Found Alive
on October 26, 2011 in Serial Killers by Brian Combs
In my time studying serial murder, this may be the strangest story I've come across. According to the Daily Herald in suburban Chicago, a supposed John Wayne Gacy victim has been found alive.
Thirty-three years ago, then 19-year-old Harold Wayne Lovell told their family that they were heading to Aurora, IL for a construction job. They never returned, and the family came to believe that they had become a victim of John Wayne Gacy.
It wasn't an unreasonable belief.
Gacy often used offers of construction jobs to lure their victims, and Harold matched Gacy's Ideal Victim Type. Plus, a piece of jewelry was found among Gacy's victims that Harold's mother thought belonged to him.
What the family didn't know is that Harold had actually left due to a fight with their step-dad, and had moved to Florida. They had no idea their family thought they were dead, and as often happens in such situations, did not reach out to them, as they had not reached out to him.
Said Harold's younger sister Theresa Hasselberg:
They had no clue. They did nothing but cry when they found out.
With the word about DNA being collected from Gacy's victims, Theresa's son found a picture on the internet that they thought might be him. Theresa reached out to the man and it turned out it was their brother.
Theresa and their son live in Alabama. Within two hours of receiving the call from Theresa, Harold was on a bus to their home. They spent all day Tuesday catching up.
I expect this story gives Sherry Marino hope that their son might still be alive. I fear it's false hope, but perhaps I'm wrong.

Republican lawmakers who decry climate change legislation as catastrophic for American businesses were left in the lurch on Wednesday afternoon—by reps of American businesses. The split came at a hearing conducted by Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), chairperson of the powerful House energy and commerce committee, who has promised to deliver comprehensive climate change by Memorial Day. In March, they released a sweeping draft bill that received accolades from the environmental community and the Obama administration. Since January, they have held 41 days of hearings with 61 witnesses. This week, in a set of marathon hearings, Waxman will hear from 67 more.
Corporate America certainly sees the train coming down the tracks.
After top Obama administration officials appeared before Waxman's committee on Wednesday morning, voicing strong support for a bill that would boost renewable energy development, create green jobs, and reduce global warming emissions, a panel of corporate leaders were nearly as enthusiastic—even as committee Republicans blasted the legislation as a prescription for economic disaster.
While Rep. Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican, assailed the bill as “an assault on the middle class,” Meg McDonald, director of global issues for Alcoa, expressed their company's “support for comprehensive climate change legislation this year.” Climate change, they said, requires “immediate action” from “every sector of society.”
McDonald was echoed by Charles Holliday, chairperson and one-time CEO of DuPont. “I firmly believe this is an opportunity for American industry to reinvent itself,” they said. “We are fundamentally behind this approach.”
Jim Rogers, the CEO of Duke Energy, said, “I recognize that we are part of the problem.” Later, under questioning, they added, “We believe now is the time to act.” David Crane, the CEO of NRG Energy, said that their company has a “moral imperative” to reduce its emissions “substantially.”
With Waxman fast-tracking the climate change bill, these executives recognized that they cannot denounce the legislation and still hope to have any influence in shaping it. Instead, they have chosen to get on board, offering suggestions and mild criticisms. In their testimony, Holliday said they hoped that Congress would keep the cost of its final product “manageable.” McDonald said he'd like to see a cap-and-trade program that is engineered to “minimize the impact on the competitiveness of American business.” Crane argued for a commitment to clean coal.
The willingness of corporate America to engage with the Democrats left the Republicans without an expected ally. The Republicans' doom-and-gloom rhetoric did not match the sentiments of corporate America, which once largely stood with the GOP in opposition to congressional action on global warming.
Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), the ranking member of Waxman's committee, suggested that if anyone wants to experience what life in America would be like after the proposed bill reduces US greenhouse gas emissions to 83 percent below 2005 levels—Waxman's stated goal—they should go live in a low-emissions Nigeria. “I don't believe that humankind is the primary cause of climate change,” they said. “I do accept that CO2 levels are rising—I think it's debatable if that's a good thing or a bad thing.”
Republicans pushed for clean coal and nuclear power. They insisted that America cannot green itself without China and India committing to do the same, lest those countries poach business from the US. They warned that a cap-and-trade program would increase energy bills, impoverishing the middle class and harming American industry.
Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) repeatedly called cap-and-trade “cap and tax.” As in, “Cap and tax will essentially kick working families while they're down” and “cap and tax will devastate [the] US economy.” (That second Upton quote was the inch-high headline of a press release handed out by Upton's staff at the hearing.) In their opening statement, Upton encapsulated the Republican opposition, and highlighted how far their party's position has diverged from that of the business community. “If the objective is to send manufacturing jobs overseas, destroy the Midwest, mortgage our future, and hand over the keys to our superpower status,” they said, “then I say job well done.”
(Reuters) - Texas tycoon Sam Wyly engaged in “deceptive and fraudulent actions” in a years-long scheme to dodge taxes on more than $1 billion held in offshore trusts, a federal bankruptcy judge ruled on Tuesday.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Barbara Houser in Dallas ruled that there was “clear and convincing evidence” Wyly committed tax fraud, rejecting their arguments that they relied on professional advisers to vet the offshore system.
“The Court does not believe that the law permits Sam to hide behind others and claim not to have known what was going on around him,” Houser wrote.
The ruling followed a trial in which the Internal Revenue Service sought $1.43 billion in back taxes, penalties and interest from Wyly and $834.2 million from Caroline Wyly, the widow of their late brother Charles.
The IRS claimed the Wylys, through a scheme that dated back to 1992, used offshore trusts to avoid paying taxes on $1.1 billion while exercising stock options and warrants of four companies on whose boards the brothers sat.
While Houser found that Sam and Charles Wyly committed tax fraud, they ruled that Caroline “Dee” Wyly was innocent of wrongdoing and did not know the details of what was done offshore.
The judge directed the IRS and Sam Wyly's lawyers to attempt within 30 days to determine how much they should pay. If no agreement can be reached, Houser said both sides should submit proposals within 45 days.
Stewart Thomas, the Wyly family's general counsel, in a statement said while the Wylys were pleased Houser found Dee Wyly was innocent, “They are surprised and disagree with the court's fraud finding as to Sam and their brother Charles.”
The ruling came nearly a year after Sam Wyly and the estate of Charles Wyly were ordered to pay the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission $299.4 million for engaging in securities fraud through those same trusts.
In that case, a Manhattan jury in 2014 found the Wylys liable for scheming to hide $550 million in trading profits in the stocks of Sterling Software Inc, Michaels Stores Inc, Sterling Commerce Inc and Scottish Annuity & Life Holdings Ltd, now called Scottish Re Group Ltd (SKRUF.PK).
Following that verdict, Sam Wyly, who last appeared on Forbes' list of the 400 richest Americans in 2010 with a net worth of $1 billion, and Caroline Wyly filed for bankruptcy in October 2014. Charles Wyly died in a car crash in 2011.
The case is In re Samuel Evans Wyly, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-35043.
In response to a student's near-failing math grade, their parent took away their phone. But after the mom or dad posted a photo of the child's punishment on social media, an expert says the parent also took away their or their trustworthiness. (Photo: FistFullofCookies/Reddit).
When it comes to handling a child's poor grade, one family thinks they have the issue locked up. Redditor “FistFullofCookies” shared a photo in a Monday post with the headline, “My daughter is currently pulling a D- in math. This is their phone,” showing an iPhone mounted securely inside of a 3D frame. “In case of B,” reads a note underneath the phone, “break glass.”
STORY: Why Our Boys Are Falling Behind in School (and What We Can Do About It)
The image, posted in a “Funny” category thread on the social media site, pulled in a whopping 3 million views and more than 3,000 comments in just one day. Some praised the “creativity” of the punishment and others urged the parents to "figure out the reason why she's getting a poor grade in the first place.”
STORY: School Stops Giving Homework So Kids Can Play Instead
“I promise it's a matter of motivation,” the Redditor added in a follow-up remark. (The parent didn't immediately respond to Yahoo Parenting's request for comment). But parenting coach Sharon Silver tells Yahoo Parenting the move doesn't make the grade as far as effective incentive.
“Yes it's funny on social media,” says the author and founder of Proactive Parenting. “But it's probably not funny to the child that their mother or father is humiliating them online. Parents definitely need to help motivate their children but what this post does is make them bad grade a big joke.”
And that's a fail in terms of maintaining the bond between parent and child. “It breaches the trust factor in the relationship,” says Silver, adding that it turns a private family matter into a public spectacle. “And there's nothing in humiliation that is motivating to your child.”
Motivation, they add, just isn't something that mom or dad can force a child to feel. “Parents need to understand that motivation is something created internally, something self-driven. Exterior motivation at teenagers' age will most likely always backfire.”
So how do you help spark incentive to study in a kid who's clearly having trouble? “When teens hold responsibility for their own future, all of a sudden they become pretty motivated,” they say.
Taking away their cell phone, in and of itself, isn't a bad idea. “Unless the child pays for their phone herself, it belongs to the parents and they can say, ‘I don't pay for phones for grades under B,'” they say. “'If you need help extra tutoring I will support you. What do you need?'”
Silver advises parents facing this problem to find out why the child thinks good grades aren't important, if they aren't taking the situation seriously, and to make sure they understand what effect this will have later on. “Just ask the child what kind of life do you plan to provide for yourself with a failing grade?” they say. “Even if they don't have an answer, it puts in their mind that this is serious.”
By airing the situation on social media you're shutting down the conversation and any cooperation, Silver adds. “It becomes, ‘You humiliated me, I'm not going to listen to you,' and now you really have rebellion on your hands.”

In China, reporters covering Biden get the heave-ho
Only minutes into the vice president's remarks, Chinese officials began directing journalists toward the exits. Soon the shooing became shoving.
Xi spoke first, calling Biden's visit a "major event" in the U.S.-China relationship and expressing their desire to work with America "to promote development of relations between our great nations."
Biden's schedule Thursday, their first full day in China, included two bilateral meetings with Chinese Vice President Xi Jingping. American and Chinese press were to be allowed in to hear the opening remarks at the start of the first, expanded meeting.
At the senior levels, the American and Chinese delegations actually seem to be getting along quite well. But relations between the press and staff traveling with the vice president and Chinese officials guarding access to the leaders are another story entirely.
Reporting from Beijing — Vice President Joe Biden's famously loquacious style has now become the source of some international tension.
Then Biden spoke, starting with a reference to their first visit to China in 1979, when they saw "the great wonders" of the nation. They spoke of their admiration for the Chinese people and the "great sweep of history." And to Xi, they spoke of the importance of developing a close personal relationship, one of "openness and candor," and stated their belief that foreign policy "is more than just formal visits, it's establishing relationships and trust."
"It is my fond hope that our personal relationship will continue to grow," Biden said to Xi, who is widely expected to be the next Chinese president.
It was right about this time that a near-brawl was breaking out about a hundred feet away from the diplomatic exchanges in the Eastern Hall of the Great Hall of the People.
Only minutes into Biden's remarks, Chinese officials had begun to direct reporters toward the exits. Most reporters and the vice president's staff objected, saying it was important to cover the entirety of Biden's opening statement, as had been the agreement between officials beforehand.
A Chinese press aide said Biden was going on far too long for their liking. But in fact, including the consecutive translation of their comments from English to Chinese, Biden spoke only two or three minutes longer than Xi had.
Soon the stern shooing turned into forceful shoving. As reporters tried to stand their ground, Chinese officials locked arms and pushed forward in a show of overwhelming force. Soon enough Biden did finish, but reporters had difficulty hearing the entire thing because of the fisticuffs.
Hours later, Biden held another meeting with the chair of the National People's Congress, Wu Bangguo. And again, Chinese officials attempted to force reporters from the room even as Biden was still speaking.
Though there would not be the kind of physical interaction as in the earlier meeting, the vice president's staff was not pleased with their Chinese counterparts, who they felt were showing disrespect to the office and to the country.
That's not to say the display was unexpected. In fact, reporters had been warned beforehand about the potentially over-aggressive conduct. But some more veteran members of the American press and staff said it went further than they'd seen in the past.
Friday will provide another test of the press corps' muscle when Biden is to meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao.
The Fijian Drua are officially the National Rugby Championship team to beat in 2017, after their comprehensive 41-5 win over defending title-holders Perth Spirit in Fiji.
The home side were outstanding in defence, not letting Perth Spirit into the game until the 70th minute, ensuring the capacity crowd at the National Stadium in Suva were at their vocal best all match.
“We're a well organised team, a disciplined team. We had to stand on our ground, keep working hard, and I was very proud of the boys, especially the discipline,” a very satisfied Fijian Drua skipper John Stewart said immediately after the match.
“We were talking all week about our defence. We had to improve it 150%, because only that can win us the game. We are a structured team, and we had to make our tackles, and full credit to the boys for working so hard in defence”
“We spoke at the start of the year, and we don't just want to make up the numbers [in the NRC]. We want to compete, and we won't rest here. This is just the beginning,” Stewart said.
“We'll keep working hard, and try and go as far as we can.”

RESULT
It took nineteen minutes for the first points of the match, as both sides worked their way into what was already a really physical match.Lock Peni Naulago was held up, and from a scrum soon after in which the Drua pack looked tryline bound, scrumhalf Frank Lomani picked it up for a short blindside dart for the corner.Fullback Apisalome Waqatabu couldn't convert, but they scored under the posts themselves only minutes later, running onto a perfect Eroni Vasiteri offload that should be taught in schools.Perth found themselves behind the posts again in the 26th minute, after Lomani toed ahead a loose ball, only to be brought down just short of the line. No.8 Peni Raidre won the clean-out and dived over to score next to the posts.Perth Spirit didn't necessarily do a lot wrong in the first thirty minutes of the game, but once they found themselves well behind on the scoreboard, the mistakes quickly mounted as they attempted to play catch-up. It became self-fulfilling in the end; the harder they tried to get back into the game, the more mistakes they made.The home side had the last say in the first half when Stewart scored in the corner after a wonderful scrum play back near the 40-metre line. Waqatabu couldn't convert, but the home side went to break leading 24-0.A 51st minute penalty from Waqatabu opened the scoring in the second half, pushing the home side out to what already looked an insurmountable 27-0 lead, and it was made all the stronger soon after when big lock Filimoni Seru crashed over minutes later.drua-win-over-spiritSpirit no.8 Isi Naisarani was again one of their side's best, but their consolation try didn't really add any respectability to the margin.Stewart crossed late in the game to complete their double and confirm the final score, kicking off the party in true Fiji style.

Despite the attempt to marginalize the concept, “false flags” are so common that U.S. officials frequently use that phrase.
For example, Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, former chief of staff to Colin Powell:
Former Director for Transnational Threats on the U.S. National Security Council, Roger Cressey:
Former CIA counterterrorism official Philip Mudd:
Lieutenant General Thomas McInerney, a high ranking Air Force official:
Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations (and Neocon warmonger) John Bolton:
The Washington Post notes that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld approved as an acceptable interrogation method
A technique known as “false flag,” or deceiving a detainee into believing they are being interrogated by someone from another country.
NBC News points out:
In another document taken from the NSA by Snowden and obtained by NBC News, a JTRIG official said the unit's mission included computer network attacks, disruption, “Active Covert Internet Operations,” and “Covert Technical Operations.” Among the methods listed in the document were jamming phones, computers and email accounts and masquerading as an enemy in a “false flag” operation. The same document said GCHQ was increasing its emphasis on using cyber tools to attack adversaries.
Washington's Blog asked high-level NSA official Bill Binney* if they had heard of the term “false flags” when they were with the NSA.
Binney responded:
Sure, they were under deception and manipulation programs. I was not involved in doing them; but, I did have to figure out some that the other side was doing. The other side called them “dezsinformatsiya” and Manipulatsiya.” The Brits have been doing this for several hundred years and are quite good at it.
Washington's Blog asked Philip Giraldi – a former counter-terrorism specialist and military intelligence officer with the CIA – the same question with regards to their experience with the CIA.
Giraldi responded:
Yes, of course. We did false flags, and called them that, frequently in the operations directorate using false documentation to indicated that we were nationals of a country that was not the United States. Almost every CIA officer had false third country identification when operating overseas….
We followed up by asking:
Is it fair to say some of the false flags were for the purpose (i.e. premeditated) of blaming another country or group … not only just in case caught?
Giraldi replied:
Sometimes if it were a covert action attempting to do just that but more often just for cover reasons to make one appear to not be American…
Robert David Steele – a 20-year Marine Corps infantry and intelligence officer, the second-ranking civilian in U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence, and former CIA clandestine services case officer – said:
Most terrorists are false flag terrorists or are created by our own security services. *** In the United States, every single terrorist incident we have had has been a false flag, or has been an informant pushed on by the FBI.
Steele has repeatedly and publicly said (and also confirmed to Washington's Blog) that they personally carried out a “false flag” attack while working as a U.S. intelligence officer.
Indeed, false flags are so common that there are official rules of engagement prohibiting false flags in naval, air and land warfare.

With reports circling regarding Jason Kreis being fired as New York City FC's head coach after just one season in charge and rookie boss Patrick Vieria replacing him, many in Major League Soccer find it hard to believe.

Sure, Kreis and their coaching staff haven't enjoyed a stellar season with expansion franchise NYCFC finishing out of the playoffs in year one, but with Frank Lampard, David Villa and Andrea Pirlo now having plenty of MLS experience under their belt (which is a whole different world to their time spent playing in Europe over the past two decades), plus the latter two only arriving midway through the season, you have to think better times will arrive in the near future.
A source close to the situation has confirmed to ProSoccerTalk that reports regarding Kreis being fired by NYCFC have come as a total surprise to individuals at the organization but admitted that after a disappointing debut season in MLS, there is plenty to be discussed at the end of the season.
It is believed that Kreis will sit down with NYCFC's leading officials, such as sporting director Claudio Reyna, club president Tom Glick and chief executive Ferran Sorriano, in the coming weeks after the MLS season is over. The point of that meeting will be a post-season briefing to assess which things went well, which things didn't, and to plan for the offseason and the 2016 season. Only then will it become clear if Kreis' time at NYCFC is up.

For what it's worth, the City Football Group (CFG), who own NYCFC, implement a similar end of season review at sister club Manchester City after every season which always leads to speculation regarding the hiring or a new manager of firing of the current man in charge. With Vieria currently in charge of Man City's reserve team, the former Arsenal and French international midfielder has been touted to take plenty of head coaching jobs in the Premier League in the past and it is no secret that they have ambitions to become a head coach somewhere, soon. Linking Vieria with a position at City is not far fetched as CFG would seem to be promoting from within.
New York City FC's debut season in MLS will come to a close on Sunday as they host the New England Revolution at Yankee Stadium during MLS “Decision Day” with Kreis' side set to finish in eighth place in the Eastern Conference. You can point to many things for NYCFC not living up to the preseason hype but in truth, it is always tough for an expansion franchise in MLS. The likes of Vancouver, Montreal, Portland and up until recently, Toronto, have all struggled to find their feet and compete with MLS originals from day one. And let's not forget, NYCFC had to build an entire club from scratch and Kreis was a key cog in making all of that possible. They deserve more time to turn this team into one which challenges for a place in the playoffs and for trophies.
Lessons will have to be learned if things are going to improve but is firing Kreis, the man who built Real Salt Lake into an MLS powerhouse after putting in years of hard work behind-the-scenes, really the right answer?
If you fancy reading more about Kreis' mission as NYCFC boss, here's our extensive Q&A with them from before the season and a longform piece on NYCFC's preparations as they had high hopes when entering into MLS. Here's what Kreis said before the season when speaking about the owner of CFG, Sheikh Mansour, showing patience with their head coaches in the past.
“I believe that if we do the right things and show that we have a plan, as we have already really started from a year ago, showing that we have a very set plan and that we are moving things forward in a positive direction. I believe the people here who are in the decision making positions are very soccer savvy,” Kreis said. “They understand that this is probably not going to happen overnight. I believe that we are going to be afforded the opportunity to get it right over a period of time. But the one thing I need to show is that we are moving in the right direction.”
Those hopes and dreams have not been realized but replacing Kreis with a man who has never played or coached in MLS and has never had a head coaching job does seem like a pretty drastic decision to make.

The green light has been given for what will be Scotland's largest solar farm.
Moray Council has granted Elgin Energy planning permission for a 20MW project near Urquhart, which could see about 80,000 solar panels installed.
The farm will be constructed on the 47-hectare Speyslaw site - the equivalent of about 40 football pitches.
The largest Scottish solar farm is currently a 13MW project at Errol Estate in Perthshire, which went live in May last year.
Bristol-based Elgin Energy also developed that scheme, which includes 55,000 solar panels capable of generating power for more than 3,500 homes,.
A date for the start of the project has yet to be set.
The project will include a substation, 20 inverter stations and a CCTV camera system.
All cabling at the site - spread over three fields at the Innes Estate - will be underground, allowing sheep to graze around the panels.
Image copyright Elgin Energy Image caption Elgin Energy has already developed 24 solar projects in the UK and Ireland
Permission for the solar farm is valid for 30 years, after which the developer will have one year to decommission the works and restore the site to a condition agreed with the council.
A habitat management plan must also be approved by the council before works can begin.
In a statement, Elgin Energy said: "Existing field boundaries will not be disturbed and mature hedgerows will provide generous screening for the site.
"Elgin Energy has contacted those neighbours in the immediate vicinity of the site and has offered to answer any queries which might arise.
"The land will remain in agricultural use in the form of sheep grazing while being used for the dual purpose of generating low-carbon renewable energy."
'Win-win'
Councillor Claire Feaver, chairperson of Moray Council's Planning and Regulatory Services Committee, said: "A significant amount of renewable energy will be generated by this solar farm over the next 30 years.
"The opportunity to continue grazing on the land, together with the habitat management plan, will maintain and enhance the diverse range of species in and around the site.
"I see this as a win-win."
Scottish Renewables welcomed news that the Speyslaw project had been given the go-ahead.
'Attractive to developers'
Policy manager Stephanie Clark said: "Large-scale solar has played a part in Scotland since 2005 and we are now beginning to see more applications for commercial projects coming forward.
"North east Scotland's clear skies and longer daylight hours mean the area is attractive to developers.
"Large schemes like this one are able to use that resource to provide clean electricity which will help Scotland meet its climate change targets.
"Further progress in the solar sector, however, depends on the level of support provided by the UK government through the Feed-in Tariff and the Contracts for Difference schemes, both of which remain the subject of much uncertainty."
Elgin Energy, which has already developed 250MW of solar across 24 projects in the UK and Ireland, is planning an even bigger farm in Moray.
It is seeking planning permission for a 50MW project at the former RAF Milltown airfield, a few miles north east of Elgin.
A decision on that application is not expected until early next year.
I've been at Mozilla for seven years now doing various things. Just over two years ago I was tasked with my biggest project yet at Mozilla, transitioning the add-ons community over to WebExtensions. In about three weeks Firefox Quantum will go out to all the Firefox users and WebExtensions will be the only way to run an add-on on Firefox 57.
That's over two years of work from an awesome team of people at Mozilla who came together and decided to make this change. I remember clearly the feeling in those first weeks of sheer dread at what I'd gotten myself into. There's many who have helped and supported me on this project, but I think without Kev Needham guiding us, we would have been sunk. A good example was those first weeks when I went from a severe state of panic and dread, down to only a mild state of panic as a result of multiple conversations with Kev.
In those first weeks we had Kumar McMillan, Stuart Colville, Matthew MacPherson and Kris Maglione on the engineering team and the job of going out and finding more engineers was my main goal in those months. We were soon joined by Christopher Grebs, Mathieu Pillard, Mark Striemer and Luca Greco. By the time we got to our first work week, Berlin in 2016 we had Matthew Wein, Andrew Swan and Bob Silverberg as well. Later we were lucky enough to be joined by Shane Caraveo and Andrew Williamson.
The quality of these engineers can't be overstated, with a diverse set of knowledge and skills it's been amazing what they've been able to accomplish. I tried to make a list of all the things that they've done in this post, but this post would be extremely long. Just go read all the many, many blog posts we've done or even write a WebExtension.
For me its been hard not to take this project personally, there are many people who disagree with the decision to do this. They let us know about this regularly in many different ways. I've never encountered this at Mozilla to this level. That's given me a real appreciation for what others at Mozilla have had to deal with.
The navigating around those concerns has been rocky and sometimes I didn't handle it very well and that didn't help. There's been a learning curve there for me.
On the other hand, the support from other people who do agree with this decision has been wonderful. Just last week in Toronto multiple people came up to us and gave us thanks for the changes we've made. To all of you who have helped, a big, big thank you.
I remain steadfastly convinced that this is one of the best things we could do for Firefox and I'm proud the work that's been done. It's been a big change and with it comes risk and uncertainty. To say that I'm a little nervous about how this will go, will be an understatement.
But here we are, in about three weeks Quantum will be rolling out and there won't be legacy add-ons.
The forecast puts Game of Thrones as far in the future as 2019, but for Sophie Turner and the other actors involved in the HBO series, winter is already here.
Thrones, which earned a Golden Globe nomination for best TV series, drama, this week for its seventh season, is currently in the midst of production on its final season, which is expected to last through August of 2018. It's a long wait for fans of the juggernaut HBO fantasy franchise, but the participants themselves are well and fully entrenched in the final war for the heart of Westeros.
Will the White Walkers win the day following their breach of the Wall, or does humanity still stand a chance? Speaking with The Hollywood Reporter, Turner, who plays Winterfell's current commander Sansa Stark, certainly won't spill the beans on what lies ahead as the award-winning series begins the process of wrapping up its eight-season arc — except to say the mood among the cast and crew at least lives up to author George R.R. Martin's long-ago promise of a "bittersweet" ending.
Read on for Turner's tease of the final six episodes of Game of Thrones, their thoughts on Sansa's current place in the story arc considering the ending of season seven, and more.
You're in the midst of the final season of Game of Thrones, and as such, you know so much more about where the story is headed than the audience — which is always the case, but this time, the secret you're holding on to is the ending of the series. Is that a powerful feeling?
Yeah, I feel very, very powerful. (Laughs.) It's exciting. Shooting these scenes, knowing how it ends now, finally, after years and years of being kept in anticipation. We're shooting all of our final scenes. It's getting incredibly emotional. It's very real now.
Did you ever let yourself imagine what it would feel like once you finally reached the end of the line of Game of Thrones?
We've imagined it for so long. There's also an ambiguity every season when we would get the scripts: "Is this the season where we die?" To have made it this far is pretty unbelievable, considering the amount of deaths there have been. All of us have always had discussions about theories about what we think is going to happen — who's going to die, who's going to end up ruling. Now, we know. It almost feels like another one of our theories. It doesn't even feel like it's what's actually happening. It's very satisfying.
What was the mood like as everyone started coming back to set to start working on the final season?
It was very, very bittersweet. The first day of the actors coming in and that kind of production starting, the day where we had the final read-through for the final script, it was really bittersweet. It was hard. At the end of the very last script, they read aloud, "End of Game of Thrones." As soon as they read that out, pretty much everyone burst into tears. There was a standing ovation for [showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss]. We were all clapping and cheering. It was amazing. It was the first time every single castmember had been there and sat through all of the scripts for season eight — obviously not castmembers who had died in the earlier seasons, but …
Which would be incredible.
It would be incredible, but I'm sure they have better things to do now!
I don't know about that! If they had the invitation ...
I would hope so. (Laughs.) Maybe for the wrap party, we'll invite everybody who has ever died on the show. That would be great.
Looking back on the year of Thrones that just passed, there's a feeling that season seven was the first half of a two-part season. Did it feel that way for you, filming the season?
Definitely. It definitely felt that way. And it was probably even sadder because we didn't know what was going to happen in the end. We were filming the final push, but we didn't know who was going to die and who was going to live. The bittersweetness started there. Also, the anxiety of, "What the fuck are we going to do when this whole thing finishes?" (Laughs.) The panic started there. Probably since season five I started personally feeling like it was all winding down. All of the sudden, we started hanging out a lot more often and realizing we shouldn't really take this for granted. We're having more dinner parties and making the most of it more now.
Is that the hardest part about bringing the show in for a landing — not saying goodbye to Sansa and the world you have created, but saying goodbye to the people who created the world, from the actors to the camera operators and makeup artists and beyond?
Yeah, that's the hardest, especially the people who are behind the scenes that we don't necessarily see at the premieres and all of the press events. That's going to be the hardest. The final scene we shoot on set could be the final time we ever work together. It's really difficult and we're all getting emotional now, thinking about it. The girl who's done my hair since season one is like an older sister to me. The camera operator is like a father figure to me. It's going to be very hard. We really are like one big family. We've maintained that family throughout every season. We haven't switched up too many people, really. We haven't changed much in departments and department heads. It's been very consistent. It's like we're living in a bubble and there's nobody from the outside who has really come in. So, it's going to be very strange. It's been my entire life, really.
The first scene in Game of Thrones takes place beyond the Wall, giving a glimpse into the world of the White Walkers. But the series then proceeds to focus more on the human struggles and the power plays for the Iron Throne. In this past season, and moving into the endgame of the show, Game of Thrones has brought the fantastical side of the series more into the spotlight. Have you felt a sense of Game of Thrones becoming increasingly more epic as you reach the end of the story?
It's definitely more epic this season, for sure. It grows and grows and grows. There are bigger and more fantastical elements, which have always been underlying throughout, but this time, it's really emerging and there are very big roles this season. But we still very much managed to maintain those human relationships and stories that bring it back to reality and keep it resonating with the audience. The thing with Game of Thrones and the reason why I believe it works so well is we have these fantastic elements, which are balanced so perfectly with the real human elements — the character-driven plot points and things like that, where you get that escapism, but it's also very personal. It's really key to keep that going. The greater the fantastical elements become, and the more epic it becomes with the fighting and everything, the greater the character-driven storylines become as well, and the more epic they become. There are more relationships formed this season than any other, and more people meeting and more conspiracies and plotting and forming of alliances. We have had to parallel the two, just to ensure we keep that balance just right. It's a special, magic recipe.
You mentioned the "escapism" of Game of Thrones, which is truly one of the biggest shows on Earth. But it's also successful because of its realistic depictions of character struggles and quests for power — and in that way, it has a very modern feeling, especially in our current political climate. Do you feel those themes and that side of Game of Thrones is more relevant now than ever?
I do feel like that. I really do. In Game of Thrones, you see the behind-the-scenes of all these power-hungry people. You see their inner workings and why they're vying for power, to be the powerful person who gets to do whatever the fuck they say and can be sadistic and can thrive in that power. In this day and age, even in comparison to eight years ago, you can kind of see the people who were maybe more manipulative behind the scenes being outed now. It's out in the open, and it feels like we're almost getting an inside look at the people who are really in politics and in power — much like the way Game of Thrones gives you that. So, yeah, I do feel like it's pretty relevant to today. There's a theme of the manipulators and the power-hungry people all being outed now, and the crazy and disgusting things they do to get power and what they do with that power. Game of Thrones, because it's a TV show and we can allow people access to the people behind the throne, definitely parallels the modern day for sure. I can see a few Trumps on Thrones, for sure.
At the end of season seven, Sansa made the decision to kill Littlefinger. How did their arc last year inform what's next for Sansa? In other words, what did the events of season seven reveal about this character and their ambitions moving forward, ultimately?
It's funny. For the first time, at the end of season seven, we're seeing Sansa at a place of comfort and satisfaction. They now have eliminated all of the bad from their life and away from Winterfell. She's there with their family. They might not be the same people they were in the beginning, but they're still them family. They're still people they can trust. She's now only surrounded by people they trust. For the first time, we're seeing them very satisfied and happy — but you wonder, what's next for Sansa? What's going to motivate her? Is it just about keeping Winterfell as it is in this currently good place? Is it the rising threat of the undead? It's a very strange place for them Where do their motivations lie now? Now that she's run out of people to manipulate, I wonder if they feel a little bit lost!
Beloved shows have come and gone, and more often than not, there's at least a vocal minority of fans who are unhappy with the ending. Is there something freeing in knowing some people will be inevitably disappointed with how Game of Thrones ends, even if you find the ending satisfying?
Absolutely. It almost puts all of our minds to rest, just knowing the ending and being happy with that, no matter if anyone likes it or not. There have been so many theories and so many discussions with what people think is going to happen — where they would like things to go, and who they would like to see in power, and who they want to see die. Finally, just knowing. And for the people, when they watch it, I hope there's going to be some satisfaction in that it's come to an end and that's how it goes. There will be some people who are disappointed, I'm sure, because they will want certain people to end up in certain places. But at this point, I'm just happy with whatever David and Dan choose to do with the story. I've trusted them for the past nine or 10 years of my life with this. However they decide to end it is fine by me.
How did you feel personally when you finished that final table read?
I'm getting goosebumps now thinking about it. It was a shock to the system. We actually realized, reading that "end of Game of Thrones" line, that that was it. When you're in it, you don't really see an end point. It's just an ongoing thing you're living with. It was a real shock. It was really sad, but there was an immense amount of pride, too. We realized we had done it. We had created this amazing thing, and that's it now. It was just a feeling of pride. I was proud of David and Dan, and I was looking around at all of the other castmembers around the table, nodding at them, and saying: "Well done. We've done it." It was the craziest feeling. It's the biggest project we'll ever do. We've put our hearts and souls into it. Saying goodbye to it means putting parts of our hearts and souls behind. But we also know we've given it everything that we've got.

Future and the Weeknd went in very different, very well-documented directions in 2015. Eschewing pop fame, the Atlanta rapper immersed themselves in codeine and the dense trap beats of their pre-Pluto days. The Toronto singer, on the other hand, largely shed the sparse sound of their famed Trilogy in favor of MJ-worshipping, Max Martin-heralded pop success.
But the Weeknd did maintain their trademark destructive behavior. In this regard, they and Future are kindred souls. They're self-aware yet unapologetic, and operate best in the shadows. On "Low Life," Future drags the Weeknd back into the depths from which they had hardly receded. "I just took some molly, what else?" Future confesses from the onset, as if there's no alternative. The Weeknd simultaneously pulls some melody out of Future Hendrix, who never really starts or stops singing. Together, they find a middle ground of deadpan lyrics and palatable sonics. The Metro Boomin and Ben Billions-produced beat creates a similar contrast with echoey vocals or piano chords layered on top of drill snares. Nothing is surprising to Future and the Weeknd. No behavior is deplorable. They both sound natural and expressive on "Low Life," free to act and emote however they'd like.
This article is sponsored by Color Warz : Dark Threat, who has raised £15,477 on Kickstarter and are still going! Check out their Kickstarter Campaign and Press Release.
In my experience, the majority of creators who launch a project on Kickstarter or Indiegogo are hustling entrepreneurs or creative artists that have few excess funds to hire a marketing consultant or run a PR campaign.
At the same time, there are seasoned game production companies and establish businesses that pour money into their crowdfunding campaign, hiring a professional PR agency and often times “crowdfunding experts.”
Below, I've written a short overview of this new job title: Crowdfunding Consultant or Crowdfunding Expert. If you're having trouble finding a crowdfunding consultant, check out the Crowdfunding Directory.
Be sure to review part 1 of this series Doing due diligence on crowdfunding service providers.
3 Ways Consultants Charge
1. Strict hourly rate or fixed project cost
– These types of crowdfunding consultants charge an hourly rate for their services (and sometimes a consultation fee to have an initial discussion). They may also be willing to invoice a fixed amount for the project, provided a certain amount is paid up front.
Pros: For the fixed project rate, you know your costs up front. You're also likely to get a good understanding of the time and attention they are dedicating to your project. Finally, if you have a run-away success, they will not receive any cut of the earnings.
Cons: The costs add up quickly. Usually the time of service providers is only valuable in a cumulative effect over a long duration. Also, there is little incentive for the consultant to give everything they have to make your project successful, as their pay is a flat rate.
2. Commission based compensation
Crowdfunding consultants who embrace the uncertainty of raising money on Kickstarter or Indiegogo may be open to commission based compensation, where they receive a percentage of funds raised if the project is successful. Based on my experience, these types of consultants are rare, or are new to the business. You will find several that are willing to be paid on a percentage of funds raised basis, but often these consultants will only take on the project if a certain amount has been raised already.
Pros: No up-front costs for you. It will be in the consultant's best interest to see the project funded because their income is based on the campaign's success.
Cons: There is a free-rider effect, in that sometimes the actions of the crowdfunding consultant don't directly cause or contribute to the success of the project, in which case they would receive compensation anyway. Also, be sure to ask how many projects the consultant is involved in or how many they will be involved in throughout the duration of the campaign. Being involved with more campaigns means the consultant will not be able to devote as much attention to yours and increases the chance of the free-rider effect.
3. Hybrid model
A hybrid compensation structure includes partially hourly or fixed rate cost in addition to a percentage of funds raised. Usually, the hourly rate or fixed rate is lower than you would expect in the marketplace. Also, the percentage of funds raised is a lower number than if you were to approach a commission based compensation only crowdfunding consultant.
Pros: Personally, I like this model most. The consultant is paid, which always is a good way to focus someone's attention on an endeavor, and there are incentives to work hard. Just be sure to budget in the cut they take when you are considering how much money you need to raise.
Cons: The typical risks that come with hiring any kind of contractor or consultant. See Doing due diligence on crowdfunding service provids for some tips on this aspect.
Consultants Can Add Value (or not)
When hiring a crowdfunding consultant, it's important to be crystal clear as to how they will add value to your campaign. Will they be helping you market your campaign to your target audience? Will they be working to generate news articles about your project? Are they helping with planning the campaign strategy?
Some consultants specialize in the pledge generating marketing and PR activities that many creators have trouble with. Others take a more analytical approach, working with creators on their copywriting for the campaign, the reward tiers, the video, and the social media strategy for the duration of the campaign.
In order to make sure you are getting the most bang for your buck, it's best to hire a consultant that fills the desperate needs of your project If you have a strong network in the gaming industry, it might not make sense to hire a “crowdfunding expert” if they don't have any contacts in that industry to promote your campaign, or if they don't understand how it works. It would make more sense to go with a PR or marketing firm that specializes in this industry.
You can do some research on these consultants via LinekdIn, going through Google searches, or by looking through the crowdfunding directory.
3 Common Mistakes or Things to Watch
1. Being impressed by the “successful campaigns” they've worked on. Be sure to dig deeper into this information. If they've worked on 50 campaigns and 5 have been successful and raised a good amount of money (what they include on their webpage), that's a horrible success rate if they are charging by the hour. Don't just ask them about the successful campaigns they have worked on. Ask them about the failures as well.
2. Seeing the process as hiring a consultant rather than making an investment. You should only hire a consultant if you are confident you will receive a positive ROI from their activities. Also, don't overestimate the value they can add to your campaign. For example, on CrowdfundingPR, at the time of writing we charge $39.00 for the top promotion tier. Expecting this purchase to bring you an extra $1000 in pledges is an overestimation.
3. Looking for consultants before taking any other kind of action. Read as much as you can on your own before contacting consultants. It's also best if you've put a bunch of work into you campaign already. It's easier to for a consultant (and less costly) to critique your project, than create it. Finally, it may be tempting to outsource the mundane aspects of the campaign, but what makes Kickstarter and Indiegogo special is that creators have a direct connection with their fans. No one likes to find out that their hero doesn't actually write their own tweets or responses.
Could you resist the temptation to taste delicious mushrooms grown in the pristine woods of the Alps? These two Russians couldn't.
A couple of Russian tourists impressed the staff of five-star hotel in Switzerland by pickling mushrooms in a bathtub of their room, Russian online media Lenta.ru reported.

The two Russian tourists, both around 50 years old, checked into a hotel in the Alps and went for a walk in the woods on a mushroom hunt. Since there were no other mushroom pickers around, the couple collected everything that was within reach.
The tourists went to the woods several times that day. They collected so many mushrooms collected that it was impossible to eat them at once. The travelers then decided to pickle them in their hotel bathtub to keep them for a later date.
Since returning home, the couple has reportedly decided that they are planning a return visit to the same Swiss hotel.

Over-the-Rhine's rich brewing history marks another milestone Friday as construction begins on Taft's Ale House – transforming an abandoned, historic church building and recalling a famous family's past.
The new three-level brewpub will be housed in the old St. Paul's German Evangelical Protestant Church at 1429 Race St. and include a brewery, three bars and full-service restaurant seating 300.
An official groundbreaking is at 11 a.m. today. It's expected to open this fall.
Behind the venture are head brewer and partner Kevin Moreland and managing partners and investors Dave Kassling and Dave Williams.
"I've always had a business plan of doing a brewpub," said Moreland. They were head brewer at Listermann/Triple Digit Brewing Company in Evanston, where they launched the Triple Digit Brewing brand, for about two years. They also recreated a new Wiedemann's Special Lager for the new Geo. Wiedemann Brewing Co. after it was off the market for about five years.
Moreland's dream got off the ground when they met Williams, a University of Cincinnati grad and a partner in Pittsburgh-based Snow Capital Management company.
Moreland didn't want to run a restaurant, so Williams reached out to friend Dave Kassling.
"It's the coolest redevelopment that I've ever seen of any downtown area," said Kassling, the restaurateur behind Tri Tip Grill in New York City.
For the concept, the partners created a character, "Big Billy Taft," based on former President and Supreme Court Chief Justice William Howard Taft. On the logo, he's depicted in a bathtub – holding a beer, of course.
"We're taking the elements of everything we respect about them and adding an element of fun to it," Kassling said.
Thursday, the partners gave The Enquirer an exclusive first look at design renderings for the 15,000-square-foot-space, which boasts soaring 46-foot ceilings and dates from 1850.

Oakley-based architecture firm Drawing Dept. is working with New York interior design team Reid & Taylor Studio to integrate the "larger than life" Taft character, the history of the building and the modern equipment needed for brewing.
"This is really a Victorian neighborhood, and Taft is from that era," said Crystal Taylor, a managing partner at Reid & Taylor. "We're trying to bring the Victorian feel (in)."
Visitors will come up interior church steps, one of many spaces showcasing Rookwood tile. They'll then enter a large beer hall with eight wooden communal tables and a bar at the back. Behind it will be five bright beer tanks, with three more above it, and a painting of St. Paul from the building's church days.
A more intimate space for 24 will be off to the side, "on the verge of being in the brew house," Moreland said.
Flanking stairways on either side of the bar will lead to the upper floor on three sides of the main space, preserving the ceiling height. Upstairs, industrial table bases and stools will mesh with more delicate Victorian wallpapers and lighting. These will be more traditional restaurant tables, "out of the controlled chaos downstairs," Kassling said.
That level will have another bar, and the church's bell tower will house a private dining room. High, arch windows will be restored.
A lower level will be "Big Billy's Basement," or as Kassling puts it, "a cocktail lounge for beer." Seating for about 100 will include the lounge, bar and space inside a glass and steel train car that harkens back to the days of Taft and rail travel.
The project is expected to come in at about $8 million, including previous stabilization efforts by 3CDC.
"I've never been in a brewpub like this before, and I've been all over the world," Moreland said.

As for the beer, Moreland plans to use the facility's 4,000- to 6,000-barrel capacity to brew a wide variety of styles.
Ten types of Taft's beers will be on tap at all times; three house beers will be determined by customers.
Moreland also plans to interact with neighborhood businesses. For example, they might invite Over-the-Rhine bakers to bring ingredients they use and brew a beer with him.
Beers from other Cincinnati and Ohio breweries will also be served.
On the restaurant side, Kassling is planning food similar to their Tri Tip Grill, with an emphasis on tri-tip steak. That cut, the bottom part of the sirloin, is a triangular cut where three different muscle groups come together, so it's "very tender," they said.
At Tri Tip Grill, they use meat aged 21 days and put a special rub on it, char it in a yellow flame to get a crust on it, put it in a cedar wood smoker for two hours, then finish in an oven to medium rare. It's sliced thin for sandwiches, so the charred bits get in; thicker cuts are served as platters at dinner.
Also on the menu: chicken, salmon and simple sides, Kassling said. Prices probably will start at about $10 for a sandwich.
"These guys are really focused on being part of the neighborhood," said Anastasia Mileham, vice president of communications for 3CDC. "They realize that Over-the-Rhine is more than just an entertainment district; it's a community with residents and businesses."
Though they're excited about the neighborhood, the partners' long-term goals for Taft Ale House go beyond its boundaries.
"Once we see that we're capable of going to the market, you'll see Taft's Ale House brand on draft in the market," Moreland said. "We always talk about building this brand. This is the start; this is the kitchen."
"We hope to be a regional brand and, someday, a national brand," Kassling said.
"This is a dream for me," Moreland added. "I never thought I'd be standing in a room building my dream."

An Israeli soldier has killed a Jewish Israeli civilian in Jerusalem after each confronted the other thinking they were an Arab attacker, reports say.
The man was shot after trying to grab the soldier's gun during a scuffle, local media say.
It comes at a time of heightened alert amid a spate of attacks on Israelis and wider Israeli-Palestinian violence.
On Thursday, two Palestinians were shot after stabbing and wounding an Israeli in central Israel, police say.
Police say the assailants first tried to board a bus carrying schoolchildren before stabbing a 25-year-old man at a bus stop in Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem.
One of the attackers died and the other is in a critical condition, Israeli medical sources say.
Israel's domestic security agency said one of the attackers belonged to the militant group Hamas, while the other had previously been jailed for carrying a knife at a site holy to Muslims and Jews in Hebron in the West Bank.
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State John Kerry has called for Israelis and Palestinians to "end all incitement, to end all violence", at the start of talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Berlin.
The discussions come ahead of talks scheduled this weekend between Mr Kerry and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in Jordan.
'Mistaken identity'
According to media reports, a Jewish Israeli man confronted two soldiers boarding a bus in central Jerusalem early on Thursday, thinking they were potential attackers.
Police said the soldiers suspected the man themselves was a would-be attacker and asked to see their ID. The man refused and scuffle ensued, during which the man grabbed one of the soldiers' guns and was shot and killed by the second soldier.

It is the latest case of apparent mistaken identity amid the current security alert which has seen innocent civilians wounded or killed.
Earlier this week, a 19-year-old Eritrean migrant died after being mistaken for a gunman and then shot and beaten by passers-by at the time of an attack at a bus station in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba.
Last week, a Jewish Israeli stabbed and wounded another Jewish Israeli in an apparent revenge attack, in Haifa, northern Israel.
Eight Israelis have been killed and dozens wounded in attacks by Palestinians and an Israeli Arab since the start of this month. More than 40 Palestinians, including several of the attackers, have also been killed in the spiralling violence.
The upsurge began last month when tensions at a flashpoint holy site in Jerusalem revered by Jews and Muslims boiled over amid rumours Israel planned to relax long-standing rules in order to strengthen Jewish rights at the complex. Israel has repeatedly denied such claims.
What is happening between Israelis and Palestinians?
There has been a spate of stabbings of Israelis and some shootings - several of them fatal - by Palestinians since early October, and one apparent revenge stabbing by an Israeli. The attackers have struck in Jerusalem and across Israel, and in the occupied West Bank. Israel has tightened security and its security forces have clashed with rioting Palestinians, leading to deaths on the Palestinian side. The violence has also spread to the border with Gaza.
What's behind the latest unrest?
After a period of relative quiet, violence between the two communities has spiralled since clashes erupted at a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site in mid-September. It was fuelled by rumours among Palestinians that Israel was attempting to alter a long-standing religious arrangement governing the site. Israel repeatedly dismissed the rumours as incitement. Soon afterwards, two Israelis were shot dead by Palestinians in the West Bank and the stabbing attacks began. Both Israel and the Palestinian authorities have accused one another of doing nothing to protect each other's communities.
Is this a new Palestinian intifada, or uprising?
There have been two organised uprisings by Palestinians against Israeli occupation, in the 1980s and early 2000s. With peace talks moribund, some observers have questioned whether we are now seeing a third. The stabbing attacks seem to be opportunistic and although they have been praised by militant groups, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has said Palestinians are not interested in a further escalation.
What is driving the latest violence?
ELON MUSK has made a career out of confounding the experts. When they promised to slash the cost of spaceflight they were told it could not be done; nowadays SpaceX, their rocketry firm, charges around half what its competitors do and has a bulging order book. With Tesla Motors they have helped transform electric cars from limp-but-worthy vehicles driven by muesli-knitters into the objects of consumer desire that they must become if they are to displace fossil-fuel cars. So when on August 12th the South-African born tech squillionaire announced a super-high-speed transport system called Hyperloop that would put California's planned high-speed rail project in the shade, costing $6 billion instead of $60 billion and taking just half an hour to travel between Los Angeles and San Francisco, it generated plenty of buzz. Much of the commentary has been incredulous, arguing that the costs are impossibly low (a few have accused Mr Musk of acting in bad faith). But never mind the bean-counting, what about the technology? How exactly would the Hyperloop work, and is it at least theoretically plausible?
The Hyperloop is designed to overcome the biggest single obstacle to high-speed travel: air. At walking speed, air is ephemeral stuff. But, as any child who has stuck their hand out of a car window at speed knows, the faster you go the more obvious its effects become. In fact, the grunt needed to counteract air resistance rises with the cube of speed. That is why a Citroen C1 with a mere 50kW under the bonnet is good for 158kph (98mph), but a Bugatti Veyron requires a whopping 763kW to go a bit more than two and a half times as fast. It is also why the all-time human speed record is held by astronauts: in space, there is no air to slow you down. For over a century engineers and science fiction authors have dreamed of running trains through their own little chunk of outer space, by sending them through tubes from which all the air has been evacuated. That would allow them to reach enormous speeds: one study from America's RAND Corporation in the 1970s suggested a trans-continental underground “vac-train” with a top speed of 22,000kph that would ferry passengers across the United States in 20 minutes.

The trouble is that vacuums are finicky things, and maintaining them is tricky. Holding one in a long train-tunnel would be a serious technical challenge. Hence the Hyperloop's key difference from many other vac-train proposals: there is no vacuum. Instead, the tunnels would be kept at around a thousandth of the normal atmospheric pressure at sea level. That would be low enough to cut air resistance drastically, but high enough to keep the pneumatics simple—or at least simple compared with maintaining a hard vacuum. It does introduce another problem, though: Hyperloop capsules are designed to sit snugly within their tubes. At high speeds, they would act like a plunger in a syringe, compressing the air ahead of them. That would require large amounts of power to overcome, undoing many of the advantages of a vac-train in the first place. Mr Musk's proposed solution is to fit each pod with a fan designed to blow what little air is present through a pipe in the capsule and out of the back—essentially drilling a hole in the plunger. As a useful side-benefit, some of that airflow could be blown out of the skis on which the pods travel. That would keep them from bumping into the tunnel walls, removing the need for the expensive magnetic-levitation systems that do the same job in most vac-train proposals.
So far, so good? Well, perhaps. Designing something that is plausible on the back of a napkin (or in a 58-page PDF) is one thing; actually turning it into a buildable machine is much harder, even ignoring cost questions. Take passenger comfort: Hyperloop proposes to subject its passengers to fairly severe accelerations as it goes around corners and up hills; from the published numbers those accelerations seem greatly to exceed the rules of thumb used to design ordinary railways. Riding a rollercoaster from San Francisco to Los Angeles may not be a universally popular proposition. The system's capacity seems relatively low, too: each capsule would hold 28 people and one capsule would leave every 30 seconds. Assuming they were all completely full, that would be 3,360 people an hour—significantly less than a train can manage. And given the streamlined designs of the pods, there appears to be no room for an onboard toilet. Mr Musk has said repeatedly that this is merely the sketch of an idea, that they have no time to pursue it, and that others are welcome to build on it. Or, at least, that was the story: at the conference call following their announcement, they seemed to say that they might be amenable to building a small demonstration version after all. And there is no better way to prove or disprove an idea than to actually try it.
There's trouble brewing in the Tourism Promotions Board (TPB), a corporate body created by law in 2009 and attached to the Department of Tourism (DOT) under the supervision of the tourism secretary.
Last week, TPB employees sent a formal letter to the Presidential Action Center (PACE)— frontline desk in the Office of the President — outlining their concerns and complaints against Cesar Montano, TPB chief operating officer (COO), only three months after their appointment to the post by President Rodrigo Duterte.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Inquirer got hold of a copy of the letter, sent by a TPB officer.
Topping the list of 24 grounds for the TPB employees' complaints was the claim that on Jan. 18, Montano entered into an P11.2-million contract with Carat Philippines in which they performed as a guest singer together with their nieces.
The second ground for the complaints was that they brought in a team and consultants whose functions were already being rendered by incumbent employees.
Among three coterminous and confidential consultants was Rommel Montano, a brother of Montano, who, before their appointment, was mostly known as a TV/film actor.
The complaint also listed bit actors (stuntmen), a nephew of the wife of Rommel, a daughter of the COO's best friend, and a childhood friend of the COO among 17 consultants.
P16.5M for Luneta rally
Perhaps the most glaring complaint was No. 18, in which the employees said that the “TPB received a number of proposals for concerts and entertainment. These proposals are approved by Montano, without considering the recommendation of the proper department under its purview. These concerts/entertainment are in the millions of pesos. And these might just bleed the coffers of the TPB dry.”
The complaint specified that the TPB released P16.5 million in cash for a rally in support of Mr. Duterte on Feb. 25 at Manila's Rizal Park, with Carat Philippines as producer and Montano as one of the performers.
The TPB, the complaint noted, also provided sponsorship money to the “Jadine US & UAE Concert Tour 2017” in the amount of P12 million, in spite of the marketing communications department's negative recommendation.”
In one instance, the complaint added, “Montano went to Boracay with their staff without any itinerary,” and that “most of their domestic trips are not part of TPB's work program and they would charge it to TPB funds.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Last straw
In the complaint, TPB employees noted Montano's erratic behavior during meetings, and that “he rarely reports to Tourism Secretary Wanda Teo for direction so that TPB's programs can be aligned with that of the DOT's.”
The Inquirer tried to reach Montano to get their side, but they had not responded at press time.

In its reporting on a dubious lawsuit alleging Iranian meta-involvement in 9/11, the New York Times badly misunderstood the case and maintained for more than three years, in the paper of record, that the government of Iran “sponsored” the September 11, 2001, attacks. The belated correction, issued late Wednesday night on two widely spaced articles on the topic, unceremoniously noted that Iran did not, in fact, help commit the 9/11 attacks.
The correction came after a report about a lawsuit last week mistakenly claimed that Iran sponsored 9/11, something that had not been alleged in the suit. The article originally read:
The government has agreed to distribute proceeds from the building's sale, which could bring as much as $1 billion, to the families of victims of Iranian-sponsored terrorist attacks, including the September 11 attacks.
That 9/11 was an “Iranian-sponsored terrorist attack” is a spectacular claim and one that would radically alter the official narrative of 9/11, just casually thrown into an article by the Times. In fact, it isn't even something the lawsuit alleged. The case in question was a class action lawsuit for families of all terrorism victims, and since Iran was a “state sponsor of terrorism,” they were held generically responsible. (The US State Department maintains that Iran is a “state sponsor of terrorism” chiefly because of its support for militant groups like Hezbollah and Iraq's Kata'ib Hizballah, whose attacks have been mainly directed at other combatants.)
Even if this had been what the lawsuit was alleging, it's remarkable that reporter Vivian Wang simply took this as fact: No “alleged,” no “lawsuit claims”—Iran's guilt was simply asserted. And that assertion stood for a week until someone, evidently, got word it was grossly wrong. Late Wednesday night, the Times quietly added this correction to the piece:
Correction: July 6, 2017 An article on Friday about a jury's decision to let the federal government seize a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper it says is controlled by Iran overstated Iran's responsibility for the September 11 attacks. While a federal court found that Iran had some culpability for the September 11 attacks as a state sponsor of terrorism, it has not been established that Iran sponsored the attacks, which were planned and executed by Al Qaeda. (A similar error occurred in a September 25, 2013, article in the Times.)
Related: The NYT Erroneous Reporting On The ‘Coming Coal Boom'
It's as if the editors at the Times just got the memo about who was responsible for 9/11. But the week it took to correct this massive error was nothing compared to the close to four years it took to update the very same claim the paper made in September 2013. The original article, by Julie Satow, read:
Proceeds from a sale would probably be used to pay some of the $6 billion in damages claimed by family members of victims of Iranian-sponsored terrorism, including victims of the 9/11 attacks.
This article, published in the first year of Obama's second term, finally got corrected last week, with basically the same correction that ran on last week's story:
Correction: July 5, 2017 An article on Sept. 25, 2013, about the federal government's efforts to seize a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper it says is controlled by Iran overstated Iran's responsibility for the September 11 attacks. While a federal court found that Iran had some culpability for the September 11 attacks as a state sponsor of terrorism, it has not been established that Iran sponsored the attacks, which were planned and executed by Al Qaeda.
The corrections, belated as they were, minimized the defamation of the original articles in a lawyerly manner, conceding only that “it has not been established that Iran sponsored the attacks.” It has also not been established that Israel or Saudi Arabia or the Bush administration sponsored 9/11, but imagine the New York Times framing allegations against those actors this way. It's unthinkable but, because Iran is an Official Enemy of the United States, it is not subject to the same editorial standards as those in good standing with the US State Department.
Per the North Korea Law of Journalism—which states that “editorial standards are inversely proportional to a country's enemy status”—the Times can casually smear Iran as sponsoring the deadliest act of terror on US soil, and it's not taken seriously by anyone. Just thrown into an article, forgotten about and only corrected—with no special note by the paper—almost four years later.
One would be curious what the New York Times public editor would say about such a glaring error but the paper eliminated the position a month ago. Perhaps the Times' in-house media analyst, Jim Rutenberg, who spends much of their time hand-wringing over “fake news” and RT, could spare a column on how this happened. This is unlikely since with an Official Enemy, no amount of libel—no matter how egregious—merits a meaningful response from the paper of record.

Like their Israeli counterparts, Arab media outlets have been extensively covering the IDF's Operation Protective Edge. They have also conducted countless interviews with analysts, delivered breaking news and published various international condemnations. Unlike the Israeli media, however, the finger of blame is of course firmly pointed at Israel, while the Palestinian people are painted solely as victims.
Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter
But during this operation it has become evident that alongside the standard criticism of Israel, Hamas, which has in recent years lost face among the Arab public, has also been taking quite a bit of fire.
An example of this can be found in the Saudi newspaper “Al Watan”, which published an editorial on Friday that slammed not only Israel, but Hamas as well.
Beginning with its criticism of Israel, the article wrote: “Israel claims that it accurately hits targets, while the cameras show that among the victims there are innocent Palestinian families who have no knowledge of the conflict, which renders the Israeli response against what it calls ‘terrorism' as a greater type of terrorism.

The criticism of Hamas appears later on: “The world does not deal with Palestinians in Gaza and international organizations do not do them justice because Hamas has a bad relationship with the world, and no matter how right the issue is, there needs to be a leadership that can make contact with the world for support.”

The article further explained that among other things, “Hamas's isolation, its diplomatic impotence, its disconnection from the Authority and rebellion against anyone who is a legitimate representative of the Palestinian people makes it appear as a criminal in the eyes of the rest of the world.”
In Egypt, it was the television presenter and interviewer Amr Adeeb, known for their opposition to the Muslim Brotherhood, who took heat for their support for Hamas.
They called on Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to intervene for the sake of Gaza's residents, open the crossing points and provide assistance. However, considering the current atmosphere in Egypt against Hamas, which is affiliated with the commonly despised Muslim Brotherhood organization, the reactions were quick to come and Adeeb was called a Hamas member and a terrorist.

Broadcaster Amani al-Hayat from ON TV, which is affiliated with the Egyptian regime, was one of those who slammed Adeeb. They claimed that Hamas was to blame for Israel's “massacre” in the Gaza Strip and said that Hamas deliberately created the crisis in Gaza so that the Rafah crossing would be opened.

‘Tiring talk of Holocaust'
Even so, there are those in Egypt who still maintain a militant policy against Israel. The Egyptian newspaper “Al-Jamahiriya”, affiliated with al-Sisi government. which, according to reports is trying to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, tried to maintain a strongly militant attitude against Israel.

In one of its editorials, the paper wrote that “the murder of children, women, elders and the helpless people in Gaza with the use of deadly weapons from the sea, air and land are crimes against humanity committed by those who tire the world with talk about the Nazi Holocaust.”
The harsh article also claimed that the murder of Mohammed Abu Khdeir in Jerusalem put even the Nazis to shame. and that the “racist” Israeli government was no different to those who killed and burned their body.
At the same time, there is a widespread assumption in the Arab press that Israel was taking advantage of the situation in the Arab world and the lack of interest in the Palestinian issue to carry out its actions in Gaza.
In an article entitled “Gaza between ISIS and Netanyahu”, “Al-Hayat” newspaper wrote Friday morning that “it was expected that the new Israel foray against the Gaza Strip would benefit from the waves of violence that have spread into the area.”
"Sitting in Gaza and burning UN documents", as featured in the Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper
There are also those who take advantage of the Gaza operation in order to turn the spotlight on issues happening in their own area, such as the Syrian regime's media and Hezbollah. They have been reporting regularly about the current situation, especially from the viewpoint of the Palestinians in general, and not Hamas.
“Palestine is alone: who will take the masks off the faces of the hypocrites?”, an opinion piece in the Syrian Al Watan newspaper wrote. The article attempted to attack the Arab world and the clerics that were affiliated with the Syrian rebels for not speaking out against the current happenings in Gaza.
The UK's competitive edge in financial services is substantial and would be difficult to dislodge. But Brexit could damage London's attractiveness as the centre of European banking, as an entry point to the EU and as a global financial hub. FDI is also at risk.
London's strength as a global financial centre is impressive. The British capital has a share of nearly 50% in certain segments of global financial markets. Table 1 shows that the UK hosts 48.9% of the world's interest rate over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives turnover and 40.9% of foreign exchange (FX) turnover. The UK is also one of the main players in the US equities trades, with 20% of the global market. By contrast, other European countries play only a comparatively small role in global markets: France hosts 7.3% of interest rate OTC derivatives, and 2.8% of FX turnovers. In terms of European markets, the UK and Germany each have a share of more than 20% in the issuance of securitisation. The share of investment fund assets in Europe is 24% for the UK, compared to 22% in France and 17% in Germany.
In general, the UK has been accumulating substantial surpluses in trade of financial services over the last 15 years. Looking at the geographical distribution of UK financial service export in 2013, we see that 30% was with the European Union, while 70% was with the rest of the world. .
Recent research has found that the synchronisation of business cycles between the UK and the euro area has increased since the end of the 1990s. Campos and Macchiarelli have recently argued that this probably increases the costs of a potential UK exit from the EU. In a recent paper, we found that the UK credit cycle – measured here as the filtered growth of real bank credit to the private sector – has also become significantly more aligned with the credit cycle of the euro area, particularly since the end of the 1990s (figure 2). This suggests that EU-UK financial linkages have become tighter, although it does not tell us who would suffer the most from the financial consequences of Brexit. We should therefore look more in depth at specific aspects of UK-EU financial integration.
International integration of the banking sector
Turning to cross-border banking, table 2 shows that the banking sector of the euro area consists of 83% domestic banks, 14% banks from other EU countries, and only 3% from third countries. The rate of cross-border integration in the entire EU banking sector is even higher. 16 % of total bank assets are owned by banks based in other EU countries, and 9 % by banks from the rest of the world. By contrast, the UK seems to be a special case. It is the only EU country with more claims from banks in the rest of the world (32 %) than from banks headquartered in the rest of the EU (17 %).
This can be explained through the role of major US and Swiss (investment) banks, which use their London offices as a springboard to conduct business across the EU. Indeed, when asked about the importance of EU membership for financial service businesses located in the UK, 49% of high-level professionals from “The City” cited access to EU customers and 46% cited the single regulatory framework for financial services as very important for their own business (see Ipsos Mori poll, 2013). The former is guaranteed through the role of UK authorities in ‘passporting' banking and other financial services. Currently any firm headquartered in the UK can apply for a passport from the UK regulators to do business in the whole of the European Economic Area. The latter is granted through the European Court of Justice, which is in charge of enforcing single market rules. 84% of respondents said that the best option for the overall competitiveness of the UK as a financial center would be to remain a member of the EU.
Foreign direct investment in the UK
Beyond financial services, many European firms invest in the UK in a variety of sectors. When looking at the inward stock of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), the EU is the biggest FDI investor in the UK, with nearly 500 bn GBP invested in 2014, as opposed to 253 bn GBP invested by the US (figure 3). The FDI investment of European firms is spread across different sectors (figure 4), in 2014 most notably retail and wholesale trade (83.2 bn), mining (67.5 bn), IT (48.7 bn) and financial services (47.5 bn).
In this context, 415 members of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) in a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 also valued the financial aspects of EU membership: 52% of respondents said that the ability to invest in other EU states without restrictions had a positive or very positive impact on their business; 42% said that the ability of their company to attract inward investment from companies based in the EU would be negatively affected by the UK leaving the EU and 32% said that their company's ability to attract investment from companies based in non-EU countries would be reduced. A sizable 75% of respondents expected that Brexit would have a negative impact on the level of FDI.
Brexit uncertainty
If Brexit happens, the advantages of EU membership that businesses appear to consider the most significant could be at risk. The UK's passporting capacity in financial service might have to be re-negotiated. The UK's adherence to a single rulebook would also be called into question, as exiting the EU would mean exiting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. However, much would depend on the exact form of EU-UK relationship that was built after Brexit. The UK could opt for a Norwegian-style agreement, and join the European Economic Area (EEA) with full access to the single market. It would then fall under the jurisdiction of the EFTA Court of Justice, which enforces European laws in countries which are part of the EEA, but outside the EU.This would mean adopting regulations and standards without much influence on their development, an awkward situation for the EEA's preeminent financial centre. Another alternative would be free trade agreements or bilateral agreements, which could guarantee access to the single market in selected sectors while preserving independence in others.
However, the outcome of any negotiations for single market access or shared regulation is uncertain. This uncertainty alone could prove destabilising. Even if a new deal were eventually reached, the confusion surrounding the negotiations would have negative consequences for European firms operating in the UK and might endanger FDI flows to the UK. The attractiveness of London as a global financial hub and springboard to Europe might also suffer.
Voting in Egypt's parliamentary elections began in North Sinai on Sunday without incident and amid tight security, Al-Ahram news website reported.
Security forces transported the judges overseeing the ballots to the polling stations, Al-Ahram reported, with polls opening on time and voters beginning to cast their ballots.
The governorate of North Sinai is one of 13 governorates where voting in the second round of the parliamentary elections is taking place on Sunday and Monday.
To make it easier for locals to vote, the government decided to reduce hours of a curfew imposed since October 2014 - and reduced in past months - from 7pm to 1am to 11pm to 1am.
The Egyptian army has been battling an Islamist militant insurgency in parts of the North Sinai governorate for several years.
In July, the Egyptian army launched the largest and most comprehensive operation aimed at rooting out militants in the governorate, operation “Martyr's Right.”
In September the army announced that the first stage of the operation, which lasted for 16 days, killed about 500 militants and destroyed many hideouts in the governorate.
The government has recently launched a number of economic developmental projects in the North Sinai cities of Rafah, Sheikh Zuwaid, and Arish.
The population of the governorate is estimated to be 434,781, according to the State Information Service.
Eligible voters in the governorate number 234,635.
The first stage of the parliamentary elections, in which voters in 14 of the 27 governorates cast their ballots, was completed in October.

WASHINGTON — The Federal Bureau of Investigation in Puerto Rico received multiple allegations from residents across the island who say local officials in the territory have withheld needed FEMA supplies.
“People call us and tell us some misappropriation of some goods and supplies by supposedly politicians, not necessarily mayors, but people that work for the mayors in certain towns,” FBI Special Agent Carlos Osorio told The Daily Caller Wednesday.
Osorio explained, “They're supposedly withholding these goods and these supplies and instead of handing them out to people who really need them, [there are claims] that [local officials] are assigning them to their buddies first–people that have voted for them or people that contributed to their campaigns or what not.”
They added, “So what we're doing is looking into these allegations. That I can tell you is happening. Again, I cannot say that we have any ongoing investigation. We're just corroborating these allegations.”
According to Osorio, there are claims that despite delivery of hurricane relief by FEMA, assisted by other federal officials like the FBI to town centers, for example, local officials will first distribute the relief to their political allies once federal officials leave the area.
“We'll distribute the [goods and supplies] because we have to follow certain protocols, and that's what [local officials] said they were doing, when they were waiting for federal officials to leave, and the allegations are they are handing [relief] out through back doors and stuff like that to their buddies,” Osorio stated.
Illinois Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez, when asked by The Daily Caller about the allegations being made about FEMA aid being withheld by local officials, responded, “I can only tell you that the governor [Ricardo Rosselló] is in charge. I've asked the federal officials. They keep saying under the Stafford Act the governor is in charge.”
Another member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, New York Democratic Rep. Adriano Espaillat told TheDC, “Well, anybody that engages in that kind of action whether civilian or representative should be looked at seriously because that's unforgivable.”
As of now, the FBI is aware of six municipalities among Puerto Rico's 78 municipalities where such activity is allegedly happening–including San Juan, Arecibo, Patillas, Aguadilla and Vieques. The U.S. federal prosecutor on the island, Rosa Emilia Rodriguez, announced on WAPA radio last Sunday they are looking into these claims and is ready to criminally prosecute any official who withholds relief.

According to El Vocero, when asked Wednesday about one Puerto Rican representative suspected of withholding relief, Rodriguez replied, “I do not know them and I do not know the facts. I do not think it would be proper to comment on that. We are not going to individualize it. But, anyone who is withholding supplies is in violation of federal and state law.”
Rodriguez continued, “That has not changed. The (criminal prosecution) remains the same situation. Yesterday there was a government official from a municipality who gave everything they had to deliver very fast and it prevented us from charging him, and I suspect that now there will be many more who do not want to keep the supplies. But, definitely, what we get will be processed.”

Stem cells can be protected from the effects of ageing by a drug currently used to treat patients with osteoporosis, a breakthrough study has found.
Scientists from the University of Sheffield discovered the drug zoledronate is able to extend the lifespan of mesenchymal stem cells by reducing DNA damage.
DNA damage is one of the most important mechanisms of ageing where stem cells lose their ability to maintain and repair the tissues in which they live and keep it working correctly.
The pioneering research shows the drug protects the stem cells from DNA damage enhancing their survival and maintaining their function. Professor Ilaria Bellantuono, from the University's Department of Metabolism, said: "The drug enhances the repair of the damage in DNA occurring with age in stem cells in the bone. It is also likely to work in other stem cells too.
"This drug has been shown to delay mortality in patients affected by osteoporosis but until now we didn't know why. These findings provide an explanation as to why it may help people to live longer.
"Now we want to understand whether the drug can be used to delay or revert the ageing in stem cells in older people and improve the maintenance of tissues such as the heart, the muscle and immune cells, keeping them healthier for longer.
"We want to understand whether it improves the ability of stem cells to repair those tissues after injury, such as when older patients with cancer undergo radiotherapy."
Approximately 50 per cent of over 75 year-olds have three or more diseases at the same time such as cardiovascular disease, infections, muscle weakness and osteoporosis. In the future it is hoped this drug could be used to treat, prevent or delay the onset of such diseases rather than using a mixture of drugs.
Dr Bellantuono added: "We are hopeful that this research will pave the way for a better cure for cancer patients and keeping older people healthier for longer by reducing the risk of developing multiple age-related diseases."
The study, published today in the journal Stem Cells was funded by the Medical Research Council and Arthritis Research UK.

Advocates dream of flying killer whales to an ocean sanctuary, but experts clash over whether science supports the move.

How do you retire a 5-ton whale? That's a question some advocates and scientists have been asking themselves in the wake of SeaWorld's historic decision in March to stop breeding the 29 orcas in its care. Although the chain of theme parks says it will hold onto the animals until they die—which for many could be decades from now—a few groups want to fly them to a sanctuary in the sea, a kind of wildlife refuge for these intelligent and far-ranging creatures. The problem? No such sanctuary exists.
But the groups are laying plans. Last week, about three dozen scientists, veterinarians, and engineers announced the formation of the Whale Sanctuary Project (WSP), a Washington, D.C.–based nonprofit. The group is scouting sanctuary locations along North America's coasts—including coves and small groups of islands that could be cordoned off—with fundraising to follow. Other organizations have proposed similar ideas.
“There's enough known about how to do this that we could put up a facility in the next 3 to 5 years if we had the resources,” says WSP President Lori Marino, a biopsychologist based in Kanab, Utah. “We're moving pretty quickly.”
But critics say such plans are premature—and that they might not actually help the whales. Placing an orca that has spent its entire life in a sterile, concrete tank into an ocean filled with creatures and conditions it has never encountered before could be dangerous not just for the whale, but for the previously whale-free ecosystem, says Shawn Noren, a physiologist at the University of California (UC), Santa Cruz, who has studied orca biology at marine parks for nearly 20 years. And the costs are mammoth—perhaps tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. The challenges, they say, “are mind-boggling.”
BOTH SIDES OF THE ORCA captivity debate agree that killer whales are remarkable animals. They can travel thousands of kilometers and dive more than 600 meters. Their large, complex brains, like those of chimps, are twice as big as would be expected for their body size. And the orca neocortex, a brain region linked to self-awareness, communication, and problem-solving, is among the most highly developed in the animal kingdom. Orcas are also social creatures that live in tight-knit family units led by their mothers. They communicate in dialects of clicks and whistles that can vary by region. What's more, according to a study published last year, they're one of only three animals—besides humans and pilot whales—known to go through menopause, an adaptation that may free older females to care for their extended families.
All of this, advocates say, makes killer whales spectacularly unsuited for the relatively small, isolated tanks found in theme parks and aquariums. Marino and others have argued that such enclosures stunt the animals' physical and psychological growth, leading to stress, disease, and aggression toward other whales and even humans. Tilikum, a SeaWorld orca now in poor health, has been implicated in the deaths of three people, inspiring the 2013 documentary Blackfish, which played a major role in the company's decision to stop breeding its killer whales and displaying them in shows.

SeaWorld has countered that its orcas are healthy and well cared for, and that much of what we know about the species wouldn't have been possible without captive research. It has strongly resisted calls to release its whales to the wild, noting that they have spent most of their lives in pools, and would likely die in the open ocean. Many anticaptivity advocates actually agree. So, instead, they're pushing for a middle ground—something between a tank and the deep blue sea.
AN ORCA SANCTUARY has been attempted once before. In 1998, advocates loaded a killer whale named Keiko (star of the 1993 film Free Willy) onto a giant military cargo aircraft and flew them to a remote island cove off the southwest coast of Iceland. Individuals working with the Free Willy-Keiko Foundation hoped to eventually return the 20-year-old whale to the open ocean. But first they had to build them a sea home.
It did not go smoothly. Workers fashioned a sea pen out of foam-filled plastic pipe. Encircled by a deep net, it was about two-thirds the size of a football field, anchored to the ocean bottom with more than 100 tons of chain. About a year and a half later, the foundation opened up Keiko's sea cage and gave them access to the entire cove, which had been cordoned off with a 300-meter-long net. But fierce weather and heavy currents regularly struck the cove, fraying the net and ripping bolts from the sea floor.
Then there was the herculean task of caring for the whale. At its peak, the facility employed more than 20 people, including veterinarians, security officers, and trainers who taught Keiko to hunt for themselves and took them on “walks” in which they accompanied a boat in the open ocean, says Michael Parks, who was chief of marine operations for the project and is now with WSP. The cove was inaccessible by road, so everything had to be done by boat, including shipping in frozen herring by the ton to satisfy the orca's 300-fish-per-day appetite. Yearly costs were estimated at $3 million, and Keiko was there for nearly 4 years. But Parks says that while in the cove, Keiko got of the medications they had been on and grew more muscle.
In 2002, Keiko was given more access to the open ocean, and they soon joined up with a wild pod of orcas and left the cove for good. Satellite tracking showed that they made their way to Norway, but continued to seek human contact, and never fully integrated with their wild kin. They died of pneumonia in late 2003. No orca sanctuary has been attempted since.
MARINO'S GROUP HOPES to change that. And it's not being modest with its plans. Marino, whose academic research helped show that dolphins are capable of self-awareness, became an anticaptivity advocate about 10 years ago (Science, 29 April 2011, p. 526). They envision multiple sanctuaries that could hold up to several orcas, created by drawing a net between islands or cordoning off a cove like Keiko's, but in a calmer location. The enclosure would be “as open and naturalistic as possible,” they say. “It will never be ideal, but it will be enormously different than a theme park.” A sanctuary won't be able to replicate orca social life, Marino admits, but at least the whales could communicate acoustically with wild orcas, as Keiko did.

Roping off a stretch of water is just the beginning, however. Marino envisions a special area for veterinary care, a visitor education building (which could feature viewing platforms and underwater critter cams), a food preparation center, and housing for staff. “In some ways, we have to replicate what SeaWorld already has,” they say. “We have to be prepared to take care of them for the rest of their lives.” They estimate costs of up to $200 million per sanctuary and is counting on rich donors—and perhaps even SeaWorld itself—for help.
Howard Garrett thinks they can do it cheaper, at least for one whale. He's the cofounder and director of the Orca Network, a small nonprofit based in Freeland, Washington, that has been trying to remove an orca named Lolita from the Miami Seaquarium in Florida, where they have lived since 1970. The group has already selected a site—a calm bay in the San Juan Islands of Washington state.
Garrett envisions a simpler undertaking with no facilities for visitors. A local salmon hatchery would provide most of Lolita's food, and staff would be limited to feeders and the occasional veterinarian. They estimate about $1 million to create the enclosure and set the whale up there, and about $250,000 a year to care for them “It's not a high-tech operation,” they say. “It's a common sense operation.”
For their part, Marino says Garrett's group hasn't conducted proper environmental assessments and has vastly underestimated costs. But critics say both groups have oversimplified things.
“WE ALL LIKE THE IDEA of retirement,” says SeaWorld's chief zoological officer, Christopher Dold, a marine veterinarian in Orlando, Florida, who has worked with orcas for more than 20 years. But they say the park's whales already live comfortable, stimulating lives, and moving them to an ocean enclosure would be dangerous, for both them and the environment. “We're not willing to conduct that kind of experiment with the health and well-being of our killer whales.”
Dold notes that the ocean can be unpredictable, citing the storm damage to Keiko's enclosure as well as pollution, ship noise, and disease—all new for captive whales. And it's not just the impact of the environment on the orca; it's the impact of the orca on the environment. “You're talking about putting killer whales in places they don't usually live,” UC Santa Cruz's Noren says. What if they eat the local wildlife? “And what's the impact of all that whale poop?”
Plus, Noren says, we don't really know what these animals want. They worked with Keiko at an Oregon aquarium before they moved to Iceland, studying their diving behavior and metabolism. “He would stare at us through the window, even after our experiments were done. We were their social crew,” they say. “Who knows if they really wanted to go to Iceland? You can't get inside the brain of a killer whale.”
Then there's the cost. “It kind of makes me angry,” says Richard Connor, an animal behaviorist at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, who studies wild dolphins. They note that threatened whales and dolphins worldwide need more resources to help save them. “I'd rather see that money spent protecting marine areas and conducting basic science.” Still, Connor says that such sanctuaries might open up new research opportunities. “We've just scratched the surface of what we know about these animals.”
John Ford, a marine mammal scientist at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in Vancouver, agrees. Studying orca vocalizations and feeding patterns is more accurate in an ocean setting, says Ford, who has researched killer whales in their natural environment for more than 40 years. Scientists would also have better access to the orcas in ocean sanctuaries than in the open sea. They could strap recorders to the whales and even take breath samples—things that are much easier to do with trained animals in a confined space, they say. “You could do research you can't do in captivity or the wild.”
For now, however, efforts to retire the 29 orcas at SeaWorld and another 27 at aquariums and theme parks around the world remain a pipe dream. SeaWorld says it is focused on improving its captive habitats—making tanks more stimulating and naturalistic, for example with currents the orcas could turn on themselves, and perhaps even live fish.
In the meantime, anticaptivity advocates will continue to lobby SeaWorld and other facilities to retire more marine mammals, like seals and dolphins. “What we learn about retiring orcas will be used as a blueprint for others,” Marino says.
Nor will the conversation stop with marine animals. Whether it's orcas, chimpanzees, or elephants, “the more cognitively advanced the creature, the more we have to think about the environment we place them in,” says Stephen Ross, who oversees great ape research at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, Illinois, and also serves on the board of a chimp sanctuary. “These types of questions have always been there,” they say. “They're just rising closer to the surface.”
Correction (6 May 2016): This story has been corrected. The Whale Sanctuary Project has not been pressuring SeaWorld to release its orcas. The proposed whale sanctuary would include a special area for veterinary care, not a sea cage for feeding. And satellite tracking, not sightings, were used to follow Keiko after they left Iceland.
“Jane The Virgin” has cast “Magic Mike” star Adam Rodriguez for a recurring arc on its second season, TheWrap has learned.
On the Gina Rodriguez-led drama, Rodriguez will play Jonathan, Jane's writing professor.
“In the writer's room, we broke this arc with Adam in mind and we are all so thrilled to have him,” said showrunner Jennie Snyder Urman in a statement. “Wahooo!”
Adam Rodriguez will also recur on Fox's “Empire” in that drama's second season, as TheWrap reported earlier this summer.  They are represented by UTA and A Management. The actor best known for their role as Eric Delko on “CSI: Miami.”

It's time for those who want to keep natural grass at Michigan and Trumbull to put their money where their mouth is.
All they need to do is raise $100,000 a year and give it to the Police Athletic League, whose plan for a youth sports facility at the site of the old Tiger Stadium has been green-lighted by city council.
So far, opponents of PAL's plan to install synthetic turf at the Corner have been understandably reluctant to question PAL's intentions. How do you argue against city kids playing sports there? You can't.
Leaders of the Old Tiger Stadium Conservancy have been privately whining about how they never expected PAL to opt for carpet when they first made the deal. Members of the Navin Field Grounds Crew have raised good arguments about the health hazards of turf fields – and PAL CEO Tim Richey has now agreed not to use crumbed tire infill, which has been called a possible carcinogen in several recent national reports. Instead, they say PAL will install some other sort of synthetic turf.
Corktown residents and merchants want access to the field, which – thanks to the unauthorized mowing and grooming by the all-volunteer Navin Field Grounds Crew – has been theirs to play on for the last six summers. So Richey agreed at a Detroit City Council meeting to guarantee 15 hours of public access per week – but didn't say it would be free, or even during daylight hours.
Throughout recent public meetings, Richey has insisted that synthetic turf is necessary to support the intensive programming PAL plans for what it's touting as a showcase facility for youth sports. They made the same assertion Thursday morning on WJR's Frank Beckman show in an interview with substitute host ML Elrick. Until now, no one's been able to challenge them on that point.
Critics have questioned PAL for over-programming the site. But that's played right into PAL's hands. While the matter was before city council, PAL issued a plea to its supporters to come out in force against the nefarious folks who were trying to keep city kids off the historic field for “thousands of hours a year.” Ouch.
Since Richey has insisted the health and safety of its young athletes is PAL's top priority, their insistence on carpet has been puzzling. Even the “alternative” brands he's opting for now— which have surfaced in recent years after communities across the country have balked at their kids playing on crumbed tires—have not been proven safe.
Richey has maintained all along that PAL has done systematic research to support its conclusion that turf is safe. When I asked to see that research, what Richey provided was highly selective – mostly supplied by turf manufacturers and FIFA, the corrupt world soccer governing body that has been pushing turf fields.
The experience of people who've run intensive sports programs on natural grass, notably Deb Sumner of the Clark Park Coalition, proves Richey wrong – but to no avail, since apparently the deal to develop the Corner was already done in the back rooms of city hall.
When pressed, Richey has said something about rain and muddy fields and cited “a top turf expert” at MSU who backs up their assertion that they need a synthetic surface to withstand the amount of programming they plan, including football, soccer, lacrosse, and other events like “movie nights,” and, oh yes, baseball.
At the Corktown community meeting on Oct. 28, Richey distributed a list of “talking points” that included a quote from that expert, MSU turf management professor John Rogers, asserting “I do believe synthetic turf … is the best option” for the PAL project.
I'll be charitable and call that quote intellectually dishonest rather than an outright lie. It's what we journalists would call cherry picking.
You see, I talked to Richey's expert two weeks ago. And far from backing up Richey's assertion that he's on PAL's side in this, John Rogers made it crystal clear he's not.
Rogers told me they are so opposed to artificial turf they refuse even to research it. They went on to say: “The decision to use artificial turf is always made by people who will never spend one minute on the field. If they were out there and the surface was 140 degrees, they might not like it so much. If they were out there and banged their knee on the field, they might not like it so much.”
Some months ago, Richey asked Rogers to give their expert opinion on what surface would work with PAL's plan to program the field for six to ten hours a day. Richey also made it clear what PAL's budget for maintenance would be.
Rogers explained to me that proper maintenance of a natural grass field requires a real professional, and PAL didn't have that expertise nor was it allocating nearly the amount of resources needed to hire a pro groundskeeper. Rogers couldn't recall the exact maintenance figure in the PAL budget but scoffed that it was “less than six figures a year.” So Rogers had no choice but to write back to PAL that, given its budget and programming, they would have to use synthetic turf – because it doesn't take much money to hire someone who can sweep off a carpet.
I asked Rogers if PAL could do the programming it wants on a natural grass field at Michigan and Trumbull, and they said absolutely yes if it allocated a proper amount to maintenance. Then they laid out the kind of budget it would take, and it was about $100,000 more annually than PAL had told them it wanted to spend.
This might explain why Richey told me that PAL considers the costs of grass versus turf “a wash” – even though an artificial turf field costs about a million dollars to install and needs to be replaced after ten years. Maintaining grass would cost that same million dollars more over a decade, using Rogers' estimates. But it's clearly a choice PAL is making on how it's allocating the money.
Questioning PAL's programming or public access plans does little good now. PAL has been given the keys to the car. The conservancy has agreed to award PAL the $3 million left from a 2009 earmark Sen. Carl Levin obtained to redevelop and preserve the Corner “as a public park” – though it arguably isn't really that. Last week city council unanimously approved the land transfer that starts the project in motion.
PAL can program the field to its liking now – if it can raise the remaining half of the money needed for its $15.5 million project. Its fundraising campaign touts the unquestionable virtues of city kids playing on the historic grounds. So far, however, it's fallen millions short of its goal, and the recent negative publicity can't be helping. Last week, a major corporation reportedly pulled the plug on its longtime support for PAL.
PAL's position is so bizarre that some observers have started to question whether it's in bed with turf manufacturers.
PAL could use some help, it seems. How about an offer it can't plausibly refuse?
I'd bet PAL parents would like to know the real reason Tim Richey insists on a synthetic field. After all, it's their kids who will be playing there.
I'd also wager Eric Larson would value their planned housing development on Trumbull as worth at least $100,000 a year more if it bordered a historic field with real grass.
That's a small sum compared to the total project cost. So let's have a campaign to raise the additional $100,000 for annual maintenance and give it to PAL – so that the young people of our city can play there on natural grass.
If PAL refuses that offer, Richey will have to give the community a real explanation for opting for artificial turf – rather than the phony one he's been getting away with.
I'd be happy to chip in the first $100.
MONTREAL -- World light heavyweight contender Artur Beterbiev returns to the ring Saturday night, June 7, to defend their World Boxing Organization (WBO) International and North American Boxing Association (NABA) title belts against Argentinian champion Ezequiel "El Olympico" Maderna in the 12-round main event at historic Bell Center in Montreal, Canada. Photos by Robert Levesque/Photo Zone Sport.
Presented by Groupe Yvon Michel (GYM), the "Grand Prix" boxing event is part of the prestigious Premier Boxing Champions (PBC) series, which will air live in Canada on pay-per-views starting at 8:00 p.m. ET via Canal Indigo, Bell TV and Shaw TV. The main event and co-feature, commencing at 11:00 p.m. ET / 8:00 p.m. PT, will be broadcast on ESPN in the United States.
"We will launch the Grand Prix activities, which is the biggest sport week in Montreal, with this card", said the President of GYM, Yvon Michel. "Artur is the next boxing superstar in Quebec. They injured their shoulder, but the surgery fixed everything and we plan to give them three fights in 2016. We aim at Sergey Kovalev by the end of the year or the beginning of 2017."
The 31-year-old Beterbiev (9-0, 9 KOs), the adopted son of Montreal, is on a seek-and-destroy mission for their first fight in one year. The two-time Russian Olympian hasn't fought since last June, when they stopped Alexander Johnson in the 7th round, due to a shoulder injury that required surgery.
Beterbiev is world ranked among the top six in all four major sanctioning organizations: IBF #2, WBO & WBA #4, and WBC #6. The power-punching Betervbiev will be defending their WBO International and NABA titles against Maderna.
During their 3-year professional career, Beterbiev has defeated two former world champions, Gabriel Campillo and Tavoris Cloud.
Maderna (23-2, 15 KOs) is a veteran fighter from Argentina, the same country that has produced numerous championship boxers, from Luis Firpo to Sergio Martinez, as well standout contemporaries such as IBF cruiserweight champion Victor Ramirez, along with contenders Lucas Matthysse, Jesus Cuellar, Omar Narvaez and Juan Carlos Reveco. In their most recent action last May, Maderna stopped Rolando Wenceslao Mansilla in the opening round for the Argentina super middleweight championship.
Also airing on ESPN in the co-feature, undefeated American prospects Bryant "Goodfella" Perrella (13-0, 12 KOs), fighting out of Fort Myers, Florida, and David "Day Day" Grayton (14-0, 10 KOs), of Washington D.C., square off in a 10-round middleweight bout.
Unbeaten super welterweight Jamontay "Quiet Assassin" Clark (9-0-0, 6 KOs), from Cincinnati, Ohio, meets an opponent to be determined in a 6-round "TV swing" match.
Montreal's undefeated heavyweight Oscar "Kaboom" Rivas (18-0, 13 KOs), also a 2008 Colombian Olympian, returns in an 8-round bout versus TBA.
Also fighting on the undercard is popular French-Canadian welterweight Sebastian Bouchard (12-1, 4 KOs) who meets an opponent to be determined in an 8-rounder; Montreal super bantamweight Vislan Dalkaev (6-0, 2 KOs) vs. Mexican invader Javier "El Chivero" Franco (25-17-4), Montreal super middleweight Dario Bredicean (8-0, 2 KOs) against TBA and Toronto's Parnell Fischer (0-1, 0 KOs) vs. Mexican opponent Larami "Sir" Carmona (1-2, 0 KOs) in a 4-round fight.

Villa Park woman fights illegal gambling
hello
Kathy Gilroy of Villa Park faces a frustrating legislative world where the odds are against them Them complaints about charity events that they think are examples of illegal gambling often bounce from agency to agency.
As many suburbanites wade through their NCAA basketball bracket paperwork to see if anybody in their office pool has Norfolk State or Lehigh making the Sweet Sixteen tonight, Kathy Gilroy of Villa Park boasts their own mounds of paperwork.
The 62-year-old anti-gambling watchdog's collection of zippered bags holds handwritten notes, legal decisions, email correspondence with public officials, faxes, newspaper articles, court transcripts, the Illinois criminal code from 1961, the latest legislation on video poker machines, and myriad copies of local ordinances, and state and federal laws spanning more than 20 years.
"I kind of consider myself an expert," Gilroy says. They also don't see anything cute in that story about the 11-year-old story Omaha, Neb. boy busted for running an NCAA tourney pool at their elementary school.
A native of Lost Nation, Iowa, where a park is named in honor of their relatives, Gilroy began their crusade against illegal gambling before the first Midwest riverboat casino opened in 1991 in Davenport, Iowa.
"I just knew it was Pandora's box. I just knew it was going to be bad news," Gilroy says. They tell of a farmer who gambled away the family farm, another who ended up broke because they gambled away all the profits after selling a truckload of hogs, and a childhood friend who threw away a marriage and tens of thousands of dollars chasing a gambling addiction.
Gilroy, an insurance agent who calls their watchdog duties "my second job," devotes much of their energy to cracking down on charities that don't follow the gambling rules in an environment where the lines often seem blurred.
"Is it charitable gambling, or is it gambling that is using, or abusing, a charity?" they ask.
Some critics dismiss them as a busybody, a quixotic character flailing at windmills. She's seen their letters to politicians tacked up on bulletin boards identifying them as "our gambling pest." A public official once told them to "Get a (expletive) life!" Gilroy says.
But she's knocked down a few of those windmills she's attacked. A volunteer with stoppredatorygambling.org, their crowning achievement might be from their work to stop kids from gambling.
"In 2000, all four Naperville high schools were sponsoring casino nights, and I got them shut down," Gilroy says.
The watchdog also sank their teeth in high-profile raffles sponsored by Chicago Bears Hall-of-Famers Walter Payton and Richard Dent, resulting in a law being changed. They shut down a fundraiser hosted by the grieving parents of a murder victim, and put the brakes on a motorcycle club's raffle to raise money to send burn victims to a camp. She's working now with legislators trying to crack down on charity raffles that use the Internet, phone and U.S. mail.
Ignoring violations of gambling laws simply because the proceeds go to a good cause is the same as ignoring an armed robber who is using their ill-gotten gains to feed their hungry children, Gilroy argues.
At a meeting of the Illinois Gaming Board, which oversees casino gambling and video poker, Gilroy sits near the front and takes notes. When the board fines the new Rivers Casino in Des Plaines $25,000 after the casino revealed it violated rules by granting membership cards to seven problem gamblers on the state's self-exclusion program list and gave cash advances to two gamblers who should have been barred from entering, Gilroy rolls their eyes. "I wonder how much money they lost at that casino," they say of the problem gamblers.
State gambling regulators know Gilroy.
"I just wanted you to know you weren't trying my patience," says a smiling Mark Ostrowski, administrator of the gaming staff, who seeks out Gilroy after the meeting to discuss some of their recent email correspondence.
"I think it's good that they (Gilroy and other watchdogs) are out there keeping the regulators and the industries on their toes," says Gene O'Shea, director of the self-exclusion program and a spokesperson for the gaming board.
One of the frustrations facing Gilroy is that "there isn't one kind of gambling," says Sue Hofer, a spokesperson for the Illinois Department of Revenue, which has a division that regulates charitable gaming. The complicated tax rules for a charity that hosts a gambling event are different from those governing a "Sweet 16" birthday bash in a private home. The state lottery, the casinos and video poker, the race tracks, charity raffles and casino nights all fall under the jurisdiction of different regulating bodies with different rules, and deciding which agency has jurisdiction is tricky.
Gilroy says complaints often bounce from agency to agency and many times end up with local police. Generally not spending the effort to investigate their complaint, police often tell them to contact the local state's attorney or even the FBI, they add.
"Why should I have to do all the work?" they say. "Don't they have people who are supposed to investigate that stuff?"
Them complained about one suburban charity event was dismissed by a police department that has two officers helping to run the event, notes Gilroy, who did manage to get a poster advertising the event removed from the police department window.
They say many of the machines in kids' arcades are basically roulette wheels and slot machines. Them rage against those machines often falls on deaf ears. She's ticked that a company with mob ties was denied a license for video gambling devices in Illinois but still can put games of chance in kid arcades. It bothers them that older people can't qualify for assistance if they give away all their savings to their kids, but can qualify if they lose it all at a casino.
"My main problem with all of this is the home parties and the underage gambling," Gilroy says.
If senior citizens who grew up in an era when gambling was considered an evil racket run by the mob can become gambling addicts, today's children might be even more susceptible, Gilroy figures.
"I worry," Gilroy says. "They are growing up in a culture that accepts it."

Just about everywhere you went on Belle Isle this morning, there were crews of volunteers getting their hands dirty — raking what seemed like mountains of leaves, clearing tree branches, cleaning up debris.
"My mom used to tell me how good this place used to look," Lucas Sitto of Warren, a first-time visitor to the island, said as they gathered a pile of leaves near the Belle Isle Zoo and threw them in a big bag. "It could use some work."
Sitto and hundreds of other people were determined to provide that help, spending hours this morning participating in the Belle Isle Park Annual Spring Clean-Up. There were young people and adults, Detroiters and suburban residents, individuals and big groups.
The event was coordinated by the Belle Isle Conservancy and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. It was held to coincide with the celebration of Earth Day, which officially was Friday.
The Belle Isle cleanup has been held since the 1970s, said Genevieve Nowak, director of volunteer services for Belle Isle Park.
"It's been wonderful," Nowak said as the event began wrapping up and volunteers were getting set to chow down on lunch. "We had an absolutely incredible group of volunteers."
That included the folks who were part of the cleanup efforts, but also the volunteers who helped organize the event.
Nowak said an estimated 700 people participated. For the first time, they worked with Riverside Kayak Connections to have experienced canoers and kayakers help with the cleanup.
"They got out into the canals and cleared the debris," Nowak said.
Al Ellis of Grosse Pointe Farms was one of them. They have participated in similar events in other areas of Detroit.
"We work in the city, and we want to help out and do what we can to keep the park beautiful," Ellis said.
For Ashley Hoskins of Canton, it was an opportunity to participate in an activity with their coworkers at WSP/Parsons Brinckerhoff and also to help their hometown. They said she's excited by all the development happening in the city.
"I wanted to give back to the city of Detroit. I was born and raised here and I want to see the city prosper."
Grace Marchionda of Warren was among the first-timers to Belle Isle.
"It is really pretty," they said.
They came out, they said, because it's an Earth Day event.
"And we want to be helping clean up the environment," Marchionda said.

It seems like the the HBO prohibition drama Boardwalk Empire will be heading into the thirties for some hard times for its final season.
Actor Steve Buscemi Talks 'Bittersweet' End To HBO Series
Early this morning reports came in that Michael K. Williams, who plays Chalky White on the show, admitted to a rather significant time jump for Boardwalk Empire's fifth season. While talk of such a jump has existed for a few months now, Williams confirmed that the last season is set to pick up in 1931.
Boardwalk Empire Adds New Character
With last season's finale taking place in 1924, moving into the thirties would bring the program closer to the end of prohibition and right into the heart of the Great Depression. Considering the emphasis on the glitz and glam of the roaring twenties, a shift into the darkness of the Great Depression would be a significant tonal change.
Williams admitted to Den Of Geek that their character will be out to "settle old scores" and that the costumes are going to be a lot different than they had been for previous seasons.
The move into a time of poverty and political change could mean bad things are coming for the infamous Enoch "Nucky" Thompson (Steven Buscemei), who's real-life counterpart, Enoch "Nicky" Johnson, saw their own downfall during this time.
While Johnson lived through the thirties and died of natural causes, they did find themselves in jail by 1941, their age of wealth and power in Atlantic City, NJ having come to a drastic close.
The fifth and final season of Boardwalk Empire will premier on HBO Fall 2014.

Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted
In Ohio, Republican-approved cutbacks in early voting will disproportionately disfranchise African American voters who live in the state's most heavily populated counties. Ari Berman at The Nation gives us the skinny
In Cleveland's Cuyahoga County, African Americans make up 28 percent of the population but were 56 of early voters in 2008. In Columbus's Franklin County, they make up 20 percent of the population but were 34 percent of early voters.
That early voting was a product of the mess in 2004 when voting machines were distributed in such a way as to create long lines in predominately Democratic, minority precincts. Many voters simply gave up and went home. A report by the Democratic National Committee estimated that 174,000 voters left the queues. George W. Bush won in Ohio with 118,000 votes. Subsequently, Ohio added 35 early-voting days to the election calendar and 2008 went much smoother. Barack Obama won a majority of the votes in Ohio.
As a consequence, Republicans cut early voting back for the upcoming election from 35 days to 11 days, with the three days right before the election eliminated.
Now, in heavily Democratic cities like Cleveland, Columbus, Akron and Toledo, early voting hours will be limited to 8 am until 5 pm on weekdays beginning on October 1, with no voting at night or during the weekend, when it's most convenient for working people to vote. Republican election commissioners have blocked Democratic efforts to expand early voting hours in these counties, where the board of elections is split equally between Democratic and Republican members. Ohio Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted has broken the tie by intervening on behalf of their fellow Republicans. ‘I cannot create unequal access from one county board to another, and I must also keep in mind resources available to each county,” Husted said in explaining their decision to deny expanded early voting hours in heavily Democratic counties. Yet in solidly Republican counties like Warren and Butler, GOP election commissioners have approved expanded early voting hours on nights and weekends.
Say what? Unequal access for the boards? It's unequal access for voters at issue, sir. But you knew that.
To repeat: Republicans in wealthier suburban districts will be able to vote at night, on weekends and other off-hours during those 11 early balloting days. Working-class Ohioans, Democrats or leaning that way, will find that early-voting hours in their counties are more likely to be available when they're on the job and can't get away. Which, of course, goes counter to the purpose of early voting.
As Abe Zaidan has noted in regard to these shenanigans:
No county will be impacted more than Cuyahoga, where Democratic officials, organized labor and some clergy are outraged by the GOP's handiwork. "It's Republicans' dirty little secret," declared county Democratic Party Chairman Stuart Garson. "What they are saying is, 'We don't want you people voting'."
Husted and other Republicans can try to label this nothing more than a local affair adjudicated totally within the rules the state has set forth. Move along. Nothing to see here.
In fact, it's the new Jim Crow.

Join us and the Ohio Organizing Collaborative in urging the state to give everyone in Ohio easy access to early voting right up to election day.
There are now just a few weeks to the opening of our magnificent Magna Carta exhibition. We're very excited today to announce that on display will be some extremely precious items loaned to us by our friends at Worcester Cathedral and Worcester City Art Gallery and Museum.
King John's molars, found in their coffin in 1797 (image courtesy of Worcester City Art Gallery and Museum)
For starters, you'll be able to see King John themselves at the British Library this spring and summer or, at the very least, those parts of them that survive outside their tomb! John's tomb at Worcester Cathedral was opened for a brief period in 1797, and certain of their body parts removed as souvenirs. On display in Magna Carta: Law, Liberty, Legacy will be two of King John's molars, taken from the tomb by William Wood, a stationer's apprentice, and kindly being loaned to our exhibition by Worcester City Art Gallery and Museum. On show with them will be a thumb-bone, reputedly that of King John, which was returned to the cathedral in 1957. We're thrilled that we are going to have these items in our Magna Carta exhibition, and we're extremely grateful to the two institutions concerned for so kindly agreeing to lend them to us.

Worcester Cathedral will also be lending some other items to Magna Carta: Law, Liberty, Legacy. Also found in the tomb in 1797 were some pieces of textile, identified as parts of King John's hose and shroud, together with a portion of their leather shoe. Come and admire how a medieval king was dressed, and what they wore on their feet! In addition to this, we're very pleased to announce that we will also be displaying King John's own will in our exhibition, again on loan from Worcester Cathedral. This is the earliest surviving original English royal will, and it attests to John's deteriorating condition in their final days, since they left the distribution of their effects and the administration of their kingdom to a group of close advisers, being in an unfit state to make more detailed provisions. Once again, we are delighted that this key witness to King John's final days will be on display in London, where it can be seen alongside other books and objects relating to this troubled period in English history.

Magna Carta: Law, Liberty, Legacy promises to be the largest exhibition ever devoted to the Great Charter, and the centrepiece of international celebrations to commemorate the 800th anniversary of the granting of Magna Carta in 1215. This could not have been made possible without the generosity of our lenders, among whom we wish to particularly acknowledge Worcester Cathedral and Worcester City Art Gallery and Museum.

An activist for a sub-group of the anti-gay group the National Organization for Marriage is speaking out against the use of the rainbow as a symbol for gay rights. “We are the real rainbow coalition. The gay lobby does not own the rainbow,” they said.Dr. Jennifer Roback Morse is the founder and president of the Ruth Institute, which describes itself as “a project of the National Organization for Marriage.” On its site, the group describes its mission statement as “to promote life-long married love to college students by creating an intellectual and social climate favorable to marriage.”
Becky Yeh of right-wing American Family News Network's OneNewsNow, a product of the American Family Association, writes that Morse says “the rainbow is a sign of God's covenant with man.” Morse told ONN: “Proposition 8 was passed by a great grassroots coalition that included people from all across the religious traditions, and also people of every race and color. We are the real rainbow coalition. The gay lobby does not own the rainbow.”
Morse continued: “We can't simply let that go by. Families put rainbows in their children's nurseries. Little Christian preschools will have rainbows…Noah's Ark and all the animals…. Those are great Christian symbols, great Jewish symbols.” They also described how they wore a rainbow scarf to the Prop 8 hearings to show that anti-gay marriage activists still own the symbol.
Morse operates a blog on the Ruth Institute's website, and recently wrote a post asking supporters of same-sex marriage: “Do you really believe that mothers and fathers are interchangeable and that gender is irrelevant to parenting? If gender is really irrelevant, why do self-described “gays” insist on having a male sex partner? Why isn't a really masculine woman just as acceptable as a male sex partner?”

Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton said Sunday that Donald Trump's apparent call for Russia to hack their email shows they are "not temperamentally fit to be president and commander in chief."
Clinton told "Fox News Sunday" host Chris Wallace that Trump's remarks -- which the Republican nominee has said were sarcasm -- are a national security problem.
Russia's suspected role in the hack of the Democratic National Committee's emails "raises serious issues about Russian interference in our elections, in our democracy," Clinton said in their first interview with Fox of the 2016 campaign.
"We would not tolerate that from any other country, particularly one with whom we have adversarial positions," they said. "And for Trump to both encourage that and to praise (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, despite what appears to be a deliberate effort to try to affect the election, I think raises national security issues."
In the interview, Clinton used the email issue to cast Trump as overly cozy with Putin -- part of an effort to undercut Trump's qualifications on foreign policy and to suggest he's not steady enough for the presidency.
"I think if you take their encouragement that the Russians hack into American email accounts, if you take their quite excessive praise for Putin, their absolute allegiance to a lot of Russian wish list foreign policy positions, their effort then to try to distance themselves from that backlash -- which rightly came not just from Democrats, but Republicans, independents, national security and intelligence experts -- leads us, once again, to conclude they are not temperamentally fit to be president and commander in chief," they said.
Clinton also responded Sunday to Pat Smith, the mother of Sean Smith, who was killed in the attacks on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, and who said at the Republican National Convention that Clinton "lied to me" and that they blame Clinton personally for their son's death.
"My heart goes out to both of them. Losing a child under any circumstance, especially in this case -- two State Department employees, extraordinary men, both of them, two CIA contractors gave their lives protecting our country, our values -- I understand their grief and the incredible sense of loss that can motivate that," Clinton said. "As other members of families have lost loved ones, that's not what they heard. I don't hold any ill feeling for someone who in that moment may not fully recall everything that was or wasn't said."
Pressed on gun rights, Clinton said they believe the Second Amendment does guarantee individuals' rights to own firearms.
"Yes, but that right, like every other of our rights, our First Amendment rights, every right that we have is open to and even subject to reasonable regulation," they said.
And they discussed accepting the Democratic nomination Thursday night in Philadelphia -- saying they were emotional when they stepped onto stage after being introduced by their daughter, Chelsea Clinton.
"It was way over-the-top emotional," Clinton said. "My biggest concern going out there to make that speech Thursday night was whether or not I could control my emotions."
Them concern, they admitted, was "that I would start crying ... Watching my daughter and having them waiting on stage when I came out, I was pretty concerned about whether I'd make it through the speech."
The popular Argentine has become an adopted Mancunian over almost a decade in the north-west, where they have won two Premier League titles, two League Cups and the FA Cup since arriving from Barcelona-based Espanyol in summer 2008.
And the 32-year-old is now so settled in England that they admit to missing the gloomy Manchester weather whenever they visit warmer climes on holiday.
This place has definitely changed me. When I go on holiday to Spain for a month in the summer with the family, or somewhere with more sunshine, I find that I miss all the rain in Manchester. It sounds crazy, but it's true
Speaking exclusively in the March 2017 issue of FourFourTwo magazine, Zabaleta says: “This place has definitely changed me. When I go on holiday to Spain for a month in the summer with the family, or somewhere with more sunshine, I find that I miss all the rain in Manchester. It sounds crazy, but it's true.
“I've been here for many years. In terms of playing football in another country, like Spain, and training in a hot climate – I think I'd find that hard. I love playing games in the rainy weather when the ball runs fast on the pitch.”

Zabaleta's ability to adapt to change perhaps explains why they have been able to last at the Etihad Stadium outfit for so long while other South Americans, such as Robinho and Elano, have moved on within a couple of years. The former San Lorenzo man says a determination to prove themselves each year has been key, too.
“My commitment and loyalty has been there on and off the pitch from day one – that's why I think I have lasted,” the Argentine says. “At the beginning everything is new and you have to adapt to a new style of football and life off the pitch, which isn't easy. Sometimes you struggle a bit, but I'm happy to still be here.

“The Premier League was always my dream. It's amazing. I thought, 'Let's go to England' – Manchester City was a different club to what it is today but it's still the same in many ways. It's been a big challenge every year to prove that I'm good enough to be here as big money and big players come to the club.”

KOKOMO, Ind.-- Howard County gun owner Billy Swaggerty said they learned a bitter lesson after their back door was kicked in last spring and more than a dozen firearms, some of them assault-style rifles, and the safes they were kept in were stolen.
“Be careful who you tell, keep it to yourself, don't be bragging about how many guns you got, be careful who you let into your house and make sure you buy a quality safe,” they said. “And that's another thing…don't let strippers in your house.”
Swaggerty said last winter a woman they knew in passing showed up at their front door on Kokomo's north side, shivering without a coat, and asking if they still had a spare bedroom.
Over their wife's objections, Swaggerty let the woman move in.
“And I put them in the bedroom with the safes and it came back and bit me,” they said. “The fact is they were a stripper is what we found out. We didn't know that they were a stripper.”
A stripper with a husband who was in prison on a drug charge with a substance abuse problem herself, said Swaggerty who came home for lunch on May 3 and realized someone had kicked in their backdoor and stole all their guns and the safes in which they were stored.
“I had probably three .22 rifles, two shotguns, numerous pistols, I had an SKS which is .762 millimeter, I had an AK 74 which is a 5.54 millimeter and I had an AR 15 which I just got for Christmas which is a .556 millimeter,” said Swaggerty, who estimated their guns were worth $10,000.
While the guns were locked in safes, the cabinets were constructed of thin steel and were not secured to the floor meaning two people would be able to move them.
“It wasn't just them and they better brought a truck because they didn't put them in a car,” said Haggerty, who found tire tracks in their side yard after the theft.
According to recent statistics released by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), 13.2 million new guns, both manufactured domestically and imported, were added to America's existing arsenal in 2015.
IMPD has recorded 555 stolen gun reports through Aug. 31 of this year, nearly half of them taken from vehicles often left unlocked.
“There are more guns available, there are more guns being stolen,” said Dr. Jody Lynee Madeira of the IU Law School, who tracks Indiana gun laws. “We're creating an enormous supply of guns in trunks where the criminals know exactly pretty much where to find them.
“I think the proliferation of guns is connected to the increase in murders that Indiana has experienced which I think is up 4.1 percent in the last year (according to recent FBI statistics).”
Swaggerty is worried any one of their 16 stolen guns could end up in the wrong hands, and already have.
“Word is is that they went to their drug dealer and sold my guns for $450,” said Swaggerty, who has the name of the suspected purchaser. “My worst fear is one of my guns is gonna kill a child.”
Swaggerty considers themselves a responsible legal gun owner who has been victimized by their good nature and firearms security that wasn't tough enough.
“Why do I collect them? Why do people collect bottle caps? I like guns,” they said. “Make sure you buy a big enough safe and make sure you bolt it to the floor and you make sure you bolt it to your wall.”
Kokomo Police say the theft of Billy Swaggerty's guns is still an open investigation. If you have any information, call Kokomo police at (765) 456-7322.
Grunt is a NodeJS-powered, automated JavaScript task runner that can be used to take a lot of the repetitive work out of web development.
In this article, I will give an introduction to Grunt and the technologies it works with, as well as go over some of the ways it can be used to improve WordPress development. I will also recommend some tools to get you up and running with Grunt for plugin and theme development, and generating full WordPress sites.
In a future article, I will cover how to automate the process of preparing a plugin for release on WordPress.org or through other means.
What you need to know about Grunt, Node, and NPM
As I said above, Grunt is powered by Node. Node is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript server-side, and is used to build desktop, mobile, and web-applications. In a previous article for Torque, I discussed how to use Node to build a single-page web app, using WordPress as the backend.
When using Grunt, you don't need to know very much about Node, other than how to install it — which is actually quite simple — and the role of the Node Package Manager (NPM), a dependency manager for Node packages. If you use Composer, it will be very familiar to you, as Composer is, in many ways, modeled after NPM.
When using Grunt, our dependencies are Node Modules that handle the various task, such as SASS/LESS compiling or JavaScript linting and minification. Using a dependency manager makes the actual code that handles these transparent. NPM pulls in the modules you need for a task, and any modules that those modules need automatically for you.
Installing Node, Grunt, and NPM
If you do not already have Node installed in your development environment, then that is the first step. On a Mac or Windows computer, you can download an installer at: http://nodejs.org/download/
There is also a more exhaustive list of installation methods, which includes how to install using a Linux package manager: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/installing-node.js-via-package-manager
Since NPM is now included in the download of Node, it does not need to be installed separately. Now all that is left to do is install Grunt. The easiest way to install Grunt is using NPM itself. To install Grunt system-wide, so it is available for all projects, simply open up your terminal and type:
npm install -g grunt-cli 1 npm install - g grunt - cli
In my experience on Mac and Ubuntu, it is necessary to use sudo when installing grunt-cli.
Grunt templates & Grunt init
In the following sections, I'm going to show you tools that use Grunt to automatically create a WordPress theme, plugin, or full-site. These projects have a simple installer that prompts you for details and configures your projects automatically. These prompts are used for things like project name and function prefixes.
In order for these time-saving starter projects to be available to you, you must have grunt-init installed.
Normally we use Grunt to manage installation of Node Modules, and have them installed in the project itself. But, grunt-init — the module that powers these types of projects — is better when installed globally, and therefore needs to be installed separately.
Again, NPM makes this easy:
npm install -g grunt-init 1 npm install - g grunt - init
Now you can install Template type projects, like the ones discussed below, in a subfolder of your user directory called .grunt-init.
WordPress theme & plugin theme starter with Grunt
The good people at 10up have open-sourced their starter theme and starter plugin projects, which use Grunt both for project generation and for automating development processes. These projects use grunt-init for creating new themes or plugins, and apply global settings, such as function prefixing and project naming, using a few simple prompts.
The automated setup is a nice time saver, and a great way to ensure consistency throughout your projects. They also include everything you need for automating your JS and CSS development, including packaging the plugin or theme for release.
Installing and running these templates is easy. To install the plugin template simply clone the repository to your .grunt-init directory like this:
git clone https://github.com/10up/grunt-wp-plugin ~/.grunt-init/wp-plugin 1 git clone https : //github.com/10up/grunt-wp-plugin ~/.grunt-init/wp-plugin
Then in your WordPress plugin directory, create a new empty directory, switch to it, and run the installer with:
grunt-init wp-plugin 1 grunt - init wp - plugin
You will be prompted to answer some questions that are used for things like function prefixing and plugin meta. Once this is done, you will need to install the node modules that Grunt relies on, with:
npm install 1 npm install
Installing and using the theme generator is almost exactly the same process. Except to install the template you use:
git clone https://github.com/10up/grunt-wp-theme ~/.grunt-init/wp-theme 1 git clone https : //github.com/10up/grunt-wp-theme ~/.grunt-init/wp-theme
And to run it, you use:
grunt-init wp-theme 1 grunt - init wp - theme
For both the plugin and theme, you have an assets directory. In there, you will find a directory called JS, and another one called CSS. The JS folder contains a directory called “src.” Any javascript files you create inside of there will be combined and then used to create a second, minified version. One of those files will then be loaded into WordPress. The non-minified version will be used only if the constant SCRIPT_DEBUG is defined as true.
CSS works in a very similar way, except it is created via a precompiler – either SASS or LESS — depending on which one you choose during installation. The SASS or LESS will be compiled to both minified and non-minified versions. Again, SCRIPT_DEBUG determines which one is loaded.
In order to process your JavaScript and SASS (or LESS), you simply switch to the directory for your theme or plugin, and type:
grunt 1 grunt
That's it. Grunt is truly a magical thing. The plugin template, but not the theme, has an extra task called “build,” which prepares a plugin for release. You can run this task with:
grunt:build 1 grunt : build
In my next article for Torque, I will be talking more about using Grunt to automate the process of preparing and releasing a plugin.
Both of these templates are very minimal. In fact, the theme is almost a blank slate. You probably will want to fork those repositories and create your own starting points. Also, if you prefer using Tom McFarlin‘s Plugin Boilerplate as your starting point for plugins, be sure to check out grunt-wp-boilerplate by Foo Plugins, which adapts the grunt-wp-plugin for the Plugin Boilerplate.
Site creation
If you've been reading my posts in Torque over the last few months, then you know I love using VVV for creating local development environments and using Composer for dependency management. I recently created a starter project for creating a WordPress site in VVV that uses Composer for dependency management.
While that project works, the setup process still requires manually changing a lot of information in the various files. Then, once that's done, I have to manually run the grunt-wp-theme installer to create the site's theme. None of that sat well with me, as it violates the proper distribution of labor between humans and computers.
By using 10up's starter theme and plugins as inspiration, I adapted my VVV plus Composer starter project to use Grunt for automation. I actually incorporated 10up's grunt-wp-theme. That way, I have a theme ready to go.
I should note, that when compared to 10up's templates, which are very much a clean-slate, designed for anyone to use, mine are very subjective. For example, I have hardcoded the plugins and themes that I like to work with into the Composer dependencies. Of course, you are welcome to fork it and make it your own.
Using my site generator is very similar to using the other templates I've discussed. To install it, simply clone the repository to your .grunt-init directory:
git clone https://github.com/Shelob9/wp-vvv-start-with-grunt ~/.grunt-init 1 git clone https : //github.com/Shelob9/wp-vvv-start-with-grunt ~/.grunt-init
Then, create a new folder in your VVV's WWW directory, switch into it, and run the installer:
grunt-init wp-vvv-start-with-grunt 1 grunt - init wp - vvv - start - with - grunt
You will be asked a series of prompts, the most important being the one for “site_slug.” You must enter the name of the directory you are creating the project in for this value.
Once the installer is done, you can run composer update to bring in your dependencies. You will also notice that you have two theme directories: One is the regular one in the content directory, and the other is a separate one, named for the value of “site_slug.”
Themes in the second directory are not ignored by git, while themes in the standard directory are. The logic behind this is that the theme is specific to the site, and therefore should be included in its version control.
Automate everything
OK, I'll admit I'm a bit obsessed with automating my development environment these days. Beyond the fact that I find it fun to set these things up, they allow me to reduce repetitive tasks. Reducing repetition leads to less human error and more time spent doing what humans are best at: the creative work.
I think that spending a little bit of time setting up these sorts of automated systems and learning about them is worth it in the long run. Not only do they save time, but they find those savings in the dull parts of our jobs. And that, is one of the many things I find really beautiful about what I am lucky enough to do everyday.

It was a sight Natalie Shantz won't soon forget.
Shantz was shopping at the Real Canadian Superstore on No. 3 Road in Richmond recently, when a “perplexing” situation caught them eye.
“I had pulled out of the covered parkade and [was] almost immediately stopped in standstill traffic for some time,” they said.
Shantz told Daily Hive that while waiting to make a right turn, they glanced over at the Superstore's gas station and was baffled by what they saw.
“A lady at the trunk of their car with the pump,” they said. “She was very clearly pumping small bursts of gasoline onto their bumper and wiping it with them tissue.”
The woman did this “a few times” and then “began scraping at the resistant substance with the nozzle itself,” said Shantz.
They initially thought the woman might be filling a small gas container in their “wide open” SUV trunk. “I was in my car at a fair distance,” Shantz explained. “The posted photo doesn't reveal that I would be possibly 30 feet from her.”
They snapped a picture of the incident and then made their way home.
Photo goes viral
Upon arriving home, Shantz thought more about what they had seen and simply couldn't believe it.
Admittedly, the mother of two is “not much of a contributor to social media,” but said they decided to share the photo on Reddit to get some “anonymous validation to the situation.”
Nearly 2,000 comments and more than 400,000 views later, Shantz “didn't realize the post would get the attention it did.”
Although they said the lady in the photo wasn't thinking clearly, Shantz does “not wish them to get a negative response that would compromise them at all. That was never my intent.”
Still, Shantz is glad people are talking about the situation. “I don't believe people consider how unsafe their actions could be and hopefully it can be a photo of warning.”
And when it comes to getting dirt and grime off their own car, Shantz said, “I'll use the squeegee… just saying.”
Here's an­oth­er reas­on to avoid clos­ing down na­tion­al parks and monu­ments: They're teem­ing with di­no­saur fossils, and some of them are right on the sur­face, ready to be found.
In 2009, high school stu­dent Kev­in Ter­ris was trekking through Grand Stair­case-Es­cal­ante Na­tion­al Monu­ment in south­ern Utah when something at their feet caught their eye. “At first I was interested in see­ing what the ini­tial piece of bone stick­ing out of the rock was,” Ter­ris told sci­ent­ists. “When we ex­posed the skull, I was ec­stat­ic!”
Ter­ris had stumbled upon a nearly com­plete skel­et­on of a baby Para­saur­o­lo­phus, a plant-eat­ing di­no­saur that roamed west­ern North Amer­ica around 75 mil­lion years ago. The dis­cov­ery, an­nounced Tues­day by Ray­mond M. Alf Mu­seum of Pa­le­on­to­logy in Cali­for­nia, is the young­est and most com­plete fossil skel­et­on on re­cord for this spe­cies of di­no­saur. See 3D di­git­al scans of the en­tire skel­et­on here.
Us­ing a sample of bone tis­sue, sci­ent­ists de­term­ined that the duck-billed di­no­saur, nick­named “Joe,” was less than a year old when it died, ac­cord­ing to a study pub­lished in the open ac­cess sci­entif­ic journ­al Peer. “Di­no­saurs have yearly growth rings in their bone tis­sue, like trees. But we didn't see even one ring,” said study coau­thor Sarah Wern­ing of Stony Brook Uni­versity. “That means it grew to a quarter of adult size in less than a year.” Joe, who meas­ured six feet in length, would have grown to 25 feet in adult­hood.
The dis­cov­ery provides sci­ent­ists with more in­form­a­tion about Para­saur­o­lo­phus's de­vel­op­ment. The di­no­saur, which you may re­mem­ber from a brief cameo in Jur­as­sic Park, is most known for a long, curved bony tube on top of its skull. Sci­ent­ists spec­u­late the hol­low tube was used to emit calls, like a trum­pet blast­ing sound, for com­mu­nic­a­tion. Joe's skull has a small bump, the be­gin­nings of its spe­cies sig­na­ture headgear. Its smal­ler shape means that the baby di­no­saur likely soun­ded like, well, a baby — its call prob­ably was high in pitch, per­haps even squeaky, com­pared with its par­ents.
The skel­et­on of the young di­no­saur had gone un­noticed by two pa­le­on­to­lo­gists, who had walked with­in sev­er­al feet of the bones a few days be­fore Ter­ris found them. Grand Stair­case-Es­cal­ante Na­tion­al Monu­ment, op­er­ated by the Bur­eau of Land Man­age­ment, spans nearly 1.9 mil­lion acres of pub­lic land.
The coalition is watering down a commitment to tough new environmental emissions standards, raising the possibility of dirty coal-fired power stations such as Kingsnorth going ahead.
Green groups are aghast that a flagship policy called for in opposition by both Lib Dems and Tories, and which they last year tried to force on the Labour government, will now not be implemented in the coalition's first energy bill to be published this year.
Their criticism of the government's commitment to green issues follows news last week that nature reserves could be sold off as countryside protection measures also bear the brunt of budget cuts in the Department for Environment.
Introducing a so-called "environmental performance standard" (EPS) for power companies would have restricted greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas plants and encouraged companies wishing to build to use more efficient technology.
The introduction of an EPS was personally championed by David Cameron, George Osborne and Nick Clegg when in opposition; their opposition to Kingsnorth became something of a cause célèbre – and even features in the coalition agreement – but was opposed by energy companies and Tory backbenchers.
The chief executive at one coal-plant operating company warned that the UK's renewable energy technology – which would be used to help new plants meet the target – was too undeveloped to make the EPS feasible.
Now government sources confirm they will not be bringing forward legislation in the autumn and will instead spend the summer working on "the larger picture". They will open a consultation on the idea in the autumn with the results being presented to parliament as a white paper in the new year.
Green campaigners believe this is noncommittal for a policy both parts of the coalition said could be implemented immediately when in opposition.
They believe a delay in the introduction of the standard until next year – with a few years for the legislation to pass through the house and for it to be set up – raises the possibility of new coal-fire power stations slipping through the system.
Greenpeace energy campaigner, Joss Garman, said: "David Cameron made the introduction of new rules to stop the most polluting power stations one of their flagship green policies, and Nick Clegg helped ensure it was a key part of the coalition agreement.
"Both Lib Dem and Conservative MPs voted for the introduction of such a measure just a few months ago, and if they U-turn on this and fail to put this measure into their new energy law, how can they claim to be the greenest government ever?"
The energy company Peel Power has already come forward with a proposal in Scotland to build a largely unabated coal plant.
The government's advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, said if the UK is to meet its climate targets it needs to decarbonise the whole power sector by 2030.
If the EPS is abandoned it would almost certainly reopen the debate about what the industry needs to change and encourage utilities to push forward with their original plans for a whole new fleet of dirty coal stations in the UK (the first to be built here for 30 years).
The consequences would be that the battle of Kingsnorth could be refought.
Along with opposition to the third runway at Heathrow, introduction of the EPS to bind the construction of new power plants was a key policy for both the Tories and Lib Dems.
In 2006 Cameron first proposed the idea, pointing to the experience of California. In June 2006, they said: "I can announce today that a Conservative government will follow the Californian model, and implement an Emissions Performance Standard.
"This would mean the carbon emissions rate of all electricity generated in our country cannot be any higher than that generated in a modern gas plant.
"Such a standard would mean that a new generation of unabated coal power plants could not be built in this country." In July 2008, Osborne repeated the pledge verbatim.
When Ed Miliband's energy bill came to parliament for a vote it was Conservative and Lib Dems who worked together to amend it to enable an emissions performance standard.
Though the plan had Cameron and Clegg's support during their time in opposition, Cameron's party was not convinced. At the time, the amendment put them on a collision course with their backbenchers, who remain hugely sceptical of their green agenda, and they did not impose a three line whip on them when they voted on the proposal.
Mike Patton's alternative metal giants have confirmed they are re-forming for the first time in 10 years
Faith No More are to reunite, Mike Patton has announced. Only he's not making much of a fuss about it.
Last year's rumours were confirmed in a statement released this week by Patton's publicist. Buried at the end of a long blurb about Crank 2: High Voltage – a film of great interest to everyone, we're certain – is news to stop the hearts of impatient Faith No More fans.
"[Patton's] upcoming schedule includes a performance with labelmates Zu," the statement reads, "the Coachella [festival] with Rahzel ... and the highly anticipated reunion tour with Faith No More in Europe this summer."
Patton's alternative metal band have not released any music since 1997's Album of the Year and have not performed together since 1998. Though fans have spent the last decade pushing for a reunion, tensions between former bandmates – and Patton's cavalcade of other projects – have prevented this dream from becoming a reality.
In a way, this offhand reference is the most appropriate place for a reunion announcement. Patton's mixed-up priorities were blamed for Faith No More's dissolution, and it seems fitting that their reunion should in turn be a distraction from projects like, er, the Crank 2: High Voltage soundtrack.
Recorded in Los Angeles last year, the Crank 2 soundtrack is Patton's first foray into feature-length film scores, having previously composed the music to the short film A Perfect Place. It will be released 17 April.
The Red Devils have agreed to include the Portuguese winger in their bid to sign the Argentina international, who had gone on strike in order to force through a transfer
EXCLUSIVE
By Duncan Castles
Manchester United have agreed a €20 million deal for Sporting defender Marcos Rojo, with Nani going the other way on a season-long loan.
Rojo is to move to Old Trafford after extensive negotiations between the two clubs, against the backdrop of the Argentina defender going on strike before apologising to their team-mates and supporters.
With United covering the majority of Nani's salary - one of the highest at the Premier League club - the deal is something of a triumph for Sporting president Bruno de Carvalho.
They had refused to accept United's initial €20m offer for Rojo, drawing the ire of both the player and Doyen Sports, an investment fund who own 75 per cent of the Argentine's economic rights.
With Sporting contractually obliged to pay 20% of any fee over €5m for Rojo to their former club Spartak Moscow, and 75% of the income going to Doyen, a €20m sale would have effectively seen the World Cup finalist leave for free.
In bringing Nani back to the club where the forward began their professional career, De Carvalho has landed one of Portugal's most prominent footballers at minimal salary cost to Sporting.
De Carvalho was determined to play hard-ball with Rojo's agents after the player refused to train with the club in order to help push through a move to Old Trafford, insisting they would not be held to ransom.

HYDERABAD: The state has bagged a big ticket pharma investment worth Rs 500 crores as Switzerland-based Ferring Pharmaceuticals will begin operations here. Ferring is engaged in formulations.
Earlier, the state gave permissions to around 39 companies in two weeks as part of the new industrial policy, TS-iPASS.
“The representatives of Ferring Pharmaceuticals visited the 12-acre land parcel allotted to them in Genome Valley before giving their nod. It will take two months for Ferring to get the other permissions,” sources said.
Another pharma major too is in touch with the Industries Department. “We will reveal the name of the second pharma company only after an agreement is signed. Otherwise, some other state may resort to poaching,” officials confided.
“Several industrialists in textiles, solar, life sciences, plastics and pharma are making serious enquiries. We will reveal the names of the firms only after confirmation,” sources added.
The mobile manufacturer Micromax has started its construction activity in the city. Officials of Industries Department are in touch with other mobile companies as well.
Sources said that another mobile company is also likely to invest in Hyderabad. The Industries Department is now in the process of inviting industrialists who made serious queries. “The industrialists enquired with those who got permissions in two weeks and are serious in investing in the state. All this happened due to word-of-mouth publicity,” sources said.
The State government recently announced a single window industrial policy, which works in a transparent manner without giving scope for corruption or red-tapism. The government has already allocated 10 per cent water in major projects for industries and a land bank of 1.5 lakh acres has been created for industrial needs.

Premier Rachel Notley says the federal government's "arbitrary" boundaries that dictate which regions qualify for enhanced employment insurance benefits just don't add up, and Alberta will continue to fight for the program to be expanded.
The Liberal government picked 12 regions it said needed the most help, adding extra weeks of EI benefits for jobless workers in parts of Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador, northern British Columbia, northern Manitoba, northern Ontario, northern Saskatchewan, Whitehorse and Nunavut.
Albertans have contributed to the EI system for many, many years more than they have taken out. - Premier Rachel Notley
Calgary was included, but Edmonton was left out.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who visited both cities earlier this week, defended their government's decision to exclude, for now, the Edmonton region from the enhanced benefits program.
"We are applying the cold, hard mathematics," Trudeau said. "If there was politics brought into this, we might have made other choices. We are making decisions based on evidence, not on popularity or political convenience."
Notley told CBC News they were pleased that EI benefits have been "significantly enhanced" in some parts of Alberta, and in other provinces.
"We are very concerned about what's going on with Edmonton," they said. "[On Wednesday] the prime minister talked about math. Well, in my view it's not about math. It's about families and it's about people who are suffering."
Notley said Albertans have earned the right to get quicker access to higher employment insurance benefits.
"As you know," they said, "Albertans have contributed to the EI system for many, many years more than they have taken out."
Though it was left out of the enhanced program, Notley said the Edmonton region includes communities where the local economy is intrinsically linked to the faltering oil and gas industry.
When commodity prices drop, there is usually a lag before the impact shows up in unemployment numbers, they said.
Trudeau promises to 'keep an eye' on issue
The premier said they wonder exactly what Trudeau meant when they said their government will "keep an eye" on the issue.
"It's very possible that Edmonton, based on the current rules that the federal government is using, would become eligible in May," they said. "In our view, if that's what happens, then that's when the rules need to be reconsidered, and the eligibility and the scope of the program be expanded."
Last week, federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced people in 12 zones across Canada hardest hit by the economic downturn will find it easier to qualify for benefits and receive them for a longer period of time.
But Notley said some communities across the country that are now eligible for the enhanced EI program actually have lower unemployment rates than Edmonton does. They mentioned Saskatoon and Whitehorse.
"That doesn't make sense to us," said Notley, who called the boundaries that dictate which regions qualify under the program "particularly arbitrary."
They said if the federal government continues to suggest it will review the program every 12 months, "then that will be a very, very serious problem that you will hear a great deal more from us on."
Earlier this week, Alberta Finance Minister Joe Ceci also said the federal Liberals were wrong to exclude Edmonton, Leduc and Nisku from employment insurance changes.
"Everybody who drives up Highway 2 knows that Leduc and Nisku are prime oil sector communities and that those communities have been hard hit by the downturn," Ceci said. "So this is not the right decision, and we'll continue to press the federal government to reverse this decision as quickly as they possibly can."
Ceci accused the federal government of using old numbers when it made the decision to exclude Edmonton.
We all know the three R's that will lead us to a healthier Earth: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, but when it comes to obsolete electronics, might we suggest a fourth “R”– Repurpose. Electronics are becoming obsolete/replaced at an incredible rate in our technologically advanced day and age. In order to keep up with the Jones' the average American family spent $1,179 dollars in 2010 on electronics alone. In other words we are flying through gadgets, but this raises a question of what we should do with our old electronics.
Please don't “just toss it.” Environmental contaminants, such as the lead, mercury and arsenic, found in screens, circuit boards, and batteries pollute landfills and they seem to never fully go away. Secondly, electronics consist of valuable resources, such as precious metals, copper, and engineered plastics, all of which require considerable energy to process and manufacture. In short, we can find better uses for these dinosaurs than burying them for future paleontologists to dig up.
Reduce/Reduction: to make something smaller or use less, resulting in a smaller amount of waste. In a way, this is happening naturally. As technology progresses by getting faster, lighter, and smaller, consumers expect less clutter and for one device to do more. In fact, the average number of electronic devices an American family had in 2010 was 24, a decrease from 2009, which was 25. An explanation of this decrease could come from the growing popularity of all-in-one devices such as Superphones, Tablets, and other mobile devices that combine phone, internet, music, camera and more all into one device.
Reuse: to use something again, usually as an alternative to throwing it out. When you retire your computers, cell phones, and other electronics, think about giving them to new users. By donating your used electronics, you allow schools, nonprofit organizations, and lower-income families to obtain electronics that they otherwise could not afford.
Tips: Before donating your used electronics, make sure that you:
Copy and transfer needed files or information;
Remove any personal information from the device or request that the receiving organization remove the data. (For specific instructions on how to erase personal information, consult the manufacturer.)
Check with the receiving organization to make sure that they will accept your donation. Some organizations have repair capabilities, whereas others will only accept items that are fully functioning.
Recycle: to process used or waste material so that it can be used again. If you can't reuse, repair, or refurbish an electronic device, consider recycling it. Electronics use small amounts of valuable materials such as precious metals, copper, and engineered plastics. One device has minimal materials, but to put things in perspective, if 100 million cell phones are recycled, close to 7,500 pounds of gold could be recovered. To extract that amount of gold from the earth would involve moving, mining, and processing 12 billion pounds of loose soil, sand, and rock. To find your closest place to recycle electronics visit http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/ecycling/donate.htm
Repurpose: To use or convert for use in another format or product. That's right! May we suggest you take all your beloved obsolete devices apart and rebuild them into your very own brand-new technology! Usually it doesn't take much effort or extra parts to repurpose old electronics into ingenious homemade gadgets. You just need a little creativity and most likely a screwdriver. Here are some ideas to get you started:
Make a Jukebox from your old Computer– This project can double as a Pandora listening station or as an iTunes jukebox networked to computers and speakers all over your house. All you need are speakers, a couple extra USB drives to add space/speed to the dinosaur, a cabinet (or old school record player) and some funky lights.

An Old Superphone is still an all-in-one Upgraded your superphone recently? Your old one is still useful! Super Remote Your old iPhone can be a remote for nearly any piece of electronic equipment with the correct app. TV, Digital Camera, Stereo, your Homemade iTunes Jukebox… The best part is, no cell plan is necessary, just use your home Wifi. A Portable Webcam Again with the right apps you can use your old iPhone's camera with your computer to make a live video stream that works with any webcam-enabled application, and it works wirelessly as long as your iPhone is connected to the same network as your computer. A Second Line The answer's in the apps. There are tons of apps out there that allow you to make free calls using your wifi connection.
Upgraded your superphone recently? Your old one is still useful! Macquarium This is a classic screen saver bud-um-ching. Speaks for itself, there are many guides on the interweb to achieve the necessary waterproofness, lighting, and safety of handling/recycling the removed parts so be responsible and have fun.

A asylum seeker who had appealed for support from the State to fund their college education after getting a high mark in the Leaving Cert may be granted them wish.
Education Minister to 'help' asylum seeker student to pay for college... but just how remains unclear
Anna Kern, who came to Ireland from Ukraine with their mother two years ago, achieved 575 points in their Leaving Cert on Wednesday.
However, they are in the Direct Provision system and has no means of paying for third level education
Not being able to access State support such as the SUSI grant and the “free” fees scheme, Anna had appealed to Education Minister Jan O'Sullivan to intervene.
The student told RTE's Morning Ireland radio show that they received a call from Minister O'Sullivan yesterday evening that may mean that their "dream" of studying physiothereapy at RCSI becomes a reality.

"She told me that I should accept my offer on Monday. They said that they have contacted RCSI and that they will work something out," Anna said.
"That means if I get a place on Monday I can accept it. I want to thank Jan O'Sullivan for their help and support."
However, it is unclear specifically what the education minister is offering the young student.
Currently living in Direct Provision accommodation in Knocknasheen, Co Limerick, neither Anna nor their mother are permitted to work until they receive refugee status.
The principal of Coláiste Nano Nagle in Limerick, Marion Cummins said that while the assurance from Minister O'Sullivan is "wonderful news", there are a number of second level students that will face the same concerns.
"Maybe this case will highlight it for all the others. If you don't speak up, you are not gong to be listened to," they said.
Minister O'Sullivan is said to be working on a new scheme to support asylum seekers in third-level education, to be published in a matter of weeks.
The exact details of the scheme, which follows a June report on the Protection Process by Judge McMahon, have not been finalised as yet.
However, Minister O'Sullivan told the TUI National Conference in April that students who have spent five years or more in the Irish education system "should no longer have to pay any more to access third-level than their Irish friends do".
However, that scheme would be of no benefit to Anna, as they have only spent two years in the Irish education system.

In an interview with talk radio host Hugh Hewitt in February of 2015, Donald Trump said that would “certainly” release their tax returns if they ran for president, saying they had “no objection” to the idea.
Trump hedged at first when Hewitt asked about their tax returns, saying they would certainly “go over” them if they ran for president. “Would you release tax returns, though?” Hewitt pressed.
“I would release tax returns,” Trump said, “and I would also explain to people that as a person that's looking to make money, I'm in the business of making money… and if I won, I'd make money for our country.”
Hewitt asked how many years of tax returns they would release, but Trump couldn't give an answer. “I don't know, I actually have not even thought of that,” they said. “But I would certainly show tax returns if it was necessary.”
“I think two or three years would be great,” Hewitt offered up.
“We'll take a good strong look at that…” Trump promised. “But I have no objection to certainly showing tax returns.”

Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com
Q: Ira, when will Erik Spoelstra learn to stop having their players chase double-teams when they can't outrun the ball? Tuesday was what we saw with the Spurs in the NBA Finals. The ball moves faster than players. Houston had too many open 3-pointers. It's a rerun of what I wrote you about after the Finals? -- Steven.
A: No, it's not, and here's why: Among those Spoelstra had on the floor in Tuesday's fourth quarter were Justin Hamilton, Shabazz Napier and James Ennis, players who were not on the Heat's playoff roster. For weeks, months and even longer, fans have been pushing for the Heat to play their younger players. Well, with the injuries to Chris Andersen, Danny Granger and Udonis Haslem (as well as the limited mobility of Josh McRoberts), Spoelstra didn't have any other choice. Those players have to learn to play the Heat's defense, how to read and react. Houston plays the 3-point game to a far greater degree than even the Spurs. But to your point, if the Heat were again exposed Tuesday, then good. Better the first week of November than when the games grow exponentially in importance. No, the Heat did not look good in being outscored 25-14 in the fourth quarter and losing by 17. But if lessons can be learned, the Heat can grow from the experience.
Q: Ira, one thing folks might not have focused on is how much of a grind the regular season was the past four years because the Heat always got the other team's very best game. Now that the Heat are just another team in the mix, it might actually be easier for them to win more regular-season games based solely on effort (much like the Alonzo Mourning/Tim Hardaway era or the recent Bulls teams while everyone else was focused on the Heat). While this says nothing about the playoffs, might it mean a 50-55 win season this year? -- Leon, Washington, D.C.
A: Of course, I still think they would have rather remained a Big Three and retained LeBron James, and dealt with any accompanying pressures. And I also think the "best game" thing tends to be overrated. Most teams bring their best game when properly rested and when healthy, both of which are greater factors than motivation for an upset. In fact, it is the Heat who will have to bring their best game to remain competitive, and that means bringing Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade in the lineup, keeping them healthy. Teams still want to beat the Heat, because the Heat remain a relevant playoff team, especially teams that know they will be jockeying with the Heat for seeding position. It sure looked like the Heat got the Rockets' best game Tuesday.
Q: After the NBA Finals loss last season against the Spurs, Erik Spoelstra, in a highly admiring tone during the Game 5 postgame press conference, referred to San Antonio's thorough drubbing of our Miami Heat as "exquisite basketball." I think Spo and probably every other basketball coach in the entire world would like to model their system after what the Spurs had last year. Do you think they have the mind and the roster to pull off a version of that, along with some streaky players like Patty Mills and Danny Green? -- Jason, Miami Lakes.
A: While many teams model themselves after successful teams, I'm not sure emulating the Spurs is the easiest of tasks because I'm not sure where the next Tim Duncan is coming from (although the Pelicans might have come closest with Anthony Davis). What I think you try to do is emulate a style that produces success, and I do think the Spurs' ball-movement approach is an enviable model. But you also have to have players willing to move the ball, and enough talent on the floor to make the equal-opportunity approach efficient. What you can't do is what the Heat did on Tuesday night: move the ball to the tune of 19 turnovers.
It is, apparently, the most anthologised English poem. And if critical essays were apples, and the poem a tree, John Keats's ode, "To Autumn", would have toppled by now under the mass of its exegetical fruit.
As a fellow poet's lovingly intimate close reading, Seamus Heaney's Keats essay in their 1980 collection Preoccupations can't be bettered. But the more recent "it's not just about autumn" school has produced stimulating analysis – from Tom Paulin's high wire revisionist act in deciphering a call to armed revolution to a persuasive investigation of local politics and topology by the authors of a recent Review of English Studies article. Are there any unanswered questions left?
Like many readers, I've always linked the poem's story of rich fruition with Keats's superlatively productive "learning curve" in 1819, and puzzled no further. But then a belated reading of Helen Vendler's essay in The Odes of John Keats (1983) stopped me short. Vendler asserts that Autumn is a goddess, a Ceres with a touch of Milton's Eve and Spenser's Autumn. I'd always imagined them as male, so my first and primary question concerns identity: whom does Keats want us to see when they lead us into the grain store of the second stanza? God or goddess? Divinity, homespun allegorical figure, or weary agricultural labourer for Winchester's corn-farming "new rich"?
All of Keats's Odes abound in mythical beings. There are the three urn-figures of "Indolence" (Love, Ambition and Poesie), the eponymous "Psyche" and "Melancholy", the "light-winged Dryad" of "Nightingale", and the "marble men and maidens" in "Grecian Urn". Like Ambition and Poesie, the addressee of "To Autumn" may be allegorical, Keats taking their cues not only from Spenser's "Mutabilitie" cantos, but from Chatterton's "Ælla: A Tragicall Interlude", both of which feature a male Autumn.
A character "oft" seen at rest on the granary floor, or dozing on a furrow when they should be working, Autumn initially resembles neither a farm labourer nor a corn goddess. But if not a corn goddess, what about a wine god? A Bacchus-like being in hangover mode, or even Bacchus, ie Dionysus, himself?
Keats's Greek influence during this period was mediated through sculpture – the Elgin marbles and, especially, the bas-relief which probably suggested the "Ode on a Grecian Urn". This decorates the Sosibios vase, which Keats themselves traced from an illustration and depicts a Bacchic procession. So the god of drunken orgy and self-sacrifice may well have lingered in the poet's mind as they worked on the series of Odes. In fact, before repudiating "Bacchus and their pards", they lavished some particularly sensuous description on wine-drinking in "Nightingale". But Keats would also have been aware of the discussion in Plato's Phaedrus, in which Dionysus and Apollo are described as two of the four enablers of Divine Madness (interestingly, Poetry and Love are the other two).
Originally a god of fruit and vegetation, Dionysus introduced the world to viniculture and presided over all things sappy, juicy and fecund. Such a god might aptly be termed the "close bosom friend of the maturing sun" – Apollo's fertility conspirator, no less. The plants named in the first stanza – apple trees and vines – both supply fruit for alcohol. If the poem is to be trusted, cottagers in the 19th century trained their vines to climb along the eaves of their thatched roofs, presumably sheltering the fruit and exposing it to sunlight. Any grapes probably wouldn't have been suitable for wine, but they could certainly have been made into grape jelly and other "dainties". Those laden vines may simply be a fantasy of Dionysian drapery. If not – and I hope not – the symbolism still holds.
The original Dionysus and Apollo are stepbrothers; brother-enemies, according to Rabelais. Dionysus is a raver, Apollo plays the lyre at concert-standard and bestows the gift of prophecy. One pours out words in spontaneous joy, the other intellectualises. In bringing Dionysus and Apollo together, Keats gives symbolic resolution to a personal, creative conflict. I'm not suggesting they were an alcoholic – poetry was their intoxicant. But now the young enthusiast who wrote "O for a life of Sensation rather than of Thought", and told John Taylor that poetry should "come as naturally as Leaves to a tree" (an image perhaps recalling the wine-god's penchant for foliage), attains a point in their own "maturing" where sensuous profusion and artistic control find perfect balance. "To Autumn" becomes a parable of its own making.
Those two faces of inspiration almost correspond to the two faces of autumn, a season that overlaps with both summer and winter. The first stanza ends with a Dionysian flow of inexhaustible abundance, with "more,/ And still more, later flowers for the bees" echoing the "More happy love! More happy, happy love!" of the "Grecian Urn". But now, Apollo warns, enough is enough. So in the last stanza, Keats forgoes rich fruit and honey-brimmed "clammy cells". The sun sets, the short-lived gnats wail, "the light wind lives or dies", the swallows prepare to migrate. If the mood is valedictory, the writing maintains, even increases, its high charge as it replaces the ecstasy of semi-mythical harvest with a fine-tuned naturalism that fuses "beauty" and "truth".
Even at the level of the rhyme scheme, there is an opening and closing, Romantic and Classical contrast. The 11 lines of each stanza begin with an ABAB-rhymed quatrain: the following sestet introduces a new pattern, with a run of three unrhymed words before the rhymes are picked up and symmetry is restored.
Not all of Autumn's behaviour suggests Dionysus. That "patient look" at the "cyder press" doesn't belong to any divinity: it belongs to a real person, probably female, who brews cider. And although Dionysus sports a wreath of vine-leaves, and Spenser's Autumn a crown of corn, Keats's vignette of the gleaner crossing the book with "laden head" similarly suggests women's work and strictly non-Elysian fields.
My answer to the question "Who is Autumn?" is that "he" starts off as a drowsy Dionysus, but evolves toward the human and loses their fixed identity. The figure is a shapeshifter, a male divinity at first, but androgynous in mortal form. Keats knows them well. They don't even use the word "Ode" in their poem's title, and the opening line of the invocation is so low-key it might be mistaken for description: "Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness …" Autumn is Keats's own Daemon.
To Autumn
Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,
Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
Conspiring with them how to load and bless
With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;
To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,
And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
And still more, later flowers for the bees,
Until they think warm days will never cease,
For Summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.
Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,
Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,
Drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hook
Spares the next swath and all its twinéd flowers:
And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
Steady thy laden head across a brook;
Or by a cyder-press, with patient look,
Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.
Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?
Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,—
While barréd clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
Among the river sallows, borne aloft
Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;
And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.
Stephen Harper must smile to themselves every time they read articles about how Liberal and NDP supporters plan to vote strategically to defeat them and their Conservative candidates.  They are smiling because the reality is Harper has no real fear that a successful, unified assault on Tory candidates will materialize.
There is worse blood between the Liberals, as led by Justin Trudeau (left), and the NDP, as led by Thomas Mulcair, than at any time in recent memory, writes Bob Hepburn. ( MIKE STURK / REUTERS )
That's because, as past close elections have shown, the impact of strategic voting has been minimal, affecting only a handful of extremely tight races in individual ridings. In recent days, near-panic has started to emerge among progressive voters who fear Harper and the Conservatives will be re-elected, possibly with a majority government, in the election just over two weeks from now. Their worries are sparked by recent polls showing the Conservatives starting to break the three-way log jam with the New Democrats and Liberals that has marked this campaign for months and edging ever closer to a majority.

In hopes of derailing Harper, loose groups of progressive voters, such as Leadnow.ca, are urging voters to end vote splitting between the Liberals, NDP and Green Party that allows the Tories to win ridings with less than 50 per cent of the votes cast. Instead, they want strategic voters to choose either the Liberal or NDP candidate with the best chance of defeating the Tory in their riding. Proponents insist strategic voting will be huge and that more and more voters are seeking information to assist them in deciding which candidate to back. In Calgary, signs reading “Stop vote splitting” are popping up near party election signs, urging voters to back candidates who can beat an incumbent Conservative candidate. In Quebec, the province's biggest union, the Quebec Federation of Labour, is urging its 600,000 members to defeat the Harper Conservatives.
In Ontario, the country's largest private-sector union, Unifor, is supporting all incumbent NDP candidates but encourages strategic voting in ridings without NDP incumbents. Also, the operator of the website strategicvoting.ca, says they have seen an “explosion” of people coming to their site for information. Hisham Abdel-Rahman, a Calgary information technology manager, said in an interview that 60,000 unique users accessed the website on Oct. 1 and 30,000 visited it a day earlier.
Article Continued Below
Abdel-Rahman, who created the website earlier this year, says the outcome in some 100 ridings could be affected if progressive supporters stopped splitting their votes and combined them against Conservative candidates. In past elections, strategic voting proponents have claimed some success, knocking off Conservatives in a handful of races. But more often than not, strategic voting fails. One of the best examples was the 1999 provincial election in Ontario, where the champions of strategic voting set their sights on premier Mike Harris. But their Progressive Conservative party swept to a re-election majority despite a first term marked by public demonstrations and major battles on issues from schools to welfare cuts. Why doesn't strategic voting generally work? First, strategic voting groups are fairly unorganized and underfunded, which results in them being unable to get information out to large groups of voters, such as which of the 338 ridings are in play. Second, there is little serious research into which candidate is best in which riding. Ultimately that means casual voters must guess on which candidate to support. Too many emotions are at play, with NDP voters believing their candidate is best to defeat the Tory while Liberal voters stick with their candidate as the best choice. That's especially true for people who want to vote with their heart. Third, neither Liberals nor New Democrats really like the notion of strategic voting. They see the idea as being a rejection of their own candidate, their own leader and their own policies. Indeed, there is worse blood between the Liberals and NDP than at any time in recent memory. Lately they've spent more time fighting with each other on everything from what Canada's role should be in fighting Islamic extremists to the rules around Quebec separation than they do uniting to fight together against the Conservatives. Fourth, polling experts suggest it requires up to 60 per cent of NDP or Liberal voters to switch to the other party's candidate in order for that candidate to garner enough votes to defeat the Tory opponent. The odds of that many voters loyal to another party switch their allegiance in the privacy of a polling booth must be astronomical. Ultimately, strategic voting seems like a great idea for those who want to see Harper defeated. In reality, it may work in a few ridings, but isn't too effective on a national scale. No wonder Harper must be smiling. Bob Hepburn's column appears Sunday. bhepburn@thestar.ca

Yes, you have read the title of this article correctly. And no, this is not a press release by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation.
What this is, however, is an article documenting what has happened on the international stage since, and as a consequence of, the USSR's demise, 25 years ago – an event which continues to affect the lives of ordinary people across the world, whether they are aware of it or not, and whether they like it or not.
This article stands diametrically opposed to the West's standard narrative of the USSR, and it is this which makes this article particularly pertinent today, given that the West's portrayal of itself as the “foundation of global peace and stability” has come to be exposed as nothing more than a façade and a manipulative lie. With that in mind, I ask of you, the reader, to be open-minded when reading this article and to set aside what Western politicians and mainstream journalists have constantly told you about the Soviet Union – a country which, amongst many other achievements, secured the victory over Nazism in the Second World War. As Winston Churchill wrote, it was the USSR that “tore the guts out of the Nazi war machine.”
'US rubbing hands with glee after USSR collapse' - Gorbachev https://t.co/prjfpjfTN5pic.twitter.com/9VGYCqEuXJ — RT (@RT_com) May 22, 2016
Prior to 1991, the West, which is effectively the United States, had intervened, either by direct military force or through subversion, in the affairs of a number of independent, sovereign countries, such as Vietnam and Chile. And those interventions, which were illegal under international law, resulted in vast losses in human life and caused regional instability which, of course, had knock-on effects on global stability. However, from 1991 onwards, the rate at which the US has intervened in the domestic affairs of countries has increased exponentially, breaking international law like never before and acting in a brazen way like never before. The end result of those interventions has been to make the world more dangerous and more unstable than at any time since the Second World War.

The list of countries and regions which the US has intervened in is long and shocking, making for depressing reading: Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria and Ukraine. All of those countries are of immense geo-strategic importance, hence they were, and continue to be, on Washington's radar. And in most of those cases, the Americans have either achieved, or attempted to achieve, their objectives by supporting Islamists (Bosnia, Libya and Syria), Fascists (Croatia and Ukraine) or organized crime (Kosovo).
That interference, which the West has carried out under the deceptive heading “humanitarian intervention,” has caused immense damage to the standing of international law and the mechanisms of the United Nations. It has turned hitherto stable countries and regions into deeply unstable places which have, literally speaking, gone up in flames. It has brought organized crime to towns and cities across Europe. And it has turned Islamist terrorism into a potent force which has spread like a malignant cancer to Europe.
So what accounts for the sudden and drastic increase in America's interventions in the world since 1991? The answer is simple: the absence of the USSR.
The Soviet Union was a superpower which, from 1945 until its collapse in 1991, prevented the US from dominating the world (something that Washington achieved after the Soviet collapse, the consequences of which the world is suffering from today). With a vast industrial sector, a vast industrial-military complex and a vast military, which numbered over four million personnel in 1991, supported by a massive inventory of military equipment, the USSR acted as a formidable bloc to American ambitions.
Look back on failed coup that ended the Soviet Union 25 yrs ago (PART 1) https://t.co/NMrKLSo89rpic.twitter.com/66lRDiPfqm — RT (@RT_com) August 19, 2016
When policymakers in Washington were plotting over which countries to intervene in to enhance American power, they always had to take into consideration what the response of the Soviet government would be. That is not to say, however, that the Americans were always deterred by the Soviet Union, as they were not. But US plans were severely curtailed because of Soviet power. What the world was witness to from 1945-1991 was a counter to American political, economic and military influence. That meant the US did not have a free hand in global affairs.
Now, while the world prior to 1991 was not safe, given that there were more nuclear weapons then than there are today, the number of countries being destabilized were far fewer prior to the Soviet collapse. Further to that, the rise of radical Islam and Islamist terrorism since 1991, which the Americans have played an instrumental role in as a result of their support for Islamists in Bosnia, Libya and Syria, poses a terrible danger today to the safety and security of ordinary people across the world on a daily basis.
Let us take a look at how the world would have developed had the USSR not collapsed.
Communists ask Putin to deploy missiles to Cuba in reply to Pentagon's Turkey expansion https://t.co/tbPIcamIaE — RT (@RT_com) April 27, 2016
First, the Cuban Missile Crisis was averted, in part, because the US had to negotiate with the Soviet Union. People in the West are not often told that one of the main reasons the USSR deployed ICBMs in Cuba was that the US already had its own ICBMs in Turkey, which, of course, shared a border with the Soviet Union. And people in the West are not often told that the Cuban crisis was resolved because the Soviet government agreed to withdraw its ICBMs from the Caribbean island in reciprocation for the Americans withdrawing their ICBMs from Turkey. Hence, out of a near catastrophe for the world emerged a more stable situation, in which neither the US, nor the USSR, had ICBMs on one another's borders. It should be noted, however, that today there are US nuclear warheads in Turkey. Alas, the collapse of the USSR encouraged the Americans once again to deploy weapons of mass destruction in a country situated in a very volatile part of the world, and the Russian Federation did not act as deterrence in that case.

Second, the Soviet Union would not have tolerated Yugoslavia's territorial integrity being torn to shreds as the West did from 1991-1992, and then again in 1999. The Soviet Government would have given its full support to the Yugoslav People's Army to disarm and arrest the illegally armed groups which emerged in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo. And the Soviet Navy would have dispatched a flotilla to Yugoslav waters to deter Western military intervention. It should be remembered that, following the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, Yugoslavia began to turn to the USSR for support.
Third, the Soviet Union deployed its military forces in Afghanistan to neutralize increasing radical Islam there. Partly as a result of the Soviet collapse, the Taliban, under the direction of close US ally Pakistan, soon came to power in Afghanistan. Had the USSR not collapsed, it is possible that the Taliban would not have taken control of the country, and it is certain that the Americans would not have invaded Afghanistan, as they did in 2001. Under no circumstances would the Soviet government have tolerated an American presence in Afghanistan on the borders of Soviet Central Asia – and Washington would have known this. Hence, the terribly dangerous situation in Afghanistan today caused by the American invasion would have been averted through the Soviet deterrent.
Fourth, Iraq, while also an ally of the West, was also an important ally to the USSR. And like the West, the Soviet Government sold vast amounts of military equipment to the Iraqis. During the Iran-Iraq War, Soviet battleships and freighters were sent to the Persian Gulf to ensure non-interrupted supplies of Iraqi oil. The Americans would never have invaded Iraq, like they did in 2003, with the Soviet Union in existence. Washington would have known that an invasion of Iraq could have brought the US and the USSR to the point of war.
25 years on: The failed coup that ended the Soviet Union (PART 2)https://t.co/e7Md994JH0pic.twitter.com/axrfvSKiL9 — RT (@RT_com) August 20, 2016
Fifth, Libya was an important arms market for the USSR and gave Moscow considerable leverage in North Africa. It follows, therefore, that the Soviet Government would have dispatched a naval flotilla to the Libyan coast if the Americans, British and French had considered military intervention to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi, like they did in 2011. Plans for Western intervention in Libya would have been deterred.
Sixth, Syria was the Soviet Union's closest friend and ally in the Middle East and acted as the Soviet government's eyes and ears in this hugely important part of the world. The Americans would never have considered supporting terrorist groups in Syria, as they are doing today. Washington knew just how close relations between Syria and the USSR were. The US would not have touched Syria, just as the USSR would not have touched Israel, a staunch friend and ally of America.
Seventh, Ukraine would not be edging towards membership in the European Union and NATO due to US influence today, because had the USSR not collapsed, the artificially created country of Ukraine would not exist.

It is all too easy to forget that, prior to 1991, American interventions in the world were not as common as they have become today. The Americans, at that point in time, understood that there were limitations on their ambitions and power – and this took the form of the Soviet Union. The US could not simply bomb a country (Serbia) and then take a piece of its territory and proclaim it as “independent” (Kosovo), or invade a country in one of the most geo-strategically important regions of the world (Iraq), depose both its leader and government and replace it with a pro-American one.
If one looks at the countries and regions in the world which are jeopardizing global peace and stability today, one will see that they have all become destabilized by American interventions – from the former Yugoslavia to Iraq to Libya to Syria to Ukraine. And the US succeeded in intervening in those countries because there was no deterrent – no Soviet Union.
Now, Russia, under the leadership of Vladimir Putin, has regained a lot of its lost superpower status. And that is very good for peace and very good for stability in the world. So, for instance, if Russia today was weak, like it was in the 1990s, the Americans would more than likely have opted for direct military force in Syria to topple President Bashar al-Assad. Hence, it is evident that the US does not have the free hand in global affairs which it enjoyed after the Soviet collapse – and this is due to a Russian deterrent.
However, the current Russia does not have the power that the USSR possessed. Perhaps, and hopefully, it will one day. But until then, American interventions will remain a feature of the world in which we live today, albeit reduced in their frequency.
The Soviet Union, which the vast majority of its citizens expressed support for in a March 1991 referendum, proved to be not just a success for its people, but also for global peace and stability as well. This year marks 25 years since that positive force on the international stage disappeared. Suffice it to say that the world today is a more dangerous place because of the absence of the USSR.

Older Australians reject calls to include family home in pension test
Posted
Groups representing older Australians are up in arms over a proposal to put an asset test on the family home, arguing it is unfair.
Key points: The ACCI proposes including family home in assets test
Groups representing older Australians say it is "massively unfair"
The Grattan Institute says including the family home in the pension assets test would be fairer for all Australians
The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) this morning said the family home should be included in the assets test for the aged pension.
But Paul Versteege from the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association said the proposal was "massively unfair".
"We're not quite sure why basically the most vulnerable Australians should be responsible for budget repair," they said.
"There are many other things that could be used to fix the budget.
"Basically people have worked all their lives to own their own home and to ask them at the point where they cease to work to basically start eating into their home equity is terribly unfair."
Mr Versteege said the overwhelming majority of aged pensioners were not investors and the value of their home was not their fault.
"They haven't driven up the price of housing, they have simply bought a house to live in," they said.
"And now because there is a budget problem all of a sudden they're asked to basically hock their house to pay for groceries."
Ian Yates, from the peak body for older Australians, COTA Australia, said the proposal was not as simple as it sounds.
"What you do with the value of the home in terms of the age pension, for example, will affect things like capacity to pay for aged care later in life when frequently the home is used to buy into residential aged care," they said.
"When you actually look at the households who have high asset value in their home and get the age pension, the savings are not as large as people would think they are because many high values, high wealth households are not eligible for the age pension."
Including family home fairer to all
The ACCI released its pre-budget submission today, urging the Federal Government to implement spending cuts that would cause "short-term pain" for long-term budget sustainability.
The submission said retirees with assets, including the primary residence above the threshold, should instead be given interest-free pension loans against the value of the assets.
Brendan Coates from the Grattan Institute agreed that including the family home in the pension assets test would be fairer for all Australians.
"Ten years ago the average household aged over 65 got net transfers from government — that's cash benefits plus the value of government services, less income and GST and other taxes paid — of about just over $20,000 a year, and that jumped up to more than $30,000 a year in 2019, which is the last day that we have available," they said.
"And that's really because there's been increases in pensions, increases in superannuation tax breaks that mean seniors are paying less tax than they used to, and other increases in services, particularly on health and aged care, and that's had a really big impact on the budget position.
"The reality is that older Australians weren't paying enough in tax when they were younger to then cover the value of the entitlements they're now drawing from the budget, particularly when you add in the demographic pressures.
"There are just simply older Australians, more Baby Boomers, the generation, than there were previously."

A vaccination against multiple sclerosis is in progress in the laboratory of SangKon Oh, PhD, at the Baylor Institute for Immunology Research. Along with Gerard Zurawski, PhD, and Ted Phillips, MD, Dr. Oh is applying new insights from research in dendritic cell vaccines to a multiple sclerosis vaccine.
“Dr. Oh's approach is a very unique effort that would harness one's own immune system to suppress multiple sclerosis in an auto antigen-specific manner without disrupting other aspects of normal immunity,” stated Dr. Phillips in a news release provided by Baylor Scott & White Health. The team's studies are unique in that they do not adversely affect the immune system like traditional multiple sclerosis treatment does. Instead, the immune system is preserved.
According to a video from Baylor Health Care System, dendritic cell vaccines are engineered by growing a patient's blood-derived stem cells in vitro to become dendritic cells. These differentiated dendritic cells are then sensitized with immunogenic proteins. After, the dendritic cells are injected into the patient and, similar to a vaccine, prime lymphocytes to attack the immunogenic proteins within the body.
.
Current work was motivated by the application of dendritic cells to fighting cancer, but a unique property of the cells was discovered that allows their influence on immune function. “We discovered that DC-ASGPR, one of the receptors expressed on human dendritic cells, has novel functions to promote antigen-specific regulatory T-cells that can efficiently suppress inflammatory responses,” said Dr. Oh. “This prompted us to test our discovery in autoimmune diseases where antigens are known.”
[adrotate group=”4″]
From that time, the application of dendritic cell vaccines has grown extraordinarily. A phase 1 clinical trial may be in the works as soon as the year 2017. “We need new treatments that, while highly efficacious, also minimally adversely impact the individual's immune system,” said Dr. Phillips.
The findings from this research can be further applied to other diseases such as type 1 diabetes. For now, Dr. Oh is focused on their radical new approach to attack multiple sclerosis in its early stages before the immune system suffers damage.

Chicago Blackhawks prospect Kevin Hayes and general manager Stan Bowman are expected to continue contract negotiations after the NHL draft and around the beginning of free agency, according to Hayes' agent.
Hayes was selected by the Blackhawks as the No. 24 overall pick of the 2010 draft and spent the last four years playing at Boston College. They became eligible to sign with the Blackhawks after their senior season ended in April.
“The last discussion we had, we were just going to wait until the draft, maybe the beginning of free agency, let everything sort out and see where everything is,” Hayes' agent Robert Murray of Pro-Athletes Management said in a phone interview on Wednesday. “We're just looking at the whole situation and figuring out what's best for Kevin.
“We're very comfortable in our position. There's no rush at all.”
The NHL draft will be held on Friday and Saturday and free agency begins on July 1. The Blackhawks own Hayes' rights until Aug. 15. If they don't sign with the Blackhawks, they become an unrestricted free agent, and the Blackhawks would be given a compensatory pick, which would be the 24th pick in the second round of the 2015 draft.
Bowman said on June 3 they were still optimistic the Blackhawks could sign Hayes.
“We said since the day they finished school we've been talking to them all year and all four years of college,” Bowman said on June 3. “We want to sign him. I think they just wanted to take their time and decide what's best for him. [We're] very hopeful that they want to be part of our group.
“I think when they see the way that we play, their skill set is very comparable to the players that have had success here. I think it's a great fit for Kevin. He's 22 years old, so he's not in that 19-year-old category. They may not be a guy who has to spend a long time developing. So that's the benefit of leaving a player in college for four years. He's got a lot of talent.”
The Blackhawks could trade Hayes' rights, but Murray said that wasn't something Hayes was asking to happen.
“That would be up to them,” Murray said. “That has not been discussed.”
ESPN NHL Draft and Prospects analyst Corey Pronman ranks Hayes behind forwards Teuvo Teravainen and Ryan Hartman, and right with defenseman Adam Clendening and forwards Phillip Danault and Mark McNeill among the Blackhawks' top prospects.
"[Hayes] could be a second-line winger as an unusually skilled player for their size possibly, but will need AHL seasoning as needs to rounds out game and improve their consistency,” Pronman said recently.

If you've hit B.C.'s largest shopping mall sometime over the past few months, you've likely spotted Urban Decay's massive “coming soon” façade on the second level.
Now, the California-based cosmetic giant has announced that September 10 is the official opening date for its first Canadian freestanding store at Metropolis at Metrotown. (Just in time for the release of the company's fifth—yes, fifth—Naked palette!)
The 632-square-foot space will carry Urban Decay's full line of cosmetics, plus exclusive “boutique lifestyle” products. An over-the-top “inspiration wall”, four makeover stations, and a digital screen designed to broadcast photos snapped using an in-store mirror will offer makeup junkies the most 21st-century shopping experience imaginable.
Decked out in the brand's signature purple hue, the shop will feature large-scale fixtures such as a 100-inch custom nickel chandelier and a gigantic chrome statue modeled after Urban Decay founder Wende Zomnir's black Lab, Marley. Consider it a nod to the company's cruelty-free ways.
Urban Decay opens at Metropolis at Metrotown (4700 Kingsway, Burnaby) on September 10.
When we posted a gallery of comics covers art drawn from Tony Isabella's 1000 Comic Books You Must Read , some Wired.com readers got pretty riled up about excluded titles.
It was just supposed to be a sampling, people: We obviously couldn't include all 1,000 of the titles in Isabella's cool book. Nevertheless, readers' comics picks proved pretty fascinating.
Ranking the fan blowback by writer, Sandman creator Neil Gaiman topped the readers' choice list. Alan Moore was widely lauded for Watchmen as well as Swamp Thing and From Hell . Frank Miller and Grant Morrison rounded out the top four for a variety of their bold franchise reinventions.
A few commenters went epic-length. FlipM cited 24 titles “off the top of my head” that deserved must-read status. Others went deep with major love for a specific issue, like reader pjbeisser, who promised that Walking Dead No. 48 “will make you both sick to your stomach — and potentially cry like a little girl.”
For a close-up of fan favorites including Wanted , pictured above, check out comments and graphics in the comic book cover art gallery that follows.

Animal Man No. 5
The series took a minor DC character with the cheesy power of gaining the abilities of any nearby animal, and turned it into a clever, esoteric spin on superhero comics. Issue 5 features a Wile E. Coyote-type character breaking the fourth wall to escape an endless cycle of violence. Animal Man No. 26 is also excellent, as they learn about their fictional nature and confronts their author. –hokum
I would go for the 24 issues of Animal Man written by Grant Morrison. The mix of meta-linguistic, reality-warping, suburban superhero fantasy made more for me than four years studying psychology. –Lisandro
The Bone
I would be very disappointed if Bone by Jeff Smith isn't somehow mentioned in the book. The series lasted 55 issues over the course of 10 years or so. Delightfully funny fantasy adventure. –avenger534
Y: The Last Man
I loved Y: The Last Man . A world without men is very thought-provoking, and I think Brian K. Vaughan did a good job imagining what it might be like. –Zometh
The Red Star
The Red Star , created by Christian Gossett, has to be on my top five list of all time…. In addition to being a phenomenal comic, [it] is also trying to drop the European comics model into the American scene and, unfortunately, suffering for it. Where the American market expects monthly deliveries of generally OK products, the European model supports more lengthy creations that often deserve the title of graphic novel. This is also a more humane model for the artists, who get to realize a complete vision from start to end, as well as for the readers, who are able to buy a complete story when it's published in a single unit, instead of parsed out in pamphlets. –pyar
Walking Dead No. 48
I have personally enjoyed Robert Kirkman and Charlie Adlard's Walking Dead . Also Kirkman and Ryan Ottley's Invincible is one of my favorites right now. –joshriddell
Looking for a particular issue that will make you both sick to your stomach — and potentially cry like a little girl? First thing that comes to mind is probably, “No.” After reading comics for 20 years, I thought I had … read it all, seen it all, done it all. Then came Walking Dead #48 (2008)…. For those unfamiliar, it's a black-and-white monthly book about a group of survivors who are struggling to make it day to day after a majority of the populace become zombies…. Intense! I finally got to meet Robert Kirkman earlier this year at the Baltimore Comic Con. Everyone in front of me had a stack of books for them to sign. This is the only one I had in hand. –pjbeisser
The Eternals and Jack Kirby
Get some Jack Kirby artwork under your eyes. In particular, notice their particular use of shadow, which might be termed “Kirbyoscuro,” and often looks not unlike biomorphic circuitry. I got to read a lot of their '70s series. An outstanding series was their one for Marvel: The Eternals , about what happens when giant, ancient gods return to Earth. –Osirisrise
The Preacher
Preacher combines Clint Eastwoood's Unforgiven with David Lynch's Twin Peaks . Great stuff. –featuring_dave
Invincible
I feel comics are having a renaissance. Here are some titles I recommend to the old-school comic geek and the new readers alike:
Invincible , Image Comics, Robert Kirkman
Y: The Last Man , Vertigo (DC), Brian K. Vaughn
Powers , Image Comics, Brian Michael Bendis
The Walking Dead , Image Comics, Robert Kirkman
Hawaiian Dick , Image Comics, B. Clay Moore
Fables , Vertigo (DC), Bill Willingham –csmallfield
Hellboy
After my comic-book-collecting high-school years, Hellboy was the only thing that kept me reading comics! –monkut
Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth
Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth by Grant Morrison. So sick. –sammyvicious
Sandman
Neil Gaiman's Sandman is a masterpiece of this or any other medium. –MrJM
My suggestion: The Sound of Them Wings by Neil Gaiman, Sandman No. 8. –ianderthal
Sandman . Nuff said. –noodlelpugerine
Neil Gaiman's Sandman … especially Brief Lives . –kaylan
Definitely need to read the entirety of Neil Gaiman's Sandman series. –fencerf
The Morningstar Option, Parts 1-3 . It's a spinoff of Sandman without Gaiman writing but it's fantastically written for the character. –Lucifer 00
Fables
Vertigo's Fables , can't believe that nobody has mentioned them yet. Twelve Eisners and counting. Also Hellboy , Sandman and Transmetropolitan are all required reading before you visit the casket. –kloudykat
Miracleman
I'd add a vote for Miracleman — though not sure which issues I'd include. Still amazed at how they took a character that was about as dorky as it gets (basically Captain Marvel/Shazam) and rework it into something really dark and chilling and intense. –ronb

Transmetropolitan
I feel like everyone should read Transmetropolitan by Warren Ellis. A lot of the subject matter is amazingly funny, but there's one cryogenics story that is pretty hard-hittingly sad. –Sliver
Transmetropolitan was fun, and I haven't read Maus yet but want to someday. I quick-read Marvels at the comic shop earlier this year and it was excellent as well. –baccaruda
From Hell by Alan Moore and Transmetropolitan by Warren Ellis were both excellent reads. –kwikdraw
Batman: The Dark Knight Returns
Sorry, but this list is too constrained for my tastes…. The most influential comic in the history of the genre, The Dark Knight Returns , wasn't even mentioned, except in a post by another reader! There's a complete world of very cool stuff out there that just went — zip! — right over this guy's head. So here's my list: Any issue of Heavy Metal with stories/art by Enki Bilal or Jean Giraud/Moebius; Shirow's Appleseed and Ghost in the Shell ; Adam Warren's Dirty Pair (if you have time for only one, go with Sim Hell ); Frank Miller's Return of the Dark Knight . I close with my fave line from Warren: “Girls with guns! Crucial realm!” –rpbird
Green Lantern
Gonna have to go with the Adams/O'Neil run on Green Lantern/Green Arrow . Beautiful art and some hard-hitting tales make these classic books. Also worthy of seeking out is the Grant Morrison/Steve Yeowell series Zenith , taken from U.K. publication 2000 AD . Light-years ahead of its time. –jeemie
One of the best has to be Green Lantern/Green Arrow Nos. 85 and 86 with Speedy's drug addiction. –Magician216
One of my all-time favorites is Green Lantern: Emerald Dawn . It's one of the first comics I read and still one of the best. Also, Kurt Busiek's Marvels is amazing. –gpmeyer2
Valiant Comics
I loved the Valiant Comics with first 12 issues of Magnus, Robot Fighter , Rai , X-O , Dr. Solar , Turok , Archer & Armstrong , Harbinger and Eternal Warrior . Anything before Unity 2 . –halkyra
Watchmen
What about the Watchmen ? Rorschach's character alone represents the living embodiment of paranoia. –mrnonel
Watchmen by Alan Moore, no doubt. –LupinYonsei
It may be a graphic novel but it has changed the world of literature and everyone needs to read it. –JordanEast
1) Alan Moore's Watchmen — one of Time magazine's top 100 novels of the 20th century
2) The Long Halloween
3) A Dame to Kill For — the best in Frank Miller's Sin City series
4) Batman: Year One
5) For all you zombie fans: The Walking Dead series. –iamhouli
I've gotta say that Alan Moore's Watchmen is a must-read. Definitely one of the greatest graphic novels of all time. –navoghosh

Lawyers for Salinger, 90, have filed a lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan, seeking to force a recall of what it says is a copycat book titled 60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye, by someone writing under the name JD California. It also seeks unspecified damages.
The lawsuit said the right to create a sequel to The Catcher in the Rye or to use the character "Holden Caulfield" belongs only to Salinger. The lawsuit says Salinger has "decidedly chosen not to exercise that right."
Besides California, identified in the court papers as "John Doe," the lawsuit also cites Windupbird Publishing, an obscure company allegedly based in London; a Swedish publisher, Nicotext; and SCB Distributors, based in Gardena, California.
In 60 Years Later, scheduled to be published in Britain this summer and in the United States in the autumn, a character very much like Caulfield is 76 years old, an escapee from a retirement home and identified as "Mr. C." The novel is dedicated to Salinger and the author is a character in it, too, wondering whether to continue Caulfield's story.
"The Sequel is not a parody and it does not comment upon or criticise the original," Salinger's lawsuit claims. "It is a ripoff pure and simple."
The lawsuit presented California as a mysterious, unsavoury character, of uncertain name and location. "His precise whereabouts are unknown, despite due investigation," according to the court papers.
Aaron Silverman, the director of SCB Distributors, said that California was a resident of Sweden. A man identifying themselves as California said that they lived outside of Goteborg, Sweden. They called the legal action "a little bit insane" and said that Salinger had control over the names of their characters, but not over their style or perspective.
"To me, this is a story about an old man. It's a love story, a story about an author and their character," said California, who added that John David California was their pen name. They declined to give their real name and said that they did not intend "John David" as an homage to Salinger, whose full name is Jerome David Salinger.
"I did not mean to cause them any trouble," California said.
A recluse living in rural New Hampshire, Salinger has not published in a book in decades and has rarely been heard from in public - expect when taking legal action.
In 1982, they sued a man who allegedly tried to sell a fictitious interview with the author to a national magazine. The impostor agreed to desist and Salinger dropped the suit.
Achieving custom ablation
First, wavefront sensing devices or aberrometers measure the wavefront distortions created by all the structures in the eye. [5] The complete optical aberration of the eye is the cumulative sum of the aberrations created by all the eye structures. It is not known which structures give rise to which aberration component, but the total aberration of the eye is measured.
Mathematically, the aberrated wavefront can be described by Zernike polynomials. The weighted-sum of a number of polynomials may be used to reconstruct the aberrated wavefront. The higher the number of polynomials used, the better it approximates the actual wavefront. Second, the information generated by the wavefront analyzer is used to guide excimer laser treatment to counteract the eye's aberrations. Third, the excimer laser uses a small spot scanning beam to precisely place the custom ablation profile onto the cornea. This laser should have a fast eye tracker to null all eye movements. Without a fast eye tracker, saccadic eye movements may degrade the effect of the precise laser ablation profile.
Adaptive optics
Wavefront technology and adaptive optics were first used by astronomers in designing land-based telescopes to reduce unwanted wavefront distortions. Stars twinkle because when starlight passes through the earth's atmosphere, the light rays are bent by air of different temperatures and densities (turbulence). Without adaptive optics, the randomly distorted starlight entering a telescope will be magnified and will appear as scintillating blobs.
In the Gemini telescope, a separate column of starlight is funneled into a wavefront sensor. The wavefront sensor separates this column of light and samples each zone to calculate how the atmosphere distorts the light rays. The information from the wavefront sensor is fed back to a deformable mirror capable of changing shape hundreds of times per second to counteract the distortions caused by the atmosphere. In other words, the distorted light rays from the distant stars can be undistorted by combining wavefront analysis and adaptive optics.
Three types of wavefront analyzers or aberrometers
Aberrometers measure optical aberrations by different methods. Ray-tracing devices and Tscherning aberrometers measure aberrations as light enters the eye. Hartmann-Shack wavefront analyzers measure aberrations as light exits the eye.
The Dresden Wavefront Analyzer uses the Tscherning aberrometer's method to calculate optical aberration. A frequency-doubled Nd:YAG emits laser through a mask to create 128 parallel light rays onto the retina. If the eye was a perfect optical system, these rays would appear as an array of perfectly spaced dots on the retina. In an imperfect biological optical system, aberration would cause these rays to appear as deformed dots and an irregular array on the retina. A charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, via indirect ophthalmoscopy, captures the image of dots on the retina. Then, the aberrated wavefront is reconstructed by using Zernike polynomials.
Theo Seiler, MD, used the Dresden Wavefront Analyzer to measure the precise aberrations in the eye, and then performed custom ablation with the Wavelight Allegretto laser. In the 2000 America Academy of Ophthalmology meeting, they presented data comparing custom ablation results with standard LASIK results. The follow-up period was 3 months. Of custom ablation patients, 15% achieved the best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) of 20/10 compared to 5% with standard ablation. In the custom ablation group, 45% were between 20/16 and 20/12 compared to 30% of those who received standard ablation. In the custom ablation group, 30% were 20/20 compared to 50% in the standard ablation group.
At this stage, Seiler emphasized that the main use of custom ablation is to repair previous irregular ablations, and the potential of achieving super vision is yet to be realized. In an article published by Mrochen in 2001, 3 months follow-up data were shown after wavefront guided LASIK using the Allegretto laser on 35 eyes. [6] Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of 20/20 or better was achieved in 93.5% of eyes, and BSCVA of 20/10 or better was achieved in 16.0% of eyes.
Ray tracing aberrometer (Tracey) is similar to the Tscherning aberrometer because it measures aberration when light enters the eye. Instead of light beams entering simultaneously, they enter sequentially into the eye. After each light ray reaches the retina, the photodetector records and computes its aberration. The advantage of this method over other aberrometers is that in the presence of a highly aberrated eye, criss-cross of light rays is avoided, ie, different light rays, when fired sequentially rather than simultaneously, are less likely to be confused by the photodetectors.
One of the goals of custom ablation is to repair eyes that underwent suboptimal older generation refractive procedures that increased the eyes' optical aberrations. High aberration eyes may cause confusion when the Tscherning and the Hartmann-Shack aberrometers are used, but, theoretically, the Tracey aberrometer will be able to measure large aberrations. Another advantage of the Tracey aberrometer is that it functions at higher speeds than other systems; therefore, it is not affected by saccadic eye movement. The prototype delivers 320 light rays in 20 milliseconds over a 6-mm zone.
In the Hartmann-Shack Wavefront analyzer, an eye-safe laser beam enters the eye. If the eye is emmetropic, the light that scatters back from the retina exits the eye as parallel rays. Aberrations in the eye cause deviations in the exiting light rays, which are measured by a wavefront sensor. The Autonomous (Summit Technology, Inc, Waltham, Mass), VISX (Santa Clara, Calif), and Bausch & Lomb Surgical (Munich, Germany) analyzers rely on a Hartmann-Shack Wavefront analyzer.
Autonomous, in partnership with Zeiss Humphrey Systems, developed the CustomCornea Accessory Device. The eye is aligned with a fixation target, an eye-safe probe laser, a video camera, and a wavefront sensor. The probe laser emits an eye-safe laser into the eye, and, after the light is reflected back, a wavefront sensor measures the directions of the distorted light rays.
At the 2000 International Society of Refractive Surgery meeting, Marguerite McDonald, MD, reported data on 23 bilateral LASIK and 13 bilateral PRK surgeries. One eye of each patient was selected randomly for CustomCornea treatment, while the other received conventional LADARVision ablation profile.
In the myopic subgroup that received LASIK, at 6 months postoperatively, 85% of the eyes treated with custom ablation achieved an uncorrected vision of 20/25 or better, and 92% treated with conventional ablation profile achieved an uncorrected vision of 20/25 or better. In the hyperopic subgroup, 80% of the eyes treated with custom ablation achieved an uncorrected vision of 20/40 or better, and 90% treated with conventional ablation profile achieved an uncorrected vision of 20/40 or better. This suggested that custom ablation created less perfect results compared to conventional LASIK.
In the myopic subgroup that received PRK, at 6 months postoperatively, 85% of the eyes treated with custom ablation achieved an uncorrected vision of 20/20 or better, and 65% treated with conventional ablation profile achieved an uncorrected vision of 20/20 or better. Higher order aberrations decreased by 46% using customized PRK and decreased by only 26% using customized LASIK.
VISX introduced the WaveScan Wavefront Analysis System in 2000, which uses the Hartmann-Shack analyzer principle. The sensor consists of adaptive optics mounted on microchips to create a matrix of lenslets (micromirrors) that refract thousands of light rays. The analyzer focuses the light rays onto a CCD chip and reconstructs the wavefront entering the lenslet array and calculates the aberrations using Zernike polynomials. The process of wavefront analysis and data presentation for each patient's eye is termed waveprint, as it depicts the "fingerprint" of the eye.
VISX went one step ahead to use the wavefront data to ablate a plastic lens called the PreVue lens, so that the patient can wear this lens on a trail frame to mimic the effect of what they will see after receiving custom ablation. If patients were able to see better than 20/16 with the PreVue lens, then they were candidates to be included in the VISX custom ablation trial. In the 2001 ASCRS meeting, Kraft reported data from 17 eyes that were treated with custom ablation. Preoperative BSCVA of 20/12.5 was 6%, 20/16 was 59%, and 20/20 was 100%. Postoperative UCVA of 20/12.5 was 29%, 20/16 was 94%, and 20/20 was 100%. These results seem to indicate that custom ablation increased the likelihood of super vision, but the same pattern of results were obtained when patients were treated with the conventional ablation pattern using the VISX S3 laser with 6.5-mm treatment zone and a blend zone.
The Zywave aberrometer (Bausch & Lomb Surgical, Munich, Germany) uses the principle of a Hartmann-Shack sensor. The Zyoptics system links the data from the Zywave system that performed wavefront analysis with the Orbscan IIz, which provided anatomical customization to the Technolas 217Z laser.
At the American Academy of Ophthalmology Refractive Surgery Interest Group meeting (October 2000), Michael Knorz, MD, reported prospective data on 32 patients in whom one eye received the regular LASIK treatment, and the other eye received Zyoptix custom ablation treatment. [7] Out of the 32 patients, 21 patients experienced an increase in best-corrected visual acuity, 7 patients showed no difference, and 4 patients had worse outcome than the Planoscan software. These represent early data when nomograms have not been perfected yet because best-corrected visual acuity data were presented rather than uncorrected visual acuity data.
In the Zyoptics study performed at TLC Windsor, Probst reported that in 100 eyes with 3-months follow-up, postoperative UCVA of 20/15 or better was 45.0%, 20/20 or better was 89.0%, and 20/40 or better was 99.8%. These compared favorably with those completed with conventional ablation, which showed postoperative UCVA of 20/15 or better was 29.0%, 20/20 or better was 84.0%, and 20/40 or better was 99.5%.
Sony is simply not having a good time lately. The company is fighting hackers by obtaining restraining orders, it's trying to get tools to hack the PlayStation 3 taken offline, and the latest PS3 firmware has quite a glitch: it makes hard drive upgrades impossible on many PS3 models.
The problem seems due to the rushed nature of Sony's latest security update. A post on NeoGaf explains the situation:
The 3.56 patch is a tiny patch which simply add/changes files in the 3.55 software. This differs from most patches which download the entire firmware. Since part of the software on models with 16MB of flash memory is stored on the hard drive, those PS3's need to reinstall the software when upgrading the drive. PS3's with 256MB of flash memory store all the software in the flash memory so it isn't lost on a drive upgrade. Anyway since 3.56 is a hot patch and requires 3.55 to be installed prior to updating, you can't install 3.56 on a new drive. You also could install 3.55 when upgrading if not for Sony's software version checks.
Don't worry, Sony isn't removing the ability to upgrade your hard drive. This issue popped up in a previous firmware update and was fixed, which means we can expect more patches in the near future. One poor gamer ran into this glitch the hard way when they tried to format their hardware and start with a fresh PlayStation 3... only to find their system more or less broken without a way to install a working hard drive.
If you're not planning to upgrade your hard drive, this isn't much of a problem, and it should be fixed soon. If you were planning to upgrade, just sit tight until Sony fixes the issue. The worst thing you could do at this point is reformat your hard drive, as there is no way to successfully restore it if you're running the latest firmware.
Update: It looks as if Sony silently pushed out a new version of the 3.56 firmware that requires you to manually update the system. There are no notes on what this new version does, and the version number remains the same, but the problem may have been fixed.
It's well established that quarterback is the most important position in football, and that's becoming even more apparent as teams continue to install offenses which are so heavily dependent upon the pass. That's why Heisman Trophy voters are so hesitant to hand over the award to someone who plays another position and are justified in doing so.
Over the past few seasons, we've had some incredible quarterbacks pass through the college ranks, from Johnny Manziel to Jameis Winston to Marcus Mariota. But even as those players move on to the next level, the overall depth of the position on a national scale only continues to grow, and that trend doesn't seem likely to change in 2015.
We recently released our ranking of the Top 247 players in college football for the upcoming season and 22 quarterbacks made the list.
As with any ranking involving more than one person, we all had differing opinions on where the respective players should be ranked. Here's my personal ranking of top five signal-callers in the country for the 2015 season.
5. Jared Goff | Jr. | 6-4 | 215 | California
High School (2013): Greenbrae (Calif.) Marin Catholic
247Sports Composite: Four-Star (0.9127), No. 15 Pro-Style QB
Summary: Jared Goff hasn't gotten much recognition for their stellar play last season, and Cal's 5-7 record is largely to blame for that. But thanks to Goff, the Bears were able to give several good teams – UCLA, USC and Arizona among them – a run for their money, despite fielding a defense that ranked among the nation's worst. In 12 games last year as a true sophomore, Goff was 316-of-509 passing (62.1 percent) for 3,973 yards with 35 touchdowns and just 7 interceptions to their credit. Perhaps the nation's best pure passer, Goff possesses a very good arm with even better accuracy and, while not a major running threat, is mobile enough to maneuver around the pocket to buy time as they go through their progressions. With a strong junior campaign and continued improvement, it's a very real possibility that Goff could be the first quarterback off the board come next year's NFL Draft.
4. J.T. Barrett | RS-Soph. | 6-2 | 225 | Ohio State
High School (2013): Wichita Falls (Texas) Rider
247Sports Composite: Four-Star (0.9348), No. 3 Dual-Threat QB
Summary: Ohio State's end-of-season run with Cardale Jones at the helm has made some forget just how good J.T. Barrett was prior to their season-ending injury. When Braxton Miller went down before the season, many thought the Buckeyes' national title hopes were doomed, only to have Barrett step in and lead the team to an 11-1 record, placing the Buckeyes right in the thick of the playoff race. The redshirt first-year student finished the year with 2,834 passing yards, 938 rushing yards, and a Big Ten record 45 total touchdowns (34 passing, 11 rushing), and their 169.8 passing efficiency mark ranked 2nd in the country. As a result of their outstanding season, Barrett was named the Big Ten Quarterback of the Year and finished fifth in Heisman Trophy voting. With an outstanding offensive line, one of the best running backs in the country, and a loaded wide receiver corps at their disposal, the pieces are all in place for Barrett to have another big year. But first, he'll need to beat out Jones to win the starting job.
3. Cody Kessler | Sr. | 6-1 | 215 | USC
High School (2011): Bakersfield (Calif.) Centennial
247Sports Composite: Four-Star (0.9311), No. 4 Pro-Style QB
Summary: Though it seems unfathomable that a USC quarterback could fly under the radar, Cody Kessler somehow managed to do just that last season. Despite posting incredibly efficient numbers, the Trojans' signal-caller didn't factor into the Heisman conversation. They're finishing the year having thrown for 3,826 yards with 39 touchdowns and a mere five interceptions, ranking third nationally in completion percentage (69.7%) and fourth in passing efficiency (167.1). As Kessler enters their senior season, he'll have to find a new favorite target due to the departure of Nelson Agholor, but the Trojans' depth at the skill positions should make for an easy transition. There will be no flying under the radar for Kessler this season, however, as the Trojans are ranked No. 8 in the preseason AP Poll and are expected to contend for the national title.
2. Trevone Boykin | Sr. | 6-2 | 205 | TCU
High School (2011): Mesquite (Texas) West Mesquite
247Sports Composite: Three-Star (0.8491), No. 53 ATH
Summary: TCU experienced an offensive resurgence last season and Trevone Boykin's emergence had a lot to do with that. Boykin thrived in their first season at the helm of offensive coordinator Doug Meacham's spread system, completing 61.2 percent of their passes for 3,901 yards with 33 touchdowns and 10 interceptions, while also picking up 707 yards and 8 scores on the ground. The former wide receiver even added a 55-yard TD reception for good measure. This season, their top three targets are back and so is most of their offensive line, so Boykin's second year in the system should be even better. And with TCU having to replace several key defensive players, Boykin may need to be even better as the Horned Frogs look to make it to the College Football Playoff after being left out a season ago.
1. Deshaun Watson | Soph. | 6-2 | 210 | Clemson
High School (2014): Gainesville (Ga.)
247Sports Composite: Four-Star (0.9791), No. 1 Dual-Threat QB
Summary: Sure, Deshaun Watson has only played in a handful of games at the college level and he's coming off a major knee injury. But what little we have seen from them was really good and all reports indicate he's back to full health. Last year as a true first-year student, Watson completed 67.9 percent of their passes for 1,466 yards with 14 touchdowns and just two picks. They averaged 10.7 yards per attempt while posting a 188.7 passing efficiency rating, both marks that would have led the nation if they had enough pass attempts to qualify. Their finest performance may have come in the regular season finale against South Carolina, when they threw for a pair of scores and rushed for two more to help Clemson snap a 5-game losing streak against its bitter rivals, despite playing with a torn ACL that would require surgery. We've only seen a fraction of what Watson is capable of as a quarterback and they should only continue to get better going forward. If they can stay healthy, look out.
There have been some bumps along the road, somewhat expected over the course of an 82-game season, but the Islanders have done enough to clinch a berth in the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the third time in the past four seasons.
Expectations were high for the New York Islanders last fall. They had won 47 games in 2014-15, were moving into a modern facility and were ready to see some younger players take the next step.
Here are five reasons the Islanders clinched:
1. Home cooking
There was obviously some uncertainty regarding how the Islanders would fare in their first season at Barclays Center after 43 years at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. But from a results standpoint, the move has undoubtedly been a success. With their 5-2 win against the Tampa Bay Lightning on Monday, the Islanders are 25-10-4 in Brooklyn.
2. Goaltending depth
There wasn't much insurance behind No. 1 goalie Jaroslav Halak last season, but general manager Garth Snow shored that up with the signing of Thomas Greiss, who may have exceeded expectations. Greiss was arguably the Islanders' most valuable player during the first half of the season and will likely get the call in Game 1 of the postseason while Halak recovers from a lower-body injury sustained March 8. Greiss has started 36 games and has won 22 of them, both career-highs, to go along with a 2.37 goals-against average and a .924 save percentage.
3. Last hurrahs?
The season is nearly over and two key forwards on the Islanders roster, Frans Nielsen and Kyle Okposo, have not agreed to contracts for 2016-17 and beyond. Nielsen, their best two-way player, was drafted by the Islanders in 2002 and has played more than 600 NHL games, all with New York. Okposo, one of their most consistent forwards this season, was their first-round pick in 2006 and is second on the team with 62 points in 77 games. It's hard to imagine where the Islanders would be without either player this season.
Video: NYI@CAR: Okposo's spinning shot beats Lack
4. Travis Hamonic
Hamonic, perhaps their most reliable defenseman, is lost for the remainder of the regular season and potentially longer after sustaining a lower-body injury in a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets on March 31. But their ability to play at each end of the ice, despite whatever their personal issue is back in their native Winnipeg (he requested a trade prior to the season), led to Hamonic's most impressive season yet; they have 21 points in 72 games and leads the Islanders with an average of 23:49 of ice time per game.
"It's always tough, you know how much they want to be a part of the stretch here and trying to get into the playoffs," captain John Tavares told the Islanders website. "We obviously hope he'll be back soon. Everyone just has to step up and fill the void. It's hard to replace a guy like him, but certainly we have guys that are very capable of playing more minutes and expanding their role."
5. The fourth line
Regarded by many as the best in the League, the trio of Casey Cizikas, Matt Martin and Cal Clutterbuck combine the ability to wreak havoc and contribute offensively.
Clutterbuck has 15 goals, including five game-winners. Cizikas has a career-high 27 points and continues to play a major role on the penalty kill. Martin, who can become an unrestricted free agent this summer, leads the NHL with 362 hits.

Corporations rebut claims by party leader that they are profiting from ‘interest-free loans' from suppliers
Jeremy Corbyn has said a Labour government would “declare war” on corporations that fail to pay suppliers on time, although the companies they singled out, such as M&S, have said they do not recognise their data.
The Labour leader accused large companies, including E.ON, Capita and the BT group, of profiting from the late payments as they vowed to ease regulations on small businesses. But credit check agency Experian said its data should not be seen as a barometer of how fast a company pays its suppliers.
“Cash is king for any business, and big companies are managing their cash by borrowing – interest free – from their suppliers,” the Labour leader told a Federation for Small Business event.
“Some of the biggest names in business are holding cash piles that don't actually belong to them. It's a national scandal. And it's stopping businesses from growing and causing thousands to go bust every year. It kills jobs and holds back economic growth.”
Labour said Corbyn's attack on the corporations was based on analysing data from current Experian credit reports, which identified payment beyond terms, normally 30-60 days, by big companies.
In the figures quoted by Labour, M&S went 72 days beyond terms, Capita 82 days and the National Grid as long as 119 days. Others mentioned by Corbyn were 89 days for BT and 84 days for Vodafone.
Experian said the figures, taken from their report, said the figures only relate to invoices which are settled late and do not take into consideration payments made on time.
“The data relates to how late a business can expect any late payments to be, and not the company's overall track record on the payment of suppliers,” a spokesperson said. “It is intended for indicative purposes only, to inform specific business decisions, and we would not recommend it is used as an overall barometer of how a company pays suppliers.”
Almost all the companies named by Corbyn, including M&S, Capita and BT Group, disputed the figures in the speech. An M&S spokesperson said: “We don't recognise these numbers at all. Over 99% of our supplier invoices are paid on time and we are signatories to the prompt payment code.”
A BT spokesperson said the company spent £9.3bn with UK suppliers last year, 40% of which went to small businesses. “During 2015/16 the average number of days between BT being invoiced and payment to UK suppliers was 54 days, well below the figures claimed in this report, which we do not recognise,” the spokesperson said.
Capita said it did not recognise the figures either and said 90% of invoices were paid within 30 days of receipt. A National Grid spokesperson said the company was a signatory to the prompt payment code and “consistently pay at least 90% of our invoices on time”.
Vodafone said it paid SME suppliers 45 days on average from the invoice date. “We pay 90% of our invoices on time and, where this is not achieved, the most significant factor is receiving the invoices late from the supplier,” a spokesperson said.
Small business minister: late payments are an outrage Read more
The FSB has estimated that prompt payments to suppliers could prevent 50,000 small businesses going under each year.
Any company bidding for public-sector contracts with a future Labour government would have to pay its own suppliers within 30 days, Corbyn said on Tuesday, and Labour would consider creating a binding arbitration system, with fines for persistent late-payers.
The Labour leader pledged not to increase the corporation tax rate for small businesses and to scrap quarterly reporting for businesses with turnover of less than £83,000, calling it “a burden, a distraction, that will hold entrepreneurs back”.
They said large corporations were “privileged” by the government in their tax affairs over ordinary people or small businesses. They joked about their own tax return mishap, where they were fined for a late payment, calling it a “donation” to HMRC.
“No one likes paying tax. We don't wake up in the morning thinking, ‘Oh, I really must pay some more tax today'. But most of us know that taxes are essential to a civilised society and a successful economy,” they said. “So most of us play by the rules. We do our tax returns, as you know, mine seems to attract more attention than most but that's OK, transparency is important.”
Corbyn has been repeatedly criticised by Theresa May for Labour's pledge to borrow £500bn for investments, including in regional investment banks.
The party has struggled to rebuild trust in its economic credibility, with the latest Observer/Opinium poll showing 44% trust May and their chancellor, Philip Hammond, to run the economy, while just 15% say Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, are trustworthy.
Amanda Milling, a Conservative member of the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said Labour's pledge to borrow to invest £500bn would “crash the economy, just like they did last time”.
In remarks on Tuesday that anticipated some of the criticism, Corbyn said: “The prime minister frequently accuses me of wanting to bankrupt Britain by borrowing money to fund investment. But, as every business person knows, there is a world of difference between borrowing for capital spending and borrowing to fund the payroll and day to day trading or service delivery.
“The risk of bankruptcy comes not when you borrow to invest in projects that will deliver growth but when you give tax breaks to big companies and the wealthy when you don't have enough money to run public services.”
As Americans prepare for a wave of hot new mobile devices this fall,
the Un-carrier promises to beat big carriers' best trade-in offers
Bellevue, Washington – September 8, 2014 – In advance of a huge wave of new superphones and tablets coming to market this fall, T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ) today vowed to beat the big carriers' best trade-in values on used devices - to help American wireless consumers get the very best deal on the hottest new devices.
Consumers can now have peace of mind when they're ready to upgrade, knowing that their trade-in at T-Mobile is the best deal they'll find anywhere compared to AT&T, Sprint and Verizon. And, they'll never have to worry about the fine print and all the details the carriers continue to hide behind.
“We're going to see some of the most phenomenal devices ever in the coming months, and that means a whole lot of Americans trading-in their devices and upgrading,” said John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile. “For years, the big carriers have been ripping off their customers with low-ball trade-in values, so we're putting an end to that and guaranteeing we'll give customers what they deserve − the best value in the industry.”
This latest move is just one more example of T-Mobile changing the way consumers buy wireless service and innovating ways to give everyone the best access to the most amazing technologies of our lifetime.
“When that new superphone's price is the same everywhere you go, the difference in your final cost comes down to the trade-in value of your old phone,” said Mike Sievert, chief marketing officer for T-Mobile. “Now when you're ready to upgrade – it's a no brainer where to find the best value– the Un-carrier. Guaranteed.”
To make good on this guarantee, T-Mobile will track the market every day to ensure we keep our promise. If a customer can find a better trade-in offer from a major national carrier, T-Mobile will beat that offer, give them the difference back and because we value this help from our customer we will top it off with another $50!
This offer starts September 17 and is for a limited time. All a customer has to do is call T-Mobile or go online within seven days of completing a trade-in at T-Mobile and tell us where, when and for how much they saw a better deal for their device. It's that easy.
Eligible device trade-in, qualifying credit, and new device purchase with qualifying service required. Difference in trade-in price and $50 offer applied as a bill credit within 2-3 bill cycles. See T-Mobile.com for details.

Yesterday I gave three reasons why Shigeru Miyamoto should be Nintendo's next president, but that doesn't mean he's the only man in the running for the position. In fact, Miyamoto is currently acting as interim president with one other man – Genyo Takeda. Perhaps an even more likely candidate than Miyamoto, Genyo Takeda joined Nintendo all the way back in 1972 and is one of their most senior members of staff. Takeda is currently the general manager of Nintendo's integrated research division, a title they have held since the division was created in 1981. So he's been around for a long time, but why should they be president? Well…
1. He's An Innovator
For as long as Nintendo has been creating innovations in gaming, Takeda has been there. They and their research and development team are credited with creating the first battery back-up memory system to allow for saving in video games, starting with the original Legend of Zelda in 1986. Imagine video games without a saving mechanic nowadays? The battery supplied a lifelong power source for the RAM chip so that data could be maintained even once the power supply from the console was shut down.  They are also credited with the invention of the N64's analog stick, something that has been copied to nearly every console release ever since. The analog stick opened the doors into an era of 3-dimensional console gaming that could never have been possible with anything else. More recently, Takeda was one of the lead developers of the Wii console. They fought hard against the model of increasing graphical fidelity because they claimed that a model focused only on graphics is not an ideal model for the consumer. In an infamous interview with Satoru Iwata himself, Takeda stated “In development, we came to realize the sheer inefficiency of this path when we compared the hardships and costs of development against the new experiences customers might have”. That decision helped propel the Wii to be the best-selling console Nintendo has ever had.
2. They Have Corporate Experience
While Miyamoto has been a designer and director for the majority of their career, Takeda has been dealing with the corporate side of the business for a very long time. As the senior managing director for research and development, Takeda has been reporting to the board and managing the corporate business for a long time. Not only that, but they truly understand the hardware perhaps better than anyone else at Nintendo, having helped develop a majority of it. In that same interview with Iwata, Takeda made an incredibly memorable comparison of the gaming industry to the automotive industry, likening the Wii itself to a Hybrid car with a balance of power and practicality.
When we look at the automobile industry, not every car is following the same evolutionary course. While some are trying to make faster cars, others are gathering public attention around the world with their hybrid engines. If automobiles can be used a metaphor, our industry has always been trying to compete over horsepower, even though not all cars are made to compete in F1 races.
Takeda brings a balance of leadership and experience to a corporate role that virtually nobody else at Nintendo can bring, and that sort of experience could be exactly what the Big N needs in their next president.
3. They Can Propel Nintendo Forward Rather Than Be Stuck In The Past
Let's face it – Nintendo's console market share has had better days. The Wii U hasn't sold nearly as well as the Wii, and there are already rumours of a new console coming from the company as early as 2016. The Wii U is largely heralded as a failure for a variety of reasons, but one of the main being it felt more like a minor upgrade to the Wii rather than a brand-new console. When the Wii was being developed, Takeda was one of the main proponents of giving the console a massive UI overhaul and really turning it into its own system rather than just making it feel like a faster and more powerful Gamecube. They helped launch the system forward while many at Nintendo wanted it to just be a moderate upgrade. As a researcher and developer, Takeda has been pushing for innovation at a company seemingly stuck in the 1990s for their entire career. And that's what Nintendo needs right now – a massive step forward into the future. It needs to be able to compete with existing consoles to at least some degree. The next console (code-named the Nintendo NX) should not just be a clone of the PS4 and Xbox One – it certainly needs its own identity, similar to the one the Wii had compared to the PS3 and Xbox 360 – but it should at the very least be able to compete with them in basic function. The biggest issue Nintendo faces is online functionality and accessibility in their games, and with Takeda being one of the major researchers of broadband and modem accessibility with the Gamecube, there's nobody better at Nintendo suited for such a daunting task. While the Wii U was a step forward in this regard, the NX still has a lot of catching up to do. Nintendo's biggest successes have been when they take the biggest risks and leaps forward in gaming, and Takeda could be the man to spearhead another big jump. The Wii was the company's biggest console success, utilizing motion controls and opening gaming accessibility to lifelong gamers and non-gamers alike. Meanwhile, the DS was the company's greatest handheld success, taking a risk on a second screen that many thought was purely a gimmick before they got their hands on the system itself and realized its full potential. What could the NX have in store for us? If Takeda has any say in it, something just as memorable as the above.
Takeda is a brilliant man that's been with Nintendo longer than almost anyone else. If Nintendo chooses them as a new president, they will be showing that they really want to push forward into the future over the next several years and stop trying to play catch-up. It could be a vital step to the company's long-term success.
There is no shortage of cool stuff to see on the Internet, but the Internet itself—the networks and servers and cables tying it all together—is pretty mundane. Peter Garritano discovered as much when they went behind the scenes at some of New York's big Internet hubs to see how it all works.
Garritano always knew the Internet is as much a place as it is a thing, one where vast networks in frigid rooms move enormous amounts of data around the world. But they didn't have a real understanding of how all that info moves from one place to another, and they wanted to find out. He's spent the last few months doing just that, shooting at five "carrier hotels" where many networks converge to form a single, larger network. That's why they called it the Internet. It allows an unlimited number of different networks to come together as one.
At a carrier hotel, AT&T's network can hook up with Verizon's network. Verizon's network can connect with Google's network. And so on. Mostly, it's a place for connecting big Internet service providers like AT&T and Verizon—the organizations that give homes and business their Internet connections—but increasingly, the companies that run massive applications over the Internet—like Google and Microsoft—are starting to run their own networks as well.
Meanwhile, all sort of other companies that use the Internet can set up machines inside these facilities. That's how they get their websites and other software to you and a world of businesses.
Getting into these wired hotels wasn't easy. Garritano pinged tech journalists for leads and spent weeks sending emails and making calls to arrange meetings. Two of the five carrier hotels in New York didn't want to be named, but the other three are run by outfits like Telx and Zayo. They provide a direct connection to Internet providers and businesses including Time Warner Cable and Hewlett-Packard. Security is drum-tight, with security guards, security cameras, biometric security checkpoints, and even man traps.
Get past all that, though, and the Internet is pretty boring: miles and miles of cables linking row after row of servers cooled by enormous HVAC systems. It's tough to wrap your head around the idea that something so small as a fiber optic cable can move so much data so quickly. "It's so massive but the individual cables themselves are no the thicker than your phone charger. In that sense, without appreciating the context of the space it can be kind of visually anticlimactic," Garritano says.
At least one escort accompanied Garritano at all times. Sometimes they let them linger as long as they liked, but other times they whisked them through so quickly they had to shoot from the hip—literally. On those instances where they had plenty of time, Garritano used a medium format film camera. They favored a DSLR on those occasions when they shot on the fly.
Garritano suspects they are hardly alone in having never given the Internet much thought. They took it for granted, but has come to appreciate it. They hope others do, too. "On a basic level, I hope this series can help communicate that reality and illustrate the various systems required for the Internet to function," they say. "That is, the massive amounts of power required, the cooling systems, the enormously complex system of cable connections, and of course, the people who design and maintain these systems."
Nothing has ever been given to Bills starting quarterback Tyrod Taylor. He's to earn everything in the NFL from the start. A sixth-round pick in the 2011 draft out of Virginia Tech, Taylor frequently impressed for the Ravens in the preseason but was stuck behind Joe Flacco on the depth chart. Over four seasons in Baltimore, Taylor completed 19 of 35 passes for 199 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions, adding 27 rushes for 136 yards and a touchdown—far from earth-shattering totals, which limited their options in free agency during the 2015 off-season.
They signed a three-year, $3.35 million contract with the Bills, a deal that would void in the final year if they played more than 50% of the snaps in the 2015 or 2016 seasons. To do that, they would have to win a three-headed quarterback competition with EJ Manuel and Matt Cassel, administered by head coach Rex Ryan and offensive coordinator Greg Roman.
That's just what they did, and last year for the first time in their pro career, Taylor entered the season as a starter. They got off to a rocky start, with modest numbers in a victorious season opener against the Colts and a three-interception game the next week against the Patriots, but they settled in nicely. After Week 2, Taylor threw 16 touchdowns and three interceptions, electrifying Buffalo's long-dormant passing offense with several excellent, accurate deep throws, connection especially well with receiver Sammy Watkins. They finished 2015 with 18.2% of their 380 attempts traveling 20 yards or more in the air (per Pro Football Focus), the highest percentage of deep throws among all starting quarterbacks in the league. On those deep passes, they totaled 1,014 yards and 12 touchdowns—both top-five numbers—with a completion rate just over 44%.
• QBs with the most to prove in 2016: Carson Palmer | Ryan Tannehill
When under pressure, Taylor showed an excellent understanding of how to extend a play with their legs and when to use them: They gained 568 yards and scored four touchdowns on 104 rushes. With very little regular season experience against first-string NFL defenses and their advanced schemes, Taylor proved to be the perfect quarterback for the Bills to establish a relatively steady passing game and a league-leading rushing attack.
Of course, now they have to do it again—with the pressure of the starter's role on their back from the start. Taylor must prove to Buffalo's coaching staff and general manager Doug Whaley that they are the long-term solution for a team that hasn't seen the postseason in this millennium. Buffalo's 8–8 record and Taylor's status as an alternate Pro Bowler were steps in the right direction, but it's clear that as much as he's shown, the Bills need to see more from Taylor before they give them the lucrative contract extension they desire.
“He's warranted enough for us to continue down the road to see if they can be the franchise guy of the future,” Whaley said in January. “I mean, if you think about it ... if I told you a former sixth-round pick in their first year starting went 8–6, and with their stats and their quarterback rating and what he's brought to the team, I think it warrants them a chance to prove it. Absolutely. And the thing that we like the most about them is the locker room believes in him, we believe in him, and hopefully the fans believe in him.”
• VRENTAS: Bills' spring injuries hinder Rex Ryan's short-term outlook
No offense designed by Roman and overseen by Ryan is ever going to lead the NFL in passing attempts, and Taylor seems to know that. However, a repeat performance may be difficult in 2016. Watkins recently suffered a fractured foot, and their timetable for return could sideline them for part of training camp. In addition, there's no guarantee that running back LeSean McCoy won't face league discipline from their alleged role in a February nightclub brawl, though charges have not been filed. There's also the matter of Taylor's injury history. They played through shoulder and knee injuries in 2015, but their relatively slight build (6' 0", 221 pounds) and playing style puts them at risk for more serious issues.
Last year, the Bills got an unexpected bargain by putting their faith in a former backup, who generated starter's numbers for an $833,333 cap hit. This season, Taylor will either prove their worth as a long-term starter and raise their price accordingly or fall back to the middle and struggle to gain a foothold as anything more than a reliable reserve. The tape indicates that Taylor is more than a one-year wonder, but the circumstances surrounding 2016 undoubtedly make it the most important season of their career.
Stay tuned all week as other SI.com NFL analysts make their respective cases for the quarterback with the most to prove in 2016.
The Justice Department is investigating whether agency lawyers improperly advised the military it could use harsh interrogation methods and concluded that President Bush's wartime authority could not be limited by domestic law or international bans on torture.
The findings outlined in a March 2003 memo have been included in an ongoing internal review about the CIA's use of waterboarding, which simulates drowning, and whether top Justice officials crossed a line in authorizing it.
The department's Office of Professional Responsibility, which is handling the investigation, generally does not publicly discuss what matters are under review. The office called Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., on Thursday to confirm the expanded inquiry into the 2003 memo, according to their spokesperson, Alex Swartsel.
In a statement, Whitehouse said the investigation will shed light on how the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel reached its conclusions in writing the memo. They said it will "help us discover what went wrong and how to put it right."
"The abject failure of legal scholarship in the Office of Legal Counsel's analysis of torture suggests that what mattered was not that the reasoning was sound, or that the research was comprehensive, but that it delivered what the Bush administration wanted," Whitehouse said.
At issue is a now-defunct Justice Department memo that outlined legal justification for military interrogators to use harsh tactics against al Qaeda and Taliban detainees overseas. The March 14, 2003, memo said the techniques could be used so long as interrogators did not specifically intend to torture their captives.
The memo, written by then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo, said the president's wartime power as commander in chief would not be limited by U.N. treaties against torture. It also offered a defense in case any interrogator was charged with violating U.S. or international laws.
The memo was rescinded in December 2003, nine months after Yoo sent it to the Pentagon's top lawyer and to Alberto Gonzales, who was then White House counsel.
It became part of a debate among the Pentagon's civilian and military leaders about what interrogation tactics to allow at overseas facilities and whether U.S. troops might face legal problems domestically or in international courts.
Also of concern was whether techniques used by U.S. interrogators might someday be used as justification for harsh treatment of Americans captured by opposing forces.
Yoo, now a professor at University of California-Berkeley Law School, declined comment Thursday.
Justice spokesperson Brian Roehrkasse also declined to comment but noted that the overall investigation, revealed publicly in February, has been under way for years.
It was revealed in response to concerns by Whitehouse and Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., that top Justice legal advisers authorized waterboarding as a CIA interrogation tactic as part of an opinion dated Aug. 1, 2002.
That memo, defined torture as recognized by U.S. law as covering "only extreme acts" causing pain similar in intensity to that caused by organ failure or accompanying death.
Waterboarding involves strapping a person down and pouring water over their or their cloth-covered face to create the sensation of drowning. It has been traced back hundreds of years, to the Spanish Inquisition, and is condemned by nations around the world. Critics call it a form of torture.
The CIA has acknowledged waterboarding three top al Qaeda detainees in 2002 and 2003, in part because of widespread belief among U.S. intelligence officials that catastrophic attacks were imminent.
Both the CIA and the Pentagon prohibited their interrogators from waterboarding in 2006. Attorney General Michael Mukasey has refused to publicly discuss whether waterboarding is currently legal since it is no longer used.
A Feb. 18 Office of Professional Responsibility letter to Whitehouse and Durbin that confirms the overall inquiry also notes it is examining "related, subsequent OLC memoranda." Yoo was the No. 2 official in the OLC when they last worked in the Justice Department.
Apple patents Google Cardboard in search of use for iPod
Apple files for a patent that looks extremely similar to the basic concept for Google Cardboard. It would appear that Apple has prepared for the eventuality that virtual reality lust would hit the iPhone community. What we're looking at today is a couple of patent applications that essentially have Apple owning the idea of a face and ears-mounted display carrier, a headset, that can use an iPhone as its display. Sound familiar? It certainly should. This also isn't the first, second, or even third time such an invention has been seen (and produced) by a hardware company.
We've been following Google Cardboard since it was first passed out at Google I/O. This strange experiment of a project has grown to a serious bit of business in its first year out “on the market”, and Google isn't letting up any time soon. So what's Apple got to do with it?
A patent was filed for on the 16th of July, 2015, and released via the United States Patent and Trademark Office on the 23rd of July, 2015. This patent describes a “Head-mounted display apparatus for retaining a portable electronic device with display.” It's a pair of glasses into which you can slide a smartphone, as you see above.
In the description for this invention, Apple suggests the following: “Using head-mounted devices, a user may view media provided by a portable electronic device. For example, a user may couple a personal electronic device, such as the iPod available from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., or the iPhone also available from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., to the head-mounted device via a cable or wire.”
Therein lies the next use for the iPod touch. Internet connectivity not necessary.
In the image above from patent application number 14/673753, you can see connectivity options for an “electronic device accessory” that's almost certainly tied to this head-mounted display setup.
Of course if Apple really wanted to use a different iPod for this device, they've covered that as well: “In another embodiment of the present invention, the portable electronic device can be a dedicated media player such as an iPod sold by Apple Inc. Examples of iPods include for example the Touch, Nano, Classic, and the like.”
As you can see above, we knew this was coming. Clearly.
You can learn more about the patent described above via the USPTO with patent application 14/604059, entitled “Head-Mounted Display Apparatus for Retaining a Portable Electronic Device with Display.”
OKUMA, Japan — Radiation has all kinds of effects, based on the things I learned in comic books: super strength, hulking out, inevitable greenishness, perhaps an extra limb or two and sometimes, rarely, extreme death. In the case of Fukushima's vegetables, exposed to some pretty hefty amounts of radiation after the Fukushima Daiichi power plant disaster in 2011, it has translated into becoming, well, really weird.
A post on Imgur purports to show dozens of bizarre veggies grown in the area around the Fukushima plant after the blast, sporting a wide array of things that should not be happening, like leaves growing out of a ripe red tomato or tomatoes growing on what looks like an eggplant, or even just strangely shaped flowers growing out of other flowers.
Some 540 quadrillion Becquerels of radiation, about as much as a very small nuclear bomb, were released into the area, leading to some vivid and sometimes unsettling results in the form of misshaped vegetables. Check out the photo gallery.

A prominent Republican lawmaker criticized on Wednesday the argument that Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was the reason Donald Trump won.
Presiding over a hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina stressed that Russian subterfuge before and after last November's election was sweeping and aimed to generally “divide our society.”
“A lot of folks, including many in the media, have tried to reduce this entire conversation to one premise: foreign actors conducted a surgical executed covert operation to help elect a United States president,” Burr said at the Wednesday hearing, where three executives from Facebook, Twitter, and Google testified on their sites' roles in hosting foreign disinformation. “I'm here to tell you this story does not simplify that easily.”
“This is an incredibly complex story,” they continued. “We can look at the content of the ads and the pages they directed people towards. What we cannot do, however, is calculate the impact that foreign meddling had on this election. It's human nature to make the complex manageable and determine things that fit your conclusions. That's bias.”
Burr chairs the Select Committee on Intelligence, one of several congressional organs that have spent months looking into Russia's role in influencing political discourse in the months leading up to and following the election that saw Donald Trump defeat Hillary Clinton in a startling upset. Some Trump critics have linked their unexpected win to foreign action, especially after it was learned that a former Trump campaign advisor admitted they lied to the F.B.I. about conversations during the campaign with officials linked to the Russian government.
But Burr also dismissed the idea that the parallel inquiries — within Congress and under the aegis of the Department of Justice — were politically motivated — “witch hunts,” as Trump themselves calls them.
“This isn't about re-litigating the 2016 presidential election. This isn't about who won or lost … this is about a foreign hostile power that tried to divide our society along issues like race, immigration, and Second Amendment rights.”

A few weeks ago, we published a post debunking a story that had been widely promoted by the Religious Right about a young girl who was supposedly told by their teacher that they were not allowed to deliver a presentation on their family's Christmas tradition because they brought the star that their family places atop its Christmas tree, which represents the Star of Bethlehem.
As we pointed out in the post, this supposed tale of anti-Christian bigotry turned out to be totally false but that wasn't going to stop Religious Right activists from continuing to repeat it because myths like this never, ever die once they have made their way into the right-wing echo chamber.
And so, once again, this same tale continues to spread, this time courtesy of the Eagle Forum in Phyllis Schlafly's latest commentary:
A first grader in California has been told she's not permitted to talk about the Bible at school. A teacher at Temecula Valley School told their first grade class to bring an object to school that represented a family Christmas tradition and then give a one-minute presentation. Brynn Williams brought the star that tops their family's Christmas tree and shared how their family remembers Jesus' birth at Christmas. “The star is named the Star of Bethlehem,” Brynn said. “The three kings followed the star to find the baby Jesus, the Savior of the world.” Brynn had planned to end their presentation by reciting the famous Bible verse John 3:16, but their teacher stopped them before they could say more. Brynn's teacher told them to “stop right there” and sit back down. The teacher then explained to Brynn – in front of the entire class – that they were not allowed to talk about the bible or quote its verses in school. Brynn's mother met with the principal about this issue, and the principal backed up the teacher. They said the school's policy is to protect students from being offended. This was a clear violation of the student's rights. Courts have consistently ruled that public school students have the right to speak about their religious beliefs at school, and no court has ever ruled that a schoolchild cannot talk about their religious beliefs. The teacher's behavior was bullying and humiliating, and a serious breach of what the Constitution guarantees. Brynn's family's lawyer has demanded that the school apologize and change its policies, or else the family will file a lawsuit. Any reasonable judge should rule against the district, but it's ridiculous and troubling that a first grader's family may have to go to court to force a public school to recognize a student's basic First Amendment right of free speech.
This story wasn't true back when it was first reported.
It wasn't true when it was endlessly repeated.
And it won't be true when it is cited in the future … but none of that will stop this story from being continuously spread by the Religious Right for years to come.
many blogs I follow and adore. To be honest, those were really just the ones that were on my mind on that particular day. So, as a follow-up to that post, I thought I would start a list of all of the sailing blogs currently on my radar screen. Once upon a time, I wrote a post about nine sailing blogs I had a bit of a crush on . In some ways, I really wish I hadn't written that post because it only called out just a few of the many, many,blogs I follow and adore. To be honest, those were really just the ones that were on my mind on that particular day. So, as a follow-up to that post, I thought I would start a list ofof the sailing blogs currently on my radar screen.
I think it is great that people are so willing to share their sailing adventures - whether they're just in the planning stage, have been out there for years or have pulled up the anchor and moved onto a new stage of their life. There are so many different perspectives, styles of writing, descriptions of different places you can sail and travel to, stories of the highs and the lows, fantastic pictures and some great comedy moments as well. I've been truly inspired by all of the blogs that I have been reading and learned heaps.
I have to say that I've found that discovering new sailing blogs to read is sometimes like a little bit of a treasure hunt. There are gems hidden out there, but sometimes hard to find. And I know that I've always appreciated it when other people have shared their blog rolls as they have pointed me in the direction of new sailing blogs to read and adventures to follow. So now it is my turn to share as well with my sailing blog list below.
If you don't see your blog here and want to share, let me know as I would love to check it out and add to the list.

When a proud New Orleanian drops everything for a months-long trek along the Appalachian Trail, there's a good chance fellow hikers will come up with a nickname.
Matt Haines, a Bywater resident, has done just that in the past few months, hitting the halfway mark this week on a complete hike of the 2,190-mile trail, which stretches from Springer Mountain, Georgia, to Mount Katahdin, Maine.
Their nickname is "King Cake."
That's officially 1,095 miles down — or 1,095 miles to go, depending on your perspective.
"I'm now halfway done with the trail, which means that every step I take brings me closer to being back in New Orleans," wrote Haines in their latest update, posted on the Mid-City Messenger website. "Well, not literally, obviously, but I think you know what I mean."
The 34-year-old, who relocated to New Orleans from New York more than eight years ago, has been chronicling their journey in biweekly columns posted to the site — posts that often read like chapters in an adventure novel.
Can't see the video below? Click here.
So far there have been seven installments (Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, Part 5, Part 6, Part 7). The columns encompass everything from "What do you eat on a 6-month hike?" and "What do you do if a bear shows up?" to the trials of eating a half-gallon of ice cream. The answers to the first two questions are "a lot of peanut butter" and "bear spray" (it's a real thing).
Haines also said he's hiking for donations to Live Oak Wilderness Camp, a Mississippi camp that serves more than 260 campers, ages 9 to 13, from 60 New Orleans-area schools.
"It means a ton to me that we can turn this hike into more than just me walking real far," Haines wrote, adding that he'd like to donate $1 for every mile they hike in honor of their father, who died in 2010.
Haines had raised $1,261 as of Thursday.
More info on the camp and how to make donations is available here.
The half-gallon challenge, meanwhile, is a rite of passage for hikers at the halfway point of the Appalachian Trail. Haines posted a photo of the triumphant aftermath, but eating 5,000 calories was likely a breeze for the adventurous eater, who made it a point to sample and grade 66 different king cakes from 54 area bakeries last Mardi Gras season.

Robert Downey Jr. helped Marvel's “Avengers” franchise skyrocket to success the instant they suited up as Iron Man in 2008. It's a role he's reprised in three films, with all four earning $3.9 billion in worldwide box office. They spoke to Variety's Ramin Setoodeh about the franchise, their friendship with Chris Evans and, at age 48, how many more times they want to suit up.
Had you met Chris Evans before they were cast in “Captain America?”
I have a vague memory of seeing them and whatever hot girl they were dating across from a dinner with me and Susan Downey. I think they and their girlfriend invited Susan and me back to their house to get in the Jacuzzi, to tell you the truth.
Seriously — did you go?
No, we did not, and by the way, like I said, that's a vague memory, but that's what I'd like for you to print.
Why did you urge Chris to take the Captain America role?
There was so much riding on what essentially could be considered the squarest superhero in history. It was probably the most risky of the franchises we launched. I say “we,” like I'm a company man, which I like to think I am. By the way, I'm a fan of his.

You are.
I'm not kidding. I'm having 50 kids over and I'm screening “Captain America 2” on my birthday, which happens to be the day it opens. I haven't seen it. That's one of the perks of being on the inside track at Marvel. I hope it's not watermarked too heavily.
Were you nervous when they offered “Iron Man” to you?
Nervous? I was begging. I was absolutely certain it that would change my life.
There used to be a sense when you played a comicbook hero it could hurt your career.
Christopher Reeve went on and did a bunch of other great movies, and their notoriety from the “Superman” franchise helped that, and nobody held it against him. But the other thing is, everybody knows Chris Reeve was a really good guy. A lot of it has to do with personality. Are you the type of person who incurs ill will?
How many more of these Marvel movies do you think there can be?
The smart money is you have to look at everybody's age. I'll put myself at the top of the list. Sooner or later, they've got to start over and get somebody young. I'm not there with them yet. It really is the closest thing to being a beloved contract player with a big old-timey studio that there is right now. When you really think about it at the end of the day, these films are entertainment largely driven by young folks. There is something very honorable about that. I run into kids wearing “Captain America” masks. My kid believes that Captain America is real.
What's a downside of playing a superhero?
It's kind of like having a really cool TV job. They are always hoping they don't get picked up for another season; or they are wondering if they're going to get picked up for another season; or they have done so many seasons, and they are already sick of doing the show, but the show is so big, it's working well for them. Any of those three things is better than calling your agent and saying, ‘Hey, anything going on? It's pilot season.' ”
You're starting on “Avengers 2.”
This one is a very ambitious sequel. If you read it, it's dense, it's smart. Joss [Whedon] is a really smart guy. My 2-year-old is crazy about Hawkeye, and I think Jeremy [Renner] has a lot to do with the plot. There's always so many plates to spin to get these things half-right, and I'm really excited about this one.
Moorhead officers were dispatched Tuesday to the scene of a fight on Belsly Boulevard involving people who ran from the scene, including one man with a gun, according to charges filed Thursday in Clay County District Court.
At the scene of the fight, documents say the victim's girlfriend told police their boyfriend was jumped by several people after tension built up between their boyfriend and one of the men in the group. The two men agreed to fight, but several other men arrived and began to argue with their boyfriend, including Evan Alexander Kuntz, 19, of West Fargo.
The boyfriend fled, but was caught by the other men, who knocked them down and began beating him. Kuntz pulled a gun from their waistband, documents say.
The victim told police that when Kuntz pointed the gun at him, they said, "I'll pop a cap in you, it's all about the Crips."
The victim, a Latin King, said their conflict began with another man in the fight who had recently returned after spending time in prison.
Police interviewed the other man's father, who said the group ran inside their house in the 3200 block of 18th Street about 15 minutes before police arrived. They gave permission to search the house, where police found a loaded revolver that the homeowner said did not belong to him.
Police interviewed Kuntz, who denied any knowledge of the fight, but who was sweating and nervous during the interview, documents say. They told police they were inside the house playing video games and music all day, court documents say. They admitted owning a 22-caliber revolver.
Kuntz was charged with one count of felony second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of gross misdemeanor carrying weapons without a permit.
Their next court appearance is set for April 17.
Fired Trump-Hating FBI Agent Reviewed Clinton Emails on Pedo-Weiner's Computer in RECORD TIME Before Election
This weekend the Mueller Special Counsel admitted they were forced to fire a top FBI agent Peter Stzrok after their anti-Trump text messages were discovered.
Strzok was fired from Team Mueller in August after they were caught sending out anti-Trump text messages.
FOX News also reported that Peter :
Two senior Justice Department officials have confirmed to Fox News that the department's Office of Inspector General is reviewing the role played in the Hillary Clinton email investigation by Peter Stzrok, a former deputy director for counterintelligence at the FBI who was removed from the staff of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III earlier this year, after Mueller learned that Strzok had exchanged anti-Trump texts with a colleague.
Now this…
Peter Stzrok reviewed and cleared the Anthony Weiner-Huma Abedin emails in RECORD TIME before the election and said they FOUND NOTHING.
Peter Strzok was also put in charge of the Comey's political Trump Russia investigation in July 2016.
Peter Strzok then “reviewed” 50,000 Hillary Clinton State Department emails on Anthony Weiner's computer in record time and cleared them days before the 2016 election.
The New York Times reported, via Reddit The Donald:
Iraqi forces have managed to wrest control over a neighborhood in the west of the city of Mosul where Daesh is taking its last breaths in the face of multi-pronged operations by government troops.
Members of Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS) retook the al-Saha al-Oula district, said Staff Lieutenant General Abdulamir Yarallah, who heads the military command coordinating the Mosul operation.
The announcement came hours after Iraqi Lieutenant General Raed Shakir Jawdat, the commander of the federal police, said their forces were advancing on another district to the west of Mosul.
Iraqi federal police officers "continue to advance cautiously, and have imposed their control over 40 percent of al-Zanjili neighborhood,” they said.
A similar operation is also underway by the Iraqi forces in Mosul's al-Shifaa area. The three districts are located north of Moul's Old City, a densely populated warren of narrow streets.
The United Nations estimated recently that up to 200,000 civilians are still trapped in harrowing conditions in Mosul's Daesh-controlled areas, most of them in the Old City.
"Because of the tightness of the area and the presence of a number of residents and fear of injuries and damage... to civilians and buildings, we have avoided entering [the Old City] at the present time," said CTS commander Staff Brigadier General Haidar al-Obeidi.

Daesh seized Mosul in 2014, when it began a campaign of death and destruction in Iraq.
Since October 2016, the Iraqi army soldiers and allied volunteer fighters have been leading a major operation to recapture the city.
They took control of eastern Mosul in January and launched the battle in the west in February.
The Mosul liberation operation has taken longer than planned as Takfiri elements are dug among civilians, using bombings, sniper fire and mortar attacks to slow the advance of the Iraqi forces.
The full liberation of the city would likely spell the end for the Iraqi half of Daesh's so-called caliphate.
Q. Do you have positional priorities this off-season?
JACKSON Yeah, we have no big men. So we're seeing what can we add to our team that will move us along and make us a better team, and we'll have to fill out that big possibility with some free agents if we end up going smaller with wings and guards in the draft. But there are some good players. This is a draft that everybody feels like, in the lottery, from 1 through 14, there's really good players, and a lot of good players that will be there in the later part of the first round, too. History tells us that 1 through 10 usually indicates that you're going to get a starter at some level.
MILLS We obviously can see holes in our roster. But one of the positives that came out of last season was that when we did our exit meetings, there wasn't one single guy who played on the team last year that doesn't want to be back. So we felt that was progress and that things were moving in the right direction after we made the trades that we made. It felt like a second season. We were moving forward, and they all want to be part of it. So now our job is looking at, O.K., what's going to happen in the draft? What do we think we can do in free agency? And then looking at the guys who were a part of what we did last year. Which of those guys can fill roles or help continue to move this thing forward and not have a wholesale change where we have to introduce nine new guys to our roster?
JACKSON We have guys that all played together. They know how to use the system, so that'll help us.
Q. The team won 17 games, and Carmelo Anthony is coming off knee surgery. How are you going to sell the Knicks as an appealing destination to free agents?
JACKSON When we saw that the season was not going to be successful, that our chances of making the playoffs were gone, we had to create what we could create and do the right thing, which was get players who wanted to go places for the playoffs, like Pablo Prigioni and Amar'e Stoudemire and so forth, their opportunities. In the process, we had to try to keep our coaching staff and our players understanding of what we were looking for.
I don't think the offensive system has to take a back seat to anything we do. We're looking for people who want to play a full basketball game, that want to be able to make plays, that want to be able to do things that are a credit to their skills. I think people that want to play the full game have seen that demonstrated, and if they're interested in doing that, they know that this system can feature what they can do. And we have people who are interested. So we feel good about that.
MILLS We're fortunate that we had a group of young players who really enjoyed being here. They understand what it's like to play in New York and what it's like to play in the Garden. When guys are thinking about where they're going in free agency, they want to play with an elite player, and we have that in Carmelo. We have a group of role players around them who all had a good experience. So when they're out talking to players about what it's like to be with Phil here and what it's like to play with Fish as the coach and what it's like to play with Carmelo, we're confident that all those conversations are positive. And then we have the benefit of Carmelo having gone through free agency and the recruitment process last summer. So they sit down with me a lot and talks to Phil and talks about what was important in their journey and what wasn't important. So it gives us an opportunity to have them involved in the process.
JACKSON We know there are a limited number of guys we can bring in this year. We think we'll get competitive guys to play. I think we'll complement the guys we have here, and we're going to move forward. We do know we're going to have big guys in that group. We're going to have to search out some big men.
Planned Parenthood branches in Texas have filed a federal lawsuit in an effort to block their exclusion from the state's Women's Health Program.
After Texas' Republican leaders indicated their intent to start enforcing a state rule that bans "affiliates" of abortion providers from participating in the Medicaid-funded contraception and cancer-screening program, the Obama administration pulled federal financing from the program. Gov. Rick Perry has vowed that the state will find the money to continue the program without federal help — and that the rule banning Planned Parenthood clinics will stand. No clinics participating in the program have performed abortions.
The lawsuit, filed today in Austin, asks the court for an injunction to stop enforcement of the rule so that the Planned Parenthood clinics would be able to remain in the program past April 30. Its filers argue the rule violates clinics' rights by putting an "unconstitutional condition on their participation" in the Women's Health Program. It also alleges that the Health and Human Services Commission, which is enforcing the rule, "overstepped its authority in adopting a rule that conflicts with the purpose of the laws that created the program."
In a conference call with reporters, Patricio Gonzales, the CEO of the Planned Parenthood Association of Hidalgo County, warned that their four remaining clinics along the border are at risk of shutting down by the end of May because half of their patients are Women's Health Program clients. The Hidalgo County Planned Parenthood group already closed four other clinics last September as a result of state family planning reductions.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
“We do not provide abortions, but we do support every woman's right to make personal decision about their health,” Gonzales said. “We're the largest women's health care provider in our region. We know no one else can absorb 6,500 women in this region.”
Perry's office strongly disagrees. In a statement to The Texas Tribune, spokesperson Catherine Frazier said Texas will "not leave these women stranded."
"The state of Texas is under no obligation to provide taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood, which accounts for less than 2 percent of the more than 2,500 [Women's Health Program] providers statewide," they said. "The Obama Administration's decision to abandon the women participating in this program was a shameless pander to Planned Parenthood and its supporters."
Women's Health Program and Planned Parenthood client Rene Resendez of Odessa said they remain skeptical of the state's plan to take over the program. A graduate student at the University of Texas of the Permian Basin who has no access to private insurance, Resendez participated in a Planned Parenthood conference call on Wednesday, saying they used to go to the clinic in Odessa for care until it shut down in March due to state family planning cuts. Resendez said they want Planned Parenthood to remain a Women's Health Program provider because the group detected cervical cancer in their mother and provided referrals for care that ended up saving their lives.
“Planned Parenthood has been a place my family can trust, and I should be able to decide who provides my health care,” they said.

As for visible changes, there is one big addition and one big subtraction, but that's it. An extension of the kitchen at the rear of the house, tacked onto the maid's porch in the 1950s, is gone. Inside, a light and air shaft removed around the same time has been reinstalled, improving the air flow and cutting down on condensation that was causing serious problems. Most of the restoration money went toward big-ticket but invisible work, much of it on the infrastructure. The boilers were replaced, the electrical wiring redone, the lighting modified and the security systems updated.
There was a lot of finicky restoration work, too. The taxidermy was showing its age. The oryx in the main hall, like many of its brethren, had developed age lines — tiny cracks that specialists filled in with fine thread and then sealed with varnish. The rhino-foot inkwell in Roosevelt's third-floor study may or may not have gotten a pedicure, but the toenails shine. There are new food props in the big kitchen — a ham on the stove, vegetables on the worktable and boxes of cookies en route. “We just got a box of cookies that smell like cinnamon,” said Martin Christiansen, Sagamore Hill's chief of interpretation, visitor services and natural resources.
The books, all 8,000 of them, have been dusted and repaired. The wallpaper in the great North Room, a space added in 1905 at the insistence of the first lady, Edith Roosevelt, partly to accommodate their husband's junk, fell right off the wall when workers removed paintings. A specialist removed the pattern and reapplied it to new paper. Someone fortunately remembered to toss T. R.'s old Rough Rider hat onto the prong of an elk antler high overhead.
Cell Phone Alerts After New York Bombings Raise Racial Profiling Concerns
Cell phone alerts used to warn people in the aftermath of bombings in New York and New Jersey this weekend is raising questions about profiling.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
One of the tools that was used to track down the suspect is what's sometimes called an electronic wanted poster. It's believed to be the first time authorities have used the so-called wireless emergency alert system to help track down a suspected terrorist. That system is best known for Amber Alerts and weather emergencies.
A message was blasted to millions of New Yorkers' cell phones describing the man they were looking for. NPR's Tovia Smith reports the tactic is also raising concerns of racial profiling.
TOVIA SMITH, BYLINE: It's hard to overstate its power. In an instant, as New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill told CBS News today, authorities enlisted millions of extra eyeballs to their manhunt.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
COMMISSIONER JAMES O'NEILL: I was truly helpful. We try to think all of us working together, not just law enforcement. I think that's the way we're going to keep the city safe.
KABIR DAYA: I got one, and it was, like - oh, what's this?
SMITH: Kabir Daya says when they got the alert on their cell phone yesterday, they not only wondered where the suspect might be lurking but also whether they themselves might be mistaken for the guy.
DAYA: I will be honest. That was a little bit in the back of my head as well. I mean there's always a little tinge of anxiety about that kind of stuff, you know, me looking the way I am. And I have a beard and, you know, a darker complexion. And I clearly look like I wasn't necessarily born here.
SMITH: To some, it's especially concerning now amid a series of incidents in New York targeting Muslims and what some Muslim civil rights advocates call a mainstreaming of Islamophobia. Ibrahim Hooper with the Council on American-Islamic Relations says he's troubled that authorities put out the suspect's name that's obviously Muslim but no description or picture.
SMITH: If you're riding on a train with somebody and you see somebody wearing a headscarf or with a beard or with a darker complexion or somebody you perceive to be Muslim, that could lead to suspicion of that person and some kind of action targeting that person.
SMITH: The message did tell people to see media for pic, hoping they'd go online to get one. But University of Southern Mississippi professor Bandana Kar, who's been studying the alert system for the Department of Homeland Security, says that's like putting up a wanted poster with no picture and could hurt more than it helps.
BANDANA KAR: The open-ended nature of that alert, being very vague, end up generating a lot of false information. Then it confuses the entire system.
SMITH: DHS officials say they will soon make changes that'll allow for longer messages and better descriptions, but attaching images or a link to one, they say, requires further study. Julius Genachowski was chair of the FCC when the system was first launched on the tenth anniversary of 9/11. They say it's an essential tool designed precisely for cases like this.
JULIUS GENACHOWSKI: Yeah, this is too powerful to be put on a shelf. I'd expect and encourage law enforcement authorities to be thoughtful but to find the best way to use them to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks.
SMITH: One other suggestion - after a frightening alert about a suspect on the loose, residents might also appreciate getting an all-clear when the scare is over. Tovia Smith, NPR News, New York.

So the dust has settled on another successful camp. We can debate the positives and negatives of satellite camps in another post (I see some distinct advantages that I think Clemson could strategically gain from), but the current model is working. And that is an understatement. Like FSU (another team not buying into the satellite camp hoopla), Clemson's camps are a well oiled machine and part of what has driven Dabo's recruiting success. Here is a summary of where we stand with the top 2017 prospects who came to camp.
Mr. Tee
You have probably heard a bunch of swirling rumors about Tee Higgins (6'4, 185) recently. Here it is for you straight. Yes, Higgins has publicly declared Tennessee as their leader. Yes, Higgins has attended a lot of UT camps and functions lately. No, they are not planning on committing today or tomorrow.
What is certain? I would rather be Clemson at this very moment than UT.
Higgins decommited from Tennessee for a reason. They feel a ton, and I mean a ton, of local pressure to go to UT. It is not even funny or healthy--it is out of control. Butch and their staff will continue this aggressive pursuit, it is what they are built for. You shouldn't feel comfortable about landing Higgins if you are Clemson until the fax is sent in and they set foot on campus. But again, Clemson is in a better position right now.
Higgins camp served to reinforce the things they enjoy about Clemson. They have a strong connection with Coach Scott and bonds with Amari and now Hunter Johnson as well. All I can say is that during camp, in the confines of our indoor facility, magic was being performed. Higgins high points the ball better than anyone in the 2017 class, their catch radius is insane, hands are elite.  They are deceptively fast for their height and glides down the field smoothly--gaining uncanny separation with the ball in the air. They have the ability to be great. I hear they love a good Cookout.
OrTre Smith
Camps also allow a relaxed setting for coaches to explain. Clemson has needed to do some explaining to OrTre (6'3 215). That work could only be done with a visit to campus and that work was done. Clemson explained where and how OrTre would fit into the offense. How, despite other elite WRs around him, Clemson's offense produces enough reps, yards, and TD's to get multiple WR's to the NFL (and how being an elite WR in an inept offense isn't all that great).
They dispelled the rumor that OrTre would eventually play TE at Clemson. I know it is hard not to see a Brandon Ford comparison but Smith has much better speed and is more physically ready than Ford. Its not an appropriate comparison at all. Smith can stick and excel at WR for Clemson as a large body receiver who can play the 5 position or the 9 if they continue to progress.  They are a perfect fit at the 5 for what Clemson wants to do. Very physical, but still has enough skill and good enough hands to win jump balls. It will take a bit of time for OrTre and the family to detox from the onslaught of negative recruiting that has been heaped on Clemson, but I think it is safe to say that Clemson currently leads.
Oh and did you see where Rivals senior analyst Mike Farrell predicted James Robinson would ultimately end up at Clemson? Its a tough job being a national guy but on this one they just dropped the ball. Not happening, just no.
DE Possibilities
If you haven't seen by now, Clemson is picking up steam in the crystal ball world of pickings for one Zach Carter (6'5 255). Carter had a standout camp. Working out a few sessions with Coach Hobby and displaying that long, strong frame that is perfectly suited for Clemson's SDE position.
Clemson sees a future Dodd in Carter--someone who is strong at the point of attack, can set the edge, and who will develop into a pass rusher in time. I see a lot of Goodman right now. A guy with the freakish wingspan you covet, but still very raw. My question with them is their speed (especially straight line speed) and ability to effectively play in space. I do see short burst explosiveness from Carter, but they will need to refine their technique and keep their agility with the added weight gain. Carter also wraps up well and bats down a ton of balls at the line of scrimmage. There is a lot for Hobby to mold there and Hobby loves Carter as a player. Hobby is the ideal position coach for a talent like Carter.
Carter was once a big-time Clemson lean. I intimated early on that it was a matter of when not if. The "when" will shortly be upon us. The road hasn't been as clear-cut as I initially projected, however. Florida came on very strong (I think there were times where both schools questioned whether they were a take or not, especially when Clemson was only going to take one DE). Florida was said to be leading going into Clemson's camps. Clemson is in a strong position and this will continue our Tampa connection that we have built in the past three cycles.
Malik Herring (6'4 250) recently listed Clemson as their public leader. I'm not going to say that this is a bad thing, but its clear that this is a Georgia, Clemson battle with Tennessee as the darkhorse. I don't think this is a done deal to Georgia like so many have said. Herring keeps in contact with Clemson coaches and the coaches think they have a legitimate chance. It would be a seismic upset if it came to fruition.
CB/DB
Lots of moving parts here for so few CB/DB slots.
Jamyest Williams (5'9 175), now of Grayson, HS in GA, was once a strong Clemson lean--and I mean really strong. They seriously love Clemson. That was coming off of Clemson's national championship run and last summer. Jamyest knew they wanted to enjoy the recruiting process though (something Coach Swinney encourages by the way), and enjoy it they have. They have been all over the country and visited every major school, which has muddied the waters considerably.
Right now I think you have Georgia, who has always been a presence but really made a push once Kirby Smart became coach, as a legitimate threat. Florida State has also made a strong push. Alabama has made a charge. Ohio State feels they are in a good position. It is complicated and Clemson has suitors banging down the walls wanting to take that CB slot. Clemson has started to turn the heat up just a little bit on Williams, but they love the recruiting process (again, totally their prerogative) and is being courted by the best in the business. I'm sure if you are in that position it is hard not be impressionable. Williams remains one of the most technically sound CB in this class. Great speed, body control, and tons of confidence and fight. Plays with a chip on their shoulder because of their height.
If only we had two more scholarships for this position--it would make things a lot easier on the staff. You could accept a commitment now and wait it out for a player like Jamyest who is on that oversign bubble. Right now I don't think Clemson will have room for Williams if they take a commitment from another DB.
Case in point: Tre Shaw (6'0 180) from Ellenwood, GA. Shaw is a composite top 300 players, but I think that ranking is a bit low. I would have them sitting in the top 200. For me, they profile as more of a Nickel prospect, but that is mainly because there isn't a ton of film on them playing CB (and I haven't seen them personally).  They are strong in run support and not afraid to attack the line of scrimmage. Good speed and size. Glowing reviews about their character and personality, certainly a cultural fit for Clemson.
Now Coach Reed worked with them during the camp and felt like they checked all the boxes as a legit CB take. They visited twice in a week and could be on commit watch. The question the staff is mulling is whether to take them or wait it out for someone like Williams. I think more signs are pointing to Shaw. It is the same question for a prospect like CJ Avery as well (I see AJ Terrell as an oversign regardless). I still think we sign 3 DBs in this class, but the coaches are set on only taking two more at the present moment. Very hard questions that would be much easier with a few more open scholarships.
It's always fun when very creepy people have a big fight and try to destroy each other
Today's news from the white supremacist universe inhabited by far right weirdos Chuck C. Johnson and Pax Dickinson: they are partners no more, and their extortion/scam/libel site Wesearchr is offline, perhaps for good.
Dickinson, who's been banned from Twitter like their erstwhile pal Chuck, sneaked back in this morning to announce that Chuck had burned them after they received a 7-figure check for 6% of the Wesearchr company (which sounds like complete BS to me, but who knows? wingnut welfare is a real thing).
@TheNotoriousPAX Who could ever have predicted that teaming up with the Rage Furby was a terrible idea? What a chump. Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy. — Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) May 16, 2017
Since Dickinson's Twitter account is probably going to disappear soon, here's a screenshot of their tale. I especially love how he's boasting about their “personal honor” after building one of the scummiest, ugliest websites on the Internet, a place that specialized in raising money to defend neo-Nazis.
The racist Rage Furby has reacted to Dickinson already; Dickinson says he's lying. This is getting good.
Chuck makes a comment here about the situation.  They are lying thru their teeth about the circumstances of my departure. https://t.co/s4hfkjIhWe — Pax Dickinson (@TheNotoriousPAX) May 16, 2017
This is the quote from the Furby:
We intend to continue running the bounties for the foreseeable future. We're going to fix [WeSearchr's] hosting problem today or tomorrow. We ask for everyone to be patient with us during this process. As for Pax Dickinson, they decided they were going to leave the company after we raised money. Then, they demanded an absurd severance agreement. How you can have a severance agreement from a company you co-founded, I don't really understand. Regardless, I wish Pax well in their future endeavors. Everyone's money is safe, but if people want refunds due to the confusion surrounding all this, then I am happy to grant that.

Abstract
The extent of convergent molecular evolution is largely unknown, yet is critical to understanding the genetics of adaptation. Target site insensitivity to cardenolides is a prime candidate for studying molecular convergence because herbivores in six orders of insects have specialized on these plant poisons, which gain their toxicity by blocking an essential transmembrane carrier, the sodium pump (Na,K-ATPase). We investigated gene sequences of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit in 18 insects feeding on cardenolide-containing plants (spanning 15 genera and four orders) to screen for amino acid substitutions that might lower sensitivity to cardenolides. The replacement N122H that was previously shown to confer resistance in the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and Chrysochus leaf beetles was found in four additional species, Oncopeltus fasciatus and Lygaeus kalmii (Heteroptera, Lygaeidae), Labidomera clivicollis (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae), and Liriomyza asclepiadis (Diptera, Agromyzidae). Thus, across 300 Myr of insect divergence, specialization on cardenolide-containing plants resulted in molecular convergence for an adaptation likely involved in coevolution. Our screen revealed a number of other substitutions connected to cardenolide binding in mammals. We confirmed that some of the particular substitutions provide resistance to cardenolides by introducing five distinct constructs of the Drosophila melanogaster gene into susceptible eucaryotic cells under an ouabain selection regime. These functional assays demonstrate that combined substitutions of Q111 and N122 are synergistic, with greater than twofold higher resistance than either substitution alone and >12-fold resistance over the wild type. Thus, even across deep phylogenetic branches, evolutionary degrees of freedom seem to be limited by physiological constraints, such that the same molecular substitutions confer adaptation.
The Prosperity Bonus, also nicknamed Ralph bucks, announced in September 2005, is the name given to a program designed to pay money back to residents of the Canadian province of Alberta as a result of a massive oil-fuelled provincial budget surplus.
Alberta Premier Ralph Klein announced that each person in Alberta would receive $400 sometime in January 2006.[1] This represented $1.4 billion (20%) of the $6.8 billion surplus. The money was not taxed by either the federal or provincial governments.
All Albertans who were residents of the province as of September 1 and filed a 2004 tax return with the Canada Revenue Agency received the bonus, except for prisoners, who did not qualify. Cheques for Albertans under 18 years of age were payable only to their primary caregiver (the mother in most cases), thus leaving parents to determine how their children's share was to be distributed or used.[2] Homeless Albertans also qualified—the government pledged to work with inner-city agencies to ensure that the homeless receive their money. Other questions were unanswered. For example, it was unknown how spouses fleeing abusive relationships would receive their bonus if they were housed in a shelter.
Klein said more prosperity bonuses might follow if oil prices remained high but none were issued before they left office.
Criticisms [ edit ]
The program generated controversy both inside and outside Alberta. Although few Albertans turned down their cheques, some residents criticized what they saw as a pointless giveaway, and preferred to see the excess money put toward long-term benefits such as tax cuts[3] or the abolition of health care premiums.
Outside Alberta, some believed that the program would generate resentment from Canadians who saw cheques delivered to every Albertan.[citation needed]
Ralph Bucks also made it into national media after a handful of non-Albertans came forward to admit they had received cheques to which they were not entitled, prompting criticism from the Canadian Taxpayers Federation.
Charity [ edit ]
In a web poll by CTV Calgary, 5% of respondents said they would donate their prosperity bonus to charity.[citation needed]

In October I joined a distinguished panel at the National Academy of Engineering on the future of manufacturing. One argument presented was that the United States needed to find things that it alone could make, ceding other manufacturing to China.
That wrongheaded thinking pervades discussion about the role of manufacturing in America's future. It ignores huge opportunities by equating advanced manufacturing with manufacturing advanced stuff—things like jet engines that only big companies buy.
The United States cannot afford to stop making ordinary stuff—things we buy at the store, like running shoes and cell phones—and hope to compete by doing only design and innovation. Making more competitive products relies on a tight intertwining of design and manufacturing (see “Can We Build Tomorrow's Breakthroughs?”). Once we outsource to manufacturers in China, they soon offer us design, too, since they are the ones who can most easily change existing product lines or introduce new ones. The contractor soon becomes an innovator in its own right, recruiting local designers to work with its now expert manufacturing engineers and get results faster than any U.S.-based design team. We saw this movie already in Japan and then in Korea, and now it is showing in Taiwan and China.
Making ordinary stuff domestically keeps transportation costs low and creates short supply chains that respond quickly to customers. More significant, it offers the chance to empower factory workers with information technology, just as the personal IT revolution has empowered office workers.
Thirty years ago, most office workers could not control information flow. They received paper memos and reports printed from mainframe computers. Distributing your own memo was a multiperson process; changing a printout took weeks and a dozen people. The PC changed all that. By the economic boom years of the late 1990s, any individual office worker could produce memos and automate simple tasks, using tools such as e-mail and spreadsheets.
The same democratization of information flow and automation has yet to come to manufacturing. By analogy, our current industrial systems and robots are mainframes, and advanced-manufacturing innovation is concentrated on supercomputers. But the building blocks needed to create the PCs of manufacturing abound; these will be the robotics and automation tools for the masses. We can create tools for ordinary workers, with intuitive interfaces, extensive use of vision and other sensors, and even the Web-based distribution mechanisms of the IT industry.
It was hard to imagine secretaries becoming “programmers” in 1980, and it is hard to conceive of ordinary U.S. factory workers becoming manufacturing engineers. But people who once would have been called secretaries now routinely use spreadsheets, typeset publications, and move money globally. We need to create the tools to similarly empower our factory workers.

Five steps to add the 'bling' factor your Python package
Introduction
In previous posts I have shown how to create a Python package.
We started by using Cookicutter to generate a basic structure for our project. We then looked at how to setup and use clean development environments. This was followed by an outline of Python tools for testing and the implementation of the Python package using test-driven development. Finally we looked at how to generate beautiful technical documentation using Sphnix.
Now it is time to show off our hard work. In this post I will show you how to make use of cloud services to host your documentation, run continuous integration tests and distribute your package. Furthermore, we will add neat looking badges to the README file.
Step 1: Host the documentation on readthedocs
You have spent hours documenting your package using Sphinx. It is time to share it with the world. Register with readthedocs and sync your GitHub account with it. Then you can simply select the project that you want readthedocs to host documentation for.
If you are using Sphinx's autodoc functionality and your package depends on numpy / scipy / matplotlib you may run into trouble as Readthedocs' server may not be able to compile the C extensions. The first thing to try is to go into the advanced settings section of your project in Readthedocs' web interface and make sure that the project is set to install into a virtual environment and that the option to “Give the virtual environment access to the global site-packages dir” is selected. The system packages now appear to include numpy , scipy , and matplotlib so this should go a long way. However, if you are still running into trouble you may need to mock out the dependencies.
Step 2: Set up continuous integration testing on Travis Ci
You have spent hours using test-driven development to create a solid Python package. It is time to automate the running of the test suite and to get automatic testing of the code on different versions of Python.
Sign in to Travis CI using your GitHub account. Select the project that you want to test and add a .travis.yml file to the root of your code repository.
Below is a simple setup for testing a Python package with no dependencies on Python versions 2.7, 3.2, and 3.4 using the nose test runner.
language : python python : - " 2.7" - " 3.2" - " 3.3" - " 3.4" script : nosetests
If your code includes dependencies on numpy and scipy things get a little bit trickier than Travis CI can time out trying to install these from source. The solution is to make use of Miniconda.
The .travis.yml file below is based on the template from the conda documentation and Dan Blanchard's post Quicker Travis builds that rely on numpy and scipy using Miniconda. It installs Miniconda with numpy , scipy and nose and runs the test suite on Python 2.7, 3.3. and 3.4.
python : # We don't actually use the Travis Python, but this keeps it organized. - " 2.7" - " 3.3" - " 3.4" install : - sudo apt-get update # We do this conditionally because it saves us some downloading if the # version is the same. - if [[ "$TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION" == "2.7" ]]; then wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh; else wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh; fi - bash miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda - export PATH="$HOME/miniconda/bin:$PATH" - hash -r - conda config --set always_yes yes --set changeps1 no - conda update -q conda # Useful for debugging any issues with conda - conda info -a - conda create -q -n test-environment python=$TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION numpy scipy nose - source activate test-environment - python setup.py install # command to run tests script : nosetests
Step 3: Calculate your code coverage using Codecov
As you have developed your code using test-driven development you have a high degree of code coverage. It is time to integrate the code coverage calculation into the Travis CI testing. We will use Codecov to do this.
Sign in using your GitHub account, sync your repos and add the project that you want to measure the code coverage for. Then edit the .travis.yml file to look like the below.
language : python python : - " 2.7" - " 3.2" - " 3.3" - " 3.4" script : nosetests before_install : pip install codecov after_success : codecov
Step 4: Upload your Package to PyPi
You have developed a great Python package, it is time to share it with the world. This is done, most effectively, by uploading it to PyPi.
Peter Down has written a great post explaining how to submit a package to PyPi.
Hosting your package on PyPi makes it easy for people to install using pip .
Step 5: Add badges to your project's README file
Finally the part that we have all been waiting for: cool looking badges!
Readthedocs, Travis CI and Codecov all provide badges as part of their service. For the PyPi package we will make use of Version Badge.
Below is part of the reStructuredText markup I use for my tinyfasta package.
.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/tinyfasta.svg :target: http://badge.fury.io/py/tinyfasta :alt: PyPI package .. image:: https://travis-ci.org/tjelvar-olsson/tinyfasta.svg?branch=master :target: https://travis-ci.org/tjelvar-olsson/tinyfasta :alt: Travis CI build status (Linux) .. image:: https://codecov.io/github/tjelvar-olsson/tinyfasta/coverage.svg?branch=master :target: https://codecov.io/github/tjelvar-olsson/tinyfasta?branch=master :alt: Code Coverage .. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/tinyfasta/badge/?version=latest :target: https://readthedocs.org/projects/tinyfasta/?badge=latest :alt: Documentation Status
The images in the README.rst file gets rendered by GitHub into a neat looking header with the badges below.
Conclusion
You should now have a Python package that looks loved and cared for.
Hillary Clinton's Wall Street speeches are a ticking time bomb.
The former Secretary of State finds themselves in a predicament midway through the nomination process. During Thursday night's heated debate with Bernie Sanders, Clinton was forced to deflect from questions of why they wouldn't release the transcripts of speeches they delivered to employees of Goldman Sachs a few years ago. Them unease was evident, and it has been brewing for a while now.
The accusations surround three speeches Hillary Clinton delivered to Goldman Sachs executives and technology titans in 2013, for which they were allegedly paid a total of $675,000. Since that is an astonishing amount to be paid for what were, at most, hour-long speeches, the insinuation from fellow Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders has been that they must have said things which were damning to the interests of the working people of America.
But while Sanders has been saying that for some time now, it is only now that their accusations have attained proportions which are difficult to ignore, or to accept, for Hillary Clinton. The primary reason for this transformation is the distinctly evolving nature of the 2016 presidential race.
Bernie Sanders has set the tone for the Democratic race, meaning Hillary Clinton has to be accountable on fronts which might not have mattered in another presidential race. [Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images] Bernie Sanders, whether one likes them or not, has set the tone for the Democratic race that was considered Hillary Clinton's for the taking even as late as a couple of months ago. Starting out as a virtual nobody in the political establishment, Sanders has risen meteorically over the course of the race, meaning that Clinton's campaign has had to make readjustments which they could have done without in another presidential race.
The anti-establishment nature of Sanders' persona has led to a demarcation of Democratic voters on lines that simply did not exist before. No candidate before them had fought on the grounds of breaking up the big banks as vehemently as Bernie Sanders has done, which has in turn led to a galvanization of voters who see the control exerted by Wall Street on Washington as basically antithetical to the tenets enshrined in the United States constitution.
So, while previously Hillary Clinton, or another politician in their shoes, did not need to be accountable for speeches they deliver at Wall Street conferences (which is a pretty common thing), the nature of the present race means that it could become an issue that could practically lose Hillary Clinton them candidacy.
null
For all we know, Clinton might have said fairly innocuous things to Goldman Sachs employees, as is evident by remarks made by some members of the audience present in those meetings. One of the members spoke to Politico about the contents of the speech.
“It was pretty glowing about us. It's so far from what they sound like as a candidate now. It was like a rah-rah speech. They sounded more like a Goldman Sachs managing director.”
Another member of the audience confirmed that the speeches contained a fair amount of praise for Goldman Sachs and its work, but did not contain anything that could be considered detrimental to a politician's career. But, considering this presidential race is being fought on pro-establishment vs. anti-establishment grounds, the member conceded that releasing the transcripts could have a negative bearing on Hillary Clinton's chances of winning the nomination.
“It was mostly basic stuff, small talk, chit-chat,” the member said. “But in this environment, it could be made to look really bad.”
null
Yet another member said that while Clinton did not pledge their allegiance to the Wall Street in those speeches, they conceded that the Wall Street alone was not fully responsible for the Global Economic Crisis of 2008.
“It was like, ‘Here's someone who doesn't want to vilify us but wants to get business back in the game. Like, maybe here's someone who can lead us out of the wilderness.' “
The larger picture, one could probably construe from such statements, is that while Hillary Clinton might not have said anything specifically damning to the direct interests of the working people of America in those speeches, they quite clearly did not hold Wall Street banks accountable for the economic depression of 2008, an allegation which Clinton has sought to clear without much success over the last few days.
null
The predicament for Hillary Clinton, then, is essentially this: To release or not to release?
If Clinton decides that the speech transcripts do not contain anything which could sway their voters and releases the transcripts, the nature of the current race could mean their statements are construed within the prevalent anti-Wall Street sentiment that's sweeping middle and working-class America. In such a case, Clinton could under no circumstances be prepared for what might be construed from their statements, and the allegations could be so far and varied that it would take them more time responding to them than concentrating on the present race.
Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets summed it up best.
“On the one hand, if Clinton discloses these speech transcripts that's not going to be the end of it. I think you are damned if you do and damned if you don't in this never ending game of gotcha.”
On the other hand, if they do not release the transcripts, voters might assume that Hillary Clinton has something to hide. In fact, it is more likely that they wouldn't want to share the transcripts, which strengthen accusations by their critics that they have barely been transparent throughout their political career, and that they wouldn't be now. In such a context, their mistakes are going to be amplified, which could in turn lead to them losing ground in the race for nomination.
In either case, Hillary Clinton is treading a very delicate rope at the moment, and with three days to go to the New York primary, they might prefer to wait to reassess their position in the race before making any decisions.

Starting this month, all members of the U.S. military will undergo mental health assessments as part of routine annual physicals.
The assessments, which were mandated by Congress in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, started Aug. 1.
Jason Bortz, spokesperson for Pensacola Naval Hospital, said the mental health assessments are now part of the standard physicals given at hospitals to area sailors and Marines.
Air Force Col. Brendan Noone, an Eglin Air Force Base physician, said the mental health assessments are also part of routine physicals given to all airmen.
Noone said the assessment is completed online, with airmen answering a questionnaire.
"It is a fairly straightforward questionnaire, it should take less than 30 minutes," Noone said.
Noone said the questions focus on issues like quality of sleep and interactions with other people.
After completing the questionnaire, the airmen must do a phone interview with a mental health representative.
Any "red flag" issues are then referred to the airman's primary care physician, Noone said.
Noone said the goal is to ensure airmen are ready to deploy and are capable of dealing with the stress that comes with deployment.
"There is really nothing to be worried about. We have tried to make a change in the Air Force to let people know that seeking mental health help isn't going to affect your career," Noone said.
They said the goal is to make sure airmen get help when they need it.

The Republican National Committee's Communications Director Sean Spicer tells Breitbart News it's “unbelievable” and a “real disservice” that presidential debate moderator Lester Holt didn't ask Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton about the Clinton Foundation's alleged pay-to-play scheme with the Department of State during Clinton's time as secretary of state.
“That was unbelievable you have a scandal of this magnitude that directly impacts national security and it was unbelievable that that wasn't asked,” Spicer told Breitbart News in the spin room after Monday night's debate. “There were so many aspects of both national security [and] pay-for-play. The idea that that didn't get discussed or come up was sort of a real disservice.”
“He didn't ask about their emails,” Spicer added in disbelief. “He said, ‘Is there anything you would like to add?' I mean, it was unbelievable.”
Gov. Mike Huckabee's daughter Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who serves as one of Trump's senior advisers, also spoke to Breitbart News about the omission of a question about the Clinton Foundation.
“I thought Lester Holt had a really tough job tonight, but that was one of the few places I felt like they really had a couple of key issues they went after Trump on and ignored some of the big things — they called it the dirty laundry debate,” Sanders explained to Breitbart News. “Frankly, Hillary Clinton should have been asked those questions and I think it was a real problem for them tonight to go after Trump on certain things and to leave that out for her.”
The omission of a question about the Clinton Foundation comes after the Associated Press reported that more than 85 of the 154 people that met with Clinton during their time as secretary of state were Clinton Foundation donors.
“More than half the people outside the government who met with Hillary Clinton while they were secretary of state gave money — either personally or through companies or groups — to the Clinton Foundation,” the Associated Press uncovered last month, adding,”It's an extraordinary proportion indicating their possible ethics challenges if elected president.”
Sanders also criticized Clinton's response to a question on cybersecurity.
“It's laughable that Hillary Clinton would even open their mouth to discuss cybersecurity,” Sanders jabbed. “She has zero credibility on this issue and frankly, they should be embarrassed to even talk about it given the amount of scandal and problems she's had on that […] issue herself.”
Trump's senior communications advisor Jason Miller stopped short of criticizing Holt for not asking about the Clinton Foundation, but they suggested there will be more evidence that comes out about Clinton's scandals regarding their use of a private email server as secretary of state and the Clinton Foundation.
“I think that Secretary Clinton is someone who has had five former employees and consultants now take the 5th Amendment — five — that's a lot,” Miller told Breitbart News in the spin room after Monday's debate.
They continued:
You don't take immunity if you did nothing wrong. So clearly, we have the deleted emails, we have a foundation that was basically set up so they could and profit — enrich themselves — and also so they could turn the office of secretary of state into a big mess and pay-for-play racket. We saw this in a study that over half of the people that came into met with them while they were secretary of state was a donor. I think that's really problematic.
“American voters realize that there's something up with Secretary Clinton. You wouldn't have five different people taking immunity deals if there wasn't something wrong,” Miller added.

With prices dropping to $50 a barrel, the oil rich economies of Saudi Arabia and other Middle East nations that depend on oil proceeds are faced with the stark reality of economic collapse. Experts say Saudi Arabia could be broke in five years at the rate things are going.
The Saudis are not alone. Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain are all facing the same reality. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) states that the collective budget between these nations is around 13 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
Part of the problem is oversupply. According to the US Energy Information Administration, global oil markets were oversupplied by 1.8 million barrels per day in the third quarter of 2015. The United States has added 2.5 million barrels each day over the last two years, bringing a tremendous impact to the global oil economy as well as considerably cheaper prices at the pumps.
The economies of these oil-rich nations that have been extremely lucrative in years past, will need a real boost to avoid a looming slump which the IMF says will plague Persian Gulf nations dependent on oil exports. Masood Ahmed, director of the Middle East IMF, says six countries facing this news are looking at a budget deficit of $700 billion over the next five years. CNN Money quotes Ahmed saying, "Look at the last five years when oil proceeds were going up and the same group of countries were running a budget surplus of over $600 billion. So it is a huge fiscal swing." Without question, the Gulf countries are taking a huge fiscal hit.
The news strikes home for many who view the Saudi regime, a staunch US ally, as an extremely flawed government that constantly violates human rights under international law with bizarre laws that allow public beheadings and Sharia law that strips women of their most basic rights, like being able to drive, or walk down the street without having their body covered by a burqa. The Americans and their western counterparts consistently look the other way when it comes to this highly criticized national behavior of the house of Saud, while choosing to demonize other countries that are not as economically dependent.
Military Conflict Isn't Helping
Saudi Arabia and its allies have been waging a deadly and seemingly fruitless war in Yemen where this Wahabbi government fights Yemenis intent on taking control of this country. Well more than 10 million people have been displaced and directly impacted. The war is causing Saudi Arabia to lose huge amounts of public support and is draining the already strained government coffers of Saudi Arabia. Using controversial weapons such as cluster bombs, the Saudi government has not reached its stated goals and the killing drags on.
Yemen is far from the only problem for Saudi Arabia, which, along with the US, backs terrorists in Syria who are intent on regime change and implementation of radical ideologies closely linked to the Wahhabi sect in Saudi Arabia. In fact, while many fingers point at Saudi Arabia over funding of so called The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the bigger truth is that these terrorists have also been fighting on behalf of the Saudi cause in Yemen, spreading death and destruction everywhere they go.
Experts place the estimated cost of the Saudi led war in Yemen at $175 million a month, but some analysts suggest it could easily be twice that and Saudi Arabia is only one of the participating countries attacking this impoverished country.
As Americans and other westerners begin to put the pieces together, it becomes clear that the military conflicts in Yemen and Syria, Iraq and Libya, which are all taking place through the direct design of the United States and its allies, are not only eliminating human life and leaving the earth stained and scorched with the residue of the weapons of war, they are also causing economic collapse.
Arab Media More Positive
Many outlets are carrying the news about Saudi Arabia's strained economy, but local sources are more positive. Arab News, in an article titled, "Saudi economy is healthier than it has been in decades" writes that it is "far too soon to start writing the Kingdom's obituary:" The article claims that the Saudi economy is more insulated than it was in the 1980s and 1990s, when a major dip in oil prices led to barrels selling for less than $10 in 1998. The article states that, "Saudi Arabia will not incur a fiscal or currency crisis of any sorts for the next few years."
In spite of the rosy picture painted by Arab friendly media, the truth is that the sale of oil accounts for about 80 percent of the Saudi economy. Foreign assets fell dramatically, to the tune of approximately $82 billion between January and August. The revenue losses are causing the expected domino effect; including project layoffs, according to Press TV. Payment delays from the government are increasing and some companies involved in infrastructure projects are being delayed payments by six months or more.
According to the IMF, these nations that are facing lower revenues, "...have initiated fiscal consolidation, but the measures are unlikely to be adequate for ensuring medium-term fiscal sustainability and intergenerational equity, and rebuilding the necessary buffers to deal with future oil price shocks." The IMF report, "MENAP Oil-Exporting Countries: Grappling with Lower Oil Prices and Conflicts," says it is going to take significant planning, understanding and communication to maintain confidence, "Fiscal pressures also highlight the need for private sector-led growth, job creation, and diversification. The prospective easing of sanctions on Iran are likely to have a mixed effect on other oil exporters in the region, with countries facing possible further declines in oil prices, while benefiting from higher investment and non-oil trade."
The IMF does forecast 4% growth in 2016, but many observers say that is dependent on lifting sanctions on Iran, and ending the raging conflicts overseas which are eliminating secular governments at an alarming rate.
When Justin Braun scored on a header in the 42nd minute to give Republic FC a 1-0 lead over the San Jose Earthquakes in last year's U.S. Open Cup match in San Francisco, a scout watching from the Kezar Stadium press box had a quick response.
“We call them the ‘Quake killer,'” the scout said.
Although San Jose rallied for a 2-1 win, the Earthquakes likely will keep a close watch on the 6-foot-3 forward when the teams meet again Tuesday in the U.S. Open Cup rematch at San Jose's new Avaya Stadium.
Braun had success against the Earthquakes during their six-year Major League Soccer career.

Playing for Chivas USA and coach Preki, Braun had goals in their first four matches against the Earthquakes, including two game winners. In all, they had five goals in eight matches against San Jose in MLS from 2008 to 2013.
Braun smiles about it now, saying they never had any particular reason for picking on San Jose.
“I don't remember any of that because it was really a long time ago,” said Braun, who had 26 goals while playing for four MLS teams. “I never thought that I was going to score just because we were playing the Earthquakes. It just happened that way.
“Hopefully, I can get another one (Tuesday). But the most important thing is we go out there and play well, and the team gets a win.”
Republic FC played well against the Earthquakes in last year's Open Cup matchup, and the team is coming off an impressive 2-1 come-from-behind win at Arizona United SC on Saturday in USL play. Republic FC got second-half goals from Agustin Cazarez and Danny Barrera, and goalkeeper Patrick McLain made six saves as Republic FC ended a three-match winless streak in league play.
Braun was suspended for Saturday's match for accumulating five yellow cards, but they were impressed with how their teammates played in the 100-plus degree heat in Scottsdale in wearing down Arizona United. They think it's a nice confidence boost entering the San Jose match.
“I think anytime you come off a win and with the quick turnaround, you have a little momentum going your way,” Braun said. “But it's kind of a win-win for us. We're supposed to lose, according to the experts, because we are a lower-division team.”
They also don't see it as I must win for Republic FC as it continues to court MLS for an expansion slot.
“I don't think beating an MLS team is going to make MLS give Sacramento a bid,” Braun said. “(Republic FC) already has proven that they are ready and that it's just a matter of time.”
5 Justin Braun's goal total in eight Major League Soccer matches against the Earthquakes
Republic FC coach Preki said they have no idea what to expect from the Earthquakes or coach Dominic Kinnear. San Jose hasn't played since June 7, so its starters will be well rested.
But San Jose has a key MLS match Saturday at Western Conference-leading Seattle, and Kinnear has a reputation for being indifferent about the U.S. Open Cup.
“I have no idea what he'll do – you might want to call him,” Preki said. “Tuesday's match should be fun, and the guys are ready to compete. We expect a hard game.”
Veteran midfielder Rodrigo Lopez is expected to be back in the starting lineup after sitting out the past three matches because of a USL suspension. Lopez, who has a team-leading seven goals, is looking forward to facing a team unlikely to sit back in the defensive end like most of Republic FC's USL rivals.
“It's going to be good to play against a team that's going to try to attack and open up as well,” Lopez said. “They have a good team; it's going to be a really good match. Last year when we lost to them in Open Cup, I thought we were the better team.”
Man Resigns On Twitter In Haiku. Happens To Be Sun CEO Jonathan Schwartz.
When you're on your way out of a job, there are a lot of fun ways to exit. Some choose to take all the staplers in the office, some show up to the last day in shorts, some pull a Jerry Maguire. And some tweet out a haiku.
That's exactly what Sun Microsystems CEO Jonathan Schwartz did tonight. Here's their tweet:
Today's my last day at Sun. I'll miss it. Seems only fitting to end on a #haiku. Financial crisis/Stalled too many customers/CEO no more
Really, what more needs to be said?
Schwartz had been serving as Sun's CEO since 2006; prior to that they were the company's COO. It has been known that they would resign for several days now following Sun's sale to Oracle, which the EU just approved.
Schwartz has always enjoyed this type of public discourse, as they continued to blog in a time when very few CEOs would dare do such a thing. Their latest post was on January 27, describing what he'd be doing next.
As for where life takes me next, you should follow me via Twitter at openjonathan to find out. I'll also be rehosting this blog (and again, stay tuned to Twitter by following me here). I expect to do my part to keep things interesting.
Indeed. Tonight they started that off with a bang (and we love the two self-promotion links).
The Turkey Blocks monitoring network has detected and confirmed throttling of Twitter and YouTube affecting many internet users in Turkey after a new ISIS propaganda video was shared online just before midnight local time.
The incident was first observed by the Turkey Blocks probe network on fixed broadband operators Uydunet/Turksat and confirmed to also affect mobile providers Turkcell and Vodafone. Turkish internet users independently reported the access issues on domestic social networking sites within minutes of detection, and local media outlets corroborated the extent of the shutdown in the hours that followed. [1, 2]
The blocks each appear to be implemented at the ISP level, with each provider applying its own controls, hence some users may be partly or fully unaffected. While connectivity came back for some users early the next morning, the nationwide slowdowns have continued and were ongoing as of Saturday 24 December 2016.
The video depicting two Turkish soldiers burned alive by so-called Islamic State terrorists in Al-Bab, Syria has raised the ire of many Turks, who are calling for revenge against the militant group. The soldiers killed were reportedly captured a year earlier and held until the time of the filming.
New VPN blocking scheme in effect
Some users reported additional difficulty accessing VPN services to circumvent the ongoing restriction, as providers move to ban VPN and Tor services by government order. Many others were able to use their VPN connections to get online and share their experiences.
The shutdown is the second in a week, with another similar blackout following the assassination of Russia's ambassador to Turkey in what appears to be a rapid escalation in the use of internet controls to restrict the flow of information.
Out of Order When Prosecutors Cross the Line
The year was 1990. George H.W. Bush was president. The song “Hold On” by Wilson Phillips was number one on the Billboard chart. And Charles “Joe” Hynes, celebrated for their role as a special prosecutor in a racially charged case in Howard Beach, began their first term as Brooklyn District Attorney.
Bush's presidency came and went; their son's did too. Wilson Phillips went on a 10-year hiatus; then got back together in 2004.
Hynes, all along the way, has done exactly what that top 1990 ballad instructed: He's held on. He's been Brooklyn's top law man for nearly 24 years, making them one of the longest serving district attorneys in New York City history.
But Hynes's once firm grasp on the position could be imperiled. Buffeted by controversial cases, charges of misconduct in their office, and concerns about possibly preferential treatment for Jewish residents of the borough, Hynes is seen by political strategists to be facing a serious challenge from Kenneth Thompson, an African-American former federal prosecutor. On Tuesday, Sept. 10, voters in the Brooklyn Democratic primary could deny Hynes a chance at a seventh term.
Almost all prosecutors who stay in office for lengthy terms wind up facing a familiar array of complaints – about cases lost, creeping arrogance, political gamesmanship. Robert M. Morgenthau, revered by many across their decades as Manhattan's top prosecutor, had their share of critics and embarrassments, the troubled prosecution of five teenagers for the rape of a woman in Central Park among them.
Some of the complaints about Hynes, then, fit that mold: He's been accused of hiring and firing people based on favoritism and political connections and he's been taken to task for some failed or underwhelming prosecutions. Even their once reliable base of support, the borough's Orthodox Jewish community, has seemed to split, some angered that Hynes has made a series of pedophilia cases against people in their ranks, others disappointed that they were late to the issue and overly lenient in their handling of the cases.
But Thompson, who served in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, has focused their criticism on the question of wrongful convictions and possible misconduct by prosecutors over the years in Hynes's office.
On the campaign trail Thompson, for instance, has cited withering criticism from two federal judges over the way one of Hynes's top prosecutors won a wrongful conviction in a high-profile murder case.
In the last several weeks, Thompson has gained endorsements from the Service Employees International Union, the Citizens Union, and several Brooklyn-based representatives in Congress.
Hynes has defended the work of their office, rejecting any claims that they permit or encourages misconduct. They have campaigned on what they assert are their myriad novel and effective approaches to fighting crime.
Both the district attorney's office and Hynes's campaign did not respond to requests for comment.
Little public polling has been done in the race. Turnout could play a role. And Hynes, whatever their arguable travails, has history on theirs side.
No incumbent district attorney has lost an election in any of New York's boroughs since 1955. A Brooklyn district attorney hasn't been unseated via the vote since 1911.
Here are some issues that may figure into the election's outcome.
Michael Vecchione
Some of Hynes's campaign woes can be traced to the conduct of Michael Vecchione, the head of Hynes's Rackets Bureau. He's a polarizing figure who has drawn heavy criticism for their conduct in and out of the courtroom.
Two federal judges have lambasted Vecchione for withholding evidence and for their handling of several witnesses in a high-profile murder case.
Now the defendant, a Brooklyn man named Jabbar Collins who spent 16 years in prison, is suing the city for millions as part of a far-reaching wrongful conviction lawsuit. Their lawyer, Manhattan-based attorney Joel Rudin, is attempting to make the case that misconduct in Hynes's office is so pervasive that Hynes must have actually condoned it.
Vecchione's career in the district attorney's office spans more than two decades. In 2003, the district attorney's office was forced to vacate the conviction of a man they suspected of being involved in at least three murders when a federal court agreed to hear allegations that Vecchione had withheld evidence in the man's trial.
In 2006, Vecchione tried to prosecute former FBI agent R. Lindley DeVecchio for helping arrange the murders of gangsters on behalf of mob boss Greg Scarpa. Hynes called it “the most stunning example of official corruption [he] had ever seen.” But the case fell apart just days into trial when it became clear that Vecchione's chief witness was unstable and had given false testimony.
More recently, The New York Post reported that Vecchione instructed staff not to preserve exculpatory evidence in sex-trafficking cases during a training session in 2012.
Vecchione has denied all charges of misconduct, and they testified under oath that they did not remember the details of what took place at the training session for sex-trafficking cases in 2012.
Hynes has staunchly defended Vecchione, who continues to be one of the highest-paid prosecutors in the office. Earlier this year, Hynes allowed Vecchione to be a featured character in a CBS television show called Brooklyn DA.
ProPublica in 2013 has published a series of articles investigating prosecutorial misconduct and the lack of consequences for prosecutors who commit serious violations of the law. Vecchione was the subject of one of those articles.
Hynes's office did not respond to ProPublica's request for comment on Vecchione's history and its possible impact on Hynes's re-election effort.
50 Possibly Troubled Cases
Last spring, Hynes asked a judge to vacate the conviction of a man their office had mistakenly prosecuted for the murder of a Brooklyn rabbi. Hynes blamed a detective in the case for the wrongful conviction, and ordered their office to review 50 cases involving the detective.
The investigation has obvious implications for the now-retired detective, Louis Scarcella, who has publicly denied they ever did anything wrong. But Hynes's prosecutors had vouched for the detective's work in the cases, using the confessions they had allegedly won or the evidence they had produced to send people to prisons. Two of the prosecutors involved in Scarcella cases have gone on to work as New York State judges; four are now senior officials in the district attorney's office.
Thompson and other critics of Hynes pounced when it became clear that a 12-member panel of lawyers and judges appointed by Hynes to oversee the review of the 50 cases included three people who had donated to Hynes's campaign.
Hynes has said they are convinced of the panel's independence, and that the investigation will go where the evidence takes it.
The New York Times reported Friday that its examination of some of Scarcella's cases showed that prosecutors either ignored warning signs or made missteps of their own.
Hynes told the Times that the investigation so far had not turned up evidence that would require revisiting the propriety of a conviction. But they did not address the paper's findings about the conduct of their prosecutors.
Detaining Witnesses
Hynes's training procedures and office policies have also come under fire.
A Brooklyn man seeking to have their murder conviction overturned has accused Hynes's office of holding a witness against their will until they agreed to testify as prosecutors wanted in the case.
That case, which is now before a federal judge, has fueled an effort by Jabbar Collins's lawyer to establish that Hynes's office routinely detained and coerced witnesses in violation of the law. The accusation, made as part of Collins's lawsuit against Hynes and the city, deals with a powerful legal tool called the material witness order. The orders are supposed to be used only under rare circumstances, usually when prosecutors fear a potential witness might flee instead of testifying in court.
New York law requires that prosecutors bring any material witness straight to court.
But Collins's lawyer, along with several other defense lawyers are seeking to hold prosecutors accountable for abusing the orders, alleging that witnesses were never brought before a judge or provided with a lawyer, as the law requires.
Hynes has denied allegations that their prosecutors failed to abide by the law in their handling of witnesses.
Favoritism
Hynes's hiring and firing decisions have also proven fodder during the campaign, and Thompson has seized on them.
The New York Post reported this summer that Mark Posner, a lawyer in the office's powerful Rackets Bureau, was caught using their office phone to call prostitutes. The Post article said Posner was found out by their own colleagues, who were investigating a local prostitution ring.
Posner is the son of a longtime ally of Hynes, Charles Posner. The elder Posner had served as Hynes's liaison to Brooklyn's Orthodox Jewish community, and Hynes had later recommended them for a judgeship. Posner, who died in 2004, served as a State Supreme Court justice for nearly a decade.
Hynes did not fire Mark Posner after learning of their misconduct. Instead, they suspended them for 10 days and transferred them to the Early Case Assessment Bureau, a low-level desk where prosecutors analyze arrests and make judgments on what charges to pursue.
At the time Posner was caught, Brooklyn DA spokesperson Jerry Schmetterer told the Post that Hynes acted as soon as they learned of Posner's conduct by suspending him, ordering them to seek counseling, and demoting him.
Posner didn't immediately respond to a voice message left at their home. And neither Hynes's office nor their campaign responded to questions from ProPublica.
In January 2012, Hynes hired a woman named Angel DiPietro to become an assistant district attorney. It was a hire with a backstory.
Eight years earlier, DiPietro was a witness in the murder case of Mark Fisher, a Fairfield University student-athlete in Prospect Park South. They were with Fisher and friends in Brooklyn the night they were killed. At the time, a spokesperson for the police department told the New York Times that DiPietro demonstrated “a lack of full-hearted cooperation.” Police Commissioner Ray Kelly themselves described DiPietro and seven of their other friends as “uncooperative.”
Eventually DiPietro testified at trial and two people they were with that night were found guilty of the murder.
DiPietro's father, a defense attorney in Brooklyn, had been a regular contributor to Hynes's political campaigns, and in the months after DiPietro was hired, they donated another $3,000 to Hynes's 2013 political campaign.
DiPietro, contacted by telephone, referred ProPublica to the spokesperson for the district attorney's office. The spokesperson did not respond to request for comment.
James DiPietro, Angel's father, did agree to an interview.
“I wish I could've given them more,” DiPietro's father said of their donations to Hynes. They said that their daughter was first offered the job in 2010 and fully deserved it on their own merits. And they asserted that their daughter had in fact cooperated fully in the Fisher murder investigation.
Selective Prosecutions
In 1996 Hynes indicted a Brooklyn political gadfly named John O'Hara. The charge was modest: voting from their girlfriend's apartment, which was outside of their own election district. After three separate trials, O'Hara was found guilty, lost their law license, and was sentenced to community service.
O'Hara has always claimed that Hynes went after them because he'd run for city council and assembly seats against some of Hynes's allies.
Thirteen years later, in 2009, a grievance committee bolstered O'Hara's account. It restored their license, saying there were “grave doubts that Mr. O'Hara did anything that justified their criminal prosecution.”
In 2012, The New York Times ran a stinging series of articles on how Hynes's office for years handled investigations of accused sexual predators in the Orthodox Jewish communities. The series established that Hynes had allowed many of the accusations to be handled by rabbinical courts rather than prosecuting the cases himself.
Hynes initially defended the way they handled the sex abuse cases, but eventually pledged reforms and began prosecuting them with more vigor.
RICHMOND — The Virginia Senate on Monday voted to repeal the state's nearly 20-year-old law limiting handgun purchases to one per month, delivering a long-sought victory to advocates of gun rights and the Second Amendment.
The legislation, signed by Gov. L. Douglas Wilder in 1993, was intended to curb illegal gun trafficking from Virginia to other states on the East Coast, notably New York. That point was reiterated Monday by those looking to keep the ban in place.
“Virginians must look out for our neighbors,” said Sen. David W. Marsden, Fairfax Democrat. “Twenty years ago, the majority of homicides in New York were committed with guns bought in Virginia. People would buy a bunch of guns in Virginia and take them to New York to sell.”
Proponents say there are many exemptions in the law — for law-enforcement officials and holders of concealed-weapon permits, for example — and that gun-tracking technology has come so far that the law is no longer necessary.
“This law may have had a purpose when it was passed originally, but the rationale has been neutered by the exceptions that now exist,” said Delegate L. Scott Lingamfelter, Prince William Republican, who sponsored the bill in the House of Delegates.
Philip Van Cleave, president of the pro-gun Virginia Citizens Defense League, sent an email to supporters shortly after the vote declaring that “the albatross is almost dead.”
The House signed off on its version of the bill last week, and Gov. Bob McDonnell has indicated that they will sign the measure.
Mr. McDonnell supported the law when they were a Republican delegate representing Virginia Beach, but, citing technological progress since then, now backs its repeal.
The measure passed by a vote of 21-19, sparing Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling from having to cast a tie-breaking vote on the contentious issue. Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr., James City Republican, joined 18 Democrats in voting against the bill. Sen. R. Creigh Deeds of Bath and Sen. John S. Edwards of Roanoke, pro-gun Democrats who represent rural areas of the state, were the two crossovers who voted for the repeal.
Gun control advocates quickly expressed their disappointment.
“Virginia has had more than its share of horrific tragedies perpetrated by criminals with easy access to firearms,” said Lori Haas, whose daughter, Emily, survived the 2007 tragedy at Virginia Tech in which Seung-hui Cho killed 32 people before taking their own life. “It is a sad day when our legislators purposely make it easier for gun traffickers to do their dirty business.”
Senate Democratic Leader Richard L. Saslaw of Fairfax noted that if a person bought one gun a month, every month, for the past 20 years, they would have amassed a cache of 240 handguns.
“If you need more than 240 handguns, I submit something's wrong with you,” they said. “Something has gone terribly wrong in your life.”
The Senate has also signed off on a bill that would remove the option for a locality to require that an applicant for a concealed handgun permit submit fingerprints as part of their application.
While Monday's vote marked a gigantic victory for groups such as the Virginia Citizens Defense League and the National Rifle Association, the pro-gun lobby has not been entirely successful thus far in the 2012 session.
Sen. Charles W. Carrico Sr., Grayson Republican and patron of the one-gun-a-month measure, requested that another bill to pre-empt any administrative body from enacting gun-control regulations be carried over to next year.
The Courts of Justice Committee also continued to next year a bill introduced by Sen. Richard H. Black, Loudoun Republican, that would eliminate a state background check for purchasers of rifles and shotguns in favor of a federal one. Currently, both are used.

They're called kringles, the pride of Racine, Wisconsin. If you're unfamiliar with these tasty treats, don't worry: Vinita Nair has a tale that's short and sweet:
"When you come into Racine," said Eric Olesen, "one of the first things people ask you is, 'Have you had a kringle yet?'"
CBS News
In Racine, rthge holidays are all about the kringles. There's a certain skill involved in making Wisconsin's state pastry.
It takes lots of butter to make the dough flaky, then you have to layer it -- again, and again, and again -- to make the 36 layers.
For four generations, Bendtsen's Bakery, in Racine, Wisconsin, has been mastering the technique.
"Does everybody do this much by hand?" asked Nair.
"As far as I know now, nobody at all does," replied Ben Bendtsen. "I think we're the last ones."
Ben Bendtsen, of Bendtsen's Bakery. CBS News
When the Bendtsen family opened its bakery 81 years ago, they followed the Danish tradition of a pretzel-shaped pastry. Its popularity quickly earned Racine the nickname Kringleville, complete with a Kringle Queen and a kringle-inspired polka.
Originally, the pastry had an almond filling with raisins. Now, Ben Jr., and their son, Ben III, make close to 30 flavors, including almond, apple, apricot, blueberry, cherry, raspberry and pecan.
To save time, the pretzel shape became an oval, but everything else has stayed the same.
"My grandpa until they died would come here and he'd say, 'You just keep the quality, you'll be here forever,'" said Ben Jr. "And, well, I'm still here"
Not far from Bendtsen's is O & H Danish Bakery, family-run since 1949.
Owner Eric Olesen took Nair on a tour of their 39,000-square-foot facility, where machines have mastered the delicate layers and folds. Daily, they make 5,000-7,000 kringles. And during the holidays, they've shipped up to 20,000 in one day.
Helsinki, Finland Oleksiy Mark/Shutterstock LONDON — Finland's experiment with a universal basic income is unworkable and unaffordable, according to the country's biggest trade union.
Since January, Finland's government has paid a group of 2,000 unemployed Finns aged between 25 and 58 with a monthly stipend of £480 ($600), as it considers a radical new welfare system.
"We think it takes social policy in the wrong direction," Ilkka Kaukoranta, chief economist of trade union group SAK told Bloomberg. The group has one million members in a country of 5.4 million people.
Advocates say rolling out the system would provide a vital safety net for all citizens and remove inefficient benefit systems currently in place, but the SAK objects to a basic income on two principal grounds:
1. Kaukoranta said it would be "impossibly expensive" to roll out "since it would increase the government deficit by about 5%" of GDP.
2. The group believes that UBI would remove the incentive for citizens to work and would shrink the labour force by encouraging people to take more time off, as well as making less attractive jobs easier to refuse.
Advocates of the scheme disagree on both points, including Guy Standing, a leading economist and vocal supporter of a UBI. They believe that the current system of means-tested benefits in many European countries disincentives work, because the withdrawal of benefits that comes with entering low-paid work causes there to be little increase in a worker's overall income.
They told BI in January: "If you had a basic income, it would mean that everybody would have a base, on top of which their earned income would be taxed at the standard rate of tax. That would increase the incentive to take low-wage jobs. The claims that it would act as a disincentive is the actual opposite."
They also believe a UBI could be funded through a combination of sovereign wealth funds, hiked taxes, and funnelling money from existing welfare schemes.
Whether or not the scheme is a success is a long way off: the pilot runs until December 2018.
Twenty state attorneys general filed a lawsuit on Thursday against several pharmaceutical companies, accusing them of entering into "numerous illegal conspiracies" to fix generic drug prices at consumers' expense.
The federal lawsuit (pdf) names generic drug-makers Heritage Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc., Citron Pharma, LLC, Mayne Pharma (USA), Inc., Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., and concerns two drugs: doxycycline hyclate delayed release, an antibiotic used to treat a range of conditions including respiratory tract infections, and glyburide, an oral diabetes medication.
It was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut and labels Heritage as the "principal architect and ringleader" that helped organize a "wide-ranging series of conspiracies" to fix prices.
"The misconduct was conceived and carried out by senior drug company executives and their subordinate marketing and sales executives."
George Jepsen, Connecticut Attorney General
"My office has dedicated significant resources to this investigation for more than two years and has developed compelling evidence of collusion and anticompetitive conduct across many companies that manufacture and market generic drugs in the United States," said Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen, who is leading the coalition.
The other plaintiff states are Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington.
"While the principal architect of the conspiracies addressed in this lawsuit was Heritage Pharmaceuticals, we have evidence of widespread participation in illegal conspiracies across the generic drug industry," Jepsen said. "Ultimately, it was consumers—and, indeed, our healthcare system as a whole—who paid for these actions through artificially high prices for generic drugs."
A release from Jepsen's office says "the misconduct was conceived and carried out by senior drug company executives and their subordinate marketing and sales executives," who "coordinated their schemes through direct interaction with their competitors at industry trade shows, customer conferences, and other events, as well as through direct email, phone, and text message communications."

"While generic competition is supposed to bring prices down, these companies secretly agreed to rig the system to drive prices up at the expense of patients," Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson said in a statement. They said a salesperson for Heritage in Minnesota played a key role in the scheme by organizing dinners among employees of competing drug companies when they visited the state. "The dinners and meetings led to the exchange of information about the competitors' business plans and ultimately led to agreements on setting prices and/or allocating the market so as to avoid competing on price," a statement from Swanson's office said.
The news comes just one day after it was revealed that the U.S. Department of Justice has charged two former Heritage executives with conspiring to fix generic prices—"the first fruits of an ongoing and sweeping investigation into generic drug price-fixing by the Department," according to Ars Technica.
As Bloomberg reported, guilty pleas and cooperation from the two executives "could lead to charges against executives at other drugmakers."
Forbes predicts "[t]he antitrust lawsuit and federal investigation will likely bring further political heat to the generic drug sector."
Indeed, the lawsuit charges: "Over the last several years, however, [the] price dynamic has changed for a large number of generic drugs. Prices for dozens of generic drugs have uncharacteristically risen—some have skyrocketed—for no apparent reason, sparking outrage from public officials, payers, and consumers across the country whose costs have doubled, tripled, or in some cases increased up to 1,000 percent or more."
A one-night stand has turned into one big problem for Wiz Khalifa. The Taylor Gang rapper had sex with a Playboy model, and it was all being taped without their knowledge.
On Thursday morning, the newly-single Wiz posted photos on Instagram showing them getting intimate with a topless Carla Howe, who appeared in their 2012 movie Mac & Devin Go to High School.
The two slept together, and it was all caught on camera. According to TMZ, their sexual escapades were recorded, but Wiz had no idea.
The footage is now being shopped around Hollywood with the hopes of scoring the next big celebrity sex tape.
Wiz was unaware that they were being taped and if anyone tries to release the video, they are prepared to have their lawyers block it. He's already deleted their pics, but they remain on Carla's Instagram account.
Wiz has been living young, wild, and free since splitting from their wife Amber Rose in September. While he's still legally married, they are rumored to be dating video vixen Deelishis and even posted a naked picture of themselves in the shower.
Late Friday night, Republicans released a 479-page amendment to their tax bill. Republican leaders are planning to vote on the bill on Friday or early Saturday morning, and it is expected to pass.
Maybe someone should read it first.
Tucked away on page 289 is a provision that would exempt certain colleges from a special tax on university endowments. It would only apply to colleges that: 1. Did not accept federal funds, and 2. Had an endowment of at least $500,000 per student.
There appears to be only one educational institution in the entire country that would benefit: Hillsdale College.
What's so special about Hillsdale?
The school has deep ties to Betsy DeVos, Trump's education secretary, and their family. The DeVos clan founded Amway, which made them billionaires, and are large Republican donors. The Hillsdale student paper details the connections.
Betsy DeVos' brother is Erik Prince, a 1992 graduate of Hillsdale College and the founder of the controversial private security firm Blackwater Worldwide, now named Academi. In 2009, the DeVos family also founded ArtPrize, an international art competition that featured the work of five art professors and students this year. Most notably, Richard DeVos, Betsy DeVos' father-in-law, co-founded Amway with Jay Van Andel. Van Andel's son, Steve, was a 1978 graduate of Hillsdale and currently serves as the chairperson of Amway. In 2013, after they donated to graduate school scholarships and operations, Hillsdale named it's graduate school of statesmanship in their honor.
Another big supporter of Hillsdale are the Kochs, another family of Republican billionaires.
The provision was supported by the conservative Heritage Foundation. Larry Arnn, Hillsdale's president, has served on Heritage's board for 15 years. Hillsdale embraces a far-right ideology and regularly advertises on the Rush Limbaugh show.
Hillsdale College has an endowment of about $548 million, which means under the Senate bill it would not yet have to pay the excise tax regardless because it is less than $500,000 per student. The House version of the bill, however, sets the threshold at $250,000. So the provision provides important protections for Hillsdale as its endowment grows or if the House threshold is adopted in the final bill.
Hillsdale was concerned about the provision and was publicly making the case that it should be exempt because it does not accept federal funds.
Why does Hillsdale reject federal funds? For one thing, it allows them to ignore “federal regulations governing how to respond to sexual assault and banning discrimination based on sexual orientation.” (Notably, these are the same kind of regulations Betsy DeVos is seeking to undermine as education secretary.)
The campus chaplain at Hillsdale once sent an all-school email calling for prayer against the “evil” of same-sex marriage. The president of the college, Arnn, referred to minority students as “dark ones” in a state legislative hearing.
The Hillsdale provision was subject to withering criticism from Senate Democrats as the final vote neared on Friday.
“One college, Hillsdale College, has been exempted from taxes on colleges with large endowments. It is supported by the DeVos family. This is a metaphor for how high the stench is rising in this chamber,” Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said.
UPDATE: This provision was stripped out via a Democratic amendment prior to final passage early Saturday morning.
Perhaps the worst place for a shooting to break out is in the middle of a bunch of people with guns, who are flanked by police who have bigger guns and are already expecting trouble.
That is one of the scenarios regarding what happened at the Twin Peaks in Waco during a May melee that left at least nine bikers dead, about two dozen wounded, and 177 charged with engaging in organized crime.
Ballistics reports recently leaked to the Associated Press conclude that four of the dead were shot by rifle rounds that would be fired from the weapons carried by police. In the days after the shooting, there was a rumor that four had been killed by police, but as far as public proof went, it was a mystery.
There was no love lost between members of the Bandidos and Cossacks motorcycle clubs, and each of their supporters, as they came face to face in the parking lot outside the Twin Peaks restaurant.
By all accounts, a large percentage had guns, knives or other weapons either on them or in their motorcycles, cars or trucks. A number of the bikers also had permits to carry their guns, and some were veterans who had first-hand experience in receiving fire.
As a fight of words quickly lead to at least one biker drew their handgun and fired it into another, and a whole bunch of other people pulled out their weapons to either defend themselves, go on the attack, or just try and stay safe while figuring out what was going on.
Making matters more complicated, the Cossacks and the Bandidos already had a few violent clashes, but they were usually fist fights and never gun fights.
Police may have faced a situation where they were unsure who was waving a gun as they intended to fire at others, versus who were just trying to defend themselves.
Terry Katz, a spokesperson for the International Outlaw Motorcycle Gang Investigators Association, compared what happened in Waco to what might happen if a gunman attacked a restaurant and people fearing for their own safety pulled out their own guns.
“You get there quickly, and it is an active shooter situation,” they said of what police would confront. “There are shots fired, bullets whizzing near you.”
“As to who got shot and how many people were shot by whom,” they said, “it is going to come out.”
Some critics have said that instead of having Special Weapons and Tactics officers lying low in the area before the bikers arrived, officers could have kept a high profile and stopped the trouble before it started.
The Waco Police and McLennan County Sheriff's Office have repeatedly declined to publicly discuss specifics of the case _ following the first few days of news conferences _ saying they are are bound by a court-issued gag order.
Square Enix have announced that Final Fantasy games are not the only titles to be receiving cross-over DLC content within the realm of Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII. The publisher who are set to release the final installment in the “FF XIII” trilogy have just confirmed that a Tomb Raider costume DLC set will be available at launch for the game on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox360 video game consoles.
The DLC content will feature the gear that Lara Croft wears in the 2013 release of Tomb Raider and subsequent Definitive Edition release, in addition to the exclusive Survivor's Axe and Riot Shield to help Lightning in battle. Oddly enough they have not mentioned if this set will be paid or free – my guess is the former.
Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII is set for release in North America next Tuesday, with a PAL region release to be available a few days later.
(CNET) -- Google Wave and Google Buzz may have had troubles attracting usage, but the new ability to place calls from Gmail appears to have caught on quickly.
"Over 1,000,000 calls placed from Gmail in just 24 hours!" Google tweeted Thursday, evidently pleased with the number.
For comparison, there are somewhat more than 300 million people in the United States. If the average person makes 10 calls per day--research in 2008 put the number at 208 calls per month--that means about one out of every 3,000 calls in the U.S. went through the service on its first day.
The service lets Gmail users make free calls to U.S. and Canada and inexpensive calls to phones in other countries. It uses Gmail as an interface and optionally can integrate with Google Voice to receive calls as well.
To be sure, a lot of calls are placed daily in the United States, where the new Gmail feature was activated initially. But the figure indicates that a sizable number of the millions of Gmail users at least gave it a whirl even if they didn't decide it was time to stop paying for their other phones.
I had two successes with the service the day it launched, both unplanned. First, somebody called my mobile phone and my computer "rang" as well. I had the pleasure of conducting an interview via headphones and my computer's microphone rather than trying to squeeze my mobile phone between my shoulder and ear for an hour.
I've done plenty of interviews over Skype, but this time the call came in from the phone system without my having to get somebody to sign up for Skype or for me to pay for a SkypeIn phone number.
Second, I came back to my desk to see a missed call announced on my Gmail screen. I clicked the phone number to call back and had a quick chat through my computer. Nothing fancy, but no mobile phone minutes were consumed in this process, and I didn't have to tell anybody anything except my Google Voice phone number.
Given the vast number of phone calls made daily, I'm reluctant to draw any grand conclusions. But the fact is that I used the service twice yesterday without actively seeking to do so (granted, I already signed up for Google Voice and installed the required chat plug-in).
That indicates to me that it's a matter those in the voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) realm or more traditional telephony will need to take seriously.

On opening night vs. the Anaheim Ducks, Steve Downie jumped in to let Ryan Kesler know they were on the ice after Kesler hit Letang hard, and Kesler seemed to disappear for the rest of the game.
Last night against the Islanders, Downie may have endeared themselves to many more fans. Late in the 2nd period, Sidney Crosby got tangled up behind the net with Jaroslav Halak. After the buzzer to end the period, Halak and Crosby were both talking with the officials and chirping each other a bit. Travis Hamonic decided to step in and have some words for Crosby, and thats when Steve Downie decided to let Hamonic know they were there.
Steve Downie Pointing at Travis Hamonic dot GIF forward slash loop forever and ever.
Downie didn't do anything stupid here, or take any extra penalties. They took enough of those during play, but as Mike Johnston noted after the game to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Seth Rorabaugh, the Penguins can kill penalties that are a result of Downie playing physical.
This is absolutely not the first time in a game between the Penguins and Islanders that Travis Hamonic needed settled down, and Downie did a fine job at it.
In the 3rd period, Frans Nielsen went into the corner with their head down, and was hit hard by Downie.
You have to keep your head up.
Hamonic took exception to it, and dropped the gloves with Downie. I don't want to see anyone get hurt, but going into the corner with your head down is irresponsible, and I'm happy to see that Nielsen wasn't injured on the play.
I loved how Downie came out of the hit knowing there would be a response and was ready to protect themselves in what seemed like fractions of a second.
Downie was given a penalty for charging, which is fair, as well as the matching fighting penalties for both they and Hamonic. Hamonic also received a 10-minute misconduct, and a penalty for instigating. When Downie can get a Top-4 defenseman to take a misconduct penalty, that's a trade-off that Penguins fans should be willing to take all the time.
What we've seen through 4 games is that Downie plays along the edge. Keeping them reined in and not tiptoeing too far over that line will be key, and what many said that Rick Tocchet would be able to do when Downie was brought in this summer.

Alejandro Inarritu has won the top prize at the Directors Guild of America (DGA) awards for The Revenant, adding weight to their chances at the Oscars.
The Revenant, starring Leonardo Di Caprio as a frontiersman fighting for survival, leads the Oscars race with 12 nominations, including the best director.
Past DGA award winners have often gone on to claim the best director Oscar and the best film category.
Inarritu won the DGA award for Birdman in 2015 and then won the Oscars double.
The DGA is the industry's leading group of film and TV directors and its opinion carries a lot of weight.
To date, there have been only seven occasions when the DGA winner has not then won the subsequent Academy Award.
The group also chose Matthew Heineman as best documentary maker for Cartel Land.
Heineman's film focuses on vigilante groups fighting drug cartels on both sides of the US/Mexican border.
Heineman said: "I hope that this film will give voice to those trapped by the cycle of violence in hopes that one day the cycle will end."
Open race
For Inarritu, Saturday night's accolade makes the Mexican the first director to win back-to-back DGA awards.

They were noticeably moved when picking up their trophy at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles.
They first acknowledged their father, who died two years ago, saying: "I think he's getting some business up there to make this happen and I miss them a lot."
They went on to add: "This hug, this embrace you're giving to me today is going to a whole country, a whole Latin American community in this country.
"The people who live here contribute a lot to this country."
Inarritu has already won the Golden Globe for best director for the Revenant and they are nominated for the directing Bafta.
But despite The Revenant's leading position in the Oscars race, this year the DGA award was considered hard to call as each of the leading industry guilds has championed a different film.
The Producers Guild of America gave its top prize to The Big Short and the Screen Actors Guild award for best ensemble went to Spotlight.
Also at the DGA awards, a new prize was presented this year for first-time feature film director. It was won by Alex Garland for their Oscar-nominated sci-fi film Ex Machina.
In addition to film directors, the DGA also honoured those working in television. David Nutter won the award for a TV drama series for their international fantasy hit Game of Thrones.
Chris Addison won for best TV comedy direction for the political comedy series Veep.
The debate over diversity in Hollywood was on the agenda too at the awards ceremony with the guild's president bringing it up in their welcome speech.
Paris Barclay said it was important to convince "the industry that equal opportunity means just that".
"Equal opportunity means a level playing field," they added.
Anti-Malarial Drug Mefloquine Associated With 87 Deaths and Hundreds of Psychotic Episodes in Past 15 Years
Was Staff Sergeant Robert Bales Administered the Drug?
(Washington, DC) — Judicial Watch, the public interest group that that investigates and fights government corruption, announced today that it has uncovered documents from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) detailing more than 2,000 episodes during the past 15 years in which people had serious adverse reactions caused by the anti-malaria drug, mefloquine hydrochloride, commonly known as Lariam®. Of 87 reported deaths associated with the drug, 39 were recorded as suicides and 12 were homicides.
The documents obtained by Judicial Watch pursuant to a March 26, 2012, request submitted to the FDA, include details from the agency's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) identifying persons treated with mefloquine from November 4, 1997, through March 28, 2012, and the specific reported reactions to the drug. In addition to the reported deaths, reported reactions included hallucinations, panic attacks, depression, paranoia, anxiety, confusion, mental disorder, delusion, hemorrhaging, and numerous other serious disorders.
Long known for its severe neurological side effects, mefloquine was supposedly removed as the drug of choice in the treatment of malaria by the Department of Defense (DOD). In a September 2009 policy memorandum, the Defense Department stated that mefloquine was to be prescribed only in limited cases where other drugs, such as doxycycline and mallarone, were considered unlikely to be effective. Mefloquine was specifically prohibited in the treatment of patients with head injuries, and in particular, a TBI (traumatic brain injury). It is also contraindicated for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder.
Nonetheless, the documents obtained by Judicial Watch indicate clearly that mefloquine is still prescribed, even though its use has decreased since the September 2009 memorandum limiting its use was issued. In the field, medics apparently do not necessarily need to follow such policy recommendations by the U.S. Army and U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM).
Given the serious side effects of the drug and the psychotic and aggressive change that can occur in the personality of patients being treated with mefloquine, questions have been raised as to whether or not Staff Sergeant Robert Bales was given the drug prior to theirs allegedly attacking and murdering 17 Afghan civilians during the night of March 11, 2012.
To date, the DOD has neither confirmed nor denied that Sergeant Bates took mefloquine, citing medical privacy concerns. Their attorney, John Henry Browne, told CNN that they “would not be surprised” if Bales took it. According to The Huffington Post: “The Pentagon is in the midst of a widespread review of the military's use of a notorious anti-malaria drug after finding out that the pills have been wrongly given to soldiers with preexisting problems, including brain injuries such as the one sustained by the U.S. soldier who allegedly massacred 17 civilians in Afghanistan…[T]he initial review was ordered in January. After the massacre, on March 20, one part of the Army issued an urgent call to complete the Jan. 17 request from Woodson within six days.”
Bales reportedly suffered a traumatic brain injury in Iraq in 2010. If so, then Defense Department policy would have prohibited administration of the drug to Bales.
“Obviously, the Department of Defense has been lax in policing the use of this dangerous drug in the treatment of service men and women,” said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch. “Given the seriousness of the side effects documented in these reports, the Pentagon should quickly consider halting the drug's distribution to our troops.”
A bomb ripped through the governor's temporary headquarters in Yemen's main southern city of Aden on Thursday, killing four people and injuring 10 others, security officials and medics said.
Governor Nayef al-Bakri was unharmed in the blast at the headquarters of the Aden Faculty of Administrative Sciences, which is housing the governor's offices, the sources told AFP.
It was the first such attack in Aden since pro-government forces retook the city from Houthi militias in mid-July.
The authorities could not immediately identify the perpetrators, the security officials said.
Bakri is known for their close ties to the al-Islah Party, seen as the country's branch of the Muslim Brotherhood.
They were a deputy governor of Aden until the Houthis advanced on the city in March after seizing the capital Sanaa.
Exiled President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi later appointed them governor, rewarding them for remaining in the city during months of fierce fighting while many other provincial officials fled.
The recapture of Aden by loyalist forces supported by Saudi-led air strikes was a turning point in the conflict, paving the way for their advance across the south, although the Houthis still hold Sanaa.
After a string of victories, Yemeni government spokesperson, Rajeh Badi, on Tuesday said that most provinces had been freed from the Houthis and that the anti-Houthi forces would now be looking to take back the cites of Sanaa, Amran and Saada, the capital of the Houthi northern heartland.
"We call on the Houthis to understand the lesson after their defeat in most of Yemen's cities," they told Anadolu Agency speaking from Doha, Qatar.
"We urge them to implement UN Security Council resolution 2216," they said, adding that "any solution outside the Security Council resolution is completely unacceptable".
On 14 April, UNSC Resolution 2216 - which was drafted by members of a Saudi-led anti-Houthi coalition and submitted by Jordan - was endorsed by 14 countries at the United Nations Security Council.
The resolution called on Houthi forces to “immediately and unconditionally” end all violence, retreat from all areas of Yemen captured previously, return military equipment seized earlier and release all political detainees and child soldiers.
"We are seeking to liberate the whole of Yemen from the Houthis, not only Sanaa but also Amran and Saada… Sanaa is the political capital and the capital of all Yemenis."
The spokesperson denied that the Houthi withdrawal from the south was "tactical," as they have claimed.
"This is not true, what is happening is a victory for the resistance and for the national army, it is also a large collapse for the Houthi militias and the pro-Saleh forces,” they added in reference to forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh who has fought in alliance with the Houthis.
Action Bronson has been taken off the bill for George Washington University's Spring Fling, taking place this Saturday, April 2, XXL reports. The rapper's set was cancelled following an outpouring of student complaints claiming that the rapper's lyrics are misogynist, transphobic, and insensitive to sexual assault survivors. "The Program Board has decided to remove Action Bronson from Saturday's setlist," university representatives said in a statement. "We apologize to the GW community for causing distress over the past few days and for attempting to bring an artist who is not consistent with our values of diversity and inclusion.” GoldLink will headline the concert instead. Update 6:20 p.m.: Action Bronson has written an open letter to GWU students and the public. Read it belo**w. Update 8:37 p.m.: Another student group at GWU has started a petition to reinstate Action Bronson at Spring Fling. Read a student's Facebook post supporting Bronson's right to "free expression" here.
On Tuesday, The GW Hatchet published an editorial by opinions editor Sarah Blugis calling for the rapper's removal, referring to them as "a blatant misogynist" with "a history of transphobia." They cited Bronson's controversial 2011 song "Consensual Rape," as well as their "Brunch" video—a clip released the same year that depicts the rapper cooking next to a dead woman, dragging their body into their car, and stabbing them while calling them a "bitch"—as evidence of them claims.
A student petition requesting their withdrawal for similar reasons, meanwhile, has received over 349 signatures so far. On Monday, the university's program board said that they had "received assurances from Mr. Bronson's team that it ["Consensual Rape"] [would] not be performed at Spring Fling."
The cancelled Spring Fling set follows Bronson's removal from a NXNE festival showcase in Toronto last June. Following the public outcry, Bronson distanced themselves from the controversial material in a series of tweets that they later deleted. They then backtracked, declaring "FUCK ALL YALL HATERS BLOW DICK."
Here's the George Washington University Program Board's complete statement:
The Program Board has decided to remove Action Bronson from Saturday's setlist. We apologize to the GW community for causing distress over the past few days and for attempting to bring an artist who is not consistent with our values of diversity and inclusion. Spring Fling is intended to be an event for all students to enjoy and including Action Bronson in the day would go against this. GoldLink will headline Spring Fling this year, and we are looking to fill the remaining time with a local act alongside Lean Quatifah. We have learned important lessons from our mistakes in this situation and are eager to grow as an organization so that we can continue to offer the student body fun and welcoming concerts in the future. We have already begun discussions to ensure that the Program Board will have a more structured and formal system to screen artists and will work to incorporate a greater level of student input so that in the future we invite only those who live up to GW's values. We hope to see everyone on Saturday.
Update 6:20 p.m.: Action Bronson has released the following statement:
Researchers have found that Zika virus can live in eyes and have identified genetic material from the virus in tears, according to a study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. The study, in mice, helps explain why some Zika patients develop eye disease including a condition known as uveitis which can lead to permanent vision loss.
The study, published Sept. 6 in Cell Reports, describes the effect of Zika virus infection in the eyes of mouse fetuses, newborns and adults. The researchers now are planning complementary studies in human patients infected with the virus.
"Our study suggests that the eye could be a reservoir for Zika virus," said Michael S. Diamond, MD, PhD, the Herbert S. Gasser Professor of Medicine and one of the study's senior authors. "We need to consider whether people with Zika have infectious virus in their eyes and how long it actually persists."
Zika virus causes mild disease in most adults but can cause brain damage and death in fetuses. About a third of all babies infected in utero with Zika show eye disease such as inflammation of the optic nerve, retinal damage or blindness after birth. In adults, Zika can cause conjunctivitis -- redness and itchiness of the eyes -- and, in rare cases, uveitis.
To determine what effect Zika infection has on the eye, the researchers infected adult mice under the skin -- similar to the way humans are infected by mosquitoes -- and found live virus in the eyes seven days later. These observations confirm that Zika is able to travel to the eye. It is not yet known whether the virus typically makes that trip by crossing the blood-retina barrier that separates the eye from the bloodstream, traveling along the optic nerve that connects the brain and the eye, or some other route.
Eye infection raises the possibility that people could acquire Zika infection through contact with tears from infected people. The researchers found that the tears of infected mice contained Zika's RNA -- the genetic material from the virus -- but not infectious virus when tested 28 days after infection.
"Even though we didn't find live virus in mouse tears, that doesn't mean that it couldn't be infectious in humans," said Jonathan J. Miner, MD, PhD, an instructor in medicine and the study's lead author. "There could be a window of time when tears are highly infectious and people are coming in contact with it and able to spread it."
The eye is an immune privileged site, meaning the immune system is less active there, to avoid accidentally damaging sensitive tissues responsible for vision in the process of fighting infection. Consequently, infections sometimes persist in the eye after they have been cleared from the rest of the body.
"We are planning studies in people to find out whether infectious virus persists in the cornea or other compartments of the eye, because that would have implications for corneal transplantation," said Rajendra S. Apte, MD, PhD, the Paul A. Cibis Distinguished Professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, and the study's other senior author. Other blood-borne viruses such as herpes simplex virus have been transmitted accidentally through corneal transplants.
Zika researchers are increasingly considering alternative routes of transmission because the virus is spreading more quickly than would be expected by mosquito-borne transmission alone. Epidemiologists can predict the spread of a disease based on known rates of transmission for related viruses and the viral level in the bloodstreams of infected people. By those calculations, Zika is moving unusually fast.
"The Zika epidemic has been very explosive, more explosive than we can account for by just mosquitoes and the level of Zika virus in human blood. Some other factor may be at play," said Diamond, who is also a professor of molecular microbiology, and of pathology and immunology. "Sexual transmission is probably not playing a major role, but it could be some other bodily fluid -- saliva, or urine or tears."
Even if human tears do not turn out to be infectious, the researchers' detection of live virus in the eye and viral RNA in tears still has practical benefits. Human tears potentially could be tested for viral RNA or antibodies, a less painful way to diagnose recent Zika infection than drawing blood. The mouse eye could be used to test anti-Zika drugs.
"The advantage to using the eye is that your dosing requirements are very small, and you don't have to worry as much about effects of larger dosages of therapeutic agents on the rest of the body such as liver toxicity," said Apte, who is also a professor of developmental biology and of medicine. "If you know you have virus replicating in the eye, you can just give the drug locally and measure any change in viral replication. If you use the eye as a model to study drug delivery or drug efficacy, you could then use the knowledge you gain to treat viral infection in other places."

Chip Kelly has landed back in the NFL as a head coach.
The San Francisco 49ers announced Thursday they had hired Kelly to be the team's new coach.
Kelly established a 26-21 record in three years with the Philadelphia Eagles but was fired when the team was eliminated from playoff contention in Week 16.
The 49ers had also interviewed former NFL head coach Mike Shanahan, former New York Giants coach Tom Coughlin, Buffalo Bills assistant head coach/running backs coach Anthony Lynn, former Cincinnati Bengals offensive coordinator Hue Jackson (since hired by the Cleveland Browns) and Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter.
In San Francisco, Kelly will be tasked with turning around a team that went 5-11 this season and ranked 31st in total offense as well as last in scoring. Among the franchise's biggest decisions will be how to handle quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who was benched for Blaine Gabbert and later placed on injured reserve.
Kelly replaces Jim Tomsula, who was fired after one season as head coach of the 49ers.

Vladimir Bukovsky, a prominent member of the Russian dissident movement has denied charges made against them in the UK over making and possessing indecent child sex images.
This includes five counts of making indecent images of children, five of possessing indecent images of children, and one count of possessing prohibited images.
Jenny Hopkins, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the CPS in the East of England, said: "Following an investigation by Cambridgeshire Police, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to prosecute Vladimir Bukovsky in relation to the alleged making and possessing of indecent images of children."
The writer and political activist who has been living in the UK since the 1970s, has been summoned to appear at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on 5 May. But they told the media in Britain that it was the first time they had heard of any such suspicions against him. Bukovsky said in a statement:
"I intend to defend myself vigorously on all charges."
Vladimir Bukovsky was a prominent member of the Russian dissident movement, exposing the Soviet leadership's use of psychiatric wards to hold political prisoners. In 1972, they were sentenced to two years in jail and forced into exile for five. After a prisoner swap with the Communist leader Luis Corvalin, imprisoned in Chile, Bukovsky left the USSR and settled in Britain in 1976.
Bukovsky allegedly committed the crimes before October 28, 2014. They deny all charges.
The revelations and extent of child abuse by some famous British celebrities — most notoriously the late Jimmy Savile, shocked society. The British press, often accused of hounding celebrities before cases even make it to court, appear to be less interested in Bukovsky's case…
‘Whoever Talks About China Talks About Himself'
The distinguished author and sinologist Pierre Ryckmans — better known by their pseudonym Simon Leys — died on August 11 in Sydney, Australia, at the age of 78. Participants discuss their prose, their scholarship, and the abiding clarity of their insight into China. — The Editors
Ian Buruma, the Henry R. Luce Professor of Democracy, Human Rights, and Journalism at Bard College:
One of the perils of scholarly specialization in a particular country or culture is monomania. The monomaniacal China-bore, or any other kind of cultural fetishist, becomes oblivious to anything that doesn't concern the area of study. This acquired provincialism is a form of what in colonial times used to be called "going native." This often includes the adoption of prejudices common to the culture one has chosen to learn about.
When sinophiles or Sinologists talk about Japan, for example, they often reflect the ignorant predispositions of their Chinese interlocutors, and the opinions on China held by many Japan-experts show a similar tendency. (This is one reason, in my view, why it was a big mistake to abandon Japanese as a compulsory subject in China studies, just as Chinese ought to be part of any serious scholarship on Japan.)
Leys was the opposite of a China-bore. There was nothing monomaniacal about him. If they had any prejudices, they were informed by their Catholic faith, and not by their Chinese learning.
Indeed, I shall miss Leys most, not because they were "right" about Maoism, which of course they are, but because they were one of the last truly cosmopolitan men of letters. Their essays on André Gide or Evelyn Waugh are as profound and stylish as their work on Chinese painters or the art of calligraphy. They were a literary scholar in the Chinese literati tradition, that is to say, their scholarship was a form of literature.
This is perhaps the only kind of scholarship that will be of lasting interest long after the lifetime of the writer. Academic research will be buried in the work of many others. Scholarly insights will be challenged and revised. Political opinions, however correct and necessary at the time, will lose their freshness and power to provoke.
What lasts is literary style. Few read Edward Gibbon any more to learn about the decline of the Roman Empire.  They are read for their English prose. The reason I cherish all my books by Leys and turn to them often, is because they wrote so beautifully, in French and in English. Leys was one of the great essayists of their age. Their reputation will continue to grow as long as there are people who love language.
Isabel Hilton, a London-based journalist and broadcaster:
When I heard the news of the death of Leys, I began to hunt in my bookshelves for the now yellowing and grimy copies of Chinese Shadows and The Chairman's New Clothes: Mao and the Cultural Revolution, both published in English translation in 1977. I took them down with the pleasure of encountering an old friend and the guilt of realizing how many years have passed since we first talked.
Chinese Shadows was based on recollections and insights gained by the scholarly Sinologist during a six-month stint as the cultural attaché to the Belgian embassy in 1972. Can there ever have been a bleaker time for a man who was devoted to Chinese culture to be a cultural attaché in Beijing?
I had arrived in Beijing a year later, in September 1973, and, like Leys, spent many frustrating months failing to gain access to Beijing's battered and shuttered temples, hunting for cultural treasures that had vanished; imagining, too, the vanished majesty of Beijing's demolished city walls, today miserably memorialized in the route of the second ring road and in the poignant chain of metro stations on line Number 2, a roll call of the magnificent gates for which Leys spent a day in a fruitless search, before their mounting despair and disbelief overwhelmed him.
The contemporary scholars and writers whom Leys admired had been hounded to their deaths or silenced. Beijing, as they wrote, "appears to be a murdered town. The body is still there, the soul has gone. The life of Peking, which created never-ending theater in its streets and squares, the noisy and enjoyable life of the city has gone, leaving only the physical presence of a mute and monochromatic crowd, oppressed by a silence broken only by the tinkle of bicycle bells."
They wrote many more books and steady stream of scholarly articles, but for me, Chinese Shadows and The Chairman's New Clothes occupy a special place. To appreciate their impact, we must recall the binary vision of China that prevailed in the seventies: where western scholars engaged with contemporary China at all — and many in the academy, perhaps understandably, preferred the consolations of classical culture — they tended to divide into warring factions of pro and anti-Maoists, who fought ferocious, polemical battles on ground remote from Chinese realities.
The author of Chinese Shadows was equally animated by their love of Chinese culture and history, and by a fierce engagement with reality, enlivened by an acute satirical sensibility. To me, their insight, wit and forensic judgment crystallized the profound sense of unease that two years in the socialist paradise of the early seventies had generated: the confusion of parallel realities, the frustration of truths forever just out of sight, the suffocating weight of propaganda, made all the heavier by the desire of so many western intellectuals to believe in one last socialist illusion. They were attacked, of course, by the fans of Maoism, but they also declined the embrace of those who attacked China for reasons they did not respect or share. It was their love of China that made them so angry at what had been inflicted upon it.
Leys are not one to join a crowd. In 2012 they began a review in The New York Review of Books of a collection of essays by Liu Xiaobo, an imprisoned Chinese dissident, with two quotations in tribute to Liu: One from the Gospel of St John, "Truth shall set you free;" the other, which could equally well refer to himself, from the historian Sima Qian, "Better than the assent of the crowd, the dissent of one brave man."
Perry Link, Professor Emeritus of East Asian Studies at Princeton University:
No one in the China field has combined profound erudition and stiletto insight as well as Leys. For me they have been the North Star of China watching — equally constant, and just as brilliant. In January 1986, I reviewed their book of essays called The Burning Forest for The Los Angeles Times. The North Star quality in their writing shows in the fact that today, nearly three decades later, I find nothing to revise. Here, condensed but not altered, is what I wrote:
Every time Leys publishes a little book on contemporary China, they tell us it will be their last. In each, they openly express anguish at what they feel duty-bound to report and then says they must desist, since comment is futile and silence more dignified. "To write is to hope," as they put it this time, "and what hope is there left?" But later, they write again.
It is important to distinguish Leys' anti-communism from the garden variety in American popular thought.  They are extremely well-informed and is driven more by passion for China than by any advocacy of the West. Indeed they satirize Western pretensions of superiority, both past and present, with marvelous élan. Their heroes are the Chinese people, both intellectuals and common folk. Politically they resemble George Orwell, a warm supporter of socialism — if it had worked — who finds totalitarianism all the more repugnant because it parades in socialist garb.
Ley mixes their political commentary with fond and exquisitely perceptive tributes to Chinese painters, poets and essayists both ancient and modern. These lovely pieces not only moderate an otherwise caustic tone, but, by exemplifying what Maoism has destroyed, also show why the author is so pained.
They note that China is often misdescribed."Whoever talks about China talks about himself," they write, deftly illustrating the phenomenon in examples that range from Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci to contemporary China watchers, including himself.
Does this lead to the paralyzing conclusion that no Westerner should try to comment on China? No, they say, because there are two ways out. One is to learn more. "Naturally," they write, "the fantasy element is always in inverse proportion to the amount of factual knowledge the observer may possess." The second is to be frank about one's own concerns. Here, for their own case, Leys succeeds admirably. We know where they stand and why. The result is not only a clearer lens for viewing China, but increased appreciation of the lucidity of the author's judgment.
They reserve special venom for China experts who wittingly or unwittingly present happy myth as fact. Having gathered most of their essays under the two headings "Culture" and "Politics," they archly label their third section, on China watchers, as "Hygiene." Their complaints have significance far beyond the several writers they select for criticism. Why, they ask, do most Western intellectuals shrink from applying to China the same standards in human rights that they demand of the Soviet Union or El Salvador? Ley catalogues some standard "lines of escape" from this question: that "we just don't know enough" to make judgments; that "it's no longer a problem in the post-Mao period"; that the material benefits of the revolution make tyranny a small price to pay; that China in any case is "different" and cultural differences must be respected. Ley shows how these excuses are signs more of condescension than of true respect or understanding.
Thioflavin T, a dye used to stain protein aggregates, can extend the lifespan of roundworms and reduce effects of aging, like impeded movement. Silvestre Alavez and their coauthors report in a recent issue of Nature that Thioflavin T increases the median lifespan of roundworms (the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans) by about 60 percent and maximal lifespan by 43 to 78 percent. The effect is concentration dependent, as 50 or 100 µM doses increase life, while doses over 500 µM shorten it.
Besides Thioflavin T, other compounds that bind protein aggregates also extend the lifespan of roundworms, but to lesser extents. Chemicals like curcumin and rifampicin can extend roundworm life up to 45 percent. Compounds that have similar chemical structure to Thioflavin T, like HBX, HBT, and BM, reach maximum effects of lifespan extension at much lower concentrations than Thioflavin T, but can only extend life up to 40 percent.
Alavez and their team found that Thioflavin T lowers amyloid-β aggregation (associated with lesions in Alzheimer's disease) and levels of other proteins that are prone to aggregation. But its effect on protein aggregates may not be directly related to its impact on longevity. Thioflavin T's influence on lifespan seems to involve a stress response, since it relies on genes like HSF-1 (which regulates genes that respond to stress from heat) and SKN-1 (involved in oxidative stress resistance, protein homeostasis, and other stress-response functions).
The researchers also found that Thioflavin T acts independently of dietary restriction, which is another mechanism that has been linked to increasing lifespan.
As Alavez and their team have only conducted studies on microscopic roundworms, further experiments are necessary to determine if the effect of Thioflavin T can be extended to other animals, particularly those with a longer lifespan. Roundworms usually live less than 20 days, so it might be simpler to alter that number by large percentages. To change the lifespan of animals that live over a decade by 60 percent would be far more significant.

Four Republican senators have expressed reservations about their party's plan to repeal Obamacare, throwing the health bill's fate into uncertainty.
Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson, Mike Lee and Rand Paul said they were "not ready to vote for this bill", but were "open to negotiation".
The Senate's Republican leader unveiled their plan to overhaul the US healthcare system after drafting it in secret.
The party can only afford to have two defections to pass the measure.
Republicans need to secure 50 votes when the bill comes to the floor next week. No Democrats are expected to support it.
Forty-three people were arrested on Thursday while protesting against the legislation outside the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who crafted most of the plan.
The statement from the four senators, who are from the more conservative wing of the party, said: "Currently, for a variety of reasons, we are not ready to vote for this bill, but we are open to negotiation and obtaining more information before it is brought to the floor."

The four conservatives are concerned the legislation is not hardline enough, however, two more moderate Republican senators voiced fears it might be too severe.
The bill would slash taxes on the wealthy as well as insurance and drug companies, all paid for by steep cuts to Medicaid, a government medical programme for the poor and the majority of older Americans in nursing homes.
Senator Dean Heller - who faces re-election next year - said they had "serious concerns" about the bill's impact on their home state of Nevada.
"As I have consistently stated, if the bill is good for Nevada, I'll vote for it and if it's not - I won't," they said in a statement.
Susan Collins of Maine said it was "too soon" to decide on whether they would vote for the bill.
They expressed "concerns" about the proposed Medicaid cuts and eliminating funding for the women's health group Planned Parenthood for a year.

The 142-page "discussion draft" scraps most of President Barack Obama's 2010 signature health law, including dropping the requirement for individuals to have health insurance.
Repealing Mr Obama's law, called the Affordable Care Act but also known as Obamacare, was a central promise of Republicans throughout their presidency.
In a Facebook post, Mr Obama said there was a "fundamental meanness" at the core of the Republican bill.
They described it as "a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America".
The Senate's legislation follows the House of Representatives version, which passed the lower chamber six weeks ago.
The proposals affect tens of millions of Americans and a sixth of the US economy.
What's in the Senate bill?
"Republicans believe we have a responsibility to act - and we are," Mr McConnell said after presenting the Better Care Reconciliation Act Of 2017 to the upper chamber on Thursday.
The bill mostly aligns with the House plan, but ties federal subsidies for individuals based on their income rather than age - as the Affordable Care Act currently does.
It would make it more difficult for recipients to qualify for those subsidies, however, by implementing more restrictions on income requirements.
Critics of the House bill, which tied the subsidies to age, say it unfairly penalised older Americans.
The Senate plan phases out the expansion of Medicaid more gradually than the House bill.
But it would impose deeper long-term cuts to the programme.
The bill also gives states more latitude in requiring insurers to provide essential health benefits guaranteed under Obamacare, including emergency and maternity care and mental health services.
The great unveiling - Anthony Zurcher, BBC News North America reporter
The curtain has finally come up on the Senate healthcare bill, and the product of weeks of back-room negotiations looks a lot like the oft-derided House version.
Sure, there are a few key differences. In some places, it's more moderate - keeping in place income-adjusted subsidies to help less affluent Americans purchase insurance, for instance.
In other areas the cuts are actually much more aggressive.
It appears Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hopes to mollify moderates and hard-liners by pushing the painful changes to low-income insurance programmes farther down the road.
Whether that's enough to cobble together the bare-minimum 50 votes necessary from the 52 Republicans in the Senate will be the big question next week.
They party has spent the last seven years saying it would tear Obamacare up "root and branch", in Mr McConnell's words, and they can't risk walking away empty handed.
What happens next?
Senator McConnell expects the bill to come to the Senate floor as early as next week, when the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office releases the plan's estimated cost and impact on Americans.
The Republican Senate leadership is hoping to pass the measure, before sending it back to the House for approval of the new draft.
The House would need to pass the bill as it stands and send it to President Donald Trump's desk to sign into law or draft another version, which both chambers would again have to approve.
Mr Trump has previously referred to the House version as "mean" and implored senators to draft a more "generous" version.
Damage Episode Synopsis 10/18/2017 5:36 pm
Originally titled, "Two Rings" it will be the thrid time director Kevin Smith returns to the director chair. The episode, now titled "Damage" is Supergirl's fifth episode of season 3. From the official description provided in the press release we can surmise that Morgan Edge is back and plans their first PR and perhaps other attack on Lena Luthor. In a new pairing, Samantha Arias, acting CEO of L Corp, and Kara team up to clear Lena's name after being accused of lead poising children in National City after releasing the attack on the Daxamites. Furthermore, Alex and Maggie face some hard truths. Here is the official description:
MORGAN EDGE SETS Their SIGHTS ON LENA — When multiple children get sick from lead poisoning, Morgan Edge (guest star Adrian Pasdar) points the finger at Lena (Katie McGrath) and blames their creation of the lead bomb they made to save National City from the Daxamites. While Lena knows they never intended any harm, they fear there may have been a flaw in their design, leaving them responsible. Kara (Melissa Benoist) teams up with Samantha (Odette Annable) to clear Lena's name, but it turns out to be harder than they thought. Meanwhile, Alex (Chyler Leigh) and Maggie (guest star Floriana Lima) make a crucial decision about the future of their relationship. Kevin Smith directed the episode written by Eric Carrasco & Cindy Lichtman
With the original title being two rings and now being titled, Damange, we are quite curious what might be behind this episode. Let us know what you think in the comments below and in the forum! Keep us your advertisement free source for Supergirl news and visit the support page!
Neurologist Explains What's Off-Putting With Ted Cruz's Face
Trending News: A Neurologist Explains What's Wrong With Ted Cruz's Expressions
Why Is This Important?
Because just about all humans are experts at reading body language.
Long Story Short
A neurologist explains why Senator and Republican Presidential candidate Ted Cruz's face, pretty much regardless of your politics, makes you want to sock him. In short, it's because they don't express emotion the way we expect, and that's unsettling.
Long Story
It's Primary election day in New Hampshire, and despite a surprising win in the Iowa Caucuses, Senator Ted Cruz is a longshot for the Republican win according to early forecasts. Part of that is due to a smaller evangelical cohort in New Hampshire, sure, but also because there's something about Ted Cruz's face that makes you want to rear back and slug him. Writing at Psychology Today, neurologist Richard E. Cytowic thinks he's figured out why: Their face does not act like a normal face.
The degree to which people dislike Cruz is astonishing. Sure, their policies range from absurd to odious in the eyes of many, but their relatively robust support is proof that not everyone finds their words appalling. Indeed, even people within their own party in the Senate, people with whom they would appear to share ideological commonalities, can't stand him. One site even set out on a quest to confirm an unstated sexual rumor about Cruz's college days, and in the process inadvertently found that practically no one who's met them likes him. Cytowic says it's because when Cruz expresses emotion (or at least pretends to), their face doesn't move the way humans have been conditioned to expect:
"I have rarely, if ever, seen a conventional smile from Senator Cruz. In a natural smile the corners of the mouth go up; these muscles we can control voluntarily as well. But muscles circling the eyes are involuntary only; they make the eyes narrow, forming crow's feet at the outside corners. Even the Mona Lisa's smile shows this... No matter the emotional coloring of Senator Cruz's outward rhetoric, their mouth typically tightens into the same straight line. If it deviates from this, the corners of their mouth bend down, not upwards. The outside of their eyebrows bend down, too, when they emote, something so atypical that it disturbs me."
Downturned expressions, they continue, typically signal to observers contempt or distrust, not unlike what we see in "resting bitch face." Humans, having lived as long as we have, became expert face-readers hundreds of thousands of years ago, as being able to tell friend from foe was essential to survival. It's not nearly as essential nowadays, but our brains haven't changed all that much. Seeing someone convey negative emotions (especially when they're trying not to) makes us subconsciously want to back away.

The now-conventional wisdom that John F. Kennedy bested Nixon in their 1960 debate because they looked better on television is largely overstated, but people nevertheless would prefer candidates they find easy to look at. Until Ted Cruz can find a credible body language coach, that probably won't be him.

Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement Civil liberties groups have reacted angrily to US President Barack Obama's decision to revive military trials for some Guantanamo Bay detainees. Mr Obama has previously denounced the Bush-era judicial system, but in a statement said new safeguards would ensure suspects got a fairer hearing. New rules include rejecting statements obtained from harsh interrogations and limitations on using hearsay evidence. There are still 240 detainees at the US base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Barack Obama branded the original military trials an enormous failure Mr Obama halted the controversial military commissions as one of their first acts on taking office in January, saying the US was entering a new era of respecting human rights. "It's disappointing that Obama is seeking to revive rather than end this failed experiment," said Jonathan Hafetz, a national security attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union. "There is no detainee at Guantanamo who cannot be tried and shouldn't be tried in the regular federal courts system. This is perpetuating the Bush administration's misguided detention policy." Kenneth Roth, head of Human Rights Watch, said: "By resurrecting this failed Bush administration idea, President Obama is backtracking dangerously on their reform agenda." Campaign statement On the campaign trail last year, Mr Obama had branded the military commissions "an enormous failure". But in the statement issued on Friday, they said they had supported their use as one avenue to try detainees, and in 2006 had voted in favour of them. They said they had opposed the tribunals used by George W Bush's administration because they had failed to establish a legitimate legal framework and undermined swift and certain justice. The extra safeguards for detainees include a ban on evidence obtained by harsh interrogation; restrictions on hearsay evidence; giving detainees more leeway to choose their own lawyers and protecting detainees who refuse to testify, the statement said. Mr Obama said they were seeking more time so that the new procedures could be implemented.
Text: Obama statement Obama's balancing act Justin Webb on Guantanamo Send us your comments "These reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution, while bringing them in line with the rule of law," they said. "This is the best way to protect our country, while upholding our deeply held values." But Geneve Mantri, of Amnesty International, said Mr Obama's message was confusing. "It was clear from their announcements soon after they reached the White House what they were going to do," they said. "Now it is somewhat confusing what the administration's standard is or what their policies are." Zachary Katznelson of Reprieve, which represents a number of Guantanamo Bay detainees, told the BBC that the president was making a "fundamental mistake". "He is taking a gravely, truly flawed system, tinkering at the edges and hoping that the world is somehow going to see this as legitimate, as open, as fair - it's not going to happen," they said. In contrast, Mr Obama found support for their decision among their opponents. "I am pleased that President Obama has now adopted this view," said Republican Senator John McCain, who lost the presidential election to Mr Obama. Ari Fleischer, who was George W Bush's first press secretary, said President Obama "should acknowledge their campaign criticisms were wrong". "With some minor changes, they really are following the same path President Bush pursued," they said. Pragmatic style The BBC's James Coomarasamy in Washington says that although some are disappointed, for others it is further evidence of Mr Obama's pragmatic style of leadership, one that recognises the need to balance the change they have promised with the reality they have inherited. Mr Obama has said they want the Guantanamo Bay camp closed by 2010. Shortly before their announcement, US officials said that Algerian detainee Lakhdar Boumediene had left Guantanamo Bay for France. Mr Boumediene was arrested in Bosnia in 2001 and was held for seven years. They were cleared of any wrongdoing in November. US MEDIA REACTION TO OBAMA'S DECISION Obama officials have been dispatched to insist to journalists (anonymously, of course) that Obama's embrace of "new and improved" military commissions is neither inconsistent with the criticisms that were voiced about Bush's military commission system nor with Obama's prior statements on this issue. It is plainly not the case that these "modifications" address the core criticisms directed to what Bush did, nor is it the case that Obama's campaign position on this issue can be reconciled with what they are now doing.
Salon's Glenn Greenwald thinks Obama has performed a big U-turn. President Obama, and the country at large, is finding out that George W Bush's most controversial policies were not born of ideological delusion, American arrogance, or missionary zeal. They were imperfect but sound (with the exception of our ties to Riyadh) responses to complicated threats. But the validation of the last president runs a very distant second to the most compelling aspect of all this: the drama over CIA interrogations and Guantanamo will hopefully serve to set the administration on a more serious national security course. And it would be helpful if the American public finally dropped moral outrage as the preferred mode of political argumentation.
Abe Greenwald, writing in Commentary magazine, thinks that now is "a good time to be George W. Bush". The revival of the commissions seems to be directed at the often referred to "third category" of detainees, those whom the government believes are too dangerous to let go but are unable to try.
The American Prospect's Adam Serwer speculates that the new proposals are a way of "getting round" the US constitution. Let me see if I've got this right: The previous extra-legal system wasn't up to snuff because it wasn't codified enough? The new! improved! Obama-era secret trials will be better because they are swifter and more certain? Seriously? The introductory statement alone, to me, undermines the whole premise that this is by any stretch an acceptable substitute for time-tested United States criminal code prosecution.

Rian Johnson's film was made with the help of Chinese funding in Shanghai and satisfies country's appetite for action
Artistes can be notoriously reluctant to compromise their creative vision at the behest of the Man. Not so director Rian Johnson. They agreed to transplant the plot of their latest sci-fi blockbuster to another continent – from Paris to Shanghai – in order to gain lucrative Chinese funding.
The switch paid off: this weekend Looper became the first new Hollywood film to make more money in its opening weekend in China than the US, provisional figures suggest.
"I'm thrilled the movie did so well in China. I don't think any of us expected this kind of numbers. It's fascinating to watch that market emerge and crazy to suddenly be part of the story," Johnson said.
They insisted shifting the action from France to China was not a creative sell-out, but "gave us production value we'd never dream of". They added: "In many ways Shanghai was a more natural setting for a sci-fi movie than my beloved Paris."
The film, which was shot for just $30m (£18.5m) and stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis as two versions of a futuristic hitman, made an estimated $21m on debut in the US. But according to Deadline it is likely to return $23m-$25m in China.
The change in location, along with a number of other concessions, allowed Johnson's tale of time-travelling hitmen to become a US-Chinese co-production, allowing it to bypass strict rules on the number of foreign films shown in Chinese cinemas.
Only 34 foreign features are allowed to be shown in Chinese cinemas each year. Co-productions, however, are exempt from this strict quota system, giving them a huge advantage in the world's most populous nation.
Looper's stunning performance is sure to encourage other directors to tweak their work in order to appeal to the increasingly lucrative Sino audience, said Robert Cain, a producer and entertainment industry consultant who has been doing business in China since 1987. "We will see far more of this in the future," they said. "Like everywhere else in the world, Chinese people like watching films set in places they know, starring people who look like them."
During a five-day visit to Beijing last month, Titanic and Avatar director James Cameron said they were looking very seriously at the possibility of a co-production with China. They said they were visiting the country on a fact-finding mission to "find out what restrictions need to be met, find out what content guidelines need to be met, and find out the economic incentives are".
The 3D re-issue of Cameron's Titanic earlier this year became the first Hollywood film to perform better in China than the US on opening. It ended up grossing $154.8m in China, compared with $57.9m in the states. More co-productions are likely after China announced in May it was to build a $1.27bn Hollywood co-production film studio.
Doing business in China means dicing with the country's strict censor board. Earlier this year, the baddies from Men In Black 3 were excised from the China edition after the censors took offence at the fact they were all Chinese.
Portraying any public official in anything other than a glowing light was a risk in China, said Cain: "Police officers are always honest people of integrity who always catch their man. Tthere is no bloody crime in China, no homosexuality, no nudity and no 'excessively terrifying scenes'. Horror is very difficult in China. You can't have ghosts or gore, no demons or monsters."
With a potential 1.34 billion cinemagoers, China this year overtook Japan to become the biggest foreign market for Hollywood films. Twenty-five thousand screens are set to be installed in the country over the next five years, many with the latest 4k digital technology. China has also become the fastest growing IMAX market in the world, already home to 78 IMAX cinemas, six times as many as the number in the early 2010. And the country is launching its own version of IMAX technology, called DMAX.
Already China boasts the third largest annual box office returns in the world. In 2011 alone, it rose by an annual rate of 18% to 12bn yuan (about £1.22bn).
China's spiralling demand for movies is propping up the ailing US box office – last year Chinese cinemagoers helped offset a drop in the US box office of 3.5% to $10.2bn, the lowest return in 16 years.
It's easy to sum up what sort of film goes down well in China, said Cain. "Action, number one. Action, number two – and action, number three."
Film critic Craig Skinner said Hollywood "spectacle" films with simple plots do best in China. "Films which are visually impressive and not too hard to digest perform well at the box office in China – plots which do not require the viewer to be familiar with certain cultural aspects," they said, citing Avatar as an example of a universally understood story which became the highest grossing movie in China in 2010, raking in 540m yuan ($85.6m) in only 15 days. One of the worst performing foreign films in China last year was The King's Speech, starring Colin Firth as the stuttering monarch George VI.

The trials of tens of thousands of people will be the biggest legal process in Turkey's history and are set to put the system under unprecedented strain.
Istanbul // Turkey courts have placed 32,000 suspects under arrest on charges of links to a group run by the US-based preacher blamed for the failed coup bid in July, as the country braces for the most extensive trials in its history.
Of the 70,000 people investigated after the attempted putsch on July 15, 32,000 of them have been remanded in custody, justice minister Bekir Bozdag told NTV television on Wednesday.
“This process is continuing,” they said. The numbers of those arrested marks an increase of more than 10,000 from those previously given by the government.
Mr Bozdag said that there could be new arrests, while some of those currently arrested could still be freed under judicial control or freed entirely.
Some two-and-a-half months after the coup attempt aimed at ousting president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan led to a crackdown unprecedented in Turkey's modern history. There is still no indication as to when trials might start.
The trials of tens of thousands of people will be the biggest legal process in Turkey's history and are set to put the system under unprecedented strain.
Turkey has already granted some 38,000 convicts early release in an apparent bid to create more space in cramped jails for the coup suspects.

I'm worried. I am very worried. You should be too.
Many national organisations representing people with disabilities are about to lose their funding, including Deaf Australia, which represents me.
If this happens, Deaf Australia could be forced to return to what it was in the 1980s, a small volunteer-run organisation with no funds. But in the 1980s volunteering was a strong part of our culture. The world is different now. People volunteer a lot less.
What will life be like for us if this happens?
Not good. Not good at all.
The price of liberty, they say, is eternal vigilance. The progress our representative organisations have made for us over the years has been about our human rights, our liberty.
For deaf people, the National Relay Service, new and improved interpreting services, captioning, Auslan/English bilingual education and early intervention; all these things give us access and the freedom to make our own choices. For people with other disabilities, it means things like accessible premises and transport.
When funding for organisations that advocate for us is gone, who will be there to be vigilant for us?
The gains we have made will be eroded. The onslaught has already begun: just a couple of weeks ago the government introduced a bill into Parliament seeking to wind back compulsory reporting and other protections of TV captioning.
With interventions from Deaf Australia and other organisations , and Get Up petitions signed by many of us, this bill has now been referred to a Senate committee. We still have a chance of retaining these protections, so long as organisations like Deaf Australia are able to do this work of fighting to protect our rights.
Without Deaf Australia and similar organisations for other disability groups what will happen in these situations?
We will all be on our own, fighting for our rights ourselves and struggling to be heard.
Years ago on my way to work each morning at the State Library of NSW, I used to walk past NSW Parliament House and often there would be a lone person outside the fence with a placard, sometimes a small group of people. And always I'd think to myself: “You're wasting your time. You haven't got a hope in hell of having your issue heard.”
This will likely be us soon.
The threat to our ability to be heard, and ultimately our liberty, is happening because the Australian Government is introducing a new funding model. Currently peak representative organisations are funded under a program called National Secretariat Funding. The new program is called Sector Development for Disability Representative Organisations (SDDRO).
It was released in July this year. When I looked at the information I was horrified. In a nutshell, instead of funding 13 national disability representative organisations as they do now, government wants to fund seven. Instead of the recurrent funding they were receiving, everyone had to apply for funding in a competitive tender. The outcome is expected to be known in December.
The seven disability ‘population' groups that will be funded under this new SDDRO model are: women, Aboriginals, people from a Cultural and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) background, children, service providers and two cross-disability consortiums.
So five organisations currently funded will likely continue to be funded. Eight will be out in the cold. These eight plus any others not currently funded but needing funds, will have to squeeze into the two cross disability consortiums.
Only three of the five are actually Disabled Person's Organisations (DPOs – organisations controlled by people with disabilities themselves); one is controlled by parents and one represents service providers. Why will service providers be funded to advocate for themselves when so many DPOs won't be? Why are the interests of service providers more important than the interests of the people who use their services? Go figure!
Each of the seven organisations/consortiums will get $300,000 per year. (Most get about $165,000 now; National Disability Services, representing service providers, gets about $350,000 now.)
So if there are, say, 15 organisations in a cross-disability consortium, then each will perhaps get $20,000. If the consortium's application is successful; it might not be, in which case they will get nothing.
According to government, this new model is their way of ‘encouraging' the disability sector to ‘organise itself'. Fiddlesticks I say!
Why has government decided to do this?
It has been said that the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) will give people with disabilities the support they need, so most won't need advocacy anymore.
More fiddlesticks! Many things are not included in the NDIS: education, employment, health services, transport and so on. We still need advocacy for these things. We still need advocacy to ensure the NDIS does what it should!
And anyway, bureaucrats in the Department of Social Services have been working on a new funding model for years, since long before the NDIS was a blip in Bruce Bonyhady's imagination. I know this because I was one of the people ‘consulted' about it over many years.
Government is constantly bombarded by requests to fund representative organisations. Many disability groups receive none, e.g., people with Down Syndrome and people with autism. Government has constantly cried “no money!” Yet a few years ago Children with Disability Australia, run by parents, received funding for the first time.
Why has government decided to fund what they call ‘population groups' – i.e. women, children, Aboriginals, and people from a CALD background – and force what they call ‘diagnostic groups' into cross-disability consortiums that have to thinly share funding?
One, they say the model is based on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). The UNCRPD talks about all people with disabilities collectively and it specifically refers to women, children, Indigenous and ethnic people.
Two, they say that the new funding model discards the ‘medical' model and uses the ‘social' model for which we have all been advocating.
Both of these rationales are disgraceful misinterpretations, pathetic excuses to narrow down funding decisions.
The UNCRPD also refers to many other ‘population' groups such as race, colour, religion, and to specific ‘diagnostic' disability groups such as deaf people and blind people and their specific needs such as sign language and Braille. Government has simply cherry picked a few ‘flavours of the month'.
And clearly they do not understand what a ‘social' model for disability means.
A ‘medical' model treats people as having medical problem that need to be fixed. A ‘social' model treats us as a whole person and fixes the social environment so it includes us.
But Government has misinterpreted this to mean that it's not about medical diagnoses anymore; therefore, ‘diagnostic groups' (deaf, blind, autistic, intellectual etc) no longer need attention or significant funding. Only ‘social' groups like women, children, Aboriginal and CALD people do!
They have not understood or have ignored, for example, that while some deaf women do have issues that are women's issues such as domestic violence, most of their issues are communication issues directly related to deafness. A women's organisation isn't going to be focussed on communication: it's a deaf issue, not a women's issue.
And who's going to be looking after the deaf men's communication issues?
They have not understood that in cross disability consortiums someone still has to provide expert advice on the rights of specific disability groups. If representative organisations don't have sufficient funding to do this then the voice of these groups will not be heard.
If all this didn't have such disastrous consequences for so many millions of us, its stupendous stupidity would be hilarious.
After all the work so many of us did on explaining all this to government in so many ‘consultations' it is so disheartening that they have made these decisions that disenfranchise so many.
They are going the wrong way! They need to go back and rethink the whole thing!
The other day, someone remarked that it's probably too late to do anything about this new model. That was what motivated me to write this post.
It's not too late. Final decisions are expected in December. Government can change course at any time.
Government can decide to throw out this disastrous new model. They can renew the funding that peak disability organisations currently get for another year or three and they can go back to the drawing board. They can, for once, actually listen to people with disabilities. They can do the right thing.
It's time for all of us to stand up and tell them this is what they must do.
People have asked me, “Why aren't representative organisations saying much about this? Why aren't they making more noise?”
These organisations are between a rock and a hard place. It's hard for them to know the best way to deal with this. If they say too much and seriously anger government they could ruin their chance for funding of any kind. If they say too little, they could miss a fairer deal.
And anyway, government – Ministers and bureaucrats – won't talk to them about it while funding decisions are in process.
So it's up to us, the community, to do something. The organisations that represent us and our disabled family members and friends now need us to stand up for them.
If we don't, they may no longer be there for us, they may not be able to protect our rights anymore.
Everyone can help, whether you are disabled or not.
Send an email to Kevin Andrews, Minister for Social Services kevin.andrews.mp@aph.gov.au and to Mitch Fifield, Assistant Minister for Social Services senator.fifield@aph.gov.au
Tell them:
The new Sector Development for Disability Representative Organisations funding model will be disastrous for millions of disabled people and is the wrong thing to do. The government needs to throw it out and develop a new model that looks after everyone fairly, not just a few selected ‘population' groups and service providers. Until government has done this, the current National Secretariat Funding model needs to be retained.
Remember to include your name in the email, and something in the subject field, e.g.: Funding for disability representative organisations.

Alabama Sheriff In Court For Starving Inmates, Paying Critic's Grandson To Install Keylogger On Them Computer
from the just-make-it-out-to-'cash'-and-save-everyone-the-hassle dept
A number of statutes and practices have created perverse incentives for law enforcement, but none are nearly so blatant as this Alabama state law governing the feeding of inmates. The law, passed over 100 years ago, says law enforcement personnel -- mainly sheriffs -- can keep whatever's left over from state and federal inmate food stipends. This doesn't mean the leftover money is routed to a general fund or used to defray law enforcement/jail-related expenses. No, this means the money flows from taxpayers, (mostly) bypasses prisoners, and ends up in sheriffs' personal checking accounts. (via Radley Balko)
This legalized skimming has resulted in the obvious: underfed inmates and sheriffs with overfed bank accounts. The law first received national attention in 2008, when Morgan County sheriff Greg Bartlett found themselves in federal court, defending themselves against a lawsuit brought by their prisoners. Inmates were dropping weight and going hungry while Bartlett increased their personal income by $212,000 over three years, taking home a great deal of the $1.75 per prisoner per day state funds. (Federal prisoners housed in state jails are allowed $3 per day, which can also be rerouted to sheriffs' checking accounts.)
This resulted in Bartlett spending one night in their own jail. Even then, Sheriff Bartlett was violating an earlier consent decree with the federal government, which ordered their office to use *all* food funds for feeding inmates. The agreement Bartlett reached with the court (after a night in jail) promised their office would do the same thing: spend all the funds on food, rather than diverting them for personal use.
Even with two consent decrees in place and a previous sheriff being hauled into court for personally profiting from inmates' hunger, another Morgan County sheriff (Ana Franklin) has repeated their predecessor's misdeeds.
At that hearing, the sheriff's attorneys are expected to argue that a years-old consent decree in a lawsuit against the county does not apply to Franklin and they shouldn't be held in contempt. The decree says the Morgan County Sheriff must spend all food funds on inmate meals. The decree was issued in 2009 after Franklin's predecessor was jailed for contempt. Former Sheriff Greg Bartlett was dubbed "Sheriff Corndog" because they profited more than $200,000 while inmates ate corndogs twice a day for weeks. The consent decree stemmed from a 2001 lawsuit against the county and then-Sheriff Steve Crabbe by inmates decrying conditions inside the jail. A court hearing was scheduled last month when the Center filed a motion saying Franklin should show cause for why they shouldn't be held in contempt of the decree. The center argued that Franklin should have been held in contempt after removing $160,000 from the inmate food account. The sheriff loaned $150,000 of the money to a now-bankrupt, corrupt used car dealership, Priceville Partners, LLC, that was co-owned by Greg Steenson, a convicted felon.
Franklin is trying to convince the court they should be allowed to continue starving inmates and financing criminal business ventures. While Sheriff Franklin was helping prop up local business corruption, inmates were dealing with this reality:
The [Southern Center for Human Rights] is arguing Franklin should not be allowed to keep any of the food funds and has included in court documents statements from inmates who describe inadequate food portions and unappetizing or hazardous servings. Inmates reported finding rocks, a nail and mold in food served at the jail. "Many grievances note that entire cell blocks were fed reduced or watered-down portions -- a tiny amount of soup, a spoonful of grits, five or six green beans or carrot slices as a vegetable serving, a sandwich with half of a slice of cheese on it, and the like -- because the kitchen lacked enough food to serve everyone the portions listed on the menu," according to court records filed by the Center.
Starving prisoners to fund personal business ventures isn't the only thing Sheriff Franklin's accused of doing, though. A longtime critic of Franklin -- blogger/business owner Glenda Lockhart -- has also filed a lawsuit against the sheriff, alleging a number of constitutional violations.
The lawsuit accuses Franklin of illegally obtaining information to convince a judge to issue a search warrant for Lockhart's home and business. Franklin has said their office seized computers and various other devices during an investigation into fired jail warden Leon Bradley, who has been accused of leaking documents to Lockhart for publication on the blog.
Lockhart's blog was where Sheriff Franklin's payments to the corrupt car dealership first appeared. In apparent retaliation, the sheriff allegedly engaged in some incredibly underhanded -- and illegal -- tactics in their attempt to obtain the blogger's personal communications.
Lockhart claims Franklin illegally gathered information for a search warrant by paying an informant to break in, hack and steal data from their home and business offices. Lockhart owns Straightline Drywall and Acoustical, LLC in Falkville. The informant, Lockhart's grandson Daniel, said in a sworn statement that they were paid to install keylogger software on their grandmother's computer. The software, they said, was provided by the sheriff's office, according to a transcript from a November 2016 deposition.
Daniel Lockhart's statement also said the sheriff told them they were only interested in going after the former warden who was leaking documents and that Daniel's grandmother wouldn't be targeted. Their statement also points out they were paid directly by the sheriff and one of their deputies a total of $500 to perform this "investigative" work for them.
There appears to be corruption all over the place in Morgan County, Alabama. But it all starts with a bad law state lawmakers are in no hurry to take off the books. Despite multiple federal lawsuits stemming from sheriffs' starve-and-skim tactics, the incredibly perverse incentive remains intact. There are probably plenty of taxpayers who don't like the idea of their money being used to food and house convicted criminals, but I doubt any of those taxpayers are happier knowing they're padding sheriffs' bank accounts and investing in shady businesses.

The decline in books stocked by public libraries may be far worse than official figures indicate, with industry sources claiming that it may be many millions higher than the 25 million books recorded as missing, meaning that the number of books available to borrowers has plummeted by more than 50% since 1996.
Librarians are calling for a national audit to reveal the true extent of the problem, with the news coming as the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (Cilip) sent an open letter to chancellor Philip Hammond calling on them to increase funding for the sector, to protect it from irreparable decline as part of their strategy for economic growth.
Official figures from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa) for library books stood at 52.3 million at the end of 2016, a drop of almost 25 million since 1996. But that number reflects computer records rather than physical stock checks made by librarians. Earlier this week, it emerged that libraries in Suffolk had 10,000 fewer books than listed on its database after an inventory count by librarians. Insiders said similar disparities were likely to be reflected across the 151 library authorities in England and Wales because cutbacks had reduced librarians' ability to do shelf counts.
Library campaigner and former head of Waterstones Tim Coates said: “It's not just Suffolk that has this problem. This is a national issue, because librarians are not doing enough stock checks because cuts mean they can't do their job properly.” They added that throughout the book industry, it was acknowledged that inventory reviews always revealed there to be fewer books in store than databases suggested.

Cilip chief executive officer Nick Poole agreed with Coates, and said that six years of austerity had left librarians unable to keep track of their book collections as well as in the past. “We need a national audit of what's in our libraries,” they said. “Because we have had to pursue lots of other activities, we have taken our eye off the ball with books and they are absolutely at the core of what we do and why people use libraries.”
Poole blamed the problem on swingeing cuts to budgets as a result of austerity measures imposed on local authorities by central government over the past six years. Cutbacks have resulted £25m being slashed from library budgets in just the past year. Since 2010, 8,000 librarians have been made redundant across England and Wales – a quarter of the workforce – while the number of libraries has fallen by 340 since 2008.
The level of books stocked by individual libraries has also fallen dramatically. In 1996, the average library stocked 23,000 books, Coates said. “Since then we have removed the equivalent of 1,000 public libraries worth of books and the picture may be much worse once audited,” they added.
Stock is lost through damage, loss and theft. In the past, books would be automatically replaced, but there is less money available in budgets to buy replacements. In Birmingham, savings of £113m imposed on the city council led to book budgets being suspended across its 38 libraries in 2015. Some branches appealed to the public to donate books less than a year old in order to maintain their collections.
The head of one library authority told the Guardian they were confident that Suffolk's missing stock levels were typical, but there was little money to fill holes. “Most stock budgets have gone down on the premise that we can buy more ebooks, but the money is spread thinner because we have to buy electronic copies on top of the paper copy of each title, so we can't buy the multiple paper copies of books that we used to,” they said.
Book budgets have been first in line for cuts because they were less visible to the public, they added. “People can see when hours are reduced or libraries closed, but stock budgets are not so obvious, so they are easier to cut.” Books not being replaced were most often children's books, they said, and self-help books, a genre most likely to be stolen from their library.
Council leaders laid the blame for the destruction of book stock firmly with central government. Ian Stephens, chair of the Local Government Association's culture, tourism and sport board, said local authorities were doing everything they could to support libraries, but were “stuck between a rock and a hard place”. “On the one hand, demand for social care will create a funding gap of £2.6bn by 2020. On the other, councils have experienced a 40% reduction in central government funding over the last parliament alone, and serious funding pressures continue,” they told the Guardian.
In their letter shown to the Guardian, Cilip's Nick Poole called on the chancellor of the exchequer to ring fence library budgets in order to protect them from cash strapped councils trying to shore up frontline services. It also called for investment by central government in the sector in recognition of role libraries play in promoting knowledge, information and data, which, they said, were vital for the economic future of the country.

Describing investment in the library and information sector as a “low-cost, high-impact” way to deliver the government's goals of creating strong growth while maintaining low taxes, Poole wrote: “As a nation, at exactly the moment when we ought to be investing in literacy and skills, we have allowed at least 10% of our public libraries and many of our much-needed school libraries to close while many others have been forced to implement drastic reductions to opening hours and services.”
Hammond had an opportunity to kick-start Britain's knowledge economy by being the first UK chancellor to truly invest in our world-class library and information sector, Poole added. They warned: “If you don't take this opportunity, there is a real risk that your government's aspirations for a global Britain will be built on thin air.”
The Libraries Taskforce, a government-appointed body, outlined a national strategy to tackle problems faced by libraries in December 2016. A spokesperson for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport said ebook and e-magazine stock across the country had increased by more than 50% in the last year and added: “The Libraries Taskforce is committed to working with councils to improve procurement processes.”
Who's slated to attend, what they might show, and who has told us they're skipping out.
The inaugural PC Gaming Show was perhaps the single most excruciating event to be broadcast live from last year's E3. And that's saying something.
Looking back, it's hard to decide which was the worst part. Maybe it was how Sean Murray ended the show by chuckling to themselves over year-old trailers of No Man's Sky. Or perhaps it was when Chris Roberts phoned it in from England simply to remind people that Star Citizen was still being made. Any way you slice it, the PC Gamer-powered, AMD-sponsored event was kind of a disaster. So this year, they decided to try again. What's changing? So far as we can tell, almost nothing besides the start time: noon PT on Monday, June 13. This year's show will have the same host — the likable Sean "Day9" Plott — and the same late-night-talk-show format. It's also, I'm told, only going to run about half as long as last year's debacle. But, given virtually the same laundry list of participants and sponsors, I'm not holding my breath. Here are all the companies who have confirmed their participation, and one that pulled out of the event, as well as some thoughts on what to expect from each of them.
Blizzard Entertainment
Blizzard Entertainment Last year, the team from Blizzard plopped down to talk about Heroes of the Storm's first campaign, Eternal Conflict, and introduce a few new characters. Since then, the game has seen good traction among MOBA fans. Feature: The mad scientists of Blizzard Polygon spoke to the team at Blizzard to learn the methods behind sound in video games. With events like BlizzCon and E3 itself garnering more attention for properties like World of Warcraft, we expect Blizzard will take a similar approach to the PC Gaming Show this year. As it turns out, Heroes of the Storm fans are expecting a big overhaul to ranked play to drop right after E3. It will introduce the game's first ranked season, with all-new tiers and divisions as well as other features. Blizzard's time on the couch could be devoted to that upgrade, or a yet-unannounced, follow-up campaign. Of course, it's possible that Blizzard could use its time to talk about Hearthstone instead, whose latest expansion, Whispers of the Old Gods, has kicked that collectible card game's community into high gear.
Bohemia Interactive The team behind Arma 3 should have a lot to talk about with the game's next expansion on the horizon, Apex. The centerpiece is a 100-square-kilometer South Pacific island archipelago called Tanoa. What was teased last year was exciting, featuring unique terrain like extinct volcanoes, quarries, dense jungle and the 60-year-old remains of World War II fighter planes. For modders looking to build Vietnam-themed missions, it's sure to be a windfall. Also on the horizon for Arma 3 is a rather impressive graphics overhaul, new vehicles and weapons, and a much-anticipated cooperative campaign. Meanwhile, Bohemia's DayZ team recently released its 0.60 update to the experimental branch of the game, and longtime fans are telling me that it solves many of the game's performance problems. Look for creative director Brian Hicks to stop by for an update on the road ahead.
Cloud Imperium Games Last year, developer Chris Roberts promised to show up in person at the 2016 PC Gaming Show to talk about Star Citizen. However, Polygon has learned that Roberts will not be on hand. Cloud Imperium will not be participating in the PC Gaming Show despite agreeing several months ago to do so. A representative for Cloud Imperium tells us that Roberts sent PC Gamer their regrets just a few weeks ago, saying that their schedule won't allow for a trip to Los Angeles. In fact, the studio is skipping E3 entirely. Instead, the spokesperson tells us that Roberts will be devoting all their efforts to work on Squadron 42 at their studio in England. The rep added that the studio will have something to show at Gamescom in August.
The Creative Assembly Total War: Warhammer just launched, and with luck, The Creative Assembly will be on hand to talk about more than just how well it's been selling. Some hints as to the first batch of downloadable content would be welcome. There's also the off chance they could have more information on Total War: Arena, the free-to-play multiplayer version of the classic series, which was first announced in 2013. The very first footage of alpha gameplay was shown a little more than a year ago. Hands-on with LawBreakers It's not over till it's over in Cliff Bleszinski's next big project Nexon While we haven't been told for certain, it's safe to assume that Nexon's sacrificial offering to the PC Gaming Show will be Cliff Bleszinski, who will no doubt want to talk more about LawBreakers. Their gravity-defying multiplayer shooter is shaping up nicely, so expect them to bring a few features or maybe even a map to share with the PC crowd. Relic Entertainment Not long ago, the first official trailer for Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 3 landed, and it now sits on my short list of the very best trailers of all time. Just look at it. It's ... majestic.
With luck, the cutscenes will come close to matching that kind of cinematic vision of the 40K universe. The gameplay itself looks much more traditional, however, thanks to some early screenshots that accompanied PC Gamer's hands-off preview. Here's hoping a blue-ribbon panel from Relic Entertainment is there for an extended, live gameplay demo, the likes of which were sorely missing from the show last year. There are few franchises that so oversaturate the games market. We've got high hopes for Dawn of War 3 being the flagship digital experience of the Games Workshop classic. Studio Wildcard Ark: Survival Evolved is barely a year old, but it's already mopping the floor with lesser survival games. A nasty lawsuit notwithstanding, the Studio Wildcard team has been churning out new modes and maps like crazy. The most recent release, The Center, is more fantastical than anything yet released and features giant waterfalls, underground forests and all manner of prehistoric beasts.
After a bit of a hiatus, expect co-founder Jesse Rapczak to be on hand to discuss a renewed focus on esports-type "last man standing" events held in partnership with Twitch. TaleWorlds Entertainment Those who've followed PC gaming over the last decade will no doubt remember the Mount & Blade series. Critically and popularly acclaimed for both its melee combat and deep strategic layer, the game was in many ways ahead of its time. Four years ago, the team announced a proper sequel, Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord, and then promptly dropped off the face of the earth. Word is, Bannerlord will have a big unveiling at this year's E3. Even if TaleWorlds isn't anticipating having the big reveal during the PC Gaming show, I expect the studio will have something interesting to share. Torn Banner Studios The team that burst onto the scene with Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is back with a brighter, more magical melee game called Mirage: Arcane Warfare. A playable version was available for fans at PAX East, and our own Brian Crecente had some hands-on time with it. In the original Chivalry, which started out as a Half-Life 2 mod before being recreated and improved using Unreal Engine 3, players warred against one another in a medieval setting using swords, polearms, battleaxes and other weapons of the era. What helped to set the game apart was the precise controls needed to succeed in the game … and the ultra-violence that often ended a clash with lopped off limbs and geysers of blood. Mirage, created with Unreal Engine 4 for Windows PC, will feature the same level of violence, but this time it won't just be the result of melee combat. All six classes in the game use both magic and weapons in battles. Each of the classes has its own style, spells and weapons. You can read their full preview here.
Tripwire Entertainment Rising Storm 2: Vietnam was announced last year, and here's hoping Tripwire Entertainment will have something new and exciting to show at E3. A playable demo of the game traveled to PAX East, but the most recent trailer (shown below) still says the game is in alpha. The graphics and the animations are looking a little dated, so hopefully it gets some love before it goes live.
Yesterday Team Dignitas announced they have parted ways with their CSGO team, and will build their next team in North America.
Today the historically UK-based organisation have explained to Esports News UK the reasoning behind this move.
Michael "ODEE" O'Dell, Team Dignitas President, said: "We intend to be incredibly active in UK player recruitment and competition for all the squads in our Team Dignitas family. We see a bright future for Team Dignitas in CSGO, and are very committed to forming an elite team of the world's best international players.
"We intend to headquarter our CSGO squad in North America so that they may have access to the best training, development, and health and wellness resources we can provide.
"It has been a pleasure to work with such talented players as Rene 'cajunb' Borg, Kristian 'k0nfig' Wienecke, Mathias 'MSL' Lauridsen, Ruben 'rubino' Villarroel, Emil 'Magisk' Reif and Casper 'Ruggah' Due – and I am confident we will compete against them at the highest level in the future."
"We intend to headquarter our CSGO squad in North America so that they may have access to the best training, development, and health and wellness resources we can provide."
Team Dignitas were acquired by US basketball brand the Philadelphia 76ers in September.
Dignitas and the 76ers said in a statement they are committed to building their next 'elite, international CSGO team based in North America with the goal of dominating the global competitive gaming landscape'.
"Team Dignitas aspires to lead the eSports industry in player recruitment and development; we are confident our fans will continue to be excited by our future player and personnel announcements," they added.
Ruggah said in a Twitlonger post that Dignitas offered the players a 'very competitive' deal, but after negotiating the team decided to commit their future elsewhere in esports.
UN children's agency wants £12.6m to help 25,000 children affected by country's severe drought as part of global £1.9bn appeal for 2016
About 25,000 children in North Korea require immediate treatment for malnutrition after a drought cut food production by a fifth and the government reduced rations, Unicef has warned.
The UN's children's fund is asking for £12.6m ($18m) in donations for its North Korea work as part of a global £1.9bn humanitarian appeal for children.
It said the money needed for its work had doubled in three years, driven by global conflicts and extreme weather that were forcing growing numbers of children from their homes and exposing millions more to food shortages, violence, disease and abuse.
For the first time, it said a quarter of the worldwide appeal would go towards educating children in emergencies, focusing on 5 million children affected by the Syrian civil war, which is now in its fifth year.
In North Korea, Unicef said severe drought during 2015 in four agricultural provinces led to a 20% reduction in crop production compared with 2014.
“The impact of this will continue into 2016. Cereal rations were reduced, impacting the nutritional and health status of women and children,” it said in a statement.
International aid appeals for North Korea are often severely underfunded as foreign governments try to pressure Pyongyang to curtail its nuclear ambitions.
Aid workers warn that whenever North Korea conducts nuclear weapon trials – such as the hydrogen bomb test this month – foreign funds dry up. During 2015, Unicef received only 38% of the £15.5m North Korea appeal.

The hermit nation suffered a famine in the 1990s that killed as many as a million people, and the country still relies heavily on foreign aid.
“The severe drought last year reduced food production and children's access to safe, clean water,” Unicef's representative in North Korea, Timothy Schaffter, told the Guardian.
“Without safe water, children are at greater risk of diarrhoea, which is a leading cause of malnutrition and death. We have reports of a 72% increase in diarrhoea among children under five in the most severely drought-affected provinces.
“If we are unable to secure additional funding, our supplies of essential medicines will start running out in March, nutrition supplies will be depleted by mid-year, and our highly successful immunisation programme will run out of basic vaccines before the year's end.”
In its global 2016 appeal, the bulk of the funds sought would provide life-saving aid needed for Syria and the resultant refugee crisis in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, Unicef said.
Yemen's humanitarian crisis leaves a million people in dire straits – in pictures Read more
It called for £126m for children in Yemen, where 10 million children are in urgent need of humanitarian aid, and said it needed £17.9m to help children in Burundi, one of the poorest countries in the world, and where a political crisis has led to street fighting and mass displacement.
About one in nine children worldwide are living in conflict zones, said Unicef which warned of donor fatigue: protracted crises in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sudan were all less than 40% funded in 2015.
“In the past few months I have seen with my own eyes children pushed beyond the boundaries of human suffering in Burundi, north-east Nigeria and along the migrant and refugee route in Europe,” said Afshan Khan, Unicef's director of emergency programmes.
Extreme weather posed a further risk to children. “Climate change, deforestation and the worsening El Niño weather system are pointing to more frequent and intense disasters in 2016, impacting a larger number of children in east Asia and the Pacific,” Unicef regional emergency adviser Carmen van Heese said.
The impact of El Niño in the Pacific islands had caused typhoons and floods, Unicef said. Drought warnings are in force for Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Vanuatu and Palau.
“Children and families are struggling to cope with one of the worst El Niño cycles ever recorded, with more frequent and intense cyclones expected in 2016,” Unicef said, warning of further malnutrition and crop failures.
With R.J. Reynolds going nationwide with its Vuse e-cigarette, and Altria planning to put its own MarkTen on shelves later this year, Big Tobacco is now fully engaged in the electronic cigarette business. That's proof that the Food and Drug Administration waited too long to produce regulations on a fast-growing industry that FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg themselves describes as the “wild, wild West.”
Unfortunately, the proposed regulations announced this spring fail to address some of the problems of inhaling vaporized liquid nicotine, the process behind e-cigarettes. The nicotine vapor is intended to help smokers quit tobacco, but many anti-smoking advocates believe it can have the opposite effect, becoming a gateway to nicotine addiction. While the proposed rules would officially ban sales of e-cigarettes to minors, the FDA would still permit the sale of e-cigarettes in candy and dessert flavors that have been shown to have special attraction to young users. And e-cigarette makers' marketing efforts, aided by celebrity endorsements, are going unhindered. A new study in the journal Pediatrics found that youth exposure to television e-cigarette advertising increased 256 percent between 2011 and 2013. There are no public-health messages to counter the advertising.
And the news about e-cigarettes grows more worrisome: There have been reports of children poisoning themselves by ingesting liquid nicotine, new data indicating that some devices produce carcinogens when too hot, and early data also indicating that e-cigarette users are more likely to remain or become real smokers.

Hamburg said in an interview that the proposed rules were as far as the agency could go for now in establishing regulatory control over a new product. Reuters subsequently reported that the regulations had been weakened by the White House. What's more, they won't even take effect for several months. In the meantime, Massachusetts is among only 11 states not to have regulations of its own. In the last month alone, several states, including neighboring Rhode Island and Connecticut, have passed or enacted bans on the sale of e-cigarettes to minors. Currently, 54 Massachusetts cities and towns including Boston have placed e-cigarettes under the state's smokefree workplace ban, but half the state's population isn't covered. State Representative Jeffrey Sanchez of Boston has filed a bill that would ban sales to minors and prohibit the use of e-cigarettes where regular smoking is banned.
The bill is currently in the Joint Committee on Health Care Financing, where Senate co-chairperson Jim Welch of West Springfield hopes for action before the end of the term. Given the vagaries of the FDA's process, Welch said, “We have to remain vigilant.” The Legislature should approve the bill and, given the FDA's reluctance to act, remain alert to this growing problem.
The Wire is re-circulating this important clarification from the Supreme Court which came a year ago because of the continuing misuse of the term “sedition” and “seditious” in public discourse and police practice around the country
New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday said that all authorities across the country would be bound by the Kedar Nath judgment of the apex court, which limits the scope of filing sedition cases under the provisions of Indian Penal Code.
A bench of Justices Dipak Misra and Uday Lalit gave the direction after Prashant Bhushan appeared on the behalf of the petitioners –NGO Common Cause and S. P. Udayakumar (an anti-nuclear activist against whom sedition charges have been made) – and said that there has been an increase in the number of sedition cases being filed.
Bhushan argued before the bench that the law of sedition is being grossly misused, misapplied and abused by the authorities and that the authorities are not following the judgment in Kedar Nath which states that Section 124A (sedition) is only applicable where there is violence or incitement to violence in the alleged act of sedition.
Taking note of this submission, the bench in a brief order, said “we are of the considered opinion that the authorities while dealing with the offences under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code shall be guided by the principles laid down by the Constitution Bench in Kedar Nath Singh vs. State of Bihar case. Except saying so, we do not intend to deal with any other issue as we are of the considered opinion that it is not necessary to do so. The writ petition is accordingly disposed off.”
The petitioners were concerned at the increasing number of ‘sedition' cases being filed across the country, the latest being the slapping of a charge against Amnesty International India for organising a debate on Kashmir and against Kannada actor-turned-politician, Ramya for their ‘Pakistan is not hell remark,' and challenged this provision in the Indian Penal Code. They said there has been an increase in the number of cases of sedition against intellectuals, activists and students.
The petition was for the Supreme Court to address the misuse and misapplication of IPC Section 124A (sedition law) by the Centre and various state governments, which has led to routine persecution of students, journalists and intellectuals engaged in social activism. It submitted that these charges are framed with a view to instil a fear and to scuttle dissent and are in complete violation of the scope of sedition law as laid down by constitution bench judgment of Supreme Court in Kedar Nath.
In the petition, a prayer was made for the issuance of an appropriate writ, order or direction making it compulsory for the concerned authority to produce a reasoned order from the director general of police or the commissioner of police, as the case maybe, certifying that the “seditious act” would either lead to the incitement of violence or had the tendency or the intention to create public disorder – before an FIR is filed or an arrest is made on the charges of sedition against any individual.
In the various cases that have been filed in recent years, the charges of sedition against the accused have failed to stand up to judicial scrutiny. The petitioner therefore sought strict compliance with the constitution bench judgment of the Supreme Court in Kedar Nath in which the scope of sedition as a penal offence was laid down and it was held that the gist of the offence of sedition is “incitement to violence” or the “tendency or the intention to create public disorder”.
It was submitted that those actions, which do not involve violence or the tendency to create public disorder – such as the organisation of debates/discussions, drawing of cartoons and criticism of the government – do not constitute sedition.
Section 124A of the IPC states “whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the government established by law in India shall be punished with imprisonment for life to which fine may be added or with imprisonment which may extend to three years.”
The petitioners regretted that more than 50 years since the Kedar Nath judgment, Section 124A of the IPC was being allowed to be used irrespective of whether the alleged act or words are, in fact, seditious acts, or constituting a “tendency to cause public disorder or incitement to violence”.
In carrying out arrests and slapping charges, the police and the governments have rarely, if ever, respected this restriction. Successive governments have blatantly used Section 124A to stifle the voice of dissent and to further their political goals.
Quoting statistics, they said, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report of 2014, as many as 47 sedition cases were reported across nine Indian states in 2014 alone. Many of these cases did not involve violence or incitement to violence, which is a pre-requisite for a sedition charge. It was submitted that as per NCRB figures, a total of 58 people were arrested in connection with these cases, but the government managed only one conviction.
It said that in 1979, India ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which sets forth internationally recognised standards for the protection of freedom of expression. However, misuse of sedition law under Section 124A and the arbitrary slapping of charges continue to restrict speech in ways that are inconsistent with the ICCPR.
In the Kedar Nath judgment, the apex court unequivocally narrowed the scope of Section 124A, but it continues to be misused, thereby making it imperative for this court to issue necessary directions and guidelines to uphold its decision in Kedar Nath which is also compatible with India's international obligations.
The petitioner acknowledges that words which directly provoke violence, or which directly threaten the maintenance of public order, may deserve censure. However, that is not what the misapplication of sedition law seeks to achieve. The present practice of misapplication of sedition law violates the Kedar Nath judgment. It further aims to crush all opposition to the ruling political party. The regular use of the law continues to have a chilling effect on the freedom of speech and expression in the country.
It was submitted that though a small number of sedition cases lead to actual conviction, it causes harassment of individuals till the time judgment comes, which in various cases takes several years.
Meanwhile, individuals charged with sedition have to live without their passport, are barred from government jobs and must produce themselves in court at all times as and when required. A person who is charged also has to spend money on legal fees.
The charges have rarely stuck in most of the cases, but the process itself becomes the punishment. The petitioners prayed for a review of all pending sedition cases and for criminal complaints for sedition made before a judicial magistrate with a view to curb the misuse and misapplication of the sedition law.
Tankers!
The E 25 is a superb tank destroyer with unusual gameplay, preferential matchmaking, and the usual Premium vehicle benefits. The result was this deadly German TD gaining sizable popularity among the player base. But this popularity means that the total number of E 25s being used is steadily increasing, which leads to an increase of imbalanced battles among its tier scope.
Therefore, rather than put the E 25 through drastic rebalancing, we made the difficult decision to gradually withdraw the vehicle from sales, and grant it the status of an exclusive Premium vehicle -- just like the Type 59, KV-5, and several others. Given that, we won't rule out the possibility of the E 25 returning to the Premium Shop in a special event or as a reward for in-game competitions.
The withdrawal of the E 25 will occur in two stages: First, it will be removed from the tech tree and in-game store on December 22. Later, on January 15, it will be removed from the Premium Shop. Naturally, everyone who bought or buys the vehicle before these dates can keep and continue to play it. And again, these decisions aren't easy, but consider this a chance to get a memorable tank destroyer before it bows out!

CLOSE Sen. Bernie Sanders discusses their campaign's success and the challenges they face going forward. USA TODAY

ROCK HILL, S.C. -- The sudden ascendancy of Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign has stunned even the Vermont independent himself.
Four months after they announced their bid for the Democratic nomination, Sanders is drawing huge crowds, leading polls and unexpectedly shaking up the race as support for their economic populist message threatens the powerhouse operation of former secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Once dismissed as a long shot, Sanders is now focused on the challenges of branching out beyond those early voting states and connecting with African-American and Hispanic voters. For two decades, they have represented the small, mostly white state of Vermont.
Sanders made their second trip as a candidate this weekend to South Carolina, the first southern primary state where he'll face a Democratic primary electorate that will be largely African-American. Clinton enjoys long-standing support and name recognition there while Sanders is relatively unknown.
“We have an agenda that makes sense to all Americans, but to be honest with you, it makes more sense for the African American community because of the economic problems facing that community in terms of higher unemployment, lower wages, a harder time sending their kids to college,” Sanders said Saturday. “I believe once the African-American community becomes familiar with it, there will be a lot of support.”
Sanders held three public events in South Carolina including a town hall meeting in Columbia at the historically black Benedict College. In Florence, S.C., they also held a town hall and met privately with about 50 mostly black leaders and elected officials, many of whom went into the meeting thinking they were committed to Clinton, said author and civil rights activist Cornel West, who joined Sanders for the events. “It's clear that they are rethinking their position,” West said. “I think that we're going to be in for some surprises in the black community in South Carolina.”
West is a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement that disrupted two of Sanders' earlier campaign events with protests, but they said those disruptions should stop as people get to know Sanders' commitment to racial justice. Since they formally announced their campaign in May, Sanders has increased their focus on such issues and the need to combat poverty among African Americans.
Benedict first-year student Dajana Baker, 19, of Greenville, S.C., said it's important that Sanders continue to discuss issues involving race. “If we continue to ignore that in this country, it's just creating denial and deceit,” said Baker, who is undecided on who they will support in 2016.
People who say they're fed up with income inequality also have been drawn to Sanders' proposals to help poor and middle-class Americans, such as providing free college tuition at public schools, creating jobs with infrastructure investments and raising the federal minimum wage to $15-an-hour.
Becky Morton, 60, of Charlotte, was among about 3,000 who attended a rally at Winthrop University in nearby Rock Hill, S.C., on Saturday. They said jobs and social safety net issues are their concerns after being laid off by a major air carrier three months ago. “He's probably far more to the left than I've ever been,” said Morton. “But … at least he's pulling the conversation back to where I think the Democratic Party should be. Whether they have a chance at the nomination, that's an open question.”
A CBS News/YouGov poll, released Sunday, showed Sanders leads Clinton by 10 percentage points in Iowa and 22 percentage points in New Hampshire, neighbor to Vermont. The poll showed 23% of South Carolina's likely Democratic voters supported Sanders, compared to 46% for Clinton and 22% for Vice President Joe Biden, who has not entered the race. A Public Policy Polling survey of South Carolina Democratic voters released Sept. 9 showed only 9% supported Sanders.
Scott Huffmon, director of the Winthrop Poll, said Sanders' difficulty is that their rallies have been drawing attendees who are predominantly white and young when black voters are likely to make up more than half of the Democratic primary electorate in the Palmetto state. “He needs to make themselves known to this group that's going to be absolutely critical,” they said.
Rep. Jim Clyburn, the state's only Democrat in Congress, said they expect Clinton to sweep South Carolina – under present conditions. Clinton, who came in second in the 2008 South Carolina primary, has lined up support from dozens of mayors and community officials along with two former governors.
But Clyburn said the race here could be impacted greatly by outcomes in Iowa and New Hampshire, whether Vice President Joe Biden enters the race, and Clinton's Oct. 22 congressional testimony on their role leading up to the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya. “A lot depends on how that hearing comes out,” said Clyburn, who won't endorse a candidate until after the primary. “That could impact everything.”
Sanders plans to open more offices in South Carolina. But he's also planning to invest in staff and look into advertising in Super Tuesday states and beyond. They scheduled events on Sunday in North Carolina and on Monday in Virginia, including a speech at the evangelical Christian Liberty University.
“We are now preparing for a full national campaign that goes beyond the first four states and given the enthusiasm that I am seeing as I go around this country, to be honest with you, we are feeling very, very good about where we are,” they said.

Bitcoin tumbling, also referred to as Bitcoin mixing or Bitcoin laundering, is the process of using a third party service to break the connection between a Bitcoin address sending coins and the address(s) they are sent to. Since the Bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger that records every transaction, mixing coins is critical for anyone who doesn't want the entire world to know exactly where they send and store their BTC, or from where they receive it.
Properly mixing coins may seem like a daunting task to those who aren't very familiar with Bitcoin, but it is actually a simple process that will only take a few minutes of your time for each deposit.
There are good reasons for everyone to mix their coins, but for those who use Darknet Markets in particular, it is a necessity. New tools are being built all the time to increase the ability of the public, as well as private corporations and government agencies, to follow coins through the blockchain and track those who use it. It may seem like a waste of time now, but in the near future it may be simple for anyone- including friends, relatives, employers, and law enforcement, to track every Bitcoin transaction you've ever made and see exactly where it ended up. Breaking the connection between your addresses and the coins' destination by mixing them is certainly a precaution that all DNM users should take.
In this guide we attempt to provide the simplest possible step-by-step instructions to help users unfamiliar with the process of Bitcoin tumbling do so effectively. This guide assumes the reader already has a basic understand of how to send Bitcoins and how to use .onion sites.
To mix your coins using this method, you will need:
-Bitcoins, or the ability to buy them.
-The Tor Browser
-The ability to create new Bitcoin wallets, both via Tor and on the clear net. We recommended using Electrum, but any client that functions over Tor will work. Alternately, you could use Blockchain.info and their Tor hidden service to create all or some of your wallets.
NOTE: Always make sure you get the .onion link for this and every hidden service from a safe place (like Darknetmarkets.org), never from Wikipedia, Reddit, or Hidden Wikis! Also make sure that you never use the blockchain.info clearnet url over Tor; doing that opens you up another possible vulnerability (malicious tor exit nodes). A good place to make sure you are using the correct URL is from our Darknet Resources page.
The Steps
Step #1: Create a wallet on the clearnet. (We will refer to this as wallet #1)
Step #2: Buy Bitcoins, and send the amount you want to mix to wallet #1.
Step #3: Create a second wallet, this time over the Tor network. (wallet #2)
Step #4: Send your bitcoins from wallet #1 directly to wallet #2.
The reason for this is to add plausible dependability between your clearnet wallet and in-person purchases. If you are ever investigated by law enforcement or the company from which you are buying coins (this happens with Coinbase.com especially), you can reasonably claim that you sent them to someone else who controls wallet #2 (for whatever made-up reason you have in mind as your excuse for your BTC purchase). After that you have no idea/don't care what that person did with them, nor should anyone expect you to.
Step #5: Create a third wallet, also over the Tor network. (wallet #3).
Step #6: Select which mixer you will be using, and set up your transaction there using the address(s) from wallet #3. It is best to use multiple addresses, and to set random time delays.
ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING THE CORRECT .ONION LINKS!
Scams are rampant everywhere online, and the darknet is no different. You can choose your mixer(s) and get the correct URLs from our list of darknet Bitcoin mixers.
We recommend Helix by Grams first, and then Bitcoin Blender, as the two seemingly best in a group of imperfect options. They have both been extremely reliable so far while processing millions of dollars. DO NOT use blockchain.info's shared send or any other coinjoin product as your mixer, as those do not completely hide your trail like the others.
Helix Grams .onion URL: http://grams7eu3phkfrt3.onion/helix/light/
Bitcoin Blender URL: http://bitblendnlwdwxiy.onion
NOTE: Turn off JavaScript before doing this step if you are using Helix, Bitcoin Blender, or other mixers that function without it. (Click on the “S!” icon before the address bar in the Tor browser, then >Forbid Scripts Globally”.)
Unfortunately Bitmixer still requires users have JavaScript enabled.
Save the “Letter of Guarantee” if you are using Bitmixer. If you are using Helix, save the URL it sends you to after you enter your address(s). Make a backup of these, or your login details for the other mixers.
Step #7: Send the coins from wallet #2, over Tor, to the address generated for you by the mixer.
Step #8: Assuming these coins are going to be sent to a darknet market… if you don't already have your deposit address, log in and get it while having JavaScript disabled. Never use any market that requires you to enable JS!
Step #9: You can use Blockchain.info's Tor hidden service to watch for your coins to arrive from the mixer. Once they have, restart Tor and then send the coins to your market address (or their eventually destination)!
The reason you should create an extra wallet in between your mixer and market account, is in case you ever run in to any type of problem with your account (lost password, hacked/phished, lost PGP key, etc), you can use the fact that you control all of the recent deposit address as proof that you are the rightful owner of this account.
You should also create a wallet you control in between any coins you may ever withdrawal from a market and a mixer. This is far more important than the reverse, in case the market takes a long time to put your deposit through (which happens, trust me). Mixers only keep track of the addresses it generates for you for a set amount of time, usually between 6 and 24 hours. If you initiate a withdrawal from a market directly to a mixer's bitcoin address, and the market runs into problems and doesn't send your withdrawal for 48 hours, you face a very real risk of the mixer not forwarding your coins. This would not be the mixer's fault, as they are open about how they work. They purge records every X hours for privacy.
TIP: You can use Blockchain.info's taint analysis to make sure that no trace remains between wallet #2 and wallet #3. Access it like this, replacing 1YOURBITCOINADDRESS (in blue) with yours:
https://blockchainbdgpzk.onion/taint/1YOURBITCOINADDRESS
Search this page for your address(s) from wallet #2. If they aren't there, you've successfully performed a zero-taint mix of your Bitcoins! If an address from wallet #2 does show up, there is a problem with the mixer you are using, you should contact them and/or use a different one in the future.
The only weakness remaining is the fact that the mixing company has records of your transactions, and although they all claim to delete them shortly after the transaction is complete, it is possible they could have a trail of where your coins went. You can negate this risk by repeating the process with a second mixing service.
I probably made this sound more complicated than it actually is. In total it should only take about 10-15 minutes, and it is something worth doing if you value your privacy and want to make sure you never lose any coins!
As with anything, you should do your research before using Bitcoin tumbling services and use the ones with the best reviews and highest levels of trust. The tumblers we list as trusted have been around for some time and have had no verifiable complaints against them. The other services listed are either newer, have been hacked, or have had numerous complaints against them. We do not link to mixers that are scams, or that do not function as advertised.

Obtaining a college degree isn't cheap for many students or their parents. Are you planning on starting college soon? If so, you may be interested in finding ways to cut your educational costs and student loans, while still getting the degree you need.
Why Study Abroad?
Are you looking for ways to get a solid education, explore the world and stay on budget? Some students found that they can achieve all three goals by attending college overseas. With rising tuition costs, students and their parents are looking for ways to reduce college expenses.
One reason students can save money overseas is that the time required for a degree can be less than what is common in the United States. For example, students attending many colleges outside of the United States can earn a bachelor's degree in three years instead of four.
This can mean significant savings for families. Depending on the university, students may be able to obtain a degree without learning a foreign language. Not to be overlooked, though, is the opportunity to be immersed in another culture and to gain a global perspective. Students may want to hone their language skills abroad. If you're looking into internationally-based careers, an education in a new country can give you an advantage when you graduate.
College Tuition Costs Overseas
Believe it or not, tuition costs overseas are comparable to some out-of-state tuition that public universities charge. Families are required to check for scholarships or stipends available for international students. If not, they may have to apply for federal student loans. You may find that the shorter degree schedule still puts you ahead compared to obtaining a degree from an American college, depending on what you're looking for.
For instance, one student was looking at saving 4 years by pursuing a law degree in England. They estimated that it would've been over $90,000 to attend their school of choice in the United States. That's not even counting the 3-year J.D. program.
Of course, with looking overseas, you have to make sure that graduate programs abroad, and your degree, is recognized in your field. Studying with an accredited university is important. Check the credentials of all the schools you're looking into before applying for admission.
Finding Scholarships to Study Abroad
What if you're currently a college student looking to study abroad for a semester or a year? There are scholarships to choose from; check with your university's financial aid department, your major's department head's office and sites like Fastweb to see what you can qualify for.
You can also refer with the overseas college you'd like to attend and contact their offices to see what they can offer in terms of financial aid. Perhaps you can also join a work study program, allowing you to earn a bit while you're out of the country.
Your thoughts on this topic are important. How many of you are considering studying overseas, either for your entire education or just a semester? What majors are you looking at obtaining? Where do you want to attend?

Overnight the media propaganda wars escalated after the late Friday release of an article by the Washington Post (which last week admitted to using unverified, or fake, news in an attempt to smear other so-called “fake news” sites) according to which a secret CIA assessment found that Russia sought to tip last month's U.S. presidential election in Donald Trump's favor, a conclusion presented without any actual evidence, and which drew an extraordinary, and angry rebuke from the president-elect's camp.
“These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,” Trump's transition team said, launching a broadside against the spy agency. “The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It's now time to move on and ‘Make America Great Again.' ”
The Washington Post report comes after outgoing President Barack Obama ordered a review of all cyberattacks that took place during the 2016 election cycle, amid growing calls from Congress for more information on the extent of Russian interference in the campaign. The newspaper cited officials briefed on the matter as saying that individuals with connections to Moscow provided WikiLeaks with email hacked from the Democratic National Committee, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign chief and others.
Without a shred of evidence provided, and despite Wikileaks' own on the record denial that the source of the emails was Russian, the WaPo attack piece claims the email messages were steadily leaked out via WikiLeaks in the months before the election, damaging Clinton's White House run. Essentially, according to the WaPo, the Russians' aim was to help Donald Trump win and not just undermine the U.S. electoral process, hinting at a counter-Hillary intent on the side of Putin.
“It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia's goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected,” the newspaper quoted a senior U.S. official briefed on an intelligence presentation last week to key senators as saying. “That's the consensus view.”
CIA agents told the lawmakers it was “quite clear” – although it was not reported exactly what made it “clear” – that electing Trump was Russia's goal, according to officials who spoke to the Post, citing growing evidence from multiple sources.
And yet, key questions remain unanswered, and the CIA's report fell short of being a formal U.S. assessment produced by all 17 intelligence agencies the newspaper said, for two reasons. As we reported in November “The “Fact” That 17 Intelligence Agencies Confirmed Russia is Behind the Email Hacks Isn't Actually…A “Fact“, and then also because aside from so-called “consensus”, there is – once again – no evidence, otherwise the appropriate agencies would have long since released it, and this is nothing more than another propaganda attempt to build tension with Russia. In fact, the WaPo admits as much in the following text, which effectively destroys the article's entire argument :
The CIA presentation to senators about Russia's intentions fell short of a formal U.S. assessment produced by all 17 intelligence agencies. A senior U.S. official said there were minor disagreements among intelligence officials about the agency's assessment, in part because some questions remain unanswered. For example, intelligence agencies do not have specific intelligence showing officials in the Kremlin “directing” the identified individuals to pass the Democratic emails to WikiLeaks, a second senior U.S. official said. Those actors, according to the official, were “one step” removed from the Russian government, rather than government employees. Moscow has in the past used middlemen to participate in sensitive intelligence operations so it has plausible deniability. * * *
“I'll be the first one to come out and point at Russia if there's clear evidence, but there is no clear evidence — even now,”said Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chairperson of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the Trump transition team. “There's a lot of innuendo, lots of circumstantial evidence, that's it.”
And since even the WaPo is forced to admit that intelligence agents don't have the proof that Russian officials directed the identified individuals to supply WikiLeaks with the hacked Democratic emails, the best it can do is speculate based on circumstantial inferences, especially since, as noted above, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has denied links with Russia's government, putting the burden of proof on the side of those who challenge the Wikileaks narrative. So far that proof has not been provided.
Nonetheless, at the White House, Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said Obama called for the cyberattacks review earlier this week to ensure “the integrity of our elections.”
“This report will dig into this pattern of malicious cyberactivity timed to our elections, take stock of our defensive capabilities and capture lessons learned to make sure that we brief members of Congress and stakeholders as appropriate,” Schultz said.
Taking the absurdity to a whole new level, Obama wants the report completed before their term ends on January 20, by none other than a proven and confirmed liar: “The review will be led by James Clapper, the outgoing director of national intelligence, officials said.” In other words, the report that the Kremlin stole the election should be prepared by the time Trump is expected to be sworn in.
“We are going to make public as much as we can,” the spokesperson added. “This is a major priority for the president.”
The move comes after Democrats in Congress pressed the White House to reveal details, to Congress or to the public, of Russian hacking and disinformation in the election.
On Oct. 7, one month before the election, the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence announced that “the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.” “These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process,” they said.
Trump dismissed those findings in an interview published Wednesday by Time magazine for its “Person of the Year” award. Asked if the intelligence was politicized, Trump answered: “I think so.”
“I don't believe they interfered,” they said. “It could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in their home in New Jersey.”
Worried that Trump will sweep the issue under the rug after their inauguration, seven Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee called on Nov. 29 for the White House to declassify what it knows about Russian interference. The seven have already been briefed on the classified details, suggesting they believe there is more information the public should know. On Tuesday this week, leading House Democrats called on Obama to give members of the entire Congress a classified briefing on Russian interference, from hacking to the spreading of fake news stories to mislead U.S. voters.
Republicans in Congress have also promised hearings into Russian activities once the new administration comes in.
Obama's homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco said the cyberinterference goes back to the 2008 presidential race, when both the Obama and John McCain campaigns were hit by malicious computer intrusions.
* * *
An interesting aside to emerge from last night's hit piece and the Trump team response is that there is now a full blown turf war between Trump and the CIA, as NBC's Chuck Todd observed in a series of late Friday tweets:
The implication in the Trump transition statement is that they don't believe a single thing from the CIA. — Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) December 10, 2016
Is the next Commander-in-Chief is signaling that the CIA won't be a major player in their national security team? — Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) December 10, 2016
So stunned by the Trump transition statement on the Post-CIA-Russia story that I half expect a walk back by tomorrow — Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) December 10, 2016
How helpful is it for the CIA's reputation around the world if the next US questions their findings so publicly? Good luck Mike Pompeo — Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) December 10, 2016
To which Glenn Greenwald provided the best counterargument:
Yes, the CIA's sterling reputation around the world for truth-telling and integrity might be sullied if someone doubts their claims… https://t.co/2uyQXvFdOK — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) December 10, 2016
When is it hardest to get people not to blindly accept anonymous, evidence-free CIA claims? When it's very pleasing to believe them. — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) December 10, 2016
However, of the mini Tweetstorm, this was the most important aspect: the veiled suggestion that in addition to Russia, both the FBI and the Obama presidency prevented Hillary from becoming the next US president…\
While Obama's FBI director smeared Hillary, Obama sat on evidence of Russian efforts to elect Trump that had basis in evidence. — Franklin Foer (@FranklinFoer) December 10, 2016
… which in light of these stunning new unproven and baseless allegations, they may very well have renewed aspirations toward.
* * *
So while there is no “there” there following the WaPo's latest attempt to fan the rarging fires of evidence-free propaganda, or as the WaPo itself would say “fake news”, here is why the story has dramatic implications. First, the only two quotes which matter:
“…there is no clear evidence — even now,” said Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chairperson of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the Trump transition team. “There's a lot of innuendo, lots of circumstantial evidence, that's it.” * * * “…Obama wants the report before they leave office Jan. 20, Monaco said. The review will be led by [PROVEN LIAR] James Clapper, the outgoing director of national intelligence, officials said.”
And then the summary:
Announce “consensus” (not unanimous) “conclusion” based in circumstantial evidence now, before the Electoral College vote, then write a report with actual details due by Jan 20. Put a proven liar in charge of writing the report on Russian hacking. Fail to mention that not one of the leaked DNC or Podesta emails has been shown to be inauthentic. So the supposed Russian hacking simply revealed truth about Hillary, DNC, and MSM collusion and corruption. Fail to mention that if hacking was done by or for US government to stop Hillary, blaming the Russians would be the most likely disinformation used by US agencies. Expect every pro-Hillary lapdog journalist – which is virtually all of them – in America will hyperventilate (Twitter is currently on fire) about this latest fact-free, anti-Trump political stunt for the next nine days.
Or, as a reader put it, this is a soft coup attempt by leaders of Intel community and Obama Admin to influence the Electoral College vote, similar to the 1960s novel “Seven Days in May.”

Merah, who was shot dead on Thursday at the end of a 32-hour police siege in Toulouse, was believed to be responsible for a killing spree in the city and in nearby Montauban that left seven people dead, including three children.
Authorities had reported early on that Merah was believed to have worn a video camera as they carried out the killings.
According to Le Parisien, the package bore a postmark dated March 21, or the day Merah was cornered by police. The newspaper said investigators were working to determine if the package was mailed by Merah themselves on Tuesday evening March 20 or by an accomplice on the morning of March 21.
According to Reuters, a "source close to the investigation" said the video comprised a montage and audio of Islamist war songs.
An al-Jazeera employee confirmed this account, according to Reuters.

Merah told police they had been inspired by al-Qaida and admitted to killing three Jewish children, three soldiers and a rabbi, according to Reuters.

Tom Begaye Jr., 28, from Waterflow, New Mexico, agreed to spend the rest of their life in prison Tuesday in Albuquerque.
In under one hour, Begaye entered a guilty plea to luring Ashlynne Mike and their brother Ian Mike into their van, then taking them to the Shiprock pinnacle where they sexually assaulted, then brutally murdered the 11-year-old girl.
Begaye stood in shackles and a red jumpsuit before U.S. Judge William Johnson Tuesday afternoon at the Pete V. Domenici U.S. Courthouse. They never made eye contact with Pamela Foster and Gary Mike, parents of Ashlynne.
Johnson asked them a series of questions if they agreed to their plea agreement, which Begaye replied “yes” to.
The first five counts – one count of first-degree murder, one count of felony murder, one count of kidnapping resulting in death, two counts of aggravated sexual abuse resulting in death – carry a lifetime sentence without the possibility of parole, Johnson said. The one count of kidnapping of a minor carried a 20-year to life sentence.
As Johnson read off the gruesome details of what Begaye did, the Mike family, who had been silent during the proceeding, could not hold back their tears.
Ashlynne Mike's father, Gary, spoke outside the courthouse after the hearing and said it was time they and their family “get off and do something about it” as their family members stood by him.
“It's been full of emotions,” Mike said of what their life has been like since their daughter's murder. “There are days when I couldn't get up. There have been days when we didn't even want to talk to anyone. There are days when we'd hear from our children and bring us back to our reality and our love for our other children.”
No date has been set for when Begaye will be sentenced, but will be within the next 90 days, Mike said.

Jesse Worley threatened to sue Microsoft. He's not the first to take on the Redmond company, but their move to take legal action had a purpose. They wanted Microsoft to acknowledge that aggressively pushing the Windows 10 update was a problem. Customers weary of the Windows 8 disaster were unwilling to take the upgrade leap; Microsoft was, they reasoned, ignoring their fear of heights.
Worley built a Windows 7 machine for their grandfather, who has Alzheimer's Disease, in 2013. Because of this, Worley customized the machine to look like Windows XP, an operating system their grandfather still remembered well. Since Windows 7 will still receive patches until 2020, they wanted to keep the machine on Windows 7 until they got around to building a PC with Windows 10, using the fake Windows XP interface.
But thanks to Microsoft's persistent Windows 10 upgrade program, Worley's grandfather unknowingly initiated the Win 10 upgrade by clicking the “X” to close an upgrade window – which gave permission by not explicitly refuting the update. For the last 21 years, that X has been used to close programs in Windows. Microsoft chose to change that function.
It didn't turn out well.
A surprising upgrade
“Surely I'm not the only one to face surprise updates, or to spend time and money fixing them,” Worley said in email correspondence with Digital Trends. “Microsoft's culpability most certainly isn't limited to those suffering from Alzheimer's Disease or their families either. I'm not a litigious person, and one of the things I dislike most are people taking a sort of perverse profit from the suffering of others.”
“I'm an IT tech whose grandfather's computer was updated through subterfuge, which made life harder for them and their caretakers until it was fixed.”
Many customers weary of the Windows 8 disaster were unwilling to take the upgrade leap. Microsoft seemingly ignored their resistance.
With Windows 10, Microsoft fixed the mistakes made in Windows 8 by bringing the desktop interface back to the forefront, while retaining the app-based structure. The result is a combined environment with the benefits of a tablet-like experience spicing up the desktop we've come to rely on for decades.
It's a great operating system, but Windows 10 is not without issue. Privacy advocates dislike it, as Microsoft collects data such as voice input, text input, website history, and more. There are ways to limit the personal information Microsoft receives, but these steps likely aren't known by the average Joe. The growing privacy concerns have called out security experts, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and even France's National Data Protection Commission.
Is this data-mining the fuel that powered Microsoft's aggressive Windows 10 upgrade program?
“The tactics Microsoft employed to get users of earlier versions of Windows to upgrade to Windows 10 went from annoying to downright malicious,” the EFF said in August. “Some highlights: Microsoft installed an app in users' system trays advertising the free upgrade to Windows 10. The app couldn't be easily hidden or removed, but some enterprising users figured out a way. Then, the company kept changing the app and bundling it into various security patches, creating a cat-and-mouse game to uninstall it.”
Change isn't always for the best
Aside from the privacy issues, many people simply don't want to jump on the Windows 10 bandwagon. Most holdouts rely on Windows 7, which is currently the most-used operating system on the market. Many don't like the Windows Store, Cortana, or the tweaked Start Menu. Others simply need their PC to function the same as it always has, for various reasons.
For Jesse Worley and their grandfather, a familiar OS was a must-have. The change from a simulated Windows XP environment to Windows 10 was disrupting, and cost time and money to undo the damage. As Worley pointed out in their email, he's likely not the only one who suffered from Microsoft's seemingly malicious upgrade scheme.

“I'm just the IT tech, so I fought my fight,” they said. “I don't want to say that because my grandparents suffered, now I understand personally how someone with Alzheimer's Disease — or bad eyesight, or a small monitor, or who was conditioned to repeatedly press ‘no' to the GWX popup, or any of a million other reasons for not clicking the fine print in GWX and de-scheduling the update — personally suffered.”
When they threatened Microsoft over the Windows 10 upgrade, they wrote the company a letter of their intent as requested in Microsoft's EULA for Windows 10, which states that “we hope you'll mail a Notice of Dispute and give us 60 days to try to work it out, but you don't have to before going to small claims court.” (The company even provides a Notice of Dispute form.)
Surprisingly, Microsoft has admitted that the upgrade pop-up window was misleading, and customers who faced the Windows 10 upgrade beast and failed can strike back. Worley did so and received $650. They wanted Microsoft to pay them for their time and donate to any Alzheimer's charity, but the company only agreed to pay for their time, given that Microsoft donates to charities already.
Worley took the money and donated it to alz.org.
Customers should come together
Ultimately, Worley hopes people impacted by the forced Windows 10 upgrade will write a complaint to Microsoft demanding a settlement for their wasted time and money in repairing the device. They want Microsoft to vow it will never use an aggressive promotion again, and for the victims to donate their rewards to Alzheimer's research if they don't need the money “in case Microsoft doesn't take the hint.”
Microsoft admitted the upgrade pop-up window was misleading.
“I want those people to fight their fight,” they said. “I know they can win those fights. Some of them are big fights that cost a lot of money, and some, like mine, are little fights worth less money.”
Worley isn't the only individual who has gone after Microsoft over its Windows 10 upgrade tactics. California travel agent Teri Goldstein sued Microsoft in small claims court in June and won $10,000. They didn't authorize the update, and the installation failed. After that their computer, which they use to manage their business, was unusable. Microsoft couldn't fix the PC, so they went to small claims court instead.
Microsoft appealed the court's decision, which compensated Goldstein for replacing the PC and lost wages. But the company reportedly dropped its appeal so it wouldn't have the expense of continuing the litigation. The whole story can be read in Goldstein's ebook “Winning Against Windows 10: How I Fought Microsoft and Won.”
“Teri and I both believe that legislation which criminalizes software companies that use aggressive or misleading tactics to trick their own users into dangerous updates is necessary,” Worley said. “While we might take separate approaches toward accomplishing that shared goal in California and Texas, we know that this fight would be significantly easier with Microsoft reps at the table as opposed to sticking their fingers in their ears and writing checks against their ethical shortcomings.”
Updates are a part of software, and they usually result in better, more stable, more secure software. But companies should be upfront with them rather than slipping updates in on the sly. Microsoft's efforts to force upgrades to Windows 10 shows that aggressive updates can indeed go too far, and is a rare example of users getting relief for a PC that suddenly breaks – through no fault of their own.
Five years ago, LCD Soundsystem held their own funeral at Madison Square Garden. After a 10-year run, which included the release of three critically acclaimed studio albums, James Murphy disbanded their popular band with a massive three-hour farewell concert at the world's most famous arena.
Murphy said they no longer found enjoyment in the current format of LCD Soundsystem. The rigors of recording and touring prevented them from exploring other passions, such as film scoring and writing. In the years since the band's breakup, Murphy launched a campaign to soundtrack New York City's subway system and designed their own soundsystem called Despacio. They opened their own bar and restaurant. They produced records for Arcade Fire and Yeah Yeah Yeahs.
Why then is Murphy deciding to get the band back together, and why now? Sources tell Consequence of Sound that the impetus for LCD Soundsystem's decision to reunite so soon after their highly publicized farewell came thanks to a lucrative, multi-million dollar offer from AEG Live.
Aside from the financial return, AEG's offer provided LCD Soundsystem the chance to headline one of America's most prestigious music festivals in Coachella, along with AEG's other Los Angeles festival, the fast-rising FYF Fest, which takes place next August.
AEG also intended to have LCD Soundsystem headline its planned New York City festival, Panorama, which was to take place in June. However, those plans hit a snag when AEG failed to secure the proper permits. While AEG still hopes to stage Panorama at some point in 2016, the band is now planning its own headlining concert in New York City later this year.
Since receiving the initial offer from AEG, LCD Soundsystem have signed on to headline several other prominent music festivals across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe.
Update – Monday, January 4th at 10:05 p.m. CT: LCD Soundsystem have been officially announced as Coachella 2016 headliners. Additionally, the band's website now says “2016 tour dates coming soon.”
LCD Soundsystem's reunion has already brought the release of one new song, “Christmas Will Break Your Heart”. In an accompanying note, Murphy said the band recorded the song in New York City over the course of two weeks. As it stands now, the band plans to record and release more music in the near future.
Some will undoubtedly question Murphy's motives to reunite LCD Soundsystem, and understandably so. The band's breakup was a multi-year spectacle. Not only did it include the Madison Square Garden farewell, but the following year the band released a documentary chronicling the concert. They followed that up in April 2014 by releasing a live album of the show.
However, in Murphy's defense, they never did close the door on a possible comeback. When announcing the band's initial breakup in 2010, they suggested the possibility of a reunion down the road: “It's not like some big, dramatic ending — we've talked about if in five years we'd want to play again, we'd do it.”
A representative for LCD Soundsystem declined to comment. Representatives for AEG did not respond to our request for comment.
Government ministers from European states, who met in Paris today in the wake of the atrocious attacks that stunned the French capital's population last week, have called on internet firms to do a better job of cooperating with spooks and police to help them fight terrorism.
In a joint statement (PDF) from a number of Europe's interior ministers including France's Bernard Cazeneuve and Britain's Home Secretary Theresa May, the politicians said:
We are concerned at the increasingly frequent use of the internet to fuel hatred and violence and signal our determination to ensure that the internet is not abused to this end, while safeguarding that it remains, in scrupulous observance of fundamental freedoms, a forum for free expression, in full respect of the law. With this in mind, the partnership of the major internet providers is essential to create the conditions of a swift reporting of material that aims to incite hatred and terror and the condition of its removing, where appropriate/possible.
The missive followed a march attended, not only by the politicos, but also by millions of French citizens in a show of democratic defiance against the terrorist acts, which started at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo when 12 people were murdered last Wednesday. It was signed in the presence of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.
But privacy warriors were quick to hit out at the proposals on Sunday.
3m people march in Paris for freedom of expression, and 13 govts announce plans for Internet censorship without due process #CharlieDoesSurf — Caspar Bowden (@CasparBowden) January 11, 2015
Tory MP and former Secretary of State for Defence Dr Liam Fox, meanwhile, took to the pages of the Sunday Telegraph today to lobby for more powers for the UK's spies. They argued:
In 1993, there were only 130 websites in the world. By the end of 2012 there were 654 million – a lot of haystacks in which terrorist needles can hide. That is why our security services need to be given access to the data they require to help to keep us safe. It is also why the appalling misjudgement of those such as the Guardian newspaper in helping Edward Snowden, now residing with the Russian secret service in Moscow, is so unforgivable. When Snowden took data to China and Russia, some 58,000 files came from GCHQ, information that had played a vital role in preventing terrorism in Britain over the past decade.
Separately, the U.S. administration confirmed it would convene a meeting on 18 February to discuss tackling the global fight against Islamic extremism.
The take-away from politicians on both sides of the pond today, once you set aside the posturing about freedom of expression: demands for greater surveillance of citizens' movements online are back on the agenda in a big way. ®
One of the few moments of unrivaled joy last week was seeing Nazi punching bag/national laughing stock Richard Spencer not only get kicked out of CPAC — America's annual gathering of the cruelest and least empathetic conservatives — but also got quickly shut down and told to fuck off by their favorite band, Depeche Mode, after trying to proclaim them "the official band of the alt-right."
As one might expect from the band who had a Top 15 hit in the U.S. with "People Are People" in 1984, Martin Gore, Dave Gahan and Andy Fletcher went to the media to disassociate themselves and their music from the fascist and racist social movements which would erroneously take a martial, synthetic drum beat as an endorsement of an ideology built on the racism of odious trolls.
Additionally, the band's new single "Where's the Revolution" is defiantly political and forthright in exhorting listeners to reject the authoritarian powers currently wreaking havoc throughout the world. And DM's forthcoming albumpromises to find Basildon, U.K.,'s finest kicking out the jams as only they can.
So when Depeche's Global Spirit Tour lands at Ascend Amphitheater on Sept. 18, it'll be the band's first Music City appearance since a famously under-attended 1988 Tour for the Masses stop at the sorely missed Starwood Amphitheater.
It will be a day of joy for those who have never stopped appreciating the ongoing evolution of what started out as synth-pop, gradually added guitars and drums, and continues growing into something all the more glorious with each new step.
Tickets go on sale next Friday, March 10, at 10 a.m., right here.
