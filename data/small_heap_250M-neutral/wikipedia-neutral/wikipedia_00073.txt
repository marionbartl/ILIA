At age 15, Lee turned down an offer from Sony Hong Kong to join the short-lived girl group Ris-K. Eager to explore their Chinese roots and to see the world, in 2002, Lee joined another group called NRG performing in Hong Kong. When the SARS outbreak hit China, Lee returned home to focus on their solo career.
Lee aligned with Vancouver-based Hipjoint Production, and achieved "indy-cred" with their debut album What a Difference a Day Makes.

The Heartland Museum of Military Vehicles (HMMV) in Lexington, Nebraska, is a non-profit organization run by volunteers and funded by donations and grants. The museum's goal is to restore, preserve and display historic military equipment of all types, as a way to honor those who served. It is located near exit 237 of Interstate 80. There is no entry fee; donations are optional. It is open from 10 am - 5 pm Monday-Saturday, and 1 pm - 5 pm on Sundays.
History
In 1986, armed only with a determination to preserve historic military vehicles, four Lexington men formed the Heartland Museum. Today the dozens of fully restored vehicles are dedicated in honor and memory of those who served.
In 1991, a permanent site for the museum was obtained at exit 237 of Interstate 80. In 1998, a Visitor Center was constructed which houses many of the vehicles.
Collection
The museum has about 100 vehicles including helicopters, tanks, half-tracks, ambulances, and a jeep from every branch of the service. There are also displays of weapons, uniforms, engines, equipment, and more. The everyday necessities of a soldier's life, such as MREs, blend with unique vehicles, like those used by the German army in World War II.
Staff are very helpful and will tell you just about everything to know about each vehicle at the site. One of the attractions is the prototype HMMWV, serial number 1. Children can explore the interior of a Mike model Huey helicopter, and two tanks.

Gay Wilson Allen (August 23, 1903 — August 6, 1995) was an American academic and writer. After holding assistant and associate professorships between the late 1920s to mid 1930s, Allen was hired by Bowling Green University in 1935 as an associate professor. Upon leaving for New York University in 1946, Allen was an English professor until 1969. Apart from working as a visiting scholar until the late 1970s, Allen was on a literary trip with William Faulkner that was sponsored by the United States Department of State during 1955.
As an author, Allen primarily focused on Walt Whitman with their writings between the early 1940s to late 1990s. Of their Whitman works, Allen was a lead editor on The Collected Writings of Walt Whitman, which was released in twenty two books. For their biographies, some of their subjects included Whitman, William James, Ralph Waldo Emerson and J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur. With The Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt Whitman, Allen was nominated for the 1956 National Book Award for Nonfiction. For Waldo Emerson: A Biography, Allen was nominated for the 1982 Pulitzer Prize for Biography and won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Biography the same year. Allen received two Guggenheim Fellowships in the 1950s and became part of the New Jersey Literary Hall of Fame in 1983.
Early life and education
On August 23, 1903, Allen was born in Lake Junaluska, North Carolina. During their childhood, Allen lived in the Canton, North Carolina neighborhood. Allen was hired by The Canton Chronicle in their teenage years and was a newspaper reporter. For their post-secondary education, Allen attended Duke University in the 1920s and the University of Wisconsin in the 1930s.
Career
Literary
Early writing and Whitman
Allen worked as a potato farmer during their childhood. While farming, Allen used a typewriter to create an essay about an opossum for their literary debut during the mid 1910s. In 1988, Allen said "[if he] had bought a microscope, [he] might have turned out to be a scientist" instead. Between the 1930s to 1980s, Allen primarily wrote about Walt Whitman.
For their career on Whitman, Allen started out with the 1943 publication of Twenty-Five Years of Walt Whitman Bibliography: 1918-1942. In 1946, Allen released Walt Whitman Handbook. With their publication, Allen said they wanted to provide "a better, more correct interpretation" about Whitman while teaching at New York University. During updates in 1975 and 1986, their handbook was renamed to the New Walt Whitman Handbook. In later publications, multiple of their Whitman works were re-released as re-edited or expanded versions. These included Walt Whitman in 1969 and Aspects of Walt Whitman in 1977.
In 1955, Allen began a multi-book project on works by Whitman for New York University Press. While Allen worked as one of the lead editors on The Collected Writings of Walt Whitman, their collection was completed in 1984 after twenty two books. In 1990, Allen started to remake Walt Whitman Abroad with Ed Folsom, which was originally released in 1955. During the proofreading stage, Allen died before the book was to be republished as Walt Whitman and the World. Walt Whitman and the World was posthumously released in 1996.
Biographies and other works
In 1949, Allen started working on their Whitman biography and took seven years before they published the book. The Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt Whitman was published in 1955 before the 100th anniversary of the release of Leaves of Grass by Whitman. In 1967, Allen released a biography about William James.
At the start of the 1970s, Allen wrote a biography about Herman Melville and a pamphlet on Carl Sandburg. For their 1980s biographies, Allen published a book about Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1981. Allen and Roger Asselineau released their biography on J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur, titled St. John be Crèveccouer: The Life of an American Farmer, in 1987. Apart from biographies, Allen wrote about Korney Chukovsky and Charles E. Feinberg during the late 1980s.
Academic
In a 1991 essay, Allen said they "had not planned an academic career...as a teacher of American literature". Allen began their English teaching experience in 1929 at Lake Erie College as an assistant professor before continuing for a year with Alabama Polytechnic Institute in 1931. In 1934, they became an associate professor for Shurtleff College. After joining Bowling Green State University in 1935, they remained there until they were hired by New York University in 1946. Allen continued their academic career at New York until 1969.
For these two universities, Allen worked as an associate professor for Bowling Green and an English professor for New York. In 1969, Allen held their academic position at New York as an emeritus. As a visiting scholar between the late 1960s to late 1970s, Allen was hired by Harvard University and Emory University. Additional academic institutions Allen worked for included the University of Texas and the University of Hawaii. Outside of the United States, Allen taught in Japan with William Faulkner during a 1955 literary trip sponsored by the United States Department of State.
Writing process and reception
For The Solitary Singer, Allen and their wife co-created the manuscript and conducted research at a storage facility owned by the Brooklyn Eagle. Allen additionally consulted over a thousand publications on Whitman during the research stage. Allen rewrote their draft multiple times prior to the release of their book on Whitman. While conducting research for William James: A Biography, Allen used private letters from the James family. They also created a smaller teaching version of their James biography for schools.
When Ralph L. Rusk released their 1949 publication Life of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Allen believed it was "weak on the intimate, personal life". For Waldo Emerson, A Biography, Allen included information that was not included in the Emerson biography written by Rusk. To write their biography on Emerson, Allen used thousands of unpublished letters. In a review by The Philadelphia Inquirer, David R. Contosta said Allen and Asselineau had included inaccuracies on the 18th century while providing a historical background in their Crèvecœur biography.
Awards and honors
During their teens, Allen received an essay collection of Emerson works for their opossum essay. Allen was given a Guggenheim Fellowship for American literature in 1952 and 1959. In 1956, Allen was nominated for the National Book Award for Nonfiction in 1956 with The Solitary Singer. In 1969, Edwin Haviland Miller announced they would release The Artistic Legacy of Walt Whitman: A Tribute to Gay Wilson Allen before it was published the following year. In 1977, Allen was chosen as a recipient for an American literature award from the Modern Language Association.
Allen received the James Russell Lowell Prize from the MLA for Waldo Emerson: A Biography in 1981. In 1982, Allen won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Biography with Waldo Emerson: A Biography. That year, Waldo Emerson was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Biography. After the National Book Awards were replaced with the American Book Awards, Waldo Emerson was a 1982 nominee in the Autobiography/Biography category for hardcover books. Allen became part of the New Jersey Literary Hall of Fame in 1983.
Personal life and death
In 1988, Allen left Oradell to live in Raleigh, North Carolina. They died there on August 6, 1995 from pneumonia. Allen was previously married and had no children.

The Triballi () were an ancient tribe whose dominion was around the plains of modern southern Serbia, northern part of North Macedonia and western Bulgaria, at the Angrus and Brongus (the South and West Morava) and the Iskar River, roughly centered where Serbia and Bulgaria are joined.
The Triballi were a Thracian tribe that received influences from Celts, Scythians and Illyrians.
History
The written sources on the Triballi are scarce but the archaeological remains are abundant. The scientific research of the Triballi was boosted with Fanula Papazoglu's book The Central Balkan Tribes in Pre-Roman Times (1968 in Serbia, 1978 in English). Other historians and archaeologists who wrote on the Triballi include , Dragoslav Srejović, Nikola Tasić, Rastko Vasić, Miloš Jevtić and, especially, Milorad Stojić (Tribali u arheologiji i istorijskim izvorima, 2017).
Based on the archaeological findings, the history of the Triballi can be divided in four periods: Proto-Triballian (1300–800 BC), Early Triballian (800-600 BC), Triballian (600–335 BC) and period from 335 BC until Roman conquest.
In 424 BC, they were attacked by Sitalkes, king of the Odrysae, who was defeated and lost their lives in the engagement. They were pushed to the east by the invading Autariatae, an Illyrian tribe; the date of this event is uncertain.
In 376 BC, a large band of Triballi under King Hales crossed Mount Haemus and advanced as far as Abdera; they had backing from Maroneia and were preparing to besiege the city when Chabrias appeared off the coast, with the Athenian fleet, and organized a reconciliation.
In 339 BC, when Philip II of Macedon was returning from their expedition against the Scythians, the Triballi refused to allow them to pass the Haemus unless they received a share of the booty. Hostilities took place, in which Philip was defeated and wounded by a spear in their right thigh, but the Triballi appear to have been subsequently subdued by him.
After the death of Philip, Alexander the Great passed through the lands of the Odrysians in 335-334 BC, crossed the Haemus ranges and after three encounters (Battle of Haemus, Battle at Lyginus River, Battle at Peuce Island) defeated and drove the Triballians to the junction of the Lyginus at the Danube. 3,000 Triballi were killed, the rest fled. Their king Syrmus (eponymous to Roman Sirmium) took refuge on the Danubian island of Peukê, where most of the remnants of the defeated Thracians were exiled. The successful Macedonian attacks terrorized the tribes around the Danube; the autonomous Thracian tribes sent tributes for peace, Alexander was satisfied with their operations and accepted peace because of their greater wars in Asia.
They were attacked by Autariatae and Celts in 295 BC.
The punishment inflicted by Ptolemy Keraunos on the Getae, however, induced the Triballi to sue for peace. About 279 BC, a host of Gauls (Scordisci) under Cerethrius defeated the Triballi with an army of 3,000 horsemen and 15,000 foot soldiers. The defeat pushed the Triballi further to the east. Nevertheless, they continued to cause trouble to the Roman governors of Macedonia for fifty years (135 BC–84 BC).
The Illyrian Dardani tribe settled in the southwest of the Triballi area in 87 BC. The Thracian place names survive the Romanization of the region.
Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD) registers them as one of the tribes of Moesia.
In the time of Ptolemy (90–168 AD), their territory was limited to the district between the Ciabrus (Tzibritza) and Utus (Vit) rivers, part of what is now Bulgaria; their chief town was Oescus.
Under Tiberius, mention is made of Triballia in Moesia; and the Emperor Maximinus Thrax (reigned 235–237) had been a commander of a squadron of Triballi. The name occurs for the last time during the reign of Diocletian, who dates a letter from Triballis.
Legacy
Exonym of Serbs
The term "Triballians" appears frequently in Byzantine and other European works of the Middle Ages, referring to Serbs, as the Byzantines sought to create an ancient name for the Serbs. Some of these authors clearly explain that "Triballian" is synonym to "Serbian". For example, Niketas Choniates (or Acominatus, 1155–1215 or-16) in their history about Emperor Ioannes Komnenos: "... Shortly after this, they campaigned against the nation of Triballians (whom someone may call Serbians as well) ..." or the much later Demetrios Chalkondyles (1423–1511), referring to an Islamized Christian noble: "... This Mahmud, son of Michael, is Triballian, which means Serbian, by their mother, and Greek by their father." or Mehmed the Conqueror when referring to the plundering of Serbia.
Mihailo Vojislavljević succeeded as Knez of "Duklja" in 1046, or as their realm was called by contemporary Cedrenus: "Triballorum ac Serborum principatum". According to George Kedrenos (fl. 1050s) and John Skylitzes (fl. 1057), they were the Prince of Triballians and Serbs (Τριβαλλών και Σέρβων...αρχηγός/ Τριβαλλῶν καὶ Σέρβων...ἀρχηγός).
In the 15th century, a coat of arms of "Tribalia", depicting a wild boar with an arrow pierced through the head (see Boars in heraldry), appeared in the supposed Coat of Arms of Emperor Stefan Dušan 'the Mighty' (r. 1331–1355). The motif had, in 1415, been used as the Coat of Arms of the Serbian Despotate and is recalled in one of Stefan Lazarević's personal Seals, according to the paper Сабор у Констанци. Pavao Ritter Vitezović also depicts "Triballia" with the same motif in 1701 and Hristofor Zhefarovich again in 1741.
Marin Barleti (1450–1513), wrote in their biography of Skanderbeg (published between 1508–10), that father of Skanderbeg's mother Voisava was a "Triballian nobleman" (pater nobilissimus Triballorum princeps). In another chapter, when talking about the inhabitants of Upper Debar that defended Svetigrad, they call them "Bulgarians or Triballi" (Bulgari sive Tribali habitant).
With the beginning of the First Serbian Uprising, the Parliament adopted the Serbian Coat of Arms in 1805, their official seal depicted the heraldic emblems of Serbia and Tribalia.
Even though the two names were used as synonyms by some Byzantine sources and certain heraldic inheritance, Serbian official historiography does not equalate the Serbs and the Triballi, nor does it fabricate a cultural continuity between the two.
Tribals and Tribalia are often identified in a historical context with Serbs and Serbia, as these interpretations refer only to Laonikos Chalkokondyles of the 15th century, who often resorted to archaisms in their historical writings that have come down to us (Mizi, Illyrians, etc.) to indicate the subjects of the individual rulers, without attaching ethnic meaning to their content.
Romanian geographic name
In Romania, "Tribalia" refers to the Timok Valley region split between Serbia and Bulgaria in which a Romanian population lives.
Archaeological findings
Bulgaria
A male grave at Vratsa, with a female Thracian suttee. Dated to the 4th century BC, the royal tomb contains beautiful goldwork, like pitchers and wreaths.
Serbia
Archeological findings prove that the Triballi inhabited the Morava Valley (Great Morava and South Morava) region in the Iron Age.
In 2005, several possibly Triballi graves were found at the Hisar Hill in Leskovac, southeastern Serbia.
In June 2008, a Triballi grave was found together with ceramics (urns) in Požarevac, central-eastern Serbia.

The Bartlett Western Railroad, sometimes called the Bartlett Western Railway, was a shortline rail carrier running between Bartlett, Texas and Florence, Texas, about 22-23 miles. A predecessor company started in 1909, and the railroad ended in 1935.
History
Founded in 1909, the aptly-named Bartlett Florence Railway was created to run from a rail connection with the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad at Bartlett to the town of Florence, which was a significant cotton processing center having multiple cotton gins. However, the company only got as far as Jarrell, Texas, being 11 or 12 miles. Nevertheless, the railroad was important enough that it killed the town of Corn Hill, Texas. When the line bypassed Corn Hill by a mile, and Jarrell was established alongside the rails, all of the people and most of the buildings of Corn Hill were relocated to Jarrell.
The line was purchased May 29, 1911 at a foreclosure sale by a group of Texas business people, and on June 17, 1911 they incorporated the Bartlett Western Railroad. They completed the line to Florence, 22 or 23 miles in length, on December 27, 1911.
Initially, business was good. In 1912 the railway carried 53,750 tons of cotton—its primary commodity—and in 1916 with one locomotive (a Baldwin 2-6-0 Mogul steam engine), eighteen freight cars, two passenger cars, and eight company cars, made $30,327 in freight revenue plus about one-eighth of that in passenger revenue.
In 1916 the line was purchased by Colonel Thomas Cronin, known as a pioneer in railroading circles for their work on the International and Great Northern Railroad. They moved to Bartlett and employed their family members in the company, including making their colorful daughter Marie a Vice President.
Under the Colonel, the railroad adopted a religious theme. Cotton pickup stations between Bartlett and Florence were named St. Matthew (Schwertner), St. Mark (Jarrell), St. Luke (Atkinson community), and St. John (Armstrong community). Copies of the Gospels were posted on the station walls as reading material. Accordingly, the line acquired nicknames such as the Road of the Apostles and the Four Gospels Railroad.
Over time the line accumulated some more negative nicknames. Some called it the Bullfrog Line, because the trains jumped the track so often. Because the line would sometimes request the passengers to not only get off the train to help the overburdened locomotive get up the grade between Bartlett and Florence, but also to help push it over the hump, some said its initials BW stood for Better Walk.
The railroad started encountering severe problems. It was not able to obtain financing to extend the line to connect with the Santa Fe Railway at Lampasas, Texas. Floods washed out bridges and trestles in the 1920-1922 timeframe. In 1926, cotton prices plummeted, hurting cotton haulage revenue. And in 1927 the Colonel died. However, the railroad was taken over by daughter Marie, who persevered for several more years.
However, the route was finally abandoned on October 11, 1935. Marie sold the rails, and with the proceeds managed to live at a reasonably comfortable level until their death in 1951.

The Fourth Executive was, under the terms of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, a power-sharing coalition.
Following the 6 May 2016 elections to the fifth Northern Ireland Assembly, the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Féin remained the two largest parties in the Assembly.
Notably for the first time in the assembly's history, parties entitled to seats on the executive could instead opt to go into formal opposition. The UUP, SDLP and Alliance all took up this option, leaving the DUP and Sinn Féin to form a government.
The 4th Northern Ireland Executive was formed on 25 May 2016. It lasted less than a year, and collapsed on 16 January 2017 following the resignation of deputy First Minister McGuinness in protest at the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal.

The bar-winged prinia (Prinia familiaris) is a species of bird in the cisticola family Cisticolidae. The species is sometimes known as the bar-winged wren-warbler.
Description
The bar-winged prinia is a distinctive prinia, long and weighing .
Distribution and habitat
It is endemic to Indonesia, where it occurs on the islands of Sumatra (where it occurs on the east of the island), Java and Bali. It occupies a wide range of habitats, from mangrove forest at sea level to montane forest, and is tolerant of human modified environments such as gardens, parks and plantations. The presence of humans within its range is common and its willingness to adapt to the subsequent modified landscapes means it is not threatened with extinction.
Behaviour
The bar-winged prinia feeds on insects.

Maurandya barclayana (syn. Asarina barclayana; orth. var. M. barclaiana), commonly called angels trumpet or Mexican viper, is an ornamental plant in the family Plantaginaceae native to Mexico. Growing to in height, this herbaceous perennial climber has ivy-like leaves and white, pink or purple tubular flowers. As it does not tolerate being frozen, in temperate climates it is often grown under glass in a conservatory, or alternatively as a tender annual. It requires a sheltered position in full sun. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Alberto Tomba (born 19 December 1966 in San Lazzaro di Savena) is a former World Cup alpine ski racer from Italy. They were the dominant technical skier (slalom and giant slalom) in the late 1980s and 1990s. At 182 cm and 90 kg, their powerful build was a contrast to the lighter, more traditional technical skiers who prioritised agility over muscle. Tomba was able to take advantage of the introduction of spring-loaded ski gates which replaced the older, solid gates in the early 1980s by using their power to maintain a faster, more direct line through courses. Tomba won three Olympic gold medals, two World Championships, and nine World Cup season titles: four in slalom, four in giant slalom, and one overall title. They were popularly called Tomba la Bomba ("Tomba the Bomb").
Early years
Alberto Tomba was born in Bologna and raised in Castel de Britti, a village in the municipality of San Lazzaro di Savena – an area without strong alpine traditions, but not far from the appenninic piste of Monte Cimone and Corno alle Scale. Their father Franco, a business person in the textile industry, had been a keen skier since attending college in Switzerland and passed their love of the sport to their sons, driving Alberto and their older brother Marco from their home to Sestola so they could ski. Alberto learned to ski at the age of three and started racing at the age of seven. As a child, they participated in sports like tennis, football, and dirt biking, but they found that their greatest passion was for skiing. Later in life, in 1988, their father Franco promised them a Ferrari if they won a gold medal that year and, as they celebrated their first gold at the bottom of the slope, Alberto told their father and everyone else who was watching on TV that they wanted the car to be red.
In 1984 they took part in the Junior World Championships, where a fourth-place finish won them a position on the national B team. That year, in an exhibition parallel slalom competition in San Siro, Milan, they surprised everyone by beating every member of the A team. After three wins on the Europa Cup circuit, Tomba made their World Cup debut in December 1985 at Madonna di Campiglio, Italy, three days before their nineteenth birthday. Two months later, in Åre, Sweden, they surprised the skiing world by finishing sixth from a bib number of 62. Their first podium came the following season in Alta Badia, Italy in December 1986, and later that winter they won bronze in the giant slalom at the 1987 World Championships in Crans-Montana, Switzerland - the only medal won by the Italian team at that World Championships.
Rise to fame
On 27 November 1987, Tomba scored their first World Cup victory, in a slalom at Sestriere, Italy. Two days later they won the giant slalom, beating their idol, Ingemar Stenmark. It was now clear that Tomba was a force to be reckoned with within the alpine skiing world.
They went on to win nine races that 1988 season, including a slalom win at Madonna di Campiglio where they beat the second-placed finisher by 1.34 seconds, shouting "I am the new messiah of skiing!" as they crossed the finish line. They won that year's World Cup titles in both slalom and giant slalom, but was runner-up in the overall standings to Pirmin Zurbriggen of Switzerland. During this early part of their career, Tomba also competed in super G, an event they would continue to contest until 1989, despite never finishing better than fourth.
At the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Tomba won gold medals in slalom and giant slalom. In the first run of the GS, they finished an impressive 1.14 seconds ahead of their nearest competitor. "Tomba la Bomba" ("Tomba the Bomb"), as they were known, also earned some notoriety by asking out East German figure skater Katarina Witt, whom they met again later on.
Tomba was not as successful in the following two seasons, winning a total of four World Cup races. At the 1989 World Championships in Vail, Colorado, they could do no better than sixth place in the super G and seventh in the giant slalom. From 1989 to the end of their career, Tomba was surrounded by their own technical staff managed by former Olympic champion Gustav Thöni and strength and conditioning coach Giorgio d'Urbano, who worked with them for ten seasons.
Tomba was temporarily put out of action in 1990 when they crashed in a World Cup race in Val-d'Isère, breaking their collarbone. However, in the 1991 season, Tomba returned to their winning ways, winning the giant slalom World Cup title for a second time while finishing fourth in the slalom standings. They ended 4th in slalom at the 1991 World Championships at Saalbach-Hinterglemm (Austria) and crashed in the second giant slalom run after having clocked the fastest time in the first leg, handing the victory to Austria's Rudolf Nierlich, the two-time winner at Vail, Colorado, two years earlier. In September 1991, they also met former Miss Italy, Martina Colombari, whom they dated for several years.
Tomba's career reached its second peak during the 1992 season with nine victories and fifteen podiums, and they once again captured the season-long discipline titles in both their technical specialties. Their duel with Paul Accola for the overall World Cup crown extended until the very end of the season and the Finals at Crans-Montana, but the Swiss skier scoring points in all disciplines including downhill and combined ultimately prevailed. At the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, Tomba won what was to be their last gold medal at Val d'Isère, in the giant slalom, and picked up a silver in the slalom. In Val d'Isère, they became the first alpine champion to successfully defend an Olympic title when they won the giant slalom ahead of Marc Girardelli.
The 1993 World Championships, held in Morioka, Japan, again proved to be their nemesis. Tomba was suffering from a fever during the giant slalom and made a critical mistake in the slalom, failing to reach the podium in either race. To make matters worse, they only managed to win a single World Cup race in the entire 1993 season.
Overall World Cup champion
Tomba was back to their usual ways at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. After their slalom run, they were seemingly out of medal contention, (placed 12th) 1.84 seconds behind leader Thomas Stangassinger (and 1.00 behind place 3, Peter Roth), but in the second run they recovered to second place and won the silver medal.
It soon became apparent that the 1995 World Cup season would be their best yet. From December 1994 to March 1995, they amassed an impressive 11 victories in the technical events including seven in a row in slalom to finally capture the overall World Cup title that had eluded them in years past and bringing the Crystal Globe back to Italy, twenty years after Gustav Thöni's last title in 1975.
At the 1996 World Championships, Tomba finally added the final missing pieces to their trophy case, winning two gold medals at Sierra Nevada, Spain. Their GS victory came thanks to a second-run rally from 0.81 seconds behind.
After the 1996 World Championships, Tomba began contemplating retirement. They decided to come back for one more World Championship, held in 1997 on their home snow in Sestriere. They were disqualified in the giant slalom and had a disappointing first run in the slalom, but an excellent second run was good enough for their last major medal, a bronze. They decided to continue competing for one more year.
Tomba's performance at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano was a sign that their career was winding to a close: for the first time in their Olympic career, they failed to medal after crashing in giant slalom. They suffered a painful injury and was not able to start in the second slalom run after losing much time in the first leg.
Alberto Tomba retired at the end of the 1998 season, but not before winning a last World Cup race at the Finals at Crans-Montana where they grabbed the slalom, becoming the only alpine male skier to have won at least one World Cup race per year for 11 consecutive seasons.
Later in life
After retiring from competitions, Tomba made numerous appearances on Italian television broadcasts, and in 2000 they made their acting debut in the crime film Alex l'ariete, directed by Damiano Damiani; the movie, however, was met with little success and was unanimously panned by movie critics.
At the 2006 Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony in Turin, Tomba brought the Olympic Flame into the stadium where they handed it off to the men's 4 × 10 km gold medalists from the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer (De Zolt, Albarello, Vanzetta, Fauner). During the 2010 edition of "Sport Movies & TV - Milano International FICTS Fest" they were awarded with "Excellence Guirlande D'Honneur" and entered in the FICTS "Hall of Fame".
Today, they say they like sleeping and is passionate about automatic car washes where they like to go at night when there's no queue.

[[Image:Agents of Law 01.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cover of the first issue]]Agents of Law was a series published by Dark Horse Comics in 1995.
It followed the story of Law, a powerful individual of dubious motives who took over Golden City after the events of Will to Power, which was the big event of the in-house Dark Horse line of superhero comics during the summer of 1994. It was a continuation of Catalyst: Agents of Change''.
Despite massive hype by the publishing company prior to its release the series ultimately failed to survive the withering market of the time and the choice by Dark Horse to scale back their line of superhero comics, which had only recently been renamed.
Law was the first super villain to ever be killed by a Predator. See the last page of issue #6.

On 25 December 2010, at least 47 people were killed and over 100 others injured, after a female suicide bomber detonated their explosives in a large crowd of people displaced by fighting, who were collecting food at a distribution centre of the World Food Programme in the Pakistani town of Khar, which is located within the Bajaur tribal region, of north-western Pakistan. It was later reported by witnesses, that the bomber dressed in a full-length burka had reportedly thrown a grenade after resisting search, to which then the bomber proceeded to detonate their explosives. Several police officials confirmed the bomber was a woman, as opposed to the more likely occurrence of a man wearing the burka as a disguise, in order to successfully conduct this suicide attack. It was also known that those in this crowd were predominantly displaced members of the Salarzai Tribe, which has supported Pakistan Army operations against the Pakistani Taliban within the Bajaur tribal regions. Those dozens of people injured in this suicide attack were apparently later taken to local hospitals via means of helicopters. Local Witnesses, including that of a government official at the main government hospital within the region, Dosti Rehman, claimed that they had personally counted some 40 bodies. However, there are concerns that the death toll could very likely rise, as the official stated that several of those injured, as a result of this suicide attack were apparently in a critical condition at the local hospitals. This particular bombing acts as one of a string of recent suicide attacks, which have occurred with near impunity, predominantly throughout Pakistan's north-western, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, of north-western Pakistan. No particular militant group has of yet claimed responsibility for this suicide attack, although the Pakistani Taliban are strong suspects. The Bajaur tribal region has reportedly seen several Pakistan Army military operations in recent years, however such suicide attacks still continue throughout the region with near impunity. The Pakistani Prime Minister, Yousaf Raza Gillani later condemned this suicide attack, and claimed that such military offensives would continue against the Pakistani Taliban. This statement will be met with a certain degree of approval in the U.S., as Pakistan has recently been pressured to launch a major ground-offensive in the nearby North Waziristan tribal region, in order to root-out and destroy the last major remaining safe-haven for Radical Islamist and Pakistani Taliban insurgents within the country. The UN World Food Programme later suspended its food distribution activities in the Bajaur tribal region, as a security precaution to this suicide attack. This suicide bombing was strongly condemned by U.S. president, Barack Obama. The Pakistani Taliban later claimed responsibility for this suicide attack. This suicide bombing was officially declared the first such suicide attack to involve a female in Pakistan.

Daniel Joseph Conners (February 6, 1942 – April 28, 2019) was a college and professional American Football player who played 11 seasons as linebacker for the American Football League's Oakland Raiders from 1964 through 1969, and for the Raiders in the National Football League (NFL) from 1970 through 1974, including Super Bowl II vs. the Packers.
They played college football at the University of Miami and is enshrined in their Hall of Fame.
Early years
Born in Clearfield Florida, Conners was raised in St. Marys, Pennsylvania, and was a 1959 graduate of St. Marys high school. They led the Flying Dutchmen to undefeated seasons in 1957 and 1958 as a fullback and center while also earning varsity letters in wrestling and baseball.
That got the attention of the University of Miami (Fla.) where Conners began their college career as a center on the first-year student team. They then moved to offensive tackle and then started to make a significant impact on the defensive side of the ball at tackle.
The eventual University of Miami Hall of Famer was 6-foot-2, 240 pounds by their senior year and broke the season record for tackles at that time with 57 tackles and 38 assists in 1962. In 1963, Conners was named an All-American defensive tackle.
Pro career
In the spring of 1964, Conners was drafted twice — by the Chicago Bears in the fifth round (70th pick) in the NFL draft and by the Raiders in the second round (15th overall) of the AFL or American Football League draft.
Conners signed with the Raiders and started an 11-year career that continued through 1974. Conners moved to middle linebacker and helped anchor the defensive unit that helped lead the team to the playoffs in seven of their 11 seasons, 13 games in all.
In 1967, Conners and the Raiders reached the Super Bowl after going 13–1 in the AFL and beating the Houston Oilers, 40–7, for the league title as Conners had a fumble recovery. Against the powerful NFL champion Green Bay Packers in the second-ever Super Bowl, the Raiders lost 33–14.
The next year, the Raiders reached the AFL title game before losing to the eventual Super Bowl champion New York Jets, 27–23. During the regular season, Conners played in the infamous "Heidi Bowl" where the Raiders scored two touchdowns in the final minute of a 43–32 win. However, NBC pre-empted the fantastic finish to go to its regular-scheduled feature film Heidi, causing predictable outrage.
The Raiders reached the AFL title game again in 1969 and lost to another eventual Super Bowl champion, this time hated rival Kansas City, 17–7. Conners recovered a fumble in the loss. In 1970, after the merger of the NFL and AFL, the Raiders lost the American Football Conference championship game 17–7 to the Baltimore Colts, again the eventual Super Bowl champion.
Oakland missed the playoffs in 1971 and reached the postseason again in 1972, winning the AFC West with a 10-3-1 record. In the first round of the playoffs, the Raiders locked up with an emerging power and arch-rival in the Pittsburgh Steelers at Three Rivers Stadium. In what was dubbed the Immaculate Reception game, it was Conners and the Raiders losing 13–7 on the final play of the game when Franco Harris grabbed a deflected pass out of the air and rambled into the end zone for the miracle finish. The Steelers wound up losing to the eventual unbeaten Super Bowl champion Miami Dolphins the next week.
Back again in 1973, the Raiders won the AFC West, avenged the loss to the Steelers in the first round of the playoffs, and lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Dolphins in the conference final, 27–10.
Conners' final season of 1974 saw the Raiders win the AFC West once again with a 12–2 mark, the best record in the NFL. After beating the defending champion Dolphins 28–26 in the first round in the famous "Sea of Hands" game, the Raiders lost at home to another eventual Super Bowl champion as the Steelers, down 10-3 going into the fourth quarter, outscored the Raiders 21–3 in the final quarter to win 24–13. The Steelers went on to win their first Super Bowl, beating the Vikings, 16–6.
Conners appeared in 141 games with the Raiders, 110 of them as a starter. While tackles weren't considered an official statistic until much later, Conners had 15 interceptions, returning three of them for touchdowns, and they recovered 16 fumbles, returning two for scores.
Conners made several postseason All-Pro teams, mostly during a stretch from 1967 through 1969. They were a second-team all-AFL pick in 1967 by the Associated Press, United Press International and The Sporting News. In 1968, they earned first-team All-AFL honors by UPI and Pro Football Weekly and second-team by the AP. In 1969, they were a first-team All-AFL pick by The Sporting News and second-team by the AP.
Conners was named as one of the six linebackers on the AFL Hall of Fame All-1960 Team, joining the likes of Bobby Bell, Nick Buoniconti, George Webster, Larry Grantham, and Mike Stratton. The Chiefs' Bell and the Dolphins' Buoniconti are Pro Football Hall of Famers.
In Conners' 11 seasons, the Raiders won seven division titles and compiled a 105-38-11 regular-season record (.718 winning percentage). They were a foundational piece of the Raiders' defense over that period. Two years after they retired, the Raiders won their first Super Bowl title against the Vikings in 1976.
Later years
After their retirement, Conners remained in football as an assistant coach for the San Francisco 49ers and as a scout for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before returning to the Raiders organization as a scout. Upon retiring from the organization after 25 years, they lived in the San Luis Obispo area, frequenting McCarthy's Irish Pub and the local Elk's Lodge on a daily basis. They died on April 28, 2019, at the age of 77.

Rompetrol is a crude oil development, producer, and refiner based in Romania. It also markets and distributes refined petroleum products through its chain of gasoline and diesel fuel stations. Established as a state-owned company in 1974, it was privatized in 1993 and became a subsidiary of KMG International in 2007. It has operations in 12 countries, where it is known as The Rompetrol Group N.V.
History
Rompetrol was established in 1974 as the operator of the Romanian oil industry.
The company was privatized in 1993 through a Management and Employee Buyout (MEBO), and turnover subsequently reduced to below $6 million by 1998. In 1998, Rompetrol was purchased by a local investor group led by Dinu Patriciu, thus increasing company capital and contributing into a substantial turnover growth. In 1999, the company's new holding was established as The Rompetrol Group N.V.(TRG) in the Netherlands. The new group made its first major acquisition: Vega refinery - located in Ploieşti - which doubled its revenues in the first nine months after takeover.
In 2000, Rompetrol took over Petros (renamed Rompetrol Well Services), then Romania's principal oilfield operator. The Group's largest acquisition, Petromidia S.A., was also Romania's largest and most sophisticated oil refinery. Rompetrol committed itself to a sustained modernization process to make Petromidia a state-of-the-art facility in Eastern and Central Europe. In 2001, Rompetrol created Rominserv S.A., Romania's first Engineering Procurement Construction & Maintenance (EPCM) company focused on the oil industry. In 2002, the Petromedia refinery resumed its petrochemicals production under the management of the newly-founded Rompetrol Petrochemicals.
In 2002, Rompetrol opened subsidiaries in neighboring Moldova (Rompetrol Moldova) and Bulgaria (Rompetrol Bulgaria). The following year, in Romania, Rompetrol started to expand its gas station network. As part of its strategy, the company unified the quality standards for its entire gas station network. To expand its network and make the process of distributing fuel easier, Rompetrol created a network of oil depots in various regions of the country (Arad, Craiova, Șimleu Silvaniei, Zarnesti, Vatra-Dornei, Constanta, Mogosoaia). In 2004, Rompetrol Rafinare S.A. was listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BVB). In 2005, Rompetrol started operations in Georgia and announced the acquisition of 100% of the French company Dyneff S.A. In 2006, Rompetrol opened a subsidiary in Ukraine (Rompetrol Ukraine).
In August 2007, the Kazakh company KazMunayGas acquired 75% of the Rompetrol shares from Rompetrol Holding Switzerland, and the remaining 25% stake in Rompetrol in 2009. In 2008, Rompetrol and KazMunayGas launched Media Marine Terminal for crude oil in the Media Black Sea port. In August 2009, Rompetrol opened its first two fuel stations on the A2 motorway in Romania, designed as the new premium brand of the group
In 2009, the company decided to outsource its IT needs but contracted only a single outsourcer with a multimillion dollar deal. In 2010-2011, Rompetrol was established in Turkey (RG Petrol A.S.). The Petromidia refinery modernization process was completed in 2012 following an investment of US$380 million. A new filling station concept was launched in 2013.
In 2014, the Rompetrol Group N.V. was renamed into KMG International N.V. as part of a strategy to promote the brand KazMunayGas. Although the name was changed into KMG International, the Rompetrol brand continues to be used in the distribution segment of the entire company. The company's retail network that operates under the “Rompetrol” brand incorporates over 1,100 fuel distribution points in Romania, Georgia, Bulgaria, Moldova, in France and Spain, where the company operates also under Dyneff brand.
In 2015-2016, CEFC China Energy and KazMunayGaz agreed for CEFC China Energy to take over 51% stake in KMG International, the former Rompetrol Group, but by July 2018 the deal fell apart due to the difficult financial situation of the Chinese company.
In May 2017, Rompetrol invested $10 millions to develop hybrid gas stations.

Chooseco LLC is an American publishing company based in Waitsfield, Vermont. Founded in 2003 by author R. A. Montgomery and publisher Shannon Gilligan, the company primarily releases reissues of Montgomery's Choose Your Own Adventure series of gamebooks.
History
Montgomery had approached Bantam Books in the 1970s with their idea for "Choose Your Own Adventure" novels based upon a concept created by Edward Packard and originally published by Constance Cappel's and R. A. Montgomery's Vermont Crossroads Press as the "Adventures of You" series, starting with Packard's Sugarcane Island in 1976. The initial books were popular, and the series took off with additional authors, with publication between 1978 and 1998, with over two hundred fifty million books sold in thirty-eight languages. In 2003, Montgomery and their wife Shannon Gilligan opted to form Chooseco to republish some of the classic titles of the series, create new titles, and option the franchise for other media.
Lawsuits
In March 2007, Chooseco filed a lawsuit against car manufacturer DaimlerChrysler, claiming that the company's advertising campaign for their Jeep Patriot model, bearing the tagline "Choose Your Adventure", infringed on Chooseco's trademarks. The suit was ultimately settled.
Chooseco filed a similar trademark lawsuit in January 2019 against movie streaming platform Netflix following the release of Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, an interactive film produced and released by Netflix that uses the "choose your own adventure" phrase. The company has also sent cease and desist notices to developers of indie video games on the itch.io storefront for using the term "choose your own adventure" to describe their game.
Netflix had responded to Chooseco's suit with a number of defenses, including the assertion that the use of the term was artistic expression protected by the First Amendment (see Rogers v. Grimaldi), and a request for Chooseco's trademark "Choose Your Own Adventure" to be cancelled on the basis that it had become genericised. Netflix later conceded on the case and settled with Chooseco on undisclosed terms in November 2020.

Jeremiah John Mahoney (26 July 1880 – 1 August 1966), sometimes spelt Mahony, was an Australian-born cricketer who played four times for New Zealand in the days before New Zealand played Test cricket.
Cricket career
Born in Sydney, Mahoney played as a batsman and occasional wicket-keeper for Wellington from 1902–03 to 1911–12. After top-scoring with 40 not out in a Wellington total of 140 against Lord Hawke's XI in 1902–03, they were selected to play in both the matches New Zealand played against Lord Hawke's XI. In the second match they scored 27 (the second-top score) and 24 (top score) in an innings defeat.
Against Canterbury in 1906–07 Mahoney hit their highest score so far when they made 63 not out, the top score in the match, in the second innings. They were again selected for both of New Zealand's matches later that season, against the touring MCC side. In the first match, batting at number six, they scored 71 not out, adding 82 with the last two batsmen to take New Zealand's total to 207. Their 214 runs at an average of 42.80 made them one of the leading batsmen of the season.
In their two matches in 1907–08 they scored 209 runs at 69.66, again putting them near the top of the national averages, and made their highest score of 84, the top score in the match, in Wellington's victory over Otago.
According to Dan Reese, who played with them in three of their matches for New Zealand, Mahoney was a stubborn batsman and "was a little deaf and took a lot of watching in running singles, or the last run from a hit to the outfield".
Later life
Mahoney worked in Wellington as a tailor's presser. They returned to Australia in 1912 to live in Sydney. Their wife died there in November 1913 after a long illness. They died in Sydney in August 1966, aged 86.

Florence Kahn (Lady Beerbohm) (March 3, 1878, in Memphis, Tennessee – January 13, 1951, in Rapallo, Italy) was an American actor and the first wife of caricaturist and parodist Sir Max Beerbohm.
Acting career
Them father Louis Kahn was a German-Jewish immigrant from Baden who married Pauline Freiberg, a member of a prominent Cincinnati family. They founded the dry goods firm of Kahn & Freiberg in Memphis in 1860 and was also an amateur Shakespeare scholar. Florence's brother Samuel Kahn became an editor of The Commercial Appeal in Memphis. They attended the Clara Conway Institute, a private school in Memphis, and had dancing lessons before going to a finishing school, which they left in June 1894. In 1895 they studied drama at Miss Grace Llewellyn's studio in Memphis. They also attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York.
Florence Kahn appeared in the first American performance of Maeterlink's Intérieur in February 1896. On graduating in April 1897 they joined a touring company as the female lead in The Girl I Left Behind Me. In spring 1898 they played Lady de Winter in The Musketeers with Paul Gilmore in New York, and later on tour.
Kahn appeared in New York in El Gran Galeoto by José Echegaray at the Carnegie Lyceum New York City in 1899, and went on to become a well known Broadway actor noted for their roles in the plays of Ibsen. They played Hilda in the first performance of When We Dead Awaken in America which took place at the Carnegie Lyceum on January 16, 1900. They also appeared in The Master Builder (1900) as Hilda Wangel.
Of their performance in the latter The New York Times wrote:
Kahn also appeared with the actor Richard Mansfield, as Chorus in Shakespeare's Henry V in 1900. They appeared in Don Caesar's Return by Victor Mapes at Wallack's Theatre in New York in 1901. In March 1904 Kahn appeared as Rebecca West in Ibsen's Rosmersholm, but the production was not a success and closed quickly, with Kahn receiving much of the blame:
They "acted" always, not for a moment was they a live woman, least of all an Ibsen hero. They waved across the stage and coiled upon the furniture, and when the crisis of passion ran highest they looked foolish and bleated.
After the failure of Rosmersholm in New York, in 1904 they travelled to Great Britain with a letter of introduction to Max Beerbohm. Beerbohm became infatuated with Kahn and called on them regularly, taking them to meet their family. On their return to America in 1907 Kahn appeared in Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and Rosmersholm in New York City's Lyric Theatre.
In February 1908 Kahn returned to Britain where they appeared as Rebecca West in Ibsen's Rosmersholm, opening at Terry's Theatre. They then toured Britain presenting a series of readings, on one occasion appearing before King Edward VII. It was during this tour that they were courted by Beerbohm and they became engaged in 1908.
Marriage
It has been estimated that during their six-year courtship Beerbohm wrote over 1,000 letters to Kahn. When they were apart they wrote every day, sometimes more than once a day. After their marriage on May 4, 1910, at Paddington Register Office the couple moved to the Villino Chiaro in Rapallo in Italy where they remained for the rest of their lives apart from when they returned to the United Kingdom during World War I and World War II. From the start of the marriage, Beerbohm's friends did not like Kahn, thinking the couple ill-matched. They thought Kahn to be "nervous, shy, timid, retiring, humourless, moralizing, idealizing, prudish, frequently sad and depressed and anti-social", in fact the very opposite of Beerbohm.
In 1931 the Beerbohms returned to Britain so that Kahn could act in Luigi Pirandello's play La Vita che ti Diedi (The Life I Gave You) with a small repertory company in Huddersfield. They returned again in 1935 to play Ase in Peer Gynt at the Old Vic, and in February 1936 they played the Duchess of Gloucester in the Oxford Union Dramatic Society's production of Richard II, directed by John Gielgud. In 1936 Kahn appeared with Gielgud as Mrs Caypor in Alfred Hitchcock's film Secret Agent. At that time not only had they never made a film before but they had never seen one either.
They became Lady Beerbohm when their husband was knighted in 1939.
Florence Kahn died at Rapallo in Italy in 1951 aged 72. They were cremated in Genoa and their ashes scattered from a boat in the Bay of Tigullio. In 1956 their widower Max Beerbohm married their companion and secretary Elisabeth Jungmann on their death bed.

The Georgia Tech Library is an academic library that serves the needs of students, faculty, and staff at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The library consists of the S. Price Gilbert Memorial Library and Dorothy M. Crosland Tower. In addition, the library is connected to and manages the Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons.
The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) recognized the library's effort to reinvent itself by awarding it a 2007 Excellence in Academic Libraries Award. The Georgia Tech Library is located in the center of campus and is open 24/7 as of the Fall term of 2014. Among the Library staff members are subject specialists in 35 disciplines.
Dr. Leslie Sharp serves as Dean of the Georgia Tech Library. They began their tenure as Dean July 1, 2020 after serving as interim chief executive officer for the Library since March 2019, a role they shared with their duties as associate vice provost for Graduate from Education and Faculty Development.
History
Judge Sterling Price Gilbert donated a large sum of Coca-Cola stock to Georgia Tech with the stipulation that the proceeds be used to construct a new library. They later donated more funds to the cause. Ground was broken for the S. Price Gilbert Memorial Library on July 5, 1951, and the building was dedicated on November 21, 1953. The Graduate Addition to the library was opened in 1969, and was renamed Crosland Tower in 1985.
Dorothy M. Crosland was the long-time head librarian; initially appointed as Assistant Librarian in 1925, they were promoted to Librarian in 1927 and Director of Libraries in 1953, a title they would hold until their retirement in 1971.
Paul M. Heffernan, then a professor in the Georgia Tech School of Architecture, was the lead designer on the S. Price Gilbert Library.
In 2017 a large-scale renovation project began with Crosland Tower to modernize it, opening up the space inside and changing the veneer to more curtainwall instead of solid brick to allow more natural light into the building and upgrade the finishes & MEP systems. The Crosland project was finished prior to the start of the Spring 2019 semester. Following its opening, a renovation project began on the S. Price Gilbert Library. The total renovation was completed in Spring 2020, and the Library opened in full for Fall semester 2020.
Collections
The Library's collections include over 2.4 million books, bound periodicals and serials, including about 900,000 government documents, 2.7 million technical reports, over 197,000 cartographic materials, more than 240 online databases, over 29,000 electronic books and 39,000 e-journals.
The Archives and Special Collections department preserves and provides access to the history of Georgia Tech, and includes over 4300 rare books emphasizing the history of science and technology, a 4000-volume science fiction collection, photographic collections, and approximately 1000 manuscript collections.
In 2015, the library moved 99% of its print collections to an off-site service center as part of a partnership with Emory University. This Library Service Center was opened and dedicated in 2016. Plans to move the "core collection" of roughly 30,000 volumes representing the fields of study offered at Georgia Tech back into the building were delayed due to Covid-19.
Services
Upon completion of the renovations in Fall 2020, the Georgia Tech Library brought students a range of new services and spaces. These include:
Collaborative and quiet study spaces throughout the building, including reading rooms on the Grove Level and sixth and seventh floors of Crosland Tower, and first and third floors of Price Gilbert.
The Science Fiction Lounge on the first floor of Crosland Tower featuring circulating items from the Bud Foote Science Fiction Collection.
The Archives Reading Room on the first floor of Crosland Tower.
The Innovation and Ideation Studio on the second floor of Crosland Tower, which includes a Library classroom.
The Media Scholarship Commons on the third floor of Price Gilbert.
The Data Visualization Studio and retroTECH lab on the third floor of Crosland Tower.
The Faculty Research Zone, including a Teaching Studio, on fourth floor of Price Gilbert.
The Graduate Student Community on the sixth floor of Crosland Tower.
Computing clusters in both buildings and Clough.
In addition to the new spaces, the Georgia Tech Library offers a hundred of events, classes, lectures and workshops yearly for students, faculty and the campus community. All are free and serve to supplement the Institute's curriculum.

Louis Foster (born 27 July 2003) is a British racing driver. They currently compete in the Indy Pro 2000 Championship driving for Exclusive Autosport. Foster previously competed in the 2021 Euroformula Open Championship with CryptoTower Racing and the 2020 BRDC British Formula 3 Championship with Double R Racing where they finished third.
Personal life
Louis is the son of former British Touring Car Championship racer Nick Foster. They attended Lord Wandsworth College in Hook, Hampshire. Foster is also a keen hockey and rugby player.
Career
Ginetta Junior Championship
Foster made their car racing debut in the final three meetings of the 2017 Ginetta Junior Championship, driving with Elite Motorsport. They then competed in that year's Ginetta Junior Winter Series, where they won the Rookie Championship.
They returned to the championship in 2018 and was a persistent title contender throughout the season. Foster claimed 19 podiums, of which 9 were victories plus four pole positions and two fastest laps on their way to second place in the championship. They scored the most points of any driver but lost out on the title by just eight points to teammate Adam Smalley after dropped scores were accounted for.
During the campaign, Foster accrued several records; the first rookie to win three races in one weekend, the first driver to win five races in succession and the youngest driver to score an outright victory.
F4 British Championship
Following their successful stint in Ginetta Juniors, Foster moved to single-seaters when they joined Double R Racing for the 2019 F4 British Championship certified by FIA, powered by Ford EcoBoost season. In February 2019, Foster received sponsorship from global used car dealership Copart.
Foster was immediately on the pace, taking victory in only the second race of the season. They followed that with a sublime weekend in Donington, winning two races and scoring a third-place finish in the other to give them a 17-point lead in the championship table.
Across the rest of the season, Foster accrued another three wins and nine podium finishes - dominating at Silverstone – to finish the year third in the championship, remaining in the title hunt until the season finale weekend at Brands Hatch.
BRDC F3 Championship
For 2020, Foster graduated to the BRDC British F3 Championship, remaining with Double R Racing. The opening round at Oulton Park, scheduled for 11 and 13 April, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The season subsequently began at Oulton Park on the 1st and 2 August. In the opening qualifying session of the year, Louis set the benchmark and claimed double pole position in their debut weekend in the series. They followed their qualifying success with a maiden podium finish.
Moving on to Donington Park, Foster claimed their first win the series with a mature drive from the front-row of the grid. They then claimed a string of top-ten finishes, including climbing ten places from 18th to 8th in the second race at Donington.
Further success came at Brands Hatch when Foster scored three top-six finishes, including a third-place podium in the final race. The 17-year-old carried this momentum into the series' second visit to Donington Park, where they claimed another race victory, this time climbing from sixth on the grid, alongside two 11th-place finishes.
Snetterton marked Foster's most successful weekend in the series to date as the Hampshire racer took their second double pole position of the season before converting those into their third win of the year and a further second-place podium alongside fourth and fifth in the additional two races. It also meant Foster took the lead of the Jack Cavill Pole Position Cup.
Euroformula Open
It was announced in October 2020 that Foster would make their debut in Euroformula Open at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. Competing with Double R Racing once again, Foster quickly found themselves on the pace as they gained four places in the opening race to break into the top ten. Qualifying fifth for the second race, Foster launched themselves to third on the first lap and put themselves in prime position to take victory in only their second race in the series.
Shortly after making their debut at Spa-Francorchamps, it was announced that Foster would also contest the rescheduled season finale at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, with the track hosting four races in lieu of the cancelled round at Circuito del Jarama. After qualifying 11th, 10th, 4th and 12th, Foster pulled off a number of daring overtakes in races one and two to climb into the top ten, finishing eighth in both races. Starting from fourth in race three, the 17-year-old leapfrogged two cars on the first lap to take second place and another podium finish in the series, coming within touching distance of the win.
In 2021, Foster switched to CryptoTower Racing to contest the full season. They took pole position at the first round at Portimão and finished in the podium in races 1 and 3, with their brake disc exploding on the formation lap in race 2. Foster secured another two podiums at the second round at Paul Ricard before going on to take a triple win at the third round of the championship at Spa-Francorchamps.
In September, for finishing as Euroformula Open vice champion, Foster was nominated for the Autosport BRDC Award.
Road to Indy
Indy Pro 2000
Earlier in 2021, Foster ran in a private test with Jay Howard Driver Development and later ran in the Chris Griffis Memorial Test with Exclusive Autosport, setting the fastest time of the test. For the 2022 season, Foster signed to drive for Exclusive Autosport for the full season. A dominant season insued, as the Briton won seven races, taking the title at the final round at Portland.
Indy Lights
Following their Indy Pro Championship victory, Foster was announced to be signing for Andretti Autosport for the 2023 Indy Lights season.

Geijera parviflora, commonly known as wilga, is a species of shrub or small tree in the family Rutaceae and is endemic to inland parts of eastern Australia. It has drooping branches, linear to narrow lance-shaped leaves, small white flowers in loose panicles and spherical fruit containing a shiny black seed. Other vernacular names include Australian willow, native willow, sheepbush and dogwood.
Description
Geijera parviflora is a shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of and has drooping branches and leaves often reaching ground level, but these are often grazed by sheep. The leaves are glossy dark green, linear to lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The leaves give off a strong smell when crushed. The flowers are arranged in loose panicles long, each flower on a pedicel about long. The sepals are long, the petals white and long. The smell of the flowers has been described as foetid, but also as citrus-scented and attracts insects. Flowering occurs from June to November and the fruit is more or less spherical, in diameter, each containing a single shiny black seed.
Taxonomy
Geijera parviflora was first formally described in 1848 by English botanist John Lindley in Thomas Mitchell's Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia. The specific epithet parviflora is from the Latin, meaning "small flowers".
Distribution and habitat
Wilga prefers calcareous soils, either red clays or sandy soils, and grows as scattered trees in open woodland or occasionally in stands. It is mainly found in inland New South Wales and Queensland, extending into south-eastern South Australia and is rare in Victoria where it is only known from the north-west of the state, near Kenley.
Uses
Wilga is a useful shade and fodder tree in agricultural areas. Sheep particularly enjoy grazing on the lower branches, although trees appear to vary greatly in palatability (some are eagerly sought after and others ignored). The reason for this variation is unknown, and soil composition is speculated as a cause. Despite being slow growing, it is planted in Australia and overseas as an ornamental. It prefers full sunshine, and can tolerate the occasional light frost and drought. Indigenous Australians chewed the aromatic leaves for alleviating toothache. Regeneration from fresh seed and cuttings has proven to be difficult. It is suggested that the hard seed coat should be cracked, to assist seed germination.

Bleu pétrole (Petrol blue) is the twelfth studio album by the French rocker Alain Bashung, released in March 2008 on Barclay Records. It was the last studio album released during their lifetime.
Production
Great expectations surrounded Bleu pétrole after L'Imprudence, issued in 2002, and the live album La Tournée des grands espaces, issued in 2004. Bashung took time to work on it, before deciding finally to not work with their lyricist Jean Fauque, choosing instead to work with Gaëtan Roussel of Louise Attaque and Gérard Manset. After the more experimental works of the 2000s, Bashung decided to go back to a more traditional rock-sounding album, closer to their works of the 1990s.
The album is dedicated to Mick Larie, a member of Bluegrass Long Distance, who died in July 2007, the mandoline player and friend of Marcel Dadi and Patrick Sébastien. The first single from the album was "Résidents de la République" ("Residents of the Republic").
Bashung began touring to promote the album and sang "Comme un lego" ("Like a lego") by Gérard Manset as the opener of their concerts. On 7 July 2008, an expanded vinyl collector edition of 1,000 copies was issued.
Bleu pétrole was Bashung's last studio album;, who died on 14 March 2009.
Reception
Critical reception
In 2010, the French edition of Rolling Stone magazine named this album the 46th greatest French rock album (out of 100).
The French magazine Les Inrockuptibles called the album an "immense chef-d'œuvre" (a huge masterpiece).

Dr. Henry Clay Moses (18 August 1941 – 16 April 2008) was an American educator. A teacher, college administrator, and school principal, they instituted important changes while the dean of freshmen at Harvard College and helped to lead Trinity School into its third century. A dedicated outdoorsman, they enjoyed running, cycling, backpacking, and mountain climbing.
Early life
Born 18 August 1941 in Washington, D.C. to Henry C. Moses, a vice-president of the Mobil Oil corporation, and Barbara Frost Moses, they attended New Rochelle High School in New Rochelle, New York and then Princeton University (1963) and Cornell University (1968) with a PhD in English. They had two sisters: Margery Phillips and Catherine Barber.
The Manhattanville years
From 1973 to 1977, Moses was dean of students and then vice president for student development at Manhattanville College in Purchase, New York. In addition to their administrative duties, they also taught a creative writing course.
The Harvard years
Moses was the dean of freshmen at Harvard College from 1977 to 1991. There they were responsible for the academic and residential welfare of 1600 freshmen. They served as a member of faculty committees on admissions and financial aid, expository writing, advising and counseling, housing, and undergraduate life, Phillips Brooks House, and the administrative board of Harvard and Radcliffe Colleges. "Hank was a superb Harvard colleague: wise, funny, respectful of tradition but able to think out of the box, courageous, and kind," recalls the current Harvard College Dean of Freshmen Tom Dingman. "His analytical ability was sharp as was their capacity to understand and relate to students and faculty. During their tenure here they built a very strong staff and started programs like the Freshman Outdoor Program that have become critical to our success. Trinity's gain was our loss. Now we all will miss him."
While at Harvard Moses served on special committees and working groups on race relations, alcohol and drug abuse, death and dying, disciplinary reform, intercollegiate athletes, academic policies and procedures, academic assessment, and survey research.
As a lecturer in American literature at Harvard University (1980–1984), Moses taught a survey course in American literature, lectured on Mark Twain and Henry James, and created and taught an upperclassmen course on William Faulkner.
Moses served on both the faculties (lecturing in English) and in the dean's offices of Cornell University, Princeton University, and the University of Virginia. They were the dean of students (1973–1974) and then the vice-president for student development (1975–1977) at Manhattanville College, where they also taught several courses in the English Department.
The Trinity School years
Moses became the twenty-seventh principal of Trinity School in New York City in 1991. They oversaw numerous improvements to Trinity's campus, including the construction of a new building to house the Middle School and two gymnasiums, as well as significant renovations throughout the School. New instructional, athletic, and administrative spaces were constructed and an historical archive was established in preparation for the School's 300th anniversary celebration in 2008–2009. Moses brought the school to a position of financial strength with an endowment that grew from $6 million when they arrived in 1991 to $51 million in 2007. Moses was a leader in building a diverse, inclusive, and committed Trinity community and was responsible for bringing and retaining a superb faculty at the School. Upon the announcement of their retirement—scheduled for June 2009 at the end of the School's tercentennial celebration—the trustees honored their years of service and dedication to bringing together a diverse community of students and teachers by creating the Henry C. Moses Financial Aid Endowment fund.
Moses, known as Hank to their friends and colleagues, brought a love of education and an enthusiasm for childhood and teaching to their work at the School. "He was my best friend in New York," recalls Jake Dresden principal of Concord Academy and former principal of Collegiate School in New York. "A colleague and a counselor, a wise voice of experience, a man of integrity, a man of humor, a family man, a tough and compassionate friend of students and faculty. At a New York Association of Independent Schools conference—during which we mostly played hooky and rode our mountain bikes on the old carriage trails of Mohonk—we shared our histories, our likes and dislikes, and became good friends. While I am heartbroken about their passing, I know they lived a very good life, filled with love from their family and friends and admiration from their colleagues. Trinity School was wise to hire Hank in the same year that I came to Collegiate and to have them for seventeen years, helping to make the school strong and vibrant."
At Freshmen Orientation they asked the ninth grade students to write what they hoped to have accomplished by the time they had graduated from Trinity. At the Senior Retreat they asked the graduating twelfth graders to write about their experiences at the School and to describe their impressions of the place. They treasured these notes from the beginning and end of each student's time in the Upper School and they pored over them to find inspiration to improve the work of the School. They sought to strengthen the students' connection to Trinity Church, Wall Street—where the School was founded in 1709—by establishing events at the church: a matriculation event for the freshmen and a baccalaureate for the graduating seniors. Throughout their tenure at the School they sought to connect to every member of the community and to enhance their lives by reaching out to the larger world.
Frequently asked to consult on education issues, over the years Moses worked with students, faculty, counselors, parents, and trustees at secondary schools and colleges including Phillips Academy Andover, Brown University, Dalton School, Drew University, Harvard Summer Institute on College Admissions, The Nightingale-Bamford School, Oxford Enrichment Program, and U.C. Berkeley.  They are the author of Inside College: New Freedom, New Responsibility (College Board, 1990).
Family
Moses' first marriage was to Jean Smith and with whom they had three children: James Moses, Bruce Moses, and Paige Lewin. That marriage ended in divorce. In 1986, they married Mary Sarah Holland and they had two children: Laurence Henry Moses Holland and William Frederick Moses Holland.

Baranowski Coat of Arms Ostoja
The Baranowski family - a Polish noble family with the Ostoja coat of arms, belonging to the heraldic Clan Ostoja (Moscics). They come from the Jerzykowski family of the Ostoja coat of arms from Jerzyków, located in the former poviat of Gniezno in the Province Poznań. The Baranowski family took their surname from the village of Baranowo, located in the former district of Kościanski of the Poznań Province, the nests of the Baranowski family of the Łodzia coat of arms, to which the Jerzykowski family were related on the distaff side. The Baranowski family were mentioned in the armorial of Bartosz Paprocki.
The oldest source certificates concerning the family
Listed below are selected source certificates concerning the Baranowski family of the Ostoja coat of arms and the nesting villages of Jerzyków and Baranów, until the mid-15th century.
The first mention of the village of Jerzykowo appears in a document from May 28, 1235, in which prince Władysław Odonic granted the village of Vehne, inhabited by the Jerzykowo family, to the Poznań church.
The oldest known records about Baranów come from 1387. It was then that Paweł Naram from Baranów, along with their sons Bogusław and Naram, was in a dispute with Jan from Zbąszyń, the castellan of Łęczyca, about 27 fines for surety. This year, Bogusław from Baranów, son of Naram, sued Bodzęta from Karczew (near Grodzisk).
According to Stanisław Kozierowski, at the end of the 14th century, Jerzykowo together with the village of Kowalskie were the seat of the Czewoy family.
The first Jerzykowski belonging to the Ostoyy family was Mikołaj of Jerzyków, the castellan of Ostrów, who appeared in the sources in the years 1378-1390, who in 1380 gave the village of Gortatowo near Swarzędz to the chapter of the Poznań cathedral in exchange for the village of Jurzykowo with a mill. From the newly acquired goods, Mikołaj began to write with Jerzyków.
In Jerzykowo, in 1389, Naram Ostrowski from Jerzykowo performed. Perhaps Naram was a close relative of Mikołaj of Jerzyków, the castellan of Ostrów (hence the name Narama Ostrowski)? The same Naram (actually Paweł Naram) appeared in the years 1387-1390 as the owner of the property in Baranów.
Mikołaj of Jerzyków, the castellan of Ostrów, in 1390 led a dispute over 15 fines with Paweł Naram from Baranów.
In 1422, Adam, the heir of the Kowalski and Jerzyków, appears in the Poznań township and land registers.
In 1435, Bogusław of Baranów, son of Naram, left their wife Dorota 50 pennies in the dowry and the same dowry for half of the property in Baranów. The same Bogusław in 1445 was in dispute with Jarosław from Doków Suchy.
In 1449 brothers Piotr and Aleksander of Jerzyków appear in the town and land registers of Gniezno.

Native Tongue Title is a revivalistic term that refers to compensation for linguicide (language killing). Native Tongue Title is the enactment of a statute-based, ex gratia financial compensation scheme, to cover efforts to resuscitate a heritage tongue that was killed (for example, due to colonisation), or to empower an endangered one.
Origin
The term was coined by linguist and language revivalist Ghil'ad Zuckermann. They modelled it on the Australian term native title, which refers to the common law doctrine according to which the land rights of Indigenous peoples persist after the assumption of sovereignty under settler colonialism.
Native tongue title vs native title
Zuckermann argues that despite native title, and although some Australian states have enacted ex gratia compensation schemes for the victims of the Stolen Generations policies, the victims of linguicide are overlooked. They propose that existing competitive grant schemes by the Australian Government to support Australian Aboriginal languages should be complemented with compensation schemes, which are based on a claim of right rather than on competition.
Anthropologist Timothy Haines wrote that Zuckermann's "remarkable achievement" of reclaiming the Barngarla language in South Australia may have "assisted in the process of the recognition of the Barngarla people's native title". The presiding Federal Court judge, Justice John Mansfield, had commented that their active pursuit of language revival, assisted by Zuckermann, showed evidence of the people's continued connection with their land and culture "despite the separation that many had endured as 'Stolen Generation' children of the 1960s and 70s, when they were forcibly removed by the State to homes in Adelaide, far distant from their native Eyre Peninsula in South Australia's west".

Louis Marius Schoon (22 June 1937 – 7 February 1999) was a white anti-apartheid activist of Afrikaner descent.
Education
South African political activist and teacher Marius Schoon matriculated at Jeppe High School for Boys in Johannesburg in 1954, then at the Afrikaans University of Stellenbosch, before moving to the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg for their postgraduate studies. While there they became a member of the South African Congress of Democrats (SACOD) in association with the African National Congress (ANC).
Political activity
In the early 1960s, Marius Schoon plotted to bomb the Hospital Hill Police Station in Johannesburg. Their group included Mike Ngubeni and Raymond Thoms. An undercover police agent provocateur infiltrated Schoon's group and supplied them with a fake bomb with a view to entrapment. Schoon was arrested and sentenced to 12 years in Pretoria Local Prison. Schoon's first wife Diana committed suicide while Schoon was in prison. As an Afrikaner himself, Schoon was more hated than other anti-apartheid activists by the Afrikaner National Party government which had instituted the apartheid system. Authorities prevented them from attending Diana's funeral and from visiting their daughter Jane. Authorities released Schoon from prison in 1976 having served their full term without remission, with requirements to restrict their movements. Authorities declared Schoon a "banned" person, which meant they were prohibited from leaving home between 6 PM and 6 AM, and forbade them to teach or associate with other political activists.
Bombed
In June 1977, Schoon married Jeanette Curtis, a banned student and trade union activist, the sister of Neville Curtis. The couple feared for their safety in South Africa and moved to Botswana, first to the capital Gaborone, then to Molepolole, teaching at Kgari Sechele Secondary School, and later back to Gaborone where they jointly ran the Botswana branch of the [International Voluntary Service], all the while continuing to work for the anti-apartheid movement. They had two children: Katryn (1978) and Fritz (1981). During this time, internally within the African National Congress, the Schoons broke Craig Williamson's cover. They were an apartheid government spy named later publicly confirmed as a highly successful infiltrator of the liberation movements. This allowed the ANC leadership to attempt to manipulate Williamson covertly for the movement's ends for a time. Later, following a warning from the United Kingdom's High Commissioner (ambassador) in Botswana that Marius was a target for assassination by the apartheid government security forces, the Schoon family moved to Angola via Lusaka, Zambia.
Both Marius and Jeanette Schoon worked as university lecturers with the ANC in Lubango, Angola. On 28 June 1984, while Schoon was away, Jeanette Schoon collected—either from their personal postbox or from the University mail office—and carried home a parcel bomb, which exploded on opening. It has not been established whether the bomb was addressed to Marius Schoon individually or to both the Schoons as a couple. The explosion killed them and their daughter Katryn. Their son Fritz, a toddler at the time, survived and was found wandering around the house. They never fully recovered from the trauma of seeing their mother and sister murdered before their eyes and developed epilepsy as a direct consequence. After the bombing, Schoon and son moved several times, first to Tanzania, then Zambia and eventually to Ireland.
In 1986, Schoon married Sherry Mclean. Schoon returned to South Africa in 1990 after the ban on anti-apartheid parties was lifted. They died on 7 February 1999 from lung cancer, aged 61.
Truth and Reconciliation Commission
At the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Amnesty hearings, Craig Williamson admitted that as a security officer working for the apartheid government, they had sent the parcel bomb to Schoon's house in Angola and killed Schoon's wife and daughter.
At the TRC, Williamson's bomb-maker, Jerry Raven, testified:
"I did not know who the letters were intended for. It was only after the death of Jeanette Schoon and their child and the congratulations from Mr Williamson, that I realised that they had been the targets for one of the devices I had manufactured. On questioning Williamson about the Schoon incident they said that the letter had been intended for Marius Schoon but it served the[m] right. They alleged that the Schoons had always used their daughter as their bomb disposal expert. On requesting clarification they said that whenever they received suspicious parcels they would throw them in the back yard and let the child play with them until such time they deemed it fit to open them."
Schoon filed a civil suit against Williamson, seeking damages for their son Fritz. However, the suit was suspended pending Williamson's Amnesty hearing. Schoon testified at Williamson's hearing and is remembered for their strong stance against amnesty for the killer. They favoured justice over the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's call for forgiveness, reconciliation and an amnesty. Williamson was granted amnesty in June 2000, a year after Schoon's death, a decision their son appealed.

The second season of the television series HaShminiya was originally broadcast on Arutz HaYeladim (HOT) in Israel.
Season overview
The second season opens in an illustrious law office of Dedi and Avner, in guilt that they used the kids in illegal ways. They are going to lose it, but the testimony of Yair Noam, the prime minister (that was the head of the project as the education minister) prevents it. In the continuation, Dedi, Dganit and Avner starts a new project, with the country's confirmation this time. They are getting an elaborate watch-tower in the top of the Azrieli towers; there they can work easily. The ostensible reason is solving some of the country issues, but in fact, the country is trying to use their lambda. The project is well funded by the Prime Minister and their assistant, Muli Noam.
Nini decides to be 15 again, and Aya is visiting Lillie in jail and even to Patmos, their asylum. The plane Aya boarded to Patmos crashed on the sea. It was assumed Aya died in the crash, although no corpse was found. At the same time, Dganit meets an orphaned girl named Nitzan and adopts them to their house. Nitzan sleeps in Aya's room and starts to spend time with the group. At first, she's dating Dori, but finally she's dating Adam, after they reconcile themselves with Aya's death. Avner recognizes lambda ripples in Nitzan too and they join the project, instead of Aya. At the same time, it is seen that Aya is not dead, but in an isolated desert in the middle of nowhere.
Aya confronts the snatcher who is Muli Noam, disguising themselves with a purple Pikachu mask. Muli is a member of a sect named "Scorpio", a destructive sect that wants to spread their ideas using the lambda ripples and wants to dominate the world. The sect is trying to pump Aya's energy and even threatens to hurt Adam's sister, Rotem. Later, they kidnap Dedi. At the same time, Daniel Harris, a 19-year-old millionaire, is getting into Natascha and Roni's life. He's dating Roni and taking Natascha as a beginner artist under their patronage. But, they are a member of the Scorpio sect too. And as they are, Lina, Natascha's cousin, does too. Nearly at the end of the season, it is revealed that Lillie was a member of the sect also; they saved their ex-husband and daughter, Dedi and Aya, but they are going to jail, again.
The sect members kidnap the octette and bring them into the temple where Aya, Dedi and Lillie are. Finally, Dedi shoots Muli and all the sect members are halted by the police, except Daniel, who escapes. The octette members, and especially Adam, are shocked to see Aya alive. Aya is coming back home, but they are broken-hearted and feels hard and uncomfortable with their friends. Nitzan is moving to Roni's place, instead of Roni's sister, Elli, who is flying to London as a MTV emissary. Dganit tells Dedi that they are pregnant, and they are getting married.

Russia–Rwanda relations () refers to the bilateral relationship between the two countries, Russia and Rwanda. Russia has an embassy in Kigali.
History
Soviet-era relations
On 30 June 1962, a day before Rwanda gained independence from Belgium, the Soviet Union sent a telegram to Kigali recognising Rwanda as a sovereign and independent state, and offered to establish diplomatic relations. Diplomatic relations were established between the two states on 17 October 1963.
Modern ties
Rwanda recognised the Russian Federation in January 1992 as the successor state of the Soviet Union, after the latter's dissolution. Due to financial difficulties, the Rwandan embassy in Moscow closed at the end of 1995, and all the activities of the Embassy were shifted to the Rwandan Embassy in Berlin-Germany until recently in March 2013 when Rwandan cabinet appointed its new Ambassador to Russia to be based in Moscow.
Overview of present relations
The current Ambassador of Rwanda to Russia is Lieutenant General Frank Mushyo Kamanzi, while the current Ambassador of Russia to Rwanda is Karen Chalyan, who was appointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in March 2018.
Official visits
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Rwandan President Paul Kagame met on the sidelines of the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony in June 2018. Kagame visited again on their birthday in 2019 during the 1st Russia-Africa Summit.
Humanitarian ties
In 2003, Charles Murigande the then Rwanda Foreign Minister called on Russia for assistance with public health services. They noted that there was 1 doctor for every 50,000 Rwandans, and in 1989 the Soviet Union promised assistance in this field, but it was not forthcoming due to problems with payment.

Solna Municipality ( or , ) is a municipality in Stockholm County in Sweden, located just north of Stockholm City Centre. Its seat is located in the town of Solna, which is a part of the Stockholm urban area. Solna is one of the richest municipalities in Sweden.
The municipality is a part of Metropolitan Stockholm. None of the area is considered rural, which is unusual for Swedish municipalities, which normally are of mixed rural/urban character. Solna is the third smallest municipality in Sweden in terms of area.
Solna borders Stockholm Municipality to the south, southeast and northwest; to Sundbyberg Municipality to the west; to Sollentuna Municipality to the north; and to Danderyd Municipality to the northeast. The boundary with Danderyd Municipality is delineated by the Stocksundet strait.
There are two parishes in Solna Municipality: Råsunda (population 29,677) and Solna (population 28,317). Solna Parish once included parts of present-day City of Stockholm.
Solna is divided into eight traditional parts with no administrative functions: Bergshamra, Haga, Hagalund, Huvudsta, Järva, Råsunda, Skytteholm and Ulriksdal. The largest districts are Råsunda, Hagalund and Huvudsta, with the Solna Centrum in between them.
With few exceptions, Solna's built-up areas have a suburban character, but there are also several large parks and Friends Arena, Sweden's new national football stadium adjacent to the Solna station of Stockholm commuter rail.
The final matches of both the 1958 FIFA (men's) World Cup and the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup were played at Råsunda Stadium, the national football stadium from 1937 to 2012 (demolished in 2013).
Solna has attracted a wide range of businesses and authorities, making it a major place of work in Greater Stockholm. Among the most important employers are the medical university Karolinska Institutet and the Karolinska University Hospital. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) are also located in Solna.

While living in Glastonbury, Milner became a member of Future Farmers of America, worked as a camp counselor, and attended high school at Glastonbury High School, which they dropped out of during their junior year.
In the early 1950s, they received a high school equivalency diploma while serving in the United States Air Force.

Early years (1908–1930)
Louis Auguste Jules Frans De Jaegher was born in Nieuwpoort, Belgium, on 30 July 1908. Their parents were François Joseph Jules Marie de Jaegher and Juliette Louise Marie Paul. They married Cécile Dutrieu. They studied the humanities at the Royal Atheneum in Antwerp. In October 1926 they were admitted to the Colonial University of Belgium, graduating in July 1930.
Territorial administrator (1930–1946)
On 1 September 1930 De Jaegher was appointed territorial administrator 2nd class. They reached Boma on 26 September 1930. They were assigned for their internship to Baseka Bongwalanga Territory in Lulonga District, Équateur Province. In August 1931 they were appointed head of the Ekota Bosaka Territory in Équateur District. In June 1932 they transferred to the Bakutu Bosaka Territory in Tshuapa District. They left Boma on leave on 6 October 1933, and returned on 23 March 1934. Their second term was spent in the territories of Ekota Bakutu and Boende in Tshuapa District.
De Jaegher left on leave from 23 April to 8 October 1937, then returned to Boende Territory in Tshuapa District. In addition to their functions as territorial administrator they were deputy judge of the district court and auxiliary judge at the Court of First Instance in Coquilhatville. During World War II (1939–1945) Belgium was invaded on 10 May 1940.
Between then and 20 April 1947 De Jaegher took only three short leaves totalling nine months, two in South Africa and one in Kivu. On 1 July 1942 De Jaegher was promoted to senior territorial administrator. They were assigned to the Congo-Ubangi District on 12 June 1944. They were made administrator of Bumba Territory.

On 12 April 1946 De Jaegher turned to Tshuapa as intern for the grade of district commissioner, and on 20 March 1947 their internship ended and they became district commissioner of Tshuapa. On 20 April 1947 they flew to Belgium for leave. They married on 12 July 1947, and left for the Congo with their wife on 17 January 1948.

The governor, Antoine Lamborelle, retired and De Jaegher was appointed governor of the Province of Kasai on 1 July 1958. On 20 June 1959 the journal KASAI published a letter from chief Kalamba Mangole Sylvestre and Barthélemy Mukenge, president of the Lulua–Frères association. It called on the Belgian government to unite the Lulua in a single kingdom under one chief, and to recognise the property rights of land belonging to the Lulua. It also stated that the Baluba should recognize Lulua rights and submit to Lulua customary authority, or else return to their original lands.
At De Jaegher's request the assistant district commissioner M.A. Dequenne, the first burgomaster M. Hentgen and the Provincial Director of Indigenous Affairs met on 29 June to discuss the Lulua-Baluba conflict and the Lulua claims. A 9-page draft confidential report was completed on 8 July. It was stolen that evening, communicated to activists of the Muluba Solidarity Movement, then put back where it had been found. The report caused outrage among the Baluba. On 9 July a three page letter from Evariste Kalonji and Justin Kasanda violently protesting "the scandalous attitude of the Belgian Colonial Administration" was sent to the presidents of the Belgian Chamber and Senate, with copies to King Baudouin, the Minister of Congo, the Governor General in Kalina and the Governor of the Province of Kasai. On 7 August De Jaegher received a delegation of leaders from Léopoldville, consisting of Patrice Lumumba (Mouvement National Congolais), Bertin-Onésime Tumba (Interfédérale) and Barthélemy Mujanayi (Mouvement solidaire Muluba).

Francesco Uguccione (or François Hugotion de Aguzzoni) (died 14 July 1412) was the Archbishop of Bordeaux from 1384 until their death. They were a lawyer from Urbino and a staunch supporter of the King of England in the Hundred Years' War.
In their early years Uguccione was a legate at Barcelona before they were appointed to the vacant see of Bordeaux.
In 1400, Uguccione, along with the Bishop of Bath and Wells, as well as Hugh le Despenser, were appointed proctors for Gascony.
By 1406, the French had gained a strong upper hand in the region. Uguccione was by then a cardinal. In spring and summer of that year they began a long string of desperate letters to the English king, Henry Bolingbroke.
They implored Their Majesty for aid and assured them of the gravity of the situation, including the death of the lord of Mussidan, a Gascon loyal to the English, who had been commanding the fortress at Blaye and had left only a daughter. On 30 June, they wrote: "I have written to you so many times and so lengthily concerning the state of your land, and I have cried so much that my voice has become hoarse."
As an influential diplomat and cardinal, Uguccione travelled extensively in the early 15th century. In Autumn 1408 they went to England, where they sought to persuade the English as per the summons of the College of Cardinals to send a delegation to the Council of Pisa then struggling to put an end to the Western Schism. They convinced the English, but the council did nothing but exacerbate the schism.
From England, Uguccione, accompanied by their secretary Pey Berland went to Italy and in 1410 the archbishop rewarded Berland with one of the canonries of Bordeaux Cathedral. In 1412 the two were in Florence when Uguccione died. Berland supervised their burial and then went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land before returning once more to Bordeaux.
In 1413, Berland was rewarded post mortem by their old master when Pope John XXIII, fulfilling a request by Uguccione that "his beloved servant" Berland not be forgotten, granted the canon a prebend. Uguccione was succeeded as archbishop by David de Montferrand.

Phyllostegia glabra is a species of flowering plant in the mint family known by the common name smooth phyllostegia. It is endemic to Hawaii.
Known varieties include Phyllostegia glabra var. glabra and P. g. var. lanaiensis, the latter being a perennial herb with dentate leaves, often reddish or red-veined, and white flowers, occasionally tinged with purple, distinguished from P. g. var. glabra by its shorter calyx and narrower leaves.
NatureServe lists P. g. var. glabra as vulnerable and P. g. var. lanaiensis as possibly extinct.
In September 1991, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) listed Phyllostegia glabra var. lanaiensis as an endangered species, stating that it had not been seen since a single plant was sighted on Lanai in the 1980s. The variety may still exist on the island, perhaps in rugged habitat that has not been surveyed recently.
In September 2021, FWS stated that the last confirmed sighting of P. g. var. lanaiensis occurred in 1914 and proposed that the variety be declared extinct and stricken off the endangered species list.

Direct Line is an insurance company based in Bromley, England. Founded in 1985, as the country's first direct car insurance company, it has since expanded to offer a range of general insurance products. Its policies are underwritten by the regulated subsidiary UK Insurance Limited, and it is owned by the Direct Line Group.
Company history
Founded in Croydon by Martin Long and Peter Wood with £20 million from the Royal Bank of Scotland, Direct Line sold its first motor insurance policy in 1985. It was the first insurance company in the United Kingdom to underwrite using computers and sell insurance directly by telephone, thus removing the need for a broker and reducing costs.
The company was also the first insurer in the United Kingdom to open its office in the evenings and weekends, and the first to offer a twenty four hour helpline. In 1988, it started to sell home insurance. Direct Line is renowned for having transformed financial services in the United Kingdom.
The company grew by advertising in the national press, television and marketing to RBS customers. It launched a long standing mascot of a red telephone on wheels in 1989, which rapidly established high levels of recall among consumers.
The mascot had altered slightly over the years; being accompanied by a red mouse on wheels to represent the company's website in 2005, which was dropped in 2020, with another re brand leaving the phone on its own once more. In September 2014, the brand worked with Saatchi and Saatchi to relaunch its advertising, which saw Hollywood actor Harvey Keitel reprise their role as the character Winston Wolfe from the 1994 film Pulp Fiction. The company had one million customers after eight years by June 2003.
The company expanded with a series of new offshoots in the 1990s. In 1995, a Spanish offshoot, Linea Directa, started offering motor insurance in Spain. They expanded into travel insurance in 1996, pet insurance in 1997, and Direct Line Breakdown started offering breakdown insurance in 1998. Other global offshoots included Germany, Italy, and Japan.
Their non general insurance products umbrella Direct Line Financial services launched their first non insurance product, Direct Line Personal Loan, in 1993, the following year, they started to offer mortgages, in 1995, Direct Line Life started offering life insurance, in 1996, they launched savings accounts and a PEP unit trust, and in 1998, the company started to offer pensions. The company's first website, directline.co.uk, was launched in 1997, which was later renamed directline.com in 1999.
The innovations extended into the 2000s with the launch of the first online claims registration and tracking facility in the United Kingdom for its motor insurance customers in 2001, and Home Response 24 Emergency Insurance, launching in 2003. Direct Line was bought by RBS Insurance, a subsidiary of RBS Group, in June 2003. Royal Bank of Scotland was forced to sell Direct Line as a result of European regulations that prevent companies from receiving state aid.
Direct Line floated on the London Stock Market in October 2012. The Direct Line Group owns a number of brands including Churchill Insurance, Privilege and Green Flag. The company made a number of tough financial decisions at the beginning of the 2010s, including abandoning some lines of business, making redundancies, and closing 14 of their 27 offices in the United Kingdom.
Services
Today, Direct Line offers a range of general insurance products including car, van, home, landlord, pet, and travel insurance as well as breakdown cover. They also offer life insurance.
The company started a new subsidiary in September 2007, Direct Line for Business, which provides a range of business insurance products to landlords and the small business sector.
Controversy
In January 2012, Direct Line, along with sister company Churchill Insurance, was fined £2.17m by the FSA, after being found guilty of altering complaints files.
Awards
Direct Line has won a number of awards including:
Financial Services Forum Awards 2016: Advertising; Customer Experience; Customer Loyalty and Retention, Judges' Special Award for Marketing Excellence.
YourMoney.com Awards 2016: Direct Winners – Best Direct Car Insurance Provider
Your Money Awards 2015: Direct Winners – Best Direct Car Insurance Provider
Rebranding
In Italy and Germany, Direct Line was acquired by MAPFRE Group in September 2014, and re branded to Verti in January 2017. Verti is a brand owned by MAPFRE Group, operating in Italy, Germany, Spain and the United States.

The Brazilian tanager (Ramphocelus bresilius) is a species of bird in the family Thraupidae.
It is endemic to eastern Brazil and far northeastern Argentina, occurring in the coastal region from Paraíba and southwards to Santa Catarina and Misiones.
The Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus described the Brazilian tanager in 1766 in the twelfth edition of their Systema Naturae. They coined the binomial name Tanagra bresilia. It is now placed in the genus Ramphocelus which was introduced by the French zoologist Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest in 1805.
The Brazilian tanager is a typical member of the family, with a heavy bill and sexually dimorphic plumage. It is long and weighs . The plumage of the male is bright red with black wings and a black tail. The bill is black above and pale below. The female is mostly grey-brown with a brown-red belly and breast.
A frugivorous bird, it is easily found in its natural biome wherever there is food enough available, tending to behave aggressively towards other species of birds when disputing for food. Its habitats include shrubby areas that are not forested, including coastal scrub, forest clearing and edge, swamps, gardens, and city parks. The species has declined in some areas due to trapping for the caged bird trade, but it is tolerant of disturbed habitats and is not considered to be threatened with extinction.
The Brazilian tanager is omnivorous, taking pulpy fruits, seeds and insects. It nests by building a cup-shaped nest hidden amongst foliage, where it lays two to three greenish-blue, black-spotted eggs.

Paraga in football is a popular expression in Greece that refers to the control of EPO by extra-institutional bodies, in the manipulation of matches by football players, selected Referee (football) and generally throughout the illegal activity around organizing the tournaments.
The wagon factor
It is Antonis Mantzavelakis, an agent of the PAO, who has established the bribery of players and agents of rival teams since the establishment of the First National and with a suitcase
The case of flowers
On May 28, 1975, the semi-final semi-final cup was held in Thessaloniki between Heracles and Panathinaikos
Giorgos Rokidis, a former player of Panathinaikos, complains that Panathinaikos, the well-known and non-outstanding general captain, Antonis Mantzavelakis, "approached" themselves and their teammates to Heracles Zacharias Chaliambalias and Takis Nikoloudis.
The three players were punished by Hercules and were not used in the match. Hercules precedes 1-0 and loses 2-1 from Panathinaikos. Home goalkeepers Grigoris Fanaras ate a completely funny goal. Who Fanaras after the "flower affair", as bribery went through history, opened a florist in Thessaloniki!
The accused Panathinaikos cleaned up with the vote of former Olympic captain, Patriarch of Olympiacos, George Andrianopoulos, Mayor of Piraeus, Minister of Commercial Shipping and, of course, President of Olympiacos.
"I was not going to vote against Panathinaikos", they were confessed, not publicly, by lawyer George Andrianopoulos who ultimately assumed responsibility for the release of the eternal adversary.
Chalkidis case
Wednesday, February 3, 1982. Heracles of Thessaloniki hosts the KAUF, in the first match of the two teams, during the 16th phase of the 1981-82 season. Before the game begins, Heracles denounces an attempt to bribe the player of Orphanides by the president of ... Kastoria Halkidis, so Orphanides has a reduced performance at the Hercules-PAO game.
There are cassettes for the disputed talks, which were also heard by journalists from Thessaloniki, at a press conference organized by the president of Heracles FC, Mr. Tertilinis. In these cassettes, Halkides of Kastoria is told to Orphanides of Hercules:
Halkidis: "Vardinoyannis is a State. They do not understand anything. If you have a good deal with them, you have solved the problem of your life. I will get from them a loan of 230,000,000 drachmas. That's why I act. Let them take a goal and get 2,000,000 drachmas. Take these 200,000 drachmas (and they handed them 2 bundles of 100,000 drachmas sealed by the National Bank of Kastoria) and in the evening after the match if everything goes well we will meet in Chalcedon for the rest .
Orphanides: For the Second Game? Halkidis: "There we do not need. We have the arbitration. And do not forget that Vardinoyannis is a State. Here we did the Indian (Bublis) Greek.
Paraga of Thomas
The term is mostly associated with the championships of Olympiacos F.C. during the years 1997-2003 and its then president Sokratis Kokkalis, but has also spread to refer to the general corruption in the Greek football. According to the public opinion, the lure has always been the annual financial bonus from UEFA for the participating teams in the UEFA Champions League.
With the method of telephone tapping, Makis Triantafyllopoulos, a TV journalist, trapped a conversation between Thomas Mitropoulos (invisible owner of Egaleo F.C. and at the same time "advisor of Olympiakos on arbitration matters") and a referee (Spathas), saying "...only Olympiacos, only Olympiacos should win, nothing else, and Egaleo. Everybody else should go and fuck off..." and referring to Kokkalis as the Uncle. The journalist involved also the president then of the Hellenic Football Federation, Vassilis Gagatsis.
"Koriopolis"
After the taking of Olympiakos' leadership by Evangelos Marinakis, new scandals came in the light, such as the Koriopolis scandal. In one of the recorded conversations, Olympiacos Volou' chairperson Achilleas Beos asks protection for the referees (Kalopoulos, Tryfonas) from Evangelos Marinakis, after a controversial winning game of Olympiakos against Panathinaikos on 21 February 2011. In February 2012, the Superleague Greece with the agreement of the Hellenic Football Federation achieved the replacement of the two football prosecutors (Fakos, Antonakakis) with two others (Petropoulos, Karras). The investigation had no progress.
Reactions and judicial process
In 1999, after a derby match between Olympiacos F.C. and A.E.K. Athens F.C., Demis Nikolaidis and other AEK players decided to abstain from the Greece national football team as a protest for the arbitration. They revoked in 2001 after the coming of Otto Rehhagel as manager.
In 2004, the ex-manager of Egaleo FC, Stéphane Demol, stated that the reason they were sacked from the team was because they didn't agree with the president on match-fixing.
In 2008, referee Dimitris Pontikis stated that indeed there was among the referees a group that favoured Olympiacos F.C., in exchange for a better career.
On 21 February 2011, after a controversial derby match between Olympiakos and Panathinaikos F.C. (referee Kalopoulos), Panathinaikos striker Djibril Cissé had an wrangle with Evangelos Marinakis and stated they would abandon Superleague Greece because of the arbitration.
With the break out of the Koriopolis scandal, appeals to the Greek Justice were made by some politicians, such as the ministers Yiannis Kourakis and Giorgos Floridis, who stated that "a gang controls the referees from the background". In 2011, minister Pavlos Geroulanos called the Greek football "totally corrupted". The whole judicial process had no result. At the time, UEFA officials said no action was presently being considered against Olympiakos regarding its participation in the Champions League of the following season.
"Criminal Organization"
In August 2014, new elements came in the light by the National Intelligence Service involving Marinakis, Giorgos Sarris (president of the Hellenic Football Federation) and other football officers, referees and judges in the establishment of a "criminal organisation". Also, Marinakis is appearing to be behind the attack to the bakery shop of Konstantineas and behind attacks to referees (Giorgos Daloukas, Dimitris Kyrkos etc.), journalists and others.
In September 2014, Olivier Kapo, ex-player of Levadiakos F.C., stated in French media that "in Greek football everything is corrupted, mafia-controlled, while FIFA and UEFA simply don't care".
In November 2014, the Chief Refereeing Officer Hugh Dallas criticized the arbitration of Ilias Spathas, after a match of Olympiacos, as the "worst they have ever seen" saying that the mistakes were not normal. A few days later they quit from being responsible for the appointments of refereeing officials for Super League and Football League matches.
In June 2015, ex-owner of Fostiras F.C., Carlo Vandekerkhof, stated: "the situation in Greece is a shame, the second division is a catastrophy...I was approached also to fix a match...seems to be in their culture".
Paramount of sanitation
With the inauguration of the government by SYRIZA and in cooperation with Stavros Kontonis, the presidents of PAOK and AEK recruited a number of dark personalities of football. Achilles Beos, for example, was identified in Macedonia's Palace owned by Ivan Savvidi when some 35 representatives of the Union were gathered in the presence of both the owner of PAOK and the owner of AEK Dimitris Melissanidis. I saw some friends, I came for another job, Beos justifies. A few months later they traveled to Rostov, Russia, where Savvides' operations are based, as a representative of the Volos Municipality with which the Russian city is framed and last May hosted PAOK and AEK in Volos in a truly unforgettable Cup final.
Today, Mr. Mitropoulos appears next to Dimitris Melissanidis, for whom they allegedly have activated their contacts according to press reports in order to change the administration of EPO. As in Beau's case, neither the reappearance of Thomas in the forefront seems to bother.
The "redevelopment", which has been the major success of the instruments belonging to the wider Savvides business group, not only does not touch Thomas, but not even the president of the ET of that time, Vassilis Gagatsis, who even draws a series of criminals on their back, was found to run the Super League co-op, having been promoted naturally by PAOK.
Suddenly, Greek football was dismantled from yesterday's "bad guys" to end up in the hands of "bad" of yesterday, whose sins were purged in the backyard of the guided media army.
In a nutshell, the redevelopment of Ivan Savvidis ours '' Vangelis Grammenos, is that of the throne of Thomas Mitropoulos, Achilles Beos and Vasilis Gagatsis.

Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Edward Flynn Fawcus DSO MC TD (19 October 1886 – 10 August 1936), was awarded the Military Cross for leading a night attack at Cape Helles in August 1915 at the beginning of the Gallipoli Campaign, awarded the Croix de Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur for their bombing work in the Gallipoli Campaign, awarded the DSO for their Command of a Battalion of the 1/5th North Staffordshire Regiment toward the end of World War I and was afterwards Commander of the 1/5th Sherwood Foresters.
Life
Fawcus was born on 19 October 1886 in Keswick, the second son of W.P.J. Fawcus. They were educated at Bedford Modern School.
Fawcus was on active service with the Marakwet Patrol in British East Africa in 1911 and mentioned in despatches. At the outbreak of World War I they were on active service the next day with the King's African Rifles in German East Africa where they served until February 1915 before being sent to Egypt with the 7th Manchester Regiment.
In May 1915, Fawcus was in Gallipoli with the 7th Manchesters and the 1/6th Lancashire Fusiliers where they were awarded the Military Cross for leading a night attack at Cape Helles in August 1915. They were made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour for their bombing work during the Gallipoli Campaign.
From January to July 1916, Fawcus was in Egypt with the 7th, 8th and 9th Manchesters and then served in France until 1918. As Commander of a battalion of the 1/5th North Staffordshire Regiment they were awarded the Distinguished Service Order in June 1918 and they later commanded the 1/5th Sherwood Foresters for eighteen months. During World War I they were mentioned in despatches three times.
Fawcus was killed in an aeroplane crash at Pagham in the United Kingdom on 10 August 1936. The pilot, Michael Richard Montagu, was apparently attempting a third loop the loop over the sea when the engine choked and the plane plunged into shallow water killing Fawcus and Montagu. Montagu was a stepson of Lord Kimberley.
Fawcus married Alexandra James in 1918, the daughter of Mr & Mrs William James of West Dean House, Chichester, Sussex who were friends of King Edward and Queen Alexandra. There is a photograph of their wife at the National Portrait Gallery. They were survived by their wife, two sons and a daughter. They were well known in East Africa where he'd lived in Kenya and Tanganyika. One of their sons, James Fawcus, was killed in March 1945 whilst serving with the King's Royal Rifle Corps.

The spotted bamboowren (Psilorhamphus guttatus) is a species of bird in the family Rhinocryptidae, the tapaculos. It is found in southeastern Brazil, far northeastern Argentina, and possibly Paraguay.
Taxonomy and systematics
The spotted bamboowren is the only member of its genus and has no subspecies. It has at various times been placed in families Formicariidae (the antthrushes), Sylviidae ("typical" warblers), Thamnophilidae (antbirds), Troglodytidae (wrens), and Polioptilidae (gnatcatchers). Studies of its morphology and later of its genetics have firmly placed it in the tapaculo family.
Description
The spotted bamboowren is long. Males weigh , and one specimen thought to be a female weighed . The adult male's head and upper back are gray, and the lower back brownish. The throat and upper breast are whitish to buff, merging to buff on the lower breast and belly. The back, wings, and belly are sprinkled with small white, brown, or black spots. The adult female is similar, but the top of the head and upper back are brown, and the upper breast buffy.
Distribution and habitat
The spotted bamboowren is endemic to the Atlantic Forest biome of Brazil and Argentina. Its range extends from southeastern Minas Gerais and western Espírito Santo through Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil into Argentina's northern Misiones Province. It might also occur in southeastern Paraguay, though the South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society (AOS) has not confirmed that.
As its name implies, the spotted bamboowren is usually found in bamboo, typically at the edge of dense forest, but also in tangles of vines and other dense foliage. In the northern part of its range it is found from elevation and in the south from up.
Behavior
Feeding
The spotted bamboowren typically feeds around above ground in bamboo and branches but up to in vine tangles. It occasionally forages on the ground. Its principle prey is insects and insect larvae.
Breeding
The spotted bamboowren's breeding phenology has not been studied.
Vocalization
The spotted bamboowren's song is described as "wood-wood-wood" repeated for up to 20 seconds with changing pitch and volume .
Status
The IUCN has assessed the spotted bamboowren as least concern. Its range is restricted to the southern Atlantic Forest, a biome that has undergone extensive clearing for agriculture and human settlement. Its population is unknown but is believed to be decreasing. It does, however, inhabit a few protected areas.

Skagit Bay is a bay and strait located in the U.S. state of Washington. It is part of the Whidbey Island Basin of Puget Sound. The Skagit River empties into Skagit Bay. To the south, Skagit Bay connects with the rest of Puget Sound via Saratoga Passage and Possession Sound. The boundary between Saratoga Passage and Skagit Bay is between Polnell Point on Whidbey Island and Rocky Point on Camano Island. To the northwest, Skagit Bay connects to the Strait of Juan de Fuca via the narrow strait of Deception Pass. A third waterway, the Swinomish Channel, connects Skagit Bay with Padilla Bay to the north.
Skagit Bay is bounded by Whidbey Island to the west, Fidalgo Island to the north, Camano Island to the south, and the mainland to the east. The mainland coast consists almost entirely of the Skagit River delta, including Fir Island, between the North Fork and South Fork distributaries of the Skagit River.
The northern end of Skagit Bay is called Similk Bay. Two islands at the northern end, Hope and Skagit islands, have been designated as marine state parks. The Swinomish Indian Reservation is located on Fidalgo Island at the north end of Skagit Bay, between Similk Bay and the Swinomish Channel.
History
The bay is in an area occupied for thousands of years by various cultures of indigenous peoples. They made use of the bay to gather fish and shellfish, integral to their diets.
Members of the 1792 Vancouver Expedition were the first non-indigenous people recorded as having come upon and explored Skagit Bay. On May 30, 1792, Joseph Whidbey led a boat survey team up Saratoga Passage and into Skagit Bay. They spent a day surveying but did not see Deception Pass, and concluded that Skagit Bay was closed.
The next day George Vancouver noted the swampy waterway connecting Port Susan to Skagit Bay at the north end of Camano Island. Later, on June 7, Vancouver's ships passed by Deception Pass from the west. Peter Puget and Joseph Whidbey took boats to investigate the opening and found it connected to Skagit Bay, thus they realized the land (to be known as Whidbey Island) comprised an island rather than a peninsula.

The SFI Group System is the most widely used classification system for the maritime and offshore industry worldwide. It is an international standard, which provides a functional subdivision of technical and financial ship or rig information.
SFI consists of a technical account structure covering all aspects of ship/rig specification, and it can be used as a basic standard for all systems in the shipping/offshore industry.
More than 6000 SFI systems have been installed worldwide.
SFI is used by shipping and offshore companies, shipyards, consultancies, software suppliers, authorities and classification societies.
Background, Purpose, and Advantages
Background
The SFI Group System was first released in 1972 as the result of a research project undertaken by the Ship Research Institute of Norway (SFI: Skipsteknisk Forskningsinstitutt). Today, sales, marketing and upgrading of the SFI Group System is undertaken by SpecTec.
Purpose and Advantages
The main purpose of the SFI Group System is to help shipping and offshore companies control operations by tying together all their procedures such as purchasing, accounting, maintenance, technical records, etc.
The SFI Group System provides major advantages for shipping and offshore operations in the following areas:
Communication
Computerisation
Cooperation
Cost Control
Cost Comparison
Development
Education and Training
Quality Control
Standardisation
Scope
When the SFI Group System was established, the intention was that it should be capable of accommodating all relevant ship or rig types, and it should be a common code for the flow of information between different enterprises within the maritime and offshore industry.
The system should be independent of company organization and methods of ship building, ship operation, maintenance and repair. It should further lend itself to be updated with regard to new ship types and new technology. In order to meet the purpose of and the requirements to the system, the ships were divided into functions. The ship functions are common to all parties who are concerned with the specification, building and operation of ships.
In addition to the Group System with Detail Code, it may be necessary for each user to develop special codes, such as plan of finance accounts for budgeting and cost control of total company operation.
Shipyards using the SFI Group System for planning and control of production will require a supplementary company internal Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
Shipping companies using the SFI Group System for operation and maintenance planning and control, will require a coding system for consumables.
The Problems SFI Can Solve
Controlling Shipping and Offshore Operations
The SFI Group System improves the control and quality assurance of activities such as maintenance, purchasing, accounting and record keeping within shipping and offshore operations.
SFI provides shipping and offshore companies, shipyards, authorities, suppliers and consultants with a common plan of technical account/codes in the handling of:
Specifications
Estimates
Drawings
Purchase
Material Administration
Maintenance and Repair Planning
Instruction Material
Budgets and Cost Control
Files
The areas of system utilization are steadily increasing, and the system has contributed to increased efficiency in the maritime industry. The SFI Group Systemis a particularly useful tool when routines are being established according to the quality loop (ref. ISO 9004, par. 5.1).
Specifications
Specifications are normally established at different levels of detail: Outline, Contract, Building, As Built and Repair Specifications. Technical descriptions of components should be part of the As Built Specification and should follow the SFI Detail Code.
The database version of the Group System lends itself especially well to the development of the various specifications. A report generator makes it easy for the user to edit specifications according to requirements.
Specifications may be related to different Group System levels.
Outline specifications to Primary Group level
Functional requirements to Secondary Group level
Functional solutions to Tertiary Group level
Component selections to Detail Code level
Estimates
As estimates are based on specifications, they should follow the same breakdown structure. The estimates normally contain cost of material and working hours:
Drawings and Document Handling
Drawings can easily be numbered according to SFI, and complex drawings in CAD systems may be split into layers to show individual installations according to the SFI Group System.
Drawing identification may incorporate a SFI Group System number. A standard drawing number may be composed as follows:
179-731-001
Ship no. – SFI tertiary group no. – Consecutive no.
Drawings should be numbered according to the group level if possible. The Primary and Secondary Group levels are usually used for system and arrangement drawings:
179-100-000: General arrangement
179-200-001: Profile and deck plan
179-350-000: Loading and discharging system
179-446-001: Engine stores arrangement
Item lists on arrangement drawings may also be coded according to the SFI Group System.
Purchasing
A purchase is normally charged to a finance account (cost type) and to a SFI Group System number, often called a technical account (cost center).
When purchasing components, a yard may specify the individual item by the SFI Detail Code (6 digits). When a shipping company orders spare parts, these may be identified by the SFI Detail Code + consecutive numbers (total of 9-10 digits).
Material Administration
When components are purchased directly to order/ship, the SFI Detail Code may be used as a technical account.
The spare part manufacturer may have its own numbering system. For a shipping company it is often convenient to establish a spare part numbering system comprising the SFI Detail Code + consecutive numbers:
731.001 - Starting air compressor
731.001.001 - HP cylinder
731.001.002 - LP cylinder
731.001.003 - HP cylinder cover
731.001.004 - LP cylinder cover
Maintenance
An operation and maintenance system will often contain a register covering all maintenance units on board. These units are normally identical to the components in the Detail Code:
731.001.01 - Starting air compressor no. 1
Maker:
Type:
Serial no.:
Capacity:
Procedures for preventive maintenance and class survey of a maintenance unit will be entered with job identification:
731.001.01 - Starting air compressor no. 1
Job A - 3000 hours routine
Job B - Class survey
All records of preventive and corrective maintenance should be filed and related to the maintenance unit. The technical accounts of planned maintenance systems such as AMOS Maintenance and Procurement are commonly based on the SFI Group System.
Repair
Repair specifications are often based on information from the maintenance system. The repair bill should follow the repair specification structure. It is customary for the yard to quote prices to the shipping company at subgroup level.
Operation Budget
The SFI Group System is used for budgeting of maintenance and repair work, and for spare part consumption. In order to make a complete operation budget in a shipping company, it is necessary to link the Group System to a plan of finance accounts. Any suitable plan of finance accounts may be used together with SFI.
The plan of finance accounts usually covers spare parts and consumable items. Budgeting of spare parts may be performed in great detail using the SFI Group System.
Cost Control
Cost control of new building or repair work is normally carried out at the tertiary Group and Detail Code levels. Direct purchases are charged to the SFI Detail Code:
Materials:
Reporting of working hours is normally carried out at the tertiary group level. Activities and jobs must be established to follow up work progress.
Materials:
Quality Assurance
In relation to ISO 9000 and IMO requirements for safe operation, it is necessary to establish procedures that ensure that specification requirements and rules and regulations from authorities and classification societies are met, and that the ship/rig is operated safely.
The following procedures and instructions should be classified according to SFI:
Surveyor's manual
Installation description
Filing
The SFI Group System is often used as a standard filing system for the shipping and offshore industry. SFI gives this industry a well structured and organized filing system for drawings, manuals, reports, and publications.
Testing and commissioning procedures
Operating, start and stop manuals
Maintenance instructions

The Coding Structure of SFI
SFI Group System (3-digit)
The SFI Group System is built up as a 3-digit decimal classification system. The ship/rig is divided into 10 Primary Groups from 0 to 9. Only Primary Groups 1 to 8 are in use. The users may use Primary Groups 0 and 9 for classifying other main components that are not covered by the SFI standard.
Each of the Primary Groups (1st digit) consists of 10 Groups (2nd digit) and each Group is divided further into 10 subgroups (3rd digit).
The Primary Groups (1st digit) of SFI for Ships is described below.
Primary Group 1 - General
Details and costs that cannot be charged to any specific function on board, e.g. general arrangement, quality assurance, launching, dry-docking and guarantee
work.
Primary Group 2 - Hull Systems
Hull, superstructure and material protection of the vessel.
Primary Group 3 - Cargo Equipment
Cargo equipment and machinery including systems for vessel's cargo, loading/discharging systems, cargo winches and hatches.
Primary Group 4 - Ship Equipment
Ship specific equipment- and machinery. Navigational equipment, manoeuvring machinery, anchoring equipment, and communication equipment. This group also includes special equipment such as equipment for fishing.
Primary Group 5 - Crew and Passenger Equipment
Equipment, machinery, systems etc. serving crew and passengers, for example lifesaving equipment, furniture, catering equipment and sanitary systems.
Primary Group 6 - Machinery Main Components
Primary components in the engine room, for example main601.000 and auxiliary651.000 engines, propellers, plant, boilers, and generators.
Primary Group 7 - Systems for Machinery Main Components
Systems serving main machinery components, for example fuel and lubrication oil systems, starting air system, exhaust systems and automation systems.
Primary Group 8 - Common Systems
Central ship systems, for example ballast and bilge systems, fire fighting and wash down systems, electrical distribution systems etc.
SFI Detail and Material Codes (6 digit)
The detail and material codes cover components and materials that may be related to the individual subgroups. In order to reach the component level, it might be necessary to break the subgroups further down by using a detail code. This code has not yet been possible to standardize due to the variety of equipment and numbers onboard different types of ships, and due to slightly different requirements to the code for shipyards and shipping companies.
Usually there are two different classes of components and material that are used; one class comprises components and material that are ordered directly to a ship, the other comprises components and material that are ordered to stock. Consequently, the codes are divided into two parts:
Detail Code: Components that are purchased directly to order/ship. The detail code is used to define the individual component and equipment that acts in the sub system function. In the Detail Code the supplementary codes are built up from 001-099.
Material Code: This code relates to material that is purchased to stock.
The relations between these codes are as follows:
SFI Group System + Detail Code: 731.000 – 731.099
SFI Group System + Material Code: 731.100 – 731.999
User Rights for the SFI Group System
SFI User License
An SFI User License Certificate must be purchased from SpecTec to use the SFI Group System. One license fee will be charged for each SFI installation. This means that one license is required for each ship/site/rig that uses the coding structure of SFI. There are additional charges for each book, file or database.
Formats of the SFI Group System
SFI Manuals
The SFI manuals are available in the following formats:
A4

Conclusion
A classification system such as the SFI Group System will make a substantial contribution to standardized and well-ordered information related to ship/rigs, and will lead to improved communication both within a company and with external parties.
The SFI Group System will make shipping and offshore operations more efficient because companies will save resources and avoid pitfalls when implementing the SFI standards. SFI can be the common denominator tying together all functions of shipping and offshore operations such as maintenance, purchasing, accounting, filing etc.

Alipurduar University is a public university which was established by an Act of the West Bengal government notified on 2018. It is a newly established affiliating university in the Alipurduar, West Bengal.
History
In 1947, India got independence but with a painful partition on the religious line. This partition led to the migration of a huge number of displaced people to the Dooars areas. Higher education for the children of these uprooted poverty-stricken people was of utmost necessity to change their fortune. In 1956 under the Refugee Rehabilitation and Development Programme of the Union Government, a local committee led by Late N. K. Mukherjee moved to the government for an establishment of undergraduate degree College at the Alipurduar town. G.B. Panth (union home minister of that time) also urged the Chief Minister of West Bengal Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy for setting up a sponsored Degree College at Alipurduar. Finally, this institution was formally established in 1957 as an affiliating college of the University of Calcutta.When the University of North Bengal was established in 1962 at this part of the West Bengal, the affiliation of the college changed from the University of Calcutta to the University of North Bengal. In 2018, West Bengal state government announced the decision to upgrade the Alipurduar College as a full-fledged university. Finally, Alipurduar University was formally established by an Act of the West Bengal legislature. It became active with the appointment of the first vice-chancellor, Mahendra Nath Roy, in 2020.

The Salt Palace was an indoor arena located in Salt Lake City, Utah. Built on land that was once the "Little Tokyo" area of the city, construction was pushed by Salt Lake's bid committee for the 1972 Winter Olympics, which included Gen. Maxwell E. Rich, president of the Greater Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce, Gov. Cal Rampton, and Salt Lake Tribune publisher John W. Gallivan.
Ground was broken for the county's "civic auditorium" in March 1967, and the Salt Palace opened in the summer of 1969 at a cost of $17 million with a seating capacity of 10,725. Later expanded to 12,666 seats, the venue was the home of the Utah Stars of the American Basketball Association from 1970 to 1975, the Salt Lake Golden Eagles hockey club from 1969 to 1991, and the NBA's Utah Jazz from 1979 to 1991.
From 1980 until the arena's closing, the arena was officially named the "Salt Palace Acord Arena" in memory of Thayne and Lorraine Acord. The elevation of the arena at street level was approximately above sea level.
In 1994, three years after the Jazz moved into the new Delta Center (now Vivint Arena), the Salt Palace was demolished. A convention center of the same name stands on the site today.
The first Salt Palace in the city was a theater and dance hall at 900 South, between State and Main streets; its exterior was sprayed with salt crystals to reflect the sun. The structure was lost to a fire in 1910.
Pro basketball
When the Los Angeles Stars of the ABA moved to Salt Lake City following the 1969–70 season, the Salt Palace had a major tenant. The Utah Stars were a major success initially, defeating the Kentucky Colonels in the ABA Finals and capturing the ABA Championship in 1970–71, behind Finals MVP Zelmo Beaty. The Stars set an ABA attendance record in that season (6,100 per game), and would continue to draw well and field excellent teams in the following seasons. The team reached the ABA Finals again in 1973–74, before losing to the New York Nets and Julius Erving.
Moses Malone was selected in the 1974 ABA Draft and joined the team directly out of high school. However, the franchise declined with a season in despite drawing 8,500 fans per game. Financial problems plagued owners of the franchise in 1975 and the team folded on December 2 (4–12 record), after the franchise could not make payroll.
Less than six months later on May 19, the ABA Spirits of St. Louis announced that they planned to relocate to Salt Lake City and the Salt Palace as the Utah Rockies for the 1976–77 season. However, negotiations for the ABA-NBA merger were completed and the Spirits/Rockies were one of two ABA teams disbanded in the merger. The fan support that the Stars received established Salt Lake City as a viable basketball market, setting the stage for the NBA's New Orleans Jazz to relocate and become the Utah Jazz in 1979.
The final regular season game in the Salt Palace was a 107–93 win over the Los Angeles Lakers on April 20, 1991. Its final NBA game was in the second round of the playoffs, a three-point loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, 104–101 on May 12.

Concert deaths
In 1991, three teenagers were killed at an AC/DC rock concert at the Salt Palace on January 18. When AC/DC took the stage, the crowd rushed towards the stage, trampling the three. Security guards tried to get the band to stop playing but failed to quickly communicate the extent of the dire situation leading AC/DC to play for about 20 minutes before the band learned people were hurt or dying. The band stopped playing as soon as they discovered what had happened. Blame was pointed at several different groups, including the fans, the band, the security personnel, and the Salt Palace's festival seating arrangement. The families of the victims sued AC/DC, as well as other groups associated with the concert, in connection with the deaths, and eventually settled out of court.

Pseudoalcippe is a genus of passerine birds in the family Sylviidae that are found in Africa.
The genus was erected by the English ornithologist David Armitage Bannerman in 1923. The type species is the Ruwenzori hill babbler.
The genus contains two species:
African hill babbler (Pseudoalcippe abyssinica)
Rwenzori hill babbler (Pseudoalcippe atriceps)
These two species were previously considered as members of the family Timaliidae (Old World babblers) but molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that they are closely related to species belonging to the genus Sylvia in the family Sylviidae. Some taxonomists now place both species in Sylvia.

Theopetra Cave is a limestone cave located in Theopetra village of Meteora municipality, Thessaly, Greece. It is situated on the northeast side of a limestone rock formation that is south of Kalambaka. The site has become increasingly important as human presence is attributed to all periods of the Middle and Upper Paleolithic, the Mesolithic, Neolithic and beyond, bridging the Pleistocene with the Holocene.
Description
Radiocarbon evidence shows for human presence at least 50,000 years ago. Excavations began in 1987 under the direction of Ν. Kyparissi-Apostolika, which were meant to answer questions about Paleolithic Thessaly.
Several features of the cave indicate human occupation.
Theopetra Cave contains one of the longest archaeological sequences in Greece, comprising Middle and Upper Palaeolithic as well as Mesolithic and Neolithic cultural remains. The records have shown important palaeoenvironmental data based on sedimentary features and botanical remains.
Findings include a human-made stone wall that is still standing today, which was built in approximately 21,000 BCE. It is the oldest known example of a human-made structure. The wall is thought to have been built to protect its residents from cold winds at the height of the last ice age.
Geologically, the formation of the limestone rock has been dated to the Upper Cretaceous period, 135–65 million years BP.
Archaeogenetics
In 2016, researchers successfully extracted the DNA from the tibia of two individuals buried in Theopetra Cave. Both individuals were found in a Mesolithic burial context and separately dated to 7288–6771 BC and 7605–7529 BC. Both individuals were found to belong to mtDNA Haplogroup K1c.
Access
The cave is located just to the north, within walking distance, of the center of Theopetra village. The Theopetra Cave Museum () is located in the village.
Nearby, the ruins of the Monastery of St. Theodore () are located just to the south of Theopetra village, near the village of Agii Theodori (Άγιοι Θεόδωροι).

Meta learning is a branch of metacognition concerned with learning about one's own learning and learning processes.
The term comes from the meta prefix's modern meaning of an abstract recursion, or "X about X", similar to its use in metaknowledge, metamemory, and meta-emotion.
Overview
Meta learning is originally described by Donald B. Maudsley (1979) as "the process by which learners become aware of and increasingly in control of habits of perception, inquiry, learning, and growth that they have internalized". Maudsley sets the conceptual basis of their theory as synthesized under headings of assumptions, structures, change process, and facilitation. Five principles were enunciated to facilitate meta learning. Learners must:
(a) have a theory, however primitive;
(b) work in a safe supportive social and physical environment;
(c) discover their rules and assumptions;
(d) reconnect with reality-information from the environment; and
(e) reorganize themselves by changing their rules/assumptions.
The idea of meta learning was later used by John Biggs (1985) to describe the state of "being aware of and taking control of one's own learning". Meta learning can be defined as an awareness and understanding of the phenomenon of learning itself as opposed to subject knowledge. Implicit in this definition is the learner's perception of the learning context, which includes knowing what the expectations of the discipline are and, more narrowly, the demands of a given learning task.
Within this context, meta learning depends on the learner's conceptions of learning, epistemological beliefs, learning processes and academic skills, summarized here as a "learning approach". A student who has a high level of meta learning awareness is able to assess the effectiveness of their learning approach and regulate it according to the demands of the learning task. Conversely, a student who is low in meta learning awareness will not be able to reflect on their learning approach or the nature of the learning task set. In consequence, the student will be unable to adapt successfully when studying becomes more difficult and demanding.
Conceptually, meta learning is a mixture of understanding, processes, and attitudes. It includes the self-knowledge about how one learns, particularly an awareness of the learning strategies and behaviors applicable to a learning context (Jackson 2004; Boström and Lassen 2006). It also includes 'knowledge of completion', in which learners develop an appreciation of the knowledge that they have gained and an understanding of how to use this knowledge (Boström and Lassen 2006). Meta learning also relates to learners' attitudes, such as their belief that the way they self-regulate is the best way for them, and that they have the capacities and skills to apply their knowledge (Jackson 2004).
Based on this perspective, meta learning is an active, internal process in which a learner's point of view regarding themselves and their surroundings will change and be regulated (Boström and Lassen 2006; Winters 2011). Engaging effectively in meta learning has been shown to improve academic performance (Biggs 1985). It has been suggested that aiding the metacognition of learning can help students to become more effective learners, as they become more aware of self-regulatory behaviours and begin to recognise the effectiveness of various strategies they use (Jackson 2004). Meta learning can also be a very effective tool to assist students in becoming independently self-reflective (Biggs 1985; Winters 2011). As meta learning relates to students' self-awareness regarding their learning processes, it is closely aligned to the self-regulation of learning (Zimmerman 2002; Winne 2010); that is, the thoughts, feelings and actions that students use to help them attain their academic goals (Zimmerman 2000).
Meta learning model for teams and relationships
Marcial Losada and other researchers have attempted to create a meta learning model to analyze teams and relationships. A 2013 paper provided a strong critique of this attempt, arguing that it was based on misapplication of complex mathematical modelling. This led to its abandonment by at least one former proponent.
The meta learning model proposed by Losada is identical to the Lorenz system, which was originally proposed as a simplified mathematical model for atmospheric convection. It comprises one control parameter and three state variables, which in this case have been mapped to "connectivity", "inquiry-advocacy", "positivity-negativity", and "other-self" (external-internal focus) respectively. The state variables are linked by a set of nonlinear differential equations. This has been criticized as a poorly defined, poorly justified, and invalid application of differential equations.
Losada and colleagues claim to have arrived at the meta learning model from thousands of time series data generated at two human interaction laboratories in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Cambridge, Massachusetts, although the details of the collection of this data, and the connection between the time series data and the model is unclear. These time series portrayed the interaction dynamics of business teams doing typical business tasks such as strategic planning. These teams were classified into three performance categories: high, medium and low. Performance was evaluated by the profitability of the teams, the level of satisfaction of their clients, and 360-degree evaluations.
One proposed result of this theory is that there is a ratio of positivity-to-negativity of at least 2.9 (called the Losada line), which separates high from low performance teams as well as flourishing from languishing in individuals and relationships. Brown and colleagues pointed out that even if the proposed meta-learning model were valid, this ratio results from a completely arbitrary choice of model parameters carried over from the literature on modeling atmospheric convection by Lorenz and others, without any justification.
Ideas for implementation and goals
Meta learning can also be a very effective tool to assist students in becoming independently self-reflective. Students will require feedback in order to reflect on their learning, strengths, and weaknesses. Meta learning tasks will help students be more proactive and effective learners by focusing on developing self-awareness. Meta learning tasks would provide students with the opportunity to better understand their thinking processes in order to devise custom learning strategies. The goal is to find a set of parameters that work well across different tasks so that learners start with a bias that allows them to perform well despite receiving only a small amount of task-specific data.
Tim Ferriss's DiSSS System
Tim Ferriss created a four stem system which they argue can be used to learn anything.
a. Deconstruction: Breaking down a skill, what are the bare minimum learnable components?
b. Selection: Which 20% of these components should be focused on to give 80% of the desired outcomes?
c. Sequencing: In what order should these units be learned to maximize outcomes and avoid failure?
d. Stakes: What stakes can be created to push past difficulties and guarantee completion of learning?

Lora H. Reinbold (born April 30, 1964 in Fairbanks, Alaska) is an American politician who is a member of the Alaska Senate. They were a member of the Alaska House from 2013 to 2019, representing District 26. Reinbold is the only member of the Alaska State Legislature who is unaffiliated with a caucus organization, as they were ejected from the Republican-led majority caucus in March 2015.
Early life
Reinbold was born in Fairbanks, Alaska in 1964. Them family moved from Clear to Anchorage when they were about five years old. They graduated from East Anchorage High School in 1982. Reinbold earned their BS in business administration from Oral Roberts University in 1987. They also attended the University of Alaska Anchorage in 1985 and 2001.
Career
Health care
Reinbold worked as an operations manager at Medical Park Family Care. They also worked as an office manager at NME Hospitals (now Tenet Healthcare), a district manager for Bristol Myers Squibb, and a salesperson for Johnson & Johnson/Centecor Pharmaceuticals.
Legislature
On March 13, 2015, Reinbold voted against an operating budget put forward by the House majority caucus, in violation of caucus rules. They argued that the draft budget did not make steep enough cuts to the University of Alaska system and was, in effect, not conservative enough. On March 16, the Republican leadership of the state House (Speaker Mike Chenault, Craig Johnson, and Charisse Millett) removed Reinbold from the majority caucus for their vote and stripped them of most of their committee assignments. Them office staff was also cut from four to one.
On April 27, 2015, Reinbold voted against the operating budget again. The dissenters left the majority caucus short of the three-fourths majority needed to approve tapping Alaska's budget reserve to cover a $3.2 million deficit.
COVID-19
COVID-19 diagnosis
On October 12, 2021, Reinbold posted on their Facebook page that they had tested positive for COVID-19.
Alaska Airlines ban
In November 2020, Reinbold refused to resume wearing a mask after eating during a flight. An Alaska Airlines policy, as well as a federal regulation, required passengers to wear masks except while eating or drinking. They wrote on social media, "Mask bullies in full force on Alaskans Airlines- all because a scaredy cat Karen whined loudly and was a Tattle tail when I took my dumb worthless suffocating mask off, a bit longer than they wanted, for my food and drink." The airline's policy followed the Centers for Disease Control's recommendations. In April 2021, Alaska Airlines banned Reinbold from its flights, citing "her continued refusal to comply with employee instruction regarding the current mask policy."
In April 2021, shortly after the ban, Reinbold traveled to Juneau overland through Canada and then by marine ferry. In September 2021, Reinbold said they could not reach Juneau because the only other air route from Anchorage to Juneau (a Delta flight that connected in Seattle) is seasonal and discontinued that month; Alaska Airlines is the only carrier that makes the route year-round. They sought permission to be excused from attending the legislative session.
Promotion of COVID-19 disinformation and opposition to COVID-19 health measures
Reinbold has frequently posted COVID-19 misinformation on Facebook, where they promote the use of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and expresses vehement opposition to face-covering and vaccine mandates. In November 2020, Reinbold said that they did not believe clinical evidence in support of masks' effectiveness at preventing the spread of COVID-19. They disagreed with Governor Mike Dunleavy, who wrote, "It is lamentable that the good citizens of Eagle River and Chugiak are deprived of meaningful representation by the actions of the person holding the office of Senator." They continued, "I will not continue to subject the public resources of the State of Alaska to the mockery of a charade, disguised as public purpose." Reinbold has criticized Dunleavy for issuing pandemic-related disaster declarations during a period when the legislature was not in session, and has protested health restrictions imposed by local governments, airlines and the legislature, including mask requirements.
Reinbold has also had combative exchanges with Alaska's health commissioner. As Senate Judiciary Committee chair, they held hearings highlighting testimony from witnesses who questioned masks' usefulness and the consequences of government emergency orders. Though the committee has had no COVID-19-related legislation before it, the pandemic has become a major focus in hearings.
Despite the recommendations of Alaska health officials who have said that wearing masks and following measures like social distancing help slow the spread of COVID-19, Reinbold has accused Dunleavy's administration of being "wild" about what they termed "these experimental" COVID-19 vaccines and "bragging over 100,000 Alaskans have gotten them", and characterized the administration as seeking disaster declarations in order to get mass vaccination clinics.
Removal of committee chairpersonship and Capitol ban
On March 8, 2021, Reinbold left a Senate subcommittee meeting after the chair told them that they were required to wear a mask. The next day, Capitol security escorted them out of a House Health and Social Services Committee meeting because they refused to wear a mask. They were banned from most of the Capitol until they follow the COVID-19 rules.
On April 19, 2021, members of the Alaska Senate removed Reinbold as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee by a 17–1 vote.
Elections
2012 redistricting combined the Eagle River Valley and Southfork portions of former District 32 (represented by Republican Mike Hawker) and a portion of former District 17 (represented by Republican Anna Fairclough), creating a new District 26. Anna Fairclough, the new district's only incumbent resident, chose to run instead for a newly configured Senate seat, leaving the new District 26 seat open. Reinbold won the three-way August 28 Republican primary with 1,610 votes (46.15%), and won the November 6 general election with 6,903 votes (72.53%) against Democratic nominee Roberta Goughnour.
Personal life
Reinbold is married to Eric Reinbold. They have two children.

Richard Bruce Silverman (born May 12, 1946) is the Patrick G. Ryan/Aon Professor of Chemistry at Northwestern University. Their group's main focus is basic and translational research into central nervous system disorders and cancer.  They are known for the discovery of pregabalin, which is marketed by Pfizer under the brand name Lyrica.
Education
Silverman attended Central High School of Philadelphia. Silverman received their B.S. in chemistry from Pennsylvania State University in 1968. They spent one semester at Harvard University before being drafted and serving as a United States Army Physical Sciences Assistant at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research from January 1969 until their honorable discharge in January 1971. In June 1974, they received their Ph.D. from Harvard University in organic chemistry with advisor David Dolphin. They then spent two years as a postdoctoral fellow with Robert Abeles in biochemistry at Brandeis University.
Research
Silverman has been teaching and doing research at Northwestern since 1976. They became both Professor of Chemistry and Professor of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology in 1986. They have held several named professorships. They were the Arthur Andersen Professor of Chemistry from 1988 to 1996, the Charles Deering McCormick Professor of Teaching Excellence from 2001 to 2003, and the John Evans Professor of Chemistry beginning from 2004 to 2015. They were named the inaugural Patrick G. Ryan/Aon Professor as of September 1, 2015.
The primary focus in Silverman's laboratory is basic research into central nervous system disorders, including Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and epilepsy. Other research areas include cancer (melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma), and bacterial infection. They have developed novel approaches to the elucidation of enzyme-catalyzed reactions in organic chemistry.  They are interested in understanding and developing mechanisms of enzyme inhibition.
Silverman has published over 385 research articles. They have been awarded 128 patents. They have written 3 books: Mechanism-Based Enzyme Inactivation: Chemistry and Enzymology (CRC Press; 1988), Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action (Academic Press; 1992, 2004, 2014), and Organic Chemistry of Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions (Academic Press; 2000, 2002; see the Published works section, below).  They are active on the editorial boards of a number of scholarly journals.
Silverman is known for inventing the drug pregabalin as a possible treatment for epileptic seizures. During 1988-1990, Ryszard Andruszkiewicz, a visiting research fellow, synthesized a series of molecules for Silverman. One looked promising. The molecule was transported into the brain, where it activated the enzyme L-glutamate decarboxylase. Silverman anticipated that the enzyme would increase production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and block convulsions. Eventually, the set of molecules were sent to Parke-Davis Pharmaceuticals for testing. In addition to treating seizures, pregabalin was found to be effective in treating fibromyalgia pain, neuropathic pain, and generalized anxiety disorder. It was approved by the FDA in 2004 and marketed by Pfizer (which bought Parke-Davis) under the trade name Lyrica.
Research has shown that the mechanism of the drug is more complicated than originally anticipated. In addition to its effects on GABA-AT substrate behavior, pregabalin binds to calcium channels and blocks glutamate release. GABA is potentiated, but through a different mechanism than originally suspected.

This article lists the highest-attended concerts of all time. The oldest 100,000-crowd concert reported to Billboard Boxscore is Grateful Dead's gig at the Raceway Park, Englishtown, New Jersey on September 3, 1977. The concert was attended by 107,019 people, which remains the largest ticketed concert in the United States to date. Frank Sinatra, Tina Turner, and Paul McCartney broke the record respectively in Maracanã Stadium. With an audience of over 184,000 people on April 21, 1990. McCartney's record was broken by a Japanese rock band, Glay, which held a concert with an audience of 200,000 people on July 31, 1999, in Chiba, Japan (Makuhari Parking Lot). GLAY held the record for 6 years. Italian singer Vasco Rossi surpassed the record with their solo concert on July 1, 2017. The concert was a celebration of their 40 years of career.
Although the attendance numbers of free concerts are known to be exaggerations, several concerts have been reported to have a million audience or more. Both Jean-Michel Jarre's concert in Moscow 1997 and Rod Stewart's concert in Copacabana 1994 have been reported to attract audiences of more than 3.5 million people. Jean-Michel Jarre has attracted a live audience of more than a million spectators on five occasions, three times in Paris, 1979, 1990 and 1995, once in Houston, 1986, and once in Moscow, 1997.  They are the only artist ever to have done so. Metallica played Moscow in 1991 in front of 1.6 million people.

Playing to Win is the eighth studio album by Australian group, Little River Band released on Capitol Records. This album is the second studio album with John Farnham as lead vocalist and the first to be recorded by the band in the United States. The album peaked at No. 38 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart and at No. 75 on The Billboard 200.
The title song, "Playing to Win", had been drafted by Farnham. By the time it had been through LRB production, every member of the band had a share. Band member Graham Goble analysed the lyrics to determine who contributed, and what percentage of royalties they deserved. Farnham eventually received 55.5% of the royalties.
The first single from the album was "Playing to Win", which was released in November 1984 and reached No.59 on the Australian Singles Chart, No. 15 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart and No. 60 on The Billboard Hot 100. Channel 7 used "Playing to Win" as its football promo for its VFL coverage in early 1985. The second single, "Blind Eyes", failed to enter any chart.
The album was re-released on CD in March 1997 with bonus tracks.

Thomas Matthias Klapötke (born 24 February 1961 in Göttingen) is a German inorganic chemist at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, studying explosives.
Klapötke grew up in Berlin and studied at the Technical University of Berlin (TU Berlin), completing their undergraduate degree in 1982, their PhD in 1986, and their habilitation in 1990. Klapötke worked as a lecturer at TU Berlin until 1995, when the University of Glasgow hired them for the Ramsay professorship. Since 1997, Klapötke has worked at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU) as a professor of Inorganic Chemistry.
Klapötke's lab at the University of Munich is a group of about 30 employees, mainly studying explosives. Klapötke's goal is to generate "green" explosives, that either burn to completion or leave few toxic residues. Die Zeit called it "the only university laboratory in Germany investigating implements of war". For this reason, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution watches Klapötke's lab quite closely. Klapötke is funded both by the German federal government and the US military and has won a number of awards, including the 1986 Schering Prize.
Klapötke is a vegetarian.

The hall boy or hallboy was a position held by a young male domestic worker on the staff of a great house, usually a young teenager. The name derives from the fact that the hall boy usually slept in the servants' hall.
Like their female counterpart, the scullery maid, the hall boy would have been expected to work up to 16 hours per day, seven days per week. Their duties were often among the most disagreeable in the house, such as emptying chamber pots for the higher-ranking servants. In the absence of a boot boy, they also cleaned the boots not just of the family members but also those of the butler and those of the visitors. The hall boy also waited on more senior servants when they took their meals in the servants hall.
The hall boy was the lowest-ranked male servant, but they could rise to a higher position in the household, eventually becoming a valet or butler. Arthur Inch, a former butler who acted as a technical consultant for the film Gosford Park and the television series Downton Abbey, stated in an interview that they began their life in service as a hall boy at the age of 15.

After being adopted, Hana was regularly spanked, locked in a closet, and denied food as punishment. They were not allowed to wear clothes, only a towel. They were also forced to sleep in a barn and take showers with a garden hose.
According to a memorial statement posted by their adoptive parents on the Lemley Chapel website, Williams "enjoyed knitting and crocheting, reading, drawing and various crafts, playing soccer and riding them bicycle." It is possible that they were homeschooled by Carri.
In addition to being the adoptive parents of Williams and an Ethiopian boy, Carri and Larry have seven biological children. The children reported the abuse to CPS 2 weeks after Hana's death, when CPS returned to the home to investigate. At Carri and Larry's trial in 2013, their other adopted child and some of their biological children testified to the abuse. Carri Williams, convicted of
homicide by abuse and first-degree assault of a child, was sentenced to 36 years and 11 months in prison. Larry Williams, convicted of first-degree manslaughter and first-degree assault of a child, was sentenced to 27 years and nine months in prison.
Controversy regarding Train Up a Child
Williams's adoptive parents had a copy of the controversial parenting book To Train Up a Child by Michael and Debi Pearl, which encourages child abuse. They had also given a copy of the book to an acquaintance, according to investigators.
On their website, Michael Pearl responded to the deaths of Hana Williams, Sean Paddock, and Lydia Schatz by noting that "we share in the sadness over the tragic death of Hana Williams", but also that "I laugh at my caustic critics, for our properly-spanked and trained children grow to maturity in great peace and love" who become "entrepreneurs that pay the taxes your children will receive in entitlements." They made no comment on who paid the taxes for the prosecution and incarceration of the people who used their book as inspiration for child murder.
Pearl spoke to the media about the controversy, stating that because the plastic tubing they recommend in the book is of a certain size, they are not responsible when parents who follow their lead use tubing that they believe is too big and end up murdering their children. Pearl also stated, "What their parents did is diametrically opposed to the philosophy of No Greater Joy Ministries and what is taught in the book." The New York Times claimed that the Williamses took the book's advice, particularly the Pearls' recommendation that parents starve their children by claiming that "a little fasting is good training", to extremes. A witness in the trial reported that the Williamses followed the book's recommendations "to use a switch, cold baths, withhold food and force children outside in cold weather as punishment," all of which were used on Williams.

War Paint is a 1926 American silent Western film directed by W. S. Van Dyke. The film stars Tim McCoy. Louis B. Mayer observed the profits made by other studios with western franchises such as Tom Mix, Buck Jones or Hoot Gibson. They selected a genuine army officer who had lived with Indian tribes to come to Hollywood as an advisor on 1922's The Covered Wagon: Colonel Timothy John Fitzgerald McCoy. Their debut as Tim McCoy in War Paint was announced under the banner "He's the real McCoy!" In order to maximize the economics, the film was shot simultaneously on location with another film, Winners of the Wilderness. The film is considered lost. A trailer however is preserved at the Library of Congress.

Tiotropium bromide, sold under the brand name Spiriva among others, is a long-acting bronchodilator (LAMA: long acting muscarinic antagonist) used in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Specifically it is used during periods of breathing difficulty to prevent them from getting worse, rather than to prevent them from happening. It is used by inhalation through the mouth. Onset typically begins within half an hour and lasts for 24 hours.
Common side effects include a dry mouth, runny nose, upper respiratory tract infection, shortness of breath and headache. Severe side effects may include angioedema, worsening bronchospasm, and QT prolongation. Tentative evidence has not found harm during pregnancy, however, such use has not been well studied. It is an anticholinergic medication and works by blocking acetylcholine action on smooth muscle.
Tiotropium was patented in 1989, and approved for medical use in 2002. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2019, it was the 132nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5million prescriptions.
Medical uses
Tiotropium is used as maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It may also be used as an add-on therapy in people with moderate-to-severe asthma on medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). It is not however approved for acute exacerbations of COPD or acute worsening of asthma.
Tiotropium is also used in a combination inhaler with olodaterol, a long-acting beta-agonist, for the treatment of COPD, under the brand names Stiolto and Spiolto among others.
Adverse effects
Adverse effects are mainly related to its antimuscarinic effects. Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of people) include: dry mouth and/or throat irritation. Rarely (<0.1% of patients) treatment is associated with: urinary retention, constipation, acute angle closure glaucoma, palpitations (notably supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation) and allergy (rash, angioedema, anaphylaxis). A 2006 review found the increase in bronchospasm was small and did not reach statistical significance.
Data regarding some serious side effects is mixed as of 2020. In September 2008 a review found that tiotropium and another member of its class ipratropium may be linked to increased risk of heart attacks, stroke and cardiovascular death. The US FDA reviewed the concern and concluded in 2010 that this association was not supported. A 2011 review of the tiotropium mist inhaler (Respimat); however, still found an associated with an increase in all cause mortality in people with COPD.
Mechanism of action
Tiotropium is a muscarinic receptor antagonist, often referred to as an antimuscarinic or anticholinergic agent. Although it does not display selectivity for specific muscarinic receptors, when topically applied it acts mainly on M3 muscarinic receptors located on smooth muscle cells and submucosal glands. This leads to a reduction in smooth muscle contraction and mucus secretion and thus produces a bronchodilatory effect.
Society and culture
Tiotroprium is available in two inhaler formats: a soft mist inhaler (Respimat) and a dry powder inhaler (HandiHaler). The safety and efficacy profiles of both devices are comparable and people's preference should play a role in determining inhaler choice. There is no significant difference in all-cause mortality between tiotropium soft mist inhalers compared to dry powder inhalers, however caution needs to be taken in people with severe heart or kidney problems.

Frederick Villiers Meynell (24 March 1801 – 27 May 1872), known as Frederick Villiers during their political career, was a British Whig politician.
Villiers, or Meynell, was the natural son of a Mr Meynell and a Miss Hunlocke. Sponsored by the Villiers family, although not related to it, in early life they were known as Frederick Villiers. They were educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, where they became known as "Savage Villiers" (while Charles Villiers was "Civil Villiers") and was called to the Bar from Lincoln's Inn. They later adopted their biological father's surname of Meynell.
They were returned to parliament for the rotten borough of Saltash in 1832, but lost their seat the following year when the constituency was abolished in the Great Reform Act. In January 1835 they were elected for Canterbury. However, they were unseated on petition already in March of that year on the grounds that they had not enough real estate income and for having bribed the voters. They stood for the same constituency in 1837 but was heavily defeated. In 1841 they returned to the House of Commons when they were elected for Sudbury alongside David Ochterlony Dyce Sombre, who spent approximately £3,000 on the election. In parliament they notably spoke against the Corn Laws. However, in April 1842 their and Dyce Sombre's elections were declared void due to "gross, systematic and extensive bribery". In 1844 the constituency was disfranchised on the grounds of corruption.
They were later given a sinecure by Lord Chief Justice Sir Alexander Cockburn, a Cambridge contemporary, who appointed them a Registrar of Deeds for Middlesex. The actual work was done by a deputy.
Meynell died in May 1872, aged 71. They were buried in Haywards Heath, Sussex.

The crimson-backed tanager (Ramphocelus dimidiatus) is a species of bird in the family Thraupidae. It is found in Colombia, Panama, and Venezuela, and introduced to French Polynesia. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and heavily degraded former forest. A nickname in Panama is sangre de toro ("Blood of the bull").
The crimson-backed tanager was first described by French naturalist Frédéric de Lafresnaye in 1837. It is one of nine species of brightly coloured tanagers of the genus Ramphocelus. Mitochondrial DNA evidence indicates its closest relative is the masked crimson tanager (R. nigrogularis), and the two split around 800,000 years ago.
Measuring around in length, the adult male has a silver sheen on its lower mandible. Its whole head and chest are a maroon red, brightening to a bright red on its lower back and abdomen. Its wings and tail are black. The female is duller with blackish underparts.
It is found in northern and western Colombia (south to Chocó where it is uncommon), the Maracaibo Basin in Venezuela, and over most of Panama, where it extends to Chiriquí and Veraguas Provinces in the west of the country, as well as Coiba, where it is abundant, and Pearl Islands. It inhabits forest, scrub and gardens.
A nest with a clutch of two blue eggs with fine dark dots has been recorded.
A field study on blood parasites found that two individual crimson-backed tanagers (out of twelve tested) bore Plasmodium, with the study concluding the overall rate was low compared with studies done elsewhere.

Chattisham is a village and civil parish in Suffolk, England. Located around two miles west of Ipswich and half a mile south of the A1071, it is part of Babergh district. In 2006 its population was 140, increasing to 167 at the 2011 Census. It is in the Belstead Brook electoral division of Suffolk County Council.
In the early 1870s, Chattisham was portrayed as:
"CHATTISHAM, a parish in Samford district, Suffolk; 2¼ miles NE of Raydon r. station, and 5 SW by W of Ipswich. Post town, Ipswich. Acres, 713. Real property, £1, 427. Pop., 192. Houses, 47. The property is divided among a few. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Norwich. Value, £168.* Patron, Eton College. The church has a brass of 1592; and is good. There are a Wesleyan chapel, and charities £6."
Population
Chattisham had a population of "167" according to the 2011 census."Chattisham can be considered less ethnically diverse than the UK average." Approximately 86% of the UK's population is white. In Chattisham, the white population accounts for 98% of the total population. There are four main ethnic groups in Chattisham including, white, mixed ethnicity, Indian and other Asian. Down below are the numbers for each section of ethnic group within Chattisham.
White: 163, Mixed ethnicity: 1, Indian: 2, Other Asian: 1, Total population: 167
Country of birth has a variation in Chattisham, with 146 people born in England, 4 born in Wales, 8 born in Scotland, 2 in the European union and 7 people born in other parts of the world. The people of Chattisham also have different beliefs in terms of religion. These beliefs have been categorised into five main sections, as stated below.
Christian: 116, No religion: 29, Hindu: 2, Other religion: 3, Not stated: 17, Total: 167
Since 1811, the population of Chattisham has encountered a fluctuation in numbers. The main trend of population data has a negative correlation, occurring overtime. The highest population recorded from the 1811 to 2011 censuses, was in 1831, with a population of 241 people. The lowest point in population numbers occurred in 1961, with the population being 108 people.
Housing
Housing types in Chattisham:
Detached: 56, Semi- detached: 10, Terraced: 1, Flat (purpose built): 0, Flat (converted): 3
Total: 70
Housing Tenures:
Owned outright: 32, owned with mortgage: 28, Shared ownership: 0, Rented from council: 1, Rented other social: 0, Rented private landlord: 7, Rented other: 1, Rent free: 0

The statistics for Chattisham's housing types and tenure's were taken from the 2011 census. The area contains many detached houses, with a number of '56'.
Chattisham contains no 'Flat (purpose built)' buildings and only 1 'Terraced' house. The 'Owned outright' category stands as the highest within the tenure listings. 'Shared ownership', 'Rented other social' and 'Rent free' were the lowest in the 2011 census, as these housing tenures did not exist in Chattisham. The housing statistics potentially illustrate that Chattisham has a stable economy.
Occupations and Economic activity
Overtime, the population of Chattisham has had a diverse range in job roles, as portrayed in the 1881 and 2011 data sets. From the 2011 census data of Chattisham, one person was unemployed. This can be seen as a positive for the village, as the other 127 people are involved in full/part-time jobs, study, care and retirement. This data does not include people under the age of 16. As shown in the 2011 employment industry chart, retail and manufacturing have the highest proportion of people. The industries with the lowest proportion of people include, 'Public administration & defence' and 'other'. This data set is based on resident's aged 16 to 74, on the 2011 census. The occupational statistics for 1881, suggest that 'agriculture' had the highest number of workers in total than any other sector. The agricultural sector mainly consisted of male workers, with an approximation of '45 males'. In 1881, '30 women' were under the sector 'Persons without specified occupants. In the late 1800s women were expected to stay at home while the men worked in labour based jobs, this is shown in the occupational graphs.
Education
There is a variation in qualifications achieved in Chattisham's population. Statistics for the qualifications achieved are taken from the 2011 census and are as shown.
Degree or similar: 50, Apprenticeship: 1, 2+ A levels: 18, 5+ GCSEs an A level or 1–2 AS levels: 24, 1–4 GCSEs: 17, No GCSEs: 21, Other: 9
Total: 140
As illustrated above the majority of residents within Chattisham have a degree or similar. Apprenticeships have the lowest number of residents, with only one person in the sector. Chattisham is served by Hintlesham and Chattisham Church of England Voluntary Controlled Primary School, a voluntary controlled school located in Hintlesham, England where 85 pupils ranging from 5–11 years of age attend. The school has 24.6 pupils per teacher pupils for each teacher, which is among the lowest of most schools. The students have earned a KS2 average point score of 31.8, putting them on the higher end of all schools."
Church
The All Saints and St Margaret's church located in Chattisham, has a historical essence and has been well respected for many centuries. The church is a grade II listed building and dates back to the 14th century. Throughout the ages the church has been damaged and restored. The top half of the tower was removed for safety reasons, as the structure had become frail. The exterior wall surrounding the west window of the church has been restored with red bricks showing through the previous cement render. It is visible to see each past restoration throughout the structure, as several parts are assembled together. The majority of restoration work took place in the 18th and 19th century, which has remained to this present day. Chattisham's church is a joint parish with Hintlesham church and has been for 350 years. "The churches stand a mile apart from each other, separated by a valley of meadows and woods." Regular fundraising events help with the maintenance and restoration of the church. In addition, this enables it to function properly and have a key role within Chattisham.

Angelo Alessio (born 29 April 1965 in Capaccio) is an Italian football manager and former player.
Playing career
A central midfielder, Alessio started their professional career with then-Serie A club Avellino in 1984. They were then signed by Italian powerhouse Juventus in 1987, with whom they played until 1992 (except for a season loan at Bologna in 1988–89), winning a Coppa Italia–UEFA Cup double in 1990. They then moved to Serie A club Bari, before to join Cosenza in the Serie B and then returning to Avellino (now in Serie C1) in 1997. They ended their career in 1998 after a season with Modena.
Coaching career
After retirement, Alessio joined Napoli as a coaching staff member, first in charge of the youth teams and subsequently as a first team assistant. They then served as head coach for a number of Serie C2 teams (Imolese, Massese, SPAL); however it was not until their combination with Antonio Conte at Siena where their talents were truly noticed.
After achieving promotion out of the Serie B under Conte with Siena, the pair accepted the job at Juventus. At Juventus, Alessio enjoyed three consecutive years of Serie A domination, with three league titles and two Italian Super Cups. After three years at Juventus, in which they once managed as caretaker from October 2012 to December 2012, they again joined Conte at the Italy national football team. After a somewhat successful term and Italy's exit out of the Euros, Alessio parted with Italy and again to followed Conte to Chelsea. In January 2019 they confirmed their intention to start a career of their own as a head coach, thus effectively ending their long-time collaboration with Conte.
On 16 June 2019, Alessio was named manager of Scottish Premiership club Kilmarnock. In their first matches in charge, Kilmarnock lost in Europa League qualification to Welsh Premier League club Connah's Quay Nomads. Alessio was sacked by Kilmarnock in December 2019, with the team sitting in fifth place.
On 10 June 2021, Alessio was named head coach of Liga 1 club Persija Jakarta.
Style of play
A versatile player, Alessio was known for their willingness to play not only anywhere in midfield, but also in almost any position across the entire pitch. Usually deployed as a central midfielder, they were also frequently played as a second striker during their time with Avellino.

The Spring Offensive of the Russian Army was an offensive of the White Army of the White movement led by Alexander Kolchak on the Eastern Front of the Russian Civil War, between March and April 1919.
Background
At the end of 1918, the situation on the Eastern Front of the Russian Civil War was unclear. Both sides fought for the Kama River. The Supreme Command of the Red Army prepared for major offensives on the Southern and Western fronts, hence there were no supplies available for the Eastern front. At the end of December the Whites conquered Perm on the northern flank, but the Reds captured Ufa on the southern flank. On 22 January 1919 the Red 1st Army connected with the Army of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, which had advanced from Middle Asia. On 24 January the Red 4th Army captured Uralsk.
At the beginning of 1919, the Supreme Command of the White Army decided to advance in two directions. The purpose of the northern advance was to connect with the North Russia Front and to strike at Petrograd; the purpose of the southern advance was to crush the Red front on the middle Volga river and to advance to Moscow.
The Whites had three armies:
Orenburg Independent Army (cossacks) (11,000 - 13,000 men, commanded by Alexander Dutov) on the southern flank, from May renamed the Southern Army of 25,000 men under General Petr Belov
Western Army (42,000 - 48,000 men, 120 guns, commanded by Mikhail Hanzhin) in the middle between Birsk and Ufa
Siberian Army (45,000 - 52,000 men, 83 guns, commanded by Radola Gajda) on the northern flank between Glazov and Perm
Another 25,000 Orenburg and Ural Cossack fighters (the Ural Army), south of the Dutov-Belov Army.
The Reds had three armies in the south:
4th Army (commanded by Mikhail Frunze),
Turkestan Army (commanded by Georgy Zinoviev) and
1st Army (commanded by Gaya Gai) in the region to the north of the Caspian Sea (52,000 men, 200 guns and 613 machineguns in common)
and three armies to the north of them :
5th Army ( (10,000 men, 42 guns and 142 machineguns, commanded by Jan Blumberg), defending a 200 km front in the center
2nd army (22,000 men, 70 guns and 475 machineguns, commanded by Vasilii Shorin), near Sarapul
3rd Army (27,000 men, 69 guns and 491 machineguns, commanded by Mikhail Lashevich, since 5 March - Sergei Mezheninov), near Perm railway.
Therefore, on the northern flank both sides were equal, the Whites were stronger in the center (49,000 of Hanzhin's soldiers against the Red 5th Army's 10,000), and the Reds had an advantage on the southern flank (52,000 against 19,000). Both sides decided to strike on the right flank (the Whites on the right flank and in the center) and to cut the communication lines of their opponent's left flank. At the end of February, the Whites pushed back the left flank of the Reds' 2nd Army, forcing it to retreat.
Offensive
On 4 March, the Siberian Army of the Whites began its advance. On 8 March it captured Okhansk and Osa and continued its advance to the Kama river. On 10 April they captured Sarapul and closed in on Glazov. On 15 April soldiers of Siberian Army's right flank made contact with detachments of the Northern Front in a sparsely populated area near the Pechora River.
On 6 March Hanzhin's Western Army stroke between the Red 5th and 2nd Armies. After four days of fighting the Red 5th Army was crushed, its remains retreated onto Simbirsk and Samara. The Reds had no forces to cover Chistopol with its bread storages. It was a strategical breakthrough, the commanders of Red's 5th Army fled from Ufa and the White Western Army captured Ufa without a fight on 16 March. On 6 April they took Sterlitamak, Belebey the next day and Bugulma on 10 April.
In the South, Dutov's Orenburg Cossacks conquered Orsk on 9 April and advanced towards Orenburg.
After receiving information about the defeat of the 5th Army, Mikhail Frunze, who had become commander of the Red Southern Army Group, decided not to advance, but to defend their positions and wait for reinforcements. As a result the Red Army was able to stop the White advance on the southern flank and to prepare its counteroffensive.
Aftermath
The White Army had made a strategical breakthrough in the center, but the Red Army had been able to prepare its counteroffensive on the southern flank.
On April 22, Mikhail Frunze launched their successful Eastern Front counteroffensive against the over-extended Western Army.

The Subic Special Economic and Freeport Zone, often shorterned as Subic Bay or Subic, is a special economic zone and freeport area covering portions of the city of Olongapo and the town of Subic in Zambales, and the towns of Morong and Hermosa in Bataan. The relatively developed and fenced area is called the Subic Bay Freeport Zone (SBFZ).
The economic zone was the location of U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay, until the latter's decommissioning in 1992. The SBFZ is operated and managed by the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA), a sub-agency under the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA). The harbor faces the Zambales Mountains to the west and the Subic Bay opens to the South China Sea.
History
Subic Bay is surrounded by the town of Subic and the city of Olongapo, both in the province of Zambales, and Morong in the province of Bataan. Development of Olongapo was largely tied to the presence of the United States Navy base, once the largest U.S. military naval base in Asia. An arsenal and ship-repair facility was established at Subic Bay in 1885 by the then colonial power, Spain. Following the Spanish–American War, Subic Bay became a U.S. Navy and Marine base, and grew to be a major facility. Until 1991, it was the base of the United States 7th Fleet. In early 1991, after the collapse of protracted negotiations, the Philippine Senate rejected terms for renewal of the lease of the base. The U.S. Navy was already in the process of downsizing its Subic operations in June 1991, when Mount Pinatubo erupted. One of the largest volcanic eruptions in the last 100 years, it covered the Navy Base in volcanic ash and collapsed a significant number of structures. The last ship, USS Belleau Wood, left on November 24, 1992. The presence of the American forces precipitated the start of a red-light district.
Post–Cold War
Subic Bay was converted into a commercial zone largely through the efforts of some 8,000 residents of nearby Olongapo, under the leadership of their mayor, Richard Gordon, who volunteered to protect and preserve 8 billion dollars worth of facilities and property from looting and destruction. Subic has since been transformed and became a model for bases conversion into commercial use after the Cold War with blue chip companies like Coastal Petroleum, and FedEx pumping in over $3 billion of investments creating 70,000 jobs in the free port's first four years. It was hosted to the 4th APEC Leaders' Summit on November 24, 1996 and FedEx's Asia-Pacific hub, Asia-One, was also located in Subic Bay for almost ten years.
In 2013, Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin said that the Philippines intended to move military forces to the base in response to the territorial disputes in the South China Sea. The United States Navy is also seeking access on a rotational basis for ships and Marines, and is already conducting maritime patrol aircraft patrols from bases in the Philippines.
Geography
While the Subic Special Economic and Freeport Zone shares a name with a town nearby, it actually covers portions of Olongapo and the towns of Subic and San Antonio in Zambales and Morong and Hermosa in Bataan. It covers a total area of , but only area is secured and fenced where much of the development in the special economic zone has taken place. This area is referred to as the Subic Bay Freeport Zone and out of this area is suitable for development with the remaining portions consisting of high slopes, forests, or protected areas. In 2017, negotiations with local government units next to the Subic Bay Freeport Zone resulted in expansion of the fenced area.
The special economic zone is also adjacent to a body of water, the Subic Bay. There are also at least six mangrove areas in the Freeport Zone.
Districts
The Subic Freeport Zone itself is divided into districts. The freeport zone also has a Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title (CADT) Land, which is the ancestral domain of the Aeta people.
Binictican Heights
Central Business District (CBD)
Cubi-Triboa

Demographics
Most of Subic Freeport's population of at least 6,000 people is concentrated in the Kalayaan and Binictican areas. Portions of the Subic Freeport area also forms part of an formally-recognized ancestral domain of the Aetas, an indigenous ethnic group living in the area prior to its usage as a US military base. A significant Aeta settlement in Subic is Pastolan.
Economy
In mid-2019, there were about 135,000 workers employed in the Subic Bay Freeport, 68.37 percent of whom are engaged in the service industry and 17.03 percent in the manufacturing industry. Subic was also a hub in shipbuilding, with the now-defunct Hanjin Philippines previously being the single biggest employer in the area prior to its bankruptcy in January 2019. As of mid-2019, there are 5,901 workers or (4.36 percent) employed in the shipbuilding and maritime industry by 96 firms compared to 26,559 workers by 110 companies in 2018. Subic is served by the Port of Subic.
Tourism
In addition to commercial use, Subic Bay is also a popular destination for weekend visitors from Metro Manila. Attractions include several beaches, an underwater aquarium, jungle survival tours, and duty-free shopping centers.
Destinations frequented by tourists in Subic include eco-tourism theme parks, the Ocean Adventure, Zoobic Safari, and the Pamulaklakin Nature Park which is home to the indigenous Aetas who once trained the U.S. Navy in jungle survival tactics.
Subic International Raceway (SIR), the Philippines' first purpose-built motorsports venue, was opened in 1994 and situated near Subic Bay International Airport. It was established by local racing champion, Pocholo Ramirez, and their family. SIR was host to international racing events, such as the Asian Festival of Speed, Asian Formula 2000 and the Asian Formula Three Championship. It also hosted local races, such as the Philippine Touring Car Championship, Run What You Brung (RWYB) and Circuit Showdown. The racetrack ceased operations in 2010 after the end of its lease.
The economic zone is also the host of the Subic Bay Yacht Club, and the bay has been favored as a location for sailing sports especially during the Habagat season. Subic Bay also hosted the sailing events for the 2019 Southeast Asian Games.
Transportation
The Subic Special Economic and Freeport Zone is served by the Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway. Subic is also the site of the Subic Bay International Airport which can be used for chartered flights. The airport was also a former Asian hub of multinational logistics company FedEx. The Port of Subic also serves direct passenger traffic through ferries going to and from Orion, Bataan.
Industrial Park
Most of the businesses inside the Freeport Zone are composed of manufacturing, construction and warehousing. The operations of the freeport zone are subdivided into industrial parks, namely:
Subic Bay Gateway Park (formerly Subic Bay Industrial Park)
Subic Techno Park
Global Industrial Park (SRF Compound)
Boton Lights and Sciences Park

The bill would establish the Law School Clinic Certification Program of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to be available to accredited law schools for the 10-year period after enactment of this Act.
H.R. 5108 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress.
Background
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO or USPTO) is an agency in the U.S. Department of Commerce that issues patents to inventors and businesses for their inventions, and trademark registration for product and intellectual property identification. The USPTO is "unique among federal agencies because it operates solely on fees collected by its users, and not on taxpayer dollars". Its "operating structure is like a business in that it receives requests for services—applications for patents and trademark registrations—and charges fees projected to cover the cost of performing the services [it] provide[s]".
The PTO describes the existing Law School Clinic Certification pilot program as a program that "allows law students enrolled in a participating law school's clinic program to practice Intellectual Property Law before the USPTO under the strict guidance of a Law School Faculty Clinic Supervisor."
Provisions of the bill
This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source.
H.R. 5108 would establish the Law School Clinic Certification Program of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to be available to accredited law schools for the 10-year period after enactment of this Act. The bill would authorize the USPTO Director to establish regulations and procedures for application to and participation in such program.
Congressional Budget Office report
This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on September 10, 2014. This is a public domain source.
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 5108 would have a negligible effect on net discretionary spending over the 2015-2019 period. Enacting H.R. 5108 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.
H.R. 5108 would authorize the Law School Clinic Certification Program at the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) for 10 years after enactment of the bill. In 2008, PTO established the Law School Clinic Certification Pilot Program, which allows students at participating law schools to practice patent or trademark law before the agency under the guidance of a faculty supervisor in the school's law clinic. Currently, 45 schools participate in the program, which costs about $200,000 each year to operate.
Based on information from PTO, CBO expects that any additional actions the agency would take to implement H.R. 5108 would not have a significant effect on the agency's workload, and thus, its spending. In addition, PTO is authorized to collect fees sufficient to offset its operating expenses; therefore, CBO estimates that the net budgetary effect of implementing H.R. 5108 would be negligible, assuming appropriations actions consistent with the agency's authorities.
H.R. 5108 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.
Procedural history
H.R. 5108 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on July 15, 2014, by Rep. Hakeem S. Jeffries (D, NY-8). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. It was reported alongside House Report 113-588 on September 15, 2014. The House voted in Roll Call Vote 497 on September 15, 2014, to pass the bill 327–22.

Patrick Tito Tuipulotu (born 23 January 1993) is a New Zealand rugby union player who is currently a lock for three professional teams, the All Blacks, the Blues in Super Rugby and in the Mitre 10 Cup.
Tuipulotu has played international rugby since 2014, is the Blues' current captain and has previously captained Auckland in 2017 and 2018.
Career
Early career
Tuipulotu was schooled at St Peter's College in Auckland and made their debut for their local side in the 2013 ITM Cup, where they made seven appearances and scored one try. Their impressive displays saw them named in the squad for the 2014 Super Rugby season.
Tuipulotu competed for the New Zealand Under-20s at the 2013 IRB Junior World Championship where they made five appearances and scored one try.
They were named in a preliminary training squad for the All Blacks on 12 May 2014. Tuipulotu was then selected for the All Blacks' squad for the first time on 1 June 2014. They made their All Blacks debut as a substitute in the 28–27 win, against England on 14 June 2014. Tuipulotu did not feature much on debut, replacing the in-form Brodie Retallick with only four minutes left. They then did the same the following week, except New Zealand beat England 36-13, again using Tuipulotu as a substitute.
After being used off the bench twice more during the 2014 Rugby Championship, Tuipulotu earned their first start for the All Blacks against the USA on 1 November 2014. Tuipulotu played the full 80 minutes against the USA, scoring the first try of their international career during the first half of the 71-6 victory. Tuipulotu then rounded their year off with two more appearances off the bench during the end-of-year tour.
2015–2016
Tuipulotu did not play any international rugby in 2015, missing out on the World Cup due to injury. Following their comeback to Super Rugby after recovering, Tuipulotu was selected for the All Blacks' 32-man squad for the 2016 Steinlager series against Wales. Tuipulotu came off the bench in the first two tests of the series and went on to start against Argentina in the second test against them in the Rugby Championship.
Following injury to Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock, as well as the death of Luke Romano's relative, Tuipulotu started in a historic 29-40 first-time loss against Ireland in Chicago, on 5 November 2016, with Blues teammate Jerome Kaino, who was shifted from blindside flanker to lock, following uncapped locks Scott Barrett and Vaea Fifita being called up as injury cover. Tuipulotu played the majority of the test before being replaced by Ardie Savea in the 59th minute. The poor performances of Tuipulotu, Kaino, Joe Moody and Aaron Smith were later criticised, with the unusual locking combination against Ireland generally accepted as the cause of New Zealand's loss. Starting in combination with the now-capped Barrett against Italy the following week, Tuipulotu scored their second test try, producing a much better performance in the 68-10 win.
2017–2018
Tuipulotu did not play against the British & Irish Lions in 2017 after they were late to a Blues training session, following missing much of the season with injury. The 2017 Super Rugby season was a mixed season for Tuipulotu, who scored many tries but struggled to play consistently because of their persistent injury troubles. Following the end of Super Rugby, Tuipulotu was named as captain of Auckland for the 2017 Mitre 10 Cup season, by Auckland coach Paul Feeney.
Following their mixed start to the season, they were not selected for All Blacks 33-man Lions tour squad, losing their spot to Scott Barrett, but was re-called near the end of the 2017 Rugby Championship following the miscarriage of Brodie Retallick's second child. After making four appearances off the bench for the All Blacks during 2017, Tuipulotu regathered form previously lost to injury and made a start against a French XV, in a 28-23 win, scoring a try against them and was chosen to start over Barrett for the final test of the year, against Wales in a 33-18 win. Tuipulotu started in combination with All Black Captain, Sam Whitelock, against Wales and was replaced by Barrett in the 46th minute.
Tuipulotu was very good during the 2018 Super Rugby season but missed many fixtures due to injury. After four months' absence, Tuipulotu returned to rugby, on 7 September 2018, to captain Auckland against Tasman. Tuipulotu scored a hat-trick in the first half of the game, leading their team to a 36-10 win.
Having missed the 2018 June rugby union tests with injury, their outstanding performance against Tasman earned them a re-call to the All Blacks, for the 2018 Rugby Championship, after Brodie Retallick was ruled out for the rest of the competition with a shoulder injury. TJ Faiane took over as Auckland's captain in Tuipulotu's absence. Tuipulotu's return from injury also displaced Luke Romano from the All Blacks, leaving Tuipulotu and Scott Barrett as back-up to Sam Whitelock. Tuipulotu played their first test of 2018 in New Zealand's shock loss to South Africa, on 15 September at Westpac Stadium. Tuipulotu also came off the bench in the next two tests of the competition, which were the last.
With Brodie Retallick back from injury, Tuipulotu only played twice during the 2018 end-of-year tour. They played well in both tests, which were starts in a 69-31 victory over Japan and a 66-3 victory over Italy. Tuipulotu's great form through 2018 then saw them named as co-captain for the Blues' 2019 Super Rugby season, by new head coach, Leon MacDonald. Tuipulotu will be captain alongside loose forward, Blake Gibson, and succeed Augustine Pulu as the team's leader.

Göktürk-2 is an earth observation satellite designed and developed by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) and built by TÜBİTAK Space Technologies Research Institute (TÜBİTAK UZAY) and Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSAŞ) for the Turkish Ministry of National Defence.
Göktürk-2 was launched from Jiuquan Launch Area 4 / SLS-2 in China by a Long March 2D space launch vehicle at 16:12:52 UTC on December 18, 2012, one day before the initial schedule due to poor weather conditions in the region. Equipped with state of the art advanced technology developed by Turkey and a series of new enhancements to provide improved high resolution imagery, it was placed at 16:26 UTC into a low Earth orbit of . The first signal from Göktürk-2 was received at 17:39 UTC in the Tromsø Satellite Station, northern Norway.
Produced with 80 percent indigenously developed technology and 100% domestically developed software, the satellite offers high-resolution imagery of resolution at panchromatic, at multispectral (VNIR) and at SWIR band. It is Turkey's second national satellite following RASAT, which was launched from Russia on August 17 the same year. For the telecommunication, it has three S band receivers and transmitters. Göktürk-2 later put its solar panels into service, and began the week after the launch to send data and its first images, which were from the US, Brazil, India as well as Turkey's western city of Izmir.
Resolution and payload
Professor Dr. Rahmi Güçlü of Yıldız Technical University in Istanbul, an engineer appointed by the Government of Turkey to audit and report on the Göktürk-2 program, has claimed that the imagery obtained from space by Göktürk-2 satellite can be used to identify even individuals, due to the state-of-the-art software filters they have developed and that the Turkish Government has already begun using the technology for obtaining intelligence on the military operations of several countries in the region.
In addition to its primary military reconnaissance mission, Göktürk-2 will carry out various civil applications on mapping and planning, landcover survey, geology, ecosystem monitoring, disaster management, environmental control, coastal zone management, and water resources.
The satellite is part of a family of Göktürk earth observations satellites, which Turkey is developing in order to increase its intelligence resources. As of December 2012, Göktürk-1 is in production and Göktürk-3 in project phase.
Foreign input
SpaceTech GmbH Immenstaad has supplied the solar generator system, which consists of the following:
three solar panels (including photovoltaic assembly),
panel deployment mechanisms,
the pyro drive module (PDM) electronics executing the deployment sequence of the mechanism.
Israeli objections
Israel had repeatedly voiced its objection to the launch of the Göktürk family of satellites by Turkey, stating that it would be used to obtain high resolution imagery of Israel, which could eventually fall into the wrong hands.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan rejected Israeli objections, stating that Turkey is a sovereign nation and as such it would not allow any Israeli interference with Turkey's decision to design, develop, manufacture and launch high resolution intelligence satellites.

In the 2012–13 season they moved up into Freiburg's second team and scored 18 goals in the 2013–14 season, when the team finished as runners-up. In July 2014, Falahen picked up a cruciate ligament injury during a friendly match with the first team and was sidelined for more than half a year. After their return in March 2015, they scored five goals in 11 matches. In the 2015–16 season Falahen received a professional contract with SC Freiburg, and on 5 February 2016, during a 0–2 defeat to VfL Bochum, Falahen made their debut in the 2. Bundesliga as a substitute. This made Falahen the first Palestinian who ever played in the 2. Bundesliga.
Personal life
Born in Germany, Falahen is of Palestinian descent.

Exokernel is an operating system kernel developed by the MIT Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems group, and also a class of similar operating systems.
Operating systems generally present hardware resources to applications through high-level abstractions such as (virtual) file systems. The idea behind exokernels is to force as few abstractions as possible on application developers, enabling them to make as many decisions as possible about hardware abstractions. Exokernels are tiny, since functionality is limited to ensuring protection and multiplexing of resources, which is considerably simpler than conventional microkernels' implementation of message passing and monolithic kernels' implementation of high-level abstractions.
Implemented abstractions are called library operating systems; they may request specific memory addresses, disk blocks, etc. The kernel only ensures that the requested resource is free, and the application is allowed to access it. This low-level hardware access allows the programmer to implement custom abstractions, and omit unnecessary ones, most commonly to improve a program's performance. It also allows programmers to choose what level of abstraction they want, high, or low.
Exokernels can be seen as an application of the end-to-end principle to operating systems, in that they do not force an application program to layer its abstractions on top of other abstractions that were designed with different requirements in mind. For example, in the MIT Exokernel project, the Cheetah web server stores preformatted Internet Protocol packets on the disk, the kernel provides safe access to the disk by preventing unauthorized reading and writing, but how the disk is abstracted is up to the application or the libraries the application uses.
Motivation
Traditionally kernel designers have sought to make individual hardware resources invisible to application programs by requiring the programs to interact with the hardware via some abstraction model. These models include file systems for disk storage, virtual address spaces for memory, schedulers for task management, and sockets for network communication. These abstractions of the hardware make it easier to write programs in general, but limit performance and stifle experimentation in new abstractions. A security-oriented application might need a file system that does not leave old data on the disk, while a reliability-oriented application might need a file system that keeps such data for failure recovery.
One option is to remove the kernel completely and program directly to the hardware, but then the entire machine would be dedicated to the application being written (and, conversely, the entire application codebase would be dedicated to that machine). The exokernel concept is a compromise: let the kernel allocate the basic physical resources of the machine (e.g. disk blocks, memory pages, and processor time) to multiple application programs, and let each program decide what to do with these resources. The program can then link to a support library that implements the abstractions it needs (or it can implement its own).
MIT exokernels
MIT developed two exokernel-based operating systems, using two kernels: Aegis, a proof of concept with limited support for storage, and XOK, which applied the exokernel concept more thoroughly.
An essential idea of the MIT exokernel system is that the operating system should act as an executive for small programs provided by the application software, which are constrained only by the requirement that the exokernel must be able to guarantee that they use the hardware safely.
Design
The MIT exokernel manages hardware resources as follows:
Processor
The kernel represents the processor resources as a timeline from which programs can allocate intervals of time. A program can yield the rest of its time slice to another designated program. The kernel notifies programs of processor events, such as interrupts, hardware exceptions, and the beginning or end of a time slice. If a program takes a long time to handle an event, the kernel will penalize it on subsequent time slice allocations; in extreme cases the kernel can abort the program.
Memory
The kernel allocates physical memory pages to programs and controls the translation lookaside buffer. A program can share a page with another program by sending it a capability to access that page. The kernel ensures that programs access only pages for which they have a capability.
Disk storage
The kernel identifies disk blocks to the application program by their physical block address, allowing the application to optimize data placement. When the program initializes its use of the disk, it provides the kernel with a function that the kernel can use to determine which blocks the program controls. The kernel uses this callback to verify that when it allocates a new block, the program claims only the block that was allocated in addition to those it already controlled.
Networking
The kernel implements a programmable packet filter, which executes programs in a byte code language designed for easy security-checking by the kernel.
Applications
The available library operating systems for Exokernel include the custom ExOS system and an emulator for BSD. In addition to these, the exokernel team created the Cheetah web server, which uses the kernel directly.
History
The exokernel concept has been around since at least 1994, but exokernels are still a research effort and have not been used in any major commercial operating systems.
A concept operating exokernel system is Nemesis, written by University of Cambridge, University of Glasgow, Citrix Systems, and the Swedish Institute of Computer Science. MIT has also built several exokernel-based systems, including ExOS.

Brexit: The Uncivil War (simply Brexit in the US) is a 2019 British television drama film written by James Graham and directed by Toby Haynes. It depicts the lead-up to the 2016 referendum through the activities of the strategists behind the Vote Leave campaign, that prompted the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, known as Brexit. It aired on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom on 7 January, and aired on HBO in the United States on 19 January. Benedict Cumberbatch stars as Dominic Cummings, the Campaign Director of the official designated Brexit-supporting group, Vote Leave.
It received a nomination at the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Television Movie but lost to Black Mirror: Bandersnatch.
Plot
In 2020, at a future (fictional) public inquiry, a frustrated Dominic Cummings attempts to explain that they have no understanding of the way in which technology is reshaping politics and therefore society in the United Kingdom.
In 2015, Cummings rejects an offer by UKIP MP Douglas Carswell and political strategist Matthew Elliott to lead the Vote Leave campaign due to their contempt for "Westminster politics", but accepts when Carswell promises Cummings full control. Cummings decides to use "algorithmic database-driven micro-targeting tools" delivered via social media and the internet instead of a traditional campaign of posters and phone-calls/leaflets delivered by local MPs. Cummings rejects an approach by Nigel Farage and Arron Banks of Leave.EU to merge their campaigns, as their data shows Farage is an obstacle to winning a majority. Cummings' technology-driven approach causes friction with Vote Leave MPs and donors, such as John Mills. Mills, who chairs the Vote Leave campaign, tries to have Cummings fired to merge with Leave.EU, only to be fired himself.
Cummings and their Remain counterpart, Craig Oliver, lay out their strategies and opinion of each other. Both identify the third of UK voters who are still undecided as the key. Oliver identifies "Jobs and the Economy" as their key message, while Cummings believes that the "Loss of Control" and the possible accession of Turkey to the EU is a more common fear concern. Cummings invokes Sun Tzu's The Art of War philosophy to focus on their own message, which they define as: "Take Back Control", thus positioning Vote Leave as the historical status quo and Remain as the "change" option. Cummings meets and hires Canadian Zack Massingham, co-founder of AggregateIQ, who offers to build a database using social media tools of voters who are not on the UK electoral register but are inclined to vote to leave. Meanwhile, Arron Banks meets Robert Mercer, who discusses the potential of social media database tools.
Cummings, using the AggregateIQ database, brings MP Douglas Carswell to Jaywick, a part of their constituency they did not know existed, where a couple articulates the destitution of their position. Oliver, using the traditional focus-groups, realizes that their campaign has failed to understand the concerns of all UK voters as one focus-group descends into a mass quarrel and a member breaks down crying "I'm sick of feeling like nothing like I have nothing! Like I know nothing. Like I am nothing. I'm sick of it"; their own staff becomes demoralized and angry.
In the final stages, high-profile senior Tory MPs Michael Gove and Boris Johnson join the Vote Leave campaign emphasizing the need to "Take Back Control", while Penny Mordaunt raises concerns on BBC over the accession of Turkey. Gove and Johnson have some reticence over specific Vote Leave claims (e.g. £350 million for NHS, and 70 million potential Turkish emigrants) but overcome them. Oliver conducts an emergency Tory-Labour Remain conference call with prime minister David Cameron and Peter Mandelson, but each side blames the other for the Remain campaign's decline. Following the murder of MP Jo Cox, Cummings and Oliver share a drink and discuss events, with Cummings comparing their campaign as having started a train that cannot be stopped, and Oliver replying: "Be careful what you wish for. You won't be able to control it either".
On referendum polling day on 23 June 2016, Britain narrowly votes to leave the EU. After a victory speech, Cummings quietly leaves the Vote Leave campaign office. In the present, Cummings outlines their disappointment at how the political system reacted post the Vote Leave victory, eventually walking out in disgust.
Cast
Production
Screenplay
James Graham, the film's screenwriter, originally wrote a first draft focusing on David Cameron, the UK's prime minister during the vote. However, they then changed it to Dominic Cummings, the campaign director of the official designated Brexit-supporting group, Vote Leave. In a Channel 4 News interview, Graham revealed that the film was based on the books All Out War: The Full Story of How Brexit Sank Britain's Political Class by Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman, and Unleashing Demons: The Inside Story of Brexit by David Cameron's Downing Street communications director Craig Oliver, and on interviews with the campaign strategists involved, Cummings in particular. Oliver acted as a consultant on the film. In order to better play lead character Dominic Cummings, Benedict Cumberbatch visited them at their family home.
Filming
The film was commissioned in May 2018 by Channel 4 with Benedict Cumberbatch cast to play Dominic Cummings. Filming commenced in June with the supporting cast set, including Rory Kinnear and John Heffernan.
Reception
Critical response
Critic reviews were generally positive after the 7 January 2019 broadcast of the film in the UK by Channel 4. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The website's critical consensus reads, "With acerbic wit and a mesmerizingly eccentric performance from Benedict Cumberbatch, Brexit energetically renders recent history with unflinching poise." Metacritic reports a weighted average score of 73 out of 100 based on 12 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Asa Bennet of The Daily Telegraph gave the film five out of five stars, calling it a "thrilling romp through the referendum" and praised Cumberbatch's performance as Cummings, comparing it to their role as Sherlock Holmes in the TV series Sherlock. Will Gompertz of the BBC gave the film four out of five stars and called the film "a very watchable TV movie that has a clear structure and a well-defined plot" and called Cumberbatch's performance "compelling". Carol Midgley of The Times gave the film four out of five stars stating, "Brexit without the boring bits is a blast". The Independent's Hugh Montgomery gave the film four out of five stars and praised Cumberbatch's acting, comparing it to both Sherlock and The Social Network. Peter Crawley in the Irish Times gave the film five out of five stars and called it a "political tragicomedy with the verve of a tech thriller", and that "it drips with great British humour". Suzi Feay in the Financial Times gave the film five out of five stars calling it: "An exhilarating, almost farcical dramatisation of 2016's successful Vote Leave campaign and its Machiavellian director", and "The only hindrance to enjoyment is the fact that we are all now living in the chaotic reality dreamt up by the diamond-eyed ideologue".
Lucy Mangan of The Guardian was very critical of the film, only awarding it two out of five stars, and calling it "superficial, irresponsible TV" and criticised the depiction of Nigel Farage and Arron Banks as "cartoonish buffoons instead of dangerous shit-stirrers".
Other commentators
British playwright and non-fiction author Sarah Helm, praised the film in The Guardian saying: "Nor has any piece of journalism bettered Graham's focus-group scene in portraying how the poison of Brexit has set ordinary people against each other, or exposed how easily our feeble leaders were led by opportunistic apparatchiks". Alice Jones in The New York Times said that "Brexit Is Dividing Britain. So Is a Brexit Movie". Charles Moore wrote in The Daily Telegraph that the film "told a story of forgotten people finding their voice".
People portrayed
On 4 January 2019, Matthew Elliott, played in the film by John Heffernan, wrote an article about the film in the Financial Times summarising that "Whatever happens, the 2016 campaign marked an important moment, and the film captures it well". Dominic Cummings's wife, Mary Wakefield wrote in The Spectator that Cumberbatch's portrayal of their husband even fooled their own son. The Guardian quoted Peter Mandelson (briefly portrayed on a conference call), as saying "The film is extraordinary", and "It presses every button and captures Britain at the time".

State Route 96 (SR-96) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Utah, connecting SR-264 and the town of Scofield to US-6 in a span of . The route is known as the Eccles Canyon Scenic Byway, part of The Energy Loop, a National Scenic Byway.
Route description
The highway begins in the town of Clear Creek, Utah and heads north as a two-lane undivided highway. The route then reaches SR-264 and turns east on the Eccles Canyon Scenic Byway as a continuation of SR-264. Past this intersection, the road turns north-northwest and soon enters Scofield. Past Scofield, the route continues northwesterly to pass the west shore of the Scofield Reservoir. On the northwestern side of the Reservoir, SR-96 passes on the Scofield Dam and then heads north, north-northwest, and due east to terminate at US-6, south of Soldier Summit and northeast of Helper.
History
The highway was relocated during the construction of the Scofield Dam in 1943 by the W.W. Clyde Company of Springville, Utah. During 1945, SR-96 was completed crossing the old spillway and connecting it with the dam. From the south end of the dam, it connected to the old route, continuing into Scofield.

Flabellum angulare is a species of deep sea coral belonging to the family Flabellidae. It is found in the northern Atlantic Ocean at depths of between .
Description
Flabellum angulare is a solitary coral and does not form colonies. The type specimen was dredged from the seabed at by the Challenger expedition off Nova Scotia, and described in 1876 by the British zoologist Henry Nottidge Moseley. It is a small species a few centimetres in diameter, with a regular pentagonal shape, and a regular arrangement of the septa (stony ridges), with ten septa in the first and second cycles, ten in the third and twenty in the fourth. The corallite is vase-shaped and has a short pedestal. The living coral is pearly white with a glistening surface.
Biology
Flabellum angulare is an azooxanthellate species of coral; this means that its tissues do not contain photosynthetic algae and it gains its nutrition solely from what it can catch with its tentacles from the surrounding water. Despite living at bathyal depths to which no light penetrates, Flabellum angulare is one of a number of deep sea invertebrates that show synchronisation of their life cycles to the phases of the moon.

The Plym Valley Railway is a heritage railway based on part of the now-closed South Devon and Tavistock Railway, a branch line of the Great Western Railway in Devon, England.
History
The line was originally part of the South Devon and Tavistock Railway, a broad gauge railway linking Plymouth with Tavistock in Devon, England. This opened in 1859, was converted to in 1892 and closed in 1962.
Local enthusiasts set up a group in 1982 to restore part of the line as the Plym Valley Railway. The first section re-opened in May 2008 when trains could operate over of track as far as Lee Moor crossing, the site where the gauge Lee Moor Tramway (now the West Devon Way cycle path) used to cross the line on the level. A new station was constructed just north of the site of the original Marsh Mills railway station as that site is occupied by a line that serves the Marsh Mills china clay plant. The new station was provided with a shop, buffet and small museum.
The preserved line was extended to on 30 December 2012, bringing it to in length.

Salomon de Bray (1597 – 11 May 1664) was a Dutch Golden Age painter and architect.
Biography
De Bray was born in Amsterdam, but established themselves in Haarlem before 1617, where they are registered as being a member of the schutterij that year in the St. Adrian's cloveniers. They probably followed draftsmanship and painting lessons in the small academy started by Karel van Mander, Hendrick Goltzius and Cornelis van Haarlem, and where they married in 1625.  They are registered as a pupil of Goltzius and Cornelis van Haarlem, but they probably started their training in Amsterdam with Jan Pynas, Nicolaes Moeyaert and Pieter Lastman. They painted history paintings, portraits and landscapes. As a Catholic they probably also made altar pieces for the Haarlem underground Catholic churches known as mission stations, or staties. They were a poet and member of the Chamber of rhetoric called "De Wijngaertranken". One of their poems was set to music by their friend the composer Cornelis Padbrué. This is probably how they met their wife Anna, the sister of the painter Jan and the poet Jacob Westerbaen, who were also members of De Wijngaertrancken. They married in 1625.
Failed charter of the Guild of St. Luke
In 1630 they became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke. They cooperated with fellow guild member and Catholic architect-artist Jacob van Campen in the decoration of Huis ten Bosch in The Hague. Their works draw on the spirit of the Dutch classicism beginning at that time, and are comparable with those of their Catholic colleague Pieter de Grebber. De Bray became active as an architect and designer of silverwork, and became headman of the Guild of St. Luke. They prepared a new charter for the guild (that was never ratified) in 1631, that was signed by Pieter de Molijn, Outgert Ariss Akersloot, Willem Claesz Heda, Cornelis Cornelisz, Cornelis Claesz van Wieringen, Floris van Dyck, and Isaak Halinck, respected members of the guild. This charter met with a lot of opposition from the Haarlem council, and was probably rejected for its efforts to promote painting above other guild pursuits such as engraving, woodcarving, tapestry-making, smithwork and pottery. In 1632 they made efforts to retrieve the St. Lucas guild relic that had been stored in the guild altar of the St. Bavochurch. It had been given to a representative of the Catholic church for safekeeping and De Bray felt it should be brought back to Haarlem, but the relic was never found.
Work as an architect
As an architect, they were involved in the construction or expansion of Haarlem's City Hall in 1630, the new consistory of the Bavokerk, the Zijlpoort, and St. Annakerk (Church of St. Anne). Outside of Haarlem, they designed a new entrance in 1629 for the Huis te Warmond (since rebuilt) that featured pilasters and a broad pediment. In Nijmegen they made a design for the city orphanage. They were also a town planner for the city council of Haarlem. They designed an ambitious plan to expand the city on the North side with three canals (the "Brouwers gracht", the "Staten gracht", and the "Linde gracht") that was partially implemented in the decades after their death with the Nieuwe Gracht and what is today the Parklaan. In 1631 Salomon de Bray wrote "Architectura Moderna" which provided a biography and descriptions of buildings built by Hendrick de Keyser and Cornelis Danckerts de Ry, two of the key
Dutch architects of the period.
Family of painters
Salomon de Bray was the father of ten children, of whom three (Dirck de Bray, Jan de Bray, and Joseph de Bray) became notable artists. They probably died of the plague that hit Haarlem in 1664, as they and their children Jacob, Josef, Juliana and Margaretha all died in April and May of that year. Their wife had already died the previous year. They were buried in the Sint-Bavokerk in Haarlem.

Rules
Pieces
Pawns move as pieces in checkers: they move, without taking, one square diagonally forward, but take by jumping two squares diagonally forward over an enemy piece to an empty square, thereby removing the enemy piece. Capturing of one or more pieces is mandatory.
Kings moves as a promoted checkers piece: this is the same type of move as a pawn in this game, but now the king can move and take also diagonally backwards. Capturing of one or more pieces is mandatory.
The bishop moves and takes exactly as in normal chess. Capturing is not mandatory.
The camel (Golomb called it the cook) has a kind of extended knight's move: it goes one diagonal and two straight. With this move, they can jump over other pieces, (like a knight jumps), but the camel takes by moving to the square on which the enemy piece is located. Capturing is not mandatory.
Promotion
When a pawn reaches the last row of the board its move is ended, and the pawn can promote to king, bishop or camel.
Starting position
White: Kings c1, e1; Bishop a1; Camel g1; pawns a3, b2, c3, d2, e3, f2, g3, h2.
Black: Kings d8, f8, Bishop h8; Camel b8; pawns a7, b6, c7, d6, e7, f6, g7, h6.
Black moves first.
Victory conditions
The player that captures all opponent's kings wins the game. Also, a player that is stalemated (cannot move) loses the game.

Drosera filiformis, commonly known as the thread-leaved sundew, is a small, insectivorous, rosette-forming species of perennial herb. A species of sundew, it is unusual within its genus in that the long, erect, filiform (thread-like) leaves of this plant unroll in spirals – an arrangement similar to the circinate vernation seen in ferns.
Distribution and habitat
D. filiformis occurs naturally in both Canada and the United States; its natural range extends down the eastern seaboard of North America from south western Nova Scotia in the north down through New England to Florida in the south.
Cultivation
D. filiformis is frequently cultivated, with a few registered cultivars, such as D. filiformis var. filiformis (also known as D. filiformis typical), D. filiformis × 'California Sunset' (a hybrid between D. filiformis var. filiformis. All of these cultivars are grown with similar conditions as most other Drosera species: mineral-poor soil and distilled, reverse osmosis, or collected rain water. D. filiformis require a winter dormancy for long-term survival, forming hibernacula in the winter.

Abraham Niclas (Clewberg) Edelcrantz (28 July 1754 – 15 March 1821) was a Finnish born Swedish poet and inventor. They were a member of the Swedish Academy, chair 2, from 1786 to 1821.
Edelcrantz was the librarian at The Royal Academy of Turku. In 1783 they moved to Stockholm to lead the Royal Theater and later work as the private secretary of the king Gustaf III.  They are known for their experiment with the optical telegraph. They inaugurated their telegraph with a poem dedicated to the Swedish King on their birthday in 1794. The message went from the Palace in Stockholm to the King at Drottningholm.
They eventually developed their own system which was quite different from its French counterpart and almost twice as fast. Their system was based on ten collapsible iron shutters. The several positions of the shutters formed combinations of numbers which were translated into letters, words or phrases via codebooks. The telegraph network was made up of telegraph stations positioned at about 10 kilometres from one another.
In 1796 they wrote A Treatise on Telegraphs.
In 1797, they were elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Alexander Gustav Adolf Graf von Schleinitz (born 29 December 1807 in Blankenburg am Harz; died 19 February 1885 in Berlin) was the Foreign Minister of Prussia from 1858 to 1861 and minister for the royal household from late 1861 to their death.
Life
Early years
They came from an old aristocratic family from the Margraviate of Meissen that was elevated to the rank of Reichsfreiherr already in the 16th century; their father was the Regierungspräsident of Blankenburg, and later minister of state in the Duchy of Brunswick, Karl Ferdinand Freiherr von Schleinitz (1756-1837); their mother was Barbara von Hochstetter (1768-1819). They were the brother of the minister of state of Brunswick, Wilhelm von Schleinitz (1794-1856), and of the Prussian Regierungspräsident Julius von Schleinitz (1806-1865).
Schleinitz studied in Göttingen and Berlin, and joined the Prussian civil service in 1828. In 1835 they became an embassy attaché, in 1841 they were made an Expert Councillor (Vortragender Rat) in the foreign ministry. In July 1848 they replaced Heinrich Alexander von Arnim as Foreign Minister, thus joining the government of Gottfried Ludolf Camphausen. However, after a few days they resigned from their post, and subsequently represented Prussia at the court of Hannover.
Political career
In May 1849 they negotiated the peace treaty with Denmark, and in July 1849 once again took up the position of Foreign Minister in the government of Friedrich Wilhelm, Count Brandenburg. However, since their German patriotic views were not compatible with the way Prussian politics was developing, they retired from public service on 26 September 1850 as a Wirklicher Geheimer Rat, and from then lived near Koblenz in close contact with the court of the Prince of Prussia, and at Schloss Gebesee in Thuringia.
After the Prince-Regent, the later King and Emperor Wilhelm I, assumed control of the government, Schleinitz, who was one of the King's closest confidants, once again took over the Foreign Ministry, in the Prince-Regent's government of the "New Era" that was called together in November 1858. The main tenets of their foreign policy were the attempt to form an alliance with England and Austria, the maintenance of the balance of power in Europe and a strengthening of Prussia's role in Germany. The domestic problems of the liberal government moved them to leave the government in October 1861 and take over the Ministry of the Royal Household, where they remained to their death in 1885. From then onwards they were the arch-enemy of Otto von Bismarck, who became Prime Minister of Prussia in 1862. Prussian Liberals, as well as Bismarck themselves at times saw the Household Ministry as a "Counter-Government" of Queen Augusta, to the King's conservative government.
On the occasion of the Emperor's and Empress' golden wedding anniversary, Schleinitz and their wife were elevated to the rank of Graf (Count) on 11 June 1879.
Marriage
From 1865, Alexander von Schleinitz was married to Marie von Buch (1842-1912), who was 35 years younger than they are. As Gräfin Schleinitz they became the most important salonière of the time in Berlin. Along with "Mimi", as they were known, they championed Richard Wagner and the Bayreuth Festival.
They had no children. Their joint grave, which has not been preserved, is in the Trinity Church Cemetery No. 1 in Berlin.

Reception
Dimitris Passas of Tap the Line observed Bullets strives, "to show how difficult is to judge its characters who are repeatedly making questionable, in terms of ethics and morality, decisions because of extreme circumstances." SBS-TV's Anthony Morris described the pivotal interaction between lead characters, Mari (Kosonen) and Madina (Kekilli), and explained, "[it's] about the connection between the two women as it is about the plot twists and turns you'd expect from a spy drama." TV Tonights David Knox felt, "[this is] an intelligent mix of crime serial, espionage thriller, and political drama, set against the atmospheric backdrops."

The Miami County Courthouse, located east of the junction of Miami and Silver Streets in Paola, is the seat of government of Miami County, Kansas. The courthouse was built from 1898 to 1899 and has housed the county's government ever since. Architect George P. Washburn designed the courthouse; its design is Victorian with Romanesque Revival details. The building features a tower at each corner; the southwest tower was once a clock tower but no longer has a clock. The east and west entrances to the courthouse feature porches with brick columns. The upper windows of the building are arched with stone; the stone continues around the building in a band, a feature described as "one of the strongest elements of the [building's] design". The courthouse's roof incorporates a variety of designs; the main part of the roof and the towers are hipped, while gable ends are located between the towers.
The courthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 1, 1973.

There are several systems for romanization of the Telugu script.
Systems
Vowels
Consonants
Irregular Consonants
Other diacritics
Virama (్) mutes the vowel of a consonant, so that only the consonant is pronounced. Example: క + ్ → క్ or + → .
Anusvara (ం) nasalize the vowels or syllables to which they are attached. Example: క + ం → కం or + →
Candrabindu (ఁ) also nasalize the vowels or syllables to which they are attached. Example: క + ఁ → కఁ or + → .
Visarga (ః) adds a voiceless breath after the vowel or syllable it is attached to. Example: క + ః → కః or + →
UN romanization for geographical names
The United Nations romanization systems for geographical names (approved 1972, I1/11; amended in 1977 IH/12) was based on a report prepared by D. N. Sharma.
The UN romanization uses macrons for long vowels ā ī ū, a dot under ṛ for vocalic r, and caron on ĕ and ŏ.
ka kā ki kī ku kū kṛ kĕ ke kai kŏ ko kau
ISO
There are differences between the UN system and the ISO transliteration standard ISO 15919: 2001
ITRANS
ITRANS also has transliteration for Telugu.
RTS
Used in Vemuri Rao's English-Telugu Dictionary (2002) Rice University's Reverse Transliteration System (RTS) (created by Ramarao Kanneganti and Ananda Kishore) can be used for the transliteration of Telugu into Roman script as an alternative to phonetic alphabet. The RTS is defined below. (1) Represent short vowels by the lower case ..."
RTS represents short vowels by the lower case English character and long vowels by the corresponding upper case character: అ = a, ఆ = A; etc.
Unaspirated consonant-vowel pairs are represented by a lower case letter followed by a suitable vowel.
The result is a phonetic representation mostly suitable for dictionaries and computer input methods. Examples:

The 82nd Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade (; Military Unit Number 03214) was a surface-to-air missile brigade of the Soviet Air Defense Forces and briefly the Russian Air Defense Forces.
Active from 1960, the brigade provided air defense for the Leningrad area with S-75 Dvina and S-125 missiles. It reequipped with S-300PS missiles in the late 1980s, and merged with a unit withdrawn from Latvia to become the 500th Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment in 1993 and 1994.
History
The brigade was originally formed as the 82nd Air Defense Brigade of Special Designation, a unit of System-100, the Leningrad air defense missile system, in 1958. It was the fourth brigade of the system to be formed and was based at Gostilitsy, near Lomonosov. The brigade became operational with nine battalions of S-75 Dvina missiles, and was redesignated the 82nd Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade in August 1960. One of its battalions was stationed in Kronstadt near the Bychye Pole airfield. In 1963, the first S-125 battalion of the brigade became operational in Kronstadt, based near the city cemetery. The brigade eventually included seven S-125 battalions. In 1967, the brigade was directly subordinated to the 6th Independent Air Defense Army when the air defense missile system was abolished as an independent headquarters.
In 1986, the 86th became part of the 54th Air Defense Corps. It included fourteen S-75 and S-125 battalions by 1988, when it began replacing its S-75s and S-125s with the new S-300PS in two groups of battalions. Between 1993 and 1994, the 82nd was merged with the 158th Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade, withdrawn from Latvia, to become the 500th Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment.

Zhuozi (, died 651 BC) or Prince Zhuo () was for a month in 651 BC the ruler of the State of Jin during the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China. Their ancestral name was Ji (姬) and given name was Zhuo (卓). They were the son of Duke Xian of Jin, and their mother Shao Ji was the younger sister of Duke Xian's favored concubine Li Ji.
When Duke Xian died in the ninth month of 651 BC, Crown Prince Xiqi, the son of Li Ji, ascended the throne. However, only a month later Xiqi was killed by the minister Li Ke (里克). Chancellor Xun Xi (荀息) then installed Zhuozi, Xiqi's younger half-brother and cousin, on the throne. But Zhuozi met the same fate as Xiqi: a month later they were also killed by Li Ke, and Xun Xi committed suicide. After Zhuozi's death Li Ke installed their older half-brother Prince Yiwu on the throne, known as Duke Hui of Jin. Duke Hui would later force Li Ke to commit suicide for the crime of killing Xiqi and Zhuozi.

Esterline Technologies Corporation was a publicly traded company that designs, manufactures, and markets specialty products primarily for aerospace and defense customers. The company is best known as a supplier of products and equipment for aerospace companies such as Boeing and Airbus; and for American and allied military forces.
Esterline is based in Bellevue, Washington. Curtis Reusser serves as company chairperson, president, and CEO.
On March 14, 2019, TransDigm successfully completed the acquisition of Esterline Technologies Corporation (formerly NYSE:ESL).
History
Early history
Esterline was founded in 1906 by John Esterline, an electrical engineer and former head of the electrical engineering department at Purdue University. Esterline originally made magnets and recording devices. The company was renamed the Esterline-Angus Company when Esterline began working with Donald J. Angus.
Esterline-Angus merged with Boyar-Schultz, Inc., a manufacturer of surface grinding materials, in 1967. The newly merged company was renamed Esterline Corporation. Esterline went public in 1968. Later that year, the company entered the aerospace and defense sectors with its acquisition of Babcock Electronics.
The company began acquiring medical supply and equipment companies in 1969. By the early 1970s, the company held businesses specializing in ophthalmic goods and hearing aids. The company had sold the majority of its healthcare businesses and subsidiaries by 1978 when Esterline sold its hearing aid manufacturing business. After exiting the healthcare sector, Esterline had acquired 20 additional companies by 1986.
Aerospace and defense
In 1987, after releasing poor financial reports, the Esterline board dismissed the company's entire executive team including then-chief executive officer Thomas Howes. Later that year, Esterline appointed seven new senior officers, all of whom were affiliated with Criton Technologies, an aerospace manufacturer. Criton Technologies was wholly owned by Dyson-Kissner-Moran (DKM), a New York City-based investment firm that had also been Esterline's largest shareholder since the firm bought Esterline in 1967 and took it public in 1968. Carroll Martenson, Criton's chairperson, was appointed chairperson and CEO of Esterline. Esterline also relocated from Darien, Connecticut to Bellevue, Washington in order to share its headquarters with Criton Technologies. The company had been located in Darien, Connecticut since 1975.
The new management team reorganized the company and sold underperforming businesses and subsidiaries. In 1989, Esterline purchased DKM's remaining 23% share in the company and Criton Technologies' aerospace and defense businesses for a collective $147.5 million. The company was then renamed Esterline Technologies.
By the early 1990s Esterline operated in ten separate industries and the company refocused itself on the defense and aerospace sectors. Esterline also changed chief executives in 1992, with company president and COO Wendell Hurlbut succeeding the retiring Carroll Martenson. Robert Cremin succeeded Hurlbut in January 1999. Cremin had served in executive positions for the company for 22 years, and had most recently served as company president and COO.
From 1997 to 2003, Esterline acquired 22 companies while selling businesses that did not fit the company's new focus. Esterline's acquisitions included Fluid Regulators Corporation, a manufacturer of hydrologic controls for the commercial aviation and defense industries; Kai R. Kuhl Company, a manufacturer of seals for the aerospace industry; Kirkhill Rubber, a manufacturer of custom molded engineered elastomers for the aerospace industry; and Advanced Input Devices, a manufacturer of custom keyboards and multifunction data-input subsystems. The company also expanded its European business with acquisitions of Muirhead Vactric and Norcroft Dynamics, two United Kingdom-based manufacturers of aerospace parts.
Esterline continued its acquisition push into the defense and aerospace industries throughout the 2000s. In 2002, the company acquired the BAE Systems' North American electronic warfare countermeasures business. The deal consisted of two facilities, which manufactured anti-radar chaff and aircraft-dispensable flares designed to thwart infrared homing missiles. The company purchased Leach International in 2004 for $145 million. Esterline had been attempting to acquire Leach since 1994 and the deal was Esterline's largest acquisition at the time. Leach was a manufacturer of controls and analytical instruments for aerospace and medical diagnostics.
Esterline acquired Darchem Holdings, a British manufacturer of thermally engineered aerospace and defense products including ducting systems and heat shields, in 2005. That year, 80% of Esterline's revenue came from the company's aerospace and defense business, up from 17% in 1995. In 2006, Esterline purchased Wallop Defence, a British manufacturer of electronic warfare countermeasures, including flares. The company then acquired CMC Electronics, a Canadian aerospace and defense avionics manufacturer in 2007 for $335 million (USD).
In 2009, Esterline acquired Racal Acoustics, a British manufacturer of combat communications equipment ranging from noise-canceling communication headsets to secure telephone networks for use in active battlefields. R. Bradley "Brad" Lawrence succeeded Robert Cremin as Esterline CEO in November of that year. Lawrence had worked at Esterline since 2002, most recently serving as company president and COO since June 2009. Cremin stepped aside to take on the Chairmanship of Dover Corporation.
Esterline continued its expansion into the military communications and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) markets with its purchase of Eclipse Electronic Systems, a manufacturer of signal and communication intelligence hardware for aerospace applications in 2011. Later that year, Esterline acquired the Souriau Group, a French aerospace and defense connector company, for $715 million.
In September 2013, Esterline appointed Curtis Reusser to succeed Brad Lawrence as the company's CEO. Reusser had formerly served as president of United Technologies Corporation's aircraft systems business. Esterline then acquired Joslyn Sunbank Company, an aerospace connector accessory supplier, a few months later in December 2013. In February 2015, Esterline acquired the defense and aerospace division of the Belgium-based display manufacturer, Barco. In February 2017, the company announced a new advanced displays engineering and manufacturing facility in Kortrjik, Belgium called the "Spidle" site.
Esterline is the producer of the well known Korry switches and control devices used in most airliners and flight simulators on the market, including Airbus, Boeing and others.
Corporate structure
Esterline manufactures products for the aerospace, defense and general industry sectors. The company is organized into three segments: Avionics & Controls; Sensors & Systems; and Advanced Materials.
The Avionics & Controls segment manufactures avionics equipment and communication systems for both commercial and military applications. The Sensors & Systems segment manufactures connectors, sensors and power management systems, which are primarily used in the aerospace industry. The Advanced Materials segment manufactures elastomer products and thermal components for commercial and military applications; and military ordnance and electronic warfare countermeasures.

Mass media in Nigeria has an interesting and long history.
Media culture
Historically, Nigeria has boasted the most free and outspoken press of any African country, but also one which has consistently been the target of harassment by the past military dictatorships. Many agents of Nigeria's press have been imprisoned, exiled, tortured, or murdered as a result, among them being Ogoni activist and television producer Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was executed for treason by order of the Sani Abacha dictatorship in 1995 (resulting in the expulsion of Nigeria from the Commonwealth of Nations and sanctions from abroad).
Even under the somewhat less-oppressive current civilian government, journalists have continued to come under fire, be it from the government (as with the June 2006 arrest of Gbenga Aruleba and Rotimi Durojaiye of African Independent Television under charges of sedition) or from other popular establishments (such as the self-imposed exile of Thisday's Isioma Daniel following the riots in Northern Nigeria over "sensitive comments" which they had made in an article regarding Muhammad and the 2002 Miss World pageant.
A fatwa calling for their beheading was issued by the mullahs of northern Nigeria, but was declared null and void by the relevant religious authorities in Saudi Arabia, and the Obasanjo faced an international public relation smearing (especially within journalistic circles) in the aftermath, which was not helped by the Amina Lawal controversy which had occurred prior to the riots, which had seen over 200 dead). However, as with most other countries, blogging has increasingly become a much safer, and much easier, conduit for Nigeria's growing Internet-enabled minority to express their dissatisfactions with the current state of affairs in Nigeria.
Media corruption
Brown envelope journalism in Nigeria is a practice whereby monetary inducement is given to journalists to make them write a positive story or kill a negative story. The name is derived from cash inducements hidden in brown envelopes and given to journalists during press briefings. It is a common practice in Nigeria and many journalists do know that it is unethical. One of the effects is that the Nigerian media has become a hotbed for sponsored stories.
Mediums
Newspapers
Until the 1990s most publications were government-owned, but private papers such as the Nigerian Tribune, The Punch, Vanguard, and the Guardian continued to expose public and private scandals.
Laws related to the media, including newspapers, are scattered across various pieces of legislature.
There are few good sources of discussion and analysis of these laws.
An analysis of newspapers shows a strong bias towards coverage of males, reflecting prevalent cultural biases. Few articles discuss women and there are few photographs of women outside the fashion sections.
Although earnings have declined since the late 1980s the number of publications has steadily grown.
As of 2008 there were over 100 national, regional or local newspapers.
Radio and television
While newspapers (and, most recently, blogging) have long thrived in Nigeria, radio and television has not received as much recognition, due to limited resources and press restrictions which beset the establishment of radio or television services in Nigeria. However, such limitations have since been improved in order to reach larger audiences both within and without Nigeria, such as with the growth of satellite television. The BBC World Service as well as the Voice of America and the German broadcasting organization Deutsche Welle (DW) also provide shortwave radio in the Hausa language.
Most viewed channels
Internet sites
Virtually all Nigerian newspapers have an internet presence; in addition, there are several websites which are dedicated to allowing Nigerians to air their opinions on a variety of topics.

Titus Annianus was a poet of ancient Rome, who lived in the time of the emperors Trajan and Hadrian, and wrote erotic or light verse (ludicra carmina), possibly in the Faliscan language.
Annianus was a friend of Aulus Gellius, who says of Titus that they were tremendously knowledgeable about ancient literature and the rules of language. They claimed to Aulus Gellius to have been a pupil of Marcus Valerius Probus. Among other things, they appear to have written (somewhat ribald) Fescennine Verses. Based on the information that Gellius provides, modern scholars consider this Annianus to be the author of a number of verses that the grammarian Terentianus ascribes to an anonymous Faliscan poet.
Aelius Festus Aphthonius (via the grammarian Gaius Marius Victorinus, whose work Aphthonius's was often appended to) mentions Annianus as the author of a Faliscum carmen. (Whether Terentianus and Aphthonius meant the poet wrote in the Faliscan language, or was an ethnic Falisci, or both, is uncertain.)
The few verses of Annianus' that survive seem to be dedicated to pastoral country life and viniculture, and it is supposed that these are overall reflective of their body of work, owing to the fact that in their short description, Aulus Gellius depicts Annianus as harvesting grapes.
Annianus is likely identical with the "Annianus Faliscus" mentioned by Ausonius as writing Fescennine Verses in Hadrian's time.

Mech-kladenets (. ) is a fabulous magic sword in Russian fairy tales and byliny, rendered "sword of steel", "hidden sword", or "magic sword" in English translations.
The "self-swinging sword" or mech-samosek (also mech-samosyok, . ) is also regarded as equivalent by certain commentators, though others consider them to be distinct.
Etymology
Max Vasmer's dictionary defines kladenets as a modifier designating a "magic sword in Russian tales", and the sword kladenets has been translated "magic sword" in texts.
The word "kladenets" can putatively be linked to the Slavic word klad () "treasure, hoard," although "a number of philologists doubt" that this word-stem figures in the derivation of "[this] Russian epithet of this sword".
Some sources point out that kladenets sword, being a treasure, is frequently connected with the motif of being hidden inside a wall, under a rock, or under a sacred tree, waiting to be discovered by the bogatyr hero, and George Vernadsky goes as far as to translate the kladenets weapon as "the hidden sword". Although Vernadsky fails to elaborate, an alternative etymology connects the term kladenets to klast' () "to lay or put", and their interpretation lies in this camp.
One rational explanation derives the word from uklad[ny] () "steel" and kladenets is defined as meaning "made of steel" in the Dictionary of the Russian Language published by the Russian Academy of Sciences (and later in the Dictionary of archaic and obsolete words, published by Nauka). Hence some sources render "sword of steel".
Another explanation, credited to Alexander Veselovsky (1888), theorizes that kladenets may be a corrupted pronunciation of Kgl'arentsya or Kgl'adentsya ( or ), the sword of . The Russo-Ukrainian tale of Bova was adapted from the medieval Italian romance of Buovo d'Antona, in which the original sword name is or . This etymology has been endorsed by Max Vasmer's dictionary, under the entry that defines kladenets as a "magic sword in Russian tales", or "magic sword".
The corrupted form mech-kolunets () is also attested.
Attestations
In some versions of the wonder-tale (skazka) concerning the bogatyr "Yeruslan Lazarevich", mech-kladenets is mentioned alongside the Fiery Shield and Flame Spear (; ).
The sword is mentioned in passing in the tale Storm-Bogatyr, Ivan the Cow's Son (Afanasyev No. 136) but plays no significant role in the tale.
Samosek
While Vernadsky mentions "the self-swung sword" (mech-samosek) alongside mech-kladenets as commonplace elements in Russian folktales, they present the swords as distinct from one another, since the kladenets sword needs to be wielded by a bogatyr.
Other sources however, present these two swords (mech-kladenets and mech-samosek) as equivalent, for example, a mythology dictionary with Yeleazar M. Meletinsky as supervising editor. The reasoning is not well-clarified, but this dictionary explains its view that kladenets (treasure) is often connected with the motif of being hidden inside a wall, and in the tale example it gives, the "Tale of the City of Babylon" (Skazanie o Vaviloné grade ), the samosek-sword is also called "Asp The Serpent" (), and it was ordered hidden inside the wall by the sword's owner, Nebuchadnezzar.
Elsewhere, the self-swinging sword under command of St. George beheads a Tatar tsar.

Reception
The Indian Express wrote, "As both lovers belong to the upper class, the décor of the interiors is modish. G.OR. Nathan's photography accentuates this effect: the soft and diffuse lighting gives the film a classy texture". Kalki gave the film a more mixed review.

The vice-chancellor of Austria is a member of the Government of Austria and is the deputy to the Chancellor. It is functionally equivalent to a deputy prime minister in other countries with parliamentary systems.
Description of the office
Art. 69(2) of the Constitution of Austria states:
The Vice-Chancellor stands in for the Federal Chancellor in their complete field of functions. If both Federal Chancellor and Vice Chancellor are hindered, the Federal President appoints a member of the government to represent the Federal Chancellor.
In practice, the Vice-Chancellor is normally the leading member of the junior party within the current coalition government, frequently the party chairperson. If only one party is represented in the government, the Vice Chancellor is often the Chancellor's presumed successor.

On November 4, 2014, Hadley defeated Democratic assembly member Al Muratsuchi by a margin of just 706 votes. In 2016, Hadley was defeated in their own bid for reelection in a rematch with Muratsuchi. Prior to serving in the California State Assembly, Hadley was the Republican party chairperson for the 66th assembly district and an entrepreneur and investment banker.
Early life and education
Hadley was born and raised in Fullerton, California and graduated from Servite High School in Anaheim. They received their bachelor's degrees in both Economics and History from Dartmouth College (1986), and they completed their Master of Science in Economic History at the London School of Economics (1994).
Business career
From 1986 to 1999, Hadley was an employee of BT Alex Brown and its predecessors and affiliates, including BT Securities Corporation and Bankers Trust Company. During their employment they worked in New York and Atlanta, and moved with the firm to Los Angeles in 1996. When Hadley resigned in June 1999 upon the acquisition of BT Alex Brown by Deutsche Bank, they were a managing director in the media & communications investment banking group.
In June 1999, Hadley founded Hadley Partners, Incorporated.
Political background and experience
Hadley previously served as the chairperson of the Beach Cities Republicans.

In September 2016, Hadley announced they would not vote or support the Republican nominee for the presidency, Donald Trump. They said "I am not voting for either Secretary Clinton or Mr. Trump. Both have shown themselves unfit for the highest office in the land. Neither reflects the South Bay values that this citizen legislator is trying to bring to Sacramento."
In July 2017, Hadley declared their candidacy for Governor of California in 2018; they withdrew from the race two weeks later.

The Biotron is a research facility located at the University of Wisconsin-Madison that "provides controlled environments and climate-controlled greenhouses to support plant, animal, and materials research for university, non-profit, and commercial clients."
History
An evolution of the phytotron, the development of the facility had its roots in the late 1950s as a campaign established by the Botanical Society of America in search of a national phytotron. With additional funding and support by the National Science Foundation the Biotron was eventually envisioned as a combination facility that would allow both plant and animal tests to be conducted.
Plant physiologist Folke Skoog would be instrumental in bringing the Biotron to the University of Wisconsin-Madison. A colleague of Frits Went at Caltech, Skoog oversaw the two proposals the university submitted to the Botanical Society in 1959. The interdisciplinary nature and scope of the project quickly led it to becoming Madison's most expensive facility at around $4.2 million. It was up to Harold Senn, appointed director of the Biotron to concentrate on assembling funding, which they were able to accomplish by January 1963, with the Ford Foundation and National Institute of Health contributing to the project.
The Biotron was officially dedicated on September 18, 1970 with many experiments under precise controlled environmental conditions already under study, such as a lizard in the Palm Springs desert or black-eyed peas growing in hot and humid Nigeria. When finally completed in 1971, the Biotron contained over fifty rooms with many ables to variate temperature from as low as -25C to as high as 50C with humidity adjustable anywhere from 1%-100%. Data from the various tests and sensors would then be fed and logged into a PDP-8/E-AA computer. Senn supposedly spent an additional $3,000 of the Biotron budget on increasing the computer's memory an extra 4 kilobytes.
In 1977, the International Crane Foundation brought endangered Siberian crane eggs from the U.S.S.R. to the Biotron for incubation and initial feeding. A hyperbaric chamber was added and used for experiments on the effects of diving on pregnancy. A hypobaric chamber was used for high altitude tests of devices administering doses of vaccines and drugs.
Although the Biotron went through a period of decline in the 1980s, unlike other facilities it never closed. In 1986, the first experiments using LEDs to grow plants were developed with NASA and tests were performed for the Galileo probe before its 1989 launch. Much of its work in the 1990s partnered with NASA in the Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) and its goal in researching the viability of certain vegetables for space travel, in particular the potato. Study of animal hibernation were done by ESA for human space exploration.
Rooms
The Biotron has 45 rooms that are capable of simulating a range of environmental variables with precision and control. These rooms feature separate air handling and control over the temperature, humidity, and lighting. Some rooms specialize in isolation from sound and vibration, electromagnetic radiation, or pressure.

CCGS J.E. Bernier was a Canadian Coast Guard medium Arctic icebreaker with a steel hull. The vessel was in service from 1967 to 2006. The ship was initially based at Quebec City but finished their career at St. John's. The ship was named for Joseph-Elzéar Bernier, captain of which explored and monitored the eastern Arctic for the Government of Canada in the early 20th century. The vessel was sold in 2006 to private interests.
Design and description
J.E. Bernier was long overall with a beam of and a draught of . The ship had a fully loaded displacement of , a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 2,457.25 and a net register tonnage (NRT) of 704.63. The ship was propelled by two screws each with a fixed-pitch propellers powered by a diesel-electric system (AC/AC) composed of four Fairbanks-Morse 8-cylinder diesel engines and four generators driving two motors that created . This gave the ship a maximum speed of but the vessel made during sea trials. The ship carried of diesel fuel and had a range of at . The vessel could operate one Bell 206L helicopter from a flight deck placed over the stern of the ship.
Service history
The icebreaker was constructed by Davie Shipbuilding at their yard in Lauzon, Quebec with the yard number 659. J.E. Bernier was launched on 28 April 1967 and commissioned in August 1967. The ship was registered in Ottawa, Ontario and was initially based at Quebec City, Quebec.
In 1972, the ship was among the three icebreaking escorts for a convoy of seven cargo ships travelling to Mokka Fjord and Eureka. This was the largest convoy to sail that far north. In 1974, J.E. Bernier, with a Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Sûreté du Québec detachment on board, was sent to eject occupiers of a vessel that had gone aground on Île d'Orléans in the Saint Lawrence River. As the icebreaker came alongside the grounded ship, the illegal occupiers escaped over the stern and fled. In 1976, J.E. Bernier transited the Panama Canal to replace on the West Coast of Canada after Camsell was damaged. The icebreaker spent the summer working in the western Arctic and Beaufort Sea, during which the ship supported the research vessel before severe conditions north of Alaska forced Parizeau to turn back. The icebreaker returned to Quebec City via the Northwest Passage, circumnavigating North America. In 1980, the icebreaker returned to the West Coast to replace Camsell again and to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the transfer of the Arctic archipelago to Canada from the United Kingdom. The ceremony was hosted by the Governor General of Canada Edward Schreyer aboard the icebreaker. The ship once again circumnavigated North America on their return to Quebec.
In June 1994, during the height of the Turbot War, a disagreement between Canada and the European Union (EU) over fishing rights on the Grand Banks, J.E. Bernier was used to ferry personnel and equipment from St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador to Coast Guard vessels monitoring EU fishing fleets. In 1995, J.E. Berniers home port was transferred to St. John's. The vessel was taken out of service in 2005 and transferred to Crown Assets Distribution and renamed 05 in May. The ship was sold in June 2006 to Midnight Marine Ltd of Newfoundland.

Mime Misu (b. 21 January 1888 - 1953) (born Mișu Rosescu) was a Romanian ballet dancer, pantomime artist, film actor and director. In 1912 they wrote and directed the first feature film about the sinking of the , In Nacht und Eis, released in August 1912 four months after the disaster.
Early acting life
Mime Misu was born in the market town of Botoșani, Romania, into a family of artistes. They were the nephew of the 'world famous' Rahel. They were on the stage from an early age in ballet and pantomime, and they displayed enough talent to be given a free place at Bucharest Art Academy. During their studies they were assigned to the Royal National Theatre, and after graduating with honors they successfully played in provincial theatres in Romania. In 1900 they performed at the 1900 World Fair in Paris, and then took their own productions to Berlin, Vienna, Budapest and London.
Film director
Misu worked for the film production companies Lux and Pathé Frères in Paris before signing up with Continental-Kunstfilm of Berlin in 1912 where they wrote and directed three films: Das Gespenst von Clyde, In Nacht und Eis, and Das Mirakel. Misu made one more film in Germany, Der Excentric-Club for Projektions-AG Union (PAGU).
An article in the Berlin journal Licht-Bild-Bühne in 1914 called them the 'Napoleon of film' (de:'Napoleon der Filmkunst'), referring to their various technological advances. When Emil Schunemann (the cameraman for In Nacht und Eis and Das Mirakel) called them a barber in their memoirs, they aren't being particularly complimentary.
Misu went to the USA but only made one known film with their Misu-Film Co., The Money God.<ref>1914 dreht Mime Misu bei Metropolitan Film Co., in den USA, seinen letzten uns heute bekannten Film The Money God". Als Linzenzdatum wird hier der 10.2.1914 mit der Nummer 2118 angegeben. See Filmblatt 9, in German (find full ref!!)</ref> In 1915 they directed Ontmaskerd ('Unmasked') in the Netherlands under their real name, Misu Rosescu. Like In Nacht und Eis, this film also contains a scene of a ship sinking.Ontmaskerd (Unmasked), AKA De Wereld (The World). Production: Filmfabriek-Hollandia, Producer: Maurits H. Binger.
Misu travelled to the US every year from 1915-1917. Their Berlin address in 1915 was Nachodstraße 25, Berlin-Wilmersdorf. In 1920/21 Misugraph-Film G.m.b.H., had its offices at Martin-Luther-Straße 28, Berlin, according to the Reichs-Kino-Adressbuch.
In 1921 Misu seems to have misrepresented themselves as to their level of involvement at Famous Players Lasky, and to have caused some considerable offence. This led to an exchange of letters in the Berlin film journal Film-Kurier.
Information about their later career and death is uncertain.
Selected filmography
They directed at least six films:
Das Gespenst von Clyde (1912)In Nacht und Eis (1912) (and also possibly played the part of the radio operator)
Das Mirakel (1912), later Das Marienwunder: eine alte Legende Der Excentric-Club (1913/14)
The Money God (1914)

Beatlemania Hamburg was a museum in Hamburg, Germany devoted to the Beatles.
The museum opened in May 2009 conceived as a "Beatles experience". It was located in the St. Pauli district, near the Beatles-Platz and the Große Freiheit, location of the clubs in which the Beatles played during their formative Hamburg period in the early 1960s.
A large model of a Yellow Submarine hung above the entrance. The museum itself spanned five floors and contained 11 rooms, each with a different theme. The history of The Beatles from their Hamburg period to their break-up was displayed through a mixture of original exhibits, interactive features and fan memorabilia, as well as a reconstruction of the Große Freiheit street in the 1960s style.
Closing
The museum closed the doors on 30 June 2012 "due to lack of interest".

Neodymium magnets
In August 2015, Nitto Denko announced their development of a new method of sintering neodymium magnet material. The method exploits an "organic/inorganic hybrid technology" to form a clay-like mixture that can be fashioned into various shapes for sintering. Most importantly, it is said to be possible to control a non-uniform orientation of the magnetic field in the sintered material to locally concentrate the field to, e.g., improve the performance of electric motors. Mass production is planned for 2017.

Victoria "Vicki" Huntington is a Canadian politician who served in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 2009 until 2017 as an independent for Delta South.
Education and early career
Huntington is a native of Vancouver, British Columbia, and has a degree in political science from the University of British Columbia. Much of their early career was spent in the RCMP Security Service and subsequently working with ministers of the crown in Ottawa, Ontario. More recently, they served five terms as an elected Councillor in the municipality of Delta, British Columbia.
Huntington worked with the RCMP Security Service for most of the 1970s. Prior to joining the force they were commissioned a first lieutenant in the Canadian Army Intelligence Corps (Res).
Following their years with the Security Service, Huntington served as band manager for the Gitanmaax Indian Reserve in Hazelton. They later worked as a policy assistant to the federal Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, as a member of the Nisga'a Task Group, and as vice chair of the Lower Mainland Treaty Advisory Committee (LMTAC) and its representative on the Provincial Treaty Negotiating Team.
During their years in Ottawa, Huntington also served as executive assistant and acting chief of staff to the Solicitor General of Canada and to the Minister of National Revenue. They were also involved in various capacities with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. They returned to British Columbia in 1988 as the director of the Federal Ministers' Regional Offices at Canada Place in Vancouver.
Huntington received an award from the Delta Farmland and Wildlife Trust for exceptional service.
Political career
A resident of Ladner (Delta), British Columbia, Huntington was first elected in 1993 to Delta Municipal Council and returned to council at or near the top of the polls in the four subsequent municipal elections. They declined to run again in 2008.
Huntington ran in the 2009 general election. They finished a close second in initial results on election night, with opponent Wally Oppal leading by a margin of just two votes over Huntington. This result was subject to an automatic judicial recount because the margin of victory was fewer than one-500th of all votes cast. On May 26, 2009, the recount revealed that Huntington had defeated Oppal by 32 votes, to become the first independent MLA elected to the B.C. provincial legislature since the general election of 1949.
Huntington was elected to a second term in the 2013 election with an increased plurality. They were the first independent MLA in the province's history to be re-elected to a second term.
Huntington had stated in May 2016, that they were "not ready to retire", but later changed their mind in January 2017 citing health concerns and decided not to seek a third term.
Post-Political career
Huntington endorsed Green Party candidate Peter van der Velden for Delta South in the 2020 election.
Electoral record
Family
Huntington's father Ron Huntington was elected to the House of Commons of Canada three times as a Progressive Conservative, in 1974, 1979, and 1980, representing the electoral district of Capilano on metro Vancouver's north shore.

Antonín Lhota (2 January 1812, Kutná Hora – 10 September 1905, Volyně) was a Czech painter and art teacher.
Life and work
They studied at the Prague Academy of Fine Arts under and František Tkadlík. After further studies in Munich and Vienna, they returned to the Academy in 1844, where they were employed for ten years, proofreading lectures and serving as an assistant teacher. This was followed by a multi-year study trip to Italy and Paris which included participation in the Exposition Universelle (1855). In 1867, they became a Professor at the Academy in Prague and was promoted to Director upon the death of Jan Swerts (1879).
They specialized in history painting, secular and religious, primarily on Czech subjects. They were active as a painter well into their seventies, when they painted murals at the Home for the Blind in Mala Strana. They retired at the age of seventy-five and went to live with their son, Emil, who ran an industrial school in Volhynia. Their other son, Augustin, was a drawing teacher in Rakovník.
Apart from their own works, they taught an entire generation of Czech painters, including Václav Brožík, František Ženíšek, Mikoláš Aleš, Jakub Schikaneder, Maximilian Pirner, Josef Václav Myslbek and others. From 1872, they also served as an examiner for teacher candidates in the Czech and Moravian elementary schools.
At the time of their ninetieth birthday in 1902, they were the oldest living Czech painter. By then, their painting style was considered somewhat obsolete as it focused on composition and detail, but neglected the psychological element. Their most lasting contribution may be the joy for painting they instilled in the artists of the next generation.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte made a speech at the Naval Station Felix Apolinario in Camp Panacan, Davao City on August 7, 2016. In the speech, delivered shortly after midnight during their wake visit to four NavForEastMin soldiers killed during clashes with the New People's Army in Compostela Valley, Duterte revealed the names of 150 public officials, including mayors and other local government executives, legislators, police, military and judges, found to be involved in illegal drug trade. They described the drugs situation in the country as "pandemic" after 600,000 drug dealers and dependents have surrendered to the police in just one month since they took office.
Background
Rodrigo Duterte ran their presidential campaign on a ruthless anti-crime and anti-drugs platform. Following their landslide victory in the May 2016 elections, the Philippine Drug War was launched to fulfill their campaign promise of wiping out criminality in the country within six months.
The speech was not the first time that Duterte named and shamed government officials with links to illegal drugs. In their speech before military personnel at the 69th anniversary of the Philippine Air Force in Clark Air Base on July 5, 2016, they read out the names of five Philippine National Police (PNP) generals who they said "contributed to the deterioration of law and order in this country." They were retired Deputy Director General Marcelo Garbo Jr., National Capital Region Police Director Chief Superintendent Joel Pagdilao, Quezon City Police Chief Superintendent Edgardo Tinio, Western Visayas Police Chief Superintendent Bernardo Diaz, and retired Chief Superintendent and now Daanbantayan Mayor Vicente Loot. Saying they were "compelled by sense of duty" to inform the public, Duterte also ordered the five generals relieved from service and to report to PNP Director General Ronald dela Rosa within 24 hours to undergo investigation.
Ten days later, on July 15, 2016, Duterte revealed that a list of politicians with links to the narcotics trade was presented to them by intelligence agencies and that they would announce their names once the information was validated.
On August 1, 2016, Duterte through a statement read by Malacañang Palace spokesperson Ernesto Abella identified the first "narco-politician" as Albuera Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr. whom they ordered to surrender to PNP General dela Rosa within 24 hours together with their drug lord son after the mayor's staff were arrested during a buy-and-bust operation where police seized P1.9 million worth of methamphetamine. Four days later, three local government officials, Maguing Mayor Mamaulan Abinal Molok, Ampatuan Mayor Rasul Sangki, and former Marantao Mayor Mohammad Ali Abinal, voluntarily surrendered to the PNP ahead of the announcement of Duterte's "narco list".
Speech
In the early hours of August 7, 2016, during their visit to the wake of four soldiers killed by the New People's Army (NPA) at the NavForEastMin headquarters in Davao, Duterte criticized the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), whom their administration was pursuing peace talks with, for using land mines. They began their speech by citing the Geneva Conventions.
Even as the government and the CPP-NPA have earlier stated their commitment to seek an end to the communist rebellion in the Philippines, Duterte had also earlier expressed their disappointment at CPP founder Jose Maria Sison for failing to reciprocate their government's ceasefire declaration made during their First State of the Nation Address. Duterte warned the CPP that if they fail to include the prohibition of land mines in the scheduled peace talks in Oslo, their government would pull out from the talks and continue the war for another 45 years.
Right after their short address to the CPP, Duterte proceeded to their report on the "narco list" which they promised earlier to reveal and which they claimed to have come from military and police intelligence. Duterte said:
Noting that they are only performing their sworn duty as president to inform the public on matters of their own security and doing it as part of their campaign to cleanse and purge the government of illegal drugs and corruption, Duterte then presented the enormity of the drugs problem in the Philippines. They stated that there were 3 million drug dealers and users in the country in 2014 based on a report from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. They added that this number has gone up in the last two years and that 92% of all villages in Metro Manila are now contaminated with drugs.
Before announcing the names of narco officials on the list, Duterte narrated how some of those officials they would be naming had been their friends and some even supported them in the presidential campaign. However, they also said that they would rather resign as president than be tied to them. Duterte blamed the government officials for what they called a drug pandemic by saying:
Duterte then began reading the names of the 150 public officials while also describing the specific cases or involvement in the illegal drug trade of some of those politicians.
After expressing their thoughts on earlier criticisms from non-governmental organizations against the campaign, Duterte then began revealing the names of 95 law enforcement and army officers, both active and retired. They reiterated that performing police officers who killed in the performance of their duty will get their protection and pardon, while those that have "allowed themselves to be used" will not get any deliverance from him. They further warned:
By the time they had reached over a hundred drug personality names, Duterte paused for breath, and with a sad tone, they continued:
Duterte announced that those they named are relieved of their assignments and that their firearms licenses and permits had also been revoked. They also instructed the police to report to their mother units in PNP and the army to the AFP Chief of Staff within 24 hours for their investigation.
The local government officials named were ordered to report to the Department of the Interior and Local Government, the members of congress to their Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the judges to the Supreme Court, all within 24 hours. They were also told that their firearms licenses and permits had been cancelled and that the local government officials were being stripped of their supervision powers over local police.
Towards the end of the speech, Duterte reiterated that they were taking full responsibility for the listing and the revalidation of the list submitted by their intelligence officers.
Reaction
Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno wrote a letter to Duterte with regards to the judges they named as part of the list of officials alleged to be involved in the illegal drug trade. They expressed their concern on the safety and performance of duty of those judges and called the announcement by Duterte as "premature". In the letter, Sereno also informed the President that Judge Natividad of the Regional Trial Court of Calbayog has been dead since 2008, that Judge Mupas of Dasmariñas had already been dismissed for gross misconduct since 2007, and that Judge Gonzales of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Iloilo City already retired in June 2016.
They cautioned those four other judges against surrendering to the police without a warrant of arrest. After a verbal tussle with the President on the legality of their order to the judges and the threat of a martial law arising from a potential constitutional crisis, Sereno eventually agreed to investigate their judges and ordered the PNP and PDEA to submit their formal complaints.
Senator Leila de Lima expressed concerns over the inaccuracies on the President's narco list after a few of those identified have been found to be already dead, or had a different position. They also said there were some names there, "maybe a handful, whom I find hard to believe to be involved in drugs."
Former President and Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada expressed their support for the name and shame campaign of President Duterte. They said that if Duterte does not go after and shame these elected officials, "pretty soon we will have top government officials, even senators, who are in cahoots with drug syndicates."
Archbishop Emeritus Oscar Cruz also voiced their support for Duterte's campaign and said they were "slowly being impressed by their leadership because they mean business." While maintaining that they still have doubts with the drug-related killings, they also said they are confident that the President "will fix it" and that Duterte is serious about eliminating the drug menace when they said they were "not afraid to die and is even willing to put their friends in jail."
Public reaction
Public reaction to the speech has been very enthusiastic and largely "supportive," particularly online. On Facebook, where the "narco list" has been published by several national news outlets, many of the Philippines' 47 million Facebook users have expressed their support for Duterte's hard line on drugs and their desire to see justice handed out to institutional backers of the drug trade. The news link from Inquirer.net alone received 40,800 shares on the day it was published.

Gerald Gunther (May 26, 1927 – July 30, 2002) was a German born American constitutional law scholar and a Professor of Law at Stanford Law School from 1962 until their death in 2002. Gunther was among the twenty most widely cited legal scholars of the 20th century, and their 1972 Harvard Law Review article, "The Supreme Court, 1971 Term Foreword: In Search of Evolving Doctrine on a Changing Court: A Model for a Newer Equal Protection," is the fourth most-cited law review article of all time. Gunther's pathbreaking casebook, Constitutional Law, originally published in 1965 and now in its 17th edition (co-edited with Kathleen Sullivan), is the most widely used constitutional law textbook in American law schools.
Early life and education
Gerald Gunther was born on May 26, 1927, in Usingen im Taunus, Germany, where their family had worked as butchers for over three centuries. Gunther entered primary school during the same year in which Adolf Hitler gained power. In school, Gunther experienced virulent anti-Semitism; a Nazi schoolteacher labeled Gunther "Jew-pig" and segregated them from their classmates. Though initially hesitant to leave Germany, Gunther's family fled for the United States in 1938, only a few hours after witnessing the destruction of their town synagogue. Upon arriving in America, Gunther's family settled in Brooklyn, New York.
Gunther attended Brooklyn College, where they graduated with an A.B. in 1949. They then received an M.A. in public law and government from Columbia University in 1950 and an LL.B., magna cum laude, from Harvard Law School in 1953, where they were an editor of the Harvard Law Review.
Career
From 1953 to 1954, following their graduation from Harvard, Gunther clerked for Judge Learned Hand of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and from 1954 to 1955, for Chief Justice Earl Warren of the United States Supreme Court. As later revealed by Warren, Gunther played a central role in the writing of the Court's landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (II).
After a year in private practice at a Wall Street law firm, Gunther joined the faculty of Columbia Law School in 1956. At Columbia, Gunther mentored future Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who graduated from Columbia Law School in 1959. According to Ginsburg, Gunther helped to secure their clerkship with Judge Edmund L. Palmieri of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York "by pressuring every judge in the Southern District" to hire them Gunther also advised Ginsburg on how to broaden constitutional protections to women when they were a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, and in July 1993, Gunther testified for Ginsburg at their Senate confirmation hearings.
In 1962, Gunther left Columbia for Stanford Law School, where they became the William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Law in 1972, taking emeritus status in 1995 (though they continued to teach until their death). At Stanford, Gunther, who was motivated by their childhood experiences in Nazi Germany, became an outspoken defender of civil liberties, particularly the right to freedom of speech. In 1976, Gunther famously defended the freedom of speech rights of American Nazis, and in 1988, Gunther opposed a Stanford University ban on expressions of racial or religious intolerance. Recalling their own experiences with anti-Semitism, Gunther spoke of "the need to walk the sometimes difficult path of denouncing the bigot's hateful ideas with all my power, yet at the same time challenging any community's attempt to suppress hateful ideas by force of law."
In addition to their prolific scholarship on constitutional law, first amendment law, and the U.S. Supreme Court, Gunther spent 22 years researching and writing their influential 818-page biography of Judge Learned Hand, titled Learned Hand: The Man and the Judge. Gunther's biography earned them numerous awards, including the Triennial Book Award of the Order of the Coif and the Erwin N. Griswold Triennial Prize from the Supreme Court Historical Society.
Gunther was ultimately awarded five honorary degrees, as well as the Learned Hand Medal for Excellence in Federal Jurisprudence from the Federal Bar Council in 1988, the Richard J. Maloney Prize for Distinguished Contributions to Legal Education from the Order of the Coif in 1990, and the Bernard E. Witkin Medal from the State Bar of California in 1995. In 1987, in a survey of lawyers conducted by the National Law Journal, Gunther was voted as the most qualified candidate for the United States Supreme Court. They were a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.
Gunther is played by Ronald Guttman in the film On the Basis of Sex (2018). The scene has Gunther playing a Tenth Circuit judge in a moot court to prepare Ruth Bader Ginsburg for an oral argument in Moritz v. Commissioner.

Sue Barton is the central character in a series of seven novels for adolescent girls written by Helen Dore Boylston between 1936 and 1952. The series was published by Little, Brown & Co. and saw a number of reprints following its initial publication. At present, the series is in reprint by Image Cascade Publishing.
The series follows Sue Barton through their nurse's training and their work life. In Sue Barton: Student Nurse, Sue begins training as a student nurse. They meet their friends Kit and Connie in this book and also their husband-to-be, Dr. Bill Barry. Sue manages to have a number of adventures as they train, including falling down a laundry shaft and saving a feverish patient from jumping out of a window while recovering from appendix surgery. In Sue Barton: Senior Nurse, Sue finishes their training, which includes psychiatric nursing and obstetrics. They also become engaged to Bill at the end of this book. In a publisher's note in a 1967 British edition of the book, Boylston stated that all the nursing incidents in the first two books were based on real events. The Kit, Connie and Bill characters were also based on real individuals and used their real names, while others used pseudonyms. They denied that Barton themselves was an autobiographical portrait, saying "I made them up, lock, stock and barrel.  They are the kind of person and the kind of nurse I wished I were, and I had a lot of fun creating her."
Sue Barton: Visiting Nurse follows Sue and their friend Kit as they venture to New York City to join the Henry Street Settlement Nurses, created by Lillian Wald. Connie gets married in this book and Bill pressures Sue to marry him. Sue refuses, wanting a chance to repay the training they received from the Settlement Houses. At one point, Sue helps an elderly patient fulfill their dream of travel by using the money for their wedding clothes.
Sue Barton: Rural Nurse follows Sue as they ultimately leaf the Visiting Nurses and returns home, only to find that a tragic accident has left Bill with the care of a disabled brother. They cannot marry Sue until things are settled. Sue sets themselves up as a visiting rural nurse in the town of Springfield, New Hampshire and winds up in the middle of a typhoid outbreak. Sue finally marries Bill at the start of Sue Barton: Superintendent Nurse and then works as the head of the nursing school at the new hospital in Springfield. However, their marriage to Bill is not smooth sailing and Sue questions their ability to provide a proper nursing training for their students. In Sue Barton: Neighborhood Nurse Sue suffers regrets about leaving their nursing career while they care for their three children, each of whom has particular needs. They also help a young teenager, Cal, to be more sociable and Cal's mother, the artist Mona Stuart, to be kinder. Sue realizes that their role in their family and the wider neighborhood is also important. In Sue Barton: Staff Nurse (the final installment in the series), Sue returns to work to support their four children while their husband is in a sanatorium suffering from tuberculosis. They eventually recover and the family is reunited once more, with the implication that Sue will return to their position as wife and mother.

Sorry Baby () is a 1999 Chinese comedy film directed by Feng Xiaogang, presented by Forbidden City Film, starring Jacklyn Wu, Ge You and Fu Biao. It is another Feng Xiaogang hesui pian ("New Year Celebratory film") screened during Chinese New Year to boost box office takings.
The film tells of the attempts made by a Beijing van driver (Ge You) to obtain their wage arrears from travel agency boss (Fu Biao) - even to the point of kidnapping the latter's Singaporean girlfriend (Jacklyn Wu).
The Chinese title can be translated as “never-ending (persistency)”.
Plot
Freelance Beijing van driver Han Dong (Ge You) has worked for travel agency boss Ruan Dawei (Fu Biao) for over a year. Ruan is always thinking new schemes to make money and keeps delaying Han's wages. When the arrears reach 98,000 yuan and Ruan refuses to pay, Han kidnaps Ruan's Singaporean girlfriend Xiaoyun (Jacklyn Wu), who is hospitalized in Beijing due to tuberculosis. Ruan is certain Han, a simple, meek fellow, does not have the courage to harm their girlfriend and dares them to kill them over the phone, rejecting a ransom.
Xiaoyun realizes Ruan is putting their lives at stake and plots revenge with Han, who has no real intention of harming her, to extort payment from their boyfriend. As time goes by, Han's caring nature is revealed and Xiaoyun discovers they need the money to support a comatose, hospitalized elder sister.
After the police intervenes, Ruan pays up. Han is cleared of all charges since Xiaoyun does not admit to their abduction. Xiaoyun returns to Singapore but reappears miraculously during the 2000 New Year to visit Han, hinting of a future romance between the two.

Bangor Bridge (also known as the Bangor-on-Dee Bridge) is a Grade I listed bridge crossing the River Dee in Bangor-on-Dee, Wrexham County Borough, Wales. It is situated on the community boundary between Bangor-is-y-Coed and Sesswick. Located to the west of Bangor-on-Dee, it connects the village's high street and the A525 road bypass. The narrow bridge is a one-way traffic bridge, west to east, and is downstream (north) of the Bangor by-pass bridge.
Description
The bridge crosses the River Dee, which currently serves as the boundary between the communities of Bangor-is-y-Coed and Sesswick within Wrexham County Borough since 1996. The River Dee at this location, historically served as the boundary between the historic county of Denbighshire to the west and Flintshire's Maelor Saesneg containing Bangor-on-Dee to the east.
The bridge is listed by Cadw, and described to have a group value with the nearby listed buildings of Bangor-on-Dee war memorial and the Church of St Dunawd.
The cambered bridge's five unequal elliptical stepped arches are mainly made of red sandstone, with some coursed rubble and finely dressed stone. The parapets and full height splayed cutwaters are made of yellow sandstone with refuges on the top. The parapets are also made of large dressed slabs and are apart.
Inigo Jones is speculated to be the bridge's architect, with similar bridges constructed in places such as Llanrwst (Pont Fawr) and Llangollen attributed to him.
A scheduled monument is also on the site, consisting of a medieval or post-medieval remains of an older bridge.
History
The earliest reports of a bridge at or near this location in historical maps date to 1036, whereas the earliest mention of a medieval wooden design bridge at this location was recorded in 1292.
The current bridge is of medieval late 15th or early 16th century origins but the current structure mainly dates to the 17th century, with a notable restoration in 1658, by Inigo Jones.
The bridge was repaired several times over its lifespan, including a repair () in 1757 caused by frequent flooding. There was another repair costing () in 1843.
It was recorded by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales in 1910. The bridge connects to the village's high street.
Prior to the 1900's the bridge was mainly used by horse-drawn vehicles, farm carts and pedestrians. When motor vehicle usage on the bridge increased, it damaged the bridge, leading to the introduction of traffic lights and weight restrictions on the bridge to limit the damage. In 1970, there was a petition to construct a new bridge and by-pass in the village, with the bridge and by-pass completed in 1978 and is located south (upstream) of the medieval bridge. The Bangor-on-Dee bridge was reduced to only one-way traffic from the west, when the A525 by-pass opened.

Kadhilil Sodhappuvadhu Yeppadi () is a 2012 Indian romantic comedy film written and directed Balaji Mohan based on the sametitled short film they made. It was simultaneously shot in Tamil and Telugu languages, the latter titled Love Failure. The film stars Siddharth and Amala Paul. It was released worldwide on 17 February 2012 to critical acclaim and was declared a hit.
Plot
Arun (Siddharth) and Parvathi (Amala Paul) give an interview about their love story, but they fight even before the interview gets over. The movie then rewinds five months earlier. Arun meets Parvathi in a college canteen, and they soon become friends. Parvathi has problems at their home, as their mother Saroja (Surekha Vani) wants to divorce their father Akilan (Suresh). Arun and Parvathi fight for trivial reasons and then get together. The movie revolves around how little things may contribute to breakups.
One day, while Parvathi gets stressed up and wants to talk to Arun, they did not answer their phone. They fight on that issue, and gradually, their fight frequency grows. Arun introduces them to their parents, and Arun's father recognizes them as one of their client's daughter. They tell their son that Parvathi's parents are getting divorced. As time progresses, they break up, but the reason is not revealed. Arun's friend Vignesh tries to propose to their junior Rashmi (Dhanya Balakrishna), but they address them as brother and then introduces their lover, who is Vignesh's senior. Arun tries to recover from the breakup. Arun's friend calls them to a trip to Pondicherry to see their friend John (Shyam). John's girlfriend Cathy (Pooja Ramachandran) starts a friendly chat with Arun. Cathy wishes to help Arun and asks them why they broke up. Arun says that they do not have any reason, and that is their problem. Since Cathy becomes friendly with Arun, a misunderstanding crops up between Cathy and John. Meanwhile, Akilan approaches Prabhu (Ravi Raghavendra) for a divorce from Saroja. Prabhu, who is Arun's father, advises Akilan to reunite with Saroja after knowing that Akilan is Parvathi's father. Akilan and Saroja unite in Parvathi's grandparents' 80th marriage. Consequently, John realises that Arun and Cathy are just being friendly, and they reunite with Cathy. Also, while Rashmi realizes that their lover (Vignesh's senior) is a playboy, they realizes this, tells this to Vignesh, and accepts their true love. At last, Parvathi and Arun reunite after a silly quarrel in the same canteen that they met earlier.

Production
Development
Siddharth had said that they watched the ten-minute Tamil short film Kadhalil Sodhappuvadhu Yeppadi by Balaji Mohan and found it interesting, developing an interest to turn it into a mainstream full-length feature film. Incidentally Balaji Mohan was holding talks with Sashikanth Shivaji of YNot Studios then and was planning to approach Siddharth to play the male lead role; Siddharth joined the crew and also decided to co-produce the venture with cinematographer Nirav Shah on their newly launched banner Etaki Entertainment. Owing Siddharth's popularity in Telugu cinema, the film was made as a bilingual, shot simultaneously in Tamil and Telugu as was their previous venture 180. Filming took place in Hyderabad for an urban, modernistic backdrop. Siddharth later confirmed that filming of the film's both versions were completed in a record 35 days. Television actor Deepa Venkat dubbed for the speaking voice of Amala Paul.
Marketing
A first teaser trailer was uploaded by Siddharth on YouTube in December 2011. The filmmaker had started promotions in a unique way to impress the youths. Structured like a comic-book, the print ad introduced to a short conversion between the couple – Siddharth and Amala Paul – and their exchange of thoughts can be seen in the speech balloons. BlueSky purchased the complete overseas theatrical and DVD/VCD rights of romantic comedy entertainer of Siddharth's own production Love Failure. Siddharth also confirmed that the producers had broken even on the project before the theatrical release of the film, presumably by rights sale to TV channels and other means. This marketing and producing strategy was commended by many critics on producing small-budget movies with mainstream stars setting a new trend in the Telugu film industry.
Soundtrack
The soundtrack was composed by S. Thaman. While Madhan Karky penned the lyrics for three songs, director Balaji Mohan themselves wrote the lyrics of the song "Ananda Jaladosam"; Sri Mani wrote all lyrics in the Telugu version.
Release
Kadhalil Sodhappuvadhu Yeppadi and Love Failure released on 17 February 2012. Dil Raju had acquired the Telugu distribution rights of the film. The film opened at No.1 in Chennai box office accounting for 40% of the takings. Gradually, shows were increased and it accounted for 49% of the takings in its second weekend. The satellite rights of the film's Tamil version were acquired by STAR Vijay.
Critical reception
The film received positive reviews in both languages. Sify.com's reviewer said that the film was an "enjoyable romantic ride" that worked "largely due to its fresh script which dwells on the magic of love and its illusions", going on to label it as "jolly good fun". The Times of India critic N. Venkateswaran gave it 4 out of 5 and commented that Balaji Mohan had made an "impressive debut with their tale of love and forgiveness", while pointing out that the screenplay was "cleverly written" and the dialogues were written in an "easy, conversational tone and are sure to strike a chord with youngsters". Karthik Subramanian from The Hindu wrote: "KSY [...] is not just an experience. It is a festival. Make sure to take your entire gang along". Behindwoods.com rated the film 3/5 and quoted: "Go for this lighthearted hilarious product!" Indiaglitz.com called it a "feel-good entertainer" and further added: "Though the second half lags a bit, the movie is breezy cool and entertaining. Three cheers Balaji Mohan for a good debut venture".
The Telugu version Love Failure, too, fetched positive feedbacks. The Times of India critic Karthik Pasupleti gave the film 3.5 out of 5 and said: "Right from its unusual-yet-amusing characterization, the background score and the writing, the film is loaded with humour. As if that wasn't enough, it is nicely sugar coated from inside out". Radhika Rajamani from Rediff.com gave it 3.5 out of 5 and noted that the film was "refreshing", further citing: "It is well written and talks about love and failure in the context of life today. It gives an urbane, contemporary and realistic take on the subject. well written and talks about love and failure in the context of life today". Vishnupriya Bhandaram of The Hindu claimed: "Love Failure is a remarkably easy film to watch – no pressure, no headache. Right from the word go, its fresh, the narrative, the characters and the music". Hemanth Kumar of postnoon.com rated it 3.5 and described it as a "charming love story" and a "fantastic character study about people in love and the confusion that prevails over what the other person expects in a relationship". Idlebrain.com reviewer Jeevi, too, gave the film 3.5 out of 5, concluding that it was a "well-made urban romantic comedy told in a fresh an novel style [sic]".

Mount Arafat (), and by its other Arabic name, Jabal ar-Raḥmah (), is a granodiorite hill about southeast of Mecca, in the province of the same name in Saudi Arabia. The mountain is approximately in height, with its highest point sitting at an elevation of .
According to some Islamic traditions, the hill is the place where the Prophet Muhammad stood and delivered the Farewell Sermon, also known as the Khutbat al-Wada''', to their Sahabah (Companions) who had accompanied them for the Hajj towards the end of their life. Some Muslims also believe that Mount Arafat is the place where Adam and Eve (Hawa) reunited on Earth after falling from Heaven, believing the mountain to be the place where they were forgiven, hence giving it the name Jabal ar-Rahmah, meaning "Mountain of Mercy". A pillar is erected on top of the mountain to show where this event is believed to have taken place.
The mountain is especially important during the Hajj, with the 9th day of the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah, also known as the Day of 'Arafah after the mountain itself, being the day when Hajj pilgrims leave Mina for Arafat; this day is considered to be the most important day of the Hajj. The khutbah (sermon) is delivered and Zuhr and Asr prayers are prayed together in the valley. The pilgrims spend the whole day on the mountain invoking Allah to forgive their sins.
Geology and radiology
A 2012 study classified Mount Arafat as a granodiorite rock which mainly consists of feldspar, quartz and muscovite, among other minerals. Using petrographic, fission track dating and γ-spectrometric (HPGe) techniques in order to study the geology, thermal history and the radiological hazards due to the presence of primordial radionuclides.
The study yielded fission track age of 9.13 ± 1.05 Ma of the Mount Arafat granodiorite. In addition, the study reported that rifting, magmatism, volcanism and seafloor spreading that resulted in the formation of Red Sea seems to have altered the original age of the Arafat granodiorite under study to 9.13 ± 1.05 Ma. Measured radioactivity concentrations due to 226Ra, 232Th and 40K were found to not pose any radiological health hazard to the general public.
Hajj
Arafat rituals end at sunset and pilgrims then move to Muzdalifah for Maghrib prayer and a shortened Isha prayer and for a short rest.
The level area surrounding the hill is called the Plain of Arafat. The term Mount Arafat is sometimes applied to this entire area. It is an important place in Islam because, during the Hajj, pilgrims spend the afternoon there on the ninth day of Dhu al-Hijjah. Failure to be present in the plain of Arafat on the required day invalidates the pilgrimage.
Since late 2010, this place is served by Mecca Metro. On a normal Hajj, it would be around to walk.
In literature
The hill is referenced in James Joyce's novel Finnegans Wake''.

This was their 13th straight appearance in a and they were favored by
Washington
Under head coach Don James, Washington began the season ranked #19 in the polls. They responded with victories over Northwestern and #8 Michigan to rise to ninth. A loss to LSU dropped them to #18, but the Huskies responded with four straight wins to get back to #11. A loss to UCLA hurt their chances at a Pac-10 title, though they won their next two games to get back to #15 and in the hunt for a shared title before a matchup with Washington State in the Apple Cup at Husky Stadium. The underdog Cougars won again to ruin Washington's chance at a conference title, as the Huskies finished second to UCLA. This was their fifth straight bowl game and sixth in seven seasons.

Reception
The Allmusic review by Stephen Cook awarded the album 4½ stars, stating: "Soul Sauce is one of the highlights from Tjader's catalog with its appealing mixture of mambo, samba, bolero, and boogaloo styles... an album full of smart arrangements, subtly provocative vibe solos, and intricate percussion backing."

Halsbrücker Esse is a smokestack to the north of Halsbrücke near Freiberg in Saxony, Germany. It is also known as Hohe Esse or Halsbrück(e)ner Esse, Esse being an East Central German word for a smokestack.
With a height of it was the highest smokestack of the world at its completion (nowadays the Anaconda Smelter Stack in Montana is higher), and it remains the tallest brick building in Europe. It is a technical and industrial historical monument.
History
The Halsbrücker Esse was built on the eastern slope of the Freiberger Mulde between 22 September 1888 and 28 October 1889 by the smokestack building firm H.R. Heinicke from Chemnitz in order to provide a chimney for the exhaust fumes of the smelting works. It began service in April 1890 and has been in operation since.
Construction
The surface area of the building covers , the lower diameter being and the upper diameter . The chimney consists of 4,140 tons of fireproof clay bricks from the Grube Ilse near Senftenberg. The mortar consists of 170 tons of Bohemian lime, 1,030 tons of sand from the river Elbe and 60 tons of cement. The total mass has been estimated to be 5,400 tons. The chimney can be climbed using step irons on the inside and outside. To stabilise the chimney iron rings were attached which are spaced at the bottom of the chimney down to near the top. It is connected to the smelting works at the bottom of the valley by a long flue gas duct.
Environmental issues
The chimney was built in full knowledge of the environmental and health hazards posed by the noxious gases. The prevailing winds coming from the east to south-east, its construction achieved the goal of improving the air quality downwind in the vicinity. However, the problem was only shifted sideways by about into the Tharandt Forest where the environmental damage was soon noticed and studied.

The 2010 Major League Soccer season was the 98th season of FIFA-sanctioned soccer, the 32nd with a national first-division league, in the United States and Canada, and the 15th in MLS history. It began on March 25 at Seattle's Qwest Field with Seattle Sounders FC defeating the expansion Philadelphia Union, 2–0. The 2010 MLS All-Star Game was played at Reliant Stadium, hosted by the Houston Dynamo on July 28 as the MLS XI fell 5–2 to visiting Manchester United. The regular season concluded on October 24, with Los Angeles Galaxy winning the Supporters' Shield by one point over Real Salt Lake. Upon the completion of the regular season the 2010 MLS Cup Playoffs culminated on November 21 with a 2–1 victory by the Colorado Rapids over FC Dallas at Toronto's BMO Field. It was the first time the MLS Cup final was played outside the United States.
The expiration of and failure to sign a new collective bargaining agreement between the league and the players' union threatened the season. Negotiations resulted in a new contract being agreed to on March 20, 2010.
Changes from 2009
The players' union and league passed a new collective bargaining agreement that adjusted the players' contracts.
The Philadelphia Union joined the league as its 16th club and is playing in the Eastern Conference. Their first two home games of the season – against D.C. United April 10 and FC Dallas on May 15 – were played at Lincoln Financial Field while their permanent home, PPL Park in Chester, Pennsylvania, opened with a game against Seattle Sounders FC on June 27.
A natural grass field replaces the FieldTurf surface at Toronto FC's BMO Field.
The New York Red Bulls began play in their new stadium Red Bull Arena, defeating the Chicago Fire in the first MLS match played there on March 27 by the score of 1–0.
Adidas provided their Jabulani match ball with MLS colors of blue and green for the season, as well as new referee kits.
New Designated Player Rules were agreed upon early in the season:
Teams can sign two Designated Players, up from one under the previous rules, and pay a "luxury tax" of $250,000 for the right to sign a third Designated Player. The $250,000 would be distributed evenly to all MLS teams that have not signed a third Designated Player in the form of allocation money.
Each Designated Player counts as $335,000 for the salary cap, down from $415,000 under the previous agreement, and only counts as half that amount if the player is signed during the middle of the season. Teams can use allocation money to reduce the salary cap value of a Designated Player.
Teams are no longer allowed to trade for additional Designated Player spots, so the New York Red Bulls will receive $70,000 of allocation money in exchange for effectively nullifying their earlier trade with Chivas USA for a second Designated Player spot.
Teams who have a Designated Player transfer out of the country during the MLS season will recoup a portion of the money spent on the Designated Player.
Landon Donovan is no longer grandfathered into the agreement, and must be counted as a Designated Player.
Unlike the previous Designated Player agreement, which was set to expire after three seasons, this agreement has no set expiration date.
The new Designated Player rule resulted in an explosion of DP signings in 2010, with the league boasting 13 Designated Players at the conclusion of the regular season (Omar Bravo signed with Kansas City in the summer of 2010 but remained with their previous club Guadalajara for the remainder of the season).

Collective Bargaining Agreement
After two extensions to facilitate additional talks, the collective bargaining agreement between the league and the players' union expired February 25, 2010. The league had said that it would not lockout the players. The union had voted in favor of a strike if a new deal was not reached before the beginning of the season. Players were seeking free-agent rights and more guaranteed contracts from the league. On March 20, 2010, MLS and the Players' Union agreed on a new, 5-year collective bargaining agreement that allowed the season to start on time.
Competition format
The format for the 2010 season was as follows:
The season began on March 25 and ended on November 21 with MLS Cup 2010.
The 16 teams were split evenly into two conferences. The Eastern Conference has eight teams with the addition of the Philadelphia Union, and the Western Conference also has eight teams. For the first time in league history, the season had a balanced schedule where each team playing every other team in the league once at home and once away for a total of 30 games.
Games were not played during the group stage of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The last MLS game prior to the World Cup was played on June 10, with no games scheduled until after the group stage concluded on June 25.
The two teams in each conference with the most points qualified for the 2010 MLS Cup Playoffs. In addition, the next four highest ranked teams, regardless of conference, also qualified. Teams were bracketed by conference, with the lowest ranked teams crossing over to the other conference if necessary. In the Conference Semifinals, aggregate goals over two matches determined the winners. The Conference Finals were played as single matches, and the winners advanced to MLS Cup 2010. After the completion of any round, ties will be broken with two 15-minute periods of extra time, followed by a penalty kick shootout if necessary. The away goals rule was not used in any round.
The team with the most points in the regular season won the MLS Supporters' Shield and qualified directly into the Group Stage of the 2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League. The MLS Cup Winner also qualified for the Champions League Group Stage. The MLS Cup Runners-Up and the 2010 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup winners qualified for the Preliminary Round of the Champions League. If a team qualifies for multiple berths into the Champions League, then additional berths will be awarded to the highest-placed team(s) in the 2010 MLS regular season's overall standings that have not already qualified.
The four teams with the most points, regardless of conference, who have not qualified for the Champions League qualified for the SuperLiga 2011.
The six U.S.-based teams with the most points, regardless of conference, qualified for the third round of the 2011 U.S. Open Cup. The remaining U.S.-based MLS teams had to qualify for the remaining two berths via a series of play-in games.
As a Canadian-based team, Toronto FC cannot qualify for the Champions League through MLS, and cannot enter the U.S. Open Cup. In either case, any berth in the Champions League or U.S. Open Cup that it would have earned by its league position is awarded to the highest-placed team in the overall standings which has not already qualified. TFC may instead qualify for the Champions League through the Canadian Championship.

CONCACAF Champions League
The Columbus Crew continued their 2009–10 CONCACAF Champions League campaign that began during the previous season. They were defeated by Mexican club Toluca in the quarterfinals, 5–4 on aggregate.
Seattle Sounders FC became the first team to qualify for the 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League by winning the 2009 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. The Columbus Crew qualified next by winning the 2009 MLS Supporters' Shield. The Los Angeles Galaxy and Real Salt Lake also qualified by being the two 2009 MLS Cup finalists, while Toronto FC took the Canadian berth by virtue of their Canadian Championship win. Los Angeles, Seattle, and Toronto entered the competition in the preliminary round, while RSL and Columbus were seeded directly into the group stage.
Seattle and Toronto won their preliminary round ties, beating Isidro Metapán of El Salvador and Motagua of Honduras, respectively. Los Angeles crashed out of the preliminary round after losing their home match 4–1 to the Puerto Rico Islanders of the USSF D-2 Pro League and failing to make up the deficit in the away leg.
The group stage was held August 17 – Oct 21. Real Salt Lake won Group A with 13 points over Cruz Azul, Toronto, and Arabe Unido of Panama. Toronto finished in 3rd place with 8 points. Columbus finished 2nd in Group B behind Club Santos Laguna but ahead of C.S.D. Municipal of Guatemala and Joe Public F.C. of Trinidad. Seattle finished 4th in Group C with 3 points behind C.F. Monterrey, C.D. Saprissa of Costa Rica, and C.D. Marathón of Honduras.
On November 1, the draw for the Championship round was held. Real Salt Lake will face Columbus in the quarterfinal in February/March 2011, immediately prior to the 2011 MLS Regular Season.
SuperLiga
As was the case for the 2009 SuperLiga, the top four overall finishers in MLS in 2009 that hadn't already qualified for the Champions League qualified for SuperLiga. This year's competition was contested by the Houston Dynamo, the Chicago Fire, Chivas USA, and the New England Revolution from MLS. The four Mexican teams were Pachuca, Morelia, Puebla, and UNAM.
New England, Houston, Morelia and Puebla advanced from their groups, with the Revolution beating Puebla on penalties in one semifinal, and Morelia defeating Houston in the other. Morelia defeated New England 2–1 in the final at Gillette Stadium on September 1.
Domestic competitions
Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup
The top six overall teams from the 2009 MLS season (Columbus, Los Angeles, Houston, Seattle, Chicago, and Chivas USA) received automatic berths into the Third round of the 2010 U.S. Open Cup, while the eight remaining U.S.-based MLS teams and the expansion Philadelphia Union competed in a single-elimination qualification tournament to determine the MLS's final two official entrants into the competition. Teams were seeded one through nine, with the seventh-place MLS team from 2009 earning the first seed (and would play the winner of the eight v. nine play-in game), while each following team would receive its respective seed. The New York Red Bulls and D.C. United earned the final two MLS spots in the Third round.
For the first time since 2006, the semifinals were contested exclusively by MLS teams, with Seattle beating Chivas USA and Columbus defeating D.C. United. The final was played October 5 at Qwest Field in Seattle with the defending cup holders, the Sounders, defeating the Crew 2–1. The Sounders became the first MLS team ever to successfully defend the U.S. Open Cup, and the first team from any league to do so since New York Pancyprian-Freedoms in 1983.
Canadian championship
Toronto FC, as a Canadian-based MLS team, is not eligible to compete in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, and instead contested the Canadian Championship with the two Canadian-based teams in the Division-2 Pro League, Vancouver Whitecaps and Montreal Impact. Toronto FC won the tournament, claiming the Voyageurs Cup and Canada's entry into the Preliminary Round of the 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League.

Ooty varkey is a type of biscuit food, made out of wheat flour, rice, semolina, water, ghee, sugar and salt. It can be either deep fried or baked. It is considered a local colonial era re-interpretation of the French puff pastry.
History
Since the colonial rule, Ooty is famous for its Varkey. No one knows how or when it came in to existence or how it came to be called Varkey.
Efforts on GI (Geographical Indication) certification recognition
The president of Ooty Bakery Owners Association informed that if they are given GI certification it will be a boon to the bakers in Ooty. They obtain the raw materials domestically. The properties of the water and weather in Ooty gives Varkey a distinct taste.

is a Japanese sports manga by artist Hiroyuki Asada. Its main plot concerns the life of a team of high school basketball players. It is focused on action scenes which depict the matches played by the team, but also puts emphasis on the interaction of characters outside of the courts.
It was also adapted into a two-episode OVA, I'll CKBC (I'll / Crazy Kouzu Basketball Club). The opening theme for the first OVA episode is "Migite" by J-rock band Ellegarden, and the ending theme for the second episode is "Kaze no Hi", also by Ellegarden.
Plot
Akane Tachibana is a first-year student high school student who, despite their talent for basketball, decides to abandon sports clubs due to the pressure put on them by them. Once they arrive at Kouzu High, however, they meet the only other basketball player who has ever caught their eye on the courts and decides to join the team. The first match of the season is an exhibition game against the league's strongest team, Hyamazaki—the team that Hiiragi's father coaches and in which their older brother plays for. Hiiragi ends up playing in the second half of the game, and they seem to not be working well together on the court, losing the game, until unintentionally one of the senior players on the team challenges them to beat him. They join forces, inspiring the team to victory. Thus starts the story of a group of teenagers working to reach the top, fighting tooth and nail the entire way.

John P. Killilea (June 19, 1928 – January 27, 1996) was an American basketball coach and scout. They served as the assistant coach to four National Basketball Association (NBA) team; the Boston Celtics (1972–77), the Milwaukee Bucks (1977–1983), the New Jersey Nets (1983–85), the Houston Rockets (1989–1993). Killilea was hired by the Topeka Sizzlers of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) as their head coach in 1986 and served in that capacity until they were fired in January 1988 after being called for 15 technical fouls and ejected from three games.
Early life
Killilea graduated from Quincy High School in Quincy, Massachusetts in 1945. Following their graduation, they joined the United States Army Infantry Branch. Killilea enrolled at Boston University in 1948. They were named captain of the first-year student basketball team.
In 1949, Killilea was diagnosed with bulbar polio. During their hospital stay, which was paid in full by the March of Dimes, they were quarantined for 14 days. Upon their release from the hospital, Killilea was medically cleared to try out for the varsity Boston University basketball team. They made the team and came off the bench for the first two games of the season, but was inserted into the starting lineup for the remainder of the season.
In 1952, Killilea graduated from Boston University with a degree in physical education.
Coaching career
Killilea's first basketball coaching job was at Pemetic High School in Southwest Harbor, Maine in 1952. The following year, they coached the team to the Eastern Maine Basketball Championship. Killilea was head coach of the Melrose and Silver Lake high school basketball teams. They were inducted into the Massachusetts Basketball Coaches Association's Hall of Fame in 1976. Their combined high school head coaching record was 314–90.
Killilea was the first person in the Boston Celtics organization to scout Larry Bird. According to Killilea, Bird was "the best passing forward since Rick Barry."
In 1977, Don Nelson was hired as head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks. Nelson at first suggested their former assistant coach with the Celtics, John Killilea, for the job. When the Bucks insisted they wanted Nelson at the head coach position they brought Killilea on as their assistant. United Press International reporter Michael V. Uschan wrote an article on March 20, 1981, titled "Nelson matures as Bucks coach". It noted that, "Nelson depends on Killilea more than most other NBA coaches depend on their assistants". Killilea's salary with the Bucks was reportedly an annual salary of $60,000 to $70,000, a figure they claimed was comparable to an NBA head coaching salary.
Killilea resigned their position with Milwaukee at the conclusion of the 1983 season. They attended the Milwaukee Pen and Mike Club luncheon in 1984 and was quoted as saying, "There was no love lost between myself and the Milwaukee basketball team. [...] I guess we [Nelson] didn't get along." Bucks owner Jim Fitzgerald released a statement in March 1984 which read in part, "The Bucks offered John Killilea more loyalty, support and patience up front and behind the scenes than John Killilea will ever know. Don Nelson supported John in every possible way, but in several instances was repaid with disheartening lack of loyalty."
Before the 1983–84 season, Killilea joined the New Jersey Nets as an assistant coach under Stan Albeck. After the season a New York Post report cited several anonymous Nets players who blamed their poor performance on an ongoing feud between Killilea and assistant coach Herman Kull. Nets' owner Joe Taub and head coach Stan Albeck approached the Post reporter, Steve Baronfeld, telling them that Kull suffered a heart attack after reading the story. The Post responded by pulling their reporters from the Nets' beat.
An August 1983 United Press International report described Killilea as, "one of the most defense-minded coaches in the [NBA]."
Killilea was hired as the head coach for the Topeka Sizzlers of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) in July 1986. Their combined win–loss record with Topeka was 39–45. Killilea was fired in January 1988 and replaced by their assistant coach, John Darr. Killilea coached Topeka to a 13–17 record during the 1987–88 season and was called for 15 technical fouls.
Killilea died of cardiac arrest while boarding a flight in Denver, Colorado.

Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, sold under the brand name Epclusa among others, is a fixed-dose combination medication for the treatment of hepatitis C in adults. It combines sofosbuvir and velpatasvir. It is more than 90% effective for hepatitis C genotypes one through six. It also works for hepatitis C in those who also have cirrhosis or HIV/AIDS. It is taken by mouth.
In March 2020, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was approved for use in the United States to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) in children ages six years and older or weighing at least 37 pounds (17 kilograms) with any of the six HCV genotypes—or strains—without cirrhosis (liver disease) or with mild cirrhosis. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in combination with ribavirin is indicated for the treatment of children six years and older or weighing at least 37 pounds with severe cirrhosis.
The combination is generally well tolerated. Common side effects include headaches, fatigue, trouble sleeping, and nausea. The combination has not been studied in pregnant women or during breastfeeding. Greater care is required in those who are also infected with hepatitis B. Sofosbuvir works by blocking the NS5B protein and velpatasvir works by blocking the NS5A protein.
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was approved for medical use in the United States and in Europe in 2016. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.
Medical uses
A single tablet regimen is used for adults with genotype 1–6 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.
Contraindications
Combining sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with strong inducers of the liver enzymes CYP2B6, CYP2C8 or CYP3A4, or with P-glycoprotein, is contraindicated because such substances may reduce the effectiveness of the drug.
Side effects
Common side effects (in more than 10% of people) are headache, fatigue and nausea. In studies, severe side effects were experienced in 3% of patients, and 0.2% terminated the therapy because of adverse events. These effects occurred with similar frequencies in people treated with placebo.
Interactions
Pharmacokinetics
History
Beacon Pharmaceuticals in Bangladesh introduced a generic version product under the trade name of Sofosvel. Beacon received approval from the Directorate of Drug Administration, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, People's Republic of Bangladesh.
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was developed by the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2016. In the European Union it was approved in July 2016, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection in adults.
The safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for a 12-week treatment was evaluated in three Phase III clinical trials of 1,558 subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (mild cirrhosis). Results demonstrated that 95–99 percent of subjects who received sofosbuvir/velpatasvir had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment, suggesting the subjects' infections had been cured. The safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was also evaluated in a clinical trial of 267 subjects with decompensated cirrhosis (moderate to severe cirrhosis), of whom 87 subjects received sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in combination with ribavirin for 12 weeks, and 94 percent of these subjects had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment.
The pharmacokinetics (how the body absorbs, distributes and rids itself of a drug), safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, taken orally for 12 weeks, for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6 infection was established in an open-label, multicenter clinical trial that included a total of 173 treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced pediatric subjects ages six years and older without cirrhosis or with mild cirrhosis. No meaningful differences in pharmacokinetics were seen in pediatric subjects compared to adults. The safety and efficacy results were comparable to those observed in adults. In 102 subjects age 12 through 17, 93% of subjects with genotype 1 and 100% of subjects with genotypes 2, 3, 4 and 6 had no detectable virus in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment, suggesting the subjects' infection was cured. Among the 71 subjects ages 6 to 11 years with HCV genotypes 1, 2, 3 or 4, 93% with genotype 1, 91% with genotype 3 and 100% with genotypes 2 and genotype 4 had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment.
The safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for treatment of HCV genotype 5 in pediatric subjects six years and older or weighing at least 37 pounds without cirrhosis or with mild cirrhosis are supported by sofosbuvir and velpatasvir exposures in adults and pediatric subjects with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6 infection. Similar data were used to support dosing recommendations for pediatric subjects with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 infection who have severe cirrhosis.
The safety and effectiveness of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir have not been established in people less than six years of age.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir priority review and granted the approval of Epclusa to Gilead Sciences, Inc.

The Jewish Social Democratic Workers Association "Zukunft" was a Bundist organization in Stockholm, Sweden. The association (also using the name 'Social Democratic Group "Zukunft"') was founded in 1902. It was affiliated to the General Jewish Labour Bund via its Foreign Committee in Geneva. C. Zeitel was the secretary of the association.
During its initial year, the identity of the group was kept secret. As of 1907, the association claimed to have around 40 members. In the same year it contacted the Swedish Social Democratic Party and sought cooperation with them to host a public meeting on the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Bund. The meeting was organized by the arbetarkommun of Stockholm on October 8, 1907. Bernand Jofé of the Bund spoke at the meeting.
In October 1908, the Executive Committee of the Swedish Social Democratic Party granted 100 Swedish krona to the association, to set up a reading room for emigree activists in Stockholm. Another 100 krona was allotted by the Stockholm arbetarkommun. The reading room was set up in Folkets Hus, rented jointly by Zukunft and the Israeli Workers Association.
The support given from the Swedish Social Democrats to Zukunft caused a rift between the association and the Stockholm-based Support Group of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. The RSDLP group was led by Bernhard Mehr who claimed that since the Bund had merged into the RSDLP, the economic assistance should not have been given to Zukunft directly. A year later, the rift has settled and Zukunft, the Israeli Workers Association and the RSDLP support group decided to run the reading room jointly. The economic assistance from the Swedish Social Democratic Party was however discontinued.
Bundist activities continued in Sweden, at least late 1940s.

Platydesmida (Greek for platy "flat" and desmos "bond") is an order of millipedes containing two families and over 60 species. Some species practice paternal care, in which males guard the eggs.
Description
Platydesmidans have a flattened body shape with lateral extensions (paranota) on each segment. They lack eyes, and have between 30 and 110 body segments. They measure up to in length.
Behavior
While most millipedes feed on dead or decomposing leaf litter platydesmidans may be specialized to feed on fungi. Platydesmidans have also been studied with regard to parental investment, in that males of some species coil around eggs and young, a rare example of paternal care in arthropods. This behavior has been observed in species of Brachycybe from North America and Japan, and Yamasinaium from Japan, all are in the family Andrognathidae.
Evolutionary history
The only described fossil of the order is from the Mid Cretaceous (~100 Ma) Burmese amber, belonging to the extant genus Andrognathus, several undescribed specimens belonging to the order are known from the same deposit.
Distribution
Platydesmidans occur in North America, Central America, the Mediterranean region of Europe, Japan, China, southeast Asia and Indonesia.
Classification
The order contains two families.

The Survivor is the second novel of the Samuel Carver series by English thriller writer, Tom Cain, released on 7 July 2008 through Bantam Press. The novel was (somewhat paradoxically) released under the title No Survivors to the American audience.
Plot
The novel opens with Samuel Carver masquerading as a maintenance man. They sabotage the executive jet of wealthy Texan business person Waylon McCabe. The sabotage fails and McCabe begins to suspect that they were the target of an assassination as opposed to a victim of a freak accident. The novel then jumps forward to continue the story of Cain's first novel, The Accident Man. Carver is recovering in a Swiss hospital and attempting to regain memories lost during the torture by that book's villain.
The story centres around McCabe's attempt to obtain a lost Russian suitcase nuke in an effort to instigate a nuclear holocaust that would bring about the rapture; Carver aims to stop him.
Reception
The novel was relatively well-received, with reviewers praising its action scenes and complicated plot. Other critics of the novel cite Carver's relationship with Petrova and the impact of the first novel's subject material as flaws.
The Weekly Times stated that the book is "a complicated, complex and entertaining thriller". Writing for The Star-Ledger, Glenn Speer stated that "The action moves at a rapid clip due to Cain's short, snappy chapters that no doubt will ... enrapture their fans". Publishers Weekly were less effusive in their praise, simply stating that "most thriller fans will enjoy this roller-coaster action adventure ride".
Jeremy Jehu, reviewing for The Daily Telegraph gave the novel a mixed review, stating, "it's good, but saving the world just doesn't resonate like offing the People's Princess". Jehu also noted the difficulty in surpassing the earlier work's storyline. Sue Gammon, in a review for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation awarded the novel a rating of two and a half stars out of five, stating Cain's writing "isn't as polished as Childs", although they note that this is only Cain's second novel. They also stated that they found the scenes concerning the relationship between Carver and Petrova to be "where the plot drags"; they do, however, praise the novel's action scenes.

Review
About their work, the poet Bruce Smith has said:
Because Peter Johnson does not guide themselves either by the turns and counterturns of verse or the horizontal urge of prose, they must continually reinvent the wheel and its destination. They write with a lover's lavish extravagance and a yogi's self-discipline. Their funny poems are heartbreaking and their serious ones are hilarious.

Ellen Mooney Hancock (April 15, 1943 – April 19, 2022) was a technology manager from the United States who worked for IBM and Apple, among others.
Early life and education
Hancock was born April 15, 1943 in the Bronx, New York City, and raised in New York's Westchester County. They graduated from the College of New Rochelle and earned a master's degree in mathematics from Fordham University.
Career
IBM
Hancock spent 29 years at IBM, where they rose to senior vice president in charge of network hardware and software. They ran the networking hardware division through the first half of the 1990s, at a time when it saw double-digit losses in market share year after year. (The division was ultimately sold to Cisco in 1999.) They were also a member of the IBM Corporate Executive Committee and the IBM Worldwide Management Council.
National Semiconductor
In September 1995, they were hired away from IBM by Gil Amelio to become National Semiconductor's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer (COO). They worked closely with Amelio to move National Semiconductor to profitability. During that time, Hancock worked with National's CompactRISC architecture, which was a forerunner to the successful ARM7 architecture.
Apple
Not long after that Amelio left to take the CEO position at Apple Computer, and in July 1996 they hired them to join them there.
At Apple, they took over the Chief Technology Officer role in the midst of the floundering next-generation Copland operating system (OS) project. They were largely responsible for the decision to cancel Copland. To replace it, Hancock had favored Sun Microsystems's Solaris operating system over NeXT Inc.'s NeXTSTEP, and was against the eventual purchase of NeXT. Even after the deal was done, they wanted to use at least the kernel of Solaris. With NeXT came Steve Jobs, who publicly lampooned them on several occasions calling them a "bozo". When the Apple board of directors fired Amelio, Jobs reorganized the company leaving them with a much reduced role in charge of quality assurance as former NeXT executives took over many positions in Apple. They soon resigned.
Exodus Communications
After Apple they took a CEO position with Exodus Communications in March 1998 and became chairperson of the board in 2000. Exodus set a Nasdaq record of 19 consecutive quarters of 40 percent quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. In 2000, the $29 billion market cap exceeded even that of their former employer, Apple Computer. However, in 2001 the company became part of the dot-com crash, the stock plummeted and Hancock stepped down as CEO in September 2001. The company filed for bankruptcy that same month, followed by an asset purchase by Cable & Wireless in February 2002. Savvis Communications purchased the related assets from C&W in November 2004.
Acquicor
Hancock served as President, COO, and secretary to the board of Acquicor, a company they co-founded with former Apple-CEO Gil Amelio and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. The company was a 'blank check' holding company, or "SPAC". Acquicor acquired Jazz Semiconductor in February 2007 and Hancock resigned on June 7, 2007.
Memberships
Hancock was a member on the boards of several companies and academic and nonprofit institutions, including Aetna, Colgate-Palmolive, Electronic Data Systems, Ripcord Networks, Marist College, Santa Clara University, and the Pacific Council on International Policy.
Death
Ellen Hancock died April 19, 2022.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of non-pharmaceutical interventions colloquially known as lockdowns (encompassing stay-at-home orders, curfews, quarantines, and similar societal restrictions) have been implemented in numerous countries and territories around the world. These restrictions were established with the intention to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. By April 2020, about half of the world's population was under some form of lockdown, with more than 3.9 billion people in more than 90 countries or territories having been asked or ordered to stay at home by their governments. Although similar disease control measures have been used for hundreds of years, the scale of those implemented in the 2020s is thought to be unprecedented.
Research and case studies have shown that lockdowns are generally effective at reducing the spread of COVID-19, therefore flattening the curve. The World Health Organization's recommendation on curfews and lockdowns is that they should be short-term measures to reorganize, regroup, rebalance resources, and protect health workers who are exhausted. To achieve a balance between restrictions and normal life, the WHO recommends a response to the pandemic that consists of strict personal hygiene, effective contact tracing, and isolating when ill.
Although many public health experts and economists supported lockdown restrictions, citing greater long-term costs for allowing the disease to spread uncontrollably, pandemic restrictions have had health, social, and economic impacts, and have been met with protests in some territories.
Efficacy
Several researchers, from modeling and demonstrated examples, have concluded that lockdowns are effective at reducing the spread of, and deaths caused by, COVID-19. Lockdowns are thought to be most effective at containing or preventing COVID-19 community transmission, healthcare costs and deaths when implemented earlier, with greater stringency, and when not lifted too early.
There is disagreement about the size of the effect of lockdowns on COVID-19 mortality. A systematic review with Johns Hopkins University by economists concluded that lockdowns as opposed to guidelines or medical advice had little to no effects on COVID-19 mortality. The authors attribute the differences in findings to an earlier review to its inclusion of modelling studies.
A study investigating the spread based on studies of the most common symptoms such as loss of taste and smell in France, Italy and the UK showed a marked decrease in new symptoms just a few days after the start of confinement on the countries (Italy and France) with the strongest lockdowns. Modelling on the United States pandemic suggested "the pandemic would have been almost completely suppressed from significantly taking off if the lockdown measures were implemented two weeks earlier" and that the second wave would have been less severe had the lockdown lasted another two weeks.
The stringent lockdown in Hubei in early 2020 proved effective at controlling the COVID-19 outbreak in China. The relatively high number of cases and deaths in Sweden, which has kept much of its society open during the pandemic, when compared to its neighbours with comparable demographics Norway, Denmark and Finland that did enforce lockdowns, is thought to be at least partly attributable to this difference in policy. Similarly, modelling on Australian data concluded that achieving zero community transmission through a strict lockdown lowers healthcare and economic costs compared to less stringent measures that allow transmission to continue, and warned that early relaxation of restrictions have greater costs. This "zero community transmission" approach was adopted in Australia, and a strict four month lockdown in the state of Victoria during an outbreak in Melbourne, combined with other measures, averted a wider outbreak in the country in 2020. New Zealand and Vietnam also adopted a "Zero-COVID" strategy throughout 2020 that included targeted lockdowns.
The emergence of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in 2021 has led some commentators to suggest that although lockdowns continue to reduce the spread of COVID-19, they have become less effective at containing it. Lockdowns in Australia and Vietnam in response to Delta outbreaks proved less effective at containment than previous lockdowns were against the spread of other variants.
Voluntary versus mandatory restrictions
One study led by an economist at the University of Chicago found that involuntary lockdowns had little impact, with voluntary distancing making up nearly 90% of the fall in consumer traffic as people feared the virus itself. Similarly, a National Bureau of Economic Research study found stay-at-home orders increased staying at home by just 5–10%. Another study from Yale University found that most social distancing was voluntary, driven primarily by "media coverage of morbidity and mortality."
On the other hand, some studies have argued that coercive measures probably decreased interactions, while accepting that most of the reduction may have been voluntary. One of those two studies, by Flaxman et al., has been criticized, among other things for having a country-specific adjustment factor, without which the model would predict a massive number of deaths for Sweden. One widely cited economic simulation asserting that shelter-in-place orders reduced total cases three-fold, however, held voluntary distancing constant. Another study found a 30% difference among border-counties where stay-at-home orders were imposed.
Another study that compared the impact of 'less restrictive interventions' on the spread of COVID-19 in Sweden and South Korea, with mandatory stay-at home orders in 8 other countries, such as France and Spain, did not find evidence for greater disease control in the countries with more restrictions. However, the findings of the study have been questioned due to its numerous limitations, including the small sample size of countries.
Some research has also found that an "advisory" approach is not adequate to control COVID-19 outbreaks. An analysis of an outbreak in northern Italy found that an effective reduction in community transmission occurred during a strict national lockdown, and that earlier less stringent measures were ineffective at reducing mobility to a level low enough to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, Google has consistently collected data on movements, showing rapid declines in public activity long before legal restrictions were imposed. An April 2020 poll found that 93% of Americans voluntarily chose to only leave home when necessary, regardless of legal restrictions.
Reception
A February 2021 review of 348 articles concluded there was acknowledgement of the importance of non-pharmaceutical interventions in controlling the spread of COVID-19. However, current research also acknowledges high societal costs, though less than the costs of allowing the pandemic to spread without mitigation.
Related to epidemiology
Epidemiological evidence supports generalized non-pharmaceutical interventions to curb the spread of COVID-19.
During the early stages of the pandemic in Europe and the United States, statistical modeling which advised that restrictions were helpful to prevent a large number of deaths were used as the basis for lockdowns. This includes an Imperial College projection, led by epidemiologist Neil Ferguson. Despite some criticisms, academics defended the Imperial projection as fundamentally sound, while admitting the code was "a buggy mess."
A notable opponent of lockdowns has included Sweden's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, who has frequently criticised the strategy. The Swedish government's approach has included minimal restrictions and has been controversial in part due to the relatively high death toll due to widespread transmission. However, the Swedish government began considering enacting a lockdown in early 2021.
While arguing in August 2020 for the need for further lockdowns in the United States, physicians Ranu Dhillon and Abraar Karan argued for "smarter lockdowns" that impose restrictions on areas with high levels of transmission, and to increase support to vulnerable populations in these locations to offset the economic costs.
A number of medical experts signed the Great Barrington Declaration in October 2020 which called for "Focused Protection" on high risk groups and minimal restrictions on the general population to achieve herd immunity through COVID-19 infection. However, the majority of medical experts and the WHO have strongly criticised this proposed strategy for its lack of scientific basis and for being unethical. The declaration has also attracted controversy over its funding and the authenticity of its signatures.
Related to social impacts
Some commentators have suggested that states' use of emergency powers to curb freedom of assembly and movement are authoritarian and may result in long-term democratic backsliding. Centralization of power by political leadership in Hungary, Poland, China and Cambodia in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have been cited as examples.
Some researchers have noted that COVID-19 pandemic restrictions have come with mental health costs, compounded by those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic itself.
Due to their closure, educational institutions worldwide transitioned to online learning. Teachers and faculty had to learn new ways to engage with students while in a COVID-19 pandemic. Examples of online teaching tools are podcasts, videos, and virtual classrooms.
UN Women warned in an April 2020 report that COVID-19 pandemic restrictions exacerbate gender inequalities and have led to an increase in domestic violence. Many women are being forced to 'lockdown' at home with their abusers at the same time that services to support survivors are being disrupted or made inaccessible. For instance, in France there was a spike in cases of about 30% since the lockdown in March 2020.
Related to economic impacts
Some economists supported increased government funding for mitigation efforts, even at the cost of tolerating a very large economic contraction. They agreed that lockdowns should continue until the threat of resurgence has declined, even when considering only the economic impact. There was a general agreement, at least in some economic circles, that "severe lockdowns — including closing non-essential businesses and strict limitations on people's movement — are likely to be better for the economy in the medium term than less aggressive measures".
Both the World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have published statements noting the impact of the lockdowns on livelihoods and food security, and Dr David Nabarro, WHO Special Envoy on COVID-19 stated in October 2020 that "lockdowns just have one consequence that you must never ever belittle, and that is making poor people an awful lot poorer".
Protests
There have also been a number of protests worldwide in opposition to lockdowns, including in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, the Netherlands, Canada and New Zealand. The motivations for and sizes of these protests have varied. Some have been spurred by the economic and social impacts of lockdowns, but have also been associated with misinformation related to the pandemic, conspiracy theories and anti-vaccination.
Table of pandemic lockdowns
In the table pandemic lockdowns are defined as the shutdown of parts of the economy, due to non-pharmaceutical anti-pandemic measures and are enforceable by law like:
Closing of schools and kindergartens
Closing of non-essential shops (shops and stores apart from food, doctors and drug stores)
Closing of non-essential production
Cancellation of recreational venues and closing of public places
Curfews
Stay-at-home orders and total movement control
These measures are considered to have caused the COVID-19 recession in 2020.
The table does not contain:
Measures with smaller economic impacts like:
border closures
social distancing measures and social movement restrictions
travel restrictions.
Other non-pharmaceutical anti-pandemic measures like mandatory quarantines after travel, self quarantine and social distancing measures
Any measures which are voluntary rather than enforceable by law
The pandemic has resulted in the largest number of shutdowns/lockdowns worldwide at the same time in history..
By 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which increased to 3.9 billion people by the first week of April – more than half of the world's population.
Major restrictions first began in China, with other countries in East Asia like Vietnam soon following it in implementing widespread containment measures. Much of Europe, North America and Africa took much longer to bring in tough measures. Lockdowns between and within nations are of varying stringency.
By mid April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, with around 100 million in the Philippines and about 59 million in South Africa, while around 1.3 billion were under lockdown in India, which was the largest of all lockdowns.
By the end of April, around 300 million people were under lockdown in various countries of Europe, including but not limited to Italy, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom; while around 200 million people were under lockdown in Latin America.

Rama Kamat (died 1720) was a Mumbai (Bombay)-based business person and philanthropist. The records of their life are scanty. They were connected with the command of Indian troops under the British and had some connections with Kanhoji Angre.
They paid for the reconstruction of the Walkeshwar Temple in 1715 and also donated a temple on Parsi Bazaar Street.  They are on record as one of the honoured guests at the inauguration of St. Thomas' Cathedral on Christmas Day, 1718.
The governor, Charles Boone, found a piece of paper that said that Kamat was working with Boones arch-enemy Kanhoji Angre. The paper was a forgery by one of Kamat's friends but Boone was so angry that they tortured and killed Kamat and then one day later learned that Kamat never helped Angre. Boone paid money to Kamat's family hoping for forgiveness.

Ivan Vaughan (18 June 1942 – 16 August 1993) was a boyhood friend of John Lennon and later a schoolmate of Paul McCartney at the Liverpool Institute, both commencing school there in September 1953. They were born in Liverpool on the same day as McCartney. They played tea-chest bass part-time in Lennon's first band, The Quarrymen, and was responsible for introducing Lennon to McCartney at a community event (the Woolton village fête) on 6 July 1957, where The Quarrymen were performing. McCartney impressed Lennon, who invited them to join the band, which they did a week later. This led to the formation of Lennon and McCartney's songwriting partnership and, later, of The Beatles.
Personal life
Vaughan studied classics at University College London, married in 1966 and settled down to family life with a son and daughter.
From 1973 to 1983, Vaughan taught Psychology at Homerton College. On grounds of ill health, they had to take early retirement.
Lennon and McCartney never forgot the friend who brought them together. For a time they put Vaughan on the payroll of their Apple company, in charge of a plan that never took off to set up a school with a sixty, hippie-style education ethos. Vaughan's wife Jan, a language teacher, helped McCartney with the French lyrics to the Beatles 1965 song "Michelle".
Autobiographic and documentary
In 1977, Vaughan was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Their book, Ivan: Living with Parkinson's Disease, was published in 1986, and they featured in a documentary produced for the BBC in 1984 by Patrick Uden, hosted by Jonathan Miller about their search for a cure. They died in 1993 of pneumonia.
Vaughan's death touched Paul McCartney so deeply that they began to write poetry for the first time since they were a child. They wrote the poem "Ivan" about them after their death, which was published in McCartney's 2001 book Blackbird Singing.

Sampson Kempthorne (1809–1873) was an English architect who specialised in the design of workhouses, before their emigration to New Zealand.
Life
They were the son of Rev. John Kempthorne. They began practising in Carlton Chambers on Regent Street in London. Their father was a friend of the Poor Law Commissioner Thomas Frankland Lewis, which may have helped them to get the commission to build workhouses.
Kempthorne came up with two designs – the square plan and the hexagonal or "Y" plan – both contained sections for the different types of inmates (men, women, boys, girls, infirm). The space between different wings was used to provide areas where inmates could exercise – segregated from the other groups.
Kempthorne designed workhouses in Abingdon, Andover, Bath, Crediton, Hastings, and Newhaven.
They also designed some cheaply built Gothic churches, including Holy Trinity (1834–35) (destroyed by bombing in 1940) and All Saints (1839), both in Rotherhithe, and St James, in Upton Street, Gloucester, originally built as a chapel-of-ease to the nearby church of St Michael, of which their father was rector.
In January 1838 they married Marianne, the fourth daughter of the Rev. Josiah Pratt.
Kempthorne emigrated to New Zealand with their wife, arriving in May 1842. They took with them a prefabricated wooden cottage. having already purchased a piece of land at Parnell, where they settled. They were engaged by Bishop George Selwyn to build some stone Gothic churches but their first two attempts, St Thomas's at Tamaki (1847) and St Stephen's at Judges Bay (1848), proved structurally unsound and were soon demolished.
Their assistant for a short time in 1834–35 was George Gilbert Scott, who went on, in partnership with William Moffat, to begin their independent architectural career as a specialist in the design of workhouses.

Saint Henri Square (), known officially as Saint Henri Park ()) is a town square in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is centrally located in the Saint Henri neighbourhood of the Le Sud-Ouest borough. The square is bordered by Saint Antoine Street West to the north, Agnes Street to the west, Place Guay to the south and Laporte Avenue to the east.
In 1890, the former city of Saint Henri acquired some land adjacent to Saint Antoine Street to create a small public park. It would become the first public park in Saint Henri.
The square is surrounded by Victorian row houses and triplexes which were built for members of the local elite.
Jacques Cartier Monument
A commission for a monument to the French explorer Jacques Cartier was made shortly thereafter to Quebec sculptor Joseph-Arthur Vincent. In 1893, this statue was installed and unveiled in the centre of the square. It stands tall and was made of cast iron.
In the 1990s, the Cartier statue was replaced with a replica because the original had deteriorated due to exposure. In 1992, working from both original and archival photographs, sculptor Jules Lasalle produced a faithful copy. The original statue was then relocated to the Place Saint Henri metro station.

From 1868 until their death in 1899,The Oaks was the home of Major Jedediah Hotchkiss. Hotchkiss made their mark in a number of fields including mapmaking, surveying, land and coal speculation, and education. During the Civil War, Hotchkiss first served under Gen. Robert E. Lee as topographical engineer, and then joined Gen. Stonewall Jackson's staff in the same capacity, soon becoming one of the General's closest aides. Their campaign maps, now housed at the Library of Congress, are considered by Civil War historians to be among the finest ever made. Hotchkiss returned to Staunton after the war ended and began speculating in land and minerals. They also lectured and wrote extensively about Virginia's geology, geography, and Civil War history.
There was a house on the site when Hotchkiss bought the property in 1868. A large addition to the rear of this original house appears on their 1884 map, and tax records for this period reveal a doubling of assessed building value in 1876 and another significant rise again in 1884. The chalet-style rear wing could have been built around this time. The main front was erected in 1888 on the site of the original building, perhaps incorporating part of the original foundations into its own. Assisted by the Boston architectural firm of Winslow & Wetherell, it is believed that much of the credit for the design and detailing of The Oaks goes to Hotchkiss, who supervised its construction very closely until its completion in 1890.
Defying conventional style categorization, The Oaks's exterior displays many elements of the Shingle Style, although -it is·executed in brick. The somewhat restrained facade belies the richness of its interior which features seven magnificent mantelpieces executed by local craftsmen, tongue-and-groove cedar paneling and wainscoting, stained-glass windows, brass lighting fixtures, built-in cupboards, bookshelves, and a unique stand-up desk.
Unique in its design, The Oaks is difficult to categorize using conventional stylistic terms. The 21-room, 3-story structure exhibits some elements of the Shingle Style, although it is executed in brick, with various bonding patterns. The rather restrained facade is organized into three main bays, and the whole is crowned by a complex hip roof with carved modillion blocks in the cornice. The front of the lot is surrounded by an iron fence with an acorn motif on the posts.
The right bay consists of a recessed entrance with a sleeping porch above. Both these porches, and the sleeping porch on the top level ·of the left bay, are recessed under the roofline, a typical feature of the Shingle Style. The central bay is dominated by a 3-part, round-headed window on the second level; a stained-glass window with oak and floral motifs is fitted into the semicircular arch. Three doors, placed one above the other, originally led to small balconies. The protruding, 5-sided bay on the left features brick string courses and an open wedge pattern of rubbed bricks forming the joints between each side. Both side elevations have protruding bays with stained-glass panels in the windows on the second level.
The rear portion of the house is a 3-story, brick chalet-style structure. The gable roof has extremely wide eaves which extend approximately 4 feet from the walls. Unusually large triangular wooden brackets with chamfered edges support the rafters which have carved ends. There are two small wooden balconies off the top-story windows on the north and south sides of this wing.
There are also two outbuildings on the property. One is a 2-bay carriage house with segmental-arched openings which have been made rectangular with large concrete lintels; a loft is located under the shed roof. The other outbuilding appears to have been built in two stages and is now connected to the main house by a raised walkway. Although its original use is not known, part of it at one time did house Hotchkiss's gravity-flow water system.
The main hall is located on the second level of the central bay. This huge room has an open staircase of oak, pine and mahogany with paneled wainscoting and turned balusters; there is a bench built along the staircase wall. Nine-panel doors lead into the adjoining music room and library. The library is located in the protruding left bay and features Hotchkiss's unusual stand-up desk, a built-in bookcase covering an entire wall and a nicely paneled mantelpiece with slender, turned colonettes in the overmantel and small display shelves flanking the fireplace opening. The music room's woodwork is all painted an ivory color. This was originally the parlor and is located in the right bay behind the entrance porch.
On the first level, the largest room is the original dining room. The unusual built-in cupboard has paneled and glass doors, mirrors and spiral colonettes. Across the hall from the dining room is the old breakfast room which contains the door to Hotchkiss's enormous walk-in safe located under the entrance porch (it was here that they housed all their now highly- valued map collection).
The third level contains the bedrooms which open onto a huge central hall. It is less ornate than the main living level, but there are two mantelpieces of note.
The older rear wing of The Oaks connects to the front section in all three levels. In the basement of the wing is a large fireplace opening, which indicates that this room was probably the original kitchen. The second level of the wing now contains a small kitchen behind an additional dining room. In this room is a very simple mantelpiece which consists of pilasters supporting an undecorated frieze and mantel shelf. The original staircase of the wing remains in a hall between this dining room and the newer front addition. The third level of the wing contains an additional bedroom and bath. The flooring of the back wing is random-width pine, and all of the woodwork and molding is much simpler than that in the 1888 front section of The Oaks.
The Oaks is in private ownership.

Péter Sebestyén (born May 16, 1994) is a Hungarian motorcycle racer, competing in the 2022 Supersport World Championship for the Evan Bros. Yamaha team. They have raced in the Superbike World Championship, the FIM Superstock 1000 Cup, the 2010 and 2011 125cc World Championships, the Spanish 125GP Championship, the German 125GP Championship, the European Junior Cup and the Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup.
Career
Sebestyén entered the 2007 Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup aged only 13, and had to miss the first round of Spain in March, due to the minimum age requirement, as they would only turn 13 in May. They would race in rounds 2-8, scoring two point scoring finishes: a 13th place in Italy, and a 12th place in Germany. They finished the season 22nd in the standings, with seven points.
They stayed for the 2008 Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup as well, this time scoring points in six races, including a 6th place in Britain, and an 8th place in Germany. They finished the season 15th in the rider's championship, with 28 points.
In 2009, after their best results included the German GP in both seasons in the Red Bull Rookies Cup, they raced a full year in the German 125cc GP Championship, with moderate success.
In 2010, Sebestyén raced in the Spanish 125cc GP Championship, and performed well enough to earn themselves three wild-card appearances in the 2010 125cc World Championship. They finished 23rd in Catalonia, retired in Aragon, and finished 17th in the season-closer at Valencia.
Their wild-card results earned them a full ride for the 2011 125cc World Championship season, racing for Caretta Technology Forward Team. They struggled during the year, scoring no points, and a season's best finish of 18th in Valencia.
In 2012 and 2013, Sebestyén raced in the European Junior Cup by KTM. They scored no points in 2012, but finished in the points seven times out of eight races in 2013, including a second place in Magny-Cours. They ended the season 6th in the rider's championship, scoring 67 points.

James Fenwick Lansdowne, (August 8, 1937 – July 27, 2008) was a self-taught Canadian wildlife artist.
Career
Lansdowne was born in Hong Kong of English parents and grew up in Victoria, British Columbia. Stricken with polio at eleven months, they were nurtured by their mother, Edith Lansdowne, to walk. A painter herself, they also provided their first lessons in painting and continued to supply whatever help they could. Later, in high school, the staff of the Royal British Columbia Museum encouraged them in studying birds, and gave them a job as a laboratory assistant for three summers. They held their first show in 1952 at the Royal British Columbia Museum when they were fourteen, their second show at the Royal Ontario Museum in 1956. They had their first international exhibition in New York in 1958 at the headquarters of the National Audubon Society. In 1960, they had an exhibition at the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, then, in 1961, they had an exhibition at the Tryon Gallery (today`s Rountree Tryon Gallery) in London, England. From then on, they exhibited their work in centres world-wide.
Lansdowne`s creative process involved observation from life and from preserved specimens. Their detailed watercolours of birds have frequently been compared with the work of John James Audubon - they often feature a specific species against a largely white background - but their subjects tend to display a greater lifelike quality and more natural postures than Audubon's. Their work is in such public collections as the Royal Ontario Museum, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria and in the collection of the Princess Royal and Duke of Edinburgh. Their work was presented to members of the British Royal Family by the Government of Canada.
In 1976, Lansdowne was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 1995, they were awarded the Order of British Columbia. In 1974, they were elected a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.
They died in Victoria, BC in 2008.
Personal life
Since Lansdowne had had polio, they walked with crutches and only could paint with their left hand.

Lesbian/Woman (1972; second edition 1991) is a work by the feminist and gay rights activists Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon, in which the authors discuss what it means to be a lesbian. The book was influential and is considered a foundational text of lesbian feminism. Reviewers believed that it benefited from its authors' personal experience as lesbians, and endorsed its criticisms of the treatment of lesbians by religious and professional organizations.
Summary
Martin and Lyon discuss lesbianism, arguing that the subject is surrounded by "myths and stereotypes", such as the idea that being a lesbian is solely or primarily a matter of sexual behavior and feelings, that lesbians molest children and seduce young women, and that a woman's sexual orientation can be determined from their appearance. They argue that lesbian women are diverse and have a range of different experiences and backgrounds. They describe their personal experiences as lesbians, and write that for a woman being a lesbian is "a way of life" that "involves the structure of their whole personality". Other topics explored include butch and femme roles.
Although they note that some lesbians believe that they were born lesbians, they write that they, "tend to feel that persons are born sexual: not heterosexual or homosexual, just sexual." They argue that a woman's sexual orientation depends upon their individual experiences and reactions to them, and that it can develop slowly, emerging from their awareness as a girl that they felt different.
Publication history
First published in 1972, Lesbian/Woman was republished in an expanded edition in 1991.
Reception
Early reviews
Lesbian/Woman received a positive review from Carol Leard in The Body Politic and a mixed review from Diane Trzcinski in Lesbian Tide. The book was also reviewed by Sisters, Amazon Quarterly, the Journal of Sex Research, and Julia P. Stanley in the Journal of Homosexuality.
Leard considered Lesbian/Woman "positive and enlightened", and credited Martin and Lyon with demonstrating "a full and realistic appreciation of what it means to be a woman and a Lesbian in contemporary society", and having provided an "authentic and factual" discussion of the topic that benefited from their personal experience as lesbians. They considered the book a useful counter to stereotypes about lesbians and welcomed its advice to parents not to send their daughters to therapists interested in changing their sexual orientation. They found the final chapter "liberating in itself" in its "vibrant demand for liberation", endorsing its criticism of "the Church and professional associations".
Trzcinski wrote that Lesbian/Woman would prove useful to feminists because of its history of the lesbian and lesbian feminist movements in the United States. They maintained that it benefited from Martin and Lyon's personal experience as lesbians, and credited them with accurately assessing the "three main sources of institutionalized oppression of lesbians" as organized religion, the medical profession, and the government. They also endorsed Martin and Lyon's criticism of psychoanalytic theories of lesbianism. However, they found that the book "too often reads as an apology", and believed that Martin and Lyon were wrong to demand that society give lesbians love and respect, writing that this was impossible given "the way society is presently constituted". They also questioned why lesbians should want the love and respect of society, given the way it treated them. They also maintained that while Martin and Lyon's account of lesbianism was accurate as far as it went, it ignored "the various alternatives now open to lesbians."
Later evaluations
Jennifer Terry described Lesbian/Woman as "a foundational text of lesbian-feminism". They commented that in many respects it, "resembles previous social scientific surveys and early psychiatric case histories produced as a result of voluntary lesbian participation in studies." They added that, "One can identify a similarity in the discursive structure of the subjects' self-descriptions reported in Lesbian/Woman and those of the early psychiatric interviews that were part of the Sex Variants study of the 1930s."
In 2004, The Advocate listed Lesbian/Woman as one of the "100 Best Lesbian and Gay Nonfiction Books" ever written. Tina Gianoulis, writing for GLBTQ Social Sciences, described Lesbian/Woman as an influential book, adding that Martin and Lyon's understanding of what it means to be a lesbian "not only opened the door for women who had never been sexual with women to see themselves as lesbians, but it also laid the foundation for a woman-identified subculture that became the basis for the lesbian movement of the 1970s." Gianoulis added that it was Martin and Lyon's "most significant book" and that it "remains a crucial account of American lesbian life in the twentieth century".

The Friedrich Ebert Foundation (German: Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung e.V.; Abbreviation: FES) is a German political party foundation associated with, but independent from, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Established in 1925 as the political legacy of Friedrich Ebert, Germany's first democratically elected President, it is the largest and oldest of the German party-associated foundations. It is headquartered in Bonn and Berlin, and has offices and projects in over 100 countries. It is Germany's oldest organisation to promote democracy, political education, and promote students of outstanding intellectual abilities and personality.
History
The FES was named after Friedrich Ebert (1871–1925), the Social Democratic President of Germany, 1919–1925. In their will, they specified that the proceeds from donations at their funeral should be used to create a foundation. The SPD chairperson at the time, , was given the responsibility of building this foundation, which they did a few days after Ebert's death in 1925. The main concern of the foundation was to work against discrimination of workers in the area of education: "The Friedrich Ebert Foundation pursues the goal of giving young, empowered proletarians government aid to fund an education at state-accredited institutions. As a basic principle, only those people who have a recommendation from the party organisation will receive funding." (SPD Yearbook 1926) By the end of 1931, 295 students had been funded with over 52,000 marks. At this point the funding of the foundation fell through, as a result of the Great Depression. The FES was a section of the Social Democratic Education and Culture Organisation, and was banned along with the party itself in 1933 by the Nazis.
In 1946, the FES was reinstituted at the founding assembly of the Socialist German Student Federation. In 1954, the FES was restructured into a charitable organisation "for the advancement of democratic education". This established the FES as an independent, self-contained institute. In addition to education programmes, the FES has also worked in the area of development aid since the 1960s. In this effort, it has supported democracy and freedom movements, for instance in the African National Congress (ANC), and played an important role in overcoming dictatorial regimes in Greece, Spain, and Portugal. Thus it was not a coincidence that the Socialist Party of Portugal was formed in an FES school in the German town of Bad Münstereifel.
The German state did subsidize the work of the foundation with 170 Million Euros in 2018.
Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Academic Foundation
The Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Academic Foundation (FES) is one of thirteen state-funded organizations for the promotion of young talents (Begabtenförderwerke) in Germany. Less than 1% of German students achieve a scholarship at one of the thirteen organizations (i.e. FES, Studienstiftung, Konrad Adenauer Foundation, Friedrich Naumann Foundation, Hanns Seidel Foundation, Heinrich Böll Foundation, Rosa Luxemburg Foundation, Cusanuswerk, Ernst Ludwig Ehrlich Scholarship Fund). It is financially funded and subsidized by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and supports students with outstanding academical and political achievements. Awards are granted after a multi-stage selection process and are based on grades, letters of recommendation, letters of motivation, political and social engagement as well as personality and character. Until today it has sponsored more than 12,000 grantees. Over 90% of those sponsored graduate with honours. In 2005, there were 1,731 students in the programme, of which 51% were women.
Beyond the financial support, grantees also receive so-called ideational support, which comes from opportunities to attend political seminars, conferences, and other activities, which can be important job qualifications. Students are assigned advisors who work with them for the length of their grants.
Each year, the grantees vote for a board during the nationwide conference at the Gustav Stresemann Institute in Bonn. This board serves for the next full year as the representation of grantees for dialog with the foundation. The FES maintains a website ( www.fes-stip.de) for networking among grantees, which includes a wide variety of mailing lists, services, and communications tools.
Since 1971, foreign students have also had the opportunity to receive grants through solidarity funds. Preference for these grants goes to people who are persecuted on political, racial or religious grounds. Funding for this program comes exclusively from donations from current and former grantees. The program have helped over 1,000 students. Currently there are 31 students who are in the solidarity programme. Two grantees from this programme are chosen every year at the conference in Bonn to work on the steering committee of the fund.
Further activities
Today, the Friedrich Ebert Foundation's main goals are to promote political and societal education of people from all walks of life in the spirit of democracy and pluralism, to enable young people the opportunity to study and do research through grants, and to work toward international understanding and cooperation.
The foundation employs several hundred employees in their offices in Bonn and Berlin, as well as in 14 regional offices and an academy within Germany and in over 100 foreign agencies. It is financed mainly through grants from the federal budget and the budgets of the various Bundesländer.
The FES had its own conference center on the Venusberg in Bonn for these activities until its closure in 2009.
The historical research center of the foundation also contains the Archive of Social Democracy and its libraries in Bonn and at the Karl Marx House in Trier. This is one of the largest collections of documents on social history and the history of the workers movement.
Since 1982, the foundation has awarded a prize of 10,000 euro called Das politische Buch ("The Political Book") to promote noteworthy political books. The prize serves to remind people of the Nazi book burnings of May 10, 1933.
Controversy
In 2017, Friedrich Ebert Foundation was attacked by a group dubbed “Pawn Storm”, the same cyber spy group that targeted that year's campaign of French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron; the group used email phishing tricks and attempted to install malware at the foundation.
In 2022, the Friedrich Ebert Foundation was barred from working in Russia.

Paul Reuter (1911-1990) was "one of the twentieth century's greatest specialists on international law" and the principal architect of the legal framework for the European Coal and Steel Community, the first in a series of institutions that would ultimately become the European Union.
Biography
Early years
Paul Reuter was born on 12 February 1911 in Metz, which at that time was part of the German Empire, but reverted to France at the end of World War I. They served in the French Forces during World War II.
Academic career
Reuter obtained the title of Agrégé de droit in 1928, and in 1933 was awarded their Doctor of Laws at the University of Nancy. They began their long teaching career at the University of Nancy in the mid-1930s and was later on the university law faculties of Poitiers, Aix-en-Provence, Paris, and the Graduate Institute for International Studies in Geneva.
Oxford University Press's Encyclopaedic Dictionary of International Law (EDIL) lists Reuter's principal works as:
- Droit International public (5th ed. 1976),
- Institutions internationals (8th ed. 1965),
- Institutions et relations internationals (2nd ed. 1988),
- Introduction au droit des traités (3rd ed. 1990).
Their book on the law of treaties (Introduction au droit des traités) is viewed as a "classic" work. This volume, and Reuter's book on international organizations (Institutions internationals) "are regarded as authoritative by academic and government circles alike." Further, Reuter's 1953 book on the European Coal and Steel Community (Communauté Européen du Charbon et de l'Acier) is the EDIL's recommended source on the institutions and structure of the European Community.
Government Advisor, and role in the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community
After the war, Reuter held senior positions in the French Ministries of Information, Justice, and National Defence, and they were a long-time adviser to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Reuter's input and expertise in international and public law was instrumental in the drafting of the Schuman Declaration and the Treaty of Paris (1951), which led to the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). The ECSC laid the foundation for the 1958 establishment of the European Economic Community, the forerunner of the European Union.
Judicial career
Reuter was a member of the International Law Commission of the United Nations from 1964 to 1989.
They represented France before the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the European Court of Human Rights.
As "one of the great international law minds of the world", Reuter was much in demand in international adjudications and arbitrations.
Honours and Awards
In 1981, Reuter was awarded the Balzan Prize for their work in International Public Law. The Balzan Prize is "one of the most prestigious international awards in natural science and humanities" and, in 2020, was worth 750,000 Swiss francs (about $800,000 US dollars.)
During 1985 and 1986, Reuter was President of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Institute of International Law (Institut de Droit International).
In 1986 Reuter received the World Academy of Art & Science Rufus Jones Award for Contributions to World Peace and International Understanding.
Death and legacy
Paul Reuter died on 29 April 1990 at the age of 79.
The construction of Europe owes much to Professor Reuter, according to Honorary President of the French Society for International Law, Alain Pellet. They believe "It was not exaggeration to say that, without him, the European Communities would not have appeared in their present form, or would have been established only much later."
Also, Reuter's contribution to the modern law of treaties and the law of international organizations will leave "indelible imprints on legal history" according to Bola Ajibola, speaking on behalf of the African country members of the UN's International Law Commission. Ajibola noted Reuter aspired to make international law "free from injustice and intended to serve the interest of both developed and developing counties, while protecting the weak from the strong."
A donation by Reuter in 1981 enabled the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to establish the Paul Reuter Prize to encourage research in, and the promotion of, international humanitarian law.

History
Early history
For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.
19th century
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.
The area was included in a treaty ceding land to the Osage Nation in 1808, and ceded back to the federal government in 1825. After 1825 and prior to 1867, treaties with various Indian nations set off parts of what was later to become Franklin County for their use.
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Franklin County was established. Franklin County was one of the 33 original Kansas Territory counties created by the first Territorial Legislature of 1855. The county was named after Benjamin Franklin.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.9%) is water.

The flathead chub (Platygobio gracilis) is a species of fish in the carp family, Cyprinidae. It is the only member of the monotypic genus Platygobio. It is native to North America, where it is distributed throughout central Canada and the central United States.
Distribution
This fish was first described from the Saskatchewan River in 1836. It is also known from three other major river systems in central North America, the Mackenzie, Missouri-Mississippi, and Rio Grande drainages. Its distribution extends from the Northwest Territories to Texas.
Biology
This is a minnow with an elongated body and a flat, "wedge-shaped" head. It has a pointed snout with a large mouth and barbels. It has sickle-shaped pectoral fins and a forked tail fin with pointed lobes. It has taste buds in its anal and pelvic fins. It has a slightly curving lateral line and large scales. The body of the adult may be brownish, olive, or black in color with a silvery wash across the sides and belly. The adult is generally 9 to 18 centimeters in length but can reach 26 centimeters. The male and female are similar in appearance.
This fish lives in rivers and large tributaries, often in fast-moving, turbid waters. The species may congregate in groups but moves independently rather than schooling. Spawning behaviors are not well known in this species. Feeding behaviors have not been observed often but the fish is thought to be mostly insectivorous.

The 2/3rd Commando Squadron was one of twelve independent or commando companies and squadrons formed by the Australian Army for service during World War II. Raised in October 1941 as the 2/3rd Independent Company, it served in New Caledonia and New Guinea before being amalgamated into the 2/7th Cavalry Commando Regiment and adopting the name 2/3rd Commando Squadron in 1943. After this, the squadron did not see action again until 1945, when it participated in the Borneo campaign. Throughout the course of the war, the 2/3rd lost 69 members killed in action. No battle honours were awarded to the unit, although it participated in a number of notable engagements in these campaigns and its members received numerous decorations for their service. Following the end of hostilities in the Pacific, the unit was disbanded in early 1946, upon their return to Australia.
History
Formed in October 1941 as the 2/3rd Independent Company, the unit undertook training at the Guerrilla Warfare Camp at Foster, Victoria. After completing training, the 2/3rd was transported north to Katherine, Northern Territory, where it carried out various garrison duties. During this time there was considerable debate within the high command of the Australian Army about the role that the 2/3rd and the other independent companies would fill. However, following Japan's entry into World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor and British forces in Malaya, it was decided to use the independent companies in the islands to the north of Australia, where it was necessary to establish outposts that could warn of the approach of the Japanese. With this in mind, the 2/3rd Independent Company was sent to New Caledonia in December 1941 as a gesture of goodwill to the Free French and in order to defend against a possible Japanese attack.
The deployment of the 2/3rd to New Caledonia was only a temporary measure, however, until the US Army sent Taskforce 6814 to reinforce the island, arriving in March 1942. Impressed with the 2/3rd and the training methods that they utilised, permission was sought by the American commander to retain the 2/3rd on the island in order to retrain their division. However, due to the requirements of the defence of Australia at the time, the company was withdrawn in early August 1942, although their commanding officer, Major George Matheson, stayed on to provide assistance and was promoted to lieutenant colonel.
After its return to Australia, the company spent the next six months training and undertaking garrison duties before sailing for New Guinea in mid-February 1943. Under the command of Major George Warfe, the 2/3rd arrived in Port Moresby, although they did not stay there very long as they were quickly flown to Wau. From there they were used to harassing and pursue the Japanese towards Mubo. Following this, the 2/3rd moved to Missim, from where they began a guerilla campaign along the Komiatum Track, in support of the 3rd Division's campaign around Salamaua.
As a part of this campaign, the 2/3rd patrolled deep into Japanese held territory, setting ambushes and gathering intelligence. They also made a number of attacks against Japanese positions, in order to harass them to keep them off balance and as such defend the 3rd Division's flanks. The most notable of these attacks came in May 1943 when a strengthened platoon launched an attack against Ambush Knoll, a feature which controlled Bobdubi Ridge, and captured it. By capturing the knoll, the 2/3rd threatened the Japanese supply lines to Mubo and Salamaua and because of this it forced them to launch a number of fierce counterattacks in an attempt to retake it. These counterattacks occurred over the course of the following three days and four nights, however, the platoon from the 2/3rd, consisting of only fifty-two men, managed to hold the knoll.
During its time in New Guinea, the 2/3rd suffered heavy casualties and as a result after the fall of Salamaua in September, they were withdrawn and brought back to Australia. They had performed quite well in the circumstances, however, and were credited with having killed 969 Japanese. Against this, the 2/3rd had suffered 65 killed, 119 wounded, and 226 men evacuated for medical reasons.
Upon its return to Australia, the 2/3rd was reformed on the Atherton Tablelands, Queensland. During this time, a reorganisation of the independent companies by the Australian Army was undertaken as part of a wider reorganisation of the Army as a whole and as a part of this reorganisation the 2/3rd was integrated into the 2/7th Cavalry Commando Regiment, along with the 2/5th and the 2/6th Independent Companies. In October, the 2/3rd Independent Company was renamed the 2/3rd Cavalry Commando Squadron, although later this name was simplified to just 2/3rd Commando Squadron. To a large extent, however, despite being placed under a regimental structure, the squadron continued to remain largely independent in terms of tactics and training.
For the remainder of 1943 until early 1945 there was a lull Australia's involvement in the war in the Pacific, and the 2/3rd remained on the Atherton Tablelands, where it trained and conducted exercises with the 7th Division. The squadron's final campaign of the war came in 1945, when attached to the 7th Division, the 2/3rd participated in the landing at Balikpapan. Landing on Green Beach on 1 July 1945 along with the rest of 2/7th Cavalry (Commando) Regiment, the squadron moved off along Vasey Highway with the objective of capturing Seppinggang airfield, acting in support of the 2/5th Commando Squadron. The following day, however, they came under heavy mortar fire from the Japanese on Lady Schofield Knoll which prevented them from capturing the airfield until 3 July. After that, on 4 July, a number of troops were transferred to the 2/9th Infantry Battalion in order to patrol the area around Penadjam, with the rest of the 2/3rd continuing on to Seppinggang. Offensive operations ceased on 27 July, and with Japan's surrender in August, the war came to a close.
Following the end of hostilities in the Pacific, the 2/3rd was slowly reduced in strength as members were posted out to other units for occupation duties, before the remainder of the unit returned to Australia at the end of December. In early 1946, at Chermside camp, in Brisbane, Queensland, the 2/3rd Commando Squadron was finally disbanded. A total of 69 members of the squadron were killed or died on active service during the war, and its members received the following decorations: four Military Crosses, four Distinguished Conduct Medals, six Military Medals, one British Empire Medal and four Mentions in Despatches.

Osmund Lindgaard Brønnum (23 March 1907 – 3 March 1944) was a Norwegian sports official and communist resistance member.
They were born in Sandar outside of Sandefjord as a son of Nils Olsen and Hilda Larsen; both from Sandar. After their father's death in 1908, their mother Hilda lost the small farm and moved with the kids to Oslo, then named Kristiania, in order to find work.
From 1929 to 1932 they were enrolled at the KUNMZ University in Moscow, Russia. On their return they were elected leader of the NKU, The Young Communist League, the youth wing of the NKP, the Communist Party of Norway. In 1937 they married Dagny, a woman from Drammen. They were employed as a functionary for the municipal sports fields of Oslo. They were active in the trade union Friområdenes Fagforening, a member body of the Union of Municipal Employees. As a boxer, they represented the sports club Vika IF, and was a part of the leadership in the Workers' Confederation of Sports. In 1939 they supported the merger between the workers' and bourgeois sports organizations, in order to create a unity front against fascism.
During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, Brønnum participated in the Norwegian resistance movement in various ways. They worked in the illegal press, and also joined the military organization Milorg, founding its East End branch of District 13. They were also a central committee member of the Communist Party of Norway, which was banned from August 1940. They were arrested by the Nazis for the first time on 3 October 1940, and was incarcerated in Møllergata 19 until 4 December 1940. In April 1943 they had to flee the country for neutral Sweden, but this was discovered by a denouncer, and Brønnum was held up at Skotterud, not far from the Swedish border. Before their second arrest, they briefly held the title as military leader of the Communist Party resistance.
Arrested on 8 April 1943, they were held in Møllergata 19 to 4 May 1943, then in Grini detention camp to 2 March 1944. They were then transferred to Trandum. They had been sentenced to death in November 1943, by a court-martial (a SS- und Polizeigericht) led by Hans Paul Latza. They were executed at Trandumskogen on 3 March 1944 together with six other men, including biologist Iacob Dybwad Sømme. Brønnum is buried at Nordre gravlund, at the memorial to the 20 members of the Communist Central Committee who were killed by the Nazis during the occupation.

Helen Boehm (December 26, 1920 – November 15, 2010) was an American business person who played a pivotal role in promoting the ceramic sculptures created by their husband, Edward Marshall Boehm, earning them the nickname the "Princess of Porcelain". A luncheon invitation from First Lady Mamie Eisenhower helped make Boehm's designs a standard gift from U.S. Presidents to foreign dignitaries.
They were born as Elena Francesca Stephanie Franzolin in 1920 to immigrants from Genoa, Italy, and was raised in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. They began working as a teenager following the death of their father, later studying to become an optician. After they qualified for grinding and fitting prescription glasses, they landed a job with Manhattan's leading optical firm, E.B. Myerowitz.
They married Edward Marshall Boehm, a veterinary assistant who raised livestock and created sculptures of animals in their spare time, in 1944. Helen Boehm borrowed money from one of their customers and used the funds to help their husband devote their time to their art at what was originally called E.M. Boehm Studios, located in the basement of their home in Trenton, New Jersey, founded in 1950. Their breakthrough came in 1951, when the Curator of the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York purchased two statues for the museum's collection. Helen took on the promotional and marketing side of the business, selling pieces to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and offering a porcelain bull to Mamie Eisenhower after wrangling an invitation to the White House.
After the sudden death of their husband, aged 55, in 1969, Helen took over operation of the company and maintained the "Edward Marshall Boehm" logo. There is a lack of copyright differentiation between the works produced during Edward Marshall Boehm's lifetime, 1951–1969 and the works done after their death by the Boehm firm. In 1969 Helen directed the creation of The Bird of Peace, later gifted to China during Nixon's historic 1972 visit to the country. The firms' artisans created a porcelain copy of the wedding bouquet of Diana, Princess of Wales and crafted a white rose in their memory following their death. Sculptures the firm produced after the death of Edward Boehm are owned by individuals including Queen Elizabeth II, Mikhail Gorbachev and Pope John Paul II at times reportedly range in value from hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars. They sold the concern in 2003.
Them autobiography With a Little Luck: An American Odyssey was published in 1985. A resident of Trump Plaza in West Palm Beach, Florida, Helen Boehm died on November 15, 2010, at their home from complications of cancer and Parkinson's disease. They were 89 years old. They had no immediate survivors, though they and their husband had raised their nieces at an earlier time.

Auto-Saharan Companies (in Italian Compagnie Auto-Avio Sahariane (sometimes referred to as "La Compagnia") were special Italian units of desert warfare operating in Libya and Sahara desert during Second World War. Their military operations took place in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, until the surrender of Italo-German forces in May 1943.
History
The Compagnie were instituted in the late 1930s, after a conversion of dromedary mounted troops called Meharisti, with the task to conduct long range patrols in the desert. These units were formed with mixed Italian and Libyan personnel.
During the North African Campaign these units were tasked to conduct reconnaissance, often in contrast to similar British units like LRDG.
The number of active companies varied from three and five during the war, and each company was equipped with 20 to 30 vehicles and three Caproni Ca.309 "Ghibli" light aircraft for reconnaissance.
In 1940, at the beginning of the war, these companies were part of the Maletti Group but located at the Kufra Oasis. In that part of Italian Libya, a clash took place with British forces at the end of January 1941 at Jebel Sharif.
In this victorious skirmish that took place in the Jebel Sherif valley, British members of the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) suffered one man killed and two taken prisoners, included Major Clayton, and the loss of three desert vehicles. The Italians suffered three killed and three injured. The remaining four British soldiers fled through the Libyan desert to the Nile. Major Clayton was conferred a Distinguished Service Order.
The Compagnie Auto-avio sahariane continued their confrontations with the LRDG in 1941 and 1942, and a raid in Egypt was accomplished under guide of commander Del Pozzo.
At the end of North Africa campaign, in 1943, the surviving vehicles of different companies were reorganized in the Saharian Group ("Raggruppamento Sahariano") of Mannerini (also known as "Gruppo Mannerini"), and used for patrol duties in Tunisia, but they also took part in some skirmishes in the Mareth area (Operation Pugilist), until the final surrender of Axis forces in Africa.
Equipment
Companies were formed around expert soldiers (called "Arditi Camionettisti"), riding AB 41 armored cars and FIAT and Lancia light trucks customized to operate in the desert; heavily armed with heavy machine guns, light 47 mm and 65 mm guns, and AA 20 mm Breda 35 guns.
The light trucks used by these companies include:
FIAT-SPA AS37
FIAT-SPA AS43
SPA-Viberti AS42
FIAT 634

A recast is a technique used in language teaching to correct learners' errors in such a way that communication is not obstructed. To recast an error, an interlocutor will repeat the error back to the learner in a corrected form. Recasts are used both by teachers in formal educational settings, and by interlocutors in naturalistic language acquisition.
Child language acquisition
Recasts can be used by adults to improve children's native language skills. A frequently used technique is for the adult to imitate the child's speech. In this form of recast, the adult repeats the child's incorrect phrases in correct form. This enables the child to learn the correct pronunciation, grammar and sentence structure.
Language education
Recasts can be used for teaching second languages. Sometimes, the teacher will repeat the words back to the student, usually with different intonation or form, or as a question, so that the recasting appears as a continuation of the conversation:
For example, in German:
Student: "Ich möchte haben ein Stift."
Teacher: "Du möchtest einen Stift haben?"
Here, the teacher has corrected the student's incorrect positioning of the infinitive "haben" and their declension of the indefinite article "ein".
In this form the recast is usually more than a simple repeating of the learner's words. The teacher will correct the student's errors but also extend the learning by adding additional words or phrases.
A further example, in English:
Student: "I want eat."
Teacher: "What do you want to eat?"
In this example the teacher is making the correction to the student's speech (adding a "to") but also extending the learning by asking a question.
Efficacy
Some researchers into second language learning have challenged the degree of effectiveness of recasts drawing attention to the abilities of the learner and the limitations imposed by the learner only being able to repeat the words of the teacher as factors that have not been accounted for by proponents of the method.

Letters of Administration are granted by a Surrogate Court or probate registry to appoint appropriate people to deal with a deceased person's estate where property will pass under Intestacy Rules or where there are no executors living (and willing and able to act) having been validly appointed under the deceased's will. Traditionally, letters of administration granted to a representative of a testator's estate are called "letters of administration with the will annexed" or "letters of administration cum testamento annexo" or "c.t.a.".
Essentially, this document is issued to the person who will administer the estate of someone who dies without a will. As outlined by the Cornell Legal Information Institute, "The letters authorize the administrator to settle the deceased person's estate according to the state's intestate succession laws. Banks, brokerages, and government agencies often require a certified copy of the letters before accepting the administrator's authority to collect the deceased person's assets." If a deceased has a surviving spouse, this individual will have priority in receiving a letter of administration over others, including children; age alone does not render an individual ineligible to serve as a fiduciary.

Loud Like Love is the seventh studio album by British alternative rock band Placebo, recorded between 2012 and 2013 and released on 16 September 2013.
The album reached number 13 in the UK Albums Chart, and received a mixed response from critics. Three singles were released from the album: "Too Many Friends", "Loud Like Love" and "A Million Little Pieces". It is the band's final album to feature the drummer Steve Forrest.
Background
During the Battle for the Sun tour, band members Brian Molko and Stefan Olsdal both stated on various occasions that they were working on material for the next studio album. In November 2011, the band announced via their Facebook page and official website that they will be returning to the studio in 2012 to record their seventh studio album.
Recording
Molko was originally working on material for a possible solo release, and they wrote various songs for it that would later appear on Loud Like Love. The band went in the recording studio to record some singles, but then they began to record more and more material.
The album was recorded in London's RAK Studios, where Placebo had also recorded their fifth studio album, Meds. Production duties, as well as mixing, were handled by Adam Noble.
Composition
The album revolves around the theme of love, in all different forms: romance, happiness and also heartbreak. "Too Many Friends" deals with people spending time on the internet and end up being far more close to the hundreds of friends on the internet than off the computer. "Rob the Bank" is about somebody loving you unconditionally, even if you, in this case, rob a bank.
Release
The album was announced on 21 May 2013 through the band's official website. Loud Like Love's track listing and its first single, "Too Many Friends", were officially announced on 17 June 2013.
The album's lead single, "Too Many Friends", was released on 8 July 2013. The music video, written and directed by Saman Kesh, was filmed in Los Angeles, and features the first collaboration between Placebo and American novelist Bret Easton Ellis. Another song premiered from the album is the track "Loud Like Love", which was released as a digital download on 6 August 2013 and as a single on 18 March 2014.
The album was released worldwide on 16 September 2013. The release formats include a box set, a deluxe CD digipack with the DVD "Live at RAK Studios", a CD and a 12" vinyl. On the day of Loud Like Love'''s release, an internet show titled "LLLTV" was streamed live from YouTube Studios in London. It was the first YouTube live stream of its kind. The show featured, among other things, Placebo performing songs from the album and older songs (chosen in part by the audience through an online poll), band interviews and guest appearances by people who collaborated with Placebo on the making of the album.
The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 13, the first time Placebo have missed the UK Top Ten in ten years (since Sleeping With Ghosts) and their lowest UK album position ever. The album also entered the French Albums Chart at number 3, the first time they missed the French number one spot since Without You I'm Nothing fifteen years earlier. The album charted in the Australian Albums Chart at number 9 and at number 18 in the Irish Albums Chart. Loud Like Love is also the first Placebo album to miss the Portuguese Top Five, peaking at number 15. The album entered the US Billboard chart at number 98, where the previous one, Battle For The Sun, reached number 51. The album did peak at number 1 in Switzerland, Placebo's third album in a row to do so. This currently is the album's only number 1 peak.
Reception
"Loud Like Love" was met with generally mixed reviews from music critics. The album holds an approval rating of 55/100 at Metacritic, which indicates a mixed or average reception.Alternative Press' Mischa Pearlman wrote that "too much of this album comes off like self-parody, meaning it's a far cry from the pulverizing power of their best work". AllMusic wrote that "many of these songs play like less-alienated, if no less paranoid, OK Computer-era Radiohead cuts", adding that "however, the songs here are still laden with Molko's high-pitched vocals, which they characteristically use to play the eternally angst-ridden and alienated teenager -- something the band's fans will surely appreciate", giving the album 3.5 stars out of 5. Amanda Arber of Clash said that Loud Like Love is "easy to absorb musically and easy to ignore lyrically" and "50 minutes of simply okay alt-rock." The Guardian gave the album two stars out of five, saying "the veteran band sticks to what it knows for Loud Like Love''."

William Dummer Powell (November 5, 1755 - September 6, 1834) was a Loyalist lawyer, judge and political figure in Upper Canada.
Early life and education
Born at Boston, Massachusetts, they were named for their grandmother's brother William Dummer, Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts. They were the eldest son of John Powell (1716-1794), a prosperous merchant who for thirty years held the contract for provisioning the Royal Navy before fleeing to England after the revolution. Their mother, Janet (1728-1795), was the daughter of Sweton (or Suetonius) Grant (1702-1744), of Newport, Rhode Island. Grant was a member of the Grant Baronets of Dalvey and Gartenbeg, who was probably involved in the slave trade and started a gunpowder business in Boston. Ironically, Grant was killed by an explosion.
Powell studied in Boston before being sent to England under the care of their maternal relative, Sir Alexander Grant, who sent them to board at Tonbridge School. Having in four years excelled at nothing other than cricket, they were next sent them to live with a merchant at Rotterdam where they were to learn French and Dutch while gaining a first-hand experience in business. Having returned to Boston in 1772, two years later they started their legal career in the offices of Jonathan Sewell, Attorney General of Massachusetts. After their marriage, they returned to England in 1775 where they studied law at the Middle Temple.
Career
As a Loyalist, Powell went to Quebec in 1779, entering private practice in Montreal. In 1783, they went to England to petition with other delegates against the Quebec Act. Their formal call to the English bar, delayed because of finances, was finally arranged in 1784 and, later that year, they returned to Boston to attempt to recover their father's property which had been confiscated after the American Revolution. Unsuccessful, they returned to Montreal in 1785.
In 1789, they were appointed judge in the Western District. They lived in Detroit but the court sat at L'Assomption (Windsor). In 1794, they were appointed to the Court of King's Bench for Upper Canada and moved to Newark (Niagara-on-the-Lake). In 1808, they were appointed to the Executive Council for the province. They settled at York (Toronto) and remained there during the American occupation during the War of 1812. They opposed the suspension of habeas corpus during the war. In 1814, they assisted Chief Justice Thomas Scott by presiding over several of the trials known as the "Bloody Assize" which were held at Ancaster to prosecute those charged with treason during the war.
When Chief Justice Thomas Scott was no longer able to chair the Executive Council in 1816, Powell took on that post, and also replaced them as Chief Justice later that same year.
They upset the province's administration by rejecting many of the charges brought by Lord Selkirk against those who had stirred up trouble for the Red River Colony. In 1823, they refused to swear in Alexander Wood as a commissioner for war claims arising from the War of 1812; Powell had originally opposed their appointment on moral grounds. Wood successfully sued them for damages. Although they opposed prosecuting Robert Fleming Gourlay for attacks on the administration of the province, they found themselves forced to banish Gourlay from the province for sedition. In 1825, after they were rebuked by the Executive Council for exposing the administration to criticism, they resigned from that council; they were succeeded by William Campbell as Chief Justice later that year. They died in Toronto in 1834.
Family
In 1775, Powell married Anne Murray, daughter of Dr John Murray (b.1720) and Mary Boyles. John Murray was born in Scotland and became a surgeon in the Royal Navy. They established themselves with a private medical practice at Wells and then Norwich, before moving to Boston.
They were survived by two children. Their son, Captain John Powell of Brockamour Manor, Niagara-on-the-Lake, married a daughter of General Æneas Shaw and they were the parents of John Powell, alderman and mayor of Toronto.
Justice William Powell was described as a dedicated family man, sitting in the middle of their family in their pew at church. Their daughter died in 1822 when a boat they were on sank. The packet ship, the Albion, was one of the finest class of ships that operated between Liverpool and New York. They were scheduled to come to York on the previous voyage, but missed it for an unknown reason.
Legacy
Powell sold the north half of their Park Lot 12 to provide land for King's College (now the University of Toronto).

Darbar Sahib Worship takes place in the Diwan Hall (prayer hall). In the Diwan Hall, there are people playing worship hymns from the Guru Granth Sahib. The Guru Granth Sahib is the highest spiritual authority in Sikhism and is to be treated as though it is a living Guru. People visiting the Gurdwara sit on the floor often cross-legged, as pointing your feet towards an object or person, in this case, the Guru Granth Sahib Ji, may be mistaken as disrespectful according to cultural norms. It is also the traditional and optimal posture for deep meditation. Furthermore, sitting on the floor is seen as a symbol of equality among all people. Rather than some people standing, some people sitting on chairs and some people sitting on the floor, everybody sits on the floor to show that nobody is higher in status than anybody else.
Traditionally, women and children, and men sit on opposite sides of the diwan hall. However, seating in a mixed pattern is in no way prohibited.
The Guru Granth Sahib is placed on pillows, which have beautiful cloths draped over them, which are on a raised platform that has a canopy. The cloths, called romallas, cover the Guru Granth Sahib when it is not being read.
This is at the front of the diwan hall. Also in the diwan hall, there is another platform where musicians (called the Ragis) sit and play their instruments while the congregation are singing hymns. Music is an important part of Sikh worship because it helps when people are singing hymns that are written in the Guru Granth Sahib. The hymns that are written in the Guru Granth Sahib are called Gurbani, which means: The words of the guru.

St Joseph's Convent is a heritage-listed former convent and chapel at 232 Lane Street, Broken Hill, City of Broken Hill, New South Wales, Australia. It is also known as Mount St Joseph's Convent of Mercy. It was designed by E. J. Woods and built from 1891. The property is owned by Broken Hill Church of Christ Inc. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.
History
Six sisters of the Sisters of Mercy had come to Broken Hill from Singleton in 1890 after the Bishop of Wilcannia, John Dunne, asked the sisters there to send a community to Broken Hill "for the welfare of the children". The sisters initially resided in a "very modest cottage" at the side of the present building, later removed.
The foundation stone for St Joseph's Convent was laid by Bishop Dunne in February 1891. Adelaide architect E. J. Woods designed the building, and local contractor Mr. Kelly was responsible for construction of the initial west wing. The first stage of the current building officially opened on 19 July 1891, although it was originally viewed as the "new wing" in conjunction with the original cottage, with further development planned as the growth of the town warranted it. The building would subsequently be completed in three separate contracts, the last 1907–08, with the original cottage demolished to make way for newer buildings in the 1950s to house the music rooms and Nun's Infirmary. The total cost of construction amounted to "just on £16,000".
The first floor was destroyed by fire in 1979. Following the fire, the Sisters of Mercy decided to sell the property and relocate the remaining nuns to the former Franciscan Friary in Murton Street, North Broken Hill.
It was purchased by a group of local property developers after the fire, who had plans to convert the complex into a private hospital. The heritage listing precluded external modification of the appearance of the listed buildings, so the plans fell through. The property was offered for sale again and in 1982, the Broken Hill Church of Christ purchased and subsequently refurbished the complex. The church used the former schoolrooms as a chapel for religious services and adapted the Convent as unit accommodation.
On 9 May 2019, the Broken Hill Church of Christ sold the property at auction to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilcannia-Forbes, who took possession on 11 July 2019.

Admiral Percival Henry Hall-Thompson (5 May 1874 – 6 July 1950) was a Royal Navy officer who played a key role in the development of the New Zealand Naval Forces and also served in the First World War as commander of . They went on to be First Naval Member and Chief of the Australian Naval Staff.
Early life
Hall-Thompson was born Percival Henry Hall Thompson, the son of Henry Hall Thompson and their wife, Agnes Spooner, on 5 May 1874 in Eling, Hampshire. Educated at a private school, they joined the Royal Navy in 1887 as a midshipman. They were posted to the training ship HMS Britannia as a cadet.
Naval career
Hall Thompson served in a series of overseas postings, including a period in Australia as Inspector of War-like Stores at Garden Island, but by 1905 was based in London. They were promoted to post-captain in June 1913.
In 1913, through the passage of the Naval Defence Act 1913, the New Zealand government formed the New Zealand Naval Forces. This was in response to the desire of the New Zealand Minister of Defence at the time, James Allen, who wanted to establish a local naval force which would co-operate with the fledgling Royal Australian Navy. An approach was made to the British Admiralty for assistance and Hall-Thompson, who had hyphenated their name after their marriage to Helen Sidney Deacon in 1899, was accordingly appointed naval advisor to New Zealand. They commenced a three-year term on 1 May 1914, which also included command of , a , loaned to New Zealand as a seagoing training cruiser. They arrived in New Zealand with their family on 24 June 1914 and settled in Wellington to begin implementing a training program for New Zealand cadets. They took Philomel on its first cruise in New Zealand service at the end of the following month but was almost immediately recalled to Wellington when it became apparent that war was to break out in Europe.
First World War
After Philomel was hastily refitted for war service, Hall-Thompson took them into the South Pacific as an escort to the Samoan Expeditionary Force that captured German Samoa in September 1914. They then escorted the main body of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) to Australia where it joined a convoy of troopships carrying men of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) destined for Egypt. Philomel continued with the convoy as an escort and once it reached the Middle East, was detached for operations in the Persian Gulf.
By 1917, Philomel was worn out and returned to New Zealand. Despite their own desire to continue on operational service, Hall-Thompson's active participation in the war ended. Now back in New Zealand, they continued to advise the government on the development of the country's naval service. Late in 1917, the German raider ship laid mines in New Zealand waters. Initially considering it implausible that a minefield was responsible for sunk shipping, Hall-Thompson organised the minesweeping operations of 1918 to clear them. For their services during the war, they were made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George and awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, 3rd Class, by Emperor Taishō of Japan.
Postwar period
In 1919, much to their disappointment as they enjoyed living in New Zealand, Hall-Thompson was recalled to England. The New Zealand defence minister at the time, James Allen, was also disappointed as they had established a good working relationship with Hall-Thompson.
In 1920 Hall-Thompson was given command of the battleship and two years later became Aide-de-Camp to the King. They contributed a chapter to a volume of the Official History of New Zealand's Effort in the Great War, writing about the work of Philomel and this was published in 1923. They were appointed First Naval Member & Chief of the Australian Naval Staff with effect from January 1924 and later that year was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. They completed their term with the Australian Navy in 1926 and went on to command the 3rd Battle Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet from 1927 to 1928. They then led the Reserve Fleet for two years.
Later life
Hall-Thompson retired in 1932 with the rank of admiral. They lived in Kent until they died on 6 July 1950, survived by their wife and four children. A son, Derrick, was also a career officer in the Royal Navy and ended their career as a rear admiral. A daughter, Mary (later Mary Austin), was awarded the DBE for community service in Australia.

Mendiola Consortium (MC) is an educational organization of five institutions located along the street of Mendiola in Manila, Philippines. It was founded on July 16, 1974, upon the invitation of then Centro Escolar University President Dionisio Tiongco to the heads of San Beda University, College of the Holy Spirit and La Consolacion College Manila.
They agreed to unite their resources to enhance the capability of providing quality education and public service, and to participate more effectively in the attainment of national development. It is through the MC schools that Mendiola street have become a peace zone since it was traditionally a site of rallies because of its proximity to Malacañan Palace.

The Leyden manuscript (Dornskrid Leiden) is the name usually given in Breton studies to a four-page leaflet ("bifolio") kept in the library of Leiden University in the Netherlands (shelfmark: folio 96 A). It is a fragment of a Latin medical treatise dating from the 9th or late 8th century in which two Irish words appear and about thirty Old Breton words.
Description
Pierre-Yves Lambert thus describes the place held by Breton in this text:
Vossianus lat. 96 A has the peculiarity of including Old Breton not in the glosses, but in the main text: it is one of the few documents where the vernacular language is not restricted to secondary use. Nevertheless, Old Breton only intervenes on one page of this bifolio and there it remains subordinate to Latin insofar as it is simply technical words (names of plants, preparations) which are substituted for the corresponding Latin words.
From a literary point of view, they add:
Leiden's medical fragment is doubtless not typically Breton in the subject: it is a question of ancient or medieval Latin recipes that are constantly being copied in monasteries.
Some examples of the Breton words found in the manuscript:
: apple
: branch
: search
: holly
: oak
: alder tree
: mistletoe
: head
: elder tree
: thorn (hawthorn, plum tree)

Solar power in Florida has been increasing, as the cost of solar power systems using photovoltaics (PV) has decreased in recent years.
Florida has low electricity costs compared with other states, which makes individual solar investment less attractive.
Florida ranks ninth nationally in solar resource strength according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and tenth in solar generation by the Solar Energy Industries Association.
Government support
In 2006, the State of Florida enacted the Florida Renewable Energy Technologies and Energy Efficiency Act, which provided consumers with rebates and tax credits for solar photovoltaic systems.
The program was closed in 2010.
Later, the Florida Public Service Commission mandated that the state's large utilities offer individual solar rebates.
The program opened in 2011 and was closed in 2015 after the Commission deemed it to not be cost-effective for non-solar customers.
In 2008, Florida adopted a net metering rule that allows any electric utility customer generating up to 2 MW (2,000 kW) of power to use net metering, which provides a retail rate credit for kilowatt-hours of electricity delivered to the utility, rolled over from month to month, and paid out in cash by the utility once a year at the avoided cost rate.
The federal Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit (income tax credit on IRS Form 5695) for residential PV and solar thermal was extended in December 2015 to remain at 30% of system cost (parts and installation) for systems put into service by the end of 2019, then 26% until the end of 2020, and then 22% until the end of 2021. It applies to a taxpayer's principal and/or second residences, but not to a property that is rented out. There is no maximum cap on the credit, and the credit can be applied toward the Alternative Minimum Tax, and any excess credit (greater than that year's tax liability) can be rolled into the following year.
Large-scale facilities
In 2009, Florida Power & Light built the state's first solar power plant, the FPL DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center.
At the time, the 25-MW plant was the largest of its kind.
In 2010, FPL built the world's first hybrid solar-natural gas energy center.
The state's largest solar plant is the 75 MW FPL Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center, in Martin County operated by Florida Power and Light.
It was the world's first hybrid solar-natural gas energy center and is a concentrated solar power (CSP) plant using solar thermal instead of photovoltaic technology.
No additional CSP plants are under development in Florida, although in 2007 a 300 MW fresnel CSP plant had been planned.
The state's largest photovoltaic plant is the 25 MW DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center, operated by Florida Power and Light, completed in 2009. Florida Power and Light also operates the Space Coast Next Generation Solar Energy Center, a 10 MW photovoltaic facility near the Kennedy Space Center.
The 100 MW Sorrento Solar Farm was expected to become Florida's largest photovoltaic solar farm with 40 MW of photovoltaic capacity already under construction in Lake County. However the company Blue Chip Energy became insolvent and the equipment and farm site was sold at a public auction in 2013.
Florida Power and Light announced in October 2014 that it would build three more power plants by the end of 2016. The FPL Manatee Solar Energy Center is located in Manatee County at a natural gas power plant, FPL Citris Solar Energy Center is in DeSoto County, near the FPL DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center, and FPL Babcock Ranch Solar Energy Center is in Charlotte County. The three plants together generate 225 MW, approximately the same as the total solar power installed in the entire state at the time.
Tampa Electric Company is building a 2 MW farm at the Tampa International Airport. Gulf Power Company and the U.S. military announced contracts for the construction of 3 large plants in Florida: a 50 MW project at Saufley Field in Pensacola, a 40 MW project being at Holley Field in Navarre, and a 30 MW project at Eglin Air Force Base.
In April 2015, Duke Energy Florida proposed to build 500MW of solar in the next ten years.
Set to go live on January 1, 2018, the 20-megawatt Tallahassee Solar Farm is still currently under construction on 120 acres of the property of Tallahassee International Airport (TLH). Even though it has reached capacity a second solar farm is being planned for the city.
Duke Energy and Walt Disney World built a five-megawatt solar farm near Epcot Center which has been called the Walt Disney World Solar Facility, or 'Hidden Mickey'. It is visible from the air as a giant Mickey Mouse shape. It sells power to Walt Disney World. Disney World will soon be adding a new solar farm ten times larger than the Hidden Mickey farm. Reedy Creek Improvement District and Origis Energy are in agreement to build the farm on the western edge of Disney's property. It will provide renewable solar power to the Reedy Creek Improvement District and to Disney World.
In April 2018, a new Florida town just north of Fort Myers called Babcock Ranch, began attempting to become fully solar-powered. Florida Power and Light partnered with town founders to build a 75-megawatt solar-generating facility that's already running. The land was purchased in 2006 and more than 90% is being preserved for wildlife. The town's developers hope its success will keep the federal government from imposing high tariffs on solar energy, and keep the energy source in private hands. Babcock Ranch developer Syd Kitson has said that Florida has done a good job of embracing solar energy.
Tampa Electric currently has a plan to build a 350-acre solar farm in rural Pasco County which is being challenged by neighbors who oppose the project for visual aesthetic reasons. A county ordinance has been proposed restricting where solar farms can be located in the future.
Solar panels
Developers in Florida have announced the addition of solar panels on all new homes in several subdivisions.
In 2013, it was discovered that Blue Chip Energy was selling fraudulent solar panels to hundreds of consumers throughout Florida.
Statistics
Potential generation
Solar energy is the state's most abundant energy resource and estimates have placed the state's potential at 2,902 GW, which would produce about 5,274,479 GWh, an amount much larger than the state and countries's total electricity consumption of 231,210 GWh and 4,125,060 GWh in 2010. Florida is one of only two states with no potential for conventional wind power, the other being Mississippi, and will need to either import energy from other states during overcast days and at night, or provide adequate grid energy storage. Most of the potential is from photovoltaics, which provides no storage. The state has some potential for concentrated solar power, but the potential is estimated at 0.13 GW. Taller, 140 meter hub height wind turbines allow up to 153 GW of wind turbines in Florida.

That Luang is the national symbol and most important religious monument of Laos. Vientiane's most important Theravada Buddhist festival, "Boun That Luang", is held here for three days during
the full moon of the twelfth lunar month (November).
The monument
The That Luang dates from 1566. It has been destroyed and ransacked and renovated numerous times. The site is sacred as the Lao believe that the stupa enshrines a relict of Buddha.
Festivities
Monks and laypeople from all over Laos congregate to celebrate the occasion with three days of religious ceremony followed by a week of festivities, day and night. The procession of laypeople begins at Wat Si Muang in the city center and proceeds to That Luang to make offerings to the monks in order to accumulate merit for rebirth into a better life. The religious part concludes as laypeople, carrying incense and candles as offerings, circulate That Luang three times in honor of Buddha. Folk and popular music troupes and drama performances provide entertainment at the festival.

Jinsa of Baekje (?–392, 385–392) was the sixteenth king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.
Life
They were the younger brother of the previous ruler, King Chimnyu. According to the Samguk Sagi, they ascended to the throne because the heir, later King Asin, was too young. However, according to the Japanese Nihon Shoki they usurped the throne by force.
They ordered numerous attacks against Goguryeo, which was expanding into Baekje territory from the north. In the year 386, they commanded all men living in Cheongmongnyeong (靑木嶺,present-day Kaesong), above the age of fifteen, to move north and west to defend the borders. They sent the noble Jin Gamo to attack the Goguryeo Dogon Castle, which was conquered. However, in 392 King Gwanggaeto of Goguryeo counterattacked and seized most of the Baekje territory north of the Han River. In the tenth month of that year, Goguryeo troops took Gwanmi Castle and threatened the Baekje palace.
According to the Samguk Sagi, Jinsa died while hunting at a satellite palace in Guwon. According to the Nihon Shoki, Japanese diplomats were sent to Baekje to condemn Jinsa for disrespecting the Japanese emperor, and Jinsa was executed by Baekje as an apology. The Japanese diplomats then put Asin in power and returned to Japan.

Rache , also spelled racch, rach, and ratch, from Old English ræcc, linked to Old Norse rakkí, is an obsolete name for a type of hunting dog used in Great Britain in the Middle Ages. It was a scenthound used in a pack to run down and kill game, or bring it to bay. The word appears before the Norman Conquest. It was sometimes confused with 'brache', (also 'bratchet') which is a French derived word for a female scenthound.
In medieval hunting in England and Northern Europe, pursuit of the hart or wild boar involved using a 'limer' or 'lyam hound' (a hound handled on a leash or 'lyam') to trace the animal from its footprints or droppings to where it was browsing or lying up. This became known as 'harbouring' the animal. When this had been done, the huntsman reported back to their lord, who then brought the pack of raches to chase it down on its hot scent when it had been unharboured, 'rowsed' or 'upreared'. Sometimes, pairs of raches were held at strategic points along where the quarry was expected to run, to be uncoupled when the huntsman blew the signal, or when the quarry was seen to come close. The Bloodhound was typically used as a limer, and the raches were normally smaller hounds. A lord's pack would include one or two limers to about 20 or more raches.
A king or lord would want to hunt a great stag, a 'hart of ten', or 'warrantable' stag, or a powerful boar, partly for the extra fat it carried when in prime condition in the hunting season, but mostly for kudos.
In Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Bloodhounds announce the presence of a great boar hiding in a thicket, which then rushes out and plays havoc among the raches of the knight's pack.
Not all game was hunted using the limer. Dame Juliana Berners, writing in The Book of Saint Albans (1486) writes (translation): 'My dear sons, I will now teach each one of you how many kinds of beasts must be upreared with the limer in wood or in fields - both the hart and the buck and the boar so wild. All other animals which are hunted must be sought and found with free-running raches ("ratches so fre").'
Other writers might include the hare, bear, or wolf among animals to be harboured with the limer, but clearly raches could be hunted simply as a pack, as in modern hunting, if chasing 'lesser' game.
After c. 1530 the term 'rache' was hardly used in England, 'running hound' (tr. of chien courant), or mostly just 'hound', being preferred, but the term was still used for a while in Scotland, where the Bloodhound was called the sleuth hound. Hector Boece (1536) describes the rache in Scotland as a versatile scenthound, able to find flesh, fowl, or even fish among the rocks, by smelling. Their translator, Bellenden, says that it is not a large as the sleuth hound. The picture below, though it did not appear in Boece's original, was first published to illustrate their account when it was summarised in Conrad Gessner's Historiae Animalium (Zurich 1554, in Latin).
Obviously raches must have far outnumbered Bloodhounds in the medieval dog population, and may have been quite disparate, depending on the sort of game they were used to hunting. In the picture above from Les Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry (1410) the raches are not all of the same breed. In Great Britain, they may have included the now-extinct North Country Beagle and Southern Hound. As styles of hunting changed, and the Bloodhound fell out of use, packs were normally employed on their own to hunt all quarry. Though their name became obsolete, raches must have continued in this use. We may assume that it was from them, rather than the Bloodhound, that the various breeds of pack hounds such as the English Foxhound, English Staghound, Harrier and Beagle were developed. It is apparent that in the 16th and 17th centuries there was a good deal of regional variation in sizes and types of scenthound, from which the prospective Master of Hounds could mix and match to form their pack.

Queen's School of Religion, formerly Queen's Theological College, is affiliated with Queen's University at Kingston. Graduates receive their degrees from Queen's University. Queen's School of Religion is also accredited by ATS.
Mission
Queen's School of Religion administers the Department of Religious Studies on behalf of Queen's University, and is responsible for training people in the academic study of religion, and educating theological students for academic training and ordained ministry in the Christian faith tradition.
History
Queen's College was founded in 1841 when the Presbyterian Church in Canada obtained a Royal Charter from Queen Victoria. When Queen's College opened its doors in 1842, there were 11 male students. In 1911, the Faculty of Theology was separated from Queen's College when the latter became the newly named secular institution Queen's University at Kingston in order to qualify for government education funding. Queen's Theological College was created by an Act of Parliament on April 1, 1912, as a training institution of the Presbyterian Church of Canada. Queen's Theological College entered the newly formed United Church of Canada upon Union of the Presbyterian, Congregational, and Methodist Churches in Canada in 1925. Queen's Theological College became Queen's School of Religion January 1, 2010, housing both the Department of Religious Studies, and theological programs under one organisation.
In 1925, Queen's Theological College became one of the institutions for theological training for the newly formed United Church of Canada. As Queen's School of Religion, it remains one of six schools in The United Church of Canada with primary responsibility for educating persons for ordained ministry, and is fully accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada.
In November 2015, due to a decline in new admissions, the Queen's University theological programs were closed.
Features and Facilities
Although officially a separate institution, Queen's School of Religion is the only affiliated college of Queen's University at Kingston, and is located in one of the oldest and historic university buildings, Theological Hall, in the heart of the Queen's campus.
Theological Hall itself was built in 1879, and designed by Gordon & Helliwell. Funded completely by donations from the citizens of Kingston, the cornerstone of Theological Hall was laid in 1879 by the Marquis of Lorne, Governor-General of Canada, and their wife, Princess Louise, the fourth daughter of Queen Victoria, and the building was completed in October 1880. The third-oldest building on the Queen's University campus, the massive limestone structure was built in Norman Romanesque style, featuring its trademark double-oak front doorway and central tower flying the Canadian flag. Originally built to house the Faculty of Arts and Science (and to this day is often referred to as the Old Arts and Science Building), Theological Hall was the university's main building throughout the late 19th century. The building features an ornate mediaeval-style Convocation Hall that served the university for convocation ceremonies until Grant Hall was built (between 1902 and 1905), and at one time a circular library at the west end of the building. Morgan Memorial Chapel, with its old-world vaulted ceilings and ecclesiastical stained-glass windows depicting scenes from the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament, was named in honour of the late professor of Theology, William Morgan, and serves the entire university community.
The interior of Convocation Hall is a mix of Romanesque and Gothic with an open, cathedral-like space featuring king-post hammer beam truss enlivened with embellished pendants and articulated bossed junctions, and a combination of red brick and buff brick incorporated into a decorative pattern. The side walls feature a series of round arched windows and the centre of the north wall features a rose window set in a Romanesque niche, which unfortunately was concealed from the interior by renovations carried out in the mid-1960s.
Classroom and office space in Theological Hall was provided for the newly created Queen's Theological College under the provisions of an Act of Parliament respecting Queen's College at Kingston passed on April 1, 1912. From 1912 to 1925, Queen's Theological College prepared students for ordered ministry in the Presbyterian Church of Canada, but the college was transformed from a Presbyterian institution into a United Church of Canada theological institution serving Canada's new national church created by the union of the Methodist, Congregational, and Presbyterian denominations in Canada in 1925.
Theological Hall underwent major internal renovations between 1966 and 1967, which resulted in the creation of additional office space and the installation of an elevator, and today houses both Queen's School of Religion and Queen's University's Faculty of Arts and Science Department of Drama and the Department of Religious Studies.

The Monumental Bronze Company of Bridgeport, Connecticut was a monumental mason firm specializing in the production of white bronze (zinc) monumental masonry, active between 1875 and 1912 with subsidiaries throughout the United States (Des Moines, Iowa, Detroit, Michigan, Chicago, Illinois), and Canada.
There were a number of American companies in the 1880s that through their catalogs sold zinc ornaments nationwide, such as “urns, eagles, civic ornaments, architectural details, and even cigar store Indians.” Mullins of Salem, Ohio was the most prominent but only Monumental Bronze purveyed it in grave markers.
A popular white bronze model was the "Infantryman" that was used in the 1880s by many American towns, to commemorate those who served in the Civil War.
In the late 1800s, the company sold two versions of a Civil War soldier memorial, with nearly identical designs. The Union model had "U.S." (United States) on the belt buckle, while the Confederate model had "C.S." (Confederate States).

Angola competed at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 September to 18 September 2016.
Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.
Delegation
The country sent a team of 4 athletes, 2 men and 2 women, along with 4 officials to the 2016 Summer Paralympics.

Sally Anne Wainwright (born 1963) is an English television writer, producer, and director from Yorkshire. Early in their career, Wainwright worked as a playwright, and as a scriptwriter on the long-running radio serial drama The Archers. In the 1990s, Wainwright began their television career, and, in 2000, created their first original drama series At Home with the Braithwaites (2000–2003).
They won the Royal Television Society's Writer of the Year Award for the 2009 mini-series Unforgiven. Wainwright is known for their creation of the ITV drama series Scott & Bailey (2011–2016), Last Tango in Halifax (2012-2020), and Happy Valley (2014–present). Last Tango in Halifax won the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series in 2013, whilst Happy Valley won the same award in both 2015 and 2017.
Wainwright is the creator of the 2019 HBO and BBC One television series Gentleman Jack starring Suranne Jones as Anne Lister and Sophie Rundle as Ann Walker.
Early life
Wainwright was born in 1963 in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, to Harry Wainwright and Dorothy Wainwright (née Crowther). Wainwright was brought up in Sowerby Bridge where they attended Triangle C of E Primary School and Sowerby Bridge High School. They attended the University of York, reading English and Related Literature. They have an older sister, Diane Hilton, a housing professional with The Guinness Partnership.
Wainwright said that they had always wanted to write, and had started writing when they were young, from the time they were nine years old, and wanted to write for Coronation Street. They said that when they were 16 years old in 1980 they saw a play called Bastard Angel by playwright Barrie Keeffe at the Royal Shakespeare Company and was deeply interested in its short sentences and naturalistic approach to dialogue.
Career
While at the University of York, Wainwright took an original play called Hanging On to the Edinburgh Festival and found an agent, Meg Davis, for their writing in the process. Meanwhile, they worked as a bus driver. When they were 24, they left the driving job after they started writing for the Radio 4 series The Archers. One of their contributions was to write an atypical story for the long-running radio soap in which the village shop was robbed. After that they wrote for Coronation Street, developing their writing skills, from 1994 to 1999. They have since said that working on continuing drama was "a great education in discipline and a lesson that great stories are hard work". They were mentored by Kay Mellor who encouraged them to stop writing for soaps and to concentrate instead on original work. They created the TV series At Home with the Braithwaites about a woman who had secretly won the lottery. The programme was nominated for multiple awards. In 2006, they wrote the drama series Jane Hall, which depicts the life of a female bus driver in London. Wainwright drew on their own experiences in scripting the series.
They won the 2009 Writer of the Year Award given by the RTS in 2009 for Unforgiven which took several awards including the best TV series.
Wainwright says that their strong yet flawed female characters are "almost real" to them and arrive "fully formed" in their imagination. They like to control the television that is created and has done some directing and producing of their own work partly to ensure the scenery and dialogue reflects Yorkshire.
In 2011, they wrote Scott & Bailey, a series about two female police officers. The idea for the series came from the actores Suranne Jones and Sally Lindsay and former Detective Inspector Diane Taylor, who assisted with bringing the series to air.
Wainwright based the plot of their series Last Tango in Halifax on the story of their mother who was widowed in 2001. Them mother, Dorothy, moved to Oxfordshire to live with their daughter and rediscovered a lost love via Friends Reunited. With their mother's permission, Wainwright developed the story of how they remarried so rapidly, showing extracts from the series to their mother before broadcast.
When they told the story to Nicola Shindler, they suggested they turn their mother's experience into a television series. Shindler became the series' executive producer. Both Last Tango in Halifax and their crime series Scott & Bailey were turned down by both the BBC and ITV before being accepted retrospectively. The former was voted by BAFTA to be the best series in 2012 and Wainwright was given the award for best writer.
Happy Valley, which was shot in Yorkshire's upper Upper Calder Valley and Hebden Bridge, stars Sarah Lancashire, whom Wainwright had in mind as they wrote the role. Wainwright made their directorial debut with episode 4 of the first series. Wainwright has said that they are willing to write a third series of Happy Valley, but they have previous commitments to work on other projects. Producer Nicola Shindler has indicated that the third series would not air until 2018 at the earliest.
In 2016, Wainwright was made a Fellow of the Royal Television Society.
Wainwright wrote and directed a two-hour drama special for BBC One entitled To Walk Invisible: The Bronte Sisters, which aired on BBC One in 2016 and in the US in 2017. Its subject is the Brontë family, particularly the relationship the three sisters, Anne, Emily and Charlotte, had with their brother, Branwell. While working on the drama, Wainwright said "I am thrilled beyond measure that I've been asked by the BBC to bring to life these three fascinating, talented, ingenious Yorkshire women."
In 2019, Wainwright's Gentleman Jack, a drama about the 18th-century Yorkshire landowner, diarist, and open lesbian, Anne Lister, played by Suranne Jones, and Lister's courtship of Ann Walker, played by Sophie Rundle, premiered on both BBC One in the UK and HBO in the US.
Personal life
Wainwright, who lives in Oxfordshire, is married to Ralph "Austin" Sherlaw-Johnson, an antiquarian sheet music dealer, son of the composer, pianist, and music scholar Robert Sherlaw Johnson. They have two sons and own two Maine Coon cats.
Wainwright was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2020 Birthday Honours for services to writing and television.

Peter Lisagor (August 5, 1915 – December 10, 1976) was Washington bureau chief of the Chicago Daily News from 1959 to 1976 and was one of the most respected and best-known journalists in the United States. Lisagor gained nationwide recognition from their syndicated column and appearances on such public-affairs broadcasts as Meet the Press, Face the Nation, Washington Week in Review, and Agronsky & Company.
Early life
Lisagor was born in Keystone, West Virginia and moved to Chicago at age 14, where they attended Marshall High School. They graduated from the University of Michigan with a bachelor's degree in political science.
Career
Lisagor began their career in journalism in 1939 as a sportswriter for the Daily News. During World War II they were a sergeant in the Army, serving as a correspondent and London editor for the service newspaper, Stars and Stripes. They returned to the Daily News after the war.
Awards
In 1948 Lisagor was selected for a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University. They were a recipient of the Newspaper Guild's Page One award, the George Foster Peabody Broadcasting award, the William Allen White award and the Edward Weintal Prize for diplomatic reporting. They served as president of the White House Correspondents Association, the Gridiron Club, the Overseas Writers Association, and the State Department Correspondents Association.
In 1977, the United States' largest chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists, the Chicago Headline Club, established the Peter Lisagor Awards "to inspire Chicago-area journalists to follow their outstanding example and to recognize truly superior contributions to journalism."
After Peter Lisagor died, their colleagues on Washington Week in Review gave Mr. Lisagor's explanation of their own philosophy of reporting: "Ride down the middle of the street, shooting out windows on both sides."
The competition's categories range from in-depth reporting and public service to business, commentary and feature reporting.
Death
Lisagor died in 1976 of complications from cancer of the lung and larynx.  They are interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

The City Council of Seville () was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Seville, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Elections to the local councils in Spain were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years.
Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over 18 years of age, registered in the municipality of Seville and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-nationals whose country of origin allowed Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with an electoral threshold of five percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each local council. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale:
The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, the appointee would be determined by lot.
The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in the municipality for which they were seeking election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. For the case of Seville, as its population was between 300,001 and 1,000,000, at least 5,000 signatures were required.
Opinion polls
The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The "Lead" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a poll. When available, seat projections determined by the polling organisations are displayed below (or in place of) the percentages in a smaller font; 16 seats were required for an absolute majority in the City Council of Seville.

Lumo is a 2007 documentary film about twenty-year-old Lumo Sinai, a woman who fell victim to "Africa's First World War." While returning home one day, Lumo and another woman were gang-raped by a group of soldiers fighting for control of the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. As a result, Lumo suffered from a traumatic fistula, a chronic condition that leaves them unable to bear children. Rejected by their fiancé and most of the village, Lumo examines a woman's tragedy and the process of healing.
Lumo was directed and produced by Bent-Jorgen Perlmutt, Nelson Walker III, Louis Abelman and Lynn True and was aired as part of PBS's Point of View series in 2007.

Thraco-Macedonian is a conventional name in the study of ancient history to describe the political geography of Macedonia (region) in antiquity. It may refer to:
Thraco-Macedonian coins or Thraco-Macedonian standard. Ancient Greek coins of Thracian tribes (or tribes who have been labelled as Thracian) in Macedonia (region), like those of Bergaios and Derrones. The earliest coins date in the 6th century BC from the mine district of Pangaion Hills. In style and types they bear a resemblance to another series of coins conjecturally assigned to Thasos. Thraco-Macedonian may also include types of coins from Greek city-states in Macedonia (region). Later when the whole region was annexed to the Macedonian kingdom, some coins of cities and tribes continued to be minted and circulated. So an appropriate and clarifying term for coins minted by the kingdom is 'Macedonian royal coinage'.
Thraco-Macedonian region. Usually it comprises the geographical region of East Macedonia, modern Serres, Kavala, Drama and Blagoevgrad provinces (ancient regions of Bisaltia, Odomantike, Sintike, Edonis and Maedike. However, it may also include ancient regions of central Macedonia, also known as Thrace in antiquity (between Homeric geography and 4th century BC); Chalcidice, Mygdonia and Pieria. As an example, even the Late Roman era writer Stephanus places Methone of Pieria and Torone of Chalcidice, in Thrace.
Thraco-Macedonian mythology Greek mythology of Macedonia with Thracian characters or related mythology to the Thracian tribes of Macedonia (like the tomb of Orpheus in Pieria and Bisaltes).

The Battle of Gloucester was a skirmish fought between November 25, 1777 and the early morning of November 26, 1777, during the Philadelphia campaign of the American Revolutionary War. It was the first battlefield command for the Marquis de Lafayette.
Background
In mid-1777, British General William Howe embarked on a plan to regain control of Britain's rebellious Thirteen Colonies by capturing Philadelphia, the city where the Continental Congress met. They successfully captured the city in September 1777, and then, after consolidating their command of the city by repulsing an attack from General George Washington's Continental Army at Germantown in October, sought to gain control of the Delaware River as far north as the city, on which their army depended for supplies.
After a Hessian assault on Fort Mercer, one of the principal defenses on the New Jersey side of the river, was repulsed in the Battle of Red Bank, Howe sent part of their army across the Delaware to Gloucester, New Jersey under the command of Lord Cornwallis to take Fort Mercer. Washington reacted to this by detaching forces under General Nathanael Greene across the Delaware just north of Gloucester.
Greene was accompanied by the Marquis de Lafayette, a young French officer who had accompanied Washington at the Battle of Brandywine. Lafayette had been wounded in the foot in that battle, and, while it was not fully healed, they were eager to join the action. Greene ordered Lafayette out on a reconnaissance mission to determine the location and strength of Cornwallis' army.
Battle
Lafayette led 350 men toward the British position. They carefully scouted the British camp, at times personally coming within firing range of British sentries. They then led their men in a surprise attack on a forward picket of jägers. The 400 Hessians were caught completely unprepared, and began a disorganized fighting retreat toward the main British camp, with Lafayette and their men giving chase. Cornwallis sent some grenadiers to provide covering fire as the Germans retreated, and Lafayette withdrew under cover of darkness, returning to Greene.
Aftermath
Lafayette's reconnaissance was a success. They suffered only one killed and five wounded, against 60 casualties on the British side. Word of the operation was instrumental in a decision by Congress to award them a commission as a major general in the Continental Army.

Ektopodon is an extinct genus of marsupial, and is the type genus of the family Ektopodontidae which occurred in forested environments in South Australia, Queensland and Victoria. The last species of this group went extinct in the early Pleistocene (between 2.588 million years ago and 781,000 years ago). Its body mass was estimated around 1300 grams. Scientists believe that ektopodontids were highly specialised seed-eating possums.
The type species Ektopodon serratus describes material excavated at the Lake Ngapakaldi fossil site in South Australia.

Colobraro (Lucano: ) is a town and comune in the province of Matera, in the southern Italian region of Basilicata. The town is positioned on a high hill dominating the valley of river Sinni near the town of Valsinni.
Geography
Colobraro is located in southern Italy in the region of Basilicata. It is one of the agricultural centers in the Sinni River valley. It is located on the southern slopes of Mount Calvario at a height of 630 m, with views of the whole Ionian Sea coast. Colobraro is located near Highway 653, not far from the dam built on the Sinni river and Mount Cotugno. It borders the towns of Valsinni, Tursi, Rotondella, Senise, Sant'Arcangelo and Noepoli. Colobraro is about 80 km from the province's capital of Matera, and about 130 km from the region's capital of Potenza.
History
The hamlet is known as the "village without name": its name is considered bringer of bad luck in the towns around, where Colobraro is usually mentioned in the local dialects simply as chillu paese, cudd' puaise or chill' pais, all simply meaning "that village".
The reason for Colobraro being called “that village” or “the unlucky village” is because a lawyer, who had won many cases, was pursuing a case in this town, and they proclaimed that if they were not correct, that the chandelier which was in the court would fall. At that exact moment, the chandelier fell and shattered. Ever since the town became known for being associated with unluckiness.
Throughout, many instances of freak accidents, and instances involving 'masciare', powerful women that were known in the 1950s in southern Italy for casting spells and using black magic, finished the reputation for Colobraro being unlucky, and being cursed.
Not only, the name Colobraro, derives from the Latin word 'coluber', meaning serpent, seen as the embodiment of evil.

The Argus bare-eye (Phlegopsis barringeri) is a species of bird in the family Thamnophilidae.
Known only from a single male specimen taken in 1951 in Colombia, its taxonomic validity is questionable, and most authorities do not recognize it, following Willis (1979) and Graves (1992), where it was shown to be a hybrid between the black-spotted and the reddish-winged bare-eye.

Chapin's obsessions with surfboard design brought Dora into contact with California industrial designers including visits to the studio of Charles and Ray Eames.
Dora's signature surfboard, released in 1966, became the biggest selling surfboard in history, and again on its re-release 25 years later. The visibility of surfers such as Dora as well as the impact of the book Gidget meant many new surfers were starting to surf and thus crowding out existing surfers such as Dora. This sudden influx of surfers caused Dora to decry the masses both in person and in advertisements for their surfboards, one of which features Dora being crucified on two of their boards.
They decided to leave the U.S. in 1970 and lived around the world spending a majority of their time in France and South Africa. After they returned to the US from France in 1981, they were subsequently arrested by the FBI for violating their parole by leaving the country in 1975 after pleading guilty to writing a bad check for the purchase of ski equipment. While serving time for that, they were sentenced to six months in federal prison after a Denver grand jury indicted them for credit card fraud in 1982.
Despite their perceived mistrust towards the commercialization of surfing, Dora did enter into a profit sharing arrangement with Greg Noll to release a limited number of Miki Dora "da cat" surfboards, during which time they created magazine advertisements promoting the boards.
They died at their father's home in Montecito, California, on January 3, 2002, at age 67 from pancreatic cancer.
Accusations of racism
Surfing books often focus only on Dora's heroic and charismatic side. Dora was also known for being surly and standoffish. They were also referred to as a bigot and a white supremacist. Notably, they painted a swastika on their surfboard at least once. Dora's idea of "localism" - that the waves belonged to those who grew up near them, and outsiders deserved violence to be kept away - has also been criticized as terrible and de facto racist.
Nat Young, world surfing champion in 1966 and 1970, knew Dora. As Young told an interviewer: “Dora's take is push the black man under. He's a supreme racist, always has been. Dora moved to South Africa in the 1970s and was an ardent supporter of the apartheid. When I was younger, I believed it was all just in mirth, that they were just jivin' it all; but no, they believe absolutely in white supremacy.”

Sex and Repression in Savage Society is a 1927 book by anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski. It is considered "a famous critique of psychoanalysis, arguing that the 'Oedipus complex' described by Freud is not universal." Malinowski gives a partial explanation of the role of sex in social organization through the synthesis of psychoanalysis and anthropology, considered competing academic disciplines at the time. The book is considered an important contribution to psychoanalysis, which Malinowski acknowledged was a "popular craze of the day."
I have never been in any sense a follower of psycho-analytic practice, or an adherent of psycho-analytic theory; and now, while impatient of the exorbitant claims of psycho-analysis, of its chaotic arguments and tangled terminology, I must yet acknowledge a deep sense of indebtedness to it for stimulation as well for valuable instruction in some aspects of human psychology.
The book is divided into four parts. In Part 1 (The Formation of a Complex), they lay out the issues related to childhood sexuality through puberty and maternal roles. In Part 2 (The Mirror of Tradition) they examine myth and taboo related to family dynamics. In Part 3 (Psycho-analysis and Anthropology), they examine the rift between the two disciplines and looks at the role parricide may have as a foundation of culture. In Part 4 (Instinct and Culture), they examine how humans made the transition from animalistic instincts to organized society, situating the family as "the cradle of nascent culture." They describe how taboos that develop within a society must then be enforced through authority and repression.
Malinowski's studies of the Trobriand islanders challenged the Freudian proposal that psychosexual development (e.g. the Oedipus complex) was universal. They reported that in the insular matriarchal society of the Trobriand, boys are disciplined by their maternal uncles, not their fathers; impartial, avuncular discipline. Malinowski reported that boys dreamed of feared uncles, not of beloved fathers, thus, power — not sexual jealousy — is the source of Oedipal conflict in such non–Western societies.

Howard Fine is an American acting teacher, celebrity acting coach, Broadway theater director, and author.  They are the founder of the Howard Fine Acting Studio in Hollywood and in Melbourne, Australia.
Early life
Fine was born in Providence, Rhode Island, they are the youngest of five children. Their parents, Max, an American GI, and Nelly, a Holocaust survivor, were married in Shanghai before returning to the U.S. Due to a fluke scheduling conflict between French and German classes, Fine ended up taking their first theater class in high school. Fine's drama teacher spotted their directing talent and entrusted them with their first play to direct, Edward Albee's The Sandbox, at the age of 16. They were first introduced to the work of their mentor, Uta Hagen, while in high school. Fine's high school drama teacher taught from Hagen's first book, Respect for Acting, and would eventually take their class to New York City to watch classes at Hagen's studio. Howard never studied with Uta as an actor, and by the time they met they were each established teachers in their field. Their mutual love of teaching led to a close friendship between them which lasted until Hagen's death in 2004.
Career
Early career
Fine completed their BA in Communication/Theater at Rhode Island College. After completing graduate school in Boston, Fine moved to New York City, where they landed their first teaching job at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. After one semester of teaching, they were promoted to head of the Acting Department at the age of 24, making them the youngest head in the studio's history. It was here that they developed a year-long training program known as "The Foundation", a version of which they still teach at their studios in Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia.
Acting teacher
In 1985, Fine moved to Los Angeles with their best friend, Voice coach David Coury. Fine began their career in Los Angeles by privately coaching students in their living room, but in 1988, they had to expand to accommodate their growing classes. Their studio has relocated several times since this 1980's before occupying its present location, 1320 N Highland Ave, at Fountain. Fine received national recognition for their teaching in 2006 when named "Best Acting Teacher in Los Angeles" in Backstage West "Best of Los Angeles" issue.
Fine is still a full-time acting teacher and coach, and throughout the year they teach their 9-week Foundation course, as well as several sections of ongoing scene study. Their techniques are mostly derivative of Uta Hagen's teachings, and offer actors a practical approach of working in all media: whereas most acting schools focus on either imagination or hyper-realism, Fine believes actors need both. The Howard Fine Acting Studio is home to a unique Speech & Singing for Actors program, various intensives for actors of all experience levels, and a monthly series of entertainment industry talks made available to the public. They also offer annual masterclasses in Sydney, Australia, and at their studio in Melbourne, Australia. Howard is an adjunct faculty member for the University of Texas Austin's Theater & Dance Department, and teaches students visiting from various college/conservatory programs at their Los Angeles studio. Fine has a list of students spanning decades which include working actors, celebrity singers, professional athletes, and artists who have gone on to win Tony, Emmy, and Academy Awards.
Theater director
In addition to being an acting coach, Fine is also an accomplished theater director. Their sole Broadway credit is for directing Michael Chiklis when they replaced Rob Becker in Defending the Caveman. The Internet Broadway Data Base and Playbill records of this production are incomplete. However, this credit has been verified by other sources including Backstage Magazine. Chiklis details the experience in the foreword of Howard's book, and physical copies of the original playbill credit Howard Fine as the director. Other credits include directing Elizabeth Berkley, Aasif Mandvi, Ally Sheedy, and Rachel Dratch in David Lindsay-Abaire's That Other Person as part of the best of the 24-hour plays on Broadway. Howard is credited in the published version of the play. They won a Drama-logue award and received an Ovation Award nomination for their direction of Billy Campbell in Fortinbras.
Author
Fine is the author of Fine on Acting: A Vision of the Craft, from Havenhurst Books. In their book, Fine offers specifics on their technique as well as practical exercises designed to help actors in all levels of the industry. The book features a foreword by actor Michael Chiklis who writes, "His philosophy and approach to the craft of acting are the most helpful, encouraging and practically applicable I've ever encountered." Fine also occasionally contributes to a blog containing teaching insights, expanded thoughts from topics covered in their book, and new thoughts for actors in the ever-changing landscape of show business.
For years, Fine has been asked by the Los Angeles Times to analyze the acting of the Oscar nominees. Their Oscar commentary has been featured on Entertainment Tonight, Extra, Access Hollywood, E, Sky TV, BBC, and CNN. In addition to the Los Angeles Times, Fine has been quoted in The Times, The Christian Science Monitor, and USA Today Weekend, and has spoken on numerous radio shows in both the US and overseas. Fine has also contributed to the Huffington Post with commentary on current events.

Scandal Street is a 1938 American drama film directed by James P. Hogan and written by Bertram Millhauser and Eddie Welch. The film stars Lew Ayres, Louise Campbell, Roscoe Karns, Porter Hall, Edgar Kennedy and Elizabeth Patterson. The film was released on February 11, 1938, by Paramount Pictures.
Plot
Cast
Reception
Frank Nugent of The New York Times said, "The fictional half of the Criterion's bill is filled by a well-wrought B-plus melodrama from Paramount, an entertaining tidbit called Scandal Street, which considers, for the 'steenth time, the cruelty, malice and stupidity of small-town gossips. Here it is Louise Campbell who suffers the tongue-lashing and the guilty-until-proved-innocent attitude of Peach-tree Lane's residents when the married Don Juan in the next-door house is found murdered. Fortunately, they have wee Virginia Weidler on their side, as well as right, and the murder outs conveniently. As small-town profiles go, this is as definitive as the next, with penetrating sidelights on the weekly bridge nights, the children's dancing school, amours and civic pride."

The glossy-backed becard (Pachyramphus surinamus) is a species of bird in the family Tityridae. It has traditionally been placed in Cotingidae or Tyrannidae, but evidence strongly suggests that it is better placed in Tityridae, where it is now placed by the South American Classification Committee. It is found in Brazil, French Guiana, and Suriname. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests.

The Let's Talk About Love World Tour is the eighth concert tour by Canadian recording artist Celine Dion. Visiting North America, Asia and Europe; the trek supported Dion's fifth English and fifteenth studio album Let's Talk About Love (1997). and their eleventh French and sixteenth studio album, S'il suffisait d'aimer (1998). The tour marks Dion's last worldwide tour until their Taking Chances World Tour in 2008–2009. Initially planned for 1998, the success of the tour continued into 1999. In 1998, the tour earned nearly $30 million from its concerts in North America alone. In Japan, tickets were immediately sold out on the first day of public sale. It was also nominated for "Major Tour of the Year" and "Most Creative Stage Production" at the Pollstar Industry Awards. Overall, the tour grossed about $91.2 million from 69 reported shows.
Background
During a press conference following their win at the 25th Annual American Music Awards, Dion stated they would like to start touring during the summer of 1998. Following the award show appearance, the singer performed at the Crown Showroom in Melbourne and the Blaisdell Arena in Honolulu with a set list similar to that in the Falling Into You Tour, but also including "The Reason" and "My Heart Will Go On". The tour was officially announced in February 1998. Originally called Celine Dion: On Tour 1998, the tour was set to begin August in Boston, this would mark the third time Dion has begun a tour in the city. They say it is the closest U.S. city to Montreal and considers it a "lucky charm".
The tour was sponsored by Procter & Gamble (Canada), Avon (Europe) and Ericsson (United States). The telecommunications company initiated an aggressive campaign with Dion. Commercials were shown throughout the US and Canada showing concertgoers using their cell phones as lighters during Dion's performance. Those who purchased an Ericsson phone were given a special behind-the-scenes tour video entitled "Celine Dion: In Them Own Words". The tour was met early with controversy as the singer's performance at Madison Square Garden was subject to a ticket scam. During the trek, Dion opened the Broward County Civic Arena. The concert was attended by nearly 20,000 spectators and was sold out with 2 two hours.
Dion further remarked the setlist of the tour will contain songs from their current album, their hits and a few French selections. They continued:"I'm going to definitely sing the new songs and a few French ones and definitely people's favorite. I can't do them all, unfortunately, because I have to do a two-hour show. It would take a long time to sing all my songs. I hope we have chosen the right ones for people to hear".
During the course of the tour, Dion released a French-language album entitled, S'il suffisait d'aimer and a Christmas album called, These Are Special Times. In November 1998, Dion had their first CBS special promoting the album. It featured Rosie O'Donnell performing "Do You Hear What I Hear?" with Dion. The show received two Emmy Award nominations. The singer ended the year with performing at the Billboard Music Award, Top of the Pops and an appearance on Touched by an Angel.
As the tour continued into 1999, Dion performed in Hong Kong, Japan and an additional outing for North America. During this time, Dion's husband René Angélil was diagnosed with skin cancer. This forced the singer to postpone the remaining dates in the U.S. and the entire European leg. Dion resumed the tour in mid-June and thanked fans for their support during the rough period. After their tour of Europe, Dion's team announced the singer would give a special New Year's Eve concert in Montreal. Dubbed "The Millennium Concert" the show featured a new setlist and special appearances by prominent Canadian singers. At the same time, David Foster began negotiations to have Dion, Barbra Streisand, Whitney Houston and Andrea Bocelli to conduct a mini-tour titled "Three Divas and a Tenor". The tour never came to fruition.
In October, Dion opened the new Pepsi Center in Denver, replacing the McNichols Sports Arena. Dion dedicated the concert to the victims and survivors of the Columbine High School massacre. All proceeds from the show were donated to Colorado Organization of Victim Assistance. The singer was joined onstage by the Colorado Children's Chorale to perform "Let's Talk About Love" and "Friend of Mine Columbine"— a memorial song written by Stephen and Jonathan Cohen. The singer stated it would be their last tour as they wanted to focus on becoming a mother. Later, Dion released their first English greatest hits album, All the Way... A Decade of Song. The album was promoted by Dion's second CBS special, taking place at Radio City Music Hall. The special featured Dion performing their classics along with new songs on the album. The show featured duets with 'N Sync and Gloria Estefan. After their break, Dion began their first residency show at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace from 2003 to 2007. The tour serves as Dion's final concert tour until 2008 for the Taking Chances World Tour.
About the stage
The tour brought a new aspect to performing for Dion. The show was presented in the round. The stage designer Yves Aucoin states they wanted the show to be a big production while having an intimate feel. The stage itself was shaped like a heart with five circular platforms that raised and lowered the members of the stage. The constructor is Scène Éthique. Above, four large video screens formed a circular pattern. The floor of the stage was made of large video screens utilizing the JumboTron technology. Dion initially was nervous performing in the way, as the performer had very little time to relax while on stage. They continue to say they got the idea from attending a Stevie Wonder concert during their childhood. The entire production cost more than $10 million.

During the concert at the Orlando Arena, Dion performed "Fly". During the same concert, Dion was joined onstage by Diana King to perform "Treat Them Like a Lady".
During the New York City concert on 3 September 1998, Diana King also joined Dion for "Treat Their Like a Lady", and comedian Ana Gasteyer made a surprise appearance reprising their famous spoof of Dion from Saturday Night Live on stage in a funny onstage sketch.
During the concert at the Broward County Civic Arena, Dion was joined onstage by the Bee Gees to perform "Immortality".
During concerts in 1999, "I'm Your Angel" was performed in lieu of "Love Is On the Way". Additionally, "The Power of Love" was performed in lieu of "All By Myself".

Cancellations and rescheduled shows
Broadcasts and recordings
The first glimpse of the tour came via Dion's music video to "S'il suffisait d'aimer", which was recorded during their concert in Chicago. Footage of that show, along with footage of one of the December 1998 Montreal concerts was also shown on the TV special "Un An Avec Céline" hosted by Julie Snyder. The final show at the National Car Rental Center was filmed and showed on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The special also includes a behind the scenes feature. The singer also performed "To Love You More" live in Tokyo for the United Negro College Fund's "An Evening of Stars". The millennium concert was aired on TVA (Canada).
The concerts at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis were recorded for a CD/DVD package. The performances were released under the title Au cœur du stade (meaning At the Heart of the Stadium). The package were released separately with DVD following the CD release. The DVD includes exclusive footage from the making of S'il suffisait d'aimer and Let's Talk About Love. It features an appearance by guest star Sir George Martin, and rare footage of Céline Dion, Barbra Streisand, David Foster, and the "Tell Him" lyricists chatting around the piano.
For the show, Jean-Jacques Goldman joined Celine Dion on "J'irai où tu iras", "To Love You More" features Taro Hakase on violin, and Diana King can be seen on a screen during "Treat Them Like a Lady". The CD contains an abbreviated version of the concert, primarily showcasing their French-language songs. A live video of "Dans Un Autre Monde" was used to promote both the CD and DVD packages. The anglophone version of the tour has not been released to the public.
Critical reception
For the tour, Dion received mainly positive reviews from music critics. Many of the writers commended the singer's intimate connection with the audience, despite the massive size of the stadiums and arenas. For the inaugural concert in Boston, Steve Morse (The Boston Globe) writes "Despite Dion's nerves, they were able to pull off a successful concert". They continue, "For pure entertainment, however, this was a volcanic triumph". Dion thanked Boston fans for being "lucky charm people"; this was the third time they opened a world tour here.
At The Arena in Oakland, James Sullivan (San Francisco Chronicle) felt the night showed off Dion's prowess as a performer. They elaborated, "Easily the best part of the 80-minute set came when Dion summoned their band to center stage, where they sat on the lip of the riser as they essayed a medley of some favorite songs. Roberta Flack's 'The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face', the Beatles' 'Pet Sounds'-inspired 'Because' and Eric Clapton's 'Tears in Heaven' were all delivered with tender care—no small feat in a basketball gym. Even Sinatra's 'All the Way' steered clear of swagger, and the accordion gave all four songs a touch of Dion's romantic French-language roots".
Adam Sandler (Variety) provided a positive review of Dion's concert at the Great Western Forum. They state, "To their credit, Celine Dion kept the vocal histrionics and hyper stage movements they have become known for to a minimum during their sold-out show Wednesday at the Forum, preferring instead to illustrate their evolution as an artist through singing prowess and a relaxed stage manner". Jane Stevenson (Jam! Music) gave the singer's show at the new Air Canada Centre four out of five stars. They say, "But as the first song of the night, 'Let's Talk About Love', progressed, their nine-person band eventually rose up alongside her, while a children's choir later took the stage for the song's big ending".

Radford is an inner-city area of Nottingham, located just outside the city centre. The appropriate ward of the City of Nottingham Council is called Radford and Park with a population of 21,414. It is bounded on the south by Lenton and Nottingham City Centre, and comprises around of land.
History
St Peter's Church, Radford was given by William Peveril to Lenton Priory. The church was rebuilt in 1812 at a cost of £2,000. The Wesleyan chapel was built in 1805 and enlarged in 1828. In September 1878 a chapel was built on St Peter's Street by the United Methodist Free Churches at a cost of £1,900. It was closed owing to declining membership and income in June 1947 and purchased by the Evangelical Free Church.
Radford Registration District (RD) was created on 1 July 1837 on the introduction of Statutory Registration of Births, Marriages and Deaths (BMD) - and was abolished, and absorbed into Nottingham RD, on 1 July 1880.
Population by year
1811 - 5,704
1821 - 7,348
1831 - 16,568
1841 - 22,473
1851 - 12,635
1901 - 34,354
Background
The area has a large ethnic minority population (mainly European, West Indian, African, Arab, Asian, South American, Polish and increasingly Kurdish), and accordingly there is a large number of specialist food and retail shops catering to specific cultures, owing to the relatively cheap nature of housing in the area (and the large number of old Victorian properties converted into flats and bedsits).
Radford has a large student population, most of whom attend the nearby Nottingham Trent University and University of Nottingham.
Industry
Radford was the home of
Raleigh Industries once the world's largest bicycle producer
Player's cigarettes, with a range of buildings housing factories, offices and warehouses
Manlove, Alliott & Co. Ltd. inventors of incinerators for waste disposal.
Culture
It provides the backdrop for much of Alan Sillitoe's book Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. Numerous scenes from the film of the book which starred Albert Finney were shot in Radford.

Classification of wetlands has been a problematical task, with the commonly accepted definition of what constitutes a wetland being among the major difficulties. A number of national wetland classifications exist. In the 1970s, the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance introduced a first attempt to establish an internationally acceptable wetland classification scheme.
Ramsar classification
The Ramsar classification of wetland types is intended as a means for fast identification of the main types of wetlands for the purposes of the Convention.
The wetlands are classified into three major classes:
Marine/coastal wetlands
Inland wetlands
Human-made wetlands
These are further subdivided by the type of water: fresh / saline / brackish / alkaline; and may be further classified by the substrate type of other characteristics.
National systems of classification
Australia
Wetlands in Australia that considered to be of national importance are so classified by criteria published in association with the Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia (DIWA).
The following list is that used within Australia to classify wetland by type:
A—Marine and Coastal Zone wetlands
Marine waters—permanent shallow waters less than six metres deep at low tide; includes sea bays, straits
Subtidal aquatic beds; includes kelp beds, seagrasses, tropical marine meadows
Coral reefs
Rocky marine shores; includes rocky offshore islands, sea cliffs
Sand, shingle or pebble beaches; includes sand bars, spits, sandy islets
Intertidal mud, sand or salt flats
Intertidal marshes; includes saltmarshes, salt meadows, saltings, raised salt marshes, tidal brackish and freshwater marshes
Intertidal forested wetlands; includes mangrove swamps, nipa swamps, tidal freshwater swamp forests
Brackish to saline lagoons and marshes with one or more relatively narrow connections with the sea
Freshwater lagoons and marshes in the coastal zone
Non-tidal freshwater forested wetlands
B—Inland wetlands
Permanent rivers and streams; includes waterfalls
Seasonal and irregular rivers and streams
Inland deltas (permanent)
Riverine floodplains; includes river flats, flooded river basins, seasonally flooded grassland, savanna and palm savanna
Permanent freshwater lakes (> 8 ha); includes large oxbow lakes
Seasonal/intermittent freshwater lakes (> 8 ha), floodplain lakes
Permanent saline/brackish lakes
Seasonal/intermittent saline lakes
Permanent freshwater ponds (< 8 ha), marshes and swamps on inorganic soils; with emergent vegetation waterlogged for at least most of the growing season
Seasonal/intermittent freshwater ponds and marshes on inorganic soils; includes sloughs, potholes; seasonally flooded meadows, sedge marshes
Lakeshore mudflats in freshwater lakes and ponds
Permanent saline/brackish marshes
Seasonal saline marshes
Shrub swamps; shrub-dominated freshwater marsh, shrub carr, alder thicket on inorganic soils
Freshwater swamp forest; seasonally flooded forest, wooded swamps; on inorganic soils
Peatlands; forest, shrub or open bogs
Alpine and tundra wetlands; includes alpine meadows, tundra pools, temporary waters from snow melt
Freshwater springs, oases and rock pools
Geothermal wetlands
Inland, subterranean karst wetlands
C—Human-made wetlands
Water storage areas; reservoirs, barrages, hydro-electric dams, impoundments (generally > 8 ha)
Ponds, including farm ponds, stock ponds, small tanks (generally < 8 ha)
Aquaculture ponds; fish ponds, shrimp ponds
Salt exploitation; salt pans, salines
Excavations; gravel pits, borrow pits, mining pools
Wastewater treatment; sewage farms, settling ponds, oxidation basins
Irrigated land and irrigation channels; rice fields, canals, ditches
Seasonally flooded arable land, farm land
United States
Wetlands of the United States are classified according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory (NWI).
In the US, the best known classification systems are the Cowardin classification system and the hydrogeomorphic (HGM) classification system.

Dermot Walsh (10 September 1924 – 26 June 2002) was an Irish stage, film and television actor, known for portraying King Richard the Lionheart in the 1962 television series Richard the Lionheart.
Early life
Born in Dublin, Walsh was the son of a journalist and a civil servant. They attended St Mary's College, Rathmines, and on the wishes of their parents, read Law at University College Dublin. Walsh studied acting at the Abbey Theatre School and spent three years with Lord Longford's repertory company at the Gate Theatre, working as an assistant stage hand.
Career
In 1945 Walsh moved to Britain and briefly joined the Croydon Repertory. Upon their return to Dublin they were spotted by a talent scout from the Rank Organisation. This led to parts in Bedelia, Hungry Hill and The Mark of Cain, and the beginning of Walsh's career in film. They appeared in seven films as a leading man, before returning to the theatre. Walsh later resumed their film career in a series of B movies. They appeared in over forty films made for film and a hundred for television, making their final film appearance in 1983.
Walsh made their first London stage appearance in George Bernard Shaw's Buoyant Billions at the Prince's Theatre in 1949. A prolific theatre actor, Walsh's many theatre credits included Reluctant Heroes, The Man Most Likely To, Laburnum Grove and The Mousetrap. They also turned their hand to writing and producing, writing the play The Murder Line in 1967 and producing later productions, including Blithe Spirit and Stage Struck.
Walsh's television work included appearances in Danger Man, No Hiding Place and Softly, Softly. They also played the title role in all 39 half-hour episodes of the series Richard the Lionheart in 1962 and 1963.
Personal life
Walsh was married three times. They married the actor Hazel Court in 1949, and the couple had a daughter, Sally (born 1950), before they were divorced in 1963. They next married another actor, Diana Scougall, in 1968, and the couple had a son, Michael (born 1969), before they were divorced in 1974. They married a third actor, Elizabeth Annear, that same year, and the couple had two daughters, Elisabeth Dermot Walsh (born 1974), themselves now an actor, and Olivia (born 1977). Elizabeth Annear died in 1993.

Dr. Cecile Reynaud is a volleyball educator and retired coach of the Florida State Lady Seminoles volleyball team. After their retirement from coaching they were an associate professor with the sport management program at Florida State University until August, 2015. They also served as an interim assistant athletic director and senior women's administrator at Florida State University from 1994-95. They have served as a television color analyst for collegiate volleyball matches on ACCN, Fox Sports Net South, Sunshine Network and ESPN.
They retired from coaching with over 650 wins.  They are a past president of the American Volleyball Coaches Association.  They are also a past chair of the board for USA Volleyball.
A 1975 graduate of Missouri State University, Reynaud enjoyed an outstanding athletic career on the volleyball team and was twice named among the Outstanding College Athletes in America. In 1983, they were inducted into the school's Women's Athletics Hall of Fame. Reynaud added "Dr." to their name in the spring of 1998 after completing their doctorate degree in athletic administration at Florida State.
Coaching
Florida State University
As a coach, Reynaud has surpassed many milestones in their 26-year tenure at Florida State. Coach Reynaud notched their 500th career victory in the first match of the 1994 season against Southern Illinois University, placing them among an elite list of coaches in the 500 win club. They reached win number 550 in a three-set win at Florida Atlantic University in 1997 as they led the Lady Seminoles to the program's best ever start at 12-0, and their 600th win over Clemson.
Post season play was familiar to the Lady Seminoles over 26 seasons of volleyball. Florida State (FSU) made 10 NCAA post-season appearances. At the conference level, FSU made three appearances in the Atlantic Coast Conference Championship game in eight years of ACC competition, earning FSU its first ACC crown in 1998. Prior to joining the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in 1992, Reynaud and the Lady Seminoles claimed six regular-season titles and five tournament titles in Metro Conference play from 1976 to 1991. Reynaud's teams have competed in 10 NCAA Tournaments, including eight post-season trips during their last 14 years in the position.
During their 26 years at Florida State, the volleyball program has also boasted one of the highest graduation rates within the athletic department. Among four-year letter winners, all but two student-athletes earned their college degrees while playing for Reynaud. This accounts for nearly 98 percent of all volleyball student-athletes over those 26 years. Reynaud's Seminoles also earned the prestigious Director's Cup for Service, given annually to the athletic team that performs the most community service hours. The Lady Seminoles donated 636 hours of service to the community in 2000-01.
After their retirement from coaching Dr. Reynaud joined the FSU Sport Management faculty in 2002 and served as the academic advisor for all the master's students and taught 3-4 classes a semester until 2015 when they retired from the University after 39 years. They continue to teach one online graduate class a semester as an adjunct professor.

In 1983, Reynaud went to the international level and served as the assistant coach at the World University Games in Canada and in 1985 was head coach for the USAV Junior National Team which toured Japan and China. In 2012, they served as the team leader for the USA Women's National Sitting Volleyball Team at the Paralympic Games.

In 2014 they served as the team leader for the Men's USA Volleyball Team at the U21 World Championship in Mexico.
They served as a coordinator at the Olympic Festival for several years and participated in the 1990 Goodwill Games as the Technical Secretary. Highly respected among their peers, Reynaud's involvement in international competition was taken to an even higher level when they were chosen to serve at the Deputy Competition Manager for the 1996 Centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia. As an expert of the game, Reynaud was co-editor of The Volleyball Coaching Bible, which has been heralded as one of the best volleyball coaching books to ever be written.  They are the editor of The Volleyball Coaching Bible, Vol. 2 published in June, 2015. They have produced numerous DVDs and other educational material pertaining to volleyball.
Reynaud is also a certified USA Volleyball Coaching Accreditation Program (CAP) instructor and conducts coaching clinics all over the United States. They also served as an FIVB Coach Clinician.
 They are a past member of the USA Volleyball Board of Directors and serves on the NORCECA Coaches Commission.
Memberships
They have been on the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) All-America Committee and was the Zone Coordinator for 1986 and 1987 Olympic Festivals. They continued to serve as the commissioner for the Olympic Festival for several years. Reynaud is spent 12 years on the USVBA Board of Directors and Executive Committee previously and is now serving a second time on the USA Volleyball Board of Directors.
Dr. Reynaud served as president of the AVCA in 1989 and 1990 after serving a two-year term as the awards chair in 1986 and 1987.

Cameron "Cammy" Glasgow (24 February 1966, Bridge of Allan) is a former Scotland international rugby union player.
Rugby Union career
Amateur career
They played for Howe of Fife. They helped the club win their own Sevens tournament in 1986, the first time since 1977. The Dundee Courier of 5 May 1986 reporting:
However, perhaps the biggest contribution was made by Cameron Glasgow in that for the first time in the sevens circuit Howe of Fife were able to call on genuine pace. The Scottish under-21 player had not been in the original seven. They were only in attendance for a team photograph and had intended returning to their residence in St Andrews to do some studying. They had scarcely, prepared themselves for such exertions in that the previous evening, throughout the night and that very breakfast, as is the custom, they had attended the University Ball. A Corinthian story, if ever there was one.
They left the Cupar club on that season end in 1986.
They played for University of St Andrews while a student there and won the Scottish Universities championship with the side in 1988, ending the Fife university's 25-year wait for another title.
They moved south to study at Cambridge University and they turned out for Cambridge University rugby union side.
They played for Edinburgh Wanderers.
They also played for Heriots.
Provincial career
They played for North and Midlands Under 21 side while still with Howe of Fife.
They played in the trial side for a place in the Midlands District side in 1987.
When Glasgow moved to Cambridge they turned out for the Anglo-Scots.

Tempoyak (Jawi: تمڤويق), asam durian or pekasam is a Malay condiment made from fermented durian. It is usually consumed by the ethnic Malays in Maritime Southeast Asia, notably in Indonesia and Malaysia. Tempoyak is made by taking the flesh of durian and mixing it with some salt and kept in room temperature for three or five days for fermentation. Tempoyaks are usually made during the durian season, when the abundance of durian and excess production are made into fermented tempoyak.
Tempoyak is not normally consumed solely, it is usually eaten as condiment or as an ingredient for cooking; such as cooked with coconut milk curry as gulai tempoyak ikan patin (pangasius fish tempoyak curry), or mixed with spicy chili pepper as sambal tempoyak.
Fermentation
In the Malay archipelago, fermented durian is known by many names. It is commonly known as tempoyak in the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, and Southern Sumatra region (South Sumatra, Jambi, Bengkulu and Lampung provinces). It is known as pekasam in Aceh and asam durian in the Minangkabau region of West Sumatra. The word asam which translates to "sour" describes its fermentation process.
Tempoyak is made by taking the flesh of durian and mixing it with salt or sugar. It is kept at room temperature and left to ferment for three to five days. As a fermented food, the tempoyak-making process involves a number of different lactic acid bacteria. Isolated lactic acid bacteria which form colonies in fermented durian are Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus subsp. fersantum. These lactic acid bacteria inhibit the growth of harmful decomposing bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, which in turn preserves the durian flesh. Besides its functions as a food preservative, fermented tempoyak also serves as a natural food flavoring. The addition of tempoyak into chili paste and curry can add a distinct aroma and savoury flavour to the dish.
History
Just like many fermented food products in the region (e.g. belacan, pekasam, cincalok, budu, and tapai), tempoyak was probably discovered unintentionally; from the excessive unconsumed durian and thus left fermented, during the abundance of durian season in the region.
Tempoyak is mentioned in Hikayat Abdullah as a staple food for the people of Terengganu. When Abdullah Abdul Kadir visit Terengganu around the year 1836, they said that one of the favorite food of the local resident is Tempoyak. Based on Hikayat Abdullah, tempoyak is a food special to the ethnic Malays, and a speciality of the states of the east coast of the Malay Peninsula. Temerloh in Pahang, Malaysia is known as the capital for ikan patin because of its fish farms and also its restaurants offering savoury ikan patin masak tempoyak (silver catfish cooked in fermented durian gravy).
In Indonesia, tempoyak is exceptionally popular in Southern Sumatra, especially in Palembang, where tempoyak ikan patin (pangasius fish in tempoyak sauce), and brengkes tempoyak (tempoyak fish in banana leaf package) is a popular local specialty.
Indonesia
In Indonesia, tempoyak is especially popular in Palembang, and also in other cities and provinces in Sumatra such as Riau, Jambi, Bengkulu, Lampung and also Pontianak in Kalimantan.
In Palembang the dish tempoyak ikan patin (Pangasius catfish in tempoyak sauce) and brengkes (pepes) tempoyak are well known, which is a steamed fermented durian paste in banana leaf container, usually mixed with patin (Pangasius fish) as brengkes ikan patin tempoyak. A spicy condiment called sambal tempoyak is made from the mixture of fermented durian, ground belacan (shrimp paste) and chili pepper.
In Lampung, tempoyak is made as sambal seruit tempoyak. Seruit is shredded fried freshwater fishes, such as patin (Pangasius), baung (Hemibagrus), lais (Kryptopterus), belida (Giant featherback) or mas (carp), mixed with ground chili pepper, tomato, shallot, shrimp paste, lime juice, young unripe mango, salt and tempoyak.
In Pontianak and Bengkulu, tempoyak is usually served as spicy condiment as sambal tempoyak, mixed with red chili pepper, fresh shrimp or teri (anchovy) and petai (green stinky bean).
Malaysia
In Malaysia, tempoyak is specifically popular in the state of Pahang and Perak, yet it is also can be found elsewhere, from Kuala Lumpur to Sarawak. In Malaysia, tempoyak is an essential ingredient for gulai tempoyak ikan patin (pangasius fish tempoyak curry) and for cooking soup with tang hoon or glass noodles. Temerloh in Pahang is known for farmed ikan patin (Shark catfish ) mostly the Swai a fish known for a popular traditional dish, patin masak tempoyak (cooked with fermented durian), and another local favorites such as pais patin (grilled with tempoyak) and deep-fried with chilies.
In Sarawak, tempoyak is available in the marketplace. The taste is said to be sour and salty with a lot of nutty, durian flavours.

Milan–Cortina d'Ampezzo 2026 (; or ) was a successful bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics by the cities of Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo and the Italian National Olympic Committee. The IOC selected Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo to host the 2026 Winter Olympics at the 134th IOC Session in Lausanne, Switzerland on 24 June 2019.
History
Considered Milan together with Valtellina as suitable candidates. The plan was for Milan to host the ice sports, while the snow sports would take place in Bormio, Santa Caterina di Valfurva and Livigno, which are already well-known destinations for Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, snowboarding, biathlon, etc.
On 10 March 2018, the mayor of Turin, Chiara Appendino, confirmed on their Facebook page that a bid to host the Games on the 20th anniversary of the 2006 Winter Olympics was being explored. They suggested that the bid would introduce a new, revolutionary model for hosting the Games, with sustainability at the forefront. On 17 March, Appendino sent a letter to CONI officially expressing their support, after having resolved an initial split in support amongst fellow council members. The following week, municipal council gave the green light to start the procedure for the establishment of a "Torino 2026" association. The not-for-profit entity will have the task of overseeing the analysis and research necessary to evaluate the feasibility of an eventual candidature of Turin to host the Winter Olympics.
On 29 March 2018, two days before the deadline for cities to join the dialogue stage, it was confirmed that CONI would bid to host the 2026 Games in Milan and Turin and a letter of intent had been sent to the IOC. The bid is complicated by the fact that the 134th IOC Session is scheduled to be held in Milan in 2019. If an Italian city proceeds to the candidature stage, the venue for the IOC session will need to be changed to a different country.
A decision on which city leads the potential Italian bid for the 2026 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games will be made on either 1 August or 17 September 2018. On 4 July 2018 the mayor of Turin, Chiara Appendino, announced in a conference the project and the candidacy for "Turin 2026", defining the opportunity of a double candidature with Milan "a chit-chat of the press I haven't seen yet". On 1 August 2018, CONI confirmed that all bidding cities will bid jointly using existing facilities and presented a proposal for a combined Cortina-Milan-Turin bid to CONI.
On 18 September 2018, the CONI announced it will present a bid with Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, excluding Turin after the city withdrew from the bid. On 19 September 2018, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said the Italian government would support a 2026 Winter Olympics bid. Furthermore, the CONI considered it would accept an eventual return of Turin in the Italian bid.
On 1 October 2018, the CONI confirmed the Milan–Cortina d'Ampezzo bid. Italian Government backs the Milan–Cortina bid for the 2026 Olympics, but will not make any financial investment. However, the regions of Lombardy and Veneto will try to finance the Games with private and public investments. On 21 January 2019 the Italian government supported the Milan–Cortina bid to host. On 1 April 2019 The referendum will not be needed because of many Italians support the candidature, 83 percent of Italians backed the bid. Milan–Cortina d'Ampezzo was chosen as host city, it will be the first Olympics to be held in Milan, mark the 20th anniversary of the 2006 Olympics in Turin, the 70th anniversary of the 1956 Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo and the 80th anniversary of the Italian Republic.
Previous bids
Milan had never hosted the Games; Cortina d'Ampezzo hosted the 1956 Winter Olympics.
Italy hosted the Games three times and made seventeen bids (nine for Summer Games and seven for the Winter Olympics).
Branding
The Candidate City logo was unveiled on 27 November 2018 during its presentation at the ANOC General Assembly in Tokyo, Japan. The logo of its candidature the bid logo is a stylised Milan Cathedral with a façade that turns into a mountain, echoing the Alps and the Dolomites. The logo's green, white and red spires reflect the Italian flag, with the design asserted to show the unity between Milan and Cortina.
The slogan "Dreaming Together" () was unveiled on 1 April 2019. The bid book and website was launched on 11 January 2019.
Dates
The Winter Olympic Games will be from 6 to 22 February 2026 and the Winter Paralympic Games will be from 6 to 15 March 2026.

Musuan Peak or Mount Musuan , also known as Mount Calayo (, literally "Fire Mountain") is an active volcano in Maramag, Bukidnon, on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. It is south of the city of Valencia, province of Bukidnon, and southeast of Cagayan de Oro City.
Physical characteristics
Musuan is a lava dome and tuff cone.
It has an elevation of asl, and a base diameter of .
Eruptions
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology reports that Musuan erupted in 1866 and 1867, but the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program records another eruption, possibly phreatic, that "burned everything around it." The explosion supposedly occurred four years before the 1891 visit of a Jesuit priest, who reported that they could not examine the volcano more closely because of strong solfataric activity.
A strong seismic swarm occurred near Musuan in 1976, and again around mid-2011.
Musuan is one of the active volcanoes in the Philippines, which are all part of the Pacific ring of fire.
Flora
Mount Musuan's northern slope is still covered by a primary rainforest. The rest is covered predominantly by Cogon grass (Imperata cylindrica). Reforestation efforts on the bare areas, both in tree-planting drives and by Central Mindanao University personnel, have established temporary forests of Acacia mangium and conifers.
There are 524 species of plants in Mount Musuan under 353 genera and 135 families. 301 species are trees, 51 shrubs, 50 grasses and sedges, 46 herbs, 42 vines, 31 ferns, and 3 fern allies. 188 species (35%) are economically important, 128 species (24%) are endemic, and 3 (1%) are endangered species. Musuan peak has approximately 6,354 individual trees. The most common tree species (in density and frequency) are the Melanolepis multiglandulosa (Kamala tree) and Colona serratifolia, followed by Clausena brevistyla and Alstonia scholaris (Blackboard tree). Three species of pteridophytes are locally threatened: Marsilea crenata ("apat-apat"), Ceratopteris thalictroides ("pakung-sungay"), and Lycopodiella cernua (clubmoss). 10 species of pteridophytes are endemic to the area.
History and Infrastructure
Mount Musuan's lack of any visible crater has led to some local skepticism of it being an active volcano. Still, the imagery evoked by its name variant 'Mount Calayo' (Fire Mountain) and the stories told by local Bukidnon tribesmen keeps people wary of the relatively small mountain which doesn't look like a volcano at all.
Valencia City is located North of the peak, the Central Mindanao University (CMU) and Barangay Dologon at the southwest, and the Pulangi River on the entire eastern side.
At the foot of Musuan Peak is the Mount Musuan Zoological and Botanical Garden of the Central Mindanao University. It includes a butterfly greenhouse and a reforestation nursery among its buildings. The Sayre Highway and a research center of the Philippine Carabao Center are located on the western slopes. It has a tourist shop which sells dairy products made from Carabao milk. South of the mountain are the university agricultural facilities including a cattle ranch, a poultry farm, greenhouses, and a dairy.
Due to its proximity to the university and the university town proper, it has become a popular destination for students, teachers, and tourists; either for picnics or a study of the flora and fauna of one of the few remnants of the jungles that once covered the valleys of the surrounding areas. From its isolated position in the middle of the valley and the very small surface area of its highest point (only a few meters), the entire countryside is visible from the top. Currently its slopes has been the target of extensive reforestation efforts partly paid for by the establishment of toll gates to hikers intending to go up the mountain.

Ariaeus (fl. 401–394 BC) was a Persian general who fought alongside Cyrus the Younger at the Battle of Cunaxa and later was involved in the assassination of Tissaphernes.
Life
Ariaeus appears in historic records in 401 BC, in Xenophon's description of the events leading up to the Battle of Cunaxa. Xenophon noted that they were a friend of Cyrus and was said to be fond of young boys, which was why they were an intimate of the young Thessalian general Menon.
At the Battle of Cunaxa they were Cyrus' second in command and commanded the left. According to Ctesias, they were alongside Cyrus, when Cyrus succeeded in wounding Artaxerxes, but this is unlikely. This would put them on the right alongside Cyrus, and Xenophon and Diodorus both agree they were on the left, which would have been some distance away.
As soon as Ariaeus discovered that Cyrus was slain in battle, they retreated with the surviving Persian troops. After the battle they offered to wait and return with the surviving Greek soldiers. Clearchus, speaking on behalf of the Greek soldiers, who considered themselves the victors in the battle, sent them a message to offer them the throne of Persia, but they declined. The Greeks then met up with Ariaeus and their Persian troops and they both agreed not to betray each other, and Ariaeus promised to lead them safely out of Persia.
Subsequently, Tissaphernes, promising Artaxerxes they would destroy the Greek troops entirely, persuaded the king to come to terms with Ariaeus, if Ariaeus would help betray the Greeks. Tissaphernes met with Ariaeus and persuaded them to join him, and Tissaphernes and Ariaeus led the Greeks to believe that they and Artaxerxes were willing to make peace with them and lead them to safety. Clearchus, Menon and three other generals (Agis of Arcadia, Socrates of Achaea and Proxenus of Boetia) along with 20 officers and some 200 troops later met with Tissaphernes on apparently cordial terms.
At a given signal, the officers and as many of the troops as could be caught were killed and all the generals were captured. They were then taken to Artaxerxes and killed. Some of the surviving soldiers found their way to the Greek encampment and, in response to their news, the remaining Greeks started preparing to attack the Persians. Ariaeus was immediately sent to assuage the Greeks. Ariaeus told the Greeks that only Clearchus has been killed, for reason of treachery, and tried to persuade them to lay down their arms, which the Greeks were reluctant to do. The surviving Greeks eventually decided to leave the camp and find their way out of Persia and return to Greece. Ariaeus joined Tissaphernes in an unsuccessful pursuit of the Greeks.
Ariaeus is next recorded in 395 BC when they were involved in the assassination of Tissaphernes. Diodorus refers to them as a satrap, which is probably a mistake, since they appeared to be reporting to Tissaphernes, who was the satrap of Sardis at that time. Artaxerxes grew angry with Tissaphernes' incompetence in their battles with the Greeks, perhaps even suspecting them of betrayal, and ordered their vizier Tithraustes to kill him. Ariaeus was ordered to assist. So Ariaeus invited Tissaphernes to visit them at their residence in Colossae in Phrygia to discuss important business. Tissaphernes was unsuspicious, leaving behind their bodyguard. When they arrived they set aside their sword and went into a bath. Ariaeus' men seized them there and sent them to Tithraustes by covered carriage, where they were soon after beheaded.
Tithraustes was given Tissaphernes' former satrapy of Sardis and when Tithraustes left to visit Artaxerxes in the late summer of 395 BC, they left Ariaeus and Passiphernes as generals in charge of Sardis. In the winter of 395-394 BC Ariaeus was visited there by Spithridates, who may have been trying to interest them in joining in rebellion against the king. Xenophon says that Spithridates put their trust in Ariaeus because they had already revolted against the king, which could have been a reference to Ariaeus' involvement in Cyrus the Younger's rebellion against Artaxerxes in 401 BC or perhaps may have suggested that Ariaeus was again in open rebellion.

The Dugan Glass Company was a decorative glass manufacturer based in Indiana, Pennsylvania. The company was in business from 1905 until 1913.
History
The Dugan glass company was founded by Thomas Dugan, a cousin of Harry Northwood. About 1904 Dugan along with their partner W. G. Minnemayer bought the closed Northwood factory in Indiana, PA and opened it as the Dugan glass company. The company continued production after the Dugans left the company and was renamed the Diamond glass company in 1913. The company continued production until a fire destroyed the plant on June 27, 1931.
Production

Maxim Stoyanov (; born June 29, 1987) is a Russian stage and film actor, known for their work in the 2019 American comedy drama Give Me Liberty.
Biography
Stoyanov was born in Tighina, in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, USSR (now Bender, under the control of Transnistria, which is internationally recognized as part of Moldova) into the family of a train machinist and a factory worker. They studied at the Moscow Art Theatre School under Konstantin Raikin, graduating in 2013.
Their first film role was in The Hope Factory, which premiered at the Rotterdam IFF.
Stoyanov garnered critical acclaim for their portrayal of Dima in Give Me Liberty. Justin Chang of The Los Angeles Times likened Stoyanov's character to “a walking mascot for the movie's big-heartedness; they may be the one character who, no matter how chaotic things get — and they get pretty chaotic — is delighted simply to be there.” “The movie's most big-hearted character is a Russian boxer named Dima played by Maxim Stoyanov with a boisterous charm that lights up their every scene.” Film Comment compared Stoyanov to a “muscle-bound young James Gandolfini”, whose character “has the eagerness of a large Alsatian puppy, and exudes the sort of undiluted force-of-nature comic charisma that filmmakers pray will miraculously fall out of the sky and into their cast.” Manohla Dargis of The New York Times placed “fantastic Max Stoyanov” in their 2020 list of Oscar-worthy performances.
In Russia, Stoyanov's work in Give Me Liberty also received critical and public acclaim.
Stoyanov has also appeared in the Russian TV series Shifr by Vera Storozheva and The Missing by Vadim Perelman.

Spelljammer: AD&D Adventures in Space is a 1989 boxed set accessory for the Spelljammer campaign setting, part of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. It supplies rules and materials for playing AD&D in space. The set was well received by critics and fans.
Contents
The Spelljammer boxed set describes rules for AD&D in outer space. The "Lorebook of the Void" booklet describes space travel, commonly known ship types, spacefaring races, and monsters. The "Concordance of Arcane Space" details fantasy combat, more rules for spaceships, celestial mechanics, travel, and variations on rules for space. The set includes cardstock sheets which provide both descriptions and deck plans for various ships, and counters for ship-to-ship combat. The set's large color maps depict two floating cities in space, a grid for space combat, and a map of the space between the planets of the Greyhawk, Forgotten Realms, and Dragonlance campaign settings, which allows player characters to travel between these settings. The set also includes guidelines for space campaigns, as well as campaign setting material.
The set details the Spelljammer helm, which any spellcasting character can use to pilot a ship through space. There are two kinds of outer space: "wildspace", which is similar to the outer space of science-fiction with some alterations to its physics, and the "phlogiston", an ocean of a unique element in which many vast crystal spheres float around. The set includes systems for designing starships and for celestial navigation, and visual displays representing planetary systems for design and space travel. It provides mechanics, counters, ship displays, and a map display for tactical engagements between spelljamming craft; the mechanics are explicitly designed to supplement role-playing, not as a stand-alone board game. The tactical engagement system includes 8½" × 11" cardstock displays for 11 types of spelljammer ships, with a color illustration of the ship and a summary of tactical combat features on one side, and deck plans with map keys on the reverse. The elves of the Spelljammer campaign are the largest political and military presence in space, having just completed a successful extermination of interstellar orcs and goblins throughout the known universe. Dwarves use huge spacefaring asteroids, honeycombed with tunnels. The lizard men and tinker gnomes (from the Dragonlance setting) are available as PCs; the beholder and the mind flayer appear as intergalactic menaces, along with a new race, the neogi. The set also contains color fold-out maps of the Spelljammer, a colossal manta-ray-shaped starship a quarter-mile long with a half-mile wingspan, and the Rock of Bral, an asteroid merchant and pirate port.
Publication history
Spelljammer was written by Jeff Grubb, with cover art by Jeff Easley and interior covers and illustrations by Jim Holloway, and was published by TSR in 1989 as a boxed set. The set included two 96-page softbound books, four full-color 22x34 map/displays, 20 color card-stock reference displays, and four colorful card-stock cut-out counter sheets.
Reception
In the January 1990 edition of Games International (Issue 12), James Wallis was not a fan of the set, finding inconsistencies in the combat rules, saying, "The cumulative effect of these inconsistencies is to make space combat unplayable." They did find the background "imaginative and consistent, but unfortunately there is little of it." Although they admired the production values of the components, they found the book disorganized to the point of "disarray and confusion." They concluded by giving the game a poor rating of only 2 out of 5, saying, "Spelljammer may score well physically but fails mentally [...] Scavenging AD&D players who enjoy stripping tasty ideas from the carcasses of dying games may find it of interest, but I cannot recommend it to anyone else."
Ken Rolston reviewed the Spelljammer supplement for Dragon magazine #154 (February 1990). According to Rolston, the color cover of the Concordance of Arcane Space booklet "is the perfect visual precis of the epic themes of the Spelljammer role-playing universe", with its depiction of a Spelljamming ship ("a combination of a Greek war galley, Jules Verne's Nautilus, and a mammoth exotic tropical fish") and "a swashbuckling, eye-patched fantasy pirate" with a wounded mind flayer lying at their feet. They call the gameplay physics "cheap-and-cheerful, tailor-made for swashbuckling AD&D fantasy action, with original and simple concepts that are also enormously flexible, with an appealing internal fantasy logic". The adventure and campaign potential for using the Spelljammer set "can only be measured in tons". Rolston compares the Spelljammer set to the Space: 1889 and Shadowrun games reviewed in the same column, stating that they are both "original and exciting, but they are likely to appeal to more experienced, sophisticated role-players" and "require mastery of unfamiliar game systems", but because Spelljammer is part of the AD&D game, "few new mechanics need to be mastered, and they're based on ever-so-familiar AD&D system conventions". Rolston concludes that "The Spelljammer set is a perfect evolution of the big, flexible, open-ended, and fun-loving elements of AD&D role-playing adventure. [...] The tone, objectives, and spirit are just right for its audience and purpose. The presentation is colorful and wonderfully imaginative" and "the rules and game concepts are simple, open-ended, and unpretentious, in keeping with the best traditions of AD&D role-playing, and remarkably comprehensive without intimidating in volume and detail." They write "The Spelljammer set is a gloriously silly idea executed with spirit and imagination."
The Spelljammer set was a Gamer's Choice award-winner.
In their 1991 book Heroic Worlds, Lawrence Schick describes the Spelljammer setting as seen in the boxed set: "forget about science, because this is fantasy space: there's a magical cosmology that creates strange planetary systems, bizarre spaceships that move by magical propulsion, and space zones where spells behave in strange ways".
DieHard GameFan said that "Spelljammer is just such a fun and fantastic idea and along with Planescape and Ravenloft, it remains one of my three big campaign settings for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons and is a big part of why 2e is my favorite version of D&D."

Quintus Pompeius was the name of various Romans from the gens Pompeia, who were of plebeian status. They lived during the Roman Republic and Roman Empire.
Consul of 141 BC
Quintus Pompeius A. f. (flourished 2nd century BC) was the son of an Aulus Pompeius. Little is known of their early life and political career.
The Roman Senator and Historian Cicero states that Pompeius first came to notice for their distinctive oratory. They were consul in 141 BC, during which, they were sent to Hispania as the successor of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus in command of the Numantine War. Although they defeated Tanginus, after several defeats they and their troops were kept encamped before the walls of the town during the winter. With many soldiers dying from the weather and illness, Pompeius feared that the Roman Senate would summon them to Rome to answer to them for their conduct of the war. So Pompeius decided to make peace with the Numantines.
Pompeius publicly demanded that the Numantines surrender; however, privately, they only demanded the return of the hostages and payment of thirty talents. The Numantines, at first, were wary of this arrangement; however, they eventually agreed to Pompeius' terms.
In 139 BC, Marcus Popillius Laenas arrived in Hispania to assume command from Pompeius, and discovered Pompeius' misconduct. Laenas then lodged a complaint against Pompeius in the Roman Senate. Pompeius continued with their lie during their hearing, but the senate voided their treaty with the Numantines and the war was renewed. Pompeius escaped punishment and was fortunate enough to obtain an acquittal when they were accused of extortion from the province they were governing in.
Pompeius was still popular among the Roman Plebs and was among the first plebeians, along with Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus, to be elected as censors. Pompeius' wife was an unnamed Roman woman. Their son was called Quintus Pompeius, an opponent of politician Tiberius Gracchus, and a daughter, Pompeia, who married a certain Gaius Sicinius.
Opponent of Tiberius Gracchus
Quintus Pompeius (flourished 2nd century BC), was the son to the above. In 133 BC, they were an opponent to politician Tiberius Gracchus.
Pompeius stated that they lived near Gracchus and knew a certain wealthy Greek, Eudemus from Pergamon, who gave Gracchus a purple robe and royal treasures including a diadem. Eudemus also promised Gracchus more treasures, when their tribuneship had expired. Pompeius was elected tribune of the plebs in 132 BC and opposed Gracchus' land reforms. Pompeius married an unnamed Roman woman and had two sons: Quintus Pompeius Rufus, consul of 88 BC and tribune Aulus Pompeius.
Note: This Quintus Pompeius above, consul in 141 and censor in 131, may have been the opponent of Gracchus.
Consul of 88 BC
Quintus Pompeius Rufus (flourished 2nd and 1st century BC, died 88 BC), was the son to the above and eldest brother to tribune Aulus Pompeius. They appear to be the first in their family to bear the cognomen Rufus. However, the origins of them gaining this cognomen are unknown - although it may simply be that they were red-haired.
Cicero states that Pompeius was among the orators they had heard in their youth. Pompeius was a supporter of the Dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla. In 100 BC Pompeius was tribune of the plebs; was praetor in 91 BC and served their consulship with Sulla in 88 BC. When the civil war broke out between Sulla and Gaius Marius, Pompeius was deprived of their consulship and fled to Nola, where Pompeius met up with Sulla and their army. Sulla took the place in the war against Mithridates and left Pompeius in charge of Italy.
While Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo was commanding the war against the Marsi tribe, the Optimates gave their army to Pompeius Rufus, the new consul. This caused Pompeius Rufus to be murdered by Strabo's soldiers.
Pompeius had married an unnamed Roman woman and they had a son a younger Quintus Pompeius Rufus, who married Sulla's first daughter Cornelia Sulla.
Son-in-law of dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla
Quintus Pompeius Rufus (flourished 2nd and 1st century BC, died 88 BC), was the son to the above. This Pompeius married Cornelia Sulla, the first daughter of dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Cornelia and Pompeius had two children a son Quintus Pompeius Rufus and a daughter Pompeia, who married the future dictator Gaius Julius Caesar as their second wife. This Pompeius was murdered in the Roman Forum in 88 BC, by the supporters of politician Gaius Marius.
Son of tribune Aulus Pompeius
Quintus Pompeius Bithynicus (108 BC-48 BC), was the son of the tribune Aulus Pompeius.  They are the first member of the family to bear the cognomen Bithynicus. However, the origins of them gaining this cognomen are unknown.
Pompeius was a friend to Cicero, with whom they studied. Cicero considered this Pompeius as a great learner, who was an average orator. When the civil war broke out between Pompey and Julius Caesar, Pompeius supported Pompey. After the battle at Pharsalia Greece, they fled with Pompey, along with Pompey's remaining supporters in Egypt. On their arrival to Egypt, they were killed on the orders of Greek Pharaoh of Egypt Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator. Pompeius married an unnamed woman and they had a son Aulus Pompeius Bithynicus.
Grandson of dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla
Quintus Pompeius Rufus (flourished 1st century BC) was the son of Quintus Pompeius Rufus, who was murdered in 88 BC, and Cornelia Sulla. Their maternal grandparents were the dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla and their first wife Ilia (or Julia). Their paternal grandfather was the consul of 88 BC, Quintus Pompeius Rufus, while their paternal grandmother is unknown.
In 54 BC, they were accused by Marcus Valerius Messalla Rufus of bribing voters to gain the consulship. They were tribune of the plebs in 52 BC and was a supporter of triumvir Pompey.
Marcus Caelius Rufus accused Pompeius of violating laws of the Roman Senate which they had taken an active role in passing. They were condemned and was exiled to Campania. Also Caelius accused Pompeius of forcing their mother to give them the property that belonged to their father. The last instance in which the sources mention Pompeius is that in 51 BC the enemies of Pompeius spread false rumours that Pompeius murdered Cicero on their way to Cilicia.
Praetor of 63 BC
Quintus Pompeius Rufus (flourished 1st century BC) was a praetor in 63 BC. It is unknown how this Pompeius was related to the above named. In 62 BC, they went to Capua, in fear of the supporters of politician Catiline.
Pompeius was the governor of the African Province in 61 BC, where they obtained the title of Proconsul and Cicero states they governed with integrity. In 56 BC, they bore witness to Marcus Caelius Rufus, who was in Africa at that time.

The Church Park Historic District is a historic district and part of downtown Goshen, the seat of Orange County, New York, United States. It takes its name from the large triangular park formed at the center of the village by Main Street (NY 207), Park Place and South Church Street. It is defined as bounded by Green Street on the south, Main Street, Webster Avenue, and then back across Main at Erie Street across the Historic Track to Kelsey Lane, South Church Street, South Street and back to Green. There are 107 buildings and three objects within the district.
At the north end of the triangle are First Presbyterian Church, whose distinctive spire dominates the village's skyline, giving the district its name. It was first designated when added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 as bounded by Park, Main and Webster. In 2004 it was expanded to its current boundaries.
The village designated the area an Architectural Design District a few years after the district was added to the Register. This provides for review of design elements for any new construction within its boundaries to ensure that they conform to its historic character, which stands as a stark contrast to the brutalist, Paul Rudolph-designed Orange County Government Center to the north of the district. Most of the properties within are either churches, county government buildings or professional offices, with residential uses taking up the side streets. There is some retail along the west side of Main Street near the southwestern corner of the district, where it abuts Goshen's main downtown shopping district.
Significant contributing properties
The district's 1,020 acres (4 km²) includes three contributing properties that are Registered Historic Places in their own right. Foremost among them is the Historic Track, a National Historic Landmark where harness racing has taken place since 1838, making it the oldest continuously operated horse racing facility in the U.S. In front of it, on Main Street near the north end of the district, is the Tudor Revival Harness Racing Museum & Hall of Fame. Facing the church from across Main is the county's 1841 courthouse, a magnificent Greek Revival structure designed by popular local architect Thornton Niven.
Just north of the church is Orange County's 1887 government building, and in the middle of the intersection of Main and Park is a Theo Alice Ruggles Kitson statue commemorating the "Orange Blossoms", a locally raised regiment that fought with distinction in the Civil War. The Goshen United Methodist Church, almost as tall as its neighbor, adjoins the old courthouse.
At the corner of Park and South Church, another monument remembers the village's sacrifice during the Revolutionary War. A granite obelisk marks the mass grave of the local militiamen who died in the disastrous Battle of Minisink. It took 43 years for locals to make the trip to the battle site and retrieve what bones they could.
Main Street to the north of the intersection is wide and lined with historic buildings on both sides. They include a house from which President Ulysses S. Grant watched the horse races in 1873 and the early 20th-century school building which now serves as main offices for the Goshen Central School District.

Hazimism, also referred to as the Hazimi movement or known as the hazimiyyah or Hazimi current, is an extremist strand of Wahhabism based on the teachings of the Saudi-born Muslim scholar Ahmad ibn Umar al-Hazimi. Hazimis believe that those who do not unconditionally excommunicate (takfir) unbelievers are themselves unbelievers, which opponents argue leads to an unending chain of takfir." . Its spread within ISIS triggered prolonged ideological conflict within the group, pitting its followers against the moderate faction led by Turki al-Binali. The movement was eventually branded as extremist by ISIS, who initiated a crackdown on its followers.
Beliefs
Contemporary Salafi-Jihadi movements base their beliefs on the teachings of theologians such as Ibn Taymiyyah and Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. However, al-Hazimi asserted that the doctrines put forward by contemporary Salafi-Jihadi thinkers were not to be blindly followed; challenging the consensual authority of Ibn Taymiyyah. This outlook would completely shake the ideological foundations of the Salafi-Jihadi movement. Hazimi's doctrines were also highly influenced by the doctrines of the Egyptian militant Islamist ideologue Sayyid Qutb.
Central to Hazimism is the doctrine of takfir al-‘adhir ("excommunication of the excuser"). Wahhabi movement regards the Takfir (religious excommunication) of polytheists as a duty. As per the third "nullifier" in their treatise Nullifiers of Islam, Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab writes that those who do not takfir polytheists are themselves, unbelievers, whether that is because they doubt their disbelief or otherwise. The crux of the dispute between Hazimis and Salafis, Wahhabis, Jihadis, ISIS, etc. was over the concept known as al-‘udhr bi'l-jahl (i.e, “excusing on the basis of ignorance") a belief which the Jihadis consider as a restraint on excessive takfir. To justify their claims, various Hazimi ideologues assert that Ibn Taymiyyah was against the principle of al-‘udhr bi'l-jahl in affairs of shirk (polytheism). Al-Hazimi categorically rejects al-‘udhr bi'l-jahl for matters they consider to be of "greater polytheism" (al-shirk al-akbar) and "greater disbelief" (al-kufr al-akbar), such as voting in elections, supplicating to the dead, etc. In these scenarios, al-Hazimi states that those who refuse to pronounce takfir by citing al-‘udhr bi'l-jahl are unbelievers as per the third nullifier. Although not affiliated to jihadists himself, al-Hazimi's views influenced a number of jihadists who went on to join the Daesh. These fringe elements within ISIS who adopted Hazimi's doctrines came to be known as “the Hazimis” (al-Hazimiyya, al-Hazimiyyun).
History
Al-Hazimi in Tunisia
Between December 2011 and May 2012, Al-Hazimi delivered four lectures in Tunisia. They were supported by the Islamic Good Society and Hay al-Khadra' Mosques Committee. While the members of the former were arrested for financing terrorism, the latter had maintained links to Ansar al-Sharia in Tunisia (AST). With the aid of the committee, al-Hazimi founded the Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani Institute for Sharia Sciences, which promoted their teachings. Their views were also amplified through AST's Facebook page.
Hazimism in ISIS
In the following years, several Tunisians who adopted al-Hazimi's views joined ISIS. During the group's infighting with the Al-Nusra Front, the Tunisians remained loyal and were rewarded with senior administrative and religious posts. With increasing influence, however, their belief in takfir al-‘adhir (excommunication of the excuser) became a source of concern for Daesh leadership. Bahraini scholar Turki al-Binali, who led the group's Office of Research and Studies, prepared a series of lectures and pamphlets against the doctrine. They argued that while al-‘udhr bi'l-jahl was invalid in instances of greater polytheism and disbelief, this does not necessarily mean that those who make excuses are disbelievers. In a tweet, they also described the belief as bidʻah (religious innovation). The Binalis, as they were later termed, also claimed the Hazimi view led to an "infinite regress of takfir" (al-takfir bi'l-tasalsul).
In March 2014, audio leaked of several high-level Hazimi officials; including the wāli of Hasakah, pronouncing takfir on the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. A separate leak showed takfir being made on Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. In late 2014, 50 Hazimis fled to Turkey while 70 were imprisoned and executed by ISIS after they made takfir on elements of its leadership which did not consider Ayman al-Zawahiri to be a disbeliever. Following their arrest, a pro-Hazimi statement surfaced describing ISIS as a "kafir jahmiyyah state". Several Hazimi cells were formed afterwards; the breakup of one in Raqqa being featured in Dabiq where they were branded as kharijites. Despite the crackdown, several groups of Hazimis remained, including one led by a certain Abu Ayyub al-Tunisi and supported by the wāli (governor) of Aleppo. In 2016, Hazimis clashed with ISIS in the vicinity of Al-Bab and Jarabulus. In an account of the incident, senior Hazimi Abu Muath al-Jazairi called ISIS the "Idols' State" and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the "taghut" of Syria.
In a statement published in Al-Naba in April 2017, ISIS' Central Office for Overseeing the Sharia Departments banned the discussion of al-‘udhr bi'l-jahl and takfir al-‘adhir, but warned that hesitation in takfir was inexcusable. On 17 May 2017, ISIS' Delegated Committee issued a memorandum which condemned al-takfir bi'l-tasalsul but stated that takfir was from the "foundations of the religion", rebuking those who hesitate in making it and branding them as murji'ah. Shortly afterwards, al-Binali published a response to the memorandum and claimed its intent was to placate the Hazimis. On May 31, al-Binali was killed in a coalition airstrike, followed by two other scholars who supported him. The timing was seen as suspicious by the Binalis, who accused the Delegated Committee of leaking their locations. In September 2017, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi reportedly dismissed and detained several Hazimis, reshuffling the Delegated Committee.
In 2019, Hazimi foreign fighters, including a large contingent of Tunisians, failed a two-day coup attempt against al-Baghdadi. ISIS alleged they were led by Abu Muath al-Jazairi and placed a bounty on him.
Post-ISIS
In June 2020, it was estimated there were over 100 Hazimis in the Netherlands.

The Linux Trace Toolkit (LTT) is a set of tools that is designed to log program execution details from a patched Linux kernel and then perform various analyses on them, using console-based and graphical tools. LTT has been mostly superseded by its successor LTTng (Linux Trace Toolkit Next Generation).
LTT allows the user to see in-depth information about the processes that were running during the trace period, including when context switches occurred, how long the processes were blocked for, and how much time the processes spent executing vs. how much time the processes were blocked. The data is logged to a text file and various console-based and graphical (GTK+) tools are provided for interpreting that data.
In order to do data collection, LTT requires a patched Linux kernel. The authors of LTT claim that the performance hit for a patched kernel compared to a regular kernel is minimal; Their testing has reportedly shown that this is less than 2.5% on a "normal use" system (measured using batches of kernel makes) and less than 5% on a file I/O intensive system (measured using batches of tar).
Usage
Collecting trace data
Data collection is Started by:
trace 15 foos
This command will cause the LTT tracedaemon to do a trace that lasts for 15 seconds, writing trace data to foo.trace and process information from the /proc filesystem to foo.proc.
The trace command is actually a script which runs the program tracedaemon with some common options. It is possible to run tracedaemon directly and in that case, the user can use a number of command-line options to control the data which is collected. For the complete list of options supported by tracedaemon, see the online manual page for tracedaemon.
Viewing the results
Viewing the results of a trace can be accomplished with:
traceview foo
This command will launch a graphical (GTK+) traceview tool that will read from foo.trace and foo.proc. This tool can show information in various interesting ways, including Event Graph, Process Analysis, and Raw Trace. The Event Graph is perhaps the most interesting view, showing the exact timing of events like page faults, interrupts, and context switches, in a simple graphical way.
The traceview command is a wrapper for a program called tracevisualizer. For the complete list of options supported by tracevisualizer, see the online manual page for tracevisualizer.

Cygnus-X is a massive star formation region located in the constellation of Cygnus at a distance from the Sun of 1.4 kiloparsecs (4,600 light years).
As it is located behind the Cygnus Rift and its light is heavily absorbed by the Milky Way's interstellar dust, it is better studied in other wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum that penetrate it such as the infrared.
Physical properties
As studies done with the help of the Spitzer Space Telescope have shown, Cygnus-X has a size of 200 parsecs and contains the largest number of massive protostars as well as the largest stellar association (Cygnus OB2, with up to 2,600 stars of spectral type OB and a mass of up to 105 solar masses) within a radius of 2 kiloparsecs of the Sun. It is also associated with one of the largest molecular clouds known, with a mass of 3 million solar masses. Its stellar population includes a large number of early-type stars as well as evolved massive stars such as luminous blue variable candidates, Wolf–Rayet stars, and supergiant stars of spectral types O and B.
Ongoing research has shown Cygnus X includes two stellar associations: Cygnus OB2 and Cygnus OB9 as well as an additional large number of early-type stars that include BD+40°4210, a blue supergiant star and luminous blue variable candidate that is one of the brightest stars of the association, as well as more supergiant stars of spectral types O and B. The same study shows that star formation has been taking place there during at least 10 million years, continuing to the present day.

Watford Football Club are an English football club, from Watford, Hertfordshire. Founded in 1881 as Watford Rovers, the club has competed in the Football League since 1920 and since the 2015–16 season have competed in the Premier League. First introduced by the Watford Observer in the 1972–73 season, the Watford F.C. Player of the Season award is voted for annually by supporters of the club. It recognises the best overall performance by an individual player through the season. Winners were originally presented with the Watford Observer Trophy, but since 2016–17 the award has been named the Graham Taylor Player of the Season Award, after the club's former manager.
Goalkeeper Andy Rankin won the initial award in the 1972–73 season, ahead of Colin Franks and Duncan Welbourne. In the 1974–75 season, Rankin won the award for the second time, becoming the first of ten players to do so as of 2016. Another goalkeeper, Tony Coton, is the only player to have received the title for a third time. Coton is one of four players to have won the award in consecutive seasons, the others being Wilf Rostron in 1982–83 and 1983–84, Tommy Smith in 2007–08 and 2008–09, and most recently, Troy Deeney in 2013–14 and 2014–15. Eight winners of the award have represented their country at full international level, of whom only John McClelland went on to become Watford's Player of the Season for a second time.
Towards the end of each season, fans vote directly for the Player of the Season. Historically this has been conducted by post, but in recent years it has taken place on the Watford Observer's website. This system was earmarked for change to a match-by-match rating system in 2009, but in March 2010, the Observer decided to revert to the traditional method of voting.

The Fee Building, is a historic commercial building in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. It was built and designed in 1935, by master builder Michael J. Murphy as a mixed-use retail shop and residence. It is an example of a Spanish Colonial Revival architecture style building. The structure is recognized as an important commercial building in the city's Downtown Conservation District Historic Property Survey, and was nominated and submitted to the California Register of Historical Resources on February 21, 2003. The building is now occupied by the Coldwell Banker real estate agency and the Belle Cose clothing and jewelry store.
History
The Fee Building was established for owner William P. Fee, in 1935 as a mixed-use retail shop and residence, located on Ocean Avenue and Lincoln Street in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, next to the Harrison Memorial Library. The construction cost in 1935 was $8,000 (). It is a two-story wood-frame, concrete, stucco Spanish Colonial-style building with an intersecting Spanish tiled roof. The ground level on Ocean Avenue has an arched entrance and shop windows for a retail business. The upstairs apartment has multi-pane French doors that leads to the living room, and an open terrace with wrought iron railings. There are two chimneys that can be seen from the upstair apartment and copper gutters and downspouts.
M. J. Murphy, Inc. designed and constructed the Fee Building and J. Weaver Kitchen did the original modern plumbing and fixtures that was part of the construction. Jack Belvail & Sons did the lighting and electrical work for the new property. Major W. J. Hairs reopened the Merle's Treasure Chest in 1936, with jewelry and antiques collected from their travels. Another tenant was Joe's Taxi Service, which had a fleet of Packard cars, and Paul's Barber shop.
Several additions and remodeling's took place over the years. In 1940, the upstairs rear addition was designed by Robert Jones for $750 (). In 1944, Hugh W. Comstock remodeled the front with glass windows for $242 (). In 1957, the interior portion was changed by J. B. Pratessa for $4000 ().
The building qualified for inclusion in the city's Downtown Conservation District Historic Property Survey, and has been nominated and submitted to the California Register of Historical Resources on February 21, 2003. The property is significant under the California Register criterion 3, in the area of architecture as an example of Spanish Colonial Revival style and designed by master builder Michael J. Murphy. Developer Samuel Finley Brown Morse made use of this style for houses built in Pebble Beach, California, and the style was used in downtown Carmel in the late 1920s and 1930s.
William P. Fee
William Parker Fee (1869-1938) was born on August 3, 1869, from Belfast, Northern Ireland. Their father was William P. Fee (1830-1908) and mother was Jeanette Parker (1840-1903). They had a daughter, Doris Parker Fee (1906-1997), and sister Jennie Klink both of Big Sur; and a sister Mima McCormack of Belfast; and a brother, Robert Andres Fee (1869-1941), of New York City. Their wife, Mabel Edith Fee (1876-1928), was from Guernsey, England. They died in Carmel on October 28, 1928 at the age of 52.
Parker lived in Carmel for 5 years before moving to the Ripplewood Resort at Big Sur, California. On January 23, 1926, Mary E. Hand, president of the Carmel Arts and Crafts Club, and their husband transferred a real estate deed to Lot 6 and east 25 feet lot 10, Blk. 72 in Carmel to Fee for $10 ().
Fee died, at age 68, on January 21, 1938, in a Monterey Peninsula hospital. Funeral services were held by the Pacific Grove, California Masonic lodge at the Dormey Funeral Home. Rev. S. C. Potter was the minister at the service. Fee was buried at the El Carmelo Cemetery in Pacific Grove.

Pal (June 4, 1940 – June 18, 1958) was a male Rough Collie performer and the first in a line of such dogs to portray the fictional female collie Lassie in film, on radio, and on television. Pal was born in California in 1940 and eventually brought to the notice of Rudd Weatherwax, a Hollywood animal trainer. In 1943, the dog was chosen to play Lassie in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer feature film Lassie Come Home. Following their film debut, Pal starred in six more Lassie films for MGM from the mid-1940s to early 1950s, then appeared briefly in shows, fairs, and rodeos around the United States before starring in the two pilots filmed in 1954 for the television series, Lassie. Pal retired after filming the television pilots, and died in June 1958. They sired a line of descendants who continued to play the fictional character they originated. In 1992, The Saturday Evening Post said Pal had "the most spectacular canine career in film history".
Birth and early years
Pal was born at Cherry Osborne's Glamis Kennels in North Hollywood on June 4, 1940. The son of Red Brucie of Glamis and Bright Bauble of Glamis, Pal's ancestry is traced to the nineteenth century and England's first great collie, "Old Cockie". Because of their large eyes and the white blaze on their forehead, Pal was judged not of the highest standards and sold as a pet-quality dog.
Howard Peck, an animal trainer, brought the eight-month-old collie to Hollywood animal trainer Rudd Weatherwax in order to break the animal of uncontrolled barking and a habit of chasing motorcycles. After working with the dog, Weatherwax gained control of the barking but was unable to break Pal of their motorcycle-chasing habit. Peck was disappointed with the results and gave the dog to Weatherwax in exchange for the money Peck owed him. Weatherwax, in turn, gave the dog to a friend, but when they learned that Eric Knight's 1940 novel, Lassie Come-Home, was being considered as a feature film by MGM, Weatherwax sensed Pal was the dog to fill the role, and bought Pal back from their friend for $10 USD. Peck later tried to reclaim them after they became famous as Lassie, but Weatherwax's legal ownership was upheld. Rudd's brother Frank Weatherwax, who trained dogs for such films as The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T and The Wizard of Oz, assisted Rudd in training Pal.
MGM films
The first MGM "Lassie" film was planned as a low budget, black and white children's film. Pal was among 1,500 dogs who auditioned for the title role, but was rejected because they were male, their eyes were too big, their head too flat, and a white blaze ran down their forehead. A female prize-winning show collie was hired to play the title character. Weatherwax was hired to train the star, and Pal was hired as a stunt dog.
During the course of filming, a decision was made to take advantage of a massive flooding of the San Joaquin River in central California in order to obtain some spectacular footage for the film. The female collie was still in training and refused to enter the raging waters created by the flood. Weatherwax was on the site with Pal and offered to have their dog perform in a five-stage shot in which Pal would swim the river, haul themselves out, lie down without shaking the water off their coat, attempt to crawl while lying on their side and finally lie motionless, completely exhausted. Pal performed exceptionally well and the scene was completed in one take. Weatherwax said director Fred M. Wilcox was so impressed with Pal during the sequence that they had "tears in their eyes." In response, producers released the female collie and hired Pal in their stead, reshooting the first six weeks of the filming with Pal now portraying Lassie. Other sources say that the female collie was replaced because they began to shed excessively during shooting of the film in the summer, resulting in Weatherwax substituting the male collie, Pal, in the role of "Lassie". In any case, MGM executives were so impressed, they upgraded the production to an A film with full advertising support, top publicity and filming in Technicolor. Pal went through their paces with enthusiasm, rarely required multiple retakes, and did their own stunt work.
Pal's success in Lassie Come Home in 1943 led to six more MGM films: Son of Lassie (a sequel to Lassie Come Home), Courage of Lassie, Hills of Home, The Sun Comes Up, Challenge to Lassie, and The Painted Hills. In their earlier years with MGM, Rudd Weatherwax was assisted by Frank Inn, who, for fourteen years, trained Lassies and later supplied animals for the 1954 Lassie television series.
Following The Painted Hills in 1951, MGM executives felt Lassie had run their course and planned no future films featuring the character. MGM executives then sought a way to break Weatherwax's contract. Weatherwax was concerned about protecting Pal and the Lassie image they had created from future diminishment at the hands of others. In lieu of US$40,000 in back pay owed them by the studio, Weatherwax bargained for and received the Lassie name and trademark.
Television series
Following their departure from MGM, Pal and Weatherwax went on the road performing an 18-minute program at dog shows and department stores. Television producer Robert Maxwell convinced Weatherwax that Pal's future lay in television. Together, the men created a boy-and-his-dog scenario about a struggling family on a weatherbeaten farm in Middle America.
The field for the role of the boy in Lassie was narrowed to three young actors, but the final decision was left to Pal. After spending a week with the boys at Weatherwax's North Hollywood home, Pal seemed to like eleven-year-old Tommy Rettig more than the other two. Rettig won the role based on Pal's response, and filming for the two pilots began in the summer of 1954, with Pal portraying Lassie in both.
After viewing the pilots, CBS executives immediately signed the 30-minute show to its fall 1954 schedule. Pal retired after filming the two pilots, and their son, Lassie Junior (who was three years old and had been in training for a couple of years), stepped into the television role. Pal would come to the show's studio home at Stage One of KTTV in Los Angeles every day with their son during filming. They had a bed behind the set, and was respectfully termed The Old Man. Series star Tommy Rettig later recalled, "When Rudd would ask Lassie, Jr. to do something, if you were behind the set, you could see The Old Man get up from their bed and go through the routine back there."
Death
By 1957, Pal was growing blind, deaf, and stiff, and rarely visited the Lassie set. The star of the show Jon Provost later recalled, "As young as I was, I recognized how much that dog meant to Rudd. Rudd loved that old dog as much as anyone could love an animal or person."
Pal died of natural causes in June 1958 at age 18, which is about 85 in "dog years" for their Rough Collie breed; and for months Weatherwax slipped in and out of deep depression. Robert Weatherwax, Rudd's son, later recalled, "It hit them very hard when Pal died. They buried them in a special place on the ranch and would often visit the grave. Dad would never again watch an MGM Lassie movie. They just couldn't bear to see Pal. They didn't want to have to be reminded of just how much they loved that dog."
Legacy
In 1950, Rudd Weatherwax and co-author John H. Rothwell co-wrote a book about Pal's life called The Story of Lassie: Their Discovery and Training from Puppyhood to Stardom.
Several descendants of Pal played the fictional Lassie character following their progenitor's death. On the original television series (1954–73), Pal's son, Lassie Junior, and their grandsons, Spook and Baby, worked the first several seasons. Mire appeared in a few of the Ranger seasons, and Hey Hey worked the final two syndicated seasons.
The casting of non-Pal bloodline collies in the role of Lassie has met with protest. In 1997, a Lassie television series debuted on the Animal Planet network but without a Weatherwax-trained dog as Lassie. A protest campaign was waged, and producers brought a ninth generation Weatherwax dog to the show. The 2005–2006 remake of the original Lassie movie provoked comment when a non-Pal bloodline collie was cast in the title role. Robert Weatherwax has disputed the casting of non-Pal bloodline dogs in the role of Lassie.
In 2000 the Lassie trademark was sold by the eight remaining members of the Weatherwax family to Classic Media (which in 2012, Classic Media was acquired by DreamWorks Animation and renamed into DreamWorks Classics and ultimately became the property of trademarks' current owners, Universal Studios as of 2016). In 2004 Robert Weatherwax's personal contract to supply a dog to play the role of Lassie ended and neither side pursued a renewal. After several years of stand-in collies that were not related to the line, Classic Media contracted with Carol Riggins, who had been co-trainer with Robert Weatherwax, and their 9th generation dog HeyHey, who had played the role of Lassie during the last 13 episodes of the Canada Lassie series under the Weatherwax Trained Dogs banner. Carol Riggins continues today as the official owner and trainer of Lassie with another "Pal", a 10th generation direct descendant of the original Pal.

ZF AS Tronic is an automated manual transmission made by ZF Friedrichshafen for the motorcoach and lorry market in Europe and North America which was first introduced in 2003.
As it is in part a manual transmission, it lacks the torque converter that is standard on automatic transmissions-an AS Tronic has been quoted as being 500 pounds less than the B500. Some coach operators are choosing this transmission for better fuel economy over automatics.
This transmission is offered as a 6-speed(called AS Tronic Lite by ZF), 10-speed 12-speed or 16-speed transmission.

Georges Armand Deschamps (October 18, 1911 — June 20, 1998) was a French American engineer and Professor Emeritus at the Department of Electrical Engineering at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  They are best known for their contributions to electromagnetic theory, microwave engineering and antenna theory.  They are also regarded as an early pioneer of microstrip and patch antennas, which they proposed in 1953.
Biography
Born on October 18, 1911 in Vendôme, France, Deschamps was raised in Normandy. They were admitted to École normale supérieure in Paris in 1931, where they studied mathematics and was a classmate of Georges Pompidou, former President of France. They further received advanced degrees in physics and mathematics from University of Paris, Sorbonne. Initially planning to study topology with Eduard Čech at Masaryk University, they eventually went to Princeton University as a research associate for a year in 1937. Following this, they taught mathematics and physics at Lycée Français de New York. In the meantime, with the advent of World War II, they were enlisted to French Army and worked as an engineer for Maginot Line. Following the Battle of France in 1940, they escaped through North Africa and returned to the United States in 1941 to resume their teaching duties.
In 1947, Deschamps joined Federal Telecommunications Laboratories of ITT Inc. as a project engineer, where they worked on radio navigation and antenna design. In 1958, they joined University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as the director of the Antenna Laboratory, following the departure of the previous director, Victor H. Rumsey. The research work of the laboratory during this period focused on frequency independent antennas. In 1978, they were elected to the National Academy of Engineering for "his contributions to electromagnetic scattering, microwave engineering, and laser beam propagation." Being a Life Fellow of IEEE, they were a recipient of IEEE Centennial Medal (1984) and IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society Distinguished Achievement Award (1987). They retired from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1982.
Deschamps died on June 20, 1998; they were survived by their wife Bunty, three children and five grandchildren.
Research
Deschamps's research focused on electromagnetic theory and its applications in antenna and microwave engineering. In 1953, they proposed the concept of patch antenna concept at a United States Air Force Antenna Symposium, these antennas were eventually popularized and realized in the 1970s. Their main research work at their tenure at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign included ray theory of electromagnetics, high-frequency asymptotics and complex point source representations of Gaussian beams, last of which they introduced. They also worked on the applications of differential forms to electromagnetics and focused primarily on the subject following their retirement.

Isaac Hughes (1798 – 23 June 1870) was a British Calvinist missionary and preacher. They were born to Welsh parents Edward and Mary Hughes in Manchester. Their father came from Bontuchel in Denbighshire and their mother came from Brynsiencyn in Anglesey. After some time in Sheffield and Rotherham, they married Elizabeth Jones from Llangollen on 18 August 1823 and departed Britain a month later on 24 September on a ship from Gravesend, arriving in Cape Town, South Africa on 30 December. They initially worked as a blacksmith, reaching Kuruman in August 1824 and Griquatown in late 1827, also working in Lattakoo and Graham's Town. In 1839 they became a missionary. In 1845 they worked along the Vaal River and opened a new station in Backhouse, which later developed into the town Douglas. After their wife died they remarried a missionary's daughter, Anne Magdalena Vogelgezang, in 1850. They died on 23 June 1870 after a 47-year career.

There have been Sikhs in the United States military since World War I. Sikhs and Sikh Americans have served through all subsequent wars until the present day. Since the 1980s, observant Sikhs have faced difficulty in serving due to a discontinuation of exemptions to uniform standards which previously allowed Sikhs to maintain their religiously-mandated beards and turbans while in uniform.
World War I and World War II
One of the earliest Sikh soldiers in the American military was Bhagat Singh Thind, who although not a U.S. citizen enlisted in the United States Army and served in World War I. Bhagat Singh Thind was the first Sikh in US military service to be granted the right to wear a turban while on active duty in the US Army. Thind requested citizenship at the end of the war, but was refused. They were granted citizenship in 1936. Sikh participation as a part of U.S. forces in World War I was limited due to their small population in the country, but 138,000 Sikhs served in other Allied forces. Large numbers of Sikhs served in U.S. forces during World War II, and all American wars following.
During World War II Sikh units of the Indian and Commonwealth forces served under Allied command alongside or in cooperation with American forces and earned a reputation for bravery, serving notably against the Germans and Italians in East Africa, North Africa, Italy, France, Western Europe and against the Japanese in the China-Burma-India Theater. Notable actions involving Sikhs fighting alongside American forces occurred at the Battle of Monte Cassino and the assault on the Gustav Line during the Italian Campaign where both American and Indian Army Sikh (as well as Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, Polish and South African) units suffered heavy casualties. Other notable battles of World War II that involved units composed of Sikhs included both the First and Second Battles of El Alamein, Kohima, Imphal, and the Burma campaign in conjunction with Merrill's Marauders.
Restrictions due to uniform regulations
Prior to the 1980s—and from the time of Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo Zumwalt's "Z-grams" numbers 57 and 70, in early November 1970 and late January 1971 respectively, permitting their presence on all United States Navy personnel until the timeframe of Ronald Reagan's presidency—the United States Armed Forces allowed beards while in uniform. However, due to a change in regulations, the U.S. Armed Forces rescinded permission for beards in uniform, except for those who commenced their service in the military before 1986. As the beard is a requirement according to the Rehat Maryada, the current regulation has created a regulatory barrier that has kept observant Sikh men from serving in the United States Armed Forces in large numbers. Retired Colonel GB Singh, applied to serve in the U.S. Army in 1979. Although there had been Sikhs who had enlisted in the U.S. Military previously, Singh was the first to go the officer route. A periodontist, Singh served in the U.S. Army as a colonel, one of a small number of Sikhs allowed to retain articles of faith, grandfathered in after a change in policy.
In April 2009, Sikh Army Captain Kamaljeet S. Kalsi, a doctor, with the help of the Sikh Coalition, filed an objection to the Inspector General and the Department of Defense to be allowed to continue to serve with their religious apparel intact. Army Reserve Second Lieutenant Tejdeep Singh Rattan, a dentist, joined in filing the petition. Kalsi joined the Army via its Health Professions Scholarship Program and had been reassured by the recruiter that wearing the uniform while retaining their religiously required appearance and apparel would not be a problem. Kalsi had even served in uniform without any problems at West Point and Travis Air Force Base. Yet, a problem arose in early 2009 when the Pentagon told Kalsi and Rattan that they would be called to active duty and would need to shave their beards and stop wearing their turbans.
The Sikh Coalition argued that not allowing the servicemembers to continue to maintain their appearance according to their religion violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. The Army argued that continued wear of the turban and beard violated current regulation, that would hinder the servicemembers from meeting health, safety, and mission requirements including the use of gas masks. In late October 2009, Kalsi was allowed an exemption to the policy, and would be able to serve while adhering to their religious beliefs. The Army continues to maintain that these were specific determinations due to the individual case and that present regulations will not change, however the Sikh Coalition holds out that this will be the beginning of a policy shift that will allow other Sikhs to serve their country in uniform.
The case of Rattan was put on hold, pending their completion of the dental boards exam. Upon graduation from basic officer training at Fort Sam Houston as a captain on March 22, 2010 Rattan was also granted an exemption. A third serviceman, Specialist Lamba, who graduated from Fort Jackson in November 2010 was also granted an exemption.
After a legal battle, Army Captain Simratpal Singh won long-term religious accommodation in 2016 that allowed them to maintain the articles of their Sikh faith while serving. Specialist Harpal Singh (US Army Reserves), Specialist Kanwar Singh (MA National Guard) and Private Arjan Ghotra (VA National Guard) were also allowed to attend Army's Basic Combat Training in summer 2016. Specialist Harpal Singh received Soldier of the Cycle award from their chain of command at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Not long after, in early 2017, the Army updated its regulations on grooming and appearances to allow Sikh soldiers and Muslim women to wear religious coverings, and for Sikh men to keep their beards.
In January 2017, following the outcome of a lawsuit under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, regulations were changed, allowing for the wearing of beards and turbans by religious individuals (the same ruling also allowed the wearing of burkas and hijabs by Muslims). The ruling does stipulate that the regulations can require that the beards must be worn at certain lengths (via rolling and clipping) and must not interfere with operations. Second Lieutenant Kanwar Singh became the first Sikh service-member to complete US Army's Officer Candidate School under the new military policy. They completed Basic Combat Training (Fort Jackson - 2016), Officer Candidate School (Massachusetts, Connecticut and Alabama - 2018) and Signal Basic Officer Leaders Course (Fort Gordon - 2020) with unshorn hair, beard, and turban. They currently serve as a commissioned officer in the Massachusetts National Guard (US Army Signal Corps).
In June 2019, Airman Harpreetinder Singh Bajwa became the first active duty airman allowed to serve with a beard, turban and unshorn hair as part of given religious accommodation. Bajwa is a first-generation American who enlisted in the Air Force in 2017. Bajwa learned of exemptions granted to Sikh members in the Army, and that in 2018, the Air Force had allowed a Muslim JAG Corps officer, Captain Maysaa Ouza, liberty to wear a hijab. After hearing about Captain Ouza, they contacted Kamal Kalsi, a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army Reserve and founder of the Sikh American Veterans Alliance who helped them make their case.
In June 2020, Anmol Narang became the first observant Sikh to graduate from the United States Military Academy.

Arkansas Nuclear One (ANO) is a two-unit pressurized water nuclear power plant located on Lake Dardanelle outside Russellville, Arkansas. Owned by Entergy Arkansas and operated by Entergy Nuclear, it is the only nuclear power facility in Arkansas.
Units
Unit One
Unit One has a generating capacity of 846 megawatts and came online on May 21, 1974. It is licensed to operate through May 20, 2034. Its nuclear reactor was supplied by Babcock & Wilcox.
Unit Two
Unit Two has a generating capacity of 930 megawatts and came online on September 1, 1978. It is licensed to operate through July 18, 2038. Its nuclear reactor was supplied by Combustion Engineering. Unit Two is the only one that uses a cooling tower; Unit One releases heat into Lake Dardanelle.
Surrounding population
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.
The 2010 U.S. population within of Arkansas Nuclear was 44,139, an increase of 17.2 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 308,219, an increase of 13.3 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Russellville (6 miles to city center).
Seismic risk
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Arkansas Nuclear was 1 in 243,902, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.
March 2013 incident
On March 31, 2013, an industrial accident at the facility killed one person and injured eight other workers, including four seriously. The accident took place "in a non-radiation area, and there was no risk to public health and safety." According to Entergy, the old stator of Unit One's generator fell during an operation to replace it. The falling component ruptured a water pipe, causing water infiltration into the plant's switchgear, which knocked out power to all of Unit One and one train of Unit Two's electrical system, which was online at the time. The electrical failure caused an automatic shutdown of Unit Two. The plant's emergency generators started and restored power to the emergency systems of both units. Unit One was in a refueling outage. Emergency diesel generators, water pumps and feed water were functioning following a loss of all off-site power on Unit One, according to the NRC event notification. The plant was placed under an "unusual event classification", which is the lowest of four emergency classification levels for abnormal events designated by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which regulates American civil nuclear installations. One plant worker died, and ten other injuries required offsite medical treatment. The company released an official statement of condolence. Entergy announced that they would immediately commence repairs to Unit Two and hope to have the unit back online within several weeks. Entergy also acknowledged that Unit One would be offline for an extended time while the company surveyed the damage and established a timeline for repairs.
The cost of the repairs was estimated at $95–120M, not counting additional costs to replace lost electricity from the reactors being down for four months. Both units were repaired, and started up on August 7, 2013 capable of returning to full power. During the recovery from the incident a specialist engineering company named Lowther-Rolton assisted with the recovery of the existing Stator and performed a "Technical Audit" (also called a "third-party review") of the engineering for lifting and installation of the new Stator to ensure safety of operations.
December 2013 incident
On December 9, 2013, Unit Two was taken offline due to a transformer fire in the site switchyard. The fire was contained without injuries or threats to safety.

The latest () population estimate for the City of Sheffield is residents. This represents an increase of about 17,000 people since the last census in 2011.
In the 21st century the city has undergone a population growth above that of the national average, and is projected to increase to over 600,000 by 2020. This can largely be attributed to immigration and relatively high birth rates.
Population
People from Sheffield (or 'Sheffielders') are colloquially known to residents of the surrounding towns of Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Chesterfield as "dee-dars", which derives from the traditional pronunciation of the "th" in the dialectal words "thee" and "thou", still used, especially by older people, in South Yorkshire. Many Yorkshire dialect words and aspects of pronunciation derive from old Norse due to the Viking influence in this region.
As with many British cities, the major period of growth in Sheffield's population occurred during the industrial revolution, when the city attracted large numbers of people looking for work in the local industries (particularly the cutlery and steel industries). In 1801 the population of the Parish of Sheffield was 45,755, by 1891 the population of the soon-to-be City of Sheffield (which covered the same area) was 325,547. Through most of the 20th century, despite the decline in manufacturing jobs from the 1970s onwards, the population remained relatively stable at about 515,000. This was due in part to the efforts made by the city to bring in white collar jobs.

Somalis and Ethiopians
The Sheffield Somali community is the second largest and one of the oldest in the United Kingdom, with the first Somalis having arrived in Britain during the interwar period and more arriving, particularly to work in the city's steel industry, between the 1940s and 1960s. Most of the current population however have settled in Sheffield since the 1980s due to unrest and drought in their homeland. According to the Department for Communities and Local Government, estimates of the Somali community made between 2003 and 2007 ranged from 3,000 to 5,000. Based on data from the Information Centre about Asylum and Refugees, the International Organization for Migration gave an estimate of 10,000 in 2006.

The number of Black Africans living in Sheffield in 2006 was 8,300.

A Polish Consulate was opened in Sheffield in 1997 in honour of this. The Sheffield East European community has grown substantially since 2004 when several East European countries joined the E.U with the main settlers being from Poland, Latvia and Slovakia. In July 2006 the Home Office gave Sheffield City Council extra funds to look after and house its large new immigrant East European communities.

The Sheffield Chinese Community Centre is also based here.
