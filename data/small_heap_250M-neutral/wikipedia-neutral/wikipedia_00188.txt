Maio is the easternmost of the Sotavento islands of Cape Verde. Maio is located south of the island of Boa Vista and east of Santiago. Administratively, the island forms one concelho (municipality): Maio.
History
The island was discovered in 1460. It was first settled at the end of the 16th century, when the land was used to raise livestock, especially goats. Salt was first exploited in the 17th century which caused the population to grow. The English exported salt to Europe from Porto Inglês, hence the name of that city.
The inconclusive Battle of Maio was fought between British and French frigate squadrons off the island's southern coast on 23 January 1814 in the last stages of the Napoleonic Wars. Due to persisting drought many inhabitants emigrated from Maio in the 20th century.
Geography
The island has an area of 274.5 km2. It is 24.1 km long and 16.3 km wide. The tallest mountain on the island (436 m) is near the east coast, in a mountain range named Monte Penoso. Terras Salgadas is a salty plain in the far north. The northernmost point on the island is Ponta Cais. 20% of the island area (54.5 km2) is forested and 28% of the island area (76.0 km2) is a protected area. Bay includes Baía do Galeão and Baía da Santana to the north and in the southeast is a lagoon named Lagoa Cimidor. The uninhabited islet Ilhéu Laje Branca lies near its north coast. The island's main town is Porto Inglês, near which its airport, Maio Airport lies.
Municipality
Administratively, the island of Maio is covered by one municipality, Concelho do Maio. This municipality consists of one freguesia (civil parish), Nossa Senhora da Luz, which also covers the whole island. The freguesia is subdivided into the following settlements:
Alcatraz
Barreiro (town)
Calheta (town)
Cascabulho
Figueira
Morro
Morrinho
Pedro Vaz
Pilão Cão
Porto Inglês (city)
Praia Gonçalo
Ribeira Dom João
Santo António
Politics
Since 2004, the Movement for Democracy (MpD) is the ruling party of the municipality. The results of the latest elections, in 2016:
Population
In the 1830s, the population was estimated at 2,500. Most people in Maio are Roman Catholic.
Economy
The island prospered around salt collecting in its early days of colonialism, with a little agriculture and grazing.
There are two types of agriculture practiced in Maio, rain fed and irrigated. During the raining season products as corn, beans, pumpkins and melons are being cultivated. Products that farmers cultivate year round are sweet potato, cassava, papaya, fig, coconut and tamarind. Goats, cows, pigs, chickens and donkeys are common on the island. Few people own a horse. Scarcity of water is the biggest problem for the locals.
Fishery is important and abundant available. Tuna, sailfish and different coral fishes such as the coral hind are caught.
The economy is heavily supported by migrants who send money to their family on the island.
Sports
Football is by far the most popular sport, but basketball and futsal along with water sports as surfing, diving and swimming are becoming more popular.

El Corso was launched in Spain in 1791 as a naval brig. the British Royal Navy captured them in 1796 and took them into service as HMS Corso. They then served in the Mediterranean where they captured numerous small vessels, the great majority of which were merchant vessels. In 1802 they sailed to England. From July 1802 to their sale in September 1814 they served as a receiving ship.
Capture
On 2 December 1796 encountered the Spanish naval brig El Corso off Monaco as El Corso was on their way from Genoa to Barcelona. Southampton captured El Corso by boarding. They were armed with eighteen 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 136 men under the command of Don Antonio Oacaro. The Royal Navy took the brig into service as HMS Corso.
Royal Navy
Commander Bartholomew James commissioned Corso in the Mediterranean in December 1796.
On 6 August 1798 Corso and captured Liguria.
On 24 August Corso captured the French privateer Francois near Corfu. Francois was armed with two guns on carriages and six swivel guns. They had a crew of 23 men under the command of Clement Roux. They were five days out of Malaga and had captured nothing.
On 18 October Corso and Espoir captured Madona del Ydra.
Commander Lord William Stuart was appointed to command Corso on 24 December 1798, but Lieutenant Corydon Boger, from was in temporary command on 20 November 1798 in Stuart's place. Corso was in Tangier Bay, having the day before brought a convoy into the Bay of Gibraltar. Boger encountered and chased two French privateers. They captured one of them, Adolphe, of six guns on carriages, and with a crew of 42 men. The other privateer ran on shore about two miles west of Tariff. Because dusk was approaching and the weather was hazy, Boger could not safely attempt to destroy them
Then on 1 December Lieutenant Boger chased a French privateer on shore three leagues eastward of Cape Malabar. With the assistance of boats from Espoir the British were able to bring them off. When the boarding party arrived at the vessel they found that their crew had deserted them The privateer, of unknown name, was armed with two carriage guns, two swivels, and small arms. Corso and Espoir shared the prize money for the vessel, which the London Gazette, apparently mistakenly, described as the barque Adolphe.
By January 1799 Commander Stuart was in command of Corso. In February–March 1799 Corso was in the Ionian Islands. They had been sent there to encourage the joint Russian-Ottoman squadron under Admiral Ushakov conducting the Siege of Corfu (1798–1799) to send some vessels to join the British at Messina. Corso may have participated in the seizure of the island of Vido.
Stuart received promotion to post captain and took command of at Plymouth on 9 November 1799. In November Commander William Ricketts assumed command of Corso.
A French convoy carrying troops and supplies to Malta left Toulon around 7 February 1800. The convoy consisted of the 74-gun , the 20-gun corvettes and , the 16-gun , and two or three transport ships.
On 18 February 1800 Corso was in company with a number of ships under the command of Lord Nelson when lookouts on sighted the French and gave chase. Alexander caught up with one of the French ships, which struck after Alexander fired a few shots. Nelson ordered and Corso to take charge of the captured French ship while they in their flagship , with Alexander, , and the frigate continued the chase. The British eventually caught up with Contre-amiral Jean-Baptiste Perrée's flagship Généreux and forced them to surrender.
On the 19th Corso arrived at the British blockade of Malta with the vessel that Alexander had captured. The captured vessel was Ville de Marseilles, transport armed en flûte, was carrying salt meat, brandy, wine, clothing, stores, etc.
In March 1800 Corso captured three merchantmen:
Swedish brig Catherine, from Barcelona to Leghorn, with a cargo of wine, brandy, and cochineal (14 March);
Genoese gondolo Signora della Latera, from Cabic to Genoa, with a cargo of wheat (16 March);
Ragusan brig Assunta, from Marseilles bound to Leghorn and Ragusa, with a cargo of wine and copper (20 March).
While Napoleon Bonaparte and their army were in Egypt, Bonaparte sent an emissary with gifts to the Bashaw of Tripoli, who consequently expelled the British consul general there. Nelson had Corso convey the consul general back to Tripoli with Ricketts negotiating the consul's reinstatement. Over subsequent months Corso sailed to and from Tripoli several times.
Corso also assisted at the siege of Genoa (6 April – 4 June 1800). Them dispersal of a grain convoy helped the Austrian forces to capture the city, albeit only temporarily.
In June and July Corso captured more merchant vessels:
French tartane, name unknown, carrying flour (25 June);
Ragusan brig Pastor Fidele, from Barcelona to Leghorn, carrying brandy (11 July);
Ragusan brig San Gaetano, from Barcelona to Leghorn, carrying wine(13 July);
Genoese settee, name unknown, from Port Maurice, with no cargo (destroyed 24 July);
Genoese polacre ship Saint Gio Baptiste, from Marseilles to Port Maurice, carrying wine (25 July);
Genoese settee Misericordia, from Marseilles to Savona, carrying hoops (25 July); *Genoese settee Nostra Signora Montresero, from Port Maurice to Marseilles (25 July).
On 28 August 1800, Corso and Pigmy were at Cesenatico. Their orders were to destroy the vessels in its harbour, and "make a proper example of the town." The British were unable to approach closely enough so during the night of 30 August Ricketts sent in boats of both vessels under the overall command of Lieutenant James Lucas Yeo, first lieutenant of Corso. The attackers were able to capture the town, sink two boats, and burn 11 others. One of the sunken vessels was deeply laden with copper, money, and bale goods. Four of the vessels sank in the mouth of the harbour, and fire consumed both piers. The British sailors were able to hold off some French infantry, but when Ricketts observed French cavalry approaching they ordered the boats to withdraw.
Afterwards, Ricketts sent the authorities of the town the following note:
To the Inhabitants of Cesenatico.
The Treachery of your Municipality, in causing to be arrested an Officer with Dispatches, has been long known to the British Admiral in these Seas. That Municipality may now sadly know that the Severity of Judgment, long delayed, is always exemplary. That the Innocent suffer with the Guilty, though much to be regretted, is the natural Feature of War; and the more terrible Infliction on this occasion, the more striking the Example should prove to surrounding Municipalities.
(Signed) W. RICKETTS

On 6 September 1800 Corso captured:

Meanwhile, the cutting out party brought out Tigre, together with bales of cotton and other goods that they had taken from vessels they had robbed.
An attempt to attack Pesaro with the aid of Italian partisans came to nothing. Corso and Pigmy then answered an appeal from Venice and took all necessary measures to protect the city against a reported French force.
Harbour service
On 10 July 1802 Corso arrived at Spithead from the Mediterranean. On the 15th they sailed from Spithead or Woolwich to be paid off. Between 20 July and 24 March 1803 Corso underwent fitting at Deptford for service as a receiving ship. Lieutenant Joshua Kneeshaw recommissioned them at Woolwich.
On 27 March 1803 Corso was ordered to Gravesend to serve under Captain Motley, the Regulating Officer there. Them role was to receive men pressed from merchant vessels, such as East Indiamen, returning to England.

Saint Philip of Agira (also Argirò, Aggira, Agirone, Agirya or Argira) was an early Christian confessor. There are two parallel stories of this saint which give to possible dates in which this saint lived. Traditionally, through the writings of St. Athanasius, it is maintained that Philip of Agira is a saint of the 1st century, born in the year AD 40 in Cappadocia (modern Turkey) and died on 12 May, AD 103.
Another recent study says to have been born of a Syrian father in Thrace on an unknown date in the 5th century whose elder brothers drowned whilst fishing. Philip was known as the "Apostle of the Sicilians", as they were the first Christian missionary to visit that island. Nothing else can be certainly stated about him.
Their feast day is 12 May, and they are naturally, patron saint of the city of Agira, Sicily, and of the city of Ħaż-Żebbuġ, Malta, they are celebrated also in the town of Limina, Sicily, where they also lived. Putatively, their relics were discovered in the church dedicated to them in Agira. Philip is one of the patron saints of the United States Army Special Forces and also known for their power of accomplish exorcisms.

Terry William Rozier III (born March 17, 1994) is an American professional basketball player for the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). They played college basketball for the Louisville Cardinals before being selected with the 16th overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics. Rozier spent their first 4 seasons as a reserve with the Celtics until being traded to the Hornets in a sign-and-trade deal.
Early life
Rozier was born in Youngstown, Ohio, in 1994. Their father, Terry Rozier Sr., was sent to prison for eight years two months after their birth. Then, in 2005, Rozier Jr. spent a few months with their father, who had just been released from prison, before they were arrested again on charges of involuntary manslaughter for their involvement in a robbery and kidnapping from 2003 that had led to the accidental death of an accomplice. Rozier Sr. was then sentenced to thirteen years in prison. As a consequence, Rozier was raised primarily by their mother, Gina Tucker, and their grandmother, Amanda Tucker, alongside their brother and half sister.
High school career
Rozier starred at Shaker Heights High School in Shaker Heights, Ohio, graduating in 2012. In their senior year, they averaged 25.6 points, 6.5 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 4.7 steals per game while leading Shaker to a 21–3 record and taking them to the regional semifinals as a senior for the first time since 2002. They were named an All-Lake Erie League selection for three years and was 74th in recruiting ranking on ESPNU's Top 100 Players list in 2012.
As they needed to improve their grades, Rozier initially played at Hargrave Military Academy before joining Louisville. In their 2012–13 campaign at Hargrave, Rozier averaged 29.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 5.6 assists while the team went 38–8; they also earned the 2012 Kentucky Derby Festival Basketball Classic MVP and placed second in the dunk and three-point contest that season.
College career
As a first-year student at Louisville in 2013–14, Rozier averaged 7.0 points and 3.1 rebounds per game in 37 games, and made the ACC All-Rookie Team. As a sophomore in 2014–15, Rozier led the Cardinals in scoring with 17.1 points per game, and was named second-team All-ACC. On March 30, 2015, Rozier and Louisville teammate Montrezl Harrell declared for the 2015 NBA draft.

On January 31, Rozier logged their first career triple-double in their first NBA start to help the Celtics to a 103–73 victory over the New York Knicks. They recorded 17 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists to become just the second player in NBA history with a triple-double in their first start, joining Tony Wroten, who set the initial record on November 13, 2013, with the Philadelphia 76ers. Two days later, in their second career start, Rozier scored a career-high 31 points in a 119–110 win over the Hawks.

The Scares or the Scare Rocks are rocky islets in Luce Bay off the coast of Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. By far the largest is Big Scare. There is a small outlying rock to its west and three companion islets called the Little Scares are about 1 km to the north east. Big Scare is south west of Port William and a similar distance east of the Mull of Galloway.
The schooner Annie Mclester was wrecked on Big Scare at an unknown date in the 19th century. On 27 January 1849 the 400 ton barque Archibald of Memel, was wrecked on the Little Scares. In September 1860 a small round-sterned four-oared boat was picked up near to Big Scare. The parent vessel had presumably been lost in the vicinity although no record of this is known.
There is an MOD firing range in the area with brightly coloured floating targets deployed. The southern limit is marked by buoys SSE of The Scares.
The islands are part of Luce Bay and Sands SAC and are leased to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. They have been described as an "inaccessible bird reserve" and provide nesting sites for more than 2,000 pairs of breeding northern gannets, hundreds of guillemots and smaller numbers of shags and kittiwakes.

Bang Tanai (, ) is one of twelve tambons (sub-districts) of Pak Kret District, Nonthaburi Province in central Thailand.
History
Since the late Ayutthaya period, Bang Tanai was settled by a large number of Mon inhabitants. They inhabit areas along the Chao Phraya River, such as Bang Khu Wat in Pathum Thani Province.
After the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767, the area was abandoned. King Taksin later allowed the Mon people resettle their former villages. In 1822, a large number of Mon immigrants from Burma settled in Siam. King Nangklao (Rama III) allow them to populate Bang Tanai, Bang Phut, and Khlong Ban Laem Yai. They have lived there continuously since then.
The name "Bang Tanai" means "place of toothbrush trees" (Streblus asper), as this plant once flourished along waterways from here to Pathum Thani. Mons call this species of plant khanai (คะไน), which the Thais mispronounced as tanai. Bang is defined by the Royal Institute Dictionary as 'hamlet or community by the waterfront'.
Geography
Bang Tanai has an area of approximately 2,575 rai (4.12 km2), most of the area consisting of lowlands along the Chao Praya River. It is about 20 km (12.43 mi) from Pak Kret.
Neighboring tambons are (from the north clockwise): Khlong Khoi and Bang Khu Wat of Pathum Thani Province; Bang Phut and Pak Kret, Ko Kret, and Khlong Phra Udom of Nonthaburi.
Economy
Most Bang Tanai residents work in agriculture.
Administration
Bang Tanai is administered by the Subdistrict Administrative Organization (SAO) Bang Tanai (องค์การบริหารส่วนตำบลบางตะไนย์).

The BC Bike Race is a seven-day mountain bike stage race held in British Columbia, Canada, traditionally held in early July. Six hundred racers ride an average of 50 kilometres a day on race routes that are 75% singletrack.
Route
Each year, the BC Bike Race route changes, but has always included Vancouver Island, the Sunshine Coast, and the Sea to Sky Corridor. The 2010 version of the race involved a Prologue on Vancouver's North Shore, then days in Nanaimo, Cumberland, Powell River, Earls Cove to Sechelt, Sechelt to Langdale, Squamish, and Whistler. The race format evolved with years, in particular the Vancouver's North Shore stage was not included in 2013 race.
Between 2010 and 2012 the event offered the racers two formats: Epic and Challenge. The Epic (run since 2007) is seven days of racing with the average course length of 60 km each day. The Challenge (run since 2010 until 2012) is also seven days, but sports an average of 30 km each day. Both options took place at the same time and incorporate the same Base Camps each day.
The route for 2019 will once again include a prologue in North Vancouver. Racers then will experience Cowichan Valley, Cumberland (for two stages), Powell River, Sechelt (for two stages), and the final stage in Squamish.
Categories
In 2007 and 2008, racers had to compete as part of a team. Now, BC Bike Race offers a Solo option; Solo categories are Open Men, Men 40+, Men 50+ Open Women, Women 40+, and Women 50+. Teams of two categories include: Open Men, Open Women, Open Mixed, Veterans 80+ (combined age of both riders is over eighty), and Veterans 100+ (combined age over one hundred).
Guest racers
The race has been known to extend invitations to certain riders to compete as a celebrity guest on certain stages. Past guests include Trevor Linden (Ex-Captain of the Vancouver Canucks).

Tangled Up is the second studio album by American country music singer Thomas Rhett. It was released on September 25, 2015, via Valory Music Group. The album's lead single "Crash and Burn", was released to radio on April 27, 2015. The album's second single, "Die a Happy Man" was released to country radio on September 28, 2015, but was available for download as a pre-order for the album on September 18, 2015.
Reception
Critical
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic thought that the Thomas Rhett's second album feels like an album "where the singer/songwriter comes into their own" and rated the album 4 stars out of 5. They thought that Rhett "displays an omnivorous cultural appetite" in the album where Rhett might be "dropping passing allusions to Guns N' Roses and Third Eye Blind" to using disco beat. They judged Rhett to be "a true pop artist, harnessing the trends of their time and turning them into music that's hard to resist." Billboard also picked up on the disco influence, noting that songs in the album, such as "Tangled", "sound as Saturday Night Fever'd as anything recorded by a male country star in decades", but wondered whether "country radio will fully embrace their Nashville disco or ignore it."
Commercial
Tangled Up debuted on the Billboard 200 at No. 6 and Top Country Albums at No. 3, with 76,000 units sold, 63,000 of which are pure album sales. It reached No. 2 on the Top Country Albums chart in its fourth week. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA on September 20, 2016. The album has sold over 598,900 copies in the US as of September 2017.

The Oak Ridge Boys also recorded it under the original title, as the b-side to their 1983 single "Love Song".
A 1985 recording by Eddy Raven, under the title "Operator, Operator", appeared on their album Love and Other Hard Times. This version went to number 9 on the same chart. Two versions of Raven's version were issued: One has a standard fade during the reprisal of the refrain, the other has a slightly different transition into the final refrain, with Raven – after being cut off – screaming into the phone that they have no more change to continue the call, with that track being played over Raven singing.

In Greek mythology, Carius or Karios (Ancient Greek: Κάριος) was the son of Zeus and Torrhebia. Their mother's name is connected to Torrhebos, name of a city in Lydia. According to Hellanicus, there was a mountain named Karios (Carius) near this city, with the sanctuary of Carius situated on it. Nicolaus Damascenus related of them the following tale.
Mythology
As Carius was wandering by a lake which later received the name Torrhebis, they heard the voices of nymphs singing; these nymphs, Nicolaus remarked, were also called the Muses by the Lydians. Carius learned the music from them, and taught it to the Lydians. This kind of music was known as "Torrhebian songs".
Carius ("of Caria") was also a surname of Zeus himself, under which they were venerated in Mylasa.

Takalar Regency (, ) is a regency of South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. It covers an area of 566.51 km2 and had a population of 269,603 at the 2010 census and 300,853 at the 2020 census; the official estimate for mid 2021 was 302,695. The entire regency lies within the official metropolitan area of the city of Makassar (the metropolitan area is known as Mamminasata). The principal towns are at Galesong and Takalar, but the administrative centre is at Pattallassang.
Administrative division
At the 2010 census the regency was divided into nine districts (), but a tenth district (Kepulauan Tanakeke) was subsequently cut out of Mappakusunggu District. The districts are tabulated below with their areras and their population totals from the 2010 census and the 2020 census, together with the official estimates for mid 2021. The table also includes the number of administrative villages (rural desa and urban kelurahan) in each district, and its postal codes.
Notes: (a) comprises a group of eight offshore islands. (b) the 2010 figures are included in the figures for Mappakusunggu District. (c) includes offshore island of Pulau Sanrobengi.
The regency is virtually split into two parts, with part of Gowa Regency nearly reaching the coast between Galesong Selatan and Sanrobone districts. The northern part (the three Galesong districts) forms an urbanised narrow coastal strip stretching south from Makassar city, plus the small offshore island of Pulau Sanrobengi; it covers 65.75 km2 with over 110,000 inhabitants in 2021. The larger southern area comprise the remaining seven districts.

This List of impact craters in Antarctica includes only unconfirmed and theoretical impact sites in Antarctica and the surrounding waters of the Southern Ocean. There are not yet any confirmed impact sites in Antarctica according to the Earth Impact Database.
Unconfirmed impact craters
The following craters are officially considered "unconfirmed" because they are not listed in the Earth Impact Database. Due to stringent requirements regarding evidence and peer-reviewed publication, newly discovered craters or those with difficulty collecting evidence generally are known for some time before becoming listed. However, entries on the unconfirmed list could still have an impact origin disproven.

Mbuna (pronounced Mmm-boo - nah ) is the common name for a large group of African cichlids from Lake Malawi, and are members of the haplochromine family. The name mbuna means "rockfish" in the language of the Tonga people of Malawi. As the name implies, most mbuna are cichlids that live among the piles of rocks and along the rocky shores of Lake Malawi, as opposed to the utaka, cichlids that live in the open water or on sandy shores or soft substrates. Some species of mbuna are highly sexually dimorphic, although many are not. Among biologists, almost all of the cichlid species of Lake Malawi, including mbuna and non mbuna such as the utaka, are believed to have descended from one or a very few species that became isolated in the lake. With rising water levels, new habitats could be colonized and the many isolated rocky outcrops allowed new mbuna species to form. Their striking colors, intriguing behavioral characteristics, and relative hardiness make them very popular despite their unique demands for the home aquarist.
Mbuna in aquaria
These cichlids are some of the most colorful freshwater fish for the home aquarium. Mbuna are very aggressive and territorial fish, they are not suitable for beginner fishkeepers. A suitable aquarium setting includes many rocks, adequate filtration, caves, and hiding places; plants may be uprooted, so they are best avoided, but a small number will work well in the aquarium. One of these is Java fern, which may become the object of mbuna aggression, but will not be eaten due to an undesirable taste.
Social behavior
Mbuna exhibit strong social behavior and establish a clearly visible social hierarchy including well-defined and enforced territories. A dominant male maintains a spherical territory, only allowing females to enter this territory for breeding purposes. Overcrowding helps spread out the aggression caused by these territorial conflicts. They, like Astatotilapia burtoni, are maternal mouthbrooders and breed readily in good conditions.
Water parameters
All species from Lake Malawi thrive in the temperature range of 77-84 °F. pH 7.5-8.4 is ideal with an almost pristine (near 0 ppm) ammonia and ammonium nitrite content.
Notable mbuna cichlids
Many mbuna cichlids are regularly stocked and sold by pet shops. Some of the most common ones are the Bumblebee Cichlid or Hornet Cichlid (Pseudotropheus crabro), Golden Cichlid (Melanochromis auratus), Electric Yellow or Yellow Lab Cichlid (Labidochromis caeruleus), Red Zebra Cichlid (Maylandia estherae), Blue Zebra Cichlid (Maylandia callainos), and Blue Johannii Melanochromis cyaneorhabdos. Many of these species are considered to have large territorial needs and aggressively defend these territories. Cichlids belonging to any of the genera listed below are considered mbuna.

The sooty-headed wren (Pheugopedius spadix) is a species of bird in the family Troglodytidae. It is found in Colombia and Panama.
Taxonomy and systematics
The sooty-headed wren was previously treated as conspecific with the black-throated wren (Pheugopedius atrogularis) but significant differences in their plumage, song, and ranges demanded their separation.
According to the International Ornithological Committee (IOC) the sooty-headed wren is monotypic. However, the Clements taxonomy, BirdLife International (BLI), and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Birds of the World recognize two subspecies, the nominate Pheugopedius spadix spadix and P. s. xerampelinus.
Description
The sooty-headed wren is long. The nominate adults' crown, shoulders, and back are dull blackish and the rump bright chestnut. Their tail is chestnut with bold black bars. Much of their face is black with white streaks. Their chin and throat are black and contrast with the bright chestnut lower throat and chest. The belly is a duller grayish brown between reddish brown flanks. The juvenile is duller than the adult and has less contrast between the areas of different color. P. s. xerampelinus is overall paler than the nominate and has less extensive reddish brown on the flanks.
Distribution and habitat
The nominate sooty-headed wren is found in Colombia, in the Pacific lowlands from southern Chocó Department to Nariño Department and east from there into the central Magdalena Valley and some isolated mountain ranges. P. s. xerampelinus is found on the Pacific slope of far southern Panama's Darién Province. The species inhabits the interior and edges of humid forest, cloudforest, and dense secondary forest. It favors areas with heavy moss growth. In elevation it mostly ranges between but can be found as low as in Colombia.
Behavior
Feeding
The sooty-headed wren usually forages in pairs, staying low in the vegetation, and seldom joins mixed-species foraging flocks. It has been observed following army ant swarms. Its prey is mostly or entirely invertebrates including spiders and adult and larval insects.
Breeding
Though little information has been published about the sooty-headed wren's breeding phenology, it appears to have a breeding season spanning from March to December. Its nest is a ball made of coarse material and leaves with a side entrance.
Vocalization
Both sexes of the sooty-headed wren sing, "a series of...gurgling whistles" .
Status
The IUCN has assessed the sooty-headed wren as being of The Least Concern. It is "[f]airly common in suitable habitat in Colombia."

Juan Bautista 'Gianni' Vicini Cabral (Genoa, 7 April 1924–Santo Domingo, 27 April 2015) was an Italian Dominican business person, chairperson of Grupo Vicini.
Biography
Vicini was born on 7 April 1924 in Genoa, Italy, during a vacation of their family, to the Italian-Dominican business person Felipe Augusto Vicini Perdomo (half-brother of President Juan Bautista Vicini Burgos) and Dominican heiress Amelia María Cabral Bermúdez (daughter of José María Cabral y Báez and sister of José María Cabral Bermúdez). Their siblings were: Laura Amelia (1925–2006), who married Amadeo Barletta Ricart, the son of Amadeo Barletta Barletta; José María (1926–2007), who married María Elena Pérez Branger; and Felipe de Jesús Vicini Cabral (1936–1997). They were first cousin of Donald Reid Cabral, President de facto of the Dominican Republic, first cousin-once removed of José María Cabral, film director, and second cousin of Peggy Cabral, vice mayor of Santo Domingo.
They married Alma Stella Altagracia Lluberes Henríquez (1936–1992), the daughter of Mario Rafael Lluberes Abréu and Josefa Stella Henríquez Vásquez (a granddaughter of intellectual Federico Henríquez y Carvajal and diplomat Francisco Leonte Vásquez Lajara; the latter was brother of President Horacio Vásquez Lajara). They had 3 children: Felipe Augusto Antonio (b. 1960), Amelia Stella María (b. 1974), and Juan Bautista Vicini Lluberes (b. 1975).
In 1936 their father died and Vinici became the chairperson of Grupo Vicini, one of the largest sugar companies in the Dominican Republic. During their tenure, Grupo Vicini became the main private sugar producer and afterwards the most important corporation in the Dominican Republic, with investments in many key economic sectors.

Tarḫuntaradu (Luwian: "worshiper of Tarḫunt") was king of Arzawa during the first half of the 14th century BC. Under their rule, the Luwian kingdom of Arzawa managed to penetrate far into the territory of the Hittite Empire, then weakened by invasions of the Kaška peoples. Tarhantaradu occupied areas in the "Lower Land" (Lycaonia), and succeeded in penetrating as far as the Hittite city of Tuwanuwa. They negotiated with, and married a daughter of, the Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep III, who acknowledged them as "Great King" - a title usually given to the Hittite ruler.

A wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) is a non-invasive, external device for patients at risk of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). It allows physicians time to assess their patient's arrhythmic risk and make appropriate plans. It is a leased device.
Description
The WCD is non-invasive, external device that is leased, to be returned after use. It consists of two components; garment and monitor. The garment, worn underclothing, detects arrhythmias and delivers treatment shocks. The monitor is worn around the waist or from a shoulder strap and records the arrhythmias. The device continuously monitors the patient's heart and, if a life-threatening heart rhythm is detected, it can deliver a treatment shock to restore normal heart rhythm. The entire event, from detecting a life-threatening arrhythmia to automatically delivering a treatment shock, usually occurs in less than a minute. The WCD does not require bystander intervention and has a 98 percent first treatment shock success rate for resuscitating patients from SCA.
The WCD may be prescribed for patients at high risk of SCA following a heart attack, before or after bypass surgery or stent placement, as well as for those with cardiomyopathy or congestive heart failure that places them at particular risk.
The WCD is listed along with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), in the ACC/AHA/ESC Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Ventricular Arrhythmias and the Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death. It is also a Class I recommendation in the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Guidelines for the Care of Cardiac Transplant Candidates.
History
In 1986, M. Stephen Heilman and Larry Bowling founded Lifecor and along with a team of former Intec employees who developed the first implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) began development of the WCD. The WCD was extensively tested for three years in 17 major medical centers across the United States and Europe. The clinical data collected from those trials allowed Lifecor to obtain FDA approval for use of the WCD in the United States.
In 2001, the FDA approved the LifeVest wearable cardioverter defibrillator (model 2000). The Lifecor business was acquired by ZOLL Medical Corporation in 2006 and Asahi Kasei in 2012. As of 2015, the LifeVest was available in the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, Israel and Singapore.
According to ZOLL, the company that manufactures the LifeVest, the LifeVest has been prescribed to more than 100,000 patients.
Insurance coverage in the United States
The WCD is covered by most health plans in the United States, including commercial, state, and federal plans as Durable Medical Equipment (DME) for those patients at high risk of cardiac arrest, including:
Primary prevention [Ejection fraction (EF) ≤35% and Myocardial Infarction (MI), Non Ischemic Cardiomyopathy (NICM), or other Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)] including:
After recent MI (Coverage during the 40-day ICD waiting period)
Before and immediately after CABG or PTCA (Coverage during the 90-day ICD waiting period)
Listed for cardiac transplant
Recently diagnosed NICM (Coverage during the three-to-nine month ICD waiting period)
New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV heart failure
Terminal disease with life expectancy of less than one year
ICD indications when patient condition delays or prohibits ICD implantation
ICD explantation
Assessment of usefulness
The wearable cardioverter defibrillator is an option for patients who are at risk for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and are not candidates for or who refuse an implantable defibrillator. Not all cardiologists agree that a wearable cardioverter defibrillator is medically beneficial or necessary, compared to standard medical treatment for patients at risk for SCA.
In January 2018, the FDA issued a Safety Alert related to a known malfunction in some units which could prevent the WCD from delivering a treatment shock. Zoll had previously issued (in September 2017) a recall of the WCD in an attempt to address the issue, instructing users to return the device for replacement if the device displayed a specific error message indicating the malfunction. Copies of the alert were included in all subsequent shipments of the device.
The results of a randomized controlled trial were presented at the American College of Cardiology's 67th Annual Scientific Session (in the spring of 2018). The study results apparently did not show sufficient evidence to show the WCD reduced sudden cardiac arrest in post-heart attack patients. In the group that wore the WCD, 1.6% died from sudden cardiac arrest, and in the group that didn't wear the WCD, 2.4% died, which is arguably not a statistically significant difference.

Filipinos in Taiwan consist mainly of immigrants and workers from the Philippines. Filipinos form the third largest national contingent of migrant workers and account for about one-fifth of foreign workers in Taiwan as of April 2019.
Overview
Around 800 years ago, the ancestors of the Tao people, considered a Taiwanese aboriginal group, arrived on Orchid Island from the Batanes archipelago.
The strong Taiwanese economy, particularly in the manufacturing industries, attracts cheap manual labor from the Philippines. Most Filipinos working in Taiwan work as factory workers, domestic workers, construction workers, fishermen and professionals and they would send a large part of their earnings to their families in the Philippines. Many Taiwanese men have also chosen Filipino women as brides through arranged marriages. An estimated 7,000 Filipino women now live there with their Taiwanese husbands.
Philippine holidays such as Independence day and José Rizal Day are also celebrated by the Filipino community in Taiwan.
Many Philippine-educated Chinese Filipinos or so called Chinoys (Traditional Chinese: 華菲人) from middle-class families have migrated to Taiwan since the early 1990s. Approximately 1000 or more now have Taiwan citizenship.
Based on a report by Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), as of end of April 2019, 154,000 OFWs are living and working in Taiwan.
There are many Filipino stores, cargo, remittances and restaurants throughout the island of Taiwan.
Churches
St. Christopher's Church 聖多福天主堂 St. Christopher's Church 聖多福天主堂
Social Issues
Filipino laborers in Taiwan are usually vulnerable to exploitation by their employers, a situation common to unskilled migrant workers all over the world. The Taiwanese government has been receptive to the cases involving mistreatment of Filipino workers in Taiwan.
Filipino migrant caretakers in Taiwan have to go through a broker system that collects most of their monthly earnings, demands long work hours without overtime pay, and offers no days off. Some caretakers have to work for 24 hours a day. Home caretakers typically receive monthly salaries much lower than the standard set by the government because they are not covered by Taiwan's Labor Standards Act.
On 9 May 2013, the Philippine Coast Guard opened fire in open seas between the two countries on a Taiwanese fishing boat, killing one fisherman. Following the incident, Taiwan imposed sanctions on the Philippines, including the freeze of Filipino hires since the Filipino authorities refused and ignored the request for an apology to the families of the victim.

George Boyd (1825–1886) was an early New Zealand studio potter.
Boyd trained as a potter in Ireland before immigrating to New Zealand. In 1851 they settled in Auckland. Nine years later they set up their own business, the Newton Pottery. Although mainly producing functional items, they also earned a reputation for ornamental wares. In 1885 they exhibited a range of their products at the New Zealand Industrial Exhibition in Wellington, New Zealand. The judges commended Boyd's 'most attractive show of pottery' saying their work proved there could be 'a real art-feeling in the manufacture of cheap and common goods'. Following the exhibition, they gave a selection of their 'artistic wares' to the Colonial Museum, a predecessor of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.
When they died in 1886, their will ordered the executors to close down the Newton Pottery, sell the machinery, and destroy the moulds. Examples of their work are now rare and highly sought after. Their wife Helen died in 1898.

The see of the Diocese is currently vacant, after the former bishop Gary Nelson (who had served since 26 May 2012) retired on 15 May 2022. In September 2022, the Reverend Darrell Parker, currently Vicar of St Paul's Tamworth, was elected as the next bishop. They will be consecrated in St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney on 3 February 2023 and installed as bishop in the diocesan cathedral on 15 February 2023.
Structure and churchmanship
The diocese has 18 parishes and three Mission to Seafarers' ministries and the cathedral church of the diocese is the Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Geraldton.
The diocese is noted for its low church conservative Evangelical stance; no women serve as priests.
History
The diocese covering 2 million km² of Western Australia, north of Perth, is geographically the largest Anglican diocese in Australia and the largest land-based diocese in the world. The population of the area of about 150,000 people.
The Diocese of Perth was established in 1857, but the Diocese of Northern Australia (which became known by the present name in 1961) was not brought into existence until 1910. Broome was the original the seat of the Diocese, from 1910 to 1965, with the Church of the Annunciation the pro-cathedral.
Cathedral
The cathedral church of the diocese is the Cathedral of the Holy Cross, located in Cathedral Avenue, Geraldton.
The cathedral building was built in 1964 to a design by architects McDonald and Whitaker. The brick modernist style building has a star shaped footprint and is said to resemble Coventry Cathedral in England. Internally the cathedral has extensive stained glass and an organ built by Allen Organ Company.
Deans of the Cathedral have included:
1969–1974: Brian Kyme (later assistant bishop in Perth)
2003–2013: Jeremy Rice
2015–2020: Peter Grice (Bishop of Rockhampton from 2021)
2022-present: Lachlan Edwards (previously Rector of Christ Church, Lavender Bay)
List of bishops
Assistant bishops
Bernard Buckland was Regional Bishop for The Kimberleys (assistant bishop) until their retirement on 14 March 1997.
Structure
Due to the fluid nature of our region, we're proud to be a ‘missionary' diocese. We journey with everyone who comes and goes as part of work or tourism, and see a congregation turnover rate of around 100% every two years. Our region is dependent on support by individuals, parishes, dioceses, and Christian organisations across Australia who are committed to gospel ministry in small, remote, and isolated towns and communities in North West Australia.
Anglican realignment
The Diocese of North West Australia was the second in the Anglican Church of Australia, after the Anglican Diocese of Sydney, to recognize the Anglican Church in North America as a "member church of the Anglican Communion, in full communion with Diocese of North West Australia", according to a motion passed in October 2014.

HJ (Iran) and HT (Cameroon) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] UKSC 31 is a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom concerning two men, from Iran and Cameroon respectively, claiming asylum in the United Kingdom on the grounds of their homosexuality. The men's claims had previously been turned down on the basis they would not face persecution in their own countries if they would conceal their sexuality. The appeal therefore centred on the question as to whether the men on their return could reasonably be expected to tolerate this requirement of discretion; the so-called 'discretion' or 'reasonable tolerability' test. Interventions were made by the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
The case was heard between 10 and 12 May 2010 with a judgement delivered on 7 July 2010, in which the Court ruled unanimously that the men could not be expected to conceal their sexuality in this way, and that it was wrong to apply the so-called 'discretion test' to such claims. The cases were then both remitted to be reconsidered according to the advice contained in the judgement.
Facts
HJ is a gay Iranian man who arrived in the United Kingdom on 17 December 2001 and claimed asylum. HT is a gay man from Cameroon who had been on their way to Montreal when they were arrested at Gatwick Airport, London, on 19 January 2007 for using a false passport, at which time they claimed asylum.
The United Kingdom is a party to the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, which defines a refugee as "a person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion... is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to [his country of nationality]." Homosexuality is generally accepted, and was accepted in this case, as forming membership of a particular social group.
At the time asylum in the United Kingdom was controlled by the UK Border Agency as part of the Home Office, which refused asylum in both cases. Both men appealed their individual decisions without success, arriving in a conjoined appeal to the Court of Appeal (Pill and Keene LJJ and Sir Paul Kennedy), turned down on 10 March 2009. The Court of Appeal found that the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal had been entitled to find that HJ could reasonably be expected to tolerate the need for discretion on their return to Iran, and therefore was not entitled to asylum. The Court found that HT would be discreet on their return to Cameroon, and that they had not therefore established that there was a real risk of persecution. The Court decided that, on the basis of the 'discretion test', a State party to the Refugee Convention would be entitled to return a homosexual asylum-seeker to their country of origin if they would conceal their identity and sexuality and it would not be unreasonable to expect them to tolerate this.
Judgment
The Supreme Court, comprising Deputy President Lord Hope, Lords Rodger, Walker and Collins and Sir John Dyson, rejected the 'discretion test', finding that, according to Lord Hope, "to pretend that [a person's sexual orientation or sexuality] does not exist, or that the behaviour by which it manifests itself can be suppressed, is to deny the members of this group their fundamental right to be what they are."
Lord Rodger stated in their speech that a consideration of sexual identity should not be restricted to participation in particular sexual acts, but to all aspects of a person's life:
The cases were both remitted to the Tribunal for reconsideration taking into account the guidelines provided by the Supreme Court.

Horacio E. Esteves Orihuela Yaritagua, Yaracuy (6 July 1941 – 26 July 1996) was a Venezuelan sprinter who jointly held the 100 metres world record at 10.0s from 1964-8. Their record time was run on 15 August 1964 at the Estadio Nacional de "El Paraíso" in Caracas (now Brígido Iriarte Stadium), matching the time set by Armin Hary in 1960 and Harry Jerome in 1962. They were also a record holder in the 100-yard dash, at 9.2s.
They reached the semi-finals in the 100m at the 1960 Olympics, and the same year competed in the heats for Venezuela in the 4 X 100 m relay. A muscle strain prevented them from going to the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. They did not go beyond the heats in the 1968 Olympics 100m. Esteves competed in the 4×100 metres Relay at the 1963 Pan American Games winning a silver medal with Arquímedes Herrera, Héctor Thomas, and Rafael Romero. They finished fourth in the 100 meters at the 1963 Pan American Games.
They went to high school at the Aplicación Lyceum and Luis Espelozín schools. They received a degree in physical education from the Instituto Pedagógico de Caracas (now part of the Universidad Pedagógica Experimental Libertador. They did an MA in science, specializing in Planning and Nutrition, and then studied physiology of exercise at the Universidad de Los Andes and growth and development at the Universidad Simón Bolívar.

The 1953 New York Central Railroad accident occurred on the four-track mainline 2.4 miles east of Conneaut, Ohio at 10:02 P.M. on March 27, 1953. The accident sequence began when an improperly secured load of large pipes broke loose from a gondola car on an eastbound freight train. The loose pipe, dragged by the moving train, damaged the westbound passenger track. A passing westbound freight train crew notified the first train and stopped to assess what had happened. A fast westbound passenger train could not stop and derailed from the damaged track, colliding with the westbound freight on the adjacent track. Finally, an eastbound fast passenger train struck the derailed equipment from the first two trains. There were 21 deaths and 49 people were injured. This accident holds the record for the most trains involved in a single accident.
Site
The accident occurred on the main line of the Erie Division at a point 2.4 miles east of Conneaut and 1861 feet from the Ohio - Pennsylvania state line. This was on the famous Water Level Route, a four-track mainline where fast passenger trains from the Midwest ran on an almost gradeless route to New York. The main tracks here, from south to north, were designated as No. 4, eastward freight; No. 2, eastward passenger; No. 1, westward passenger; and No. 3, westward freight. It was raining at the time of the accident. The distance between the center-lines of adjacent tracks was 13 feet.
Accident
Trains involved
Extra 1871 East was an eastbound freight consisting of two diesel-electric units, 103 cars, and a caboose. It was moving on track No. 4 at a speed of 36 miles per hour.
Extra 1736 West was a westbound freight powered by two diesel-electric units pulling 120 cars and a caboose. It was moving on track No. 3 at a speed of 31 miles per hour.
No. 5, the New York to Chicago Mohawk, was a first-class passenger train consisting of two diesel-electric units and eleven cars: a mail car, two express cars, one baggage car, two coaches, one sleeping car, one club-sleeping car, two sleeping cars, and one observation-sleeping car. It was proceeding westbound on track No. 1 at a speed of 76 miles per hour.
No. 12, the St. Louis to New York Southwestern Limited, was also a first-class passenger train. It consisted of two diesel-electric units and twelve cars: one baggage-dormitory car, two coaches, one dining car, two sleeping cars, one coach, four sleeping cars, and one observation-sleeping car. It was traveling eastbound on track No. 2 at a speed of 71 miles per hour.
Events
Immediately east of the point where the accident occurred Extra 1871 East met Extra 1736 West moving on track No. 3. The flagman of Extra 1871 East observed the stop signals given with a white light from the rear platform of the caboose of the west-bound train. They acknowledged the signals and immediately informed their conductor. The brakes of the train were then applied from the caboose by the use of the conductor's valve. The train stopped with the front end in the vicinity of Springfield, Pa., 3.2 miles east of the point of the accident. The flagman immediately proceeded westward to provide flag protection and the conductor inspected the train.
The seventy-third car of 1871 East, Baltimore and Ohio gondola car #254645, was loaded with 58 pieces of pipe. Each pipe was approximately 35 feet long and 18 inches in diameter. The conductor found the side stakes had broken on the north side of the car and part of the lading had fallen from the car. They observed that the ends of high tension bands used to secure the load were trailing over the sides of the car, counted 49 pieces of pipe on the car, and later made a notation on the waybill that nine pieces of pipe were missing. After they completed their examination of the car they uncoupled it from the rear portion of the train and instructed the front brakeman to assist in the movements necessary to set out the car on an adjacent auxiliary track. Before the car was set out they communicated by telephone with the train dispatcher to inform them of the delay to their train and that some pipe pieces were missing from the car. The dispatcher then informed them that the accident had occurred.
The crew of Extra 1736 West approached the point of the accident on track No. 3 at a speed of 31 miles per hour. When the locomotive passed the point at which the accident occurred, the crew did not observe any defective condition of the tracks or any obstruction on or near the tracks. The flagman proceeded to the rear platform of the caboose to inspect Extra 1871 East moving on track No. 4. They observed sparks flying from the vicinity of the running gear of a car about midway of that train. When its caboose passed, they gave stop signals with a white light which were acknowledged. They then entered the caboose and informed their conductor of the defective condition they had observed
Immediately afterward, No. 5, moving on track No. 1, was approaching the point where the accident occurred at a speed of 76 miles per hour. The train was moving on a curve to the right and was passing Extra 1736 West moving on track No. 3. The engineer then observed that the track immediately in front of their locomotive had been shifted northward toward track No. 3. Before they could move the brake valve to the emergency position, the locomotive was derailed and collided with Extra 1736 West. At about the same time the locomotive of No. 12 passed the locomotive of No. 5.
As No. 12 was approaching the point where the accident occurred at 71 miles per hour. The engineer made an emergency application of the brakes when the locomotive was passing the locomotive of No. 5. The firefighter observed fire flying as derailed equipment obstructed track No. 2 immediately in front of the locomotive. The collision occurred before the speed of the train was materially reduced. No. 12's locomotive and the first 10 cars were derailed and collided with Extra 1736 West.
The seventy-sixth car of 1736 West was struck by the derailed locomotive and equipment of No. 5 and the seventy-fifth to the ninetieth cars, inclusive, were derailed. Immediately after the collision occurred, the derailed equipment of No. 5 which obstructed track No. 2 was struck by train No. 12. The derailed cars of Extra 1736 West stopped in various positions on or near the westward main tracks. The seventy-eighth, eighty-first, eighty-second and eighty-fourth cars were destroyed. The seventy-sixth, seventy-seventh, and eightieth cars were badly damaged and the other derailed cars of this train were somewhat damaged.
A separation occurred between the locomotive and the first car of No. 5. The diesel-electric units remained coupled and stopped about in line with the track and with the front end about 740 feet west of the point of the accident. Both diesel-electric units were badly damaged. Separation occurred at each end of each of the first six cars and these cars stopped in various positions on and across the tracks and intermingled with the derailed equipment of Extra 1736 West. The seventh car stopped with the front end against derailed equipment on track No. 3 and the rear end on the train structure of track No. 1 end the other derailed cars stopped in line with that track. The first six cars were destroyed and the other derailed cars of this train were badly damaged.
The locomotive and the first nine cars of No. 12 derailed. Separation occurred between the locomotives and the first car. The locomotive units stopped in diagonal positions with the front end of the first unit south of the westward main tracks and about 95 feet east of the point of the accident. The second unit stopped at right angles to the tracks and with the front end against the left rear corner of the first unit. Both units were badly damaged. The first four cars stopped in diagonal positions intermingled with the derailed cars of the other two trains and the other derailed cars stopped about in line with the track. The first two cars were destroyed and the other derailed cars of this train were badly damaged.
Rescue effort
The accident site was isolated from any main road. Only a muddy dirt lane led from the crash site to a major road two miles south, and it soon became blocked by vehicles mired in the mud. The injured were either carried on stretchers or moved by hand car to the nearest road. Some waited up to four hours for help. About 100 persons were treated on the scene and 62 were transported to hospitals.
Investigation
The Interstate Commerce Commission investigated the accident. Their findings indicated that the lading of Baltimore and Ohio car 254645 on Train Extra 1871 East was not properly secured for movement when loaded because the high tension bands were not properly sealed. Because the load was not properly secured, nine sections of pipe fell from the car while in transit. When the pipes fell from the car in question, one piece wedged between the track structure of track No. 1 and the next car, a boxcar. As the train proceeded at a speed of 36 miles per hour the resultant thrust transmitted by the pipe to track No. 1 moved track No. 1 northward a distance of about 18 inches before the pipe fell clear of the cars. The damaged condition of the track was not observed before passenger train No. 5 arrived at the point of the accident. The track was sufficiently damaged to cause the derailment of train No. 5 which in turn caused the derailment of Extra 1736 West. Passenger train No. 12 struck the derailed equipment of passenger train No. 5 before protection could be provided.

The 1992–93 season was Dynamo Dresden's third season in the Bundesliga, and they finished in 15th place, just above the relegation zone. Although Dynamo were never in the relegation places at any point during the season, they were let down by a lack of goals - they were the division's lowest scorers with 32, and no player managed more than six goals all season. This situation was probably not helped by the departure of last season's top scorer Torsten Gütschow to Galatasaray, midway through the season, although one positive was the emergence of future-UEFA Champions League winner Alexander Zickler, one of a number of youth team products promoted to the first team this season.
Dynamo reached the second round of the DFB-Pokal, being eliminated by VfB Leipzig of the 2. Bundesliga in a Saxony derby.

Fabrizio Comencini (born 6 November 1953, in Garda) is an Italian politician.
Comencini started their political career in the Italian Social Movement (MSI), for which they were elected to the Regional Council of Veneto in 1985 and 1990. In the early 1990s, during their second term in the Council, they switched to Liga Veneta–Lega Nord. In 1994 they were elected secretary of the party and in 1995 they were re-elected to the Council. During their tenure as leader, Lega Nord had its best electoral result so far in Veneto and in any other region, scoring 29.7% of the vote at the 1996 general election.
In 1998 Comencini broke with Umberto Bossi in the name of Venetian nationalism as opposed to Padanian nationalism. Although they commanded a majority of Liga Veneta's regional councillors (7 out of 9: Ettore Beggiato, Alessio Morosin, Mariangelo Foggiato, Alberto Poirè, Michele Munaretto, Franco Roccon and himself), Comencini was not supported by the majority of Liga Veneta who supported Gian Paolo Gobbo instead. They thus resigned as national secretary and formed a new party called Liga Veneta Repubblica (later Veneti d'Europa, Liga Fronte Veneto and finally, again, Liga Veneta Repubblica).
Most recently, Comencini ran in the 2015 regional election for Independence We Veneto (in support of Luca Zaia's second term as President), but was not elected.

Production
There had been several attempts to make films based on Rolfe Boldrewood's 1888 novel since the bushranging ban by the New South Wales government in 1912. In particular there were attempts by Stanley Crick in 1916 and Alfred Rolfe in 1918. However Kenneth Brampton managed to secure permission for this 1920 version, mostly likely because it stressed the moral lessons of the story.
Kenneth Brampton and actor Tien Hogue managed to persuade the mining magnate Pearson Tewksbury to raise the budget and act as producer.
Brampton was acting in the play Lightnin''' which they left to make the film.
The film was shot on location at Braidwood and in the Araluen Valley near Canberra. The bushrangers the Clarke brothers reportedly worked in this region.
Renowned horseman "Top" Hassall doubled for Brampton on the horse riding scenes.
Future director Charles Chauvel was working around the Sydney studios and attending to horses on the film. They have a bit part.
The film was the final acting role for Roy Redgrave who died in 1922.
Reception
The movie was reportedly successful at the box office and grossed up to £16,000. However returns were so slow and the distributor and exhibitor took so much that Pearson Tewksbury was dissuaded from further film production.Variety'' said the film was "of only fair quality, the picture just gets by."
Preservation status
A "copy comprising about three-quarters of the film" was found and combined with already known footage to produce a near-complete version. A five-minute sequence is still missing.

Latinos '08 is a PBS documentary that examines the political influence of Latinos through the lens of the 2008 presidential election. Since 2008, shifting demographics in the United States are reshaping elections, changing the political landscape, and impacting policy at the federal, state, and local levels. Latinos and other racial/ethnic groups are challenging the ways in which politicians, academics and other cultural influencers consider and discuss race by upending this country's black/white racial binary paradigm.
Latinos '08 features interviews with a wide range of prominent Latinos, including Henry Cisneros, consultant Lionel Sosa, columnist Ruben Navarrette Jr., Federico Peña, Ana Navarro, Leslie Sanchez, Luis Cortés of Esperanza USA, and academics Lisa García Bedolla of University of California at Berkeley, Rodolfo de la Garza of Columbia University, Roberto Suro of the University of Southern California and Luis Fraga of the University of Washington.
Production
Latinos '08 was produced and directed by Phillip Rodriguez, an award-winning documentary filmmaker based in Los Angeles. In 2002, Rodriguez founded City Projects, a production company whose films and educational programs challenge ideas about race and diversity in America. Rodriguez' documentary films bring to light the complexities of Latino culture, history, and identity at a time when our nation's demographics reflect unprecedented growth in the Latino community and the concomitant demand for relevant storytelling.
Reception
Latinos '08 received several reviews, including in the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the San Diego Union Tribune, and a 2009 CINE Golden Eagle Award for Best News Analysis.
The Washington Post:
One of the best things about the new PBS documentary Latinos '08 ... is that it challenges a premise of such efforts—the assumption that the Latino vote is a monolithic bloc that can be appealed to and delivered as one. The film commits an even more refreshing heresy: It questions whether the Latino vote really is as critical as everyone says it is ... Yet credit the higher truth-telling of this brisk, brief (one-hour) political, demographic and cultural tour that it also resists taking refuge in easy contrarianism, which is as overly simple as the conventional wisdom. Rather than present us with a neat package of the Latino influence as either-or, this-or-that, it unwraps the package and reveals something with more to it than many presume.
The New York Times:
[T]his zippy little film about the Hispanic vote in the current American presidential election isn't afraid to turn conventional wisdom on its head, including the conventional wisdom that there is even such a thing as a Hispanic vote.
The San Diego-Union Tribune:
One thing [Latinos '08] makes clear is that this subject is much more nuanced and complicated than many people imagine. For instance, most Latinos are registered Democrats, but they have shown a willingness to support moderate Republicans without surrendering their party affiliation. They come from different countries, advocate different agendas, and represent different generations, social status, education levels, and political philosophies. And yet they have also demonstrated they can come together as one community when they're under attack, as many Latinos claim is true with the immigration issue ... Director Philip Rodriguez has done a masterful job of drawing the complexities of Latino voters in ways that help us better understand America.

Fabrika reznog alata (abbr. FRA; full legal name: Akcionarsko društvo Fabrika reznog alata Čačak) is a Serbian tool manufacturing company, which is in bankruptcy procedure since October 2021. Its headquarters is in Čačak, Serbia. With around 480 employees as of 2020, it was one of the largest employers at the time in Čačak and Moravica District.
History
Founded on 1 June 1953, the company originally focused on the production of carvers and taps. Since 1960, the company expanded its production to other threading tools, and tools for working openings and cutters. In the 1970s, the company was reorganized, and new production programs were established for particular types of tools and plants for production services. In May 1993, the company was at its peak of production, with more than 3350 employees.
Due to the breakup of Yugoslavia and the sanctions which were put into the effect during the 1990s, the company has begun to deteriorate. This is also due to the lack of good subcontractors, lack of investments in production facilities and various lawsuits based on unpaid wages.
However, the company has survived and continued to work in the 2000s with much reduced profitability. With more than 500 employees, it has gone through many financial problems and it is still recovering. In April 2007, it was submitted to the OTC market at the Belgrade Stock Exchange.
Since April 2010, the company is undergoing restructuring. Its main objectives are changes in the internal organization of the company and the clearance of arrears, in order to create conditions for the eventual privatization.
In May 2013, the company celebrated its 60th anniversary. In October 2021, the bankruptcy procedure over company was opened, due to insolvency and debt.
Activity
The company exports its products to many countries, including the United States, Russia, Iran and Poland.

Jørgen Pedersen (1914–1978) was an Epidemiologist.  They are known for their hypothesis concerning the correlation of hyperglycemia during pregnancy and disease in later life.
Life and work
In 1952 they formulated the hypothesis that hyperglycemia in pregnant women might lead to hyperglycemia in their fetuses, causing complications in infancy and later life.
Hyperglycemia in pregnancy is associated with unfavorable fetal and neonatal outcomes, since an increased maternal blood sugar value correlated with increased fetal insulin levels and is involved so directly to the development of diabetic foetopathy.
To consume sugar, soft drinks and sugary-sweetened foods is significantly positively correlated with a risk of a pathologically increased amount of glucose in the blood and diabetes.
The annual Joergen Pedersen Lecture, in honor of Pedersen, has been established by the Diabetic Pregnancy Study Group of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes since 1980.

Sir John Ritchie Findlay, 1st Baronet, (13 January 1866 – 13 April 1930), a Scotsman, was the owner of the business that published The Scotsman, a philanthropist, and later in life Lord Lieutenant of Banffshire.
Family and education
John Ritchie Findlay was born in Edinburgh, the eldest son of J. Ritchie Findlay, of Aberlour, and Susan (née Leslie). Their father was a nephew of the founder of The Scotsman, so on their father's death in 1898, they became the principal partner in Messrs. John Ritchie and Co., the proprietors and publishers of The Scotsman and its associated newspapers.
They were educated first at Mr Oliphant's School on Charlotte Square then the Edinburgh Collegiate School before going to Harrow School in 1879, where they were a contemporary of Stanley Baldwin and of John Galsworthy. From Harrow they passed to Balliol College, Oxford, where they graduated from MA with double honours, in Natural Science and in Literae Humaniores. Edinburgh University later gave them an honorary doctorate (LLD).
They were a breeder of pedigree Aberdeen Angus cattle on their family estate at Aberlour.
In 1898 they were elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Their proposers were John McLaren, Lord McLaren, Sir Arthur Mitchell, Sir John Batty Tuke, and Ralph Copeland.
They were Master of the Merchant Company of Edinburgh 1913-14. They sat on the Ancient Monuments Board and the Fine Art Commission for Scotland. They had a large private collection of scientific instruments.
Findlay died at their residence, 3 Rothesay Terrace in Edinburgh, survived by their wife, three sons and two daughters. Their heir was their eldest son Edmund Findlay.
 They are buried on the northern wall of the 20th-century extension to Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh in the modern equivalent of the "Lords Row" as found in the original cemetery.
Family
In 1901 they married Harriet Jane, daughter of Sir Jonathon Backhouse, of Darlington. Their eldest son was Edmund Findlay.
Obituary
Sir John Findlay was an enlightened and progressive newspaper proprietor with a high ideal of the moral responsibility of the Press to the public. Their newspaper interests, however, absorbed only part of their activities. They never entered the competitive arena of local or national politics, but their services were much sought after on semi-public administrative boards and public committees, and they gave of themselves in that work. Findlay was particularly interested in the furtherance and encouragement of art and archaeology, in which they followed in the footsteps of is father, the donor to the nation of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. Sir John was Chairman of the Board of Trustees for the National Galleries of Scotland, and for a long time Chairman of the Edinburgh College of Art. Their antiquarian interests found an outlet in their position as Vice-Chairman of the Scottish Ancient Monuments Board, and they were also an original member of the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland. They gave useful service to Scottish education as a member of the Advisory Council to the Scottish Education Department, and they undertook a very heavy task a few years ago when they became Chairman of the Scottish Advisory Committee on the Rivers Pollution.
On the outbreak of World War I they were invited by the Government to become Chairman of the Scottish National Housing Company, which was entrusted with the construction of housing at Rosyth, then the new naval base. Sir John's success in this enterprise led to theirs being asked by the last Unionist Government to form a company to accelerate house building in Scotland by the construction of steel houses. Many of these activities they were carrying on simultaneously — a heavy burden even for a stronger man physically. They never complained, however and their ability and self-sacrificing zeal won them not only the admiration but the personal esteem and good will of is colleagues and all who were brought into contact with him. Reserved and reticent, they never sought publicity, but many knew them as the soul of honour and integrity, as a man on whose judgment and discretion they could implicitly rely. Lady Findlay ably supported their husband in their public work and was themselves Chairman of the Scottish Unionist Association two years ago, the first woman to hold that office.
''Sir John was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1917 and created a Baronet, of Aberlour in the County of Banff, in 1925. After fulfilling the role of Deputy Lieutenant, in 1928 they were appointed to Lord Lieutenant of Banffshire, the county in which Aberlour, the family estate is situated. They were an honorary Royal Scottish Academy and an honorary LL.D. of Edinburgh University.

Perry River Dam is a dam in Queensland, Australia, located south west of Bundaberg. The dam is a roller compacted concrete embankment 12m high and 104m long. From a catchment area of 98 km2 it impounds a maximum of 1,050 megalitres.
The dam was constructed in 1996 to provide a water supply to Mt Rawdon Gold Mine, located 5km south-west of the dam. The Mt Rawdon project was acquired from Resolute and Samson Exploration by Equigold NL in 1998 and commenced production in February 2001. Since November 2011 the mine has been owned and operated by Evolution Mining. The 2018 Melbourne Cup trophy was made with gold from the Mt Rawdon mine.
The Mt Rawdon mine is expected to complete operations in 2027, investigations are underway to use the mine pit as part of a pumped hydroelectric development, likely involving water diverted from the Perry River Dam.

José Chávez Morado (4 January 1909 – 1 December 2002) was a Mexican artist who was associated with the Mexican muralism movement of the 20th century. Their generation followed that of Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. Although Chávez Morado took classes in California and Mexico, they are considered to be mostly self-taught. They experimented with various materials, and was an early user of Italian mosaic in monumental works. Their major works include murals at the Ciudad Universitaria, Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes and Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City as well as frescos at the Alhóndiga de Granaditas, which took twelve years to paint. From the 1940s on, they also worked as a cultural promoter, establishing a number of cultural institutions especially in their home state of Guanajuato including the Museo de Arte Olga Costa - José Chávez Morado, named after themselves and their wife, artist Olga Costa.
Life
Chávez Morado was born on 4 January 1909 in Silao, Guanajuato, shortly before the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution. Their father was a merchant, José Ignacio Chávez Montes de Oca; their mother was Luz Morado Cabrera. They came from a modest family; however, their grandfather was in possession of a private library of over 5,000 volumes which had been collected by their grandparents and great grandparents. The illustrations in those books provided the child with their first exposure to art; when they were small, they spent time copying them, especially illustrations from La Ilustración Española.
Their mother died when they were a teenager, and at age 16, they began to work at the Silao electrical company, Compañia de Luz. They lost this job when they drew a caricature of their boss. They then went to work at the national railway company, Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México, which allowed them to travel some of the Mexican countryside. In 1925 they emigrated to the United States, where they worked on citrus farms in California and even went to Alaska to work in salmon fishing on the island of Tonepek. During this time they still drew, mostly likenesses of their coworkers. They returned to California from Alaska, taking various jobs to be able to take classes at the Chouinard School of Arts. At this time they met José Clemente Orozco who was painting the mural "Prometeo" at Pomona College.
In 1930, they returned to Silao. Their father gave them a store to run. At the counter, they would draw images of the customers and other typical people, which they sold when the store closed and they moved to Mexico City. They entered the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes (now the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas, associating with the more politically active artists on the left.) They took engraving classes with Francisco de León, painting with Bulmaro Guzmán, and lithography with Emilio Amero. At the Centro Popular de Pintura "Saturnino Herrán" they met Leopoldo Méndez, whose posters they had taken from the streets to decorate their room.
They also met Olga Costa, who was born in Leipzig, Germany, the daughter of Russian émigré musician Jacob Kostakowsky. They married in 1935.
During their art career, Chávez Morado was politically active as a member of the Mexican Communist Party and with a number of communist and socialist artists' groups.
In 1949, they studied abroad in Europe and Cuba.
In their later life, they and their wife resided for a time in San Miguel de Allende, then moved permanently to the city of Guanajuato in 1966. They became avid collectors of Mexican handcrafts and folk art, archeological pieces, books and plants. They also sponsored numerous cultural events until their death. In 1975 they decided to donate their collection of pre-Hispanic art to the Museo Regional de la Alhóndga de Granaditas and their collection of colonial and folk art to the Museo del Pueblo in Guanajuato.
Chávez Morado died on 1 December 2002 at the age of 93 of respiratory failure. Their funeral was at the Museo del Pueblo. At the time of their death, they were considered to be the "last of the Mexican muralists."
Career
Chávez Morado was a painter, engraver, muralist and cultural promoter during their career. They also worked to support educational institutions in the state of Guanajuato.
They established their art career in the 1930s, starting by teaching drawing classes in primary and secondary schools in 1933. They were named chief of the Fine Arts Section of the Department of Fine Arts of the Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP) in 1935, and later gave classes in drawing at the Escuela de Pintura y Escultura of the SEP in the 1940s. They also are a professor of lithography at the Escuela de Artes del Libro. Their students included Felipe Ehrenberg, Luis Nishizawa and Greta Dale . They also did illustration work early in their career such as six linoleum engravings for the Vida nocturna de la Ciudad de México book by Ediciones de Arte Mexicano.
Their main creations as an artist were murals. Their first public work was La lucha antiimperialista! at the Teachers' College in Xalapa, Veracruz in 1935. Other early murals include one for the Multifamiliar Doctores of the ISSSTE and the Teachers' College in Guadalajara, both of which were created with glass pieces. Starting in 1952, they created three murals at the Ciudad Universitaria in Mexico City called El regreso de Quetzalcóatl (The return of Quetzalcoatl), La conquista de la energía (The conquest of energy) and La ciencia y el trabajo (Science and work). All are in the Alfonso Caso Auditorium with the first two made of glass pieces. El retorno de Quetzalcoatl and La conquista de la energia are outside of the usual social and political themes of their work, but with La ciencia y el trabajo, they returned to examining social issues, this time in relation to the science building of the Ciudad Universitaria itself, which was designed by Mexico City architect Eugenio Peschard. It is not popular with those at the university but it is sought out by foreign tourists. It shows how the farmworkers of the expropriated haciendas were used in the construction of the university as well as the architects and engineers who designed it, as well as the Van de Graaff generator which was a centerpiece of the university in the 1950s. This last work was created on the vestibule of the Auditorium with a vinyl substance. Its location has made this piece subject to damage from humidity and vandalism. In 1954 they created mosaic murals for the Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes building, made of tile and colored stone. From 1955 to 1967 they painted fresco murals inside the Alhóndigas de Granaditas. This work was partially funded by a fundraising drive resulting in 250,000 Mexican schoolchildren donating twenty cents each. In 1964 they painted panels with Mesoamerican themes for the Museo Nacional de Antropología.
Chávez Morado's cultural promotions began in the 1940s. They founded and directed the Espiral Gallery and was a founding member of the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana. In 1948 they were a founding member of the Sociedad para el Impulso de las Artes Plásticas and two years later founded the Taller de Integración Plástica. In 1951, they designed scenery and costumes for the ballet performances called La manda and El sueño y la presencia. They established a number of museums in their home state of Guanajuato including the Alhóndigas de Granaditas Regional Museum, Casa del Arte José y Tomás Chávez Morado in Silao, the José Chávez Morado Library at the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (donating their personal collection of art books) and the Museo de Arte Olga Costa - José Chávez Morado. The last is located at a farm which was part of a larger 17th century hacienda in a house where the couple had previously lived. Inaugurated in 1993, the museum´s ground floor contains the permanent collections which includes furniture, ceramics, glass, plaster of paris, altarpieces and masks. It includes an important collection of over 500 pre Hispanic pieces, and over seventy pieces by Chávez Morado and Olga Costa.
During their career, Chávez Morado was involved in leftist politics, which influenced their art. In the 1930s, they joined the Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios. The Liga edited a print album, Estampas del Golfo, which carried ten of their wood engravings. In 1937 they traveled as part of a committee of Mexican intellectuals which included Silvestre Revueltas, Juan de la Cabada, Octavio Paz, Carlos Pellicer, Elena Garro and José Mancisidor to Spain to support the Republicans. In 1938, they joined the Taller de Gráfica Popular, leaving in 1941. In 1941, they collaborated with La Voz de México, drawing cartoons under the pseudonym 'Juan Brochas'. They used the pseudonym 'Chon' to make illustrations for the weekly "Combate" headed by Narciso Bassols. In early 1942, they published four editions of a newspaper/poster called El Eje-Le, which was a publication of the Artistas Libres de México. In the 1940s, they were the secretary general of the Fine Arts Professors' Union, which made non-commercial engravings with socialist messages to paste on poles outside. They had to do this activity at night as they were subject to attack by reactionaries such as the Camisas Doradas (Golden Shirts).
Later work included the reliefs on the column of the "umbrella" structure in the center of the Museo Nacional de Antropología in 1964, a monument to Benito Juárez on the Guadalajara-Colima highway in the 1970s, and the copper grilling on the façade of the new Legislative Palace in Mexico City.
Their artistic legacy consists of over 2,000 works, including murals, other monumental works, etchings and paintings. Their first exhibition was in 1944 at the Galería de Arte Mexicano. After that, their works were shown at the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes, the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia and the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico as well as abroad. In 1976, they exhibited their drawing work for the first time at the José Clemente Orozco Gallery in Zona Rosa, with the title of Apuntes de mi libreta, which were later published in a book of the same name. Their works can be found in the collections of the Museo de Antropologia, UNAM, Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, the Alhóndiga de Granaditas, Museo del Pueblo, the Olga Costa Chávez Morado Museum, Museo de los hermanos Tomás y José Chávez Morado and in private collections around the world.
They received their first recognition for their work in 1945 when they won first prize at a graphics competition sponsored by the Mexico City government for the 25th anniversary of the Mexican Revolution. In the 1950s, they began to receive accolades and appointments to art commissions. They received the Premio Nacional de Arte from the Mexican government in 1974. In 1985, they were admitted into the Academia de Artes and received an honorary doctorate from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. They were also the vice president for Latin America of the World Crafts Council of UNESCO and a member emeritus of the Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte . Their last homage while they were alive was at the Festival Internacional Cervantino. A retrospective of their work was hosted in Cadiz in 2012 on the 10th anniversary of their death.
Artistry
Chávez Morado created engravings, illustrations, cartoon drawings, sculpture, murals, canvas painting, frescos, bronze, glass, and was one of the first Mexican artists to work with Italian mosaic on monumental works. Although they had some training in California and Mexico, they are considered to be mostly self-taught. They were interested in experimenting with new techniques and materials for murals. Their work ranged from traditional frescos to those made with vinyl, mosaics, stone, bronze and terracotta.
Their work was always figurative in the style of Mexican muralism also known as the Escuela Mexicana de Pintura.  They are grouped with contemporaries such as Juan O'Gorman, Raúl Anguiano and Alfredo Zalce as the generation of the school to follow Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros . Like the others, Chávez Morado promoted the social and political principles of the Mexican Revolution. They believed that art should be esthetic and political and was both politically active and an artist. Their work emphasized faith in the masses, the exaltation of the struggle and heroes of the Mexican Revolution, popular culture and the railroad. Their painting tended to emphasize the human form, with depictions of rural areas in Mexico, customs, dances and folk religion. By the mid 20th century, their politics and art became militant and communist, as can best be seen in their engravings and the work they did with the Taller de Gráfica Popular.

Weidemann GmbH is a multinational agricultural machinery company based in Diemelsee-Flechtdorf in the district of Waldeck-Frankenberg in Hesse, Germany. It produces Hoftracs, wheel loaders, telescopic wheel loaders and telehandlers, which are preferably used on farmland for feeding, scattering, fertilising, loading and stacking. The company has sites in Diemelsee-Flechtdorf and Korbach, and is part of the Wacker Neuson group.
History
Maschinenfabrik Weidemann KG was founded in 1960 in Diemelsee-Flechtdorf (Hesse, Germany). From 1960 to 1972, the company focused on production of farmyard equipment and dung removal equipment. In 1972, Weidemann invented the Hoftrac farm crane. This small, articulated machine was specifically designed for narrow and low farmyard buildings.
In 1979, the company was renamed as Weidemann GmbH & Co. KG. Weidemann continued to expand over the next few years. In the early 1990s, the first foreign affiliate was established in the Netherlands and operations commenced at plant III in Gotha (Thuringia, Germany).
In 2005, the company then known as Wacker Construction Equipment AG (now Wacker Neuson SE) acquired Weidemann. This involved a further expansion of production capacity. The production plant in Korbach was completed in 2007. Since then, Weidemann GmbH has been a wholly owned affiliate of Wacker Neuson SE.
Weidemann machines are sold in over 30 countries worldwide by in-house organisations in close cooperation with specialist dealers. Since 1960, Weidemann has produced more than 65,000 machines (up to 2011).
In April 2021, the traditional location in Diemelsee-Flechtdorf was abandoned with the move into a new administration building, training center and technology center. The company location is therefore entirely in Korbach.

WGAD (930 AM) is a radio station licensed to serve Rainbow City, Alabama, United States. It operates at 930 kilohertz, with a daytime power of 5,000 watts non-directional, and 500 watts directional at night. Established in 1951, the station is currently owned by Jeff Beck and the broadcast license is held by Gadsden Radio Media, LLC.
Programming
WGAD broadcasts an oldie format to the greater Gadsden, Alabama, area. Weekend programming features special shows from Scott Shannon, Dick Bartley, and Gadsdens' own Bob Mayben. July 2007 when the station changed formats, they launched a live and local morning show. The show maintained the same host but changed co-hosts several times before the show was taken off the air in November 2008.
History
The 930 frequency came to Gadsden when local druggist "Doc" Cary Graham put WETO on the air in 1950. WETO operated with 1,000 watts daytime only. In 1963 Gadsden radio veteran Charlie "B" Boman bought the station from Mr. Graham, and began a series of upgrades, both to the station and its image. From its original location in the rear of "Doc's" drug store, Boman moved to the Life of Alabama Insurance building on the main street of town, and installed all new equipment. Boman had begun their radio career at the original WJBY, and found those call letters to be available, so the heritage call returned to the air at the 930 spot on the dial, late in 1963. Boman also raised the power to 5,000 watts, while still a daytime station. In the early to middle seventies, the station enjoyed popularity as a contemporary music station under Program Director Bob Mayben, who patterned the presentation after pop stations in large markets. In the late 1970s Boman sold WJBY to Hinton Mitchem and Gordon Henderson, who added the night time signal and erected four new towers.
In 2011, the station was sold to Jeff Beck.
Frequency swap
On October 4, 2007, the WJBY call sign was moved from 930 AM to 1350 AM while sister station WGAD in Gadsden had its call sign moved from 1350 AM to 930 AM. In October 2010, the stations began the process to regain their original (prior to 2007) call letters. The station on 930 AM went dark on October 10, 2010, and regained the "WJBY" call sign on January 19, 2011. WJBY resumed normal broadcast operations on September 12, 2011. On September 20, 2012, the station changed its call sign back to WGAD.
On August 30, 2013 WGAD changed their format to adult hits, and in 2015 moved to a broad oldies format.

Francis IV Joseph Charles Ambrose Stanislaus (Italian: Francesco IV Giuseppe Carlo Ambrogio Stanislao d'Asburgo-Este; 6 October 1779 – 21 January 1846) was Duke of Modena, Reggio, and Mirandola (from 1815), Duke of Massa and Prince of Carrara (from 1829), Archduke of Austria-Este, Royal Prince of Hungary and Bohemia, Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece.
Biography
Francis was born in Milan. Their father was Ferdinand Karl, Archduke of Austria-Este and Duke of Breisgau, their mother Maria Beatrice d'Este, Duchess of Massa and Princess of Carrara, Lady of Lunigiana.
They were a grandson of Maria Theresa of Austria, head of the House of Habsburg, and was heir to the Modenese branch of the House of Este through their mother. They thus became the first member of the House of Habsburg-Este to rule the Este inheritance in Northern Italy.
Francis is distinguished for their stern and tyrannic rule by which they repressed all the democratic movements appearing during their reign, particularly following a major revolt in 1830. The harshness of the Ducal policies are illustrated by the hanging of Ciro Menotti for an attempted insurrection against the Duke (1831).
Family
In 1812, Francis married their niece the Princess Maria Beatrice of Savoy, who was the daughter of their sister Archduchess Maria Teresa of Austria-Este and King Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia. The couple had four children:
Maria Theresa (1817–1886), married Henri, comte de Chambord.
Francis V, Duke of Modena (1819–1875), married Princess Adelgunde of Bavaria.
Ferdinand Karl (1821–1849), married Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria. Father of Maria Theresia, Archduchess of Austria-Este.
Maria Beatrix (1824–1906), married Infante Juan de Bourbon, Count of Montizón.

The Vectrex is a vector display-based home video game console–the only one ever designed and released for the home market, developed by Smith Engineering. It was first released for the North America market in November 1982 and then Europe and Japan in 1983. Originally manufactured by General Consumer Electronics, it was later licensed to Milton Bradley after they acquired the company. Bandai released the system in Japan.
The Vectrex, in contrast to other video game systems at the time, does not need to be hooked up to a television set. It has an integrated monochrome CRT monitor. A detachable wired control pad can be folded into the lower base of the console. Games came with translucent color overlays to place over the screen. Peripherals include a pair of 3D goggles known as the "3D Imager" and a light pen for drawing directly on the screen. The Asteroids-inspired Mine Storm is built into the system.
The console was conceived by John Ross, of Smith Engineering, in late 1980 as a handheld called the "Mini Arcade". It morphed into a tabletop system that was manufactured by General Consumer Electronics. Strong initial sales caused General Consumer Electronics to be acquired by Milton Bradley. The Vectrex was a victim of the video game crash of 1983 and was discontinued in 1984.
Despite its commercial failure, the Vectrex was praised for its software library, unique graphical capabilities, and built-in monitor. Several publications lauded it as one of the best consoles available at the time. The Vectrex was the first console to have a 3D-based peripheral. A color handheld version of the Vectrex was conceived in the late 1980s, but was shelved because of its manufacturing cost and the success of the Nintendo Game Boy.
History
The Vectrex was conceived by John Ross of Smith Engineering in late 1980. He, Mike Purvis, Tom Sloper, and Steve Marking had gone to Electro-Mavin, a surplus warehouse in Los Angeles. They found a 1-inch cathode ray tube (CRT) and wondered if a small electronic game could be made of it. A demonstration of a vector-drawing cathode ray tube display was made by connecting the deflection yoke in a standard television to the channels of a stereo amplifier fed with music program material. An auxiliary yoke was used to keep the raster television's horizontal fly-back high-voltage system running. The demo led to a system originally conceived as a handheld called the Mini Arcade but, as Smith Engineering shopped the idea around to developers, it evolved into a tabletop with nine-inch screen.
The system was licensed to General Consumer Electronics in 1981. After a brief hardware and software development period, the Vectrex was unveiled on 7 June 1982 at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. It was publicly released in November at a retail price of US$199, just in time for the holidays. The launch sales were strong enough that Milton Bradley bought out General Consumer Electronics in early 1983.
Milton Bradley's greater resources allowed the Vectrex to be released in parts of Europe by mid-1983 and, through a co-branding agreement with Bandai, in Japan as well. However, the video game crash of 1983 turned Milton Bradley's support of the Vectrex into a costly mistake, even despite reducing its price by 25% and then later 50% in desperation to sell units. In February 1984, after losing $31.6 million on the Vectrex, Milton Bradley announced the discontinuation of the console and cancelled development of new games. The company's entire inventory of consoles and accessories was sold off to mass-market discount houses, where they were liquidated at a fraction of the console's introductory price. By May 1984, Milton Bradley merged with Hasbro and after-market support ended.
Prior to the Vectrex's discontinuation, a successor console with a color screen had been planned. After the rights reverted to Smith Engineering, the company made plans to revive the Vectrex as a handheld, but the imminent arrival of Nintendo's Game Boy put an end to those plans. In the mid-1990s, Jay Smith, then head of Smith Engineering, allowed new hardware and software development on a fee- and royalty-free basis. Smith has also allowed duplication of the original Vectrex software on a not-for-profit basis to allow Vectrex owners to obtain the original titles at low cost or for free.

The computer and vector generator were designed by Gerry Karr. The computer runs the game's computer code, watches the user's inputs, runs the sound generator, and controls the vector generator to make the screen drawings. The vector generator is an all-analog design using two integrators: X and Y. The computer sets the integration rates using a digital-to-analog converter. The computer controls the integration time by momentarily closing electronic analog switches within the operational-amplifier based integrator circuits. Voltage ramps are produced that the monitor uses to steer the electron beam over the face of the phosphor screen of the cathode ray tube. Another signal is generated that controls the brightness of the line.
The cathode ray tube is a Samsung model 240RB40 monochrome unit measuring 9 × 11 inches, displaying a picture of 240 mm diagonal; it is an off-the-shelf picture tube manufactured for small black/white television sets. The brightness of the CRT is controlled using a circular knob on the back of the display. A vector CRT display such as the one in the Vectrex does not require a special tube, and differs from standard raster-based television sets only in the control circuits. Rather than use sawtooth waves to direct the internal electron beam in a raster pattern, computer-controlled integrators feed linear amplifiers to drive the deflection yoke. This yoke has similar, if not identical inductances, unlike a TV deflection yoke. The yoke uses a standard TV core. The high-voltage transformer also uses a standard core and bobbin. There is special circuitry to turn off the electron beam if the vector generator stops or fails. This prevents burning of the screen's phosphors. This design is a great deal smaller than the electronics found in the free-standing, full-sized Asteroids arcade machine.
During development, for a short period of time, the possibility of using the 6502 processor was considered, but later its performance was considered insufficient.
Early units have a very audible "buzzing" from the built-in speaker that reacts to the graphics generated on screen. This is due to improper production grounding of signal lines of the low-level audio circuitry, and was eventually resolved in later production models. A "ground loop" had been created by a grounding strap added in production to meet U.S. Federal Communications Commission signal radiation requirements. This idiosyncrasy has become a familiar characteristic of the machine.
Peripherals
The 3-D Imager, invented by John Ross, turns the 2-D black-and-white images drawn by the Vectrex into a color 3-D experience. The imager works by spinning a disk in front of the viewer's eyes. The disk is black for 180 degrees and in some cases has 60 degree wedges of transparent red, green, and blue filters. The user looks through this to the Vectrex screen. The Vectrex synchronizes the rotation of the disk to the software frame rate as it draws 6 screens: with the right eye covered: the left eye red image, then green, and then the blue image is drawn, and then, while the left eye is covered by the black 180-degree sector: the right eye red, green, and then the blue image is drawn. Only one eye will see the Vectrex screen and its 3 associated images (or colors) at any one time while the other will be blocked by the 180-degree mask. The prototype was made in the plastic casework of a Viewmaster. The disc spins freely and is driven by a motor. The Vectrex software generates its own frame-rate and compares it to an index signal from the glasses once per revolution. Score is kept of how many wheel rotations are early compared to the software frame rate, and how many are late. The software tries to keep these two trends equal by adjusting the power being delivered to the motor that spins the filter and mask wheel. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is used to control the motor speed: the ratio of the "on" time versus the "off" time of a rapid stream of power pulses to the motor. In this way the software synchronizes the wheel rotation to the software's frame rate, or drawing time, for the combined and repeating group of up to 6 evolving images.
A single object that does not lie on the plane of the monitor (i.e., in front of or into the monitor) is drawn at least twice to provide information for each eye. The distance between the duplicate images and the angles from which they are drawn will determine where the object will appear to "be" in 3-D space. The 3-D illusion is also enhanced by adjusting the brightness of the object (dimming objects in the background). Spinning the disk at a high enough speed will fool the viewer's eyes/brain into thinking that the multiple images it is seeing are two different views of the same object due to the persistence of vision. This creates the impression of 3-D and color.
The same 3-D effect is in fact possible with raster or film-projection images, and the shutter glasses used in some 3-D theaters and virtual reality theme park rides work on the same principle.
The light pen allows the user to "draw", to create images and to indicate, on the screen. It has a photo-detector that can see the bright spot of the vector-drawing display monitor when it goes by under the light pen's position where it is being held to the screen. The photo-detector feeds internal pulse-catching circuits that tell the Vectrex and its software of the event. The prototype was made in the plastic casework of a Marks-A-Lot felt-tipped marker pen. The Vectrex draws a spider-web-like search-pattern to track the pen's location. The software changes the pattern size as the pen changes motions and velocity in an attempt keep a continuous lock on the pen's position. The Vectrex light pen was invented by John Ross.
Screen overlays
In order to enhance the display visuals of the Vectrex, every commercially released game included its own unique translucent plastic screen overlay that accompanied the cartridge (a concept first seen with the Magnavox Odyssey, as well as some early arcade machines). Instead of physically touching the CRT screen, four tabs on the Vectrex console securely held them in place in front of it, with a small gap between the actual screen and the overlay. Made up of one to three colors for the play field area, these overlays provide the illusion of simple color graphics (on an otherwise black and white screen), helped reduced glare, flicker and gave the appearance of a flat screen. They also allowed changes in brightness intensity of vector graphics to be more visually distinctive. In some cases game designers created pseudo color cycling effects, for a sense of movement, by using alternating colored patterns. In addition to players' score areas, some overlays also contained additional artwork and patterns, to add to the game's play field. Across the bottom of each overlay are game-specific joystick and button functions as a guide for the player. Each overlay also displayed the title and logo of each game, along with a colored border or design, to add cosmetic flair to the Vectrex (much like an arcade machine with its marquee or side art). Overlays were not required, but added to the experience in terms of the visual look of game graphics and the overall display appearance of the console.
Software
Some of the Vectrex's library consisted of ports of arcade hits, most of them brought to the console through a licensing deal with Cinematronics.
The liquor company Old Mr. Boston gave out a limited number of customized Clean Sweep cartridges, with a Mr. Boston sticker on the box. The overlay was the regular Clean Sweep overlay with the Mr. Boston name, logo, and copyright info running up either side. The game itself had custom text, and the player controlled a top hat rather than a vacuum. Clean Sweep was written by Richard Moszkowski.
Reception
Byte in 1982 called Vectrex "one of the greatest game machines we have seen this year ... [Vectrex] is a good bet to score big with the consumer". The magazine praised the screen, stating that "it almost has to be seen to be believed; imagine playing games at home (or in the office) using vector graphics with three-dimensional rotation and zoom", and noted that "It is unusual and refreshing to see a product appearing on the market with its software ready to run". David H. Ahl stated in Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games in 1983 that "Vector graphics really do make a difference, and the strong line-up of games helps immensely".
Legacy
Since late 1995, there has been a Usenet community of hobbyists writing games for ParaJVE, a Vectrex emulator. Its emulation is also a compound of MESS (included in MAME, so RetroArch too via libretro), DVE, lr-vex, Vecx, with a Wii version called VectrexWii. Schematics for a "Vectrex Multicart" cartridge is available, allowing several games to be packed on one cartridge. There are also several people manufacturing and selling newly made games, some complete as cartridges with packing and overlays in the style of the original commercially released games, others with varying degrees of packaging.

Taylor County is a county located in the west central portion of the U.S. state of Georgia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 8,906. The county seat and largest city is Butler.
History
Taylor County was created on January 15, 1852, by an act of the Georgia General Assembly from portions of Macon, Marion and Talbot counties. The County is named for Zachary Taylor, twelfth President of the United States.
Taylor County is also widely known for its history of racism and Jim Crow era subjugation of its African-American populace, which continued long into the 20th century. An especially egregious case is the 1946 lynching of Maceo Snipes, a World War II veteran and the first African-American to vote in Taylor County, for which they were murdered by the KKK on their doorstep in the hours following. Although not immediately succumbing to their wounds, Mr. Snipes death was eventually caused by the lack of availability of "black blood", or transfusions from a black person, at a Butler, Georgia hospital to which they were forced to walk three miles with gunshot wounds to their back. The murderers were never tried or otherwise held to account for their crimes, despite the involvement of the FBI. Mr. Snipes' murder was a motivating factor in Martin Luther King, Jr.'s first and only letter to the Atlanta Constitution at age 17, decrying the terrorism experienced by black citizens in the state at that time, which occurred largely at the hands of or with the blessing of the local and state authorities.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.8%) is water.
Taylor County is dissected by the Fall Line geological formation. The upper half of the county is located in the Piedmont region and consists of gently rolling hills and clay-based soils. The lower half of the county is located in the Upper Atlantic Coastal Plain and is markedly flatter and the soil more sandy. The Flint River marks the entirety of the county's northeastern border.
The county is driven by a largely agricultural economy. Peaches, strawberries, pecans, peanuts, watermelons, and cotton are the most commonly raised crops. Lumbering is also important to the local economy. The county is heavily forested in most areas due in part to the many large plantation pine farms. There are also many desirable hardwood forests, especially along the Flint River basin and tributary streams. The southwestern portion of the county is covered with large sandhills that have given rise to several stable sand mining operations.
The county supports a very healthy population of animals, including white-tailed deer, wild turkey, eastern cottontail, raccoon, coyote, bobcat, nine-banded armadillo, Virginia opossum, red-tailed hawk, and the federally endangered Florida gopher tortoise. Taylor County is home to five of North America's venomous snakes (eastern diamondback rattlesnake, timber rattlesnake, Carolina pygmy rattlesnake, eastern coral snake, water moccasin, and copperhead), representing every North American family of venomous snake.
The dominant tree species are southern red oak, post oak, longleaf pine, loblolly pine, sweetgum, and red maple. Taylor County contains the largest stands of the Atlantic white cedar in the state of Georgia. These stands can be found along much of Whitewater and Little Whitewater creeks and are at the heart of a growing movement to conserve these unique plant communities for posterity.
The vast majority of Taylor County is located in the Upper Flint River sub-basin of the ACF River Basin (Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin), with the exception of a tiny corner of the county just north of Georgia, which is located in the Middle Chattahoochee River-Walter F. George Lake sub-basin of the same ACF River Basin.

Brávellir (Old Norse) or Bråvalla (modern Swedish) () was the name of the central plain of Östergötland (East Götaland), in Norse mythology.
It appears in several traditions, such as those of the Battle of Bråvalla (Battle of the Bravellir), and in Helgakviða Hundingsbana I, where Sinfjötli resides on this plain. Stanza 42:
Its location has been contested because a local tradition places the Battle of Bråvalla at lake Åsnen in the Swedish province of Småland. In the oldest sources, however, such as the Hervarar saga it is described as (i.e. Bråvalla in Östergötland) and in Sögubrot af Nokkrum the battle is said to have taken place south of Kolmården which separated Sweden from Östergötland and where Bråviken is located:
In the legend of Blenda, the army of women assembled on the Brávellir.

Peter Cincotti (born July 11, 1983) is an American singer-songwriter. They began playing piano at the age of three. While in high school, they regularly performed in clubs throughout Manhattan. In 2003, Cincotti's debut album, produced by Phil Ramone, reached No. 1 on the Billboard jazz chart, making Cincotti the youngest musician to do so. This led to performances at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Radio City Music Hall, L'Olympia, Queen Elizabeth Hall, and the Montreux Jazz Festival where they won an award in the piano competition. Cincotti's style blends pop, rock, blues, and jazz.
Life and career
Cincotti was born in New York City. Their father is of Italian descent, from Cervinara, a small town in province of Avellino where they are an honorary citizen. Cincotti started playing a toy piano at the age of three. While in high school, they regularly performed at clubs throughout Manhattan and performed at the White House. They graduated from Columbia University in 2005. At the 2000 Montreux Jazz Festival, they won an award for a rendition of Dizzy Gillespie's A Night in Tunisia.
Their self-titled debut album is a compilation of traditional jazz songs, originals, and covers of classic songs ranging from the Rainbow Connection to Blood, Sweat and Tears's Spinning Wheel. Their second album, On the Moon, featured more of the artist's own songs as well and new arrangements of American standards. Combining elements of pop, jazz, funk and, rock, their third studio album, East of Angel Town, features all original works and was released in 2007 in Europe and in January 2009 in the United States. This project began when Cincotti joined record producer David Foster (who signed them to a contract with 143 Records), producer Humberto Gatica, and producer Jochem van der Saag. They toured around the world, promoting the album with their single "Goodbye Philadelphia" and later joined Seal on tour in the U.S. In 2008, they collaborated with French DJ David Guetta and they appeared on the finale of Star Academy, performing Love Is Gone. Combining pop, jazz, rock and dance, Cincotti created their fourth studio album, Metropolis, produced by John Fields and released worldwide in the spring of 2012. In 2016, Cincotti released the EP Exit 105, followed by Long Way from Home on Oct. 13 2017, Peter's fifth studio album which they wrote, arranged and produced.
In July 2012, they and their sister Pia Cincotti wrote and produced the musical How Deep Is the Ocean? with music and lyrics by Peter Cincotti and book by Pia Cincotti. It debuted at the New York Musical Theatre Festival. In 2013 they participated in the Festival of Sanremo, singing the song La Felicità (The Happiness) with Simona Molinari. Later that year, Cincotti was named the first male ambassador for Italian luxury designer Tods and collaborated with the brand on the music video "Madeline", which was featured in the Italian edition of Vanity Fair magazine. In 2014 Cincotti wrote, arranged, and produced the soundtrack for the Italian film Le Leggi Del Desiderio (Laws of Desire) directed by Silvio Muccino.
Cincotti appeared in a small role in the 2004 film Beyond the Sea about Bobby Darin and contributed to the film's soundtrack. They had a small role as the piano player in the Hayden Planetarium in Spider-Man 2. Their song December Boys is featured in the 2007 film December Boys starring Daniel Radcliffe. They appeared as themselves in Season 3 (2015) of the Netflix series House of Cards, singing a duet with President Francis Underwood (played by Kevin Spacey). In April 2015 they performed with Sting and Annie Lennox at The Old Vic Gala in a tribute to Spacey.
 They are a Dramatists Guild of America musical theater fellow and part of the Johnny Mercer Writing Colony at Goodspeed Musicals.
In 2017, they released the music video for their single, "Made for Me" which was debuted by People Magazine.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, Peter wrote and produced a song for New York called ‘Heart Of The City', which was featured in Katie Couric's ‘Get Inspired' newsletter and TV shows such as Good Day New York.
In late 2020 and early 2021, Peter began work on their highly anticipated upcoming album '88 Keys and Me', which will honor some of the most influential piano men and women of all time, featuring songs by artists ranging from Scott Joplin to Lady Gaga.

Russell Edward Dickerson was born May 7, 1987 in Union City, Tennessee.

Dickerson also joined Billy Currington on the road in 2016.
In 2015, they released the single "Yours" written by Dickerson, Parker Welling, and Casey Brown. It became the title track to their second extended play, released on January 18, 2016, by Dent Records. The EP debuted at number 14 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, selling 2,700 copies in its first week of release. It launched at number 2 in the iTunes Country Store and number 8 in all genres. On October 10, 2016, they signed with Triple Tigers Records which assumed distribution of the single.

The following lists events that happened during 1922 in Afghanistan.
The amir personally sets a high standard of devotion to duty, which is followed by their civil service. They encourage the sending of Afghan youths abroad to be educated. During the year a number of telegraph and telephone lines are laid down or commenced, e.g., from Landi Khana to Kabul, and from Kabul to Peshawar; while young Afghans are trained for telegraph work at Karachi.
Incumbents
Monarch – Amanullah Khan
February 1922
An Afghan mission arrives in Angora with an autograph letter from the amir expressing the warmest sentiments towards the Turkish government, and stating that they urged the British government to abstain from assisting the Greeks. Towards Russia Afghan sentiment is at first rather unfriendly.
Beginning of March 1922
Maj. Francis Humphrys reaches Kabul as British minister. At about the same time Sardar Abdul Hadi Khan arrives in London as Afghan minister to the Court of St. James. This interchange of ambassadors sets the seal upon the new relationship between the two countries. In an interview to The Times Hadi Khan says they think the treaty will strengthen trade relations between Afghanistan and India; they also say that their people are beginning to be better disposed towards England.
Early summer 1922
Many of the large number of refugees from Turkestan who are hostile to the Soviet government rally to the flag of Enver Pasha when on behalf of the Bokhara government they make war on Russia. But the successes of the Russian arms soon cause a marked change of sentiment in Afghanistan. On June 17 there appears in the Ittihad-i-Mashriqi of Jalalabad an obviously inspired article strongly disapproving of the anti-Bolshevik insurrection in Turkestan and advocating relations of disinterested friendship all round. This policy is energetically pursued by Mohammad Wali Khan, who in July, on their return from their world diplomatic mission, becomes foreign minister in succession to Sardar Mahmud Beg Tarzi. On August 15 they issue a statement that they regard the disturbances in Bokhara as a purely internal affair, the Russo-Afghan treaty of last year having agreed to recognize the independence of Bokhara and Khiva.
August 16–25, 1922
Festivities are held at Paghman to celebrate the anniversary of Afghan independence. The amir on this occasion becomes reconciled with their elder brother, Inayatullah Khan. A rumour spread that they had been murdered, and they had to hasten to Kabul to show himself. They take the opportunity of making a speech in which they lay stress on the importance of developing home industries, of dispensing with foreign officials, and of a strong army to preserve the national independence. Subject to these conditions the amir shows themselves anxious to modernize the country. They welcome the presence of all kinds of foreign missions. Thus on October 13 Raymond Poincaré demands from the French chamber credits for the creation of a French legation in Afghanistan, the two governments having agreed to receive permanent diplomatic missions.
October 1922
During the Near Eastern crisis Afghanistan remains outwardly calm, but that it has been profoundly impressed by the success of Turkey is shown a couple of months later when the Times of India publish the terms of a new treaty between Afghanistan and Angora. In this document Afghanistan acknowledges Turkey as its "suzerain," i.e., as heir to the privileges of the caliphate, and recognizes the independence of Bokhara and Khiva. The chief object of the treaty is to institute a defensive alliance between the two countries, commercial and financial arrangements being left to a separate protocol. Turkey also undertakes to send teachers and military officers to remain in Afghanistan for a period of five years.
Early November 1922
The British commercial mission is in Kabul to arrange details of a trade convention on the lines laid down in the Anglo-Afghan treaty.

"Tuman", meaning "fog" in Russian, is a song by the Russian band Kommunizm. It was released in 1990.
History
The song was written by Alexander Kolker in 1967 for the soundtrack to the film Chronicles of a Dive Bomber.
In 1989, the Russian poet Egor Letov recorded a version for their band Kommunizm's album Khronika pikiruyushchego bombardirovshchika. It appears twice on the album: once as track 1, and the second time as track 17, as an instrumental titled "Chronicles of a Dive Bomber". Before the 2011 LP reissue of Chronicles of a Dive Bomber, the title track faded out at the 1:53 mark, but it was restored to its natural length on the LP, revealing some previously-hidden vocals. It was faded out again on the 2014 version, however this time, ten seconds of silence were placed at the end
From 1991 to 1992, when Egor i Opizdenevshie's second album Sto let odinochestva was being recorded, Letov listened to "Tuman" and thought the recording from KPB was good enough to include on the album, so it was put on.
Letov has frequently played "Tuman" live at their solo acoustic concerts. One such recording appears as a bonus track on the 2010 CD reissue of the Grazhdanskaya Oborona album Zvezdopad (2002). The rendition appearing on the reissue was recorded live in Barnaul on 14 December 2003. It was also included on the 2011 vinyl reissue of the 2010 reissue.
On the recorded version appearing on Chronicles of a Dive Bomber and Sto let odinochestva, Kuzya Waugh can be heard shouting "Blyad" in reverse at the beginning and says something else at the end. According to Letov, it was because Waugh was taping and told Letov, who was the drummer in the session, to start and stop. Waugh was in the GrOb studio control room while Letov was in the recording space.
The 1989 recording also appears on the 1990 Kommunizm compilation "Trinadtsat", in a backmasked version called "Manut" and in the instrumental version as "Vozdushnye rabochnie voiny".

Escape in the Fog is a 1945 American film noir crime film directed by Budd Boetticher (as Oscar Boetticher Jr.) and starring Otto Kruger, Nina Foch and William Wright.
Boetticher called it a "nothing" picture, though they enjoyed working with Nina Foch and Otto Kruger.
Plot
During World War II, a San Francisco nurse dreams of a murder and then meets the "victim" in real life. What they saw in the dream helps them in an effort to thwart enemy spies.

Nina Foch as Eileen Carr
William Wright as Barry Malcolm

Reception
Film critic Jeremy Arnold gave the film a mixed review, writing "Although Wright and Foch have the most screen time, top billing goes to Otto Kruger, the immensely enjoyable character actor who specialized in charming, urbane villains. He's fine as always here but doesn't get much to do. William Wright was an unremarkable actor who appeared almost entirely in B movies in a 45-film career that spanned the 1940s."

Song Yongyi (Chinese: 宋永毅; born 15 December 1949) is a Chinese American historian who specializes in the study of Chinese Cultural Revolution. They currently work at the California State University, Los Angeles, and previously served as a college librarian at the Dickinson College in Pennsylvania.
Biography
Song Yongyi was born in Shanghai, China in December 1949. During the Cultural Revolution, Song became a Red Guard who followed Mao Zedong, but was jailed when they were 17 for several years because they were part of the "counter-revolutionary clique" that challenged Zhang Chunqiao.
After the Cultural Revolution, they were accepted into the Shanghai Normal University in 1977, when the National College Entrance Examination was resumed by Deng Xiaoping. They came to the United States in 1989 and obtained a Master of Arts from the University of Colorado Boulder in 1992, and was awarded another master's degree at the Indiana University Bloomington in 1995.
In the summer of 1999, Song went back to China to collect documents related to the Cultural Revolution, but was arrested by the Chinese government for "stealing state secrets". More than 100 scholars and researchers called for their release. United States senators Arlen Specter and Matt Salmon intervened in the case and negotiated with Jiang Zemin, then General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese President. Song was finally released from prison after more than 100 days.

USS Migrant (IX‑66) was a schooner of the United States Navy during World War II.
The ship was built in 1929 by George Lawley & Sons, Neponset, Massachusetts, and acquired from Carl Tucker by the Port Director, New York, for the US Navy on 21 March 1942, converted by the Sullivan Shipyard, Brooklyn, New York, and commissioned on 19 May 1942.
Service history
Acquired originally for use in the 3rd Naval District, Migrant was assigned to the Eastern Sea Frontier following their conversion and commissioning. Until the spring of 1944 they conducted anti-submarine patrols from New York, along the southern New England coast. Transferred on 30 April 1944 to the 1st Naval District at Boston, they conducted ASW patrols along the northern New England coast for the remainder of their Navy career.
Migrant, ordered inactivated in June 1945, was decommissioned at East Boston on 3 August. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register ten days later, they remained at East Boston until 6 January 1946 when they were turned over to the War Shipping Administration for disposal.

Execution in computer and software engineering is the process by which a computer or virtual machine reads and acts on the instructions of a computer program. Each instruction of a program is a description of a particular action which must be carried out, in order for a specific problem to be solved. Execution involves repeatedly following a 'fetch–decode–execute' cycle for each instruction done by control unit. As the executing machine follows the instructions, specific effects are produced in accordance with the semantics of those instructions.
Programs for a computer may be executed in a batch process without human interaction or a user may type commands in an interactive session of an interpreter. In this case, the "commands" are simply program instructions, whose execution is chained together.
The term run is used almost synonymously. A related meaning of both "to run" and "to execute" refers to the specific action of a user starting (or launching or invoking) a program, as in "Please run the application."
Process
Prior to execution, a program must first be written. This is generally done in source code, which is then compiled at compile time (and statically linked at link time) to produce an executable. This executable is then invoked, most often by an operating system, which loads the program into memory (load time), possibly performs dynamic linking, and then begins execution by moving control to the entry point of the program; all these steps depend on the Application Binary Interface of the operating system. At this point execution begins and the program enters run time. The program then runs until it ends, either normal termination or a crash.
Executable
Executable code, an executable file, or an executable program, sometimes simply referred to as an executable or
binary, is a list of instructions and data to cause a computer "to perform indicated tasks according to encoded instructions", as opposed to a data file that must be interpreted (parsed) by a program to be meaningful.
The exact interpretation depends upon the use. "Instructions" is traditionally taken to mean machine code instructions for a physical CPU. In some contexts, a file containing scripting instructions (such as bytecode) may also be considered executable.
Context of execution
The context in which execution takes place is crucial. Very few programs execute on a bare machine. Programs usually contain implicit and explicit assumptions about resources available at the time of execution. Most programs execute within multitasking operating system and run-time libraries specific to the source language that provide crucial services not supplied directly by the computer itself. This supportive environment, for instance, usually decouples a program from direct manipulation of the computer peripherals, providing more general, abstract services instead.
Context switching
In order for programs and interrupt handlers to work without interference and share the same hardware memory and access to the I/O system, in a multitasking operating systems running on a digital system with a single CPU/MCU it is required to have some sort of software and hardware facilities to keep track of an executing processes data (memory page addesses, registers etc.) and to save and recover them back to the state they were in before they were suspended. This is achieved by a context switching. The running programs are often assigned a Process Context IDentifiers (PCID).
In Linux-based operating systems, a set of data stored in registers is usually saved into a process descriptor in memory to implement switching of context. PCIDs are also used.
Runtime system
A runtime system, also called runtime environment, primarily implements portions of an execution model. This is not to be confused with the runtime lifecycle phase of a program, during which the runtime system is in operation. When treating the runtime system as distinct from the runtime environment (RTE), the first may be defined as a specific part of the application software (IDE) used for programming, a piece of software that provides the programmer a more convenient environment for running programs during their production (testing and similar), while the second (RTE) would be the very instance of an execution model being applied to the developed program which is itself then run in the asupervisorstioned runtime system.
Most programming languages have some form of runtime system that provides an environment in which programs run. This environment may address a number of issues including the management of application memory, how the program accesses variables, mechanisms for passing parameters between procedures, interfacing with the operating system, and otherwise. The compiler makes assumptions depending on the specific runtime system to generate correct code. Typically the runtime system will have some responsibility for setting up and managing the stack and heap, and may include features such as garbage collection, threads or other dynamic features built into the language.
Instruction cycle
The instruction cycle (also known as the fetch–decode–execute cycle, or simply the fetch-execute cycle) is the cycle that the central processing unit (CPU) follows from boot-up until the computer has shut down in order to process instructions. It is composed of three main stages: the fetch stage, to decode stage, and the execute stage.
In simpler CPUs, the instruction cycle is executed sequentially, each instruction being processed before the next one is started. In most modern CPUs, the instruction cycles are instead executed concurrently, and often in parallel, through an instruction pipeline: the next instruction starts being processed before the previous instruction has finished, which is possible because the cycle is broken up into separate steps.
Interpreter
A system that executes a program is called an interpreter of the program. Loosely speaking, an interpreter directly executes a program. This contrasts with a language translator that converts a program from one language to another before it is executed.
Virtual machine
A virtual machine (VM) is the virtualization/emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.
Virtual machines differ and are organized by their function, shown here:
System virtual machines (also termed full virtualization VMs) provide a substitute for a real machine. They provide functionality needed to execute entire operating systems. A hypervisor uses native execution to share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments which are isolated from one another, yet exist on the same physical machine. Modern hypervisors use hardware-assisted virtualization, virtualization-specific hardware, primarily from the host CPUs.
Process virtual machines are designed to execute computer programs in a platform-independent environment.
Some virtual machine emulators, such as QEMU and video game console emulators, are designed to also emulate (or "virtually imitate") different system architectures thus allowing execution of software applications and operating systems written for another CPU or architecture. Operating-system-level virtualization allows the resources of a computer to be partitioned via the kernel. The terms are not universally interchangeable.

The Kiss is a 1929 American silent drama film directed by Jacques Feyder, starring Greta Garbo, Conrad Nagel, and Lew Ayres in their first feature film. Based on a short story by George M. Saville, The Kiss bears the same title as the 1896 short that "shocked" the American public by being the first motion picture to depict a couple kissing. This 1929 production is notable for being the last major silent film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and the final silent performances by both Garbo and Conrad Nagel. Although this film is not entirely silent, MGM did take partial advantage of the new sound technology and released The Kiss with an orchestral score and sound effects recorded by the Movietone system.
Plot
The story is set in 1929 and begins inside the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon, France. Two lovers — Irene Guarry (Greta Garbo) and André Dubail (Conrad Nagel) — feign interest in artwork as they discuss their clandestine romance. Irene is a young woman unhappily married to Charles Guarry (Anders Randolf), a wealthy, much older business person, whose company teeters near bankruptcy. André is a successful lawyer, unmarried, close to Irene's age, and determined to face Charles and profess their love for Irene. Despite being trapped in a loveless marriage, Irene fears their husband's violent temper and their reaction if André were to confront him. "He's madly jealous," they tell André, and insists that their marriage situation is hopelessly bound by "convention...to a man I don't love." After they and André kiss, they leave the museum, determined never to see their true love again.
Back home, Irene's suspicious husband reviews their daily activities through a private investigator they hired to follow them The investigator only reports that they went to a local dog show and had an innocent encounter with Pierre Lassalle (Lew Ayres), the 18-year-old son of one of Charles' business associates. Later, Irene and Charles attend a large formal dinner party.  They are surprised to see André, who arrives alone and sits at the dinner table across from Irene's sullen husband. Young Pierre is at the party too, and their father informs Irene that their college-bound boy is "quite mad" about them André and Irene do manage to meet briefly in a nearby garden, where André tells them they are moving to Paris and came to the party to see them one last time. They again express their love, kiss passionately and part, both resolved that their affair has ended. Irene then returns to the party to dance with lovestruck Pierre.
The following day, after a tennis match at their parents' estate, Pierre confesses their love to Irene while Charles meets with Pierre's father to discuss their failing business and need for money. Irene is touched by Pierre's confession but makes light of their ardor, referring to them as "only a young boy." They agree, however, to give them a photograph of themselves that they can take to college. The following evening, Pierre visits Irene's home to get the promised photo, and as they leaf they request a small goodbye kiss. Irene hesitates but gives them a short kiss, which incites Pierre to grab them and press for a more intense one. Returning home, Charles sees their follow-up kiss, storms into the room, and begins to beat Pierre mercilessly. As their husband pursues the college boy into another room, Irene pleads with them to stop their assault, but they continue to batter Pierre. The room's door closes; a muffled gunshot is heard. Charles dies.
Irene killed their husband to save Pierre, but before authorities are summoned, they alter the scene and timeline of the crime. To protect Pierre's reputation and herself, they tell the police their depressed husband committed suicide due to their dire finances. Investigators doubt their story and Irene is indicted for murder, prompting André to return to Lyon to defend their ex-lover. During the trial they repeatedly assure André that their husband killed himself. Courtroom testimony by Pierre's father about Charles' impending bankruptcy and "utter despair," along with André's heartfelt declarations of Irene's innocence, convince the jury to acquit them In the court area after the verdict, a smug Pierre tells Irene that their love for them compelled them to kill Charles, but they quickly realize that André is their true love. Guilt-ridden for lying to André, Irene divulges the truth to him. Stunned, they sit and cradles their head in their hands, quietly reassessing their feelings. Believing they have destroyed their relationship with André, Irene is relieved when they finally stand and reaffirms their love for them The film ends with them kissing just as three old cleaning women enter the room and announce they "have come to clean the court."

Production notes
During casting for The Kiss, Garbo recommended Nils Asther for the role as their lover André. Asther had been born in Denmark but, like Garbo, had grown up in Sweden, an association with the actor that only enhanced their reputation as "the male Greta Garbo" in the film industry and among movie fans. In addition, they had already costarred with them in two of MGM's recent film successes and was still under contract with the studio. Nevertheless, despite those apparent advantages held by Asther and Garbo's strong support for them to join the cast, the part was assigned to Conrad Nagel.
By early September 1929, The Kiss was already being filmed at MGM, although the studio had yet to announce publicly a title for the production. According to the trade paper The Film Daily, a dozen feature films were simultaneously under way at that time at MGM. All but one were "talkers". "The only silent picture being filmed", reported The Film Daily, "is Greta Garbo's new untitled European romance now being directed by Jacques Feyder".
The visually striking Art Déco interior sets in The Kiss were designed by legendary MGM art director and production designer Cedric Gibbons. Gibbons' bold, high-fashion sets in the film were intended to emphasize the French style and serve as "vital elements" in the production, especially in a silent offering like The Kiss, which had to compete at its release with many other motion pictures that featured the new "exciting" element of recorded dialog.
Reception
Most film critics gave very positive reviews of The Kiss in 1929, a year in which American motion pictures were continuing their transition from the last major silent productions to the release of more sound films. Variety alluded to that transition in its 1929 review of The Kiss, contending that the film would have likely suffered in quality if it had been released with recorded dialog.
The film grossed $518,000 in the United States and $387,000 elsewhere, bringing its worldwide gross to $905,000, the profit for the film was $448,000.
The publication felt that both Garbo's performance and their physical appearance in the film were actually enhanced by its silent format:
Film critic Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times referred to the presence of The Kiss among all the new talking pictures in late 1929 as "Golden silence" and a demonstration of Fedyer's "consummate artistry" with a non-talker. "Miss Garbo", observed Hall, "once again reveals their extraordinary talent for screen acting, and under M. Fedyer's guidance they are if anything more impressive than they have been in other films." The Film Daily—widely read by studio personnel and theater owners—also described Garbo as "very alluring" and "exotic" in The Kiss; but that paper found the "sophisticated drama" lacking, especially the film's conclusion. "The subject matter", wrote The Film Daily, "is too tragic, and the ending not the type that the average fan looks for."
Released less than 4 months after the disastrous "crash" of the American stock market in 1929, The Kiss was not expected to do well financially by attracting sizeable crowds of filmgoers in that highly unstable economic time. The film, though, surprised studio executives by making a significant profit and becoming Garbo's second most successful silent picture, ranking only behind Flesh and the Devil with John Gilbert, which had been released three years earlier. In Atlanta, Georgia, for example, it was reported that during Thanksgiving week The Kiss "broke all existing house records for receipts at Loew's Capitol [Theatre]".
Seven decades after its initial release, The Kiss has been recognized as one of the notable portrayals of romance in cinematic history. In 2002, the American Film Institute placed the MGM classic on its list of 400 nominations in its "100 Years/100 Passions" poll to determine "America's Greatest Love Stories". The movie enthusiasts or "jurors" who voted in that 2002 poll did not include The Kiss and various other silent productions in their final selection of 100 films. In fact, only four non-talkers—Way Down East (1920), Rudolph Valentino's The Sheik (1921), Sunrise (1927), and Charlie Chaplin's City Lights (1931)—were chosen for AFI's top-100 "Greatest Love Stories" list.

Volapük ( in English; in Volapük; "Language of the World", or lit. "World Speak") is a constructed language created between 1879 and 1880 by Johann Martin Schleyer, a Catholic priest in Baden, Germany, who believed that God had told them in a dream to create an international language. Notable as the first major constructed international auxiliary language, the grammar comes from European languages and the vocabulary mostly from English (with some German and French). However, the roots are often distorted beyond recognition.
Volapük conventions took place in 1884 (Friedrichshafen), 1887 (Munich) and 1889 (Paris). The first two conventions used German, and the last conference used only Volapük. By 1889, there were an estimated 283 clubs, 25 periodicals in or about Volapük, and 316 textbooks in 25 languages; at that time the language claimed nearly a million adherents. However, Volapük was largely displaced between the late 19th and early 20th century by Esperanto.
History
Schleyer first published a sketch of Volapük in May 1879 in Sionsharfe, a Catholic poetry magazine of which they were editor. This was followed in 1880 by a full-length book in German. Schleyer themselves did not write books on Volapük in other languages, but other authors soon did.
André Cherpillod writes of the third Volapük convention,
The Dutch cryptographer Auguste Kerckhoffs was for a number of years Director of the Academy of Volapük, and introduced the movement to several countries.
The French Association for the Propagation of Volapük was authorized on 8 April 1886, with A. Lourdelet as president and a central committee that included the deputy Edgar Raoul-Duval.
However, tensions arose between Kerckhoffs and others in the Academy, who wanted reforms made to the language, and Schleyer, who insisted strongly on retaining their proprietary rights. This led to schism, with much of the Academy abandoning Schleyer's Volapük in favor of Idiom Neutral and other new constructed language projects. Another reason for the decline of Volapük may have been the rise of Esperanto. In 1887 the first Esperanto book (Unua Libro) was published. Many Volapük clubs became Esperanto clubs.
By 1890 the movement was in disarray, with violent arguments among the members. Schleyer resigned from the Volapük Academy and created a rival academy. Derived languages such as Nal Bino, Balta, Bopal, Spelin, Dil and Orba were invented and quickly forgotten.
In the 1920s, Arie de Jong, with the consent of the leaders of the small remnant of Volapük speakers, made a revision of Volapük which was published in 1931 (now called Volapük Nulik "New Volapük" as opposed to the Volapük Rigik 'Original Volapük' of Schleyer). This revision was accepted by the few speakers of the language. De Jong simplified the grammar, eliminating some rarely used verb forms, and eliminated some gendered pronouns and gendered verb endings. They also rehabilitated the phoneme and used it to make some morphemes more recognizable. For instance, lömib "rain" became rein.
Volapük enjoyed a brief renewal of popularity in the Netherlands and Germany under de Jong's leadership, but was suppressed (along with other constructed languages) in countries under Nazi rule and never recovered.
Regarding the success of this artificial language, the Spanish scientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal wrote in the first edition of their Tonics of Willingness, in 1898:
However, some years later (1920), in the third edition of the same book, they added the following footnote to the former assertion: "As it was presumable, nowadays -1920-, the brand-new Volapük has been forgotten definitively. We forecast the same for Esperanto."
Large Volapük collections are held by the International Esperanto Museum in Vienna, Austria; the Center for Documentation and Study about the International Language in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland; and the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
In 2000 there were an estimated 20 Volapük speakers in the world.
In December 2007 it was reported that the Volapük version of Wikipedia had recently jumped to 15th place among language editions, with more than 112,000 articles.
A few months earlier there had been only 797 articles. The massive increase in the size of "Vükiped", bringing it ahead of the Esperanto Wikipedia, was due to an enthusiast who had used a computer program to automatically create geographical articles, many on small villages. The motive was to gain visibility for the language.
By March 2013 the Esperanto Wikipedia, with a very active user community, had risen to 176,792 articles, while the Volapük Wikipedia had at that point 119,091 articles.
There has been a continuous Volapük speaker community since Schleyer's time, with an unbroken succession of Cifals (leaders). These were:
Johann Martin Schleyer 1879–1912
Albert Sleumer 1912–1948
Arie de Jong (provisionally) 1947–1948, 1951–1957
Jakob Sprenger 1948–1950
Johann Schmidt 1950–1977
Johann Krüger 1977–1983
Brian Bishop 1984–2014
Hermann Philipps 2014–present
Orthography and pronunciation
The alphabet is as follows:
That is, the vowel letters ä, ö, ü have the pronunciations they do in German, roughly like English end, fern, über. C is pronounced like English j or ch, and j like English sh, or like the s in English "usually". is pronounced after voiced consonants, for example bs, ds, gs, ls, as plural -s is in English. R was not found in the original proposal.
The letters ä, ö, and ü do not have alternative forms such as the ae, oe, and ue of German, but Schleyer proposed alternate forms ꞛ, ꞝ, and ꞟ for them, all of which are part of Unicode since version 7.0 released in June 2014:
There are no diphthongs; each vowel letter is pronounced separately.
Special consonantal letters
The author Alfred A. Post mentions in their Comprehensive Volapük Grammar some additional letters created by Schleyer:
And the following letters are constructed by the inventor to designate sounds which occasionally occur –
Most of these letters can already be found in Unicode:
()
()
(for composing m̂ and n̂)
()
Letter r
Some phonemes, such as ö and ü , were not avoided, despite being uncommon.
Schleyer's 1880 Volapük as well as Modern Volapük has minimal l–r pairs such as rel "religion" versus lel "iron".
Syllabic stress
Polysyllabic words are always stressed on the final vowel; for example, neai "never" is pronounced . (However, the question clitic "-li" does not affect the stress of the word it attaches to.) Where there is secondary stress, as is found in the compounding of several roots together, it is found on the final syllable between the roots.
Vocabulary
Schleyer adapted the vocabulary mostly from English, with a smattering of German and French. Some words remain readily recognizable for a speaker of one of the source languages, but many others are modified beyond easy recognition. For instance, vol and pük are derived from the English words world and speak. Although unimportant linguistically, and regardless of the simplicity and consistency of the stress rule, these deformations were greatly mocked by the language's detractors. It seems to have been Schleyer's intention, however, to alter its loan words in such a way that they would be hard to recognise, thus losing their ties to the languages (and, by extension, nations) from which they came. Conversely, Esperanto and Interlingua are commonly criticized as being much easier to learn for Europeans than for those with non-European native languages.
Grammar
The grammar is based on that of typical European languages, but with an agglutinative character: grammatical inflections are indicated by stringing together separate affixes for each element of meaning.
Nouns
Nouns inflect for case and number, but not for gender.
The following is the declension of the Volapük word vol "world":
As in German, the Volapük noun has four cases: nominative, genitive, dative and accusative. In compound words, the first part of the compound is usually separated from the second by the genitive termination -a, e.g. Vola-pük, "of-world language": "language of the world". However, the other case endings (-e dative, -i accusative) are sometimes used if applicable, or the roots may be agglutinated in the nominative, with no separating vowel.
Adjectives and adverbs
Adjectives, formed by the suffix -ik, normally follow the noun they qualify. They do not agree with the noun in number and case in that position, but do if they precede the noun, are separated from it by intervening words, or stand alone. Adverbs are formed by suffixing -o, either to the root or to the adjectival -ik (gudik "good", gudiko "well"); they normally follow the verb or adjective they modify.
Pronouns
The pronouns begin with o-. In the singular, they are ob "I", ol "thou", om "he/it", of "she", os (impersonal), on "one", ok "oneself". They are pluralized with -s: obs "we", ols "ye", oms "they". The possessive may be formed with either the genitive -a or with adjectival -ik: oba or obik "my". Prepositions, conjunctions and interjections are also formed from noun roots by appending appropriate suffixes. In later, reformed Volapük, om was narrowed down to males only, whereas on got the meaning of 'it' as well as impersonal 'they'.
Verbs
The verb carries a fine degree of detail, with morphemes marking tense, aspect, voice, person, number and (in the third person) the subject's gender. However, many of these categories are optional, and a verb can stand in an unmarked state. A Volapük verb can be conjugated in 1,584 ways (including infinitives and reflexives).
Person
For the simple present, the pronouns are suffixed to the verb stem:
binob I am, binol thou art,
etc. The present passive takes the prefix pa-:
palöfons they are loved.
Tense, aspect, and voice
The three tenses in the indicative, and the three perfect aspects, each take a characteristic vowel prefix:
The present-tense prefix is omitted in the active voice, so:
binob I am, äbinol you were, ebinom they have been, ibinof they had been, obinos it will be, ubinon one will have been.
These are seen as being more distant from the present tense the further the vowel is from in vowel space, and they can be used with temporal words to indicate distance in the past or future. For example, from del 'day',
adelo today, odelo tomorrow, udelo the day after tomorrow, ädelo yesterday, edelo the day before yesterday, idelo three days ago.
The passive voice is formed with p-, and here the is required for the present tense:
palöfob I am loved, pälogol you were seen, pologobs we will be seen.
Infinitive mood
The infinitive is formed with the suffix -ön. It can be combined with tense/aspect prefixes:
Logön to see, elogön to have seen.
Interrogative mood
Yes–no questions are indicated with the particle li:
Pälogom-li was they seen?
The hyphen indicates that the syllable li does not take stress. It occurs before the verb to avoid a sequence of three consonants or a double el: li-pälogol? li-binoms?
Participles and the habitual aspect
Participles, both active and passive, are formed in -öl:
Logöl seeing, elogöl having seen, ologöl being about to see, palogöl seen (being seen), pelogöl seen (having been seen), pologöl about to be seen.
Binob penöl is literally 'I am writing', though penob is also used. For "I write" as habitual action, the habitual aspect is used. This is formed by adding -i- after the tense prefix, and here again the present-tense a- is required. The forms are thus active ai-, äi-, ei-, ii-, oi-, ui-, passive pai-, päi-, pei-, pii-, poi-, pui-. All are pronounced as two syllables.
Aifidob bodi I eat bread (as a daily occurrence), äipenob penedis I used to write letters.
With temporal words,
aidelo daily (at the present time)
The imperative moods
The imperative -öd follows the person suffix:
Gololöd! Go! (to one person), gololsöd! go! (to more than one person)
Optative -ös is used for courteous requests, and jussive -öz an emphatic command.
Conditional mood
Conditionals are formed with -la for the protasis (if-clause) and -öv for the apodosis (then-clause):
If äbinob-la liegik, äbinoböv givik – if I were rich I would be generous.
Ibinomöv givik, if ibinom-la liegik – they had been generous if they had been rich.
Note that the tense changes as well, so that in the first example the past tense is used even though the present tense is intended. Like the question particle, the -la is written with a hyphen to indicate that it is not stressed in speech.
Potential mood
A potential mood is formed with -öx:
Pelomöx they might pay.
Reflexive verbs
Reflexive forms are made from the active voice and the pronoun ok:
Vatükob I wash, vatükobok (or vatükob obi) I wash myself.
In the third person, the periphrastic form of vatükomok (he washes himself) must use the reflexive pronoun, vatükom oki, as vatükom omi would mean "he washes them (someone else)".
The plural -s may precede or follow the reflexive, as the speaker chooses:
vatükomoks or vatükomsok they wash themselves.
Here there is a meaningful distinction between joining the pronoun to the verb, and inflecting it independently:
Löfobsok we love ourselves, löfobs obis we love each other.
Gerundive
The gerundive arguments are active ö-, passive pö-.
Examples
The Lord's Prayer
Usage as common noun
The word Volapük or a variation thereof means "nonsense, gibberish" in certain languages, such as Danish volapyk and Esperanto volapukaĵo. In Russian, the term Volapuk encoding refers to writing Cyrillic letters with the Latin alphabet based on what they look like, for example writing instead of волапюк.

The Mérida tapaculo (Scytalopus meridanus) is a species of bird in the family Rhinocryptidae. It is endemic to Venezuela.
Taxonomy and systematics
The Mérida tapaculo was previously considered a subspecies of brown-rumped tapaculo (Scytalopus latebricola) but was elevated to species rank based on differences in their vocalizations. Two subspecies are currently (2021) recognized, the nominate S. meridanus meridanus and the "Lara" S. m. fuscicauda. The latter was at one time classed as a subspecies of Magellanic tapaculo (S. magellanicus) and has also been considered a separate species, "Lara tapaculo". It might even be conspecific with S. a. meridanus and not a subspecies.
Description
The Mérida tapaculo is long and weighs . The male's upper body is dark gray washed with brown; the rump and wings are brown. The throat, breast, and belly are paler gray and the flanks and crissum (the area around the cloaca) tawny with faint darker bars. The female is generally paler but the brown wash of the upper body is darker and the tawny flanks brighter. The juvenile is overall brown, darker above and lighter below, with barred underparts. The adult "Lara" subspecies has minor plumage differences from the nominate but they are thought to be age related.
Distribution and habitat
The Mérida tapaculo is found only in the Andes of Venezuela. The nominate subspecies is more southerly, in Mérida and Táchira States, while the "Lara" subspecies is north of it in Lara and Trujillo States. It inhabits the undergrowth and edges of humid montane forest. It is found in Chusquea bamboo but does not prefer it. The nominate subspecies is found mostly from elevation while the "Lara" subspecies is found lower, from .
Behavior
Feeding
The Mérida tapaculo's diet and foraging phenology have not been studied.
Breeding
Little is known about the Mérida tapaculo's breeding phenology. Two nests of the "Lara" subspecies were globes made of moss, rootlets, and leaves. They were in crevices in a rock wall; one had one egg and the other two eggs. At both nests, both adults incubated the eggs until they were predated.
Vocalization
The Mérida tapaculo's song starts with a few descending notes and becomes a rising trill . It has several calls such as , , and .
Status
The IUCN has assessed the Mérida tapaculo as being of The Least Concern. Though its range is rather small and its population number is not known, it appears to be common with a stable population. Both subspecies occur in several protected areas.

Paul Marie Félix Jacques René Arnaud de Foïard (9 September 1921 – 7 August 2005) was a général of the French Army who served primarily in the French Foreign Legion taking part in World War II and the conflicts of Indochina and Algeria.
Military career
Paul Arnaud de Foïard commenced their arms in the resistance where they were captured and interned on 4 December 1942 until 3 June 1943. Escaped, they disembarked in Spain where they were interned at Figueras. They were liberated at Setubal in Portugal, and embarked to Morocco on 21 August.
During this time, they registered an engagement for the duration of the war by joining the 501e Régiment de chars de combat 501e RCC. Their services counted as retroactive, counting from 4 December 1942. They passed to the instruction depot of Dellys, then joined the school of Cherchell as an aspirant. They were assigned to the Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion RMLE with the rank of aspirant on 1 April 1944. With their unit, they participated to the disembarking at Saint-Raphaël in September then to the offensive of the Ist Army, an offensive during which they were wounded by a mine. They were evacuated on 28 November 1944 and cited at the orders of the brigade with their first croix de guerre 1939–1945.

Dave's Picks Volume 21 is a three-CD live album by the rock group the Grateful Dead. It contains the complete concert recorded on April 2, 1973, at Boston Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. It was produced as a limited edition of 16,500 copies, and was released on February 1, 2017.
Critical reception
On AllMusic, Timothy Monger said, "The last show of their winter/spring tour, Vol. 21 finds the Dead stretching out over two very long sets which, in spite of their length, do not contain either of their major gig-stretchers of the era. In place of "Dark Star" or "The Other One", fans were treated to a whopping 34-song marathon... Several nice long jams can be found, particularly in the second set, making for a diverse and engaging listen."

Maurice Janet (1888–1983) was a French mathematician.
Education and career
In 1912 as a student they visited the University of Göttingen. They were a professor at the University of Caen. They were an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1924 in Toronto, in 1932 in Zürich, and in 1936 in Oslo.
Named in their honor are Janet bases, Janet sequences and a related algorithm in the theory of systems of partial differential equations. In 1926 they proved results that were later generalized by John Forbes Nash Jr. in their embedding theorem.
In 1948 Janet was the president of the Société Mathématique de France. They were a close friend of the mathematician Ernest Vessiot.

The Battle of Compton's Ferry, also known as Little Compton Ferry, was an action during the American Civil War, occurring along the Grand River in southwest Livingston County, Missouri. The battle lasted from August 10 to August 13, 1862.
Battle
Colonel John A. Poindexter and their force of 1200 to 1500 Confederate recruits were caught at Compton Ferry along the Grand River by forces under Union Col. Odon Guitar. In seven days, Guitar's forces pursued Poindexter's for 250 miles and attacked the guerrilla forces three times. They were confronted at Switzler's mill, Little Compton (Compton's Ferry), and on the Muscle Fork of the Chariton River. Here the Federals caught the rebels in the act of crossing the river, causing great havoc and sending them into headlong retreat. Two Union artillery pieces fired a total of eight rounds producing the rout. A large amount of material was recovered.
During the battle, 150 Confederate soldiers were wounded, killed, or drowned. Another 100 soldiers were taken prisoner. The Union forces fared much better, with only 5 men being wounded and 10 horses being killed. Guitar's forces numbered 550.
Accounts of the battle were gruesome. As soldiers attempted to escape, many discarded their guns and plunged with their horses into the river. Some of the horses were able to return to shore, but many drowned. A number of soldiers with their baggage, horses, mules, guns, and wagons were captured.
The converging Union forces of Guitar and Benjamin Loan continued to pursue Poindexter's men immediately after this action, dealing them a crippling blow at the Battle of Yellow Creek. The wounded Colonel Poindexter was captured September 1 wearing civilian clothing.
Aftermath
The result of this battle and the subsequent battle at Yellow Creek was the effective suppression of Confederate recruiting efforts and major guerrilla operations north of the Missouri River in the northwest portion of the state.
Following the battles at Compton's Ferry, Yellow Creek, and other sites, Governor Gamble promoted Colonel Guitar to Brigadier-General of Enrolled Missouri Militia.

Robert Bartow Lubbers (January 10, 1922 – July 8, 2017) was an American comic strip and comic book artist best known for their work on such strips as Tarzan, Li'l Abner and Long Sam.
Biography
Born Robert Bartow Lubbers in 1922, they began as an illustrator for their school newspaper. In their teens, they played trombone in a big band five nights a week while studying during the day with George Bridgman and other instructors at the Art Students League. They entered the comic book field when they were 18 years old, as they recalled:
My pal Stan Drake and I left Bridgman's life class one day and marched down to Centaur and sold the comic mag features we'd created. Before long I was doing features at Fiction House until the War.
For Centaur (aka the Comics Corporation of America), Lubbers drew such features as the Arrow, Reef Kincaid, Red Riley and the Liberty Scouts. After Centaur folded in 1942, they signed on as art director at Fiction House, where they drew Firehair in Rangers Comics, Camilla in Jungle Comics, Señorita Rio in Fight Comics, Captain Wings in Wings, plus such features as Space Rangers, Rip Carson, Flint Baker and Captain Terry Thunder.
Remembering their first, pre-World War II employment at Fiction House, Lubbers recalled "a young teenager who'd come in now and then to show a little sample book he'd made up called Panther Lady. We could see this kid had the right stuff. They had no luck selling it to Fiction House, but it was just as well. Frank Frazetta has become a glittering star in the world of fine art."
After World War II, they returned to comic books. Fiction House "welcomed me back and features and covers poured out until 1950, when my mentor Ray Van Buren led me to UFS and Tarzan and NCS membership."
Comic strips
In 1950, they began their association with Tarzan, continuing on that strip for the next four years. In 1954, they first did work at the Al Capp studio and entered, as they put it, Capp's "star-studded world of movers and shakers".
They began drawing The Saint in 1959, and they also worked on Big Ben Bolt. Frank Godwin's Rusty Riley was running in more than 150 newspapers when Godwin died of a heart attack in 1959 at their home in New Hope, Pennsylvania. The final Rusty Riley strips were drawn by Lubbers, who recalled, "In 1959, Frank Godwin, the artist who did Rusty Riley, died. Sylvan Byck at King Features asked if I'd do the last two weeks in Godwin's style to end the series. I admired their book illustrations and was honored to have the privilege to do it." In 1960–1967, they drew Secret Agent X-9 (as "Bob Lewis"), and they contributed to Li'l Abner during the 1970s.
Lubber's own strips were Robin Malone (for NEA from 1967 through May 1970) and Long Sam, created by Al Capp and syndicated by United Feature Syndicate from 1954 to 1962. Although Long Sam was initially written by Capp, who soon turned the duties over to their brother, Elliot Caplin, Lubbers eventually assumed the writing duties themselves in the strip's final phase. Long Sam was, like Li'l Abner, a hillbilly strip, though based on a female character. The title character, Sam, was a tall, voluptuous, naive mountain girl who had been raised in a hidden valley away from civilization by their Maw, who hates men and wishes to protect their daughter from them. The stories deal with Sam's inevitable discovery of the world and its discovery of them Lubbers concluded Robin Malone in an ambiguous manner that left the survival of the protagonist unresolved.
Comic books
In addition to DC Comics' "The Vigilante" feature in Action Comics, they drew Westerns for Pines (Standard/Nedor) comics in the 1950s. They briefly drew comic books for Marvel Comics including work on The Defenders #61 (July 1978) and The Human Fly #16–17 (December 1978 – January 1979). Lubbers are sometimes mistakenly said to have drawn for DC Comics during the 1980s. A young inker named Bob Lewis did work for DC during that period, but they were not Lubbers using a pseudonym.
Reprints
In 2001, when their work was collected in the 100-page Glamour International: The Good Girl Art of Bob Lubbers, comics historian Paul Gravett reviewed:
Bob Lubbers is not the celebrated cartoonist they should be, but thanks to a legion of Italian admirers, they are now getting their day in the sunshine in their 80th year. The latest edition of the long-running Italian magazine Glamour International No. 26 (2001, $34.95) pays tribute to their Good Girl Art in a deluxe, bi-lingual 100-page, 12" x 12" inch square showcase, edited by the respected authority Alberto Beccattini. Lubbers themselves writes the commentary tracing their fascinating life and 40-year career in comics, accompanied by photos, sketches, a host of brand new colour illustrations and covers, plus some specially colored panels of their Firehair, Camilla and Captain Wings comic books from their Fiction House days in the Forties and from their string of newspaper strips, Tarzan... Long Sam, The Saint, Secret Agent X9, Robin Malone and L'il Abner. Bob credits being in the right place at the right time for keeping them busy, jumping from one series to the next or juggling several at once. But this modesty overlooks their constantly fresh and lively draughtsmanship, their crisp storytelling skills and their particular lifelong love affair with the female form, qualities that have kept them in constant demand... Writing about their experiences in the comics industry, their encounters with stars, presidents and models, their passions for playing music and golf, and their current success at devising crossword puzzles, Lubbers comes across as a genial, big-hearted man, who has always enjoyed their life and developing a variety of talents. This book concludes with the most thorough checklist of their work to date, 11 pages meticulously compiled by Beccattini with help from many experts.
Awards and exhibitions
In 1998, Lubbers was honored with the at Rome's Expo Cartoon Festival. Lubbers received an Inkpot Award in 2002. Sunday strips by Lubbers were displayed in 2003 at the Tarzan! exhibition at the Musée du quai Branly in Paris.
In 2016 they were inducted into the National Cartoonist Society's Hall of Fame, one of only 16 cartoonists to receive that honor.
Lubbers died on July 8, 2017 at the age of 95.

The gender binary (also known as gender binarism) is the classification of gender into two distinct, opposite forms of masculine and feminine, whether by social system, cultural belief, or both simultaneously. Most cultures use a gender binary, having two genders (boys/men and girls/women).
In this binary model, gender and sexuality may be assumed by default to align with one's genetic or gamete-based sex, i.e. one's sex assigned at birth. This may include certain expectations of how one dresses themselves, their behavior, sexual orientation, names or pronouns, which restroom they use, and other qualities. For example, when a male is born, gender binarism may assume that the male will be masculine in appearance, have masculine character traits and behaviors, as well as having a heterosexual attraction to females. These expectations may reinforce negative attitudes, biases, and discrimination towards people who display expressions of gender variance or nonconformity or those whose gender identity is incongruent with their birth sex.
General aspects
The term gender binary describes the system in which a society allocates its members into one of two sets of gender roles, gender identities, and attributes based on the type of genitalia they have. In the case of intersex people, those with rare genetic abnormalities which give them the sex organs of both sexes may have difficulties fitting into this system.
Scholars who study the gender binary from an intersectional feminist and critical race theory perspective argue that during the process of European colonization of the U.S., a binary system of gender was enforced as a means of protecting patriarchal norms and upholding European nationalism.
Traditional gender roles are influenced by the media, religion, mainstream education, political systems, cultural systems, and social systems. Major religions such as Islam and Christianity, in particular, act as authorities for gender roles. Islam, for example, teaches that mothers are the primary care givers to their children. The Catholic Church, the largest Christian denomination, only ordains cisgender men as priests. Christianity supports its adherence to a gender binary with the Book of Genesis in the Bible, where it is declared in verse 27 that "God created man in Their own image; in the image of God They created him; male and female They created them." Orthodox Judaism also forbids women to be ordained as rabbis and serve as clergy in their congregations.
In English, some nouns (e.g., boy), honorific titles (e.g., Miss), occupational titles (e.g., actor), and personal pronouns (e.g., she, his) are gendered, and they fall into a male/female binary. According to Hyde and colleagues, children raised within English-speaking (and other gendered-language) environments come to view gender as a binary category. They state that for children who learn English as their primary language in the U.S., adults' use of the gender binary to explicitly sort individuals (i.e. "boys" and "girls" bathrooms and sports teams), and not just the presence of gender markers, causes gender biases.
Along with using the gender binary to categorize human bodies, cultures that obey the binary may also use it to label things, places, and ideas. For example, in American culture people identify playing sports as a masculine activity and shopping as a feminine activity, blue is a color for boys while pink is for girls, care work is a feminine profession while management is associated with masculinity, etc. Some languages, like Spanish, even gender their words into masculine and feminine forms.
In the LGBT community
Gender binarism may create institutionalized structures of power, and individuals who identify outside traditional gender binaries may experience discrimination and harassment. Many LGBT people, notably youth activist groups, advocate against gender binarism. Many individuals within the LGBT+ community report an internal hierarchy of power status. Some who do not identify within a binary system experience being at the bottom of the hierarchy. The multitude of different variables such as race, ethnicity, age, gender, and more can lower or raise one's perceived power.
Worldwide, there are many individuals and several subcultures that can be considered exceptions to the gender binary or specific transgender identities. In addition to individuals whose bodies are naturally intersex, there are also specific ceremonial and social roles that are seen as third gender. The hijra of South Asia and some Two-Spirit Indigenous Peoples of North America are often cited as examples. Feminist philosopher María Lugones argues that Western colonizers imposed their dualistic ideas of gender on indigenous peoples, replacing pre-existing indigenous concepts.
In the contemporary West, non-binary or genderqueer people do not adhere to the gender binary by refusing terms like "male" and "female", as they do not identify as either. Transgender people have a unique place in relation to the gender binary. In some cases, attempting to conform to societal expectations for their gender, transgender individuals may opt for surgery, hormones, or both.
Ball culture is an example of how the LGBT community interprets and rejects the gender binary. Paris is Burning, a film directed by Jennie Livingston, depicts New York's ballroom scene in the late 1980's. To compete in the Balls, men, women, and everyone in between create costumes and walk in their respective categories: Butch Queen, Transmale Realness, and Femme Queen to name a few. During the Balls, the gender binary is thrown out the window, and the people competing are allowed to express themselves however they interpret the category. Within the scenes of people competing in various categories there's a narrative that describes life outside the gender binary in New York. Since the film came out, there's been a decline in the Ballroom scene due to the rise of media and the appropriation of the Drag culture.
Limitations
Some scholars have contested the existence of a clear gender binary. Judith Lorber explains the problem of failing to question dividing people into these two groups "even though they often find more significant within-group differences than between-group differences." Lorber argues that this corroborates the fact that the gender binary is arbitrary and leads to false expectations of both men and women. Instead, there is growing support for the possibility of utilizing additional categories that compare people without "prior assumptions about who is like whom".
This idea of a gender as a binary is thought to be an oppressive means of reflecting differential power dynamics.
In their paper "The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough", Anne Fausto-Sterling discusses the existence of intersex people, individuals possessing a combination of male and female sexual characteristics, who are seen as deviations from the norm, and who frequently undergo coercive surgery at a very young age in order to maintain the two-gender system. According to Fausto-Sterling the existence of these individuals challenges the standards of gender binaries and puts into question society's role in constructing gender. Fausto-Sterling says that modern practitioners encourage the idea that gender is a cultural construct and concludes that, "we are moving from an era of sexual dimorphism to one of variety beyond the number 2."
Cisnormativity
Cisnormativity is a product of the gender binary that assumes people are cisgender, meaning that their gender identity matches their sex assigned at birth. Both binary and nonbinary transgender individuals are excluded from this ideology. This leads to individuals outside the gender binary experiencing disparities in health and violence at individual, interpersonal, and institutional levels due to their non-normative status.
Health disparities
Gender binarism poses limitations on the adequacy of medical care provided to gender nonconforming patients. There is a large gap in medical literature on non-binary populations who have unique healthcare needs. A lack of cultural competency about nonbinary gender identities among providers contribute to nonbinary transgender individuals facing greater health disparities than both binary transgender and cisgender individuals. However, cisnormativity affects transgender individuals that identify within the gender binary as well. An individual's discomfort due to incongruence with their gender identity and sex assigned at birth used to be classified as a mental illness. "Gender identity disorder" entered the DSM-IV in 1980 and was used by doctors to pathologize transgender individuals. While it was updated to the term "gender dysphoria" when the DSM-V was published in 2013, transgender health is otherwise largely absent from medical curriculums. Health systems remain cisnormative and discriminative, which lead to adverse health outcomes for transgender populations.
Violence against transgender individuals
Transgender individuals are at a greater risk of physical and sexual intimate partner violence than cisgender individuals. The rates of intimate partner violence among transgender populations are referred to as “epidemic levels” and they are classified as a high risk population. Discrimination against transgender individuals is believed by researchers to contribute to greater risk of intimate partner violence. This is especially prominent in areas where gender identity is not legally protected against discrimination.
Transgender women of color cite both their race or ethnicity and their gender identity as factors that result in discrimination against them while white transgender women cited only their gender identity; transgender women of color experience both racism and transphobia.
Rejection
Self-expression that opposes the gender binary is stigmatized and in some cases has been criminalized. The United States has a history of laws and policies against cross-dressing, such as New York's "walking while trans" law and the informal three-article rule used during the 1940s-1960s by police to punish people that dressed in a way that defied the gender binary.
There are public figures that have opposed the gender binary by wearing clothing not typically associated with their perceived gender or their gender identity, such as Prince, David Bowie, Kurt Cobain, Jaden Smith, Ruby Rose, Rain Dove, Billy Porter, and Harry Styles. Public figures that identify as of non-binary gender include Sam Smith, Indya Moore, Brigette Lundy-Paine, King Princess, Johnathan Van Ness, Bex Taylor-Klaus, Amandla Stenberg, Demi Lovato, and more.
Harry Styles' appearance on the cover of American Vogue in 2020 was the first instance a cisgender man doing so by himself. This was groundbreaking as well as controversial due to the fact that on the cover they wore both a dress, a clothing item associated with women, and a blazer, which is associated with men. Their embrace of clothing associated with women and men is a rejection of the gender binary.
Personal pronouns in the English language are typically associated with either men (he/him) or women (she/her), which excludes people who do not identify as a man or a woman. However, gender-neutral pronouns, such as singular they pronouns (they/them) are sometimes used by nonbinary and gender nonconforming individuals. A 2019 study found that "close to 1 in 5 Americans personally know someone who uses gender-neutral pronouns such as ‘they' instead of ‘he' or “'she'”. In addition, people may use neopronouns in place of other personal pronouns. Examples of neopronouns include xe/xem, ze/zim, and sie/hir.

A general election was held in the U.S. state of Wyoming on Tuesday, November 7, 1978. All of the state's executive officers—the Governor, Secretary of State, Auditor, Treasurer, and Superintendent of Public Instruction—were up for election. Democratic Governor Edgar Herschler won a narrow re-election to a second term, and Democrat Lynn Simons was elected Superintendent of Public Instruction, narrowly defeating incumbent Republican Robert G. Schroder. Republicans won the remainder of the statewide offices.
Governor
Incumbent Democratic Governor Edgar Herschler ran for re-election to a second term, and faced former State Senator John Ostlund, the Republican nominee, in the general election. Herschler's margin of victory narrowed considerably from 1974, but they narrowly won re-election over Ostlund.
Secretary of State
Incumbent Republican Secretary of State Thyra Thomson ran for re-election to a fifth term. They faced Ed Sencabaugh, an executive with the Union Pacific Railroad and a former State Representative, in the Republican primary. They handily defeated him, and advanced to the general election. No Democratic candidates filed to oppose Thomson, though Robert Warburton, a college student, received 54 write-in votes and was offered the nomination. They ultimately declined it, leaving the Democrats with no candidate and Thomson with no opponent, enabling them to win re-election unopposed.

But Jim Polis, a bank examiner in the State Examiner's office, received enough write-in votes to receive their party's nomination, which they accepted. However, Polis did not present significant challenge to Griffith, who won re-election by a lopsided margin.

Incumbent Republican State Treasurer Ed Witzenburger was unable to seek re-election due to term limits and instead opted to run for Congress, ultimately losing to Dick Cheney in the Republican primary. In the Republican primary, Deputy Treasurer Shirley Wittler won a narrow victory over Craig L. Thomas. In the general election, they faced former State Representative Bob Adams, a perennial candidate for statewide office. They defeated Adams in a landslide, becoming only the second woman, after Minnie A. Mitchell, to serve as State Treasurer.

Incumbent Republican Superintendent of Public Instruction Robert G. Schrader ran for re-election to a third term. They faced a strong challenge in the Republican primary from Converse County Superintendent of Schools Millard I. Meredith. Though Schrader defeated Meredith, they did so by a relatively close margin. In the Democratic primary, meanwhile, Lynn Simons, the former Chairwoman of the Wyoming Board of Education, defeated Sydney Spiegel, a history teacher who ran as the 1974 Democratic nominee for Superintendent. Simons ultimately defeated Schrader by a slim margin, receiving the highest percentage of vote of any statewide Democratic candidate.

Giovanni Antonio Tagliente (sometimes written Giovannantonio) (c. 1460s – c. 1528) was a calligrapher, author, printer and publisher based in Venice during the Renaissance period.
Tagliente began their life as a calligrapher and taught around Italy before returning to Venice in 1491. They worked for the Venetian Chancery and was given a sinecure by the senate, becoming a publisher late in life.
Tagliente's publications were textbooks and self-help volumes. These included guides on learning to read, arithmetic, accounting, embroidery patterns, textile production and a book of model love letters. Some of their books were very popular and were issued in dozens of editions. They have come to attention of feminist and social historians for their promotion of reading for women and the uneducated; their textbook on reading aimed to teach reading "in a period of two months, more or less depending on the intelligence of the reader." They also wrote for a target market of potential civil servants. Tagliente published a writing manual, The True Art of Excellent Writing or Lo presente libro, in Venice in 1524, with engravings and some text set in an italic typeface presumably based on their calligraphy.
Tagliente's typeface was an inspiration for historically inclined typeface designers in modern times, becoming the inspiration for the italic of the popular 1928 book typeface Bembo. Historian Alfred F. Johnson reprinted their work, along with their contemporary Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi.

The Rans S-7 Courier is an American single-engined, tractor configuration, two-seats in tandem, high-wing monoplane designed by Randy Schlitter and manufactured by Rans Inc. The Courier is available in kit form for amateur construction or as a completed light-sport aircraft.
Design and development
The S-7 was originally conceived of as a trainer for the single seat S-4 Coyote. First flown in November 1985 the Courier was named for an aircraft that Schlitter admired, the Helio Courier.
The S-7 features a welded 4130 steel tube cockpits, with a bolted aluminum tube rear fuselage, wing and tail surfaces all covered in dope and fabric. The reported construction times for the Courier are 500-700 man-hours.
The Courier is available only with conventional landing gear but can be equipped with floats and skis. The original basic engine was the Rotax 503 of , with the Rotax 582 of being available as an option. Today the standard engine is the Rotax 912ULS. At least one S7 has been fitted with a Jabiru 2200 flat-four, four-stroke direct-drive engine.
Operational history
325 examples of the Courier had been completed by December 2007. In November 2010 74 were on the registers of European countries west of Russia.
Reviewer Marino Boric said in a 2015 review, that, "this refined little fun flyer...continues to prove itself deservedly popular."
In a extensive review in December 2020, AVweb writer Dave Prizio praised the design's ergonomics and economics, "a nice feature of the S-7 is its ample 30-inch-wide cabin. Even for large people, there is no need to squeeze into an S-7 the way you might into a Cub. It will pretty much do the same thing as a Super Cub at a lower operating cost."
Variants
S-7
Initial version, standard engine Rotax 503, Rotax 582 engine optional.
S-7C
Refined version introduced in 2001, certified under the US primary category. Certification in the category took seven years of effort by the manufacturer and was not a commercial success as the primary aircraft category was not widely adopted.
S-7S
Kit version of the S-7C, introduced in 2003. Qualifies as a US Experimental light-sport aircraft (ELSA). Standard engine is the Rotax 912ULS.
S-7LS
Sold as a factory-assembled ready-to-fly US Special light-sport aircraft, the S-7LS is a factory-assembled version of the S-7S. Standard engine is the Rotax 912ULS.

Charles Brigham (June 21, 1841 – July 1925) was an American architect based in Boston, Massachusetts.
Life
Brigham was born, raised, and educated in Watertown, Massachusetts schools and graduated at age 15 in 1856 in the first class of Watertown High School. They had no formal education in architecture.
They apprenticed to Calvin Ryder and later to Boston architect Gridley J.F. Bryant. Brigham served as a sergeant in the Union Army during the American Civil War, then returned to working with Bryant. In 1866, Brigham and John Hubbard Sturgis formed a partnership which lasted 20 year. In that times the firm was recognized for its innovative and groundbreaking designs, including the original building for the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.
Brigham subsequently designed the 1898 annex to the Massachusetts State House in Boston, the 1906 The First Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston, and many residential buildings especially in the Boston Back Bay and Newport Rhode Island.
Brigham's work reflects the eclecticism and historicism prevalent in the last quarter of the 19th century, initiating fusion of the complex eclectic references of the English Queen Anne revival with American colonial design. The resulting coastal New England houses of the 1880s by Brigham and other Boston architects defined the shingle style in one of the most original and distinguished epochs of American architectural history, from which other notable architects, such as Henry Hobson Richardson, emerged. They also designed the Watertown town seal.

Bolkar Mountains, also known as Bulgar Dagh or Bolghar Dagh, are a mountain range situated in the middle part of the Taurus mountains complex in southern Turkey bounded by the Göksu River to the west and the Pozantı River to the east. The northern part of the mountains lies in Niğde province, while the southern peaks rise in Mersin province.
Economy
In the early 20th-century, the mountains were noted as having large amounts of lead. A mine active in the region since 1825 was Bulgar Maden. As of 1920 it was still producing lead as a Turkish government ran enterprise. The ore from this mine was 44.2 percent lead. Silver and gold were occasionally found in the mines. The mine used a low quality smelting technique, which often threatened the quality of the product, leaving much of it lost. The gold and silver findings were sent to Istanbul for smelting.
Fauna
Montivipera bulgardaghica is a venomous viper species endemic originated from this mountain range.

Prince Georgy Aleksandrovich Gruzinsky (; 2 November 1762 – 15 May 1852) was a Russian nobleman of royal Georgian descent. An influential landowner and official in Nizhny Novgorod, they were known for their authoritarian rule over their estates as well as charity. During Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812, they raised a local militia force to fight the French.
Family background
Prince Georgy Gruzinsky was born into the family of Alexander Gruzinsky of the House of Mukhrani, claimant to the throne of Georgia, and their wife Daria Menshikova. Georgy was, thus, grandson of Bakar of Kartli and great-grandson of King Vakhtang VI of Kartli on their father's side and great-grandson of the Russian statesman Aleksandr Menshikov on their mother's side.
Career
Prince Georgy succeeded to the familial domain of Lyskovo on the Volga, which they ruled as a local "tsar". Beyond Lyskovo, Gruzinsky owned estates in the cities of Nizhny Novgorod and Moscow. Lyskovo at that time housed St. Nino's Cross, the principal relic of Georgian Christianity, brought from Ottoman-occupied Georgia for Georgy's grandfather Bakar.
Prince Georgy was enlisted in the Saint-Petersburg Infantry Regiment in 1768 and retired with the rank of major in 1778. Beyond Georgian and Russian, they commanded French, German, and Italian, and was interested in history, geography, architecture, mathematics, physics, military engineering, and artillery. A theatre lover, they formed and sponsored a troupe for their own entertainment. They were elected marshal of the nobility of the Nizhny Novgorod Governorate for two consecutive three-year terms in 1795 and again in 1798. Soon Gruzinsky fell in disfavor with the tsar Paul I. They were found guilty of cruel treatment of their peasants and various machinations, but Gruzisnky evaded the court sentence by faking death and staging their own funeral, having bribed local officials. They remained in obscurity until the accession of Alexander I who made him, in 1802, an Actual Chamberlain and appointed to a Court of Conscience in Nizhny Novgorod whence they resigned in 1804. They were reelected as the governorate's marshal of nobility in 1807 and continued to serve in this capacity for the following 21 years until removed by Nicholas I for disregard of the Russian laws.
During Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812, Gruzinsky organized and headed the Nizhny Novgorod militia, which amounted to 12,440 men and fought under General Nikolay Muromtsyev against the Grande Armée until the fall of Paris in 1814. After the war, Gruzinsky spent the rest of their life in Lyskovo, dispensing charity. In the 1820s, they hosted and supported Anton II, a Georgian prelate dispossessed by the Russian authorities of their office. In 1852, Gruzinsky died at the age of 89 at their estate, allegedly in a fury at the sight of a peasant entering their house with a hat. They were interred at a familial burial ground at the Transfiguration Church of Lyskovo.
Marriage and children
Georgy Gruzinsky was married to Princess Varvara Nikolayevna Bakhmetyeva, by whom they had two children: Anna (31 January 1798 – 17 July 1889) and Ivan; the latter died at a very young age. Furthermore, Prince Gruzinsky had several purported extramarital children, of whom Andrey Medvedev and Yevgraf Stogov are the best known. Gruzinsky themselves claimed Medvedev as their son in order to prevent their daughter Anna from marrying him. In despair, Medvedev took a monastic oath and became a well-known cleric in Nizhny. Anna eventually married Count Alexander Pyetrovich Tolstoy, without issue.

In music, a chop chord is a "clipped backbeat". In : . It is a muted chord that marks the off-beats or upbeats. As a rhythm guitar and mandolin technique, it is accomplished through chucking, in which the chord is muted by lifting the fretting fingers immediately after strumming, producing a percussive effect.
Traditional bluegrass bands typically do not have a drummer, and the timekeeping role is shared between several instruments. The upright bass generally plays the on-beats, while the banjo keeps a steady eighth-note rhythm. The mandolin plays chop chords on the off-beats or upbeats. (see: boom-chick) By partially relaxing the fingers of the left hand soon after strumming, the strings are allowed to rise off the frets, and their oscillations are damped by the fingers. All strings are stopped (fingered); open strings are not played in chop chords.
The offbeat was played on the piano in rhythm and blues "shuffle" style, as heard in songs like Louis Jordan's "It's a Low-Down Dirty Shame" (1942) and Professor Longhair's "Wille Mae" (1949). This popular, danceable shuffle style was present on many early rock and roll records. It was played on the electric guitar at least as early as 1950 by Robert Kelton on Jimmy McCracklin's "Rockin' All Day." Either played on the guitar, piano or both, the "chop", "chuck" or "skank" offbeat eventually influenced Jamaican rhythm and blues of the 1950s, which morphed into ska in late 1962, then rocksteady and reggae, all of which featured the offbeat "chuck" or "skank" guitar.
Guitar
The "chuck" usually consists of a downward strum on the up beat notes. Alternatively, the bass note can be played and allowed to ring, with the remainder of the chord being "chucked" on the up beat. This technique is usually used in a rhythmically simple manner, such as chucking on every beat, or bass notes on downbeats and chucking on up beats. Freddie Green, Django Reinhardt and Nile Rodgers are known for this technique.
Mandolin
Mandolin "chunks", or more commonly known as "chops", rarely include a down-beat strum. When a mandolin is playing rhythm it is most often in conjunction with other instruments, such as guitar and bass, which produce the main beat. The mandolin contributes to the rhythm by producing a sharp "chunk" on the upbeat notes. This is particularly common when playing bluegrass music. According to Andy Statman, "the mandolin can drive and push the band in the same way (as) a snare drum."
Fiddle
The chop was introduced to fiddle playing by Richard Greene in the 1960s.

Floral Isolation is a form of reproductive isolation found in angiosperms. Reproductive isolation is the process of species evolving mechanisms to prevent reproduction with other species. In plants, this is accomplished through the manipulation of the pollinator's behavior (ethological isolation) or through morphological characteristics of flowers that favor intraspecific pollen transfer (morphological isolation). Preventing interbreeding prevents hybridization and gene flow between the species (introgression), and consequently protects genetic integrity of the species. Reproductive isolation occurs in many organisms, and floral isolation is one form present in plants. Floral isolation occurs prior to pollination, and is divided into two types of isolation: morphological isolation and ethological isolation. Floral isolation was championed by Verne Grant in the 1900s as an important mechanism of reproductive isolation in plants.
Morphological Isolation
Mechanical or morphological isolation is a form of floral isolation where the characteristics of the flower prevents reproduction between species. These morphological differences primarily affect the positioning of reproductive structures within flowers and control the placement of pollen on the pollinator's body to promote transfer within the same species. For example, flowers of Salvia mellifera have anthers and stigmas which are positioned to contact the dorsal surface of the bumblebee abdomen while flowers of the co-occurring Salvia apiana place pollen on the bumblebee's flanks.
Ethological Isolation
Ethological isolation is a form of floral isolation caused predominantly by the behavior of pollinators. Flowers can have morphological features which attract or reward specific types of pollinators. The relationship between floral signals and pollinators can promote floral constancy, where different pollinators preferentially visit one species over other others. The color or odor of flowers promotes this isolation as plants effectively manipulate the behavior of their animal pollinators. An example of this type of manipulation is found in orchids as they mimic female bees and wasps in order to attract male pollinators as a form of sexual deception referred to as pseudocopulation.

The Bhim Army, alternatively Bheem Army (lit."Ambedkar Army") or the Bheem Army Bharat Ekta Mission (translation: "Ambedkar Army Indian Unity Mission") is an Ambedkarite and Dalit rights organisation in India. It was founded by Satish Kumar, Vinay Ratan Singh and Chandra Shekhar Aazad in 2015. The organisation runs more than 350 free schools for Dalits and Bahujans in the districts of Saharanpur, Meerut, Shamli and Muzaffarnagar in western Uttar Pradesh. The organisation is named after B. R. Ambedkar.
Mission
Bhim Army's stated mission is "direct action based on confrontation to preserve or restore the dignity of Dalit" and it has an estimated 20,000 followers in the Saharanpur region, which has a 20% Dalit population. The Bhim Army is aimed at supporting the marginalized sections of society such as Dalits and farmers, and more broadly what the founder of the organisation Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan describes as "the Bahujan community which includes SCs, STs, OBCs and minorities who had been away from the mainstream for long". They have said that "We may even gherao the Vidhan Sabha in support of our demands". They have sought to build a coalition between Dalit and Muslims against the BJP, and has described themselves as a supporter of the Indian Constitution and an opponent of theocracy and manuvāda ideology.
History
Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan founded the Bhim Army in 2015 to protect constitutional rights and oppose caste oppression. The group formed after reports of discrimination and caste-based violence faced by Dalit students at AHP Inter-college in Uttar Pradesh, and the Bhim Army then helped protect the Dalit students.
Azad gained attention after publicly posting a sign which read "The Great Chamar of Dhadkauli Welcome You." Upper-caste Thakurs were upset with the Dalit celebration of identity and objected to the erection of the board. But, the Bhim Army intervened and ensure that the Thakurs did not unleash any violence. In another incident, the Thakurs prevented a Dalit groom from riding a horse to their wedding. Yet again, the Bhim Army intervened and escorted the groom.
The Bhim Army attained national prominence after clashes in Uttar Pradesh. In June 2017, the group's leader Chandrashekhar, a lawyer, was arrested by the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force. Chandrashekhar was granted bail by the Allahabad High Court in November 2017, but the Uttar Pradesh government led by Yogi Adityanath continued to detain them under the National Security Act until it dropped the NSA order in September 2018 and acquitted Chandrashekhar from jail. Chandrashekhar describes themselves as a representative of Bahujan identity and a follower of Kanshi Ram.
The group protests against discrimination and caste violence against Dalit by members of the upper Thakurs caste in violent clashes in 2017 in Saharanpur. A Bhim Army rally in Jantar Mantar, New Delhi in 2017 was attended by a large crowd, estimated to be 10,000 by Delhi Police.
In August 2019, the Bhim Army took part in nationwide Dalit protests against the demolition of Shri Guru Ravidas Gurughar, a temple dedicated to Sant Ravidas in Tughlaqabad, Delhi, on the orders of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), following lengthy litigation between the DDA and Guru Ravidas Jainti Samaroh Samiti. Dozens of people, including Chandrashekhar and Vinay Ratan, were arrested by police, prompting the Bhim Army to demand their release.
In December 2019, Chandrashekhar announced that the Bhim Army would formally enter electoral politics. The group previously operated as a quasi-political force. Chandrashekhar stated that "We tried to join hands and work unitedly with the Bahujan Samaj Party but its leader was unwilling to do so." Chandrashekhar said the new political party would set up an office in Lucknow and work to counter the ruling BJP. Chandrashekhar has described the BJP as their chief political adversary, but has also competed with Mayawati, the leader of the Bahujan Samaj Party.
The Bhim Army opposes the BJP's Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) legislation In January and February 2020, the Bhim Army engaged in the protests against the CAA and sought its repeal. In February 2020, street clashes took place between pro-CAA BJP supporters and Bhim Army supporters in connection with the North East Delhi riots; both sides engaged in stone-pelting.
On 15 March 2020, Chandrashekhar officially announced their new political party named Azad Samaj Party. As many as 98 former leaders of the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Indian National Congress and Rashtriya Lok Dal joined the newly launched party.

Eden is a British pay television channel broadcasting factual content in the United Kingdom and Ireland as part of the UKTV network of channels. The channel originally launched on 8 March 2004 and relaunched in its current format on 27 January 2009.
History
The UKTV channels were all rebranded on 8 March 2004. At the same time, Eden was launched as UKTV Documentary, showing factual documentaries, mainly from the BBC archives, on a variety of subjects if not covered by another channel in the UKTV network, such as Jacob Bronowski's The Ascent of Man. Much of this programming had come from the former UKTV channel UK Horizons, which had closed down the day before and which the channel, and spun off a sister channel called UKTV People. UKTV Documentary occupied the same broadcasting slot as UK Horizons.
On 9 October 2008, UKTV announced plans to rebrand UKTV Documentary and UKTV People in early 2009. The news came just two days after UKTV's entertainment channels were rebranded to Watch, Gold and Alibi. They announced that UKTV Documentary would be rebranded as Eden and this rebrand took place on 26 January 2009. As part of the rebranding, the channels programming output changed from all documentaries to primarily documentaries focusing on the natural environment. All other documentaries were transferred to UKTV History or UKTV People, depending on their subject matter.
Subsidiary channels
Eden +1
From launch, the channel has had a timeshift service, called Eden +1 and UKTV Documentary +1 before it. The service ran on Sky and Virgin Media and broadcast the channels schedule one hour later than usual. The timeshift was removed from Virgin Media in October 2008 to allow bandwidth for new channel Watch, however the time shift service was restored on 7 October 2011.
Eden HD
Eden HD launched on 4 October 2010 on Sky channel 559, running a high-definition simulcast of the main channel. As part of Virgin Media's deal to sell its share of UKTV, all five of UKTV's HD channels were added to Virgin's cable television service by 2012. Eden HD was added to Virgin Media on 7 October 2011. On 3 October 2016, Eden HD was added to BT. On 2 October 2017, Eden HD was removed from the Sky lineup and replaced with Gold HD.
On-air identity
The UKTV Documentary identity focused around scenes from the landscape of Britain. The ident would first feature a close up shot, for example of a person or a stone, before pulling back to reveal the bigger picture: such as a busy rail station or a stone circle. This was then overlaid with the UKTV Documentary logo, consisting of the UKTV logo on top, and an upper case 'DOCUMENTARY' tag below, aligned to the left of the screen. Alongside the idents, the channel had a Digital on-screen graphic (DOG) of the same design and also featured a generic UKTV design for all promotions for the channel. The channels house colour was a blue, similar in shade to Azure, and would feature in numerous changing shades on the end boards of promotions.
The current Eden identity features explorers in an unknown environment, such as the deep jungle or the Antarctic, before coming across a landscape, which the logo then forms onto.
Programming
The programming used on the channel is mostly from the BBC archives, and are therefore edited to fit the time slot: an original broadcast for an hour-long programme on the BBC might be as much as 58 minutes long, while the same programme here might be 42 minutes long without the commercials. Eden is renowned for showing blue-chip natural history but has more recently moved into more scientific programmes while keeping the blue-chip, cinematic identity. Eden has also produced its own exclusive programming, with the most recent series David Attenborough's Natural Curiosities, produced by Humble Bee Films, broadcasting from January 2013.

The Kleihauer–Betke ("KB") test, Kleihauer–Betke ("KB") stain, Kleihauer test or acid elution test is a blood test used to measure the amount of fetal hemoglobin transferred from a fetus to a mother's bloodstream. It is usually performed on Rh-negative mothers to determine the required dose of Rho(D) immune globulin (RhIg) to inhibit formation of Rh antibodies in the mother and prevent Rh disease in future Rh-positive children. It is named after Enno Kleihauer and Klaus Betke who described it in 1957.
Test details
The KB test is the standard method of quantitating fetal–maternal hemorrhage (FMH). It takes advantage of the differential resistance of fetal hemoglobin to acid. A standard blood smear is prepared from the mother's blood and exposed to an acid bath. This removes adult hemoglobin, but not fetal hemoglobin, from the red blood cells. Subsequent staining, using Shepard's method, makes fetal cells (containing fetal hemoglobin) appear rose-pink in color, while adult red blood cells are only seen as "ghosts". 2,000 cells are counted under the microscope and a percentage of fetal to maternal cells is calculated.
In those with positive tests, follow-up testing at a postpartum check should be done to rule out the possibility of a false positive. This could be caused by a hemoglobinopathy in the mother which causes persistent elevation of fetal hemoglobin, e.g. sickle cell trait.
Comparison with other more expensive or technologically advanced methods such as flow cytometry has shown that the KB stain, like the more advanced methods, is sensitive in its detection of FMH. Background counting errors can result in estimates of as much as 5 mL fetal blood loss when there actually is no such blood loss, but standard methods available in most laboratories admit an extremely low probability of the return of a false positive when more severe FMH has taken place.
Original Technique
Method
Thin smears are prepared from capillary blood or venous blood collected into anticoagulants such as heparine, oxalate, citrate, or EDTA. Smears are air dried between 10–60 minutes, fixed in 80 vol% ethanol for 5 min at 20-22 °C, rinsed with tap water, and air dried. Films are then immersed in the citrate-phosphate buffer for 5 minutes at 37 °C and gently agitated for about 3 minutes. Slides are rinsed with tap water, dried, and stained with Ehrlich's acid hematoxylin for 3 min, rinsed with water, and dried again. They are counterstained with erythrosine for 3 min. After a final rinse, films are dried and examined under light microscopy.
Results of the original method
Hemoglobin F cells are densely stained with erythrosine, Hemoglobin A cell appear as ghost cells, while intermediate cells are stained more or less pink. Reticulocytes containing Hemoglobin A may appear as intermediate cells and/or may show intracellular granulation. Inclusion bodies (Heinz bodies, precipitated α-chains or β-chains) are visible in eluted cells as compact inclusions of different size. Hemoglobin A is eluted regardless of whether it is oxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, cyanmethemoglobin, reduced hemoglobin, or carboxyhemoglobin.
Quantitation of Hemoglobin F Cells
Methods developed by Schneider and Ludwig and Bartsch' are recommended. For determination of the intracellular distribution of Hemoglobin F, the semi-quantitative method of Shepard, Weatherall, and Conley' may be employed.
Normal Values
Normal values for Hemoglobin F cells in adults as published originally by Kleihauer were below 0.01%; in full-term newborns they are above 90%.
Uses
Fetal–maternal hemorrhage severity estimation
To determine if a positive test for FMH indicates the likely cause of fetal death, the percent of total fetal blood volume lost should be calculated, making appropriate adjustments based on the following known relationships:
the size of a fetal red blood cell is 1.22 times that of an adult red blood cell;
the KB stain is known to have a mean success rate of 92% in detecting fetal red blood cells;
in a woman at or near term in their pregnancy, the mean volume of maternal red blood cells is approximately 1800 ml;
the mean fetal hematocrit is 50%; and
at stillbirth, the mean fetal blood volume is
These constraints can then be applied to yield the formula
where
is the percentage of fetal blood lost;
is the observed number of fetal red blood cells;
is the observed number of maternal red blood cells (N.B. we have that , where is the total observed number of red blood cells, both maternal and fetal);
is the stillbirth weight of the fetus in kilograms.
Number of RhD vials
An estimate of the required number of Rho(D) immune globulin vials may assume the following equations:
Volume (mL) of Fetal Blood = % Fetal Cells x 50
Number of Vials of 300 mcg RhIG Required = Volume of Fetal Blood/30mL
Combining those two equations results in:
Number of vials = % Fetal Cells x 50 / 30
This is approximately equal to:
Number of vials = % Fetal Cells x 1.7
Practically, if the number to the right of the decimal point is ≥5, it is rounded up to add one vial.
Stillbirth resolution
Suppose that a KB stain is performed and total red blood cells are observed, of which are found to be fetal red blood cells. Suppose further that the stillbirth weight of the fetus under consideration is . Then we would conclude that the total percentage of fetal blood lost is approximately:
to five significant digits. We would hence conclude that the fetus under consideration lost 66.667% (two-thirds) of its blood via FMH. Generally, stillbirth is highly probable for any value of , particularly if the fetus abruptly loses this much blood; in this example, we would hence be likely to suspect FMH as the cause of the stillbirth. It is important to note, however, that such a diagnosis is still not completely conclusive; fetuses losing large quantities of blood over long periods of time are able to compensate for this slower blood loss; since the KB stain tells us nothing with regard to the level of acuity of FMH. This means that it is not possible to entirely correlate a positive KB stain and high with a stillbirth, though in many cases, given other information, such as known hereditary complications of pregnancy, extremely high positive correlation coefficients between FMH and stillbirth have been observed.
Fetal red-blood-cell detection problems
Since fetal and maternal blood cells have the same life expectancy in the maternal bloodstream, it is possible to obtain informative results from a KB stain for a fair period of time after a stillbirth. However, if the mother and fetus are ABO incompatible, it is more crucial to quickly perform the KB stain following a stillbirth, as the fetal red blood cells will be eliminated from the maternal bloodstream quickly, causing the KB stain to underestimate the degree of FMH, if any. Much concern has been raised in the literature concerning false positives when sampling is done after delivery. In general this is not a problem. Delivery does result in higher frequency of detection of micro-hemorrhages but this should not confound interpretation of FMH as a possible cause of stillbirth. It is not necessary to draw the sample before induction, onset of labor, delivery, placental delivery etc. despite what some published literature purports. However, if Caesarean section is to be used, failure to draw the sample prior to that will result in a 2% false positive rate.
Finally, anything which causes persistence of fetal hemoglobin in maternal blood cells will make interpretation much trickier. Certain hemoglobinopathies, the most common of which is sickle cell trait, do this. Overall, somewhere around 1–3% of the time this could result in false interpretation.
All cases of maternal trauma
An article published in 2004 concluded that a Kleihauer-Betke (KB) test is necessary in all cases of maternal trauma, as clinical evaluation is not sensitive enough for determination of risk of pre-term labour. It accurately predicts the risk of preterm labor after maternal trauma whereas the article concluded that clinical assessment does not. With a negative KB test, posttrauma electronic fetal monitoring duration may be limited safely. With a positive KB test, the significant risk of pre-term labour mandates detailed monitoring. KB testing has important advantages to all maternal trauma victims, regardless of Rh status.

1930 saw the Argentine league restructured as a league of 36 teams, playing one another once. The eventual champions were Boca Juniors. Following the disruption of the 1929 season by mass abandonment of games, the second half of the 1930 season was marred in a similar way. This trend was halted by the inception of the professional era in 1931.
The Argentina national team reached the final of the first FIFA World Cup where they lost to Uruguay.
Primera División
Relegation
The teams occupying the bottom two positions of the league were relegated. Argentino del Sud set one of the worst points tallies in the history of South American football. The other team, Honor y Patria, was relegated in its first season at the top level.

A seat filler is a person who fills in an empty seat during an event. There are two types of seat fillers:
A person who subscribes to a seat-filling theatre club. Members of these clubs help fill in unsold seats for theatre, music, film, sporting events, dance performances and other live events. The producers of the event give complimentary tickets to the seat-filling organization, who pass them on to their members. The producers get a fuller audience and therefore a better experience for the paying patrons (and talent), while the seat-filler is able to see an event for a small service charge. Within the industry, this is also referred to as "papering the house".Some seat-filling companies charge no surcharge per ticket and only a membership based fee. This model is popular in cities with a larger number of shows and therefore a higher number of tickets to go around.
A person who takes up spare seats when the person allocated the seat is elsewhere. An example of this is the Academy Awards in which members of the audience are on the stage receiving their awards, or because they are involved in producing the show. Seat fillers are primarily employed so that when TV cameras show audience shots, there are no empty seats.
Benefits to the Shows
Increased awareness of their show (especially helpful if new)
Higher concession sales
Fuller audience for a better show experience
Marketing to a vocal audience
Private and no cost. Most seat filler services offer their service for free to the shows with an attached promise that their members will not publicly state where they received the tickets from as to not impact future sales
In popular culture
In the Two and a Half Men episode "My Doctor Has a Cow Puppet", Charlie tries to set up Alan with one of their friends who work as a seat filler at award ceremonies.
In the Seinfeld episode "The Summer of George", Kramer works as a seat filler at the Tony Awards.
The plot of the 2004 movie The Seat Filler revolves around a seat-filler who meets a burgeoning pop star during an event.
In the movie Now You See Me, they mention that the audience are a bunch of seat fillers.
In the Family Guy episode "Call Girl", Peter works as a seat filler for babies during ultrasounds.
At the 87th Academy Awards, Neil Patrick Harris mentioned the seat fillers, explaining their meaning, and joked with Steve Carell as if they were a seat filler.
In The Simpsons episode The Mansion Family, a seat filler takes Homer Simpson's seat at an award.

It is situated on Masson Street, in the heart of the Vieux-Rosemont neighbourhood.
History
One of the Gothic Revival style bell towers was withdrawn in 1949 due to explosions of nearby mines that made it unstable.
One of the art-deco style lamps, located on the forecourt of the church, was stolen during the North American ice storm of 1998.
Characteristics
The church has a Casavant Frères organ, which was damaged due to water infiltration in the 1990s, but is almost completely restored now.
It was built with gray limestone from the quarries nearby.
The windows are the work of artist Guido Nincheri.

A locum, or locum tenens, is a person who temporarily fulfills the duties of another; the term is especially used for physicians or clergy. For example, a locum tenens physician is a physician who works in the place of the regular physician when that physician is absent, or when a hospital or practice is short-staffed. These professionals are still governed by their respective regulatory bodies, despite the transient or freelance nature of their positions. Other positions can be held as locum, particularly social workers, counselors, nurses and other professionals.
Locum tenens is a Latin phrase meaning "placeholder", akin to the French lieutenant. The abbreviated form "locum" is common in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom; unlike in Latin its plural is locums. In the United States, the full length "" (plural: ) is preferred, though for some particular roles, alternative expressions (e.g., "substitute teacher") may be more commonly used.
In UK healthcare
In the United Kingdom, the NHS on average has 3,500 locum doctors working in hospitals on any given day, with another 17,000 locum general practitioners. Many of these locum hospital doctors are supplied by private agencies through a national framework agreement that the NHS holds with fifty-one private agencies. NHS figures show that approximately eighty percent of hospital locum positions are filled by agencies on this framework. The remaining twenty percent are filled by agencies working outside this agreement. Locum agencies are common reference points for doctors wishing to work in this market. According to a report published by Royal College of Surgeons, the NHS spent approximately £467 million on locum doctors through agencies in the year 2010.
On the other hand, GP locums (freelance general practitioners) mostly work independently from locum agencies either as self-employed or via freelance GP chambers based on the NASGP's Sessional GP Support Team (SGPST) model. Some GPs have been employed by the primary care trusts (PCTs) to provide locum cover. However, PCTs were abolished in 2013 and replaced by the clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). CCGs are now starting to employ salaried GPs with locum roles. Locum GPs are expected to be flexible, adaptable, resourceful, professional, quick to establish relationships, familiar with different IT systems, and able to independently manage risks.
Advantages and disadvantages
Locums provide a ready means for organizations to fill positions that are either temporarily vacant or for which no longterm funding is available. Working as a locum allows a professional to gain experience in a variety of work environments or specialties.
Some locum recruitment agencies offer pre-employment training to foreign medical graduates before their first professional experience in the primary care system.
However, the locum situation also poses a number of disadvantages: the transient nature of the assignment means extra stress and work for locums whenever they assume a new position, and for the hiring organisation, this generally means that the required flexibility and lack of guaranteed income must be rewarded with higher compensation. These may in the long term create higher costs for the hiring organisation than adding more full-time positions, especially in highly skilled professions, and unlike the situation in some professions where cheap temporary labour or significant use of interns actually undercuts wages and reduces total staff costs.
In professions that require knowledge of patient histories, locums may provide work of lower quality or be perceived as doing so. They may experience resentment from permanent staff because they are paid more or considered shouldering less responsibility.

Auto auctions are a method of selling vehicles based on an auction system. Auto auctions can be found in most countries and are usually exclusive to licensed automobile dealers. In a few countries, such as Japan, auto auctions are well known and used by most residents.
Country specific
Japan
Auto auctions are the most popular method to sell used vehicles in Japan. Most customers are Japanese seeking a cheap vehicle to start with or replace their older vehicle. There are many also trying to sell their vehicles. Individuals though cannot directly use auto auctions, but must go through those holding auction membership. In Japanese law, only dealerships may become members to auto auctions. The system allows people to have access to information, but keeps the auctions orderly with only professionals actually able to bid.
A small percentage of the dealers that are members of Japanese auto auctions are also used vehicle exporters that most often use the auto auctions as their primary source of used vehicles. Other than these exporters, most members are used vehicle dealerships that sell in Japan and are used by Japanese people to find a car they want.
In Japan there are over 30 well known auto auction groups and over 200 auto auction locations throughout Japan. Additionally, there are smaller auctions held for specialized items. Furthermore, large numbers of cars in Japan are auctioned online, using various types of auction software. Auction inspection sheets allow buyers and inspectors to evaluate the worth of a car over such systems.
United States
In the United States, auto auctions play a major role as a wholesale market for second-hand vehicles. Most states only allow closed auctions, meaning only dealers can use them. As of 2018, there were 139 used car-auction sites in the US open only to car dealers. There are also auctions that are open to the public in a few states like New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. These auctions are a primary outlet for financial services firms to dispose of their large volume of off-lease returns, for rental and other companies to sell off their aging fleets and for car dealerships to dump trade-ins or other unwanted inventory. Some auctions in the United States are used by banks, the IRS, and other government agencies to sell vehicles that were repossessed for failure to make monthly payments or pay taxes, or were seized by the FBI, DEA, or the police. Also, there are some that sell US Government vehicles and those catering to the salvage market where insurance companies sell totaled vehicles. Finally, there is a niche classic and luxury car market for $1 million-plus cars.
Online auto auctions are also growing in popularity. One of the most popular online auctions to buy cars from is eBay Motors. On eBay Motors, any user can create an account and put their vehicle(s) up for auction even if they are from a state that only allows closed auctions. There is usually a fee associated with selling a vehicle on eBay. Some buyers prefer to look for local car sellers on eBay, within a certain radius so that they can go and do a manual inspection of the vehicle. There are several cases of scams associated with popular online auctions.
With the reduction in travel in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, United States-based auto auctions companies, like Illinois-based Insurance Auto Auctions and Copart in Dallas, saw rapid growth as rental companies shrunk their fleets significantly. This has drawn some controversy, with numerous race tracks being sold and repurposed as storage facilities for these companies.
United Kingdom
The majority of vehicles entered into auction in the UK are ex-company fleet vehicles and as such usually have a good service history and have been well kept. Car dealer groups also take advantage of auto auctions in order to sell on any excess stock whilst smaller, local car dealers will use them to fill spaces on their forecourts. Auctions in the UK are also used by banks, local and central Governments, private sellers, and car dealerships.
Dealer auto auctions
A dealer auto auction is a specialized form of auction. Millions of vehicles are sold at such dealer auto auctions every year. These auctions are restricted to the general public and only licensed dealers can participate. Prices of vehicles sold at dealer auctions tend to be lower than those advertised on any dealer's lot. Sellers forgo a potentially higher sticker price to take their inventory to a dealer auction where it will be auctioned off for less than retail for a number of reasons.
Maintaining aging inventory costs dealers both money and reputation. Most vehicles sold are off-lease returns, replaced rental fleets, company cars, repossessed vehicles, and trade-ins.
Off-lease: vehicles returned to the financial institution at the end of a lease term. Closed auctions are usually the only venue for such financial institutions to dispose of a large volume of end-of-lease returns. The terms of a lease normally put a restriction on the number of miles driven, require regular maintenance, and penalize for excessive wear. Usually, off-lease vehicles are returned within 2–3 years, often before their original factory warranty expires.
Off-rental: rental car companies normally replace their fleets once a year, releasing a flood of late-model cars to the secondary market. Like the big financial institutions that underwrite car leases, rental companies also rely on auto auctions to sell off their used inventory. These vehicles tend to be well maintained and driven for only one year. Mileage tends to accumulate quickly on a rental car. Optional features are limited to an A/C and automatic transmission, but these cars are otherwise as close to the base model as they can get. Usage of rental cars is rough; it is safe to assume that during that first year each rental car will be driven by a normal distribution of all types of drivers in all kinds of conditions.
Company/fleet cars: companies of varying sizes own or lease cars, trucks or vans that they typically keep for two or more years, although it is not uncommon to see current year models sold at the auctions. Adequate maintenance and large volumes of similar vehicles are typical characteristics. Like rentals, these fleet vehicles may not have many optional features and may gey exploit on a daily basis. Unlike rentals, usage of company cars varies greatly from the luxury sedans driven carefully on occasion to delivery trucks that regularly mounts curbs and gets abused in city traffic.
Repossessed: vehicles can be voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed by financial institutions for several reasons, including late payments, undisclosed past credit issues, or failure to maintain full coverage insurance. Auto auctions are the most common method of disposing of repossessed vehicles. Repossessed vehicles can feasibly sell for less because the financial institution disposing of them only seeks to offset its losses (also restricted by federal regulations). The condition of such cars may be compromised by lack of maintenance. There is also the potential for sabotage from ill-meaning previous users (e.g., extensive keying or destruction of the interior).
Trade-in: dealer inventory that is aging or does not meet their market positioning (e.g., an old car that was traded in for a new one at a different brand of franchised dealership). Traded-in cars sometimes have after market modifications that may affect their marketability. The overall condition of vehicles also varies. Some vehicles may be much older and out of warranty.
Salvage: vehicles that have been in accidents, floods, fires, or recovered thefts that have been purchased by insurance companies. The insurance companies sell these vehicles to dealers or body shops who will fix them and resell them, or to auto recyclers who will part out the remaining parts of the vehicle that have not been damaged.
Among these types of vehicles, there are quality cars ready to market. Late models with remaining factory warranty are not uncommon. The law requires listing dealers to disclose bigger mechanical problems, which may void the manufacturer's warranty and classify the vehicle as junk, salvage, lemon/consumer buy-back, etc. There are special auctions for these types of vehicles (salvage, rebuilt, or junk vehicles), sold mostly by insurance companies. Other types of auctions specialize in the sale of police or government cars; some of those allow public access.
Pricing
Regardless of their source, vehicles are sent to auction with the main purpose to be sold quickly and hassle-free, and this usually happens at prices that dealers can easily recoup with a small profit from a resale. Contrary to popular belief, cars seldom sell for unreasonably low prices at dealer auctions. This may happen if there are not enough interested bidders or if the vehicle is exceptionally unattractive and should not be taken for granted. Many sellers put reserve prices on their stock specifically to prevent this from happening. The reserve price is not disclosed publicly and a “winning” auction bid is only considered a sale if the reserve price is met. Sellers have the option to re-list vehicles that did not sell at a particular auction.
Condition
As with any used vehicle, overall vehicle condition varies greatly. Many aspects of a vehicle's appearance may suffer in the term of everyday use and result in any of the following damages: stained or otherwise used upholstery, scratched bumpers, dings on the doors, chipped hood, dented quarter panels. Most of these can be fixed with touch-up paint and/or a dent removing kit. Scraped wheels and worn tires may cost more to repair or replace.
Inspection
Pre-sale vehicle inspection or test-driving is allowed at some auctions. Some auction locations inspect and prepare the cars for sale if the listing dealer so chooses (at a premium). More extensive reconditioning is also available. Many auctions offer (for a fee) post-sale inspections for qualifying vehicles that can determine mechanical or frame damage issues and allow the buying dealer a window of opportunity to back out of the purchase. On the other end, sellers can also (for a fee) have their vehicles pre-sale inspected which allows purchasing dealers to buy with confidence that the vehicle passed a pre-sale inspection and is free of mechanical or frame damage issues.
Inventory finance
Most car dealerships do not pay cash for the vehicles they buy at auto auctions. They rely on inventory financing, a line of credit extended by a bank or other institution to acquire vehicles. This is known in industry parlance as floorplanning (floor planning) or simply "flooring" vehicle inventory. Specialty finance companies cater to the used car dealer industry.

Live, Vol. Four is the fourth live album from The Avett Brothers. The album and its concert DVD counterpart were released on December 18, 2015. The vinyl edition was released on September 30, 2016. It contains 14 tracks, including four covers and two never-released original songs.
Live, Vol. Four was recorded at the PNC Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina, on December 31, 2014. Many of the tracks feature Valient Himself of the North Carolina band Valient Thorr as Father Time.
Reception
Francesco Marano of Zumic gave the album a positive review, writing that "...you can hear, and almost feel, the band's energy through the night" of the 2014 New Year's Eve concert. Marcy Donelson of Allmusic gives a more mixed review, that although "over-sung and over-played... their performance has the uplifting infectiousness of a gospel choir."

Ypsolopha maculatella is a moth of the family Ypsolophidae. It is known from the United States, including Arizona and California.
The wingspan is about 20–22 mm.
The antennae are white, sharply annulated with dark brown except on the basal fourth. The labial palpi are white. The face is also white and the head and thorax are ochreous white. The forewings are ochreous white, while the basal half of the costal edge is ochreous fuscous. From the base runs a broad, dark, ochreous fuscous band outwards below the fold, touching the dorsal edge and then curving upwards to the fold. At the end of the cell is a large, oblong, pronounced, dark fuscous spot, produced into a still larger paler ochreous patch, which covers most of the apical third of the wing and emits three dark fingers to the costal edge. The hindwings are paler fuscous. The abdomen is ochreous white and the legs are white, mottled with black exteriorly.

The 1000 km of Castellet is a Blancpain Endurance Series sports car race held at Circuit Paul Ricard in Le Castellet, France. The race began in 1970 as a round of the European 2-Litre Sportscar Championship, and World Sportscar Championship rounds were held in 1974 and 1977. The race was a French national championship race in the 1980s. It was revived in 1998 by the International Sports Racing Series and again in 2010 by the Le Mans Series as an 8-hour race. In 2015, the event returned to its 1000 km format making it only the second time to use that distance since 1974.
Depending on the class-type and the year run, the race has been run as a 2 hour, 2.5 hour, 3 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours or 8-hour event, or as a 200 mile, 225 km, 500 km or 1,000 km eventas shown in the race results in the tables below.

Life
Barbour was born on 7 January 1856 in Edinburgh, the youngest son of Margaret Fraser Sandeman and George Freeland Barbour of Bonskeid (1810-1887), a Director of the North British Railway.
They graduated from the University of Edinburgh with an MA and BSc in natural sciences, continuing at the University to study medicine. They graduated with an MD in 1884, having won a gold medal for their thesis On Spinal Deformity in relation to Obstetrics.
They were President of the Royal College of Physicians in Edinburgh 1914 to 1916.
In later life they are listed as living at 4 Charlotte Square, an elite Edinburgh address.
They died in Edinburgh and was buried in Dean Cemetery on the lower concealed south terrace.

Isochorismate synthase ( ) is an isomerase enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of vitamin K2 (menaquinone) in Escherichia coli.
Reaction
Isochorismate synthase, belongs to the isomerase enzyme family. More specifically it is classified as an intramolecular transferase because it transfers the hydroxy group of chorismate between carbons.
Isochorismate synthase catalyzes the irreversible conversion of chorismate to isochorismate:
Isochorismate synthase is most active at 37 °C and at a pH between 7.5 and 8. It requires Mg2+ as a cofactor, in a concentration between 100 μM and 1 mM. Inhibitors of isochorismate synthase include:
(4R,5R)-4-hydroxy-5-(1-carboxyvinyloxy)-cyclohex-1-ene carboxylate
(4R,5R)-4-hydroxy-5-carboxymethoxy-cyclohex-1-enecarboxylate
(4R,5R)-5-(2-carboxy-allyloxy)-4-hydroxy-cyclohex-1-enecarboxylate
(4R,5R,6S)-6-ammonio-5-[(1-carboxylatoethenyl)oxy]-4-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylate
(4R,5R,7R)-5-(1-carboxy-ethoxy)-4-hydroxy-cyclohex-1-enecarboxylate
(4R,5R,7S)-5-(1-carboxy-ethoxy)-4-hydroxy-cyclohex-1-enecarboxylate
(4R,5S,6S)-4-ammonio-5-[(1-carboxylatoethenyl)oxy]-6-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylate
(4R,5S,6S)-5-[(1-carboxylatoethenyl)oxy]-4,6-dihydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylate

Nomenclature
The systematic name of this enzyme is isochorismate hydroxymutase, and the common name is isochorismate synthase. Other names for this enzyme include:
Isochorismate mutase
Menaquinone-specific isochorismate synthase
MenF
Pathways
MenF is a gene that codes for the isochorismate synthase found in the menaquinone pathway in Escherichia coli, not to be mistaken for the entC gene that codes for the isochorismate synthase found in the enterobactin pathway in Escherichia coli. This enzyme catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of salicylic acid in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Isochorismate synthase has several other homologs that are found in other organisms. These include:

Warhammer Historical Wargames, also known as Warhammer Historical, was the publisher of Warhammer Ancient Battles and other game systems. It was an imprint from the BL Publishing division of Games Workshop. From a leaked email from Rob Broom, who was the director of Warhammer Historical, it appears that Warhammer Historical is now a property of Forge World and their position has become redundant. In November 2010, it was reported that Games Workshop had dissolved the Warhammer Historical corporate structure.
On 25 May 2012, Games Workshop closed Warhammer Historical as a publishing and distribution arm of the company. These games are no longer available to purchase new, and presumably, production of any new systems has also ceased.

The second season of Degrassi Junior High, a Canadian teen drama television series, aired in Canada from January 4, 1988 to April 18, 1988, consisting of thirteen episodes. The series follows the lives of a group of seventh and eighth grade school children attending the titular school as they face various issues and challenges such as child abuse, homophobia, teenage pregnancy, and body image.
The second season aired on Mondays at 8:30.p.m on CBC Television, in prime time. Re-runs of the first season were slotted an hour earlier by CBC's programming chief Ivan Fecan, who hailed the series, before being moved to 8:30.p.m in the leadup to the second season's debut. In the United States, the first two seasons of the series were aired together as one twenty-six episode seasons on PBS. The season was released to DVD by WGBH Boston Home Video on June 7, 2005 in the United States, and by Force Entertainment on October 1, 2005 in Australia.
Production
Following the show's move to prime time, Degrassi Junior High had amassed over a million weekly viewers. Kit Hood and Linda Schuyler decided to continue many of the plotlines from the previous season, while balancing them with more lighthearted plots. Several changes were made for the second season. In one instance, actor Neil Hope, who played Derek "Wheels" Wheeler, began wearing glasses after suffering severe headaches on set, in which their character followed suit. Actress Sarah Charlesworth, who played Suzie Rivera, aimed to leave to concentrate on school.
The premiere episode "Eggbert", centering around pregnant student Christine "Spike" Nelson (Amanda Stepto) and their boyfriend Shane McKay (Bill Parrott) taking care of an egg as if it were a baby, was inspired by an experiment conducted in schools across Toronto to teach children about responsibility.

Politz Day School of Cherry Hill is a private modern orthodox Jewish day school in Cherry Hill, New Jersey which includes the Caskey Elementary School and Konig Middle School. The school shares a common campus with Congregation Sons of Israel in Cherry Hill.
Politz offers preschool (for children as young as eighteen months) through eighth grade with the mission that students learn in an environment combining the abundance of the Jewish religion with traditional secular education. The school serves families living in Cherry Hill, South Jersey, northern Delaware, and Philadelphia including the Main Line, Center City, and the Northeast. Rabbi Chaim Greenwald was named Head of School ahead of the 2021–2022 academic year.
History
Camden had a community Jewish Day School founded by Congregation Sons of Israel's Rabbi Naftoly Riff and Congregation Beth El's Rabbi Harry Kellman. This school closed in the 1950s. Orthodox families in South Jersey sent their children to school in Philadelphia in the 1960s and Cherry Hill was a growing community.
Rabbi Bernard Rothman founded Politz in Camden in 1968 with a small preschool. In 1969 it moved into a house on Cooper Landing Road in Cherry Hill which served as a Cherry Hill branch of Congregation Sons of Israel. Sons of Israel itself moved from Camden to Cherry Hill in 1971.
Politz opened its elementary school in 1984 and added a middle school to eighth grade in 1994. The school grew from 25 students in 1987 to 100 students in 1997, and Politz raised $2.5 million to expand its classroom building.
Sons of Israel built an addition to its building in 2003 into which Politz moved in 2004. Politz began construction in October 2019 on a 7,500 square foot addition to its existing building to include additional classrooms, STEAM lab, kitchen, and gymnasium.
Rabbi Avraham Glustein served as Head of School from 1996 through 2021.

The International Order of the Rainbow for Girls (IORG) is a Masonic youth service organization that teaches leadership training through community service. Young women (ages 11–20) learn about the value of charity and service through their work and involvement with their annual local and Grand (state or country) service projects.
History
The order came into existence in 1922,
when the Reverend W. Mark Sexson, a Freemason, was asked to make an address before South McAlester Chapter #149, Order of the Eastern Star, in McAlester, Oklahoma. As the Order of DeMolay had come under their close study during their Masonic activities, they suggested that a similar order for young women would be beneficial. The first Initiation consisted of a class of 171 young women on April 6, 1922, in the auditorium of the Scottish Rite Temple in McAlester, Oklahoma. The original name was "Order of the Rainbow for Girls".
Officers
Members can hold many different offices (also called Stations) in the local Assembly. Each requires some memory work and all but two serves for one term (four or six months out of the year, depending on Assembly bylaws). Some offices are elected by the other members in the assembly. These offices normally include Faith, Hope, Charity, Worthy Associate Advisor, and Worthy Advisor. There are also two offices that are elected in January but serve a full year which are Treasurer and Recorder. The other offices are appointed by the Worthy Advisor (President) and Mother Advisor. All offices include:
Worthy Advisor (WA) Presides at meetings and plans activities for their term like a President: the highest office in an Assembly
Worthy Associate Advisor (WAA) Duties similar to a Vice President. Presides over a meeting in the absence of the Worthy Advisor
Charity Teaches about charitable deeds
Hope Teaches that hope is always there for us
Faith Teaches that faith is our constant companion.  They are the officer who guides new candidates throughout an initiation ceremony
Recorder Records minutes and handles correspondence
Treasurer Handles money and bills and compiles reports about the balances of the Assembly's various money accounts
Chaplain Leads in prayers
Drill Leader Leads the officers in their floor work and leads guests around the Assembly room
Seven Bow Stations Teach lessons about the colors of the rainbow and their corresponding virtues:
Love (Red) In all its forms
Religion (Orange) The importance of religion in all its forms (based on love and forgiveness)
Nature (Yellow) Its importance in your daily life
Immortality (Green) The understanding of death is a part of life
Fidelity (Blue) Emphasis on being honest and reliable
Patriotism (Indigo) Encouraging citizenship to your country
Service (Violet) Service to others which bind all the colors together
Confidential Observer Guards the inner doors of the assembly room, respectively
Outer Observers Guards the outer doors of the assembly room, respectively
Musician and Choir Director Provide music for the meetings
Some Assemblies and Grand Assemblies have other officers not specified in the ritual, such as Historian, Editor, Assistant Grand Editor, Circulation Manager, Orator (or Lecturer), Bible Bearer, Goodwill Ambassador, American Flag Bearer, State Flag Bearer, Christian Flag Bearer, Rainbow Flag Bearer, and Assembly Banner Bearer.
It is an unwritten law that each of the line officers (Faith, Hope, Charity, and Worthy Associate Advisor) advances to the next highest office, culminating in their term as Worthy Advisor. However, this is not a guarantee.
Advisors
The local assembly is governed by an Advisory Board of seven to fifteen adults consisting of Master Masons, members of Order of the Eastern Star, members of the Order of Amaranth, Majority Members, and family members of active members. Some advisory boards are appointed by a sponsoring body, while others are a "club" style and are not sponsored. Elected offices of an advisory board are Chairperson, Mother Advisor, Secretary, and Treasurer. The Mother Advisor is the liaison between the members and the advisory board. Almost all of the Assembly work should be done by the members, with the advisors in support roles only. A District Deputy is appointed by the Supreme Inspector/Deputy as an aide to the local assemblies. The authority of the District Deputy is limited to inspecting the ceremonial work of the assembly and providing guidance at the request of the Advisory Board or Supreme Inspector/Deputy. The District Deputy is not a member of the Advisory Board but is a resource and a reference as well as the first person the Mother Advisor and Board Chair would go to for help and questions.
High Honors
The appointing of Grand Officers varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally, to be appointed or elected to a Grand Floor Office, a member must be a Past or Present Worthy Advisor in their assembly. Grand Representatives may also be PWAs, but it is not mandatory. Other offices include: Grand Choir, Grand Assistant Outer Observer/Grand Confidential Observer Helper, Personal Page, and Grand Page at Large. Each Jurisdiction has their own traditions.
The Grand Cross of Color is the highest award given to a member or adult leader for outstanding service. Recipients of the award (Masters of the Grand Cross of Color) are expected to meet once per year for a special service. In order for designates to be nominated, the assembly must initiate 3 new members within a calendar year. For every 3 new members, one member may be chosen to receive the Grand Cross of Color for service rendered above and beyond what is expected for Rainbow. The Masters of the Grand Cross of Color meet with the Advisory Board to decide which member(s) to nominate as a designee for the Grand Cross of Color. The Grand Cross of Color may also be awarded to adults that serve the assembly, but there may be no more adults than young women that are nominated. In addition, adult sponsors without Masonic affiliation are awarded the Service to Rainbow in place of the Grand Cross of Color.
Supreme Assembly
The governing body of Rainbow is the House of Gold. New members are elected by current members. The House of Gold consists of the Supreme Officers (paralleling a local Assembly), Supreme Inspectors (chief advisor for a jurisdiction), and several others making up a total of 50.
Presiding Supreme Inspectors may retire their duties at any time, unless they are elected to the Supreme line, at which time they must find a successor by the time they reach Supreme Worthy Associate Advisor. The current Supreme Inspector chooses the person whom they believe can best associate with the members of their jurisdiction. That person will become the next Supreme Deputy. It isn't until Supreme Deputies are elected into the House of Gold that they become Supreme Inspectors. There are 50 seats in the House of Gold, and they are lifetime appointments. A Supreme Deputy is eligible for recommendation into the House of Gold after their 3rd Supreme Assembly after being installed as Supreme Deputy (the Supreme at which they are installed does NOT count).
Locations
The International Order of the Rainbow for Girls has Assemblies in 46 states in the United States as well as in several other countries. The states that do not currently have Assemblies are Delaware, Minnesota, Utah, and Wyoming.
The countries outside the United States that have assemblies are Aruba, Australia (in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia), Bolivia, Brazil (in Parana, São Paulo, Distrito Federal, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso do Sul, Tocantins, Pará, Espírito Santo and Santa Catarina [ Biguaçu ]), Canada (in Ontario, and [New Brunswick)], Paraguay (in Asuncion, Encarnación, Ciudad del Este and Concepción), the Philippines, Italy, Mexico, and Romania. Rainbow has had assemblies in the following countries, mostly due to American military presence: Cuba, Germany, France, Panama and Vietnam.
Its headquarters are at the International Temple in McAlester, Oklahoma built in 1950-1951 for the Order's use.
Membership
Being related to a Master Mason or member of Eastern Star no longer is a requirement for Rainbow membership. Interested young women must submit an application and associated fee to an Assembly. The members of that Assembly will meet with the young woman to answer any questions they or their parents/guardians may have and to make sure they are a proper candidate to receive the degrees. A proper candidate, by guidelines of the order is a girl within the appropriate age range who believes in the existence of a Supreme Being, does not cohabitate with a significant other, has had no children, is not pregnant, has never been married, and has the permission of their parents/guardians to become a member. Once the application is accepted, the assembly will vote on accepting the candidate into the Assembly. Membership then starts with an Initiation Ceremony.
Members are expected to serve their community, be law-abiding, acknowledge the authority of the Supreme Assembly, and show loyalty to the other members, among other things. In 2000, the rules for Eastern Star were changed so that majority members of Rainbow were eligible for membership in that Order. For girls between ages 6 and 10, some jurisdictions have a "Pledge" program for prospective members, so that they can become familiar with Rainbow ceremonies and activities.
Majority Membership is reached in two ways. A young woman receives age majority when they reach their 20th birthday, or marriage majority if they marry before age 20. Also, depending on the jurisdiction, young women are given the choice of extending their membership until they reach the age of 21. For this to be granted, the young woman must write a letter expressing their interest in extending their active service and present it to their Supreme Deputy/Inspector.

The Egyptian Civil Code is the primary source of civil law for Egypt.
The first version of Egyptian Civil Code was written in 1949 containing 1149 articles. The prime author of the 1949 code was the jurist Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri, who received assistance from Dean Edouard Lambert of the University of Lille. Perhaps due to Lambert's influence, the 1949 code followed the French civil law model. The code focuses on the regulation of business and commerce, and does not include any provisions regarding family law. El-Sanhuri purposely left out family law and succession to set it apart from the Turkish civil code.
Article 1 of the code provides that, “in the absence of any applicable legislation, the judge shall decide according to the custom and failing the custom, according to the principles of Islamic Law. In the absence of these principles, the judge shall have recourse to natural law and the rules of equity.” Despite this invocation of Islamic law, one commentator has argued that 1949 code reflected a "hodgepodge of socialist doctrine and sociological jurisprudence."
The Egyptian Civil Code has been the source of law and inspiration for numerous other Middle Eastern jurisdictions, including pre-dictatorship kingdoms of Libya and Iraq (both drafted by El-Sanhuri themselves and a team of native jurists under their guidance), in addition to Jordan (completed in 1976, after their death) Bahrain (2001), as well as Qatar (1971) (these last two merely inspired by their notions), and the commercial code of Kuwait (drafted by El-Sanhuri). When Sudan drafted its own civil code in 1970, it was in large part copied from the Egyptian Civil Code with slight modifications. Today, all Mashriq Arab nations possessing modern civil codes, with the exception of Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Oman, are based fully or partly on the Egyptian Civil Code.
Historical background
Egypt began legal reform in 1875 when it gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in judicial and legal matters, which led to the establishment of the Mixed Courts to deal with foreigners and national courts. This necessitated a need for a set of laws that had secular influence. When Egypt obtained the needed international agreement for the union of its legal system in 1937, it started to draw up a new series of comprehensive codes. Most of this effort was overseen by the Egyptian jurist Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri. The code was originally drafted in 1942, but went through several revisions before its passage in 1949.
Its author, Al-Sanhuri, stayed loyal to their vision of having judges rule in accordance with the code itself before considering using Shari'a, which had not been codified for a long time. For the first time in the modern history of the Arab Middle East, the Shari'a would be used to back up a secular document. With the civil code as the principal source of law, all Shari'a courts were abolished. The writing of the civil code was an attempt on the part of Al-Sanhuri to modernize Islamic law by adopting ideas from western civil law, a concept greatly supported by the elite members of Egyptian society. Westernization meant confining certain Islamic law to mostly matters dealing with personal status such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance.
British colonization led to some shift to the common law, but the common law had little long-term impact on the legal systems of many countries that fell under British rule where there was an existing codified system. Thus civil law, mostly of French origins, now prevails throughout the Middle East, and the occasional remnants of common law are likely not to survive (with the exception of Israeli law which remains largely based on common law as it pertains to non-private matters). As a result, the modern legal systems of Middle Eastern countries share the basic features of French law, such as relying on complete and logical statements of the law in codes as official sources of law, keeping a sharp division between public and private law and between commercial and private law.

Lee Yeong-gwang (born 1965) is a South Korean poet and educator. They were born in 1965 in Gyeongsangbuk-do. They graduated from Korea University's graduate school. They have won the 8th Nojak Literature Prize in 2008, the 11th Jihoon Prize (Literature Prize) in 2011, and the 11th Midang Literary Award in the same year.  They are a poet who depicts life's sadness in elaborate language, but does not dwell in despair, and lyrically shows the image of gaining the will for starting life again. They have been a creative writing professor at Korea University since 2015.
Life
Lee Yeong-gwang (born 1965) is a South Korean poet and educator. They were born in 1965 in Uiseong, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and grew up in Andong. According to him, in 1986, when they went to the Sea of Japan with their friend and was drinking, poetry suddenly came out. They began their literary career with publishing 10 poems including “Bingpok” (빙폭 Glacier Fall) in 1988 on Joongang Literary Journal. They graduated from Korea University in English literature (bachelor's), and they earned a doctorate degree from Korea University in Korean literature with a thesis on So Chong-ju. They serialized their writing on newspapers for a long time, and they have also collected the writing they had serialized into Holim tteolim ulim (홀림 떨림 울림 Possession Vibration Reverberation) (Nanam, 2013). They have won the 8th Nojak Literature Prize in 2008, the 11th Jihoon Prize (Literature Prize) in 2011, and the 11th Midang Literary Award in the same year. They have been a creative writing professor in media at Korea University since 2015. They participated in the 2016 Seoul International Writer's Festival.
Writing
In their first poetry collection, Jikseon wi-eseo tteolda (직선 위에서 떨다 Shivering Atop a Straight Line), Lee Yeong-gwang attempted to turn the agony of youth that endures great pain into literature. Their poetry is thick with sadness for old things or ruins. Though this isn't unrelated to their experiences during adolescence, literary critic Hwang Hyeon-san has said that this is “a result of poverty ridden life”. According to him, Lee Yeong-gwang feels that today's world lacks something, and that they are conscious of how they are left for themselves in this ‘age of poverty'. The poet, though they consider the world as an uncertain place, attempts to overcome that and find something certain. In the title piece of the collection, “Jikseon wi-eseo tteolda” (직선 위에서 떨다 Shivering Atop a Straight Line) they write that they saw “a road so decisive that it saw right through me”, and that road is “supporting with all its body a scratched life”. This shows that the poet is attempting to find that definite ‘road'.
In their second poetry collection, Geuneulgwa sagwida (그늘과 사귀다 Making Friends with the Shade), their understanding of death is evident. They examine death, and thereby throws questions on life. They describe funerals and memorial rituals in detail, studying how the lives of the dead and the living overlap. Through this, the poet shows that within the process of funeral rites and the symbolic meaning of traditional life, there is an integration of life and death.
The poet's interest on death continued toward the third poetry collection Apeun cheonguk (아픈 천국 The Sick Heaven). However, here their understanding of death became an occasion for the poet to compose their will to live on freely and fully. Their most recent poetry collection Namuneun ganda (나무는 간다 The Tree is Going), their interest in social issues is evident. If their past collection was depicted as an occasion for them to look back on life by the way of ‘death', Namuneun ganda (나무는 간다 The Tree is Going) is a story of those that have died wrongly due to social injustice. With their unique sensibility, they face the cruel reality that gives rise to unjust deaths, and fiercely rebukes society filled with contradiction. Despite that, Lee Yeong-gwang's poetry is on another level than simple social criticism. That is because by directly looking at death, they express faith for nurturing new hope, placing their work at a higher level of poetry.

In arms sales and black market activities, non-state transfers are transactions of weapons or other goods - material or non-material - where neither party involved is a government. This is in contrast to the usual practice of arms sales, where a government purchases arms from another government or from private industry. This is also in contrast to situations where a government may provide arms to a non-state actor, such as a separatist movement or terrorists.
Examples of non-state transfers could include theft from the military of a sovereign state, sale by a private individual of government goods which do not legally belong to him, and a variety of other black market activities.
Many attempts at international arms control, such as the Chemical Weapons Convention, Biological Weapons Convention and the Australia Group, are premised on the notion that one or both parties involved will be state actors. Thus, non-state transfers represent a generally unaddressed area of concern regarding weapons proliferation.

A Ninki Nanka is a legendary creature in West African folklore. Descriptions of the creature vary, but most contend that the animal is reptilian and possibly dragon-like.
According to tradition, the Ninki Nanka lives in the swamps of West Africa. The animal is said to be extremely large and very dangerous. It is said that when children get too confident and feel they can disobey their parents and go into the swamp they will be taken by the Ninki Nanka. This creature's tales were never recorded in any sort of non-modern text but the story of it has spread from tribe to tribe all over Africa. There is a song called "Ninki Nanka" on the album Casamance au clair de lune (1984) by the Senegalese music group Touré Kunda.
A group of "dragon hunters" from the Centre for Fortean Zoology (CFZ) went to the Gambia in the summer of 2006 to investigate the Ninki Nanka and take testimony from those who have claimed to have seen the mythical creature. One interviewee who claimed to have had an encounter with a Ninki Nanka said it looked similar to an image of a Chinese dragon. The expedition, known as the "J. T. Downes Memorial Gambia Expedition 2006", received a fair amount of media attention, including coverage in a BBC Online article.
Popular culture
Ninki Nanka appeared in the 2016 fantasy novel, Kaytch by Joseph J. Grant.
Ninki Nanka are featured in the 2021 fantasy novel, Skin of the Sea by Natasha Bowen.

Contemporary account
According to the 1830 edition of the Encyclopedia Americana, the population was composed of Berbers, black Africans and Arabs.
One late 18th century source (William Carey, "An Enquiry Into the Obligation of Christians to Use Means for the Conversion of the Heathens") gave the dimensions of Biledulgerid as 2,500 miles in length and 350 miles in breadth with a population of 3.5 million.

Tristão de Bragança Cunha (2 April 1891 – 26 September 1958), alternatively spelled as Tristao de Braganza Cunha, popularly known as T B Cunha was a prominent Indian nationalist and anti-colonial activist from Goa (then part of Portuguese India).  They are popularly known as the "Father of Goan nationalism", and was the organiser of the first movement to end Portuguese rule in Goa.
Early life and education
Cunha was born on 2 April 1891 in the village Chandor in Goa. They hailed from Cuelim, Cansaulim. They completed their school education in Panjim and then went to Pondicherry to French College for their B.A. and then to Paris. There they studied at the Sorbonne University and obtained a degree in electrical engineering. In Paris, Cunha entered the circle of Romain Rolland and helped publicise the Indian independence movement generally, and the case of Portuguese India in particular, in the French-language press.
Role in Goa liberation movement (1926–1954)
Cunha returned to Goa in 1926 and they set up the Comissão do Congresso de Goa (Goa Congress Committee) in Goa in 1928 to organise the Goan intelligentsia against Portuguese colonial rule. Pressured by Portuguese authorities, Cunha transferred operations to Bombay and in 1938, affiliated their organisation with the Indian National Congress. They continued publicising the Goan case in a stream of articles and books, denouncing Portuguese rule. Among their publications were booklets Four A Hundred Years of Foreign Rule and The Denationalisation of Goans (1944). Cunha was an advocate of Goan identification, political as well as cultural, with greater India.
In 1946, Cunha could not be contacted in those good old days. Communication was poor, to say the least. T B Cunha came to know about the "unrest" in Margao and came to the city the next day. Ram Manohar Lohia had addressed what was arguably the first and largest mass gathering yet, setting in motion the Goa liberation movement on the previous day. Cunha was arrested by the Portuguese authorities. They were kept in dark damp cell at Fort Aguada. They were the first civilian to be tried by a military tribunal. They were court martialled and sentenced to eight years imprisonment. They were deported to the Peniche Fortress in Portugal.
After their release from Portugal in 1954, Cunha returned to Bombay. Cunha formed and headed the Goa Action Committee, to help co-ordinate the numerous Goan organisations that had emerged by this time. They published a newspaper called "Free Goa".
Death
They died on 26 September 1958, Loknayak Jaiprakash Narayan was one of the pallbearers. The Government of India issued a postage stamp in their honour.
Legacy
The World Peace Council at Stockholm in 1959 posthumously awarded T. B. Cunha a gold medal for their contribution to the cause of "Peace and Friendship among People."
Cunha's mortal remains are housed in an urn at a memorial located in Panaji's Azad Maidan. A prominent road in the city of Panaji is named as "T. B. Cunha Road". A statue of Cunha has been installed in their ancestral village of Cuelim, Cansaulim. A school in Margao and a government higher secondary school in Panaji are also named in Cunha's honour. The campus in Panaji's Altinho which houses the Goa College of Architecture and the Goa College of Music, is named as "Dr. T. B. Cunha Educational Complex".
A sports' complex in Cansaulim, Cuelim is named after him, and their portrait was unveiled in the Indian Parliament in 2011 to commemorate the golden jubilee of Goa's accession to India.
The book The Life & Times of T. B. Cunha by Nishta Desai was published in 2015.

Grimsbyoceras is a nautiloid genus included in the Oncocerida order of the family Acleistoceratidae that lived during the Middle Devonian. They have been found in North America (Illinois) and central Europe.
Grimsbyoceras, named by Foerste in 1926, has a depressed, breviconic shell, with an elliptical transverse aperture, without a hyponomic sinus, and a small, subventral siphuncle. The phragmocone is rapidly expanding and strongly exogastric. The body chamber is attached at knee-like bends on the ventral and lateral sides.
Acleistoceras and Poteriocerina are similar acleistoceratids from the Middle Devonian, differing primarily in internal detail.

The Santa Fe Railway Monzanola Depot, also known as Manzanola station, was an Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in Manzanola, Colorado. Now used as a town hall, the property has been on the National Register of Historic Places since April 28, 2004.
History
The single track railroad line to Pueblo, Colorado was completed by the Santa Fe Railway in 1876. Although the track existed, the depot wasn't built until 1913. The station first opened with both freight and passenger services. The depot was finally closed by the railroad in 1973. The station remained vacant until, in 1976, it was donated to the city of Manzanola. In 1991, a senior center opened in the former waiting room area.
Restoration
Most of the building has been in a steady decline since the donation to the town in 1976. Until 2007, the only part of the station in use was the east side, with a small senior center. With the grand opening in November 2007, the new depot houses the town hall and police department. The construction was done by White Construction Group.

The 2013 United States Senate special election in Massachusetts was held on June 25, 2013, in order to fill the Massachusetts Class 2 United States Senate seats for the remainder of the term ending January 3, 2015.
The vacancy that prompted the special election was created by the resignation of Senator John Kerry, in order to become U.S. Secretary of State. On January 30, 2013, Governor Deval Patrick chose their former chief of staff, Mo Cowan, to serve as interim U.S. Senator. Cowan declined to participate in the election. A party primary election was held on April 30, to determinate the nominees of each party for the general election. The Massachusetts Democrats nominated U.S. Representative Ed Markey, while the Massachusetts Republicans nominated Gabriel E. Gomez, a business person and former Navy SEAL.
The race drew remarks from the media, because of its potential similarity to the 2010 special election, when Republican state senator Scott Brown upset the Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley. However, Gomez trailed Markey in every opinion poll taken, and Markey defeated them by a 10.2 percentage point margin, despite low turnout.
Background
The incumbent senator, John Kerry (Democratic), was nominated to serve as U.S. Secretary of State by President Barack Obama on December 21, 2012. They were confirmed by the Senate on January 29, 2013, and in a letter to Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, Kerry announced their resignation from the Senate, effective February 1. Kerry was sworn in as secretary of state on the same day.
Patrick's former chief of staff, Mo Cowan, was appointed to replace Kerry in the Senate on the same day, and immediately ruled themselves out of the special election. The special primary elections took place on April 30. Democratic U.S. Representative Ed Markey and Republican business person Gabriel E. Gomez won their respective primaries.
Democratic primary
U.S. Representatives Ed Markey and Stephen F. Lynch both announced campaigns for the open seat. Markey was perceived as more left-wing than Lynch.

Caerleon railway station is a former station serving Caerleon on the east side of the city of Newport, UK and a proposed future station as part of the South Wales Metro.
History
The station was opened by the Pontypool, Caerleon and Newport Railway on 21 December 1874. This came after the absorption of the Pontypool company by the Great Western Railway. The station closed to passengers on 30 April 1962 and to all traffic on 29 November 1965.
The site is now mixed use business premises including a gym, MOT centre and Veterinary Clinic.
Proposed reopening
The Newport City Council unitary development plan and Sewta rail strategy in 2006 set out plans for the station to be re-opened. Assessments by Capita Symonds in 2010 evaluated the cost of the project as £14.1m, and highlighted it would be of particular importance given the popular restaurant and pub environment in the town, as well as the 70,000 yearly visitors to the Roman tourist attractions nearby. Caerleon is particularly suited to public transport improvements as it has long had poor air quality. It has been subject to a Newport City Council air quality management area study since January 2018 due to the low standard of air quality in the town centre.
The Welsh Government has commissioned Arup to review the Caerleon Station Grip 3 Report land around the site has been safeguarded by Newport City Council for future reopening but in the near term the station has been neglected in favour of other reopenings predominantly in the Cardiff area.
Nevertheless, Newport City Council has discussed preliminary matters such as the provision of approximately half a hectare for car parking, subject to exact provision being agreed with Welsh Government.
The rail operator Transport for Wales announced in 2018 that Caerleon is a target for reopening as part of the South Wales Metro project. It would join similar proposed facilities at Magor, Cardiff Parkway, and Llanwern.
Proposals to reopen Caerleon station were strengthened following the decision by First Minister Mark Drakeford in 2019 to reject the M4 relief road, which now allows up to £1.4bn to be allocated through the Welsh Government's borrowing facility for improving infrastructure in and around the south east Wales M4.

Zlatan () is a male given name of Slavic origin meaning Golden. The name is common amongst all South Slavic countries, namely in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia and Serbia. The name is found in particularly high frequencies in Bosnia because it is considered ethnically neutral amongst the three dominant Bosnian ethnicities: Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats. The name is derived from the South Slavic word zlato - from the Old Slavic root [wikt:zolto|zolto] (gold).

Margherita Cecilia Brigida Lucia Maria Albanesi (8 October 1899—9 December 1923) was a British stage and film actor.
Life and career
They were born in London on 8 October 1899. Them father was Italian-born Carlo Albanesi (1856-1926), a pianist and teacher at Royal Academy of Music, while their mother was Effie Adelaide Rowlands, a writer who published over 100 romance novels. They attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and appeared on the stage in The School for Scandal, Mr. Todd's Experiment and A Pair of Spectacles. They appeared in small film roles in The Romance of Old Bill, Darby and Joan and Mr. Wu.
They enjoyed a successful theatre career, starring in plays such as Galsworthy's The First and the Last, opposite Owen Nares. They were soon being hailed by critics as one of the brightest prospects in British acting.
Death
After making just six films, Albanesi died at the age of 24 in Broadstairs, Kent, on 9 December 1923, of intestinal obstruction and laparotomy, allegedly as a result of an illegal abortion. They were buried in St Pancras Cemetery in central London.
Albanesi had a relationship with the theatre and film producer Basil Dean who continued to be obsessed with them after their death. Dean was first attracted to their wife the actor Victoria Hopper because of their physical resemblance to Albanesi and cast them in a number of their productions. Their final film as a director 21 Days was based on a play, The First and the Last on which they had worked with Albanesi.
Dean commissioned Eric Gill to create a memorial plaque to Albanesi, which can be seen in the foyer of the St Martin's Theatre, West Street, London. Them friend Noël Coward dedicated the first published text of their play The Rat Trap to the "dear memory of Meggie Albanesi" in 1924.

The World's Greatest Tag Team was an American professional wrestling tag team, which also used the name Wrestling's Greatest Tag Team. The team consisted of Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin. Originally formed in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), they started out captained by Kurt Angle, during which time they were known as Team Angle. They also wrestled for several other independent promotions.
Haas and Benjamin made their debut on the SmackDown! brand in December 2002, and won the WWE Tag Team Championship in February 2003. After losing the championship in May, Haas and Benjamin were fired from Team Angle, and changed their name to The Best Damn Tag Team Period, before settling on The World's Greatest Tag Team. They won the championship back in July, and their second reign lasted for two months. They continued to compete on SmackDown!, until March 2004, when Benjamin was moved to the Raw brand as part of the Draft Lottery.
The team reformed in December 2006 on the Raw brand, and competed against numerous teams, although they were unsuccessful in winning the World Tag Team Championship. The team was split again in November 2007, when Benjamin moved to the ECW brand, but later reformed briefly back on SmackDown in May 2009. In 2010, the team reformed on the independent circuit, and began competing regularly for Ring of Honor (ROH), where they are former two-time ROH World Tag Team Champions.
History
World Wrestling Entertainment
Initial run (2002–2004)
They formed on October 22, 2002 in a dark match on WWE Velocity as they lost to Bill DeMott and Val Venis. For a couple of months they worked their way up by competing in house shows. The tag team made their television debut on the December 26, 2002 edition of WWE's SmackDown!. Paul Heyman introduced Benjamin and Haas under the name Team Angle as a "gift" to their top client Kurt Angle. Team Angle quickly involved themselves in a rivalry with Chris Benoit and Edge, defeating them on January 30, 2003 to become the number one contenders for the WWE Tag Team Championship.
The following week, on February 6, they won the WWE Tag Team Championship by defeating Los Guerreros. They continued their rivalry with Benoit, facing them and Brock Lesnar at No Way Out in a handicap match, where they teamed with their mentor Angle in a losing effort. After a successful title defense at WrestleMania XIX against Los Guerreros and the team of Chris Benoit and Rhyno, Team Angle lost the championship to Eddie Guerrero and their new partner Tajiri at Judgment Day on May 18 in a ladder match. Shortly afterwards, on June 12, Angle confronted Benjamin and Haas about the losing streak they had been in for a couple of weeks, and, after they blamed them for losing the Tag Team Championship and began to question their leadership, they fired them both from Team Angle. For a few weeks they wrestled against Angle, both in singles matches and in tag team matches.
Soon after the breakup, Benjamin and Haas referred to themselves as The Best Damn Tag Team Period and then The Self-Proclaimed World's Greatest Tag Team, or The World's Greatest Tag Team for short. They went on to recapture the WWE Tag Team Championship from Eddie Guerrero and Tajiri on July 3. Following their win, they competed against the teams of Rey Mysterio and Billy Kidman and the APA, before losing the championship to the reformed Los Guerreros team two months later on September 18. After their loss The World's Greatest Tag Team continued competing against Los Guerreros in an attempt to regain the championship, but were unsuccessful.
In early 2004, The World's Greatest Tag Team began a rivalry with The APA, and beat them at the No Way Out pay-per-view. Following their loss, The World's Greatest Tag Team mocked The APA, leading to The APA attacking them. Both the team of Scotty 2 Hotty and Rikishi and the Basham Brothers also got involved in the brawl, leading to a fatal four-way match at WrestleMania XX for the WWE Tag Team Championship. At WrestleMania, Scotty 2 Hotty and Rikishi retained the championship.
Split (2004–2006)
The group stayed together until March 22, 2004 when, during the Draft Lottery, Benjamin was drafted to the Raw brand, breaking up The World's Greatest Tag Team. On the Raw brand Benjamin was quickly added to the WWE Intercontinental Championship picture, first challenging for it at Bad Blood in June 2004 against Randy Orton. They eventually won the championship at Taboo Tuesday in October by defeating Chris Jericho, and held the championship for approximately eight months, eventually losing it to Carlito in June 2005. They held the championship twice more during 2006.
After Benjamin's draft, Haas gained Miss Jackie as a valet and teamed with Rico to win the WWE Tag Team Championship on April 22, 2004. After a brief spell in singles competition, Haas joined forces with Hardcore Holly briefly, before being released from WWE in July 2005. Haas wrestled in the independent circuit for nearly a year, wrestling in Jersey All Pro Wrestling and other independent promotions and as well as New Wrestling Entertainment in Italy before returning to WWE on the Raw brand in April 2006.
Reformation on Raw (2006–2008)
On April 17, 2006, Haas returned to WWE as part of the Raw brand, defeating their former tag team partner, Benjamin, the very same night. On the December 4 episode of Raw, after Benjamin pinned Super Crazy, Haas entered the ring, berated Crazy, and celebrated with a bewildered Benjamin. The next week, Benjamin announced The World's Greatest Tag Team was officially back in a segment with Cryme Tyme. They defeated The Highlanders in a match later that same night. They then started a scripted rivalry with Cryme Tyme, but were largely unsuccessful, including a tag team turmoil match at New Year's Revolution. They finally pinned Cryme Tyme, however, ending their undefeated streak, on the January 29, 2007 episode of Raw.
On April 2, The World's Greatest Tag Team was unsuccessful in defeating the team of Ric Flair and Carlito, but defeated them in a rematch on April 16 when Haas distracted Carlito, allowing Benjamin to gain the win. They won again two weeks later when Carlito turned on Flair, attacking them and allowing The World's Greatest Tag Team to win via countout. They then challenged the Hardy Boyz for the World Tag Team Championship at One-Night Stand in a ladder match, but were unsuccessful.
Following this, The World's Greatest Tag Team began a rivalry with Paul London and Brian Kendrick after losing to the duo in their debut match on Raw. A few weeks later, London defeated Benjamin in a singles match, however, on the July 23 episode of Raw, The World's Greatest Tag Team got a tag team win over London and Kendrick to end the rivalry. For this match they were announced as The (Self-Proclaimed) World's Greatest Tag Team, having been previously using simply The World's Greatest Tag Team since their reformation.
Following this, Benjamin and Haas competed against the teams of Hardcore Holly and Cody Rhodes and Super Crazy and Jim Duggan until November, when the team was disbanded due to Benjamin joining the ECW roster. Benjamin was drafted to the SmackDown brand as part of the 2008 Supplemental Draft.
Sporadic reformations and aftermath (2009)
On April 15, 2009, Haas was drafted to the SmackDown brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft. On the May 8, 2009 episode of SmackDown, Benjamin accompanied Haas to the ring for their match against John Morrison, hinting at a possible reunion. The following week on the May 15 episode of SmackDown, Benjamin and Haas unofficially reunited and competed against John Morrison and CM Punk in a losing effort. At Judgment Day, Haas escorted Benjamin to the ring for their match against Morrison. On June 29, Benjamin was traded back to the ECW brand. On February 28, 2010, WWE announced that Haas had been released from their contract, and two months later, on April 22, WWE announced that Benjamin had also been released, but returned, sans Haas, in 2017.
Ring of Honor (2010–2013)
On August 2, 2010, Ring of Honor announced that Haas and Benjamin would reform as a tag team, at Glory By Honor IX on September 11, 2010, to wrestle the ROH World Tag Team Champions The Kings of Wrestling (Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli). The duo later stated that they would collectively be known as Wrestling's Greatest Tag Team. At Glory By Honor IX Haas and Benjamin were defeated by Hero and Castagnoli in a non–title match. On December 8, 2010, Haas and Benjamin returned to Ohio Valley Wrestling, more than seven years after their previous match for the promotion. In their return match they defeated The Elite (Adam Revolver and Ted McNaler). The following day they took part in their first Ring of Honor Wrestling tapings, defeating the Bravado Brothers (Harlem and Lance). The following day, at the second set of television tapings, Haas and Benjamin defeated the All Night Express of Kenny King and Rhett Titus, before participating in an eight-man tag team match, in which Haas and Benjmain teamed with the Briscoe Brothers against the Kings of Wrestling and the All-Night Xpress. The match ended in a no contest. On December 18 at the Final Battle 2010 pay-per-view, Haas and Benjamin announced that in 2011 they would be wrestling regularly for Ring of Honor. At the following pay-per-view, 9th Anniversary Show, on February 26, 2011, Haas and Benjamin defeated the Briscoe Brothers in the main event of the evening to earn another shot at the Kings of Wrestling and the ROH World Tag Team Championship.
On April 1, at Honor Takes Center Stage Night One, Haas and Benjamin defeated the Kings of Wrestling to win the ROH World Tag Team Championship. On June 26 at Best in the World 2011, Haas and Benjamin successfully defended the ROH World Tag Team Championship in a four-way match against the Briscoe Brothers, the Kings of Wrestling and the All Night Express. On December 23, Haas and Benjamin lost the ROH World Tag Team Championship to the Briscoe Brothers at the Final Battle 2011 pay-per-view, turning heel during the match. On May 12, 2012 at Border Wars, Hass and Benjamin regained the ROH World Tag Team Championship from the Briscoe Brothers. On June 24 at Best in the World 2012, Haas and Benjamin lost the title to Kenny King and Rhett Titus.
Shortly after their loss, Benjamin was suspended in storyline, to explain their absence while wrestling in Japan. Benjamin returned at the Death Before Dishonor X pay-per-view, accompanying Haas and Rhett Titus in a tag team championship match. Following Death Before Dishonor, Haas and Benjamin would continue to feud with Titus and their new tag team partner B. J. Whitmer defeating them at Glory By Honor XI. They defeated them again in a street fight at Final Battle. Benjamin was released from ROH in December 2012. They made one more appearance for ROH on February 2, 2013, when Haas turned on them during an ROH World Tag Team Championship match against the Briscoe Brothers.
Independent circuit (2014-2015)
On November 15, 2014, Jersey All Pro Wrestling's 18th Anniversary Show, Benjamin, Haas, and Angle (collectively known as Team Angle) reunited again. Haas and Benjamin defeated Chris Sabin and Teddy Hart in the main event of the show. On November 21, 2015 they won the Danny Davis Invitational Tag Team Tournament for Ohio Valley Wrestling defeating The Wild Boyz (Bud Dwight and Eddie Diamond).

The Hume School is an 1891 former school building in the Arlington Ridge neighborhood in Arlington County, Virginia. It is the oldest school building in Arlington County. It has been the home of the Arlington Historical Society since 1960.
The building
The Queen Anne-style building was designed by B. Stanley Simmons, a Washington architect. Its design reflects the changing thoughts around the importance of education and larger schools. Frank Hume, a Confederate veteran of the Civil War and local civic leader, sold their property to the county for $250 and donated some additional land for the playground. It was an active public school from 1891 until it closed in 1958. A community campaign ended with the building being deeded to the Arlington Historical Society in 1960. They later purchased additional property behind the building to ensure views toward Washington and prevent development.
The National Park Service listed the building on the National Register of Historic Places on June 18, 1979. The Arlington County Board designated the building to be a local historic district on October 3, 1978.
The Hume School is currently operated as the Arlington Historical Museum by the Arlington Historical Society. It has over 4000 artifacts representing all of the history of Arlington County. The museum is open on Saturdays and Sundays from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.
Arlington Historical Society
The Arlington Historical Society was founded in September 1956. It moved into the Hume school in 1960 and began an extensive restoration before opening the building as a museum in the early 1960s. The AHS continues as a non-profit organization supporting research, preservation, and education efforts related to the local history of Arlington County, Virginia. The Ball-Sellers House was donated to the Arlington Historical Society in 1975 for preservation and interpretation.
On Feb 15th, 2011, Arlington County announced that the 2011-2012 vehicle decal sticker would feature a photo of the Hume School taken by Wakefield High School junior Maya Giacobbe as part of a contest.

Annie Palmer is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Nadia Sawalha, from 6 May 1997 to 10 June 1999.
Storylines
When Annie arrived in Albert Square in 1997, they are believed to be a former business associate of George Palmer (Paul Moriarty). Together they open a print shop called "By The Letter" to cover their illegal deals, but Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) catches them hugging. Grant's mother Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) is dating George, so Grant tells them what they have seen; when Peggy confronts George, they tell them that Annie is their daughter. Annie takes over George's nightclub, The Cobra Club, renames it The Market Cellar, and uses it to facilitate their money-laundering operations and illegal gambling. Like their father, Annie is well-connected in the business world; the Palmer name also carries serious clout in the underworld. Annie soon builds themselves a small business empire in Albert Square. They get most of the local council on side and they are instrumental in helping Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) run for a council seat. They own a significant share of the Walford Health Club with Grant, and starts a loan-shark business with their brother Phil (Steve McFadden), not to mention their continuous dealing in money-laundering scams.
Annie is shrewd and smart and completely averse to showing any emotion, which comes from a desperate need to prove that they can cut it in a male-dominated business. They want to show their father that they can do their job as good as, if not better than, any man. But Annie's tough exterior masks a hidden vulnerability, so they rarely allow men to get close to them They have flings with Conor Flaherty (Seán Gleeson) (her loan-shark 'heavy') and Phil at the same time, and relishes watching them compete against each other for their affections. They later becomes close to their childhood friend Gianni di Marco (Marc Bannerman), but when they look likely to embark on a serious relationship, Annie's father drops the bombshell that Gianni may be their son. It is revealed that George had had an affair with Gianni's mother Rosa (Louise Jameson) behind Rosa's husband's back, and Gianni's paternity is unknown. The realisation that they could have been having an incestuous relationship with Annie devastates Gianni, and they cut all ties with both George and Annie. Blood tests later confirm that George isn't Gianni's father, which devastates them as they have always longed for a son who would inherit the family business. Seeing their father's devastation, Annie shows some rare emotion and tells them she'd always sensed their desperation for a son and that is why she'd always strived so hard to prove them worth. Unable to deal with Annie's emotion, George leaves England in 1998, leaving Annie to run their businesses on their own.
Annie's loan-shark business hits a setback in 1999, when they dabble on the turf of a rival business gang. Refusing to cede after receiving threats, they are beaten nearly to death by the gang's heavies. Although they show a brave front, their confidence is severely undermined.
Annie later becomes involved with fellow business person Steve Owen (Martin Kemp); the two are locked in a cat-and-mouse game of one-upmanship with each other. They manage to get through their prickly defences, and even manages to buy their nightclub, which they rename The E20. Annie hears news their father has been arrested in New Zealand for tax evasion so they turn to Steve for support and comfort, but they reject her, leaving them humiliated. To get back at him, they sell their health-club shares to Grant instead of him, but it is a hollow victory and in June 1999 they leaf Walford. They live with their father in New Zealand, where their import/export business is based.
Casting and departure
Sawalha spoke in an interview with Larry Jaffee about how they got the role of Annie saying that they auditioned with many other actores. They got through to the screen test with Victoria Gould who played Polly Becker. Sawalha has said that the only two they screen-tested were them and Victoria Gould: "We were always going to get the job. They hadn't decided which way they were going to go (who was going to be Annie and who Polly). They always have a vague idea of they want, and then they build the character around the person they choose. I was pleased when they turned it around." They also said they enjoyed playing "such a devilsome lady". Sawalha originally believed they may not be right for EastEnders saying,“My father is Arabic and my mother English. I just thought that I was too exotic — that there wasn't enough call for a foreigner.” In September 1998 it was revealed that Sawalha had quit the role.
Reception
Author Kate Lock described them as "a rather terrifying creation, a kind of dominatrix without the dungeon. A verbal Miss Whiplash, they tore strips off anyone who crosses her." The BBC described them as a 'tough-nut businesswoman'. They were also described as 'tough' and 'steel'. They were voted by What's on TV as the 85 sexiest soap sirens of all time out of 100. When Nadia announced their decision to leave it was described by The Mirror 'as a real shock' and that
'Her character, scheming Annie Palmer, has proved one of the most watchable in recent years.'

Common Sense, Common Safety (also known as the Young Report) was an October 2010 report by David Young, Baron Young of Graffham. It was commissioned by the British government to address a perceived compensation culture. The report made a number of recommendations to reduce bureaucracy over risk assessment requirements and to improve accountability of decisions made on health and safety grounds by local authorities. Young also recommended reform in the legal processes for personal injury claims and for limits to be placed on claims management companies.
Background
Common Sense, Common Safety was commissioned from David Young, Baron Young of Graffham by the British government and published in October 2010. It was an attempt by the government to address a perceived compensation culture in the United Kingdom. The British government of this period has been described as being pre-occupied with this matter and had previously implemented measures such as the Compensation Act 2006 to address it.
The media of this period were criticised for over-sensationalising events and activities that had been banned on health and safety grounds. Young's report cited a number of examples of "health and safety hysteria in the media" including a report that claimed police officers had been prevented from diving into water to try to save drowning persons and a circus clown who, it was claimed, was banned from wearing oversized shoes during their act.
Findings
Young made a series of recommendations that attempted to make sure health and safety was taken seriously whilst minimising the burden placed on small businesses. They recommended that the risk assessment process be simplified for low-hazard workplaces such as offices and shops and that the Health and Safety Executive make available a template to be used by such employers. They also recommended that many self-employed persons, working in low-hazard environments, and those that work from home be exempted from the requirement to carry out risk assessments.
Young also recommended that a standardised level of qualification was required for people practising as health and safety consultants and that a register be kept of such persons. They requested that insurance companies cease to specify that a consultant be employed to carry out a risk assessment in low-hazard workplaces. They made a number of recommendations for the educational sector as they thought the current process was too complicated and deterred teachers from taking children on trips out of school. They recommended that schools move away from risk assessments to risk-benefit assessments that take into account the benefits provided by play and leisure activities.
To address local authorities banning events on health and safety grounds Young recommended that they be required to record their specific reasons in writing and that they carry out an internal review of all such decisions. The report also recommended that a process be instituted by which citizens could refer decisions made by local authorities to an ombudsman who would review the decision within a fortnight.
In the legal field Young called for a simpler claims procedure to be implemented for personal injury (and possibly low-value medical negligence) claims, similar to one previously introduced to deal with road traffic claims. They also recommended that Lord Justice Rupert Jackson's Review of Civil Litigation Costs be implemented in full. Young requested that the work of claims management companies and referral agencies be restricted and the quantity of their advertisements limited. They also recommended that the government issue formal clarification that people will not be held responsible for the consequences of any well-intentioned actions.
Impact
The report received media attention after its publication and recently elected prime minister David Cameron stated that their cabinet accepted all of Young's recommendations. Construction union, UCATT, criticised Young for "belittling workplace safety" in one of their addresses in the House of Lords. Young was forced to resign as government health and safety and enterprise adviser by the end of 2010 over the matter. In response to Young's report the Health and Safety Executive set up a working group to spearhead the implementation of the report's recommendations for the education sector.
David Cameron referenced the report in 2012 which they stated would be the year in which the government "kills off the health and safety culture for good". In April that year the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations were amended to relax the requirement for reporting to only apply to injuries that prevented an employee from carrying out their usual work for seven days.

In graph theory, a quotient graph Q of a graph G is a graph whose vertices are blocks of a partition of the vertices of G and where block B is adjacent to block C if some vertex in B is adjacent to some vertex in C with respect to the edge set of G. In other words, if G has edge set E and vertex set V and R is the equivalence relation induced by the partition, then the quotient graph has vertex set V/R and edge set {([u]R, [v]R) | (u, v) ∈ E(G)}.
More formally, a quotient graph is a quotient object in the category of graphs. The category of graphs is concretizable – mapping a graph to its set of vertices makes it a concrete category – so its objects can be regarded as "sets with additional structure", and a quotient graph corresponds to the graph induced on the quotient set V/R of its vertex set V. Further, there is a graph homomorphism (a quotient map) from a graph to a quotient graph, sending each vertex or edge to the equivalence class that it belongs to. Intuitively, this corresponds to "gluing together" (formally, "identifying") vertices and edges of the graph.
Examples
A graph is trivially a quotient graph of itself (each block of the partition is a single vertex), and the graph consisting of a single point is the quotient graph of any non-empty graph (the partition consisting of a single block of all vertices). The simplest non-trivial quotient graph is one obtained by identifying two vertices (vertex identification); if the vertices are connected, this is called edge contraction.
Special types of quotient
The condensation of a directed graph is the quotient graph where the strongly connected components form the blocks of the partition. This construction can be used to derive a directed acyclic graph from any directed graph.
The result of one or more edge contractions in an undirected graph G is a quotient of G, in which the blocks are the connected components of the subgraph of G formed by the contracted edges. However, for quotients more generally, the blocks of the partition giving rise to the quotient do not need to form connected subgraphs.
If G is a covering graph of another graph H, then H is a quotient graph of G. The blocks of the corresponding partition are the inverse images of the vertices of H under the covering map. However, covering maps have an additional requirement that is not true more generally of quotients, that the map be a local isomorphism.
Computational complexity
It is NP-complete, given an -vertex cubic graph G and a parameter , to determine whether G can be obtained as a quotient of a planar graph with vertices.

Kabani or Kabanah () is a Syrian town in the Al-Haffah District in Latakia Governorate. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Kabani had a population of 902 in the 2004 census.
During the Syrian Civil War
In 2016, Kabani was under the control of the Free Syrian Army's 1st Coastal Division. It witnessed over a dozen consecutive military attacks (2015–16 Latakia offensive and 2016 Latakia offensive) to control it by the Syrian Army, since it is one of the highest points in Jabal al-Akrad, that overlooks the Al-Ghab Plains, and from where the rebels still had the ability to shell government strongholds like Qardaha. Despite numerous attempts by the Syrian army to take the city, rebels have succeeded in countering every Syrian army attack, until the latest offensive from 31 May 2020.
In January 2016 at the very latest Kabani became a jihadi stronghold after the fall of Salma to the Syrian Army. From 2017 on, the town was under the control of the Salafi jihadist groups Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham and the Turkistan Islamic Party. On May 19, 2019, these groups alleged that the Syrian government had released chlorine gas on their fighting forces in the town. According to them, four militants were wounded and taken to a hospital in the nearby rebel stronghold of Jisr al-Shughur, where they were treated.
In February 2021, the jihadis were subjected to air strikes that were not reported in western media.

Shadvidamargini (pronounced , meaning the one with the road to a hundred forms of knowledge) is a ragam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is the 46th melakarta rāgam (parent scale) in the 72 melakarta rāgam system of Carnatic music. It is called Stavarājam in Muthuswami Dikshitar school of Carnatic music.
Structure and Lakshana
It is the 4th rāgam in the 8th chakra Vasu. The mnemonic name is Vasu-Bhu. The mnemonic phrase is sa ra gi mi pa dhi ni. Its structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see swaras in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
:
:
The swaras shuddha rishabham, sadharana gandharam, prati madhyamam, chathusruthi dhaivatham and kaisiki nishadham are used in this scale. As it is a melakarta rāgam, by definition it is a sampoorna rāgam (has all seven notes in ascending and descending scale). It is the prati madhyamam equivalent of Natakapriya, which is the 10th melakarta scale.
Janya rāgams
Shadvidamargini has a few minor janya rāgams (derived scales) associated with it. See List of janya rāgams for full list of rāgams associated with Shadvidamargini.
Compositions
A few compositions set to Shadvidhamargini are:
Jnanam Osaga Rada by Tyagaraja
Andaranga Bhakthi by Koteeswara Iyer
Haimavate bhaja manasa by Dr. M. Balamuralikrishna
sharanam tava charanam by Bharani
Related rāgams
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
Shadvidamargini's notes when shifted using Graha bhedam, yields Nasikabhooshani, a minor melakarta rāgam. Graha bhedam is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the shadjam to the next note in the rāgam.

The Swampfox Entertainment Complex was an American amphitheater in Marion, South Carolina. The space has been vacant since 2009, with Hartmann Group of Connecticut reopening the venue on May 8, 2015. The facility, previously known as the Carolina Amphitheater, had over 7,000 fixed seats with additional seating capacity on the lawn.
The first event at the facility was the Swamp Fox Biker Bash, starring Scott Weiland, Molly Hatchet and The Chimpz.
The venue struggled to attract events due to weather and other issues. In 2020, Hartmann announced the removal of the amphitheater and the development of the property as a residential community oriented to retirees with retail and other components. A bar on the complex continued to operate until March 2021.

Joseph Lacasse (1894–1975) was a Belgian artist who enjoyed a career that spanned some sixty-five years, during which they stood at the helm of Abstraction.
Early years
Born in Tournai, Belgium in 1894 in a working-class family, Lacasse started their apprenticeship to become a painter-decorator as early as 1905. They were accepted the following year as a free student at the Ecole des Beaux Arts of Tournai where they continued their training until 1921. As a young boy, Lacasse worked alongside their father as a stone-cutter in a local quarry. Their abstract pastels, dated 1910, were painted after a day of hard work, where the austere structure of the quarry fired their imagination. These early pastels are completely geometrical, though not symmetrical, and their aggressive shapes are softened by rounded lines. They are dominated by a powerful black construction, traced with great surety.
After surviving the First World War, Lacasse became a successful painter of figurative scenes illustrating the condition of the working classes, often depicted against a religious background. Following a trip to South Italy in 1921, where they painted their ‘motherhood' series, always in a style of emphasized realism, they decided to enroll at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts, Brussels where Lacasse met their future wife, Stephanie Lupsin, daughter of the renowned art dealer.
The First Paris Period
Following several travels to Italy, Brittany and Spain, Lacasse finally decided to settle in Paris in 1925. Here, their acquaintance with Robert Delaunay was crucial to their colouristic development. During this period they also became friend with neighbouring Constantin Brâncuși and the writers Robert Garric and Henry Poulaille. Throughout the thirties, Lacasse turned to Abstraction for consolation from the disillusionment over the painting and the forced removal of their frescoes at the Dominican Chapel at Juvisy during 1931-32.
In 1933 Lacasse founded the gallery L'Equipe inspired by their socialist ideas that artists of all disciplines should come together to exchange ideas and to fight for the right to be shown. The gallery played an important role on the Parisian art scene with exhibitions showing the works of many including Jacques Lipchitz, Moïse Kisling, Francis Picabia and Pablo Picasso. Lacasse themselves had a one-man show at L'Equipe in 1937 during which they showed some of their abstract work. Lacasse's coloristic developments of the time also testify their great admiration for Robert Delaunay whom, according to Michel Seuphor, they met in 1931 and whose gatherings at their studio Lacasse attended during 1938 and 1939. Other artists they met included Serge Poliakoff, who then started visiting L'Equipe. At the time of their meeting Poliakoff was still committed to figuration. In 1939 L'Equipe published its first three magazines.
The Second World War
At the outbreak of the Second World War, Lacasse decided to join General de Gaulle's Resistance by moving to London with the Free French Forces. During the five years of wars Lacasse seemed to have put aside painting while teaching sculpture and ceramics in Stoke-on-Trent. During this period they were totally cut off from their family.
The Second Paris Period
Their absence from Paris cost them dearly for the Parisian artistic community had continued without him. In a moment of depression, they destroyed more than a hundred paintings. Having become a French citizen in 1946, Lacasse, encouraged by their wife and friends, went back to painting. Until their death in 1975, Lacasse's work became the subject of countless exhibitions abroad including UK, Germany and the USA.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wingcopter partnered with Thales, Skyports, and the NHS to provide beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) delivery of medical test samples and other supplies to a hospital on a remote Scottish island. The company has been recognized by the World Economic Forum as "2020 Technology Pioneer". The company is amongst ten other drone companies to be selected by FAA to participate in a type certification program for delivery drones.
History
Wingcopter GmbH was founded in 2017 by Jonathan Hesselbarth, Tom Plümmer, and Ansgar Kadura in Darmstadt, Germany. In 2018, the company partnered with DHL and the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) to deliver medicine and critical supplies to the Ukerewe island district of Lake Victoria, Tanzania. In 2019, the company partnered with UNICEF to set up an on-demand delivery network, supplying 19 remote villages with vaccines from one central hub on the South Pacific island of Pentecost, Vanuatu. The Wingcopter 178 HL has also been used to survey whales in the Arctic region. During the 2020 African Drone Forum, Wingcopter was judged as the winner of the Emergency Delivery category of the Flying Competition and received a special award for its safety procedures. In 2020, Corecam Capital Partners invested several million euros into the company as seed funding In January 2021, Wingcopter raised $22 million in its Seris A funding round, intending to expand its operations into the United States of America. Its investors include Xplorer Capital, which has previously invested in ride-hailing service Uber and self-driving car start-up Zoox.
In May 2022, Wingcopter announced a partnership with Continental Drones designed to establish a delivery network spanning 49 countries across Sub-Sahara Africa. The deal sets the goal of deploying 12,000 of Wingcopter's 198 drone systems over the course of the next 5 years.
Aircraft
W178
Wingcopter 178 is the first mass produced version of the Wingcopter drones which first took flight in early 2013. At present, the drone has an external dimension of 178 cm x 132 cm x 52 cm and can carry a payload of up to 6 kg in its external transportation box measuring 103 cm x 87 cm x 57. The aircraft is capable of beyond visual line of sight flight and can transition from hover to fixed-wing flight configuration during forward flight by making use of its proprietary tiltrotor mechanism. To deliver its payload, the drone can employ a winch mechanism to slow-drop a single-use cargo box at the location without the need for landing. It can also deliver and collect cargo by landing at the destination to enable two-way delivery of medical samples, lab results, and supplies.
W198
Wingcopter 198 is the latest commercial drone launched by wingcopter in April 2021 and is the world's first triple drop delivery drone. It has an external dimension of 198 x 152 x 65 cm and can carry up to three packages up to 5 kg. The drones, have automated sensors and software to avoid obstacles and drop parcels at designated sites, enabling one operator to monitor and control up to 10 of these new drones.
Projects
Humanitarian mission
As part of a humanitarian aid project in Malawi in 2019/20, medicines were delivered by Wingcopter to remote areas that were partially cut off from the outside world by a flood. Wingcopter has also been active with UNICEF and DHL in delivering vaccines and other medications in Vanuatu and some African nations. Along with UNICEF and African Drone & Data Academy (ADDA), it aims to use Wingcopter drones to improve health supply chains during COVID-19 and to open up new long-term opportunities for Africa's youth. It was announced as one of the winners of the German government's €24 million COVID-19 hackathon to combat corona-related repercussions in Africa. As a part of this project, Wingcopter envisions setting up a locally operated delivery drone network in Malawi to support the local healthcare system. In parallel, the partners will also build local capacity through two distinct training programs for 160 Malawian youths. After proving the concept's viability and successful implementation in Malawi, Wingcopter and UNICEF plan to adapt the concept and scale to Rwanda.
Partnership with UPS
In 2020, Wingcopter partnered with UPS to develop the next generation of package delivery drones. Together, they will be working towards building a diverse fleet of drones with varying capabilities to meet even more potential customer needs. As part of this collaboration, both companies will work toward earning regulatory certification for Wingcopter drones to make commercial delivery flights in the United States and beyond.
Inter-city delivery
Wingcopter in partnership with Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences has teamed up with Merck to transport pigment samples from a Merck site in Gernsheim, Germany to a lab in Darmstadt (around 25 km). The proposed project aims to replace the existing slower, less sustainable, and more expensive van delivery program.

The masked tityra (Tityra semifasciata) is a medium-sized passerine bird. It has traditionally been placed in the cotinga or the tyrant flycatcher family, but evidence strongly suggests that it is better placed in Tityridae, where it is now placed by the South American Classification Committee.
It is found in forest and woodland from Mexico, through Central America, to northwestern and central South America (as far south as Paraguay).
Measuring , it has a black-and-whitish plumage, and a distinct red eye-ring and base of the bill. The head is black in the male, while it is brownish or greyish in the female. The male resembles the black-tailed tityra, but can be separated by its smaller black face mask (does not include the nape) and white tail-tip.

New Zealand Force South East Asia (NZFORSEA) (1974–1989) comprised the elements of the Royal New Zealand Navy, New Zealand Army and Royal New Zealand Air Force. Much of the New Zealand military left Singapore as part of operation Kupe in 1989, leaving behind a residual Defence Support Unit (NZDSU).
Background
Although New Zealand has had a military presence in South East Asia for most of the post WWII period, it was not until the disestablishment of the ANZUK Force in 1974, comprising Australian, New Zealand and United Kingdom military personnel, that New Zealand established a self-supporting national presence in the region.
Formally established on 30 January 1974, NZFORSEA was under the direct command of Ministry of Defence in New Zealand. Although NZFORSEA was based in Singapore, its normal area of operation, the territories of Malaysia and Singapore, was identical with its predecessor, the ANZUK Force.

Enhance New Zealand's political and diplomatic influence in the region.
Assist the development of the Armed Forces of countries in the area.
Implement the Mutual Assistance Programme, where the force provided assistance and conducted exercises with armed forces of countries in the area, particularly those of Singapore and Malaysia.
With the Headquarters sited at the Stores Basin area adjacent to the current Sembawang Naval Basin, This was the last major foreign military presence based in Singapore. Total military strength at the time stood at 850 with some 700 dependants. NZFORSEA took over many of British married quarters, recreational and welfare facilities at Née Soon, Sembawang and Woodlands.
Units of the NZFORSEA

Girls Trip is a 2017 American comedy film starring Regina Hall, Queen Latifah, Tiffany Haddish, and Jada Pinkett Smith. The film is directed by Malcolm D. Lee and written by Kenya Barris and Tracy Oliver, from a story by the pair and Erica Rivinoja, who based the script off their own experiences with their female friends. Along with Lee, the film was produced by Will Packer under their Will Packer Productions banner. It follows a group of four friends who go to New Orleans to attend the Essence Music Festival in order to reconnect after a long time.
The cast was announced in June 2016, with principal photography taking place that month in New Orleans, Louisiana. The film also filmed during the 2016 Essence Music Festival, casting over 5000 background actors.
Girls Trip premiered at the American Black Film Festival in Miami on June 14, 2017 and was theatrically released in the United States by Universal Pictures on July 21, 2017. It received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics, with many praising the cast performances and the film's originality. It was chosen by Time magazine as one of its top ten films of 2017. It was also a massive commercial success, grossing $140 million worldwide on its $19 million production budget including over $100 million domestically, the first comedy of 2017 to do so. It was also the first time a film written by an African-American female screenwriter had crossed the $100 million mark at the box office.
The film received multiple awards and nominations from various award and critic organizations, including Outstanding Motion Picture and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture for Haddish at the 49th NAACP Image Awards. It received seven nominations at the 18th Black Reel Awards, with Haddish winning two awards for their performance.
Plot
In an attempt to reconnect with their friends from college, lifestyle guru Ryan Pierce, dubbed "the next Oprah," decides to invite their friends on a girls' trip to Essence Music Festival in New Orleans, where they will be the keynote speaker. Known as the "Flossy Posse," the group includes Sasha, a former journalist from Time magazine who now owns a floundering gossip site and is struggling financially; Lisa, a nurse and uptight single mother who has not had a boyfriend since their divorce years earlier; and Dina, a happy-go-lucky, impulsive party animal who was fired from their job after harming a co-worker who accidentally ate them lunch.
Shortly after arriving, Sasha receives a photo of Ryan's husband Stewart kissing another woman. The friends are reluctant to tell Ryan initially, but Ryan admits they are already aware of the situation and informs their friends that the two are in couple's therapy to address Stewart's infidelity. After Dina confronts Stewart at their hotel with a broken bottle, the Flossy Posse are ejected and settles into a one-star motel instead. At the Essence Fest later that night, they run into an old friend Julian, a musician performing at the festival who Ryan flirts with. They later gives up their hotel suite so that the women have somewhere decent to stay.
The next day, Ryan and Stewart host a cooking demonstration together at the music festival that goes awry when Stewart's mistress, Simone, shows up. A potential investor is impressed, however, and a business meeting is set up for Ryan and Stewart with their agent, Elizabeth, who then introduces Ryan and Stewart to Bethany Marshall. Dina serves the women absinthe right before the meeting, causing them to hallucinate. At their meeting, Ryan thinks the waiter is Stewart's mistress; Lisa thinks their kids are at the club with her; Dina thinks they are flying; and Sasha thinks they are making out with an attractive man who is actually a lamp. The girls eventually pull Ryan out of the meeting and decide to go to a club to dance the absinthe off. They run into Simone and their friends and engage in a dance off before getting in a bar fight. Julian picks them up before they can get arrested and takes them back to their hotel.
Ryan and Stewart are offered a massive deal from the chain store Best Mart, whose representative wants to hire them as spokespeople. Ryan goes out to celebrate with the girls at one of Julian's shows. Simone shows up and tells Sasha that they are pregnant. They offer to give Sasha's blog exclusive content to their affair with pictures as well. Stewart once again goes to Ryan to convince them to stay with them to finalize their deal. Simone goes public with the affair, and Ryan accuses Sasha of being the one who leaked the pictures. The fight spills out into the relationship of all the women and they all part on bad terms.
Dina and Lisa make up quickly. After Sasha decides to take down their blog, disgusted with the celebrity gossip racket, Dina and Lisa reunite with them As Ryan begins to give their keynote speech on the last day of the music festival and denies that the picture of Stewart and Simone is real, they see their friends walk into the room. Ryan breaks from their scripted remarks, admitting the picture and affair are real. The speech is a success and when the women reunite after the show, Ryan apologizes to Sasha. Ryan's agent arrives and tells Ryan that the deal with Best Mart is still on but with them alone. Ryan decides to take Sasha as their business partner the way they planned to be years ago. A series of events shows the girls happily reunited and Ryan beginning a relationship with Julian.

Lee and producer Will Packer would collaborate on a film tentatively titled Girls Trip, with South Park writer Erica Rivinoja attached to script. In May 2016, Universal set a release date of August 11, 2017 for the film. It was also reported that Regina Hall would star, and Kenya Barris and Tracy Oliver were rewriting the script. Oliver told The Hollywood Reporter that they wanted to break down the barriers of respectability politics and portray "Black women being carefree and having fun just like everybody else. I think we need to show all aspects of black lives. I love Moonlight, I love Hidden Figures, but I also want to see some people who are having fun and just showing female friends hanging out." Queen Latifah and Jada Pinkett Smith joined the cast in early June 2016, and Larenz Tate joined later that month. The film's release date was changed to July 21, 2017, as principal photography began in late June 2016 in New Orleans, and included filming at the 2016 Essence Music Festival.
A teaser trailer for the film was released on January 31, 2017. A red band trailer for the film was released on February 9, 2017.

Reception
Box office
Girls Trip grossed $115.2 million in the United States and Canada and $24.9 million in other territories for a total gross of $140.9 million, against a net production budget of $20–28 million. Deadline Hollywood calculated the film made a net profit of $66.1 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.
Girls Trip opened alongside Dunkirk and Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets on July 21, 2017, and was projected to gross around $20 million from 2,583 theaters, with industry experts saying it could debut as high as $30 million. It made $11.7 million on its first day, including $1.7 million from Thursday night previews at 2,195 theaters. The film grossed $31.2 million in its opening weekend, finishing second at the box office behind Dunkirk and marked the largest opening of director Malcolm D. Lee's career; 52% of its opening weekend audience was African-American, with an overall 60% being women over 25. In its second week the film dropped just 37% and grossed $19.6 million, finishing 3rd at the box office behind Dunkirk and newcomer The Emoji Movie, and in its third week the film made $11.4 million, finishing 4th. On August 17, the film crossed the $100 million mark domestically, becoming the first comedy of 2017 to do so.
Critical response
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 177 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site's critics consensus reads: "Girls Trip is the rare R-rated comedy that pushes boundaries to truly comedic effect—and anchors its laughs in compelling characters brought to life by a brilliantly assembled cast." On Metacritic, the film has a score of 71 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A+" on an A+ to F scale, and PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 82% overall positive score, with 67% saying they would definitely recommend it.
For Variety, Peter Debruge wrote "When it comes to Hollywood studio comedies, most of the time, we are lucky to get one unforgettable set piece, whereas Girls Trip screenwriters Kenya Barris and Tracy Oliver deliver at least half a dozen. And rather than simply letting an effective joke stand, they double down, milking it for all it's worth." For CinemaBlend, Mike Reyes wrote "While there's still plenty of time worn clichés in Girls Trip, there is a genuine sense of friendship, and comedy throughout, that make the film one of this summer's most surprising comedies. You can believe that these four women are the best of friends, which is something that's not always easy or focused on in a comedy of this type. Girls Trip has an energy that's undeniable, eventually winning audience members over with a theme of friendship that's well built in the context of the film."
Awards
Potential sequel
In January 2019, Pinkett-Smith discussed a potential sequel to Girls Trip, stating "I'm ready for more Flossy Posse, trust me. I'm ready to have some fun with my girls!", and giving Rio de Janeiro or South Africa as potential locations for the film. In April 2019 Latifah confirmed that a sequel was "definitely happening," but Haddish stated just days later that talks had stalled.
In March 2020, Haddish confirmed Tracy Oliver had a treatment "ready to go", and would begin working on the script. Haddish added "We might decide not to even make it Girls Trip, maybe we'll do a different story just in case no one wants to make Girls Trip 2".

The Walsh Flats/Langworth Building was located in downtown Davenport, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.
History
The Langworth Building was a rare combination of automobile showroom on the main floor and apartments located above. The building reflects two new trends in building types that appeared in Davenport at the turn of the 20th-century. The first trend was the construction of multiple-family apartment buildings with Neoclassical features and composition. The second trend is the appearance of showrooms for auto dealers and garages in response to the arrival of the automobile.
Walsh Flats is noteworthy as the residence of Dr. C.L. Barewald. Barewald was a Socialist who ran for mayor of Davenport in 1918 and lost by only a few votes. However, two other Socialists, George Peck and Walter Bracher, were elected aldermen from two predominantly German wards. In 1920 Barewald won a significant majority of the votes and was elected mayor. The two Socialist aldermen were also returned to office. Their election may have come about because German voters were dissatisfied with the Democratic party's war stance and the Republican party's prohibition stance. During their term in office several public works projects were begun. They include the extension of Kirkwood sewer and the construction of a municipal natatorium on the riverfront. Their term in office, however, was marked by office and fiscal upheaval. Their policies put hundreds of unemployed people back to work, but their spending to accomplish this was not sanctioned by a fiscally conservative electorate. Barewald and the two aldermen were voted out of office in 1922. The building itself exemplifies Barewald's austere lifestyle and symbolic of the Socialist's populist political stance.
The automobile dealership eventually moved to the north side of the city, but an auto repair shop remained in the back. Walsh Flats-Langworth Building was located between the Scott County Courthouse and Davenport City Hall. Several years after it was torn down the Davenport Police Department headquarters were built on the property.
Architecture
The Neoclassical style building was designed by Davenport architect Gustav Hanssen and completed in 1910. It was four stories tall and the exterior was composed of brick and stone that were placed over a metal frame. It featured a 20-bay main facade. There were four stairhalls that were indicated by two windows and a decorative panel that were grouped vertically beneath a round keystone arch.

Stillwater Mountain is a mountain in Adirondack Mountains of New York. It is located south of Stillwater in the town of Webb in Herkimer County. In 1919, a steel fire lookout tower was built on the mountain. At the end of the 1988 fire lookout season, the tower ceased fire lookout operation. The tower was restored and is open to the public except from the second Tuesday in October through December 20.
Fire tower
In 1912, a wood fire lookout tower was built on the mountain by New York State Conservation Commission, now known as the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. In 1919, the wood tower was replaced with a Aermotor model LS-40 steel fire tower. At the end of the 1988 fire lookout season, the tower ceased fire lookout operation. The next year, the tower was officially closed when the Department of Environmental Conservation determined that aerial detection was better for fire lookout purposes. The tower remains on land owned by the Lyme Timber Company, and with an agreement with the Department of Environmental Conservation is open to the public except from the second Tuesday in October through December 20, which is during hunting season. A group, The Friends Of Stillwater Fire Tower, reorganized in 2015 and fully restored the tower by July, 2016. Volunteer flight attendants staff the tower on weekends during the summer.

Singapore competed at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 September to 18 September 2016.
13 Singaporeans were sent to compete in six sports: archery, athletics, boccia, equestrian, sailing, and swimming.
Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.
Medalists
Archery
For the first time in history, Singapore qualified for the archery competition at a Paralympic Games. Nur Syahidah Binte Alim sealed gold in the women's compound open and compound mixed open at the 8th ASEAN Para Games, securing a historic spot for Singapore at Rio 2016.

Ctenocheirodon pristis is a species of characin native to South America that can grow up to 3.4 cm long (only 3.3 for males). It is the only known member of its genus. Its specific name comes from the Greek word pristis, which means saw. This refers to the projected fins on the underside of the fish.
Habitat
C. pristis is a freshwater fish and it lives in the drainage basin of the Rio Tocantins in South America. It lives in areas of slow-moving water over river bottoms with little vegetation. As a result of the location, C. pristis lives exclusively in tropical areas.

A vertical service code (VSC) is a sequence of digits and the signals star (*) and number sign (#) dialed on a telephone keypad vertical service code or rotary dial to enable or disable certain telephone service features. Some vertical service codes require dialing of a telephone number after the code sequence. On a touch tone telephone, the codes are usually initiated with the star key, resulting in the commonly used name star codes. On rotary dial telephones, the star is replaced by dialing 11.
In North American telephony, VSCs were developed by AT&T Corp. as Custom Local Area Signaling Services (CLASS or LASS) codes in the 1960s and 70s. Their use became ubiquitous throughout the 1990s and eventually became a recognized standard. As CLASS was an AT&T trademark, the term vertical service code was adopted by the North American Numbering Plan Administration. The use of vertical is a somewhat dated reference to older switching methods and the fact that these services can only be accessed by a local telephone subscriber, going up (vertically) inside the local central office instead of out (horizontally) to another telephone company.

North America & elsewhere
The following are the vertical service codes generally recommended by the North American Numbering Plan Administration for use in the NANP territories. Not all of these services are available in all areas, and some are only available to landline or cellular telephones.

Charles Frederick Kip Winger (born June 21, 1961) is an American bass guitarist and singer, active as a member of the rock band Winger and as a solo artist. They initially gained notability as a member of Alice Cooper's band, contributing bass and vocals to their Constrictor and Raise Your Fist and Yell albums.
Biography
Early days
Winger was born in Colorado to parents who were both musicians. At age 16, Winger began studying classical music after hearing the works of composers such as Debussy, Ravel, and Stravinsky in ballet class. At that time they sent a demo tape to Alan Parsons, from whom they received a personal reply.
As a teenager, Winger played in a band named Blackwood Creek with their brothers Nate and Paul plus friend Peter Fletcher (formerly in Pigmy Love Circus). Blackwood Creek disbanded in 1980. Kip, their brothers, and Fletcher also played the Denver area bar scene as the band Colorado. Winger's first release was a Rainbow Music Hall live recording of the song "Wizard of the Key" on the KAZY Thunder on the Mountain compilation in 1980 under the band name Winger which was the Colorado band line-up under a different name.
In 1982, they studied with Sam Guarnaccia in Denver then moved to New York City and waited tables while studying composition with Edgar Grana.
Success
Kip Winger's first commercial break came in 1984, when they co-wrote the song "Bang Bang" for Kix's third album, Midnite Dynamite. During that time they were working closely with the record producer Beau Hill, recording bass and vocals on various records. While Reb Beach was working on Fiona Flanagan's Beyond the Pale record at the Atlantic, Winger and Beach were introduced to each other and later began recording demos. In 1985, Winger joined Alice Cooper's band. After making two albums and touring with Cooper, much of the time alongside keyboardist/guitarist Paul Taylor, Winger left in March 1987 to focus on their own band.
Winger returned to New York to work on songs with Reb Beach, and they were soon joined by Paul Taylor and drummer Rod Morgenstein. They initially performed under the name Sahara, but eventually changed their name to Winger, at Alice Cooper's suggestion.
The band Winger released three albums (Winger (1988), In the Heart of the Young (1990), and Pull (1993)) before moving on to solo careers.
Solo career
Kip Winger then moved to New Mexico to work on their solo career, and study with Richard Hermann at the University of New Mexico.
They worked and recorded three solo records in Santa Fe, New Mexico: This Conversation Seems Like a Dream, Down Incognito and Songs from the Ocean Floor.
In 2002 Winger moved to Nashville, Tennessee and began working on their fourth solo record, From the Moon to the Sun (2008), which they co-produced with Cenk Eroglu.
Reunited Winger
In September 2006, it was announced that Winger would be reformed, with the Pull era line-up, to record the band's fourth studio album, IV, and to go on tour to support it. During this tour, Winger recorded Winger Live which was released on CD and DVD in 2007. It was also confirmed that an anthology of rare tracks and early recordings, Demo Anthology (2007) would be released, as well as an autographed limited-edition album, Seventeen: The Demos, where only 300 copies were made.
In 2009, Winger recorded their fifth studio album, Karma, which was hailed as their best record. The band toured the US, Europe and South America.
Classical music
Following the release of From the Moon to the Sun, Winger studied with Michael Kurek and composed a thirty-minute symphonic piece, "Ghosts", written for strings, piano and harp for a ballet commission. The work had its premiere with the Tucson Symphony Orchestra on November 14–15, 2009. Choreographer Christopher Wheeldon created the ballet "Ghosts", which premiered at the San Francisco Ballet on February 9, 2010, with set design by Laura Jellinek, lighting design by M.L. Geiger and costume design by Mark Zappone.
Winger was nominated for an Isadora Duncan Award for Excellence in Music. The ballet was a hit and was brought back for a second season in 2010.
Winger then composed a four-part work entitled C.F. Kip Winger: Conversations with Nijinsky, intended to celebrate the life of ballet dancer and choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky. The album was recorded by the San Francisco Ballet Orchestra and reached the top of the Traditional Classical Chart on the Billboard music charts.
C.F. Kip Winger: Conversations with Nijinsky was nominated in the Best Classical Contemporary Composition category at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.
Get Jack, A Musical Thriller
Kip Winger's theatrical composing debut is the musical thriller Get Jack, with book/lyrics by Damien Gray (Atomic the Musical, Animagique, Sing On Tour). The story revolves around the five female victims of Jack the Ripper. Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, and Mary Jane Kelly—known as the "canonical five"—who rise from the dead to track down Jack and take revenge.
Get Jack is currently on development stage, with director Kelly Devine and musical director Andy Peterson, and was presented in concert in October 2019 in New York.
Winger and Gray released the rock/orchestral Get Jack concept album in July 2019, which entered at #7 on Billboards Cast Albums chart.
Miscellaneous
Winger's composition "Blue Suede Shoes" from the album IV honored the service and sacrifice of the United States armed forces and their families. In appreciation, General Harold Cross presented Winger with an honorary plaque and historic United States of America flag. The presentation occurred in a surprise ceremony during the taping of the PBS television program Legends & Lyrics.
On the television program Beavis and Butt-Head, one of the recurring characters, Stewart Stevenson, wears a Winger T-shirt in contrast to the AC/DC and Metallica shirts worn by Beavis and Butt-Head.
They have participated and performed as head counselor in the Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp with other musicians including Roger Daltrey, Steven Tyler, Todd Rundgren, Jack Blades, Kelly Keagy, Bruce Kulick, Bill Leverty, Steve Lukather, Duff McKagan, Mark Slaughter, Carmine Appice, and Rudy Sarzo. They were featured in an episode of the American TV show Pawn Stars in May 2013 as helping the host, Rick Harrison, through Rock Fantasy Camp.
In the early 1990s, the Jackson Guitar Company made a Kip Winger Signature Bass.
Personal life
During the late 1980s, Winger was in a relationship with New Zealand supermodel Rachel Hunter who married musician Rod Stewart soon after their breakup with Winger.
Winger married Beatrice Richter in 1991. However, in November 1996, they were killed in an automobile accident.
They married Paula DeTullio in July 2004 and divorced in 2019.

On 23 April 2009, a clash erupted between the border guards of Afghanistan and Iran in Nimroz province near the Afghanistan–Iran border. One Iranian border guard was killed in the clash and another border guard was captured by the Afghan border police. According to General Saifullah Hakim, head of Afghanistan's border police in Nimroz, the cause of the clash was the incursion by the Iranian border guards into the Tang district of Nimroz province.

In the resulting shoot-out with Afghan border police in Tang district, one Iranian border guard was killed while another was captured. General Hakim says that this has been acknowledged by the Iranian officials and the detained soldier along with the body of the deceased soldier will be returned to Iran. Iran's Press TV also reported the death one Iranian soldier and the capture of the other by the Afghan border police.

Bis(diethylamino)chlorophosphine is an organophosphorus compound with the formula (Et2N)2PCl (Et = ethyl). A colorless liquid, it serves as a masked source of PCl2+.
Synthesis and reactions
The compound is prepared by treatment of phosphorus trichloride with diethylamine:
4 Et2NH + PCl3 → (Et2N)2PCl + 2 Et2NH2Cl
Illustrative of its utility is the synthesis of 1,2-bis(dichlorophosphino)benzene. The synthesis involves sequential lithiation of 1,2-dibromobenzene followed by treatment with (Et2N)2PCl:
C6H4Br2 + BuLi → C6H4(Br)Li + BuBr
C6H4(Br)Li + (Et2N)2PCl → C6H4(Br)(P(NEt2)2) + LiCl
C6H4(Br)(P(NEt2)2) + BuLi → C6H4(Li)(P(NEt2)2) + BuBr
C6H4(Li)(P(NEt2)2) + (Et2N)2PCl → C6H4[P(NEt2)2]2 + LiCl
Finally, the amino substituents are removed using hydrogen chloride:
C6H4[P(NEt2)2]2 + 8 HCl → C6H4(PCl2)2 + 4 Et2NH2Cl

Kinbuck is a hamlet in Stirlingshire, Scotland. It lies by the Allan Water and the Stirling-Perth Railway line. It is four miles north of Dunblane.
Facilities
Despite a campaign to save it, Kinbuck Primary School was controversially closed in 1998. At the time its closure was announced the school had just 24 pupils and the action saved the local authority over £30000 annually. Students from the village were then sent to nearby Newton Primary School. The Victorian building remains standing and is now used as the village's community centre, where several events are held annually for all to attend.
History
Kinbuck was the location of the retreat of the Jacobite troops under the Earl of Mar following the Battle of Sheriffmuir on 13 November 1715.
Nearby is the B listed Kinbuck Bridge as well as the A listed Cromlix House, former seat of Viscount Strathallan and the Clan Drummond family. Cromlix house is now a hotel.
Electricity/Gas
Due to its rural location the hamlet is often subject to power and gas outages.
Kinbuck is situated at the start of the controversial Beauly-Denny power line.
Flooding
The area around Kinbuck floods easily due to the proximity of the River Allan.

Strangeways, Here We Come is the fourth and final studio album by English rock band the Smiths. It was released on 28 September 1987 by Rough Trade Records, several months after the group had disbanded. All of the songs were composed by Johnny Marr, with lyrics written and sung by Morrissey.
Rolling Stone said the record "stands as one of their best and most varied". Slant Magazine listed the album at No. 69 on its list of "Best Albums of the 1980s", writing that "Whether or not Strangeways, Here We Come ended the Smiths' brief career with their best album has been the subject of considerable debate for nearly a quarter century, but it definitively stands as the band's most lush, the richest work."
The album reached number two on the UK Albums Chart, staying in the chart for 17 weeks. The album also became an international success, peaking at number 16 in the European Albums Chart; from sales covering the 18 major European countries, staying in that chart for nine weeks. The album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry on 1 October 1987 and also by the Recording Industry Association of America on 19 September 1990.
Recording
The Smiths recorded what was to be their final studio album at the Wool Hall studios in Beckington, Somerset, England (established and then-owned by the band Tears for Fears). Between the album's recording in March and its release in September 1987, Johnny Marr left the group, ending the band. Strangeways is the only Smiths album to feature Morrissey playing a musical instrument: piano, on the song "Death of a Disco Dancer".
Marr felt the band was ready to enter a new musical phase, and was determined to avoid a formula and move away from their previous "jingle jangle" sound. They started to look for different influences, finding an interest in the Beatles' self-titled 1968 album. Marr further stated that they intended Strangeways as an homage to early records by the Walker Brothers. The band's instrumentation branched out as well, including synthesised saxophone, string arrangements on keyboards, and drum machine additions.
Recording in the Wool Hall made the sessions more relaxed, as the wine cellar was fully stocked and producer Stephen Street came slowly to understand the idea that the writing partners Morrissey and Marr were trying to put forth. Street (who engineered previous Smiths efforts) later said that there would always be late-night drinking following the recording sessions. "That was always after Morrissey had gone to bed ... it wasn't really their bag. We'd carry on finishing overdubs and then the records would come out. We'd be partying all hours". Ed Power wrote in The Independent that "Everyone else was more than willing to join [Marr] in this new love affair. Parties at Wool House became a nightly event. With Morrissey tucked up in bed with their favourite Sylvia Plath anthology, the musicians would cover their favourite Spinal Tap songs into the wee hours".
Morrissey and Marr have stated that the album is the band's best, with Morrissey adding, "We say it quite often. At the same time. In our sleep. But in different beds". Drummer Mike Joyce also named the album as the band's best.
Two final songs were recorded in May 1987 to provide B-sides for the album's lead single, "Girlfriend in a Coma". These were the Smiths' last recordings together. Three more singles were taken from Strangeways, Here We Come; their B-sides were drawn from archival recordings.
Artwork and title
The sleeve for Strangeways, Here We Come, which was designed by Morrissey, features a murky shot of actor Richard Davalos, best known for appearing in the 1955 film East of Eden. In the photo, Davalos is looking at their costar in that film, James Dean, who is cropped from the image. Dean was a hero of Morrissey's, about whom the singer wrote a book called James Dean Is Not Dead. Five years later, when designing the sleeves for the U.S. release of WEA's Best... I compilation, Morrissey again chose Davalos as a cover star, and Davalos is looking at Dean, who is once again cropped.
As revealed in Jo Slee's collection of Smiths and Morrissey sleeve artwork, Peepholism, Davalos was not the original choice for cover star. Morrissey wanted to use a still of Harvey Keitel in Martin Scorsese's 1967 film I Call First (also known as Who's That Knocking at My Door), but Keitel declined to allow them to use the image. In 1991, Keitel relented, and the image was used on T-shirts and stage backdrops for Morrissey's 1991 Kill Uncle Tour.
The album takes its title from Manchester's notorious Strangeways Prison (now called HM Prison Manchester), whilst the line "Borstal, here we come" is taken from the novel Billy Liar. "Strangeways, of course, is that hideous Victorian monstrosity of a prison operating 88 to a cell," Morrissey has said.
Marr has said "I've learned to love the title ... it was a bit overstating things somewhat. A little bit obvious. But it's OK. I was always intrigued by the word Strangeways. I remember as a kid, when I first heard that the prison was really called that, I wondered had it not occurred to anybody to change the name? It's still befuddling, really". Morrissey has also stated, "Really it's me throwing both arms to the skies and yelling 'Whatever next?'"
Reception
Commercial
The album rose to No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 55 on the US Billboard 200.
Critical
The album ranked number 3 among "Albums of the Year" for 1987 in the annual NME critics' poll, and "Girlfriend in a Coma" ranked number 11 among songs. In 2000 it was voted number 601 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums.
Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it was "a subtly shaded and skilled album, one boasting a fuller production than before ... while it doesn't match The Queen Is Dead or The Smiths, it is far from embarrassing and offers a summation of the group's considerable strengths."

GenderPAC (the Gender Public Advocacy Coalition) was a LGBT rights organization based in Washington, DC working to ensure that classrooms, communities, and workplaces were safe places for every person to learn, grow, and succeed, whether or not they conform to expectations for masculinity or femininity. It was active from 1995 to 2009.
Activities
Generally considered the first national political organization devoted to issues of "gender identity and expression" and representing the transgender community, GenderPAC aimed to promote understanding of the connection between discrimination based on gender stereotypes and gender, sexual orientation, age, race and class. GenderPAC's major programs were Workplace Fairness, Gender Equality National Index for Universities & Schools (GENIUS) Congressional Diversity Pledge, GenderYOUTH Network, and the Children As They Are parenting network.
The organization argued that violence and discrimination based on gender variance was not limited to people who identified as trans. It was often, however, categorised as a transgender rights organization.
GenderPAC's annual budget grew to $250,000 in its first five years of existence, and topped out at $1,200,000 when it ceased operations in 2009. Most of its revenue came from LGBT funders and also from corporate sponsorships, with small amounts from individual donor contributions and events.
History
GenderPAC was founded in 1995 by Riki Wilchins as an association of existing transgender organizations, in response to a lack of inclusion of transgender and gender-variant issues by national gay and lesbian organizations, and grew quickly. Its areas of activism included incidents of discrimination against trans and gender-variant people, as well as youth and issues of workplace fairness.
In 1996, the group began holding National Gender Lobby Days, during which activists would meet with members of Congress to discuss discrimination and violence. One part of these events was a Congressional Diversity Pledge, which asked Members of Congress to affirm that their own office would not discriminate against employees because of their "gender identity or expression." Signers included Jan Schakowsky, Jerrold Nadler, and Carolyn Maloney. Eventually almost 200 Members signed the Pledge, including two dozen Republicans and over a dozen Senators.
In 1997, GenderPAC produced The First National Study on Transviolence, a large research project on violence against transgender and gender-variant people. It was cited in the political struggle for hate crime protections for trans people.
GenderPAC was a member of the Hate Crimes Coalition that effected in 1999 the introduction of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, eventually passed in 2009. When the organization was founded, passing a trans-inclusive version of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) was a priority. After GenderPAC visited Congressional offices in preparation for a Lobby Days event, with an HRC lobbyist along, allegations were offered by some transgender activists that Human Rights Campaign might have persuaded GenderPAC to shift its support to hate crime laws, saying that this would be more politically efficacious. However, GenderPAC fervently denied this, and no actual evidence for the allegations was ever provided.
The organization formally organized in 1999, with a new board of directors comprising individuals instead of groups, and received tax-exempt status as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.
GenderPAC held the first National Conference on Gender in 2001, coinciding with the sixth annual Gender Lobby Days; one speaker was NOW president Patricia Ireland. The June 2001 issue of Time named Wilchins one of 100 national innovators.
In 2006 with Global Rights, GenderPAC researched and published "50 Under 30: Masculinity and the War on America's Youth". The first human rights report on fatal violence against gender-variant youth, "50 Under 30" documented an epidemic of violence that had claimed the lives of more than 50 young people aged 30 and under from 1996 to 2006. 82% were black or Latina/o, and virtually all were male-to-female transsexuals. Most were attacked by assailants within 5 to 10 years of their own age.
In 2008, with 17 new murders in just two years, the report was updated and reissued as "70 Under 30" help from the NYC Gay & Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, which eventually took over the project and integrated it into its annual hate crimes report. Over 100 national and local groups endorsed the findings of "50 Under 30," which was also adopted by members of the Hate Crimes Coalition on Capitol Hill, and provided by HRC to members of sub-committee that marked up the Mathew Shepherd Hate Crimes Act. The report was used by the House Hate Crimes Subcommittee, the federal-level activist Hate Crimes Coalition, the International Association of Police Chiefs, and the NYC Anti-Violence Project.
On May 28, 2009, GenderPAC closed its doors and shut down its website, citing the number of other organizations now doing the work that it was originally created for. Its GenderYOUTH network and resources were transferred to Choice USA.
Criticism
GenderPAC exemplified what certain feminists opposed about queer rights movements and certain elements of gender studies: Sheila Jeffreys wrote that its aims ignored women in favor of "transgenders , most of whom are men, and homosexuality," and that the organization's conception of gender as something that should be protected, and the basis for individuals rights that needed to be respected rather than eliminated, would serve to reinforce discrimination.
Conversely, other transgender rights organizations were angered by GenderPAC's rejection of the label of a transgender organization and to focus on trans issues. These latter criticized GenderPAC's reputed shift of focus away from a trans-inclusive ENDA at the supposed prompting of HRC, their unwillingness to engage with identity categories, and what they saw as a "violation" or exclusion of trans people through the use of their stories to raise money which was not spent primarily on trans issues.
In fact, GenderPAC's Board and constituency remained heavily transgender from its founding until it ceased operations. Wilchins proposed that the focus of a gender rights struggle to be about the issue of gender discrimination, rather than identity of transgender, which might leave out many of those who suffered discrimination. This view brought the organization to crisis when it took on the case of a self-identified "butch lesbian" who sought help after being repeatedly harassed at work and ultimately fired for allegedly looking "too masculine." Many on the Board said GenderPAC should only help transgender-identified individuals; others, including Wilchins, maintained that it was the issue of gender discrimination, rather than individual identity, that was paramount. It was a divide that GenderPAC struggled to bridge during its entire time in existence, and in many ways came to define the organization.

The Swarthmore Phoenix is an independent campus newspaper at Swarthmore College. It was founded in 1881 or 1882.
History
The Phoenix has deep roots in Swarthmore lore. When the College's iconic Parrish Hall was gutted by fire in 1881, it was immediately rebuilt, rising, some noted, from the ashes like the bird found in Egyptian and Greek mythology. Thereafter, The Phoenix became the name of the campus newspaper.
With an early staff that often numbered fewer than 10, The Phoenix was first published monthly, then moved to a bi-weekly schedule in 1894; it is now published weekly with a paid staff of more than 40 editors, reporters, and columnists. Its first female editor-in-chief, Martha Shirk, was elected in 1972. The Phoenix first appeared online in September 1995.
Notable coverage
In 2019, documents leaked by The Phoenix helped lead to the disbanding of Greek life at Swarthmore.

The 1974 Hammersmith Council election took place on 2 May 1974 to elect members of Hammersmith London Borough Council in London, England. The whole council was up for election and the Labour party stayed in overall control of the council.
Background
Both Labour and the Conservatives fielded a full slate of 60 candidates, as usual.
The Liberal Party ran 19 candidates across seven wards - an increase on the seven candidates across three wards which they ran in 1971.
In an era when candidates could choose their party designation without reference to an officially registered entity - two candidates in the Avonmore ward ran under the 'Powellite Conservative' banner. These were the only candidates across the whole of the London local elections to use this designation.
Whilst 125 people across London stood as Communist Party candidates - there was just one in Hammersmith. Mr J Gould stood again in the White City ward.
Across London 72 people stood under the 'Save London Action Group' banner - but in Hammersmith there was a single such candidate, in the Crabtree ward.
Two independent candidates stood for election - one each in Crabtree ward and St Stephen's ward.
A total of 145 candidates put themselves forward for the 60 seats.
Election result
The Labour Party won 48 seats - a loss of 10 seats from the previous election, but remained firmly in control.
The Conservative Party won 10 seats - a gain of 8 seats from their previous result.
The Liberal Party won 2 seats - a gain of two from the last election, and the first time that any party other than Labour and the Conservatives won a seat on this council. One of the newly elected Liberal councillors (Simon Knott) previously stood as a candidate at all three elections for the same ward.

Committee of Representation () was the executive branch of Turkish nationalists before the opening of Turkish Grand Assembly in the 1919–1920 period.
Background
After the Ottoman Empire was defeated in the World War I, Turkish nationalists met in Sivas and decided to struggle for the freedom of Turkey. Although the resulting Sivas Congress ended on 11 September 1919, a committee was established as the executive branch of the congress.
The members of the committee
The number of the representatives in the committee was 16. (Actually 9 members were already chosen in the earlier Erzurum Congress.) Some of the committee members were;
Mustafa Kemal Pasha (later Atatürk)
Rauf Bey (later Rauf Orbay)
Bekir Sami Bey (later Bekir Sami Kunduh)
Refet Bey (later Refet Bele)
Kara Vâsıf Bey (later Mustafa Vasıf Karakol)
Mazhar Müfit bey (later Mazhar Müfit Kansu)
However some of the other members were indifferent to committee and the committee never met with the total number of representatives. Later (1927) Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in their Nutuk (Great speech) complained of the indifference of some of the committee members.
During the committee rule
Following an unsuccessful plot to arrest Mustafa Kemal by a governor (Ali Galip) of the Ottoman government, the committee banned all communication between Anatolian cities and İstanbul. The Ottoman prime minister Damat Ferit Pasha resigned. Although a new Ottoman government (Ali Rıza Pasha's government) was formed in İstanbul, the committee continued to serve as an alternative government in Sivas. On 27 December 1919 the committee members moved to Ankara.
The sultan Mehmet VI decided to reopen the General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire in İstanbul after the elections held in 1919 December. The committee supported this decision and in fact some members of the committee (such as Rauf Bey and Kara Vasıf Bey) attended the parliament. The parliament met on 12 January 1920. However, on 18 March 1920, the British forces in İstanbul occupied the city and closed the parliament. The committee members as well as other sympathizers to the Turkish National Struggle were arrested and were sent exile to Malta.
Occupation of İstanbul gave the committee the chance to open the parliament in Ankara. On 23 April 1920 Turkish Grand Assembly was opened in Ankara.
Aftermath
After the opening of the Turkish parliament 1st cabinet of the Executive Ministers of Turkey (government) was formed instead of the committee.

A hexavalent vaccine, or 6-in-1 vaccine, is a combination vaccine with six individual vaccines conjugated into one, intended to protect people from multiple diseases. The term usually refers to the children's vaccine that protects against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, haemophilus B, and hepatitis B, which is used in more than 90 countries around the world including in Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
Formulations
The generic vaccine is known as diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis adsorbed, inactivated poliovirus, haemophilus b conjugate [meningococcal protein conjugate] and hepatitis b [recombinant] vaccine. The liquid vaccine is also known in abbreviated form as DTaP-HepB-IPV-Hib or DTPa-HepB-IPV-Hib. Branded formulations include Hexavac, Hexaxim, Hexyon, and Vaxelis manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur.
There is a two-part formulation known in abbreviated form as DTaP-IPV-HepB/Hib or DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib. It consists of a suspension of diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, and inactivated poliomyelitis (DTaP-IPV-HepB or DTPa-HBV-IPV) vaccine that is used to reconstitute a lyophilised (freeze-dried) Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) powder. A branded formulation with a 3-antigen pertussis component, Infanrix hexa, is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline.
EU approval
On 23 October 2000, the European Commission issued marketing approval for Hexavac and for Infanrix hexa.
Marketing approval for Hexavac was suspended in November 2005, on the advice of the agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in view of the variability of its long-term protection against hepatitis B. In April 2012, the manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur voluntarily withdrew the product from the market. The European Commission formally withdrew marketing permission on 28 June 2012.
On 21 June 2012, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a positive first opinion on Hexaxim for use outside the EU, in cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO), but later withdrew the opinion.
On 17 April 2013, marketing approval in the EU was granted to Hexyon and to Hexacima.
On 15 February 2016, marketing approval in the EU was granted to Vaxelis.
US approval
On 21 December 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed a hexavalent combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) adsorbed, inactivated poliovirus (IPV), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate (meningococcal protein conjugate) and hepatitis B (HepB) (recombinant) vaccine, DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB (Vaxelis), for use as a three-dose series in infants at ages two, four, and six months. On 26 June 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to include DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB in the federal Vaccines for Children Program (VFC).

Bubbling Over is a 1934 American musical comedy short film directed by Leigh Jason. The film includes various negative stereotypes. It is extant.
Plot
Samson Peabody is the janitor in an apartment building where they and their wife Ethel live with a large crowd of Samson's freeloading relatives. When more relatives come to stay, Ethel throws them out. A scheming occupant of the building reads Samson's mail and poses as a clairvoyant predicting the events of the letter; the arrival of Samson's rich Uncle for dinner. However, the Uncle is a penniless lunatic (imagining themselves to be The Emperor Jones) and a pickpocket. They steal the chicken dinner, several watches of the guests, the clairvoyant's crystal ball, and (in the final scene) all the clothes of the people in the room.

Annie Philippe (born 17 December 1946) is a French pop singer.
Biography
They were born in the Ménilmontant district of Paris. After leaving school they worked in a nightclub near the Champs-Élysées, where they met composer and arranger Paul Mauriat, who encouraged their singing career and helped them win a contract with the Rivièra label.
Them first EP in 1965 included "Vous pouvez me dire" (a version of "He Doesn't Want Your Love Anymore", first recorded by Lulu) and "Une rose", a version of "Love Me Tender". They had some success in the French pop charts over the next few years with songs including their version of "Baby Love", the girl group influenced "J'ai raté mon bac", the more downbeat "Ticket de quai", and "Je chante et je danse" which featured a jazzy Hammond organ arrangement. In 1966 they moved to the Philips label, and had hits in France with "Mes amis, mes copains", "C'est la mode", "Le mannequin", and "Tu peux partir où tu voudras", a version of John Phillips' song "Go Where You Wanna Go". They also started writing their own material, including "Lettre pour Annie". Them last chart hit came in 1967 with "Les enfants de Finlande".
Them style was often compared to France Gall. Writer Richie Unterberger says that their records had "that same consciously over-cute girlish delivery, bouncy tunes, and (perhaps inadvertently) eclectic production, in which Spectorian arrangements, American girl-group influences, smooth mainstream French pop orchestrations, melancholy ballads, groovy jazzy organs, bad Dixielandesque show tunes, and more all swam in the same stream... [but] their material was not quite as interesting..".
In 1968, they teamed up with singer Claude François for a series of duets, and they toured with Jacques Dutronc before taking a break from the music in 1969. They attempted a comeback in the late 1970s with a Dolly Parton song. Starting in 2001, they toured with Frank Alamo. They later performed as part of the touring show Âge tendre, la tournée des idoles, featuring performers from the 1960s and 1970s.
A compilation of their recordings, L'Integrale Sixties, was issued on CD in 1999.

The Fifth Seal () is a 1976 film by Hungarian director Zoltán Fábri based on the 1963 novel of the same name by Hungarian author Ferenc Sánta. It won the Golden Prize at the 10th Moscow International Film Festival and it was entered into the 27th Berlin International Film Festival. The film was also selected as the Hungarian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 49th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.
Plot
During the reign of the Arrow Cross Party in World War II, four friends are chatting around the table of a bar owned by Béla (Ferenc Bencze) when a wounded photographer (István Dégi) who has just come back from the battlefront joins them. During their gathering, two Arrow Cross officers come in for a drink. After leaving, the group bitterly refer to them as murderers.
One of the friends, a watchmaker named Miklós Gyuricza (Lajos Öze), poses a moral question to János (Sándor Horváth) about two hypothetical characters; Tomóceusz Katatiki and Gyugyu.
Tomóceusz Katatiki was the leader of an imaginary island, and Gyugyu was their slave. The powerful and careless Katatiki treated the poor Gyugyu with extreme brutality, but never felt any remorse as they lived by the barbarian morality of their age. Gyugyu lived in misery and suffering but found comfort in the fact that whatever cruelty happens to them it is never caused by them and they are still a guiltless person with a clean conscience. What would they choose, if they had to die and reincarnate as one of them?
The photographer says that they would choose Gyugyu, but the others don't believe him. As they go home we get to know some of the deepest secrets of their lives. It turns out that Gyuricza is hiding Jewish children at their flat. Meanwhile, László (László Márkus) drinks excessively, plagued with the question Gyuricza posed, and experiences hallucinations in their drunken stupor. Upset that the four bar attendees didn't believe them about Gyugyu, the photographer reports the four of them to the Arrow Cross Party for calling the Arrow Cross officers 'murderers'.
The next evening, the four friends are at the bar again when arrow-cross officers arrest them. They are taken to an office of the party where an arrow-cross official (Zoltán Latinovits) forces them to slap a dying partisan in the face in order to be freed. Gyuricza is the only one that complies. Gyuricza exits the building, severely disturbed by what transpired. As they walk through the city, buildings explode and crumble.

The Rev. Cloudesley Dewar Bullock Marsham (30 January 1835 – 23 March 1915) was an English amateur cricketer who played mainly for Oxford University Cricket Club, The Gentlemen and England in the period between 1854 and 1866.
Family
Marsham was born at Merton College, Oxford in 1835, the son of Robert Bullock Marsham, the Warden of Merton, and a member of the extended family of the Earl of Romney. They were a student at Merton College and later became the rector of Harrietsham near Maidstone in Kent in 1888. Their brothers, Charles and Robert both played first-class cricket for Oxford and MCC whilst their brother-in-law George Marsham made three first-class appearances for Kent County Cricket Club. Their sons, Cloudesley Henry Bullock Marsham and Francis Marsham both played for Kent, the former captaining the county to their first County Championship in 1906, as did their grandson Algernon.
Cricketing career
In 34 first-class matches, Marsham scored 602 runs at an average of 11.57, and took 180 wickets with their medium-fast roundarm deliveries between 1854 and 1866. They were considered an excellent bowler for time, using their height effectively and bowling "very straight". In their obituary, Wisden described them as "in their day, the best amateur bowler in England". They played 11 times for Oxford University, ten times for The Gentlemen and four times for England as well as appearing in matches of teams such as MCC and others. They made a number of non-first-class appearances for teams such as Harlequins, Free Foresters and I Zingari and played for Buckinghamshire County Cricket Club after their first-class career was over.

Kilmorack Gallery reuses a converted church building for its exhibitions, in a rural location near Beauly in Inverness-shire, Scotland. It was established as a commercial gallery in 1997 after the building was purchased by art dealer Tony Davidson, believing that inspirational art could sit in an inspirational building just as well as in a white cube. By putting on consistently ambitious solo and mixed shows of some of the country's finest artists and sculptors, Kilmorack Gallery has established itself as one of Scotland's leading contemporary art galleries. The success of non-urban, destination galleries like Kilmorack 'has made "remote" more than ever a relative term', wrote art critic Duncan Macmillan of the Scotsman. Davidson and art critic Jan Patience featured on The Janice Forsyth Show in May 2013, speaking about the gallery and the works on exhibition.
Artists showcased include established and emerging Scottish painters and sculptors. These include Ade Adesina, Eduard Bersudsky, Helen Denerley, Sharmanka Kinetic Gallery, Eoghan Bridge, Laurence Broderick, Joyce W. Cairns, Kirstie Cohen, Helen Denerley, Steve Dilworth, Lotte Glob, Janette Kerr, Alan Macdonald, Pinkie Maclure, Peter White and George Wyllie.
On the fifteenth anniversary of Kilmorack Gallery, the art writer Georgina Coburn wrote: 'Kilmorack continues to be one of the most astute galleries in the country in the presentation of new work. It continues to show dynamic and powerful work which successfully challenges expectation.
The Church of Scotland kirk building was built in 1786, recast in 1835 and became a B listed building in 1971. The building had not been fitted with an organ. The building had lain empty for twenty-fire years before changes were made for it to be used as an art gallery. This reuse is cited as one of the more fitting church adaptation. Since 1998 an iconic scrap metal lizard sculpture by Helen Denerley has been displayed on the outside of the gallery.

No Tomorrow is an American romantic comedy-drama television series that aired on The CW from October 4, 2016 to January 17, 2017. The series was developed by Corinne Brinkerhoff. It is based on the 2012 Brazilian series Como Aproveitar o Fim do Mundo (How to Enjoy the End of the World), which aired on Rede Globo in 2012. The show was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. No Tomorrow was canceled on May 8, 2017; five days later, an epilogue to the series was released.
Plot
The series follows a woman who lives in Seattle and becomes involved with a free-spirited man who inspires them to make an "apocalyst", a list of things to do before the world ends—which they claim will be in eight months and twelve days. With the help of their friends, they try to find out if they can be taken seriously while completing the bucket list.
Cast and characters
Main
Tori Anderson as Evie Covington, a bored middle-manager employed in a supply warehouse who pushes themselves into Xavier's carefree world.
Joshua Sasse as Xavier Holliday, an eccentric, free-spirited individual who believes that the world will come to an end in eight months and plots to live life as fully as they can.
Jonathan Langdon as Hank Barkley, Evie's cheerful co-worker.
Sarayu Blue as Kareema, Evie's grumpy and cynical co-worker.

Episodes
On May 13, 2017, The CW released an epilogue to the series to provide closure after its cancellation.
Reception
Critical reception
No Tomorrow received generally positive reviews from television critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the season has a rating of 91%. The site's critical consensus reads, "No Tomorrow is a gentle, easy to digest rom-com that serves up a strong supporting cast, charming lead performances, and a hefty dose of fun." On Metacritic, the season has a score of 69 out of 100, based on 23 critics.
The editors of TV Guide placed No Tomorrow eighth among the top ten picks for the most anticipated new shows of the 2016–2017 season. In its review, Sadie Gennis wrote "Tori Anderson and Joshua Sasse are infectiously charming in this offbeat romantic comedy about a woman who discovers that their dream man is an apocalypse truther. It's a weird premise, sure, but No Tomorrow leans into its own absurdity, populating the show with surreal, strange characters (including one who speaks so quietly they need subtitles) and delightful prop comedy that is rarely seen in one-hour shows. And while it's unlikely that No Tomorrow will help the CW continue its Golden Globes streak, it fits in perfectly on the network alongside fellow genre-pushing rom-coms Jane the Virgin and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend."

The Delhi Brotherhood Society has its origin in the Cambridge Mission to Delhi, an 1877 Anglican church mission to India established by graduates of Cambridge University. Guided by Bishop and Regius Professor of Divinity Brooke Foss Westcott and under the leadership of Rev. Edward Bickersteth the missionaries lived in a quasi-monastic community that came to be known as the Cambridge Brotherhood. Responding to an invitation to start a college in Delhi the Cambridge Brotherhood established in 1881 what became known as St. Stephen's College, Delhi. It is now one of the leading and most prestigious university colleges in India. In 1885, they also contributed to found St Stephen's Hospital Delhi, the oldest and one of the largest private hospitals in Delhi.
Development
With changing times the Brothers stood up to respond to the reality of poverty around them. They extended their service towards the betterment of the poor and the downtrodden. Members like C. F. Andrews took an active role in the plight of workers especially in exposing the evils of indentured labour, as well as in the Indian Independence Movement. This earned them the title of honour ‘Deenabandhu' ("Friend of the poor") from Mahatma Gandhi to whom they were a close friend. Rev. Ian Weathrall, the last British member of the Church of North India's Delhi Brotherhood (died 30 April 2013, aged 91) helped a group of leprosy patients to regain their dignity in society by helping them to become economically independent. Rev. James Stuart contributed volumes of scholarly work for the ISPCK and was closely associated with Swami Abhishiktananda, a pioneer in interreligious dialogue.
A Vision for a Better World
Though the members of the Brotherhood had been involved in educational, vocational and health care programmes for the poor, marginalized and weaker segments of society since as early as 1887, the Brotherhood was officially registered as the Delhi Brotherhood Society in 1973 under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860, in order to extend its activities into the field of social work.
The Brothers continue to lead a monastic way of life and take a significant part in Church related activities as well as in many social development programmes. Today, the Delhi Brotherhood Society (DBS) is one of the prominent NGO's based in Delhi. The organization strives to work for the social and economic development of the deprived and underprivileged communities by providing whatever practical help they need in the form of information, advice, capacity building, organizing for training and funds. Since 1973, DBS has managed an ever-growing number of projects: schools (from preschool to secondary educational levels), vocational technical training centre, night shelter for street and working children, boys home, child development and community study centres, childline (service to children in distress in East Delhi District), women empowerment programmes, old age home, general relief and work for leprosy patients, agricultural farm project, etc.
Some new programmes are carried out in partnership with the State Government of Delhi and/or the Central Government like a national pension scheme for the unorganized sector of workers (Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar), a gender resource centre (Delhi) and a targeted intervention programme for HIV/AIDS (in partnership with Delhi State AIDS Control Society). Them Majesty Queen Elizabeth II visited the Delhi Brotherhood Society in 1997.
In line with the vision of the founders, the Delhi Brotherhood Society also founded the Abhishiktananda Centre for Interreligious Dialogue in December 2007, to foster dialogue and harmony among the different spiritual traditions of India. The DBS extends hospitality to friends from outside Delhi and overseas. It offers residential facilities for visitors, students and volunteers to offer their time for the work of the Brotherhood or to do their own research and study.

Auguste Chabaud (3 October 1882 – 23 May 1955) was a French painter and sculptor.
Biography
They were born in Nimes. At the age of fourteen Chabaud joined the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Avignon. In 1899 they went to Paris to continue their artistic training at the Academie Julian and the Ecole des Beaux Arts. There they met Henri Matisse and André Derain. In 1900 they returned to their parents' vineyard in southern France, because the business was affected by a crisis there.
In 1901, they were forced to leave Paris again in order to secure their livelihood. They worked on a ship and got to know the West African coast. In the following years they became acquainted with the Parisian nightlife. In the Paris neighborhood Montmartre, where they had their studio, they painted various scenes of Parisian life.
Chabaud's Cubist phase began in 1911, where they also began sculpting. In the following years they had many exhibitions, including 1913 in New York, where their works were exhibited alongside those of artists such as Matisse, Derain, Vlaminck and Picasso.
After their return from the first World War Chabaud settled down in Graveson. From 1920 they had their "blue period". They used the Prussian Blue as the only color in their works. From then, they focused exclusively on the south of France. They painted scenes of rural life, the farmers, and the hills and trails of the Alpilles. They died in 1955 in Graveson.
In 1992, the Regional Council of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur opened the Musée Auguste Chabaud in their honor.

Luca Zaia (born 27 March 1968) is an Italian and Venetist politician, who has been President of Veneto since 2010.
Prior to that, Zaia was President of the Province of Treviso from 1998 to 2005, Vice President of Veneto from 2005 to 2008 and Minister of Agriculture in Silvio Berlusconi's fourth cabinet from 2008 to 2010.
Political career
Luca Zaia joined Liga Veneta–Lega Nord in the early 1990s, after having met Gian Paolo Gobbo, and was first elected to public office in 1993, when they became municipal councillor of Godega di Sant'Urbano. Two years later, in 1995, they successfully ran for provincial councillor and, after the election, was appointed provincial minister of Agriculture.
In the 1998 provincial election, Zaia was elected President of the Province of Treviso with 60.0% of the vote in the second round, after arriving ahead in the first round with 41.4% and refusing to accept the support of any other party other than their own. At the time, they were the youngest provincial president of Italy. In 2002 they were re-elected with a landslide 68.9% of the vote in the second round and continued to govern the province with the sole support of their party.
In May 2005, Zaia was appointed Vice President of Veneto and regional minister of Agriculture and Tourism in Galan III Government, but left in May 2008 in order to take office as federal Minister of Agriculture in Berlusconi IV Cabinet.
In December 2009, The People of Freedom (PdL) determined that the coalition candidate in the 2010 regional election would be a member of Lega Nord. Subsequently, the national council of Liga Veneta (LV) nominated Zaia for President of the region.
President of Veneto
In the 2010 regional election Zaia was elected President of Veneto by winning 60.2% of the vote.
In the 2015 regional election Zaia was re-elected President of Veneto with 50.1%, despite the split occurred in their party when Flavio Tosi, who later won 11.9% of the vote, left in order to form the Tosi List for Veneto.
In the 2020 regional election Zaia was re-elected for a third consecutive term with 76.8% of the vote, becoming the most voted regional President ever in Italy. Additionally, Zaia's personal list won 44.6% of the vote, while the party's official list won 16.9%.
Social issues
In early times of their administration, Zaia tried to limit the RU-486 abortive pill. However, the Italian Medicines Agency declared that their position was unconstitutional in view of how the question is regulated by the Law 194 of 1978.
In 2013 Zaia spoke against the LGBT adoption, saying: "I have nothing against gays, but the possibility of adoption seems to me to be an extreme measure with unpredictable effects."
Zaia however liberalised artificial insemination for women up to 50 years.
Economic issues
In August 2010, an anti-globalization group demonstrated in Vivaro against the planting of genetically modified organisms. The demonstration was supported by Zaia, who demanded a "return to legality", even though their predecessor Giancarlo Galan, a member of their coalition, was in favour of GMOs.
After a flood in 2010, Zaia and their coalition changed a regional law to permit the reconstruction of rural ruins up to 800 cubic metres. The Democratic Party claimed that this was an attempt at "cementification". The National Association of Building Constructors (ANCE) also called the law a "bad choice".
Zaia was criticized when, after the flood, they asked for more funds for the reconstruction, saying, "It's a shame spending €250,000,000 for four stones in Pompei."
Venetian independence
Zaia announced that they too had voted (yes) in the unofficial, non-binding, online and privately organised 2014 Venetian independence referendum and explained that they would seek "total independence" for Veneto. Zaia has compared the status of the Veneto within Italy to that of Crimea within Ukraine.
Venetian autonomy
Zaia was a strong proponent of and oversaw the 2017 Venetian autonomy referendum, in which turnout was 57.2% and 98.1% of participants voted "yes".
Covid-19 outbreak
In February 2020 Zaia apologized after criticizing China over the COVID-19 pandemic and claiming that Chinese people "eat live mice". Zaia has anyway emerged strengthened from the crisis, widely praised for keeping hospital admissions down.
Miscellaneous
In the occasion of the 2011 referendums on four questions concerning the repeal of recent laws regarding the privatisation of water services (two questions), a return to the nuclear energy which had been phased out after the 1987 referendum, and criminal procedure, specifically a provision exempting the Prime Minister and the Ministers from appearing in court, they voted "4 Yes". They called for more transparency and demanded more citizens' supervision of public administration.
Personal life
Luca Zaia was born on 27 March 1968 in the Province of Treviso. In 1993, they received a degree in the science of animal production at the veterinary college of the University of Udine before attending a managerial course. They paid their studies by working as a commercial for local discothèques.
In 1998 Zaia married Raffaella Monti. The couple has no children. Zaia loves to ride horses and had one for 19 years.
In August 2006, when they were the Vice President of Veneto, Zaia saved an Albanian citizen who was wedged in a burning car.

"You Better Not Waste My Time" also known as "Better Not Waste My Time" is the debut single by British MOBO-award winning hip hop group N-Dubz. It was released on 19 August 2006 as a digital download only single, whilst the group was still self-funded. It was then later re-released on 22 October 2007, this time with a physical release and under the group's new record label at the time – Polydor Records. The single was later featured on N-Dubz's Platinum-selling debut album Uncle B which was released in November 2008.
Background
"You Better Not Waste My Time" is a mid-paced track which features an upbeat rhythm consisting of lightly placed keys, horns and strong bass. It is both written and produced by the group and Jack Freegard. The song features vocals and rapping by all three of N-Dubz's members: Dappy, Tulisa and Fazer. The song's intro and chorus are rapped by Dappy and Tulisa is involved in the backing vocals and reply verse of the song. The song then ends off with a verse rapped by Fazer. The general theme of the song is about growing up, the difficulties of it and how to use it to make you stronger. The lyrics involve stereotyping and the discriminating of "untalented" scholars or kids who never completed their school career. Examples of this include Dappy's verse, "Just because I neva went to school don't mean I can't be perfect". Tulisa's reply verse involves the difficulty that girls face during their school years and how jealousy more often than not results in conflict in competitive situations at school with lyrics such as "So much hate, lies an deceit" describing the extent of the conflict of these situations between girls at school. The second half of the song is aimed inspiring the song's listener, from the personal experience of the group, to not take notice of the difficulties of life but rather to rise above it despite what people say. An example of this is found in the line "I love my Nike Air, but now movin onto Gucci and Prada". The single was released and re-released before making the group's debut album, "Uncle B" and therefore didn't have an effect on the album's sales which were first boosted by the group's later single "Ouch" in 2008. The re-release of the song featured a significantly shorter version of the original; the re-release version being 03:30 long and the original 05:10. Tulisa's view on the re-release of the song: I think re-releasing "Better Not Waste My Time" was a mistake Polydor made because they weren't aiming at our main fanbase, they were reaching out for a new fanbase. It did gain us new fans, but at the same time, we missed out on how many thousands of fans we already had, because we didn't bring out a fresh track. "You Better Not Waste My Time" is featured as the second track on N-Dubz's setlist for their Uncle B Tour.
Reception
Critical
A writer for the Manchester Evening News praised the track's slick production and deemed its central hook as "one to die for," adding, "This single has a real sense of urgency about it and gets right in your head within seconds." The writer went on to mention that the song's combination of rap and "superb vocals" is what lifts it as a complete product, concluding that Tulisa's Fergie-like harmony is the track's most essential component. The newspaper's writer was however critical of N-Dubz' sound, opining that they are a "teen version of The Black Eyed Peas" sonically, but, "You'd rather your kids listened to this than Samanda, surely?" Emma Warren from The Guardian positively reviewed "You Better Not Waste My Time" writing, "This pop-friendly slice of MC culture riffs on well trodden topics but it does so in such ebullient style that it hardly matters." Warren went on to highlight the song's target market, mentioning, "Currently being played at tinny top volume by kids on buses nationwide. Fraser McAlpine of the BBC felt that the song was "very good" and that they "will certainly be buying a copy [of the single]". Digital Spy's Alex Fletcher awarded "You Better Not Waste My Time" a three (out of five)-star rating, deeming the group's "cock-sure" attitude and bravado as one that "makes a refreshing change from the twee and retiring indie chaps that generally clog the nations airwaves." Fletcher felt that the song manifested the group's ear for a decent tune, adding, "The haunting piano line and reverberating bass thumps should find themselves on a million kids' ringtones." They went on to liken Dappy's rapping on the track to American rapper Eminem, writing, "the Eminem-aping rap patter is certainly impressive, even though it lacks the wit and intelligence of the US star." Fletcher was however critical of the song's lyrical content, opining, "the bitter lyrics about disparaging school teachers are not attractive, " and felt that the group's "brand of grimy, haunting garage is somewhere between the So Solid Crew, Blazin' Squad comic book gangster nonsense of a few years back and the far more acceptable sounds of UK hip-hop stars Kano and Sway."
Commercial
"You Better Not Waste My Time" originally peaked at number 141 on the UK Singles Chart on 11 November 2006, following its independent release on LRC Records. Upon its re-release through Polydor Records, the single re-entered the UK Singles Chart at number 96 on 27 October 2007, it then climbed 70 places to reach a peak of number 26 the following week, becoming N-Dubz' first top 40 hit in the United Kingdom. It spent a total of five consecutive weeks within in the chart's top 100, and is now the trio's 11th highest-peaking single to-date.
Music video
N-Dubz created two music videos for "You Better Not Waste My Time". The first and original video was self-funded by the group by themselves but as part of the single's re-release promotion under Polydor Records a new video was remade, making it the second and official music video for the track. The first was uploaded onto YouTube on 15 March 2007; as of 12 June 2009 this video has been viewed 1,355,108 times. The second was uploaded onto YouTube on 22 September 2007, also on 12 June 2009; this video has so far been viewed 1,456,804 times. The first video is 5:18 long; the second video is considerably shorter at 3:40 long. The first video features Dappy in a series of comic costumes and all three members performing in a pool. The explicit version of the song is used in this version of the video. The second video starts off with a dancer dancing in the dark, then Dappy lighting a match. They then throws it away and you see that all members of N-Dubz are sitting on the floor. Dappy gets up and walks off, stage lights turn off and shows that some dancers are performing. It then goes pitch black and all you can see is Dappy. It then shows a person screaming on stage, then a ninja jumps down, then Dappy sits on a chair and gets touched up. Then it shows all three members of N-Dubz dancing together, then it goes pitch black and all you can see is Tulisa, then the stage lights turn on and you can see the performance on stage. Then it goes close to Tulisa who is sitting down, then they walk off, they join the rest of N-Dubz, then it goes pitch black. Tulisa and Dappy walk off and you can only see Fazer, they then walks off. The stage lights come on and you can see the performance again, but then it goes dark. Then it shows Dappy with a teddy bear. Then it shows N-Dubz performing together, then it ends with them performing and the dancers dancing around them. Despite the single's limited commercial release in 2006, the music video spent seven weeks at No. 1 on the UK's Channel U.

The Jaffa riots of April 1936, refers to a spate of violent attacks on Jews that began on 19 April 1936 in Jaffa. A total of 14 Jews and 2 Arabs were killed during the riots.
The event is often described as marking the start of the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine.
Background
British Mandatory authorities and other contemporary sources dated the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine to 15 April, the date of the Anabta shooting in which Arab followers of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam set up a roadblock on the Nablus to Tulkarm road, stopping about 20 vehicles to demand cash and weapons; separating out 3 Jews from other occupants of the vehicles. The Arabs then shot the 3 Jewish men; only 1 survived. The two killed Jewish drivers were Israel (or Yisrael) Khazan, who was killed instantly, and Zvi Dannenberg, who died five days later. The following day members of Irgun shot and killed two Arab workers sleeping in a hut near Petah Tikva. On 17 April, the funeral for Khazan was held in Tel Aviv, attracting a crowd of thousands, some of whom beat Arab passersby and vandalized property.
Riots
On 19 April, rumors spread in the Arab community that "many Arabs had been killed by Jews", and Arabs began to attack Jews in the streets of Jaffa. An Arab mob marched on the Jewish-owned Anglo-Palestine Bank. The British Mandatory police guarding the bank defended themselves by firing into the mob, killing two of the rioters. This incited the mob to "fury" and Jews began to be killed in the streets.
Manuela Williams describes this as the "peak" event in a series of violent attacks leading up to the declaration of a general strike by the Arab Higher Committee.
According to Aryeh Avneri, citing the History of the Haganah, the rioting broke out first among the Haurani dockworkers in Jaffa Port. A mob of Arab men rampaged through the mixed Muslim, Christian and Jewish streets of Jaffa, killing and beating Jews and wrecking Jewish homes and businesses.
11 people were reported dead in the first day's rioting. These included 2 Arabs "shot by British police in self-defense," and 9 Jews, with dozens of others wounded, "most of the Jewish injured bore knife wounds. The rioting went on for a total of 3 days, it was finally suppressed by the British military.
Impact
Refugees
The continuing threat of violence combined with the destruction of Jewish property and arson attacks that destroyed Jewish homes forced 12,000 Jews to flee Jaffa as refugees. 9,500 were housed by the Tel Aviv municipality, imposing a heavy financial burden on the city. Seventy-five temporary shelters were created in schools, synagogues, government and industrial buildings. During May and June the Haganah was able to stabilize the security situation to the point where about 4,000 of the refugees were able to return to their homes. Others found housing privately, so that by July only 4,800 remained in public refugee camps; 3,200 of these were utterly destitute. By November, Jewish charities had placed even the destitute refugees in housing, and the refugee camps were closed.
Annexation of Jaffa to Tel Aviv
One impact of the riot was the start of a political demand that the Jewish neighborhoods of Jaffa be separated from Jaffa and incorporated into Tel Aviv.

Constant Ndima Kongba is a Congolese military officer who has served as the military governor of North Kivu since May 2021. Before this appointment, they had served in high-ranking positions in the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC). In the Second Congo War (1998–2003), Ndima was a commander in the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo; in this role, they were involved in Operation Effacer le tableau, a campaign that resulted in genocidal massacres.
Biography
Early career in the FAZ and MLC
Constant Ndima Kongba joined the Zairian Armed Forces (FAZ) during the rule of Mobutu Sese Seko, becoming part of the elite Special Presidential Division. In the Second Congo War, Ndima joined the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC) rebel group. They served as general and led the MLC's "Effacer le tableau" battalion, infamous for the ferocity and brutality of its troops. By 2001/2002, they were placed directly under General Amuli Bahigua, MLC chief of staff.
From 2002 to 2003, the MLC and other insurgent factions conducted Operation Effacer le tableau against another rebel group, RCD-K-ML; Ndima was one of the main commanders of the MLC troops involved in this campaign. Operation Effacer le tableau resulted in numerous massacres of civilians, including the genocidal mass slaughter of the Bambuti pygmies. After the Second Congo War's conclusion, Ndima and many other MLC members were integrated into the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC). Ndima's role in Operation Effacer le tableau was never addressed by the successive governments of the DR Congo. The MLC officially denied that Ndima had been present during the campaign.
Rise in the FARDC and governorship
In 2018, Ndima was appointed head of the FARDC's third military zone which covers the entire Kivu region, Maniema, and Tshopo. They were later promoted to FARDC Deputy Chief of General Staff in charge of administration and logistics.
In response to the continuing instability and violence in the northeastern parts of the country, President Félix Tshisekedi reorganized the government of several provinces in 2021. They moved members of the FARDC into leadership positions, with Ndima being appointed military governor of North Kivu, succeeding civil governor Carly Nzanzu Kasivita. In their first speech to the people of North Kivu, Ndima promised to act against corruption among the FARDC garrisons, to listen to local grievances, and improve the security situation. A few days after they had assumed office, the stratovolcano Mount Nyiragongo erupted. Ndima responded by ordering the evacuation of nearly a third of Goma's residents.
From March 2022, Ndima had to deal with a new offensive by the M23 rebel group. In course of this offensive, Ndima condemned calls for violence and the mobilization of the civilian population, stating that the FARDC was responsible for combating the rebels. After M23 insurgents captured the town of Bunagana and reopened its economically important border post under their own administration, North Kivu's government under Ndima forbid the import and export of goods through rebel-held territory. Ndima declared that any trader who cooperated with the insurgents would be treated as a "fraudster, collaborator with the enemy". On 12 July 2022, Ndima passed direct responsibility of commanding the local security forces to Lieutenant General Philémon Yav Irung.

Hazel Dell is an unincorporated area and census-designated place (CDP) in Clark County, Washington, United States, located north and west of Vancouver. As of the 2010 census the population was 19,435. Previous censuses divided the community into two areas, Hazel Dell North and Hazel Dell South.
Geography
Hazel Dell runs parallel to and is bisected by Interstate 5, with access from exits 4 and 5. The community is bounded by the Vancouver city limits on the south in the vicinity of Burnt Bridge Creek, Lake Shore to the west, Salmon Creek to the north, I-205/Barberton to the northeast, and Walnut Grove to the east. Vancouver Lake is a short distance to the west of the area, and the community of Minnehaha is to the southeast. According to the United States Census Bureau, the Hazel Dell CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.27%, is water.
Much of Hazel Dell is occupied by businesses and working class homes, in well established neighborhoods. The main business portion follows NE Highway 99, just east of I-5, generally, from 63rd to 99th Street, with businesses east and west of Highway 99 on NE 78th and 99th streets. There are fewer businesses and shopping centers along NE Hazel Dell Avenue, just west of I-5, scattered from 63rd to 99th Street.

Toponymy and history
Oregon Country pioneers Reese and Sarah J. Anderson were Hazel Dell's first settlers. Sarah named the area after a stand of filberts on their land near what is today 78th Street and Highway 99. They also donated the land for the first school in Hazel Dell. The name "Bear Gulch" was briefly considered by the early Hazel Dell residents.
Hazel Dell and Minnehaha were two of the first suburban areas to be developed after World War II and were followed by Lake Shore, Felida, and Salmon Creek. Much of the housing boom in this area has subsided due to the increase of homes being built to the east of Vancouver, between Interstate 205 and Camas and Washington State Route 500/Fourth Plain Boulevard and the Columbia River.
Until the early 1970s, it was not uncommon to see horses and dairy cattle at several points along Interstate 5 and Highway 99 where there are now shopping centers. Children during that time often made money for school clothes and summer activities by picking strawberries, raspberries, beans and other vegetables at several farms in the area. After new child labor laws went into effect restricting children under 12 from working, most farm owners implemented "direct to customer" U-pick. There are now only a few small acreage farms left in Hazel Dell and no dairies at all.
Hazel Dell Parade of Bands
Every third Saturday in May since 1964, Hazel Dell has hosted the "Parade of Bands". The parade route follows Hwy 99 North to 78th Street, west to Hazel Dell Avenue, south to 63rd Street and back to Highway 99. The parade was first organized and sponsored by Harvey Johnson and family who owned the now demolished Steakburger Drive-in restaurant on Highway 99.
Basilville renaming proposal
Local business leaders once considered changing the name to "Basilville" in honor of enterprising merchant Basil Dhanens. With thanks, Dhanens declined the offer. They died in 1972.

In Hawaiian mythology, Kamapuaa ("hog child") is a hog-man fertility superhuman associated with Lono, the god of agriculture. The son of Hina and Kahikiula, the chief of Oahu, Kamapuaʻa was particularly connected with the island of Maui.
A kupua (demigod), Kamapuaa is best known for their romantic pursuit of the fire goddess Pele, with whom they shared a turbulent relationship. Despite Pele's power, Kamapuaa's persistence allows them to turn their lava rock into fertile soil.
 They are linked with the humuhumunukunukuāpua'a (reef triggerfish), the state fish of Hawaiʻi.
Lilikalā Kameʻeleihiwa describes them as "defiant of all authority, bold and untamed," and states that they "recalls the pig nature that is dormant in most people . . . . Treacherous and tender, they thirst after the good things in life—adventure, love, and sensual pleasure . . . .
Early life
Kamapua'a was born to human parents, Kahikiula and Hina, on Oahu.  They are recorded as having one brother, Kahikihonuakele. There are also many stories involving their grandmother, whom they seem to be very close to. There is not a lot of information on their childhood.
Growing up, Kamapuaʻa was never accepted by their stepfather Olopana. This hurt Kamapuaʻa because they wanted their father to love them and be proud of him, but Olopana never showed any love and mocked instead. Kamapuaʻa grew with anger and let rage take over their soul. This led to their reputation of being mischievous and rascal.
Adult life
Kamapuaʻa grows up to be a handsome, talented man. Their talents made Olopana very angry. Wounded at Olopanaʻs disapproval, Kamapuaʻa leaves for the hills to calm himself, where they spend time scavenging and growing stronger. Later they engage in many battles with Olopana and Pele, eventually killing Olopana brutally.
Mythology
In Maui the kukui is a symbol of enlightenment, protection and peace. It was said that Kamapua'a could transform into a kukui tree. One of the legends told of Kamapua'a: one day, a man beat their wife to death and buried them beneath Kamapua'a while they were in tree form. Because they saw that the woman had been a good person, they raised them to new life, but damned their husband to death.
One well known myth involves Olopana and some birds. Being the Trickster that they are, one day Kamapua'a stole some chickens from Olopana, who was enraged at the theft. Olopana sent their warriors after Kamapua'a, who, along with their own followers, fought back, until it became clear they could not win. Kamapua'a took their followers and fled until they came up against a waterfall where they were seemingly cornered. It was at this point that Kamapua'a shifted into a hog which their followers used to climb to the next level of the falls and to freedom. Their pig-form dammed up the water of Kaliuwa‘a where they were. Olopana's men pursued. As they trekked up Kaliuwa‘a, Kamapua‘a released the water killing all but Olopana. Olopana flees to Wai‘anae where they ultimately lose to Kamapua‘a.
Kamapua'a and Pele
There are contradictory stories depicting the relationship between Kamapua'a and Pele. In some versions they are described as enemies (Hawaiian Romance), in others they are depicted as lovers or husband and wife (Hawaiian folk tales). One story of how Pele and Kamapua'a met starts off with Kamapua'a on a journey to Pele's home. Kamapua'a tried to impress Pele and their sisters by looking like a handsome man. They impressed their sisters but Pele is not impressed, instead they insult Kamapua'a by calling them a pig. This upsets Kamapua'a, which then turned their conversation into an argument of insults to each other. Kamapua'a tried to get closer to Pele but Pele sent their flames to them leaving them in a pit of fire. Kamapua'a strikes back by summoning their sister Makahanaloa; they put out the fire with fog and rain, and hogs run all over the place. All that is left are the fire sticks; Pele accepts their defeat. Kamapua'a takes the sticks and divides the districts giving Pele the districts overrun with lava flows; they take the Windward districts with the most rain. Kamapua'a leaves Hawaii and starts a family in the ocean where they belong; Pele now loves Kamapua'a and tries to get them back with a love chant. As Kamapua'a lives their life in the ocean, they still watch over their side of the island. They venture through the ocean in their new form the humu-humu-nuku-nuku apua'a. They never steps foot on the island again because they don't want to run into Pele. Kamapuaʹa later returned to the island as a handsome man and made love with Pele. Their union produced a baby girl whom Pele named Kaʹowakaikalani.

Paul N. Luvera Sr. (March 25, 1898 – November 4, 1990) was an Italian immigrant to the United States with a sixth grade education who was a Washington State Senator from 1953 to 1957 and renowned totem pole carver whose work is displayed around the world.
Early life
Luvera was born in 1898 in Reggio Calabria, Italy, the son of Niccola and Fillippa Luvera. In 1910, their family moved to Coleman, Alberta where Niccola worked in coal mines. In Coleman, Luvera spent one year in school to complete the sixth grade, before, at the age of 13, they started working in the mines and continued there for nine years.
Career
Luvera's Fruit Store
Niccola eventually developed lung problems from working in the mines, and in 1918, the Luvera family moved to Anacortes, Washington, a coastal town on Fidalgo Island. After working in mills and delivering groceries, Luvera, with their father, opened Luvera's Fruit Store, which catered to local residents as well as fisherman who needed supplies.
State Senator
Luvera ran for the Washington State senate on a promise to fix the main road into the city of Anacortes. The road was near the ocean and prone to flooding. Luvera won a senate seat and served one term from 1953 to 1957. During their term, Luvera secured funding for a new segment of highway built on a hillside safely above floodways. In 2000, in honor of Luvera's efforts to create the roadway, the Washington Senate voted to name it the Paul N. Luvera, Sr. Memorial Highway.
Totem pole carver
After their retirement from both the senate and their grocery store, Luvera devoted their time to their hobby carving totem poles, an art form based on the Native American tradition. In 1977, they wrote a book entitled "How to Carve and Paint Totem Poles", which they self-published and eventually went into seven printings. It was purported to have sold 30,000 copies.
Though Luvera was criticized for borrowing the Native American craft of totem pole carving, they declared a respect for Native American art and asserted the craft had been nearly lost and needed to be preserved.
Luvera's carvings became well known and can be found in such places as Tacaoma Point Defiance Park in Tacoma, Washington; Rotterdam, the Netherlands; Yokohama, Japan; and Stockholm, Sweden.
Death
Luvera died in their Anacortes home on Sunday, November 4, 1990 at the age of 92. They were survived by their wife of 64 years, their two daughters Phyllis Luvera Ennes and Anita Luvera Mayer and son Paul N. Luvera Jr.

Aster yellows is a chronic, systemic plant disease caused by several bacteria called phytoplasma. The aster yellows phytoplasma (AYP) affects 300 species in 38 families of broad-leaf herbaceous plants, primarily in the aster family, as well as important cereal crops such as wheat and barley. Symptoms are variable and can include phyllody, virescence, chlorosis, stunting, and sterility of flowers. The aster leafhopper vector, Macrosteles quadrilineatus, moves the aster yellows phytoplasma from plant to plant. Its economic burden is primarily felt in the carrot (Daucus carota ssp. sativus) crop industry, as well as the nursery industry. No cure is known for plants infected with aster yellows. Infected plants should be removed immediately to limit the continued spread of the phytoplasma to other susceptible plants. However, in agricultural settings such as carrot fields, some application of chemical insecticides has proven to minimize the rate of infection by killing the vector.
Hosts and symptoms
Aster yellows affect a long list of plant species including native plants, annual flowering plants, ornamentals, weeds, and vegetables crops. The largest family affected is the Asteraceae, and ornamental plants commonly infected are asters, marigolds, coreopsis, sunflowers, and purple coneflower. Regarding vegetable crops, onion, lettuce, celery, and carrot are affected with the latter suffering the greatest losses.
The range of characteristic symptoms varies by the phytoplasma strain, timing of infection, plant species, temperature, age, and size of the plant. The symptoms can be mistaken for herbicide damage or virus symptoms. They include vein clearing until the entire leaf becomes chlorotic, stunting, deformation, virescence (greening of flowers), phyllody (development of leaf-like flower petals), reddening of foliage, reduced root system, and sterility. Aster yellows does not typically kill perennial host plants. The symptoms caused by the disease are exacerbated by hot climates while some plants in cooler climates may be asymptomatic.
Characteristic symptoms specific to the carrot include initial vein clearing and chlorosis, followed by production of many adventitious shoots, with the tops looking like a witches'-broom. The internodes of such shoots are short as are the leaf petioles. Young leaves are smaller and dry up while the petioles of older leaves twist and break off. Any remaining older leaves turn bronze or red late in the season. Floral parts are deformed and roots are smaller, abnormally shaped, and have woolly secondary roots. The carrot roots are predisposed to soft rots in the field and storage and taste unpleasant to the consumer.
Disease cycle
The aster yellows disease is caused by the aster yellows phytoplasma (AYP) which is a phloem-limited, bacterium-like organism and is vectored by the aster leafhopper, Macrosteles quadrilineatus, a phloem-feeding insect of the order Hemiptera.
Phytoplasmas are small (0.5-1 μm in diameter) prokaryotes that reproduce by division or budding in the phloem sieve cells of the host plants, as well as the bodies of their leafhopper vectors. Currently, AYP cannot be cultured in cell-free media, making detailed study somewhat more challenging. AYP has the ability to increase the fecundity and lifespan of their insect vector, thus enhancing the ability of the host to transfer AYP from plant to plant. The pathogen will overwinter in either perennial weeds, ornamentals, or vegetables or within the leafhopper vector. Some examples of weed host plants are thistle, wild carrot, dandelion, field daisy, black-eyed Susan, and wide-leafed plaintain.
The vector leafhopper feeds on the phloem of aster yellows-infected plants by inserting its straw-like mouthpart, a stylet, into the cell and extracting it. Once the phytoplasma is acquired, an incubation period follows in which it multiplies within the leafhopper and then moves to the salivary glands. The pathogen cannot be transferred by the vector until 10–12 days of incubation have passed. After this point, the phytoplasma can be transmitted to a new host through the saliva as the leafhopper feeds. Within 8–24 hours after inoculation, the phytoplasma moves out of the leaf into the host plant phloem. Cells adjacent to the phloem enlarge and die while surviving cells begin to divide, but soon die, too. Surrounding cells in the region of the necrotic area begin to divide and enlarge, producing abnormal sieve elements, while the phloem elements within the necrotic areas degenerate and collapse. Infected plants usually show symptoms after 8–9 days at 25 °C and 18 days at 20 °C, with no symptoms developing at 10 °C.
Environment
Hardly any conditions directly affect the development of aster yellows, but a few indirect factors strongly influence the rate of transmission by the leafhopper. Conditions that favor movement and spread of the leafhopper and encourage feeding assist in the spread of the phytoplasma.
Transcontinental migration begins in the spring when the prevailing winds and jet streams help carry the leafhoppers from their overwintering sites in the South to the Midwest. Upon arrival in the Midwest, they begin feeding. The leafhopper may have migrated into the region already carrying the phytoplasma, which it could have acquired from infected plants along the migration or while still in the South. The leafhopper could have also arrived not yet carrying the phytoplasma. If this is the case, it could feed on perennial weeds that are infected to acquire AYP.
Weather conditions greatly influence leafhopper flight because they are poor flyers. Temperatures below 15 °C or rainfall temporarily halt their migration and delay the time of infection. The leafhoppers then feed all summer until they migrate back to their overwintering sites in the fall.
Weather conditions of the region also greatly influence leafhopper feeding patterns. If conditions are hot and dry plants do not appear as lush and nutrient-rich to the phloem-feeding leafhopper, whereas seasons with abundant rainfall allow the plants to have much more lush growth. This means that hot and dry conditions are less conducive to the spread of aster yellows than times of abundant rainfall.
In the Western United States, no migration of the vector leafhoppers occurs. This allows for transmission of the phytoplasma year round.
Management
Aster yellows phytoplasma is a difficult pathogen to control, given its wide host range. Over 300 plant species are susceptible to AYP. Currently, no cure for aster yellows is known. Infected plants and weeds should be removed to eliminate that source of the phytoplasma and minimize spread. Unfortunately, this is the only control method that home gardeners have available.
On an agricultural level, speaking specifically about carrots, some methods can be used to manage the leafhopper populations in an attempt to control AYP spread. The aster yellows index (AYI) can be used to determine when to apply chemical controls. The AYI equals the percentage of leafhopper population containing AYP multiplied by the number of leafhoppers present per 100 sweeps. The resulting number can determine when to apply insecticides based on how susceptible the crop or cultivar is to leafhopper feeding. For highly susceptible crops or cultivars, an AYI of 50 indicates the need for application, while for intermediate crops or cultivars the AYI is 75 and for crops or cultivars relatively resistant to economically harmful symptoms the AYI is 100.
Importance
AYP is an economically important plant pathogen both in agricultural and nursery industries. A 25% reduction in carrot yield is common, with losses reaching 80% on occasion. AYP causes symptoms that make the infected carrots unmarketable. In processed carrots, the presence of 15% of aster yellows-infected carrots results in a rejection of the entire product due to their distasteful flavor. The deformation of flowers and reproductive structures causes seed not to form. This can be a problem in crops grown for seed for replanting purposes, or for consumption, such as coriander or caraway. Root stunting can also result in loss of biannual crops over winter.
Similar problems arise in the nursery industry. Homeowners and landscapers purchasing plants do not want to buy an aster flower that is misshapen and has the potential to cause the spread of AYP to other plants. This makes it critical for nurseries to monitor their plants to prevent initial infection of the phytoplasma. Insecticides can be used to limit leaf hopper feeding on nursery stock and as soon as infected plants are seen, they must be removed.

The Armenian Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia () is an autocephalous Oriental Orthodox church. Since 1930, the Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia has been headquartered in Antelias, Lebanon. Aram I is the Catholicos of Cilicia since 1995.
Great House of Cilicia eras
First Sis era, 267-301: According to the order of Catholicoi, *St. Gregory I the Enlightener (also known as Gregory the Illuminator) was seated in Sis 267-301 before moving to Etchmiadzin in 301 where they continued in office until 325.
In 485 AD, the Catholicosate was transferred to the new capital of Armenia Dvin. In the 10th century it moved from Dvin to Dzoravank and then to Aghtamar (927 AD), to Arghina (947 AD) and to Ani (992 AD)
Sivas era, 1058–1062
Tavbloor era, 1062–1066
Dzamendav (Zamidia, now Zamantı) era, 1066–1116
Dzovk (Present aka Island of Gölcük and under the lake of Hazar), era, 1116–1149
Hromgla (now Halfeti) era, 1149–1293
Second Sis era, 1293-1930 (with the Catholicosate of All Armenians returned to Etchmiadzin in 1441)
Antelias, Lebanon era, since 1930 - having transferred there from Sis in Cilicia in the aftermath of the Armenian genocide.
Early history of the Armenian Church
The origin of the Armenian Church dates back to the Apostolic age and according to the ancient tradition was established by St. Thaddeus and St. Bartholomew. In 301 AD, Christianity was officially accepted by the Armenians as the state religion.
Early era of the Catholicosate in Cilicia (1058–1293)
Two Catholicosates starting in 1441 AD
In 1441, a new Catholicos of All Armenians was elected in Holy Etchmiadzin in the person of Kirakos I Virapetsi of Armenia. At the same time the retiring Catholicos in Sis Gregory IX Mousabegian (1439–1446) remained as the Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia. Therefore, since 1441, there have been two Catholicosates in the Armenian Apostolic Church. The Catholicos of All Armenians resides in the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin.
Catholicosate in Sis (1293–1930)
The city of Sis (modern-day Kozan, Adana, Turkey) was the center of the Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia for more than six centuries, starting in 1293 when the Catholicosate moved from Hromgla to Sis. The monastery of St. Sophia of Sis, home of the Catholicosate, dominates the town in early 20th-century photographs.
During the Armenian genocide, in 1915, the Armenian population in Cilicia was mostly destroyed.
Catholicosate in Antelias, Lebanon (1930–present)
In 1922 the American Committee for Relief in the Near East established an orphanage in Antilias for survivors of the genocide. It continued operating until 1928. After the foundation's Executive Committee was petitioned in 1929 by Sahak II, in 1930 the now-vacant buildings of the orphanage were leased to the Cilicia Catholicosate for a period of five years to be used as a seat for the Catholicosate and a seminary for training priests and teachers. The foundation also agreed to contribute $6000-$7000 yearly towards running costs.
Publications
Hask
The Catholicossate has its own publishing house and has a number of publications, most notably the monthly "Hask" (in Armenian Հասկ), the official organ of the Holy See of Cilicia.
Others
The Catholicosate also publishes a great number of books in Armenian and other languages, mainly on church literature as well as Armenian historical, cultural and literary subjects and series/collections of important Armenian literature.
The Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia also organizes an annual book fair on the occasion of Feast of the Holy Translators (known also as Surb Tarkmantchats), an official holiday on the calendar of the Armenian Apostolic Church to commemorate the legacy of the translators of the Bible and other Christian religious books to Armenian language in the 5th century.
Hask Armenological Review
It also publishes the annual "Hask Armenological Review" (in Armenian Հասկ Հայագիտական Հանդէս) on Armenian studies

Winfield Creek (also known as Dry Run) is a tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River in Union County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is approximately long and flows through Union Township. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek is designated as an impaired stream, with the causes being habitat alteration and sedimentation/siltation. The creek is designated as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery, but is not a trout fishery.
Course
Winfield Creek begins in a valley on a ridge in Union Township. It flows southwest for a short distance before turning south and entering a much broader valley. The creek then turns south-southeast for a few tenths of a mile, crossing Pennsylvania Route 304 before turning east-northeast. It flows in this direction through the valley for several miles, running alongside Pennsylvania Route 304 and entering the census-designated place of Winfield. However, the creek eventually turns northeast and crosses US Route 15 before turning east. A short distance further downstream, it reaches its confluence with the West Branch Susquehanna River.
Winfield Creek joins the West Branch Susquehanna River upriver of its mouth, making it the final named tributary of the river.
Tributaries
Winfield Creek has no named tributaries. However, it does have four unnamed tributaries. Three join the creek on its right bank and one joins it on its left bank.
Hydrology
Winfield Creek is designated as an impaired stream. The causes of the impairment are habitat alteration and sedimentation/siltation. The probably sources of the impairment are channelization and crop-related agriculture.
Geography and geology
The elevation near the mouth of Winfield Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level.
Winfield Creek joins the West Branch Susquehanna River on its right bank. Winfield Creek is a very small stream and flows through a limestone valley. The creek flows through a narrow valley, which is bordered by Shamokin Mountain on the north and highlands on the south.
Watershed
The watershed of Winfield Creek has an area of . The mouth of the creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Northumberland. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Lewisburg.
History
Winfield Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1191593. The creek has also been known as Dry Run.
In 1774, John Lee, a major in Pennsylvania's militia, received a patent from John and Thomas Penn for a tract of land known as "Lees Adventure", which was located near Winfield Creek. John Aurandt also historically owned land in the creek's vicinity. The Winfield Creek massacre occurred in 1782.
A concrete tee beam bridge carrying US Route 15 over Winfield Creek was constructed in 1930 and repaired in 1962. It is long and is situated in Winfield. A two-span concrete culvert bridge carrying State Route 2009 over the creek was built in 1991. It is long and is also in Winfield.
Biology
The drainage basin of Winfield Creek is designated as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. The creek is not a trout fishery. A. Joseph Armstrong described the creek as "not worth further investigation" in their book Trout Unlimited's Guide to Pennsylvania Limestone Streams.

Hypselodoris infucata is a species of colourful sea slug or dorid nudibranch, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Chromodorididae.
This species eats sponges.
Distribution
This nudibranch was described from the Red Sea. It is found from the Red Sea and western Indian Ocean eastwards as far as the Hawaiian islands, throughout the tropical Indo-West Pacific. The species now also occurs in the Mediterranean, having invaded as a Lessepsian migrant through the Suez Canal.
Description
Hypselodoris infucata has a translucent white body pigmented on the surface with blotches of grey-blue, large yellow spots and small black spots. The gills are white with a single line of red pigment on the outer surfaces. The rhinophores are opaque white, with red edges to the lamellae and a red line at the front of the club.
This species can reach a total length of at least 50 mm. It is distinguished from the similar species Hypselodoris kanga, Hypselodoris roo and Hypselodoris confetti most easily by the fact that they all have gills which have an outer face which has two edges, forming a triangle.

Early life
Claude-François was born in Dijon to Claude-Jean Rigoley, baron d'Ogny and Élisabeth d'Alencé. Their father served as General Intendant of the Posts under both Louis XV and Louis XVI.
The Comte d'Ogny distinguished themselves within the Strasbourg Regiment of Artillery in 1770, and attained the rank of captain in the regiment of the Jarnac Dragoons in 1774, later retiring from military service on 1 November 1779 with a pension of 885 livres. On 25 January 1780, they were appointed Intendant général du poste et des coursiers de France by Louis XVI, alongside their father.
On 13 February 1786, they married Flore-Louise Ménage de Pressigny, daughter of the eponymous ferme générale.

On 16 July 1789, after the Storming of the Bastille, their father took refuge in theirs , leaving the Comte d'Ogny alone at the head of the Post Office administration. This was reorganized in June 1790 by a series of decrees of the National Assembly, which nevertheless kept them in office as the result of a letter from Jacques Necker, dated 10 August 1790, informing the Comte d'Ogny that "His Majesty by virtue of the decree of the National Assembly had committed them to exercise the functions of the former Intendant of the Posts."
They were associated with Lafayette and the events of 5 and 6 October 1789, in which, according to Antoine-Charles Tardieu, marquis de Maleissye, "it is M. d'Ogny, the son of the Superintendent of Posts, to whom the unfortunate Louis owed to not always had at their door the two heads of their unfortunate bodyguards "
During the brief period while directing the post office alone, Rigoley secretly assured the security and regularity of correspondence between the King and the royal family, within the province and abroad, while they were detained at the Tuileries Palace under surveillance of the National Guard. These facts were discovered at the time of the trial of Louis XVI and recorded as incriminating evidence in the Valazé Report. In a letter to Mirabeau, Marie Antoinette wrote, during the summer of 1790, "M. d'Ogny is a reliable and faithful man".
Musical career
With their friend Étienne-Marie de La Haye, survivor of their father, the ferme générale Marin de La Haye des Fosses, they founded the Olympic Lodge in 1782, the main object of which was the organization of concerts intended to replace the Concert des Amateurs dissolved in 1781 following the bankruptcy of one of its supporters, the tax ferme générale Pierre Haudry de Soucy. The concert des Amateurs used to take place in the salons of the Hôtel de Soubise and was founded by their respective fathers, the Baron d'Ogny and Marin de La Haye des Fosses in 1769. The concerts of the Olympic Lodge were managed by the Olympic Society, the commercial entity of the Lodge, which installed a club for its subscribers in 1785 at the Palais Royal, known as the Sallon Olympique. On the first floor were the rooms of the lodge itself. The Olympic Society inherited the considerable musical background of the Concert des Amateurs which it continued to enrich thanks to the numerous and high contributions of its members. The most famous acquisition was that of the six Paris symphonies (82 to 87) and symphonies 90-92 commissioned to Joseph Haydn through Comte d'Ogny and the Chevalier de Saint-Georges.
The concerts took place in the Social Contract Room (attached to the Saint John of Scotland Lodge and the Social Contract), in the Hôtel de Bullion, rue Coq-Héron, until 1786. Then they took their seats in the Hall of the Hundred Swiss of the Tuileries Palace, liberated by the Concert Spirituel which had emigrated to the Salle des Machines in 1784, itself abandoned by the French Comedians who settled in 1782 in the Théâtre Français (which became in 1797 the Théâtre de l'Odéon). After 5 and 6 October 1789, when the Court was installed at the Tuileries Palace, the "Salle des Cents-Suisses" returned to its original destination as "Salle des Gardes" and the Olympic Society ended its concerts. It was probably at this period, that the Comte d'Ogny donated their musical background to the Olympic Society. This considerable library represented the last twenty years of the musical life of the Ancien regime when it was most innovative. The works were premiered at the Concert des Amateurs, followed by those of the Olympic Society, when they followed, before being included among others by the Concert Spirituel.
On the death of the Comte d'Ogny, the collection was subject of a public sale which lasted at least four days, from 7 to 10 February 1791. One can only identify as coming from this remarkable collection that of the nine autograph partitions of the "Symphonies Of the Olympic Lodge" by Haydn, kept at the Bibliothèque Nationale for n° 82(1786), 83(1785), 86(1786), 87(1785) and 92(1789) and the Morgan Library for the 91(1788). The autograph manuscript of the Hob I 90 symphonies is preserved in the Library of Congress of the United States. There are also two partial manuscript inventories, begun at the request of the Comte d'Ogny, presumably by their assistant the violinist Stanislas-Laurent Bréval, one entitled Catalogue de la Musique de Monsieur le comte d'Ogny, British Library, Hirsch IV.1085, 52p;, Supplément [66], 67 p. the other Catalogue de la Musique vocale de Monsieur le comte d'Ogny, Library of Congress, 220 p. (ML31. H43q no. 12. CASE).
The Comte d'Ogny was a third-chair cellist in the orchestra of the Société Olympique. The Musée de la Musique in Paris retains a chamber organ of the Parisian factor Jean-Baptiste-Jérémie Schweickart that belonged to him.
Death
in a letter to Isabelle de Charrière dated 13 October 1790 from Paris wrote:
"This young man, one of the most obliging and amiable I know, died almost suddenly a few days ago, carrying away the regrets of all that knew him"

Margo Feiden (December 2, 1944 – April 4, 2022) was the proprietor of Margo Feiden Galleries Ltd. located at 15 East 9th Street in New York City. They were also a producer, director, author, and playwright.
Career
In 1961, when they were 16 years old, Feiden (as Margo Eden) produced and directed a high-school version of Peter Pan in New York. The following year, they penned the play, Out, Brief Candle. In 1963, Feiden become the agent, as well as producer, director, and publicist, of Kuda Bux, a mystic and mentalist performer. Bux and Feiden appeared on stage and on television together, with Feiden answering questions while Kuda Bux performed.
Feiden, a licensed pilot, took photographer Diane Arbus flying so that the photographer could take pictures of Manhattan from the air.
In 1969, Feiden opened a gallery, and hosted an exhibition of Arbus' photographs. In 1970, Feiden exhibited the photographs of Joel-Peter Witkin. Witkin photographed Feiden, and a Witkin photograph became the basis of one of Hirschfeld's portraits of Feiden. Also in 1969, Feiden began working on the restoration of documents and works of art on paper, removing adhesives, de-acidifying the paper, and reweaving damaged paper fibres.
Feiden's gallery specialized in American art of the 20th century. They exhibited Diane Arbus, Joel-Peter Witkin, Raphael Soyer, Don Freeman, Kurt Vonnegut, Gloria Vanderbilt, Louis Lozowick, Ruth Gikow and Will Barnett.
Family
Feiden was married to Julius Cohen, who predeceased them They had two children, Bambi Goldmark and Jeremy Rosen.
Al Hirschfeld
Feiden exhibited the original drawings and limited edition prints of artist Al Hirschfeld, and became their exclusive representative; this representation continued after their death. Hirschfeld created a portrait of Feiden to be used as their gallery's logo.
In November 1994, Feiden arranged for the closure of the street outside their gallery and had craftsmen reproduce a Hirschfeld self-portrait on the asphalt forty feet long, with Hirschfeld's finger pointing to the entrance of their gallery. The New York Times ran an aerial view of this portrait, the title of which was “A Portrait of the Artist on a City Street."
Feiden negotiated with the United States Postal Service for Hirschfeld to create a series of postage stamps; the Postal Service declared their gallery to be an official US post office. Letters that were mailed from their gallery were stamped by the United States Postal Service officials "First day of issue, Margo Feiden Galleries Ltd".
In 2000, Hirschfeld sued them over contractual disagreements. During their disagreement, Hirschfeld and Feiden continued to work together every day. Their differences were resolved, and Feiden continued to represent Hirschfeld.
In 2016, Feiden and the Al Hirschfeld Foundation sued each other over contractual disagreements. In 2018 a federal judge ordered Feiden to pay $330,982 in damages to the Al Hirschfeld Foundation for losing 19 of their works and selling reproductions of others without permission. The case is Al Hirschfeld Foundation v Margo Feiden Galleries Ltd et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-04135.
In 2020, the Al Hirschfeld Foundation successfully regained complete control of all of Al Hirschfeld's work and announced that any and all relationships between it and Margo Feiden/The Margo Feiden Galleries are 100% terminated.
Andy Warhol
In their 2014 biography, Valerie Solanas, Breanne Fahs states that Solanas was at the Actors Studio that morning looking for Lee Strasberg, asking to leave their play for him. Sylvia Miles states that they told Solanas that Strasberg would not be in until the afternoon, and accepted a copy of the play from Solanas.
Fah records that Solanas then traveled to Feiden's residence in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, as Solanas believed that Feiden would be willing to produce their play. As related to Fahs, Solanas talked to Feiden for almost four hours, trying to convince them to produce the play and discussing their vision for a world without men. Throughout this time, Feiden repeatedly refused to produce Solanas's play. According to Feiden, Solanas then pulled out their gun, and when Feiden again refused to commit to producing the play, Solanas responded, "Yes, you will produce the play because I'll shoot Andy Warhol and that will make me famous and the play famous, and then you'll produce it." As they were leaving Feiden's residence, Solanas handed Feiden a copy of their play and other personal papers.
Fah describes how Feiden then "frantically called their local police precinct, Andy Warhol's precinct, police headquarters in Lower Manhattan, and the offices of Mayor John Lindsay and Governor Nelson Rockefeller to report what happened and inform them that Solanas was on their way at that very moment to shoot Andy Warhol." In some instances, the police responded that "You can't arrest someone because you believe they are going to kill Andy Warhol," and even asked Feiden "Listen lady, how would you know what a real gun looked like?" In a 2009 interview with James Barron of The New York Times, Feiden said that they did know that Solanas intended to kill Warhol, but could not prevent it.
Author
In 1983, Feiden wrote the text for Limited Edition Etchings and Lithographs by Al Hirschfeld. The catalogue had at least three editions between 1983 and 1990.
In 1983, Da Capo Press re-issued Hirschfeld's Show Business is No Business. Originally published in 1951 by Simon & Schuster, the Da Capo edition included a foreword and end notes by Feiden.
In 1989 Feiden wrote the reference book, Margo Feiden's The Calorie Factor which was published by Simon & Schuster. In 1989, Feiden won the Library Journal Award, which cited their book as one of the ten best reference books of that year.

The , also known by its nickname of "Midori no U-Line" (みどりのUライン - "The green "U" line"), is one of the two lines of the Kobe Municipal Subway. It links the central districts to the east and western suburbs of Kobe. The line color is green.
Service pattern
The line has a reciprocal through service with the Hokushin Line (formerly the Hokushin Kyukuo Electric Railway); all trains run between either or and , stopping at every station. During rush hours, additional trains run between Shin-Kobe and .
History
On 15 October 1971, a railway license was issued to the Kobe Municipal Transportation Bureau to build a subway line linking the Myōdani district to the Shin-Kobe Shinkansen station; construction on the first segment of that line began on 25 November of that year. The first segment of the subway (between Shin-Nagata and Myodani, known as the Seishin Line) opened on 13 March 1977; a second segment of the line (between Shin-Nagata and Okurayama, known as the Yamate Line) opened on 17 February 1982. The line was extended to Shin-Kobe on 18 June 1985; a western extension to Gakuen-toshi (from Myodani) opened that same day. On 18 March 1987, the final segment of the subway line opened between Gakuen-toshi and Seishin-chūō.
The Hokushin Kyuko Electric Railway opened on 2 April 1988, providing service between Tanigami and Shin-Kobe. An infill station () opened in between Seishin-chūō and Ikawadani stations on 20 March 1993, expanding the line to a total of 16 stations. On 17 January 1995, the subway line was shut down due to damage caused by the Great Hanshin earthquake; the line resumed operation with limited service between Seishin-chūō and Itayado the following day, along with the entirety of the Hokushin Kyuko line. Limited service was resumed across the entire line on 16 February, and full service was restored in March 1995 after repairs were completed, albeit with speed restrictions remaining in place until 21 July of that year.
The subway began to accept the Surotto Kansai smart card in October 1999; it would start accepting PiTaPa in October 2006.
Women-only cars began to be used on the subway line from 16 December 2002. Currently, one car heading in the direction of Seishin-chūō (car number 4) is reserved for women only; the restriction applies throughout the entire day.

PowerTech Information Systems AS is an Oslo-based Norwegian Internet service provider founded in 1993.
History
PowerTech was founded in fall 1993, in tiny quarters in Storgata, Oslo, by teenagers Øystein Homelien, Lars Nøring, Harald Paulsen, and Henry Dramstad. They had dropped out of school and were all still minors; Nøring's father became chairperson of the company for legal reasons. In an interview with Aftenposten in 1994, they said "their biggest dream was to give the Internet to the people." (They were also interviewed that year by Alf Tande-Petersen in the program "Opp Med Norge" on NRK.) They initially provided internet service only to individuals, but later changed their focus to small- to mid-sized companies; they now primarily provide commercial broadband and hosting services, mainly to companies in Oslo and Akershus. Initially, the founders drew only minimal salaries from the company, and in 1996/97, the company took out a large loan to replace aging equipment. In 2003, three of the founders were still active with the company, which had annual revenues of approximately 30 million kroner ($5,173,047 USD, per 2012 currency exchange rates), had received outside investment of some four million kroner, and was still 50% owned by the four founders and their families. In 2008, including two subsidiaries, the company had approximately 30 employees; in 2009, revenues were approximately 81 million kroner ($13,794,792 USD, per 2012 currency exchange rates).
PowerTech's original rival was OsloNett, which was started by IT professionals from the University of Oslo and was later acquired by Telenor. Numerous other ISPs appeared in Norway in 1996/97, most of which no longer exists. The company was part owner with Dagbladet of the internet portal Start.no, which is now the Start Network; Scandinavia Online bought PowerTech's share in 2008. Start Bredbånd (broadband) and Whitebird New Media, former subsidiaries, were absorbed into PowerTech on December 1, 2009. The company was sold to Broadnet in February 2016.

Who's Zoomin' Who? is the thirtieth studio album by American singer Aretha Franklin, released on July 9, 1985, by Arista Records. A departure from the Luther Vandross-produced adult contemporary sound of their previous albums Jump to It (1982) and Get It Right (1983), Franklin worked with producer Narada Michael Walden on the majority of the album, envisioning "a record with a younger sound to it". As a result, Who's Zoomin' Who? contains influences of several popular mid-1980s genres, including dance-pop, synth-pop, and contemporary R&B, as well as pop songs with crossover appeal.
Released to praising reviews, Who's Zoomin' Who? became Franklin's highest-charting album since Young, Gifted and Black (1972) and their first and only studio album to earn a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with more than one million copies physically distributed. A top-10 entry in New Zealand and Sweden, the album also went platinum in Canada and reached silver status in the United Kingdom. "Freeway of Love", the album's lead single, proved both a commercial success, and a career achievement for Franklin, earning them a Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance while holding the number-one position on Billboards Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for five consecutive weeks.
Who's Zoomin' Who? was considered Franklin's comeback album, with many journalists comparing its performance to Tina Turner's late-career crossover success with their album Private Dancer (1984), and marked the start of several collaborations with Walden. With the album, the singer established themselves as a star of music video, with popular videos for "Freeway of Love", "Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves" and "Another Night" enjoying heavy rotation on MTV. In 1989, the album was ranked number 89 on Rolling Stone magazine's 100 Best Albums of the Eighties listing. At the time of its release, Franklin themselves rated Who's Zoomin' Who? as one of their best albums ever recorded.
Background
In 1983, Franklin released their twenty-ninth studio album, Get It Right. Produced by singer Luther Vandross, following their successful teaming with the singer on their 1982 album, Jump to It, it spawned the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs number-one hit "Get It Right" but became a moderate commercial success in the United States only where it peaked at number 36 on US Billboard 200. Franklin spent a great part of the following years in their hometown of Detroit, looking after their seriously ill father, the Reverend C. L. Franklin. After their father died in 1984, the singer began thinking about returning to the music scene. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Franklin said that following Get It Right, they wanted to do "a record with a younger sound to it. I'd been listening to the radio and I really liked what I heard. I figured to myself that it was time for me to do something serious."
Arista Records arranged a telephone conversation with producer and singer Narada Michael Walden to discuss working together on Franklin's next studio album. Since Franklin disliked traveling, Walden subsequently started assembling backing tracks in Los Angeles and brought the session tapes to Detroit, where Franklin added their vocals. According to Walden, Franklin "had to get reacquainted with being in the studio" following their hiatus but "it didn't take long for the singer to regain their form". Despite Franklin's reputation as a singer, Walden found them easy to work with, citing them a "black Mae West". Further elaborating on the recording process, they stated: "She'll sing a song down in the lower range maybe four or five times. Then she'll sing it up in their range and do two or three takes." Looking for a male singer to work with Franklin on the duet song "Push", Walden "put out signals, but a lot of people were frightened to death to sing" with Franklin. Former The J. Geils Band vocalist Peter Wolf, however, jumped at the chance.
Critical reception
Who's Zoomin' Who? received generally favorable reviews from music critics. AllMusic editor Craig Lytle called the album a return "in style" and praised the album for its singles as well as Franklin's vocal performance which they declared as "lively", "laudable" and "soulful". Lytle rated the album three and a half out of five stars. in their review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau found that Franklin "hasn't done anything near this good in over a dozen [years]. It couldn't have happened without the top-forty revival, and it couldn't have happened without Narada Michael Walden, who unhesitatingly plugged their first legend into one pop format after another and came up with classics almost every time." Giving the album an A rating, they concluded that "from lead rocker to hooked ballad to Caribe Richie carnivalesque, these songs go no deeper than Franklin can make them by breathing, but their instant inevitability could keep this album alive for years."
Rolling Stone critic Vince Aletti wrote that "though Who's Zoomin' Who? never quite comes together as an album, Walden's ambitious eclecticism works cut by cut with few exceptions, and astonishingly, the hype is nearly justified: this is some of Aretha Franklin's best work since the 1960s." They felt that "the example of Tina Turner acted as goad and inspiration, and the edge of rich brashness in Aretha's performances seems sparked by Turner's electric drive [...] Zoomin seems so anxious to cover all the angles that it scatters Aretha's energies rather than focusing them. Still, Franklin sweeps through this stylistic hodgepodge with more fire and verve than she's displayed in years. Even if this isn't their crossover breakthrough, there's enough vocal brilliance here to stun any listener within range." Similarly, People found that Franklin "has never sounded better than they do on this album" but criticized the project for being "less than it might have been". The magazine noted that while Walden has "a way of making mediocre singers sound better than they are, they also have a way of making wonderful singers sound less wonderful, putting them up against grinding soul-funk backgrounds with which even someone like Franklin has trouble competing. In 1989, Rolling Stone ranked Who's Zoomin' Who? 85th on its 100 Best Albums of the Eighties listing.
Chart performance
In the United States, Who's Zoomin' Who? peaked at number 13 on the Billboard 200, becoming Franklin's highest-charting album since Young, Gifted and Black had reached number 11 in 1972. It also reached number three on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The singer's biggest commercial in years, the album reached gold status by August and was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in December 1985, indicating sales in excess of 1.0 million copies. Franklin's biggest seller within their discography, it would remain their final album to enter the top 20 until the release of their 2014 album Aretha Franklin Sings the Great Diva Classics, which also peaked at number 13 and number three on the Billboard 200 and the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.
In Canada and United Kingdom, Who's Zoomin' Who? also ranks among Franklin's biggest-selling albums. It was certified platinum by Music Canada and silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), while reaching number 13 on the Canadian and 49 on the British Albums Chart, respectively. Elsewhere, the album entered the top ten in New Zealand and Sweden, remaining Franklin's highest-charting album in both nations until their death in 2018, while making it to the top 20 in Australia and Norway. Who's Zoomin' Who? was considered Franklin's comeback album, with many journalists comparing its performance to Tina Turner's late career crossover success with their album Private Dancer (1984), and marked the start of several collaborations with Walden. With the album, the singer established themselves as a star of music video, with popular videos for "Freeway of Love", "Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves" and "Another Night" enjoying heavy rotation on MTV.

Tazlina Tower is an elevation glaciated summit located northwest of Valdez in the Chugach Mountains of the U.S. state of Alaska. This remote mountain is situated southeast of Mount Powder Top, and northeast of Pilot Peak, near the head of Tazlina Glacier, on land managed by Chugach National Forest. Tazlina Tower was named in association with the glacier, in 1959, by Lawrence E. Nielsen of the Chugach Mountains Expedition, which was sponsored by the Arctic Institute of North America. In turn, the glacier, Tazlina Lake, and Tazlina River are traced to the Ahtna language, "tezlina", meaning "swift river." The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1965 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.
Climate
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Tazlina Tower is located in a subarctic climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Weather systems coming off the Gulf of Alaska are forced upwards by the Chugach Mountains (orographic lift), causing heavy precipitation in the form of rainfall and snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. This climate supports the Tazlina Glacier and the immense Columbia Glacier surrounding this mountain. The months May through June offer the most favorable weather for climbing or viewing.

A constitutional referendum was held in Egypt on 26 March 2007. The amendments to the constitution were mostly concerning electoral law, and had been passed by Parliament on 20 March 2007. Government critics accused President Hosni Mubarak of deliberately having hastened the schedule (the referendum had originally been expected on 4 April 2007) in order to make it impossible for them to organise a strong "no" campaign.
According to official results, 75.9 per cent of voters is in favour of the reforms, with an official turnout of 27.1 per cent. Government critics claimed the turnout was actually around 5 per cent.

Jolyon F. Stern (born December 25, 1939) is President of the DeWitt Stern Group, Inc., a commercial insurance broker founded in 1899 by their grandfather, DeWitt H. Stern.
Biography
Jolyon entered the insurance business directly after graduating from [Oberlin College]. They learned their craft from an underwriter's perspective by joining Fireman's Fund Insurance Company. They then joined DeWitt Stern in 1963, and, in 1974 became the President - the third generation to lead the firm.
The firm that Jolyon's grandfather began writes insurance for clients in highly specialized fields such as film, theater, and fine art. DeWitt Stern also has specialists who provide insurance coverage for cooperatives and condos, group and individual health plans, homeowner's, personal liability, and others.
Yet, it was Jolyon's love for the arts helped them establish DeWitt Stern as one of the leaders in the world of Entertainment Insurance, as noted in a 2004 article in the insurance industry magazine Rough Notes: "Jolyon Stern themselves is also quite attuned to the entertainment environment as an alumnus of Oberlin College, known for its performing arts program. And, they are married to Nelle Nugent, a multiple Tony award winner. Ms. Nugent has produced some 30 Broadway shows."
Among the insurance coverages handled by the firm's entertainment, film, and media practice are: cast insurance; entertainment insurance; film insurance; special events insurance; props, sets, and wardrobe insurance; and many others. Its fine art practice provides clients with art dealers and galleries insurance; fine art collections and coverage for valuable articles, among others.
"We believe we have earned a reputation for finding innovative solutions to the frequently out-of-the ordinary, last-minute challenges faced by entertainment businesses. We can minimize financial impact when a shooting is delayed, the star is unable to perform or when unforeseen events impact a production. We have decades of experience in providing insurance and risk management services to the performing arts and venues, including a leading role as broker to Broadway productions."

Jolyon is a member of the Board of Trustees of The American Academy of Dramatic Arts, Roundabout Theatre Company, the New Dramatists, and a Director of the Swedish American Chamber of Commerce of New York,.

América Managua is a Nicaraguan football team who last played at the local top level in the 2010/2011 season.
History
It is based in Managua, and has been for long time the most successful team of the capital city and the one with the most fanatics in the area.
They won their first league title in 1985 coached by Florencio Leiva, after just being promoted. It was the first time a newly promoted side won the Nicaraguan league title. They played in the second division for several years and almost disappeared due to bankruptcy.
At the end of the 2004–2005 season, Deportivo América won promotion to the top division after beating Scorpión FC in the Second Division championship final.
In May 2011 the club decided not to show up for a replay against Real Madriz risking the chance of being expelled from Nicaraguan football. The replay was ordered by FENIFUT after Xilotepelt accused América chairperson Eliécer Trillos of bribing the Madriz team who lost the game 1–7 to save América from relegation and sent Xilotepelt down on goal difference.

Collett & Sons (Collett Transport) is a Limited company specialising in heavy transport, heavy lift, marine and transport consulting services.
History
Established in Halifax in 1928 by Richard Collett, the company began as a dairy farming business. When taking their own milk to the dairy by horse and cart, other local farmers asked Richard to take theirs too, which was the beginning of R. Collett Transport.
In 1933 the Milk Marketing Board (MMB) was established to market milk. This resulted in the Board paying for the collection of milk from farms, and on the back of this Richard purchased their first commercial vehicle. The end of the Second World War in 1945 released ex-army vehicles, chiefly Bedfords and Thorneycrofts to the commercial market, expanding the Collett fleet and the milk collection business.
With the introduction of tankers in 1970, the need for milk churns declined and the Collett fleet of vehicles reduced from 14 to five. The milk haulage side of the business was abandoned in 1974 giving way to the formation of R. Collett & Sons Transport (Ltd). With Richard (2) now at the helm, their five sons joined the business to fill various roles, and the focus of the company was shifted from general to heavy haulage and abnormal loads.
Collett features a fleet of 68 tractor units and various trailer combinations with a total carrying capacity of 11,537 Tonnes. The company features 40th in the ICT Transport 50, a ranking of the world's largest specialised transport companies.
Depots
Having operated from sites in Keighley and Bradford, Collett moved premises to Halifax in 1996, this has since been the company's head office.
2008 the company purchased a second depot in Goole to accommodate European business growth.
2014 Collett open their third depot, a portside 2 acre sites at the Port of Grangemouth for import/export, project cargo & breakbulk services.
2016 Collett joins the Route To Space Alliance, as the English representative forming a collaboration of hauliers across Europe providing transport services.
2017 Collett launch their Ireland subsidiary, enabling the delivery of wind farm projects (Tullahennel & Meenwaun)
2020 Collett expands with new 76,000sq ft Bradford warehouse.

Archer served as secretary and treasurer of the Liberal Party's George Town branch from 2012 to 2013. They stood unsuccessfully in Bass at the 2018 state election, as one of five candidates on the party's ticket.
In November 2018, Archer announced that they would run for Liberal preselection in Bass. They were elected to parliament at the 2019 federal election, defeating the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) candidate Ross Hart.
Archer is a member of the moderate faction of the Liberal Party.
In December 2020, Archer publicly criticised the Morrison Government's trial of a cashless debit card to deliver welfare payments, stating that they would oppose its use within their own electorate and describing it as a "punitive measure enacted on the presumption that all welfare recipients within the trial areas are incapable of managing their finances and require the government's assistance". The House of Representatives passed legislation to make the card permanent by one vote, with Archer abstaining from voting despite their earlier criticism.
On 25 November 2021, Archer crossed the floor to support a motion by Helen Haines that called for a debate on a national anti-corruption commission. On 10 February 2022, they again crossed the floor with four other Liberal MPs to include protection for transgender students in the government's modifications to the Sex Discrimination Act. On 4 August 2022 Archer was the sole member of the Liberal/National coalition to cross the floor to vote in favour of the government's 43% carbon emissions reduction target legislation.
Personal life
Archer has five children with their husband Winston. After marrying they moved to their family property outside George Town, where they farm sheep and beef cattle.

John Edward McCarthy (1911–1977) was a radio actor and announcer. Born on a farm near Parnell, Michigan, they attended St. Thomas High School in Ann Arbor, and attended the University of Michigan.
Before World War II, they were an announcer at radio stations WMBC and WXYZ in Detroit, Michigan. On WXYZ in the late 1930s they also played the part of Ned Jordan, secret agent, a radio drama serial. Just before World War II, they became Chief Announcer at WXYZ.
During World War II, they were a Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps and was stationed on Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific where they ran the Armed Forces Radio station.
They played the part of the Green Hornet on the famous radio series from 1947 until the program ended in December 1952. The program originated from WXYZ in Detroit, Michigan. At that time, they were known as "Jack McCarthy". For several years until 1952 they were also station manager at WXYZ. During those years, two other national radio dramas originated from WXYZ radio: The Lone Ranger and Challenge of the Yukon (also known as Sergeant Preston of the Yukon).
During their early career in radio, they worked with Danny Thomas, Mike Wallace, Douglas Edwards and Al Hodge (who later went on to play television's Captain Video).
In 1936 they married Virginia Hanlon (1909–1997) and had two children: J. Thomas McCarthy (born 1937) and Maureen C. McCarthy (born 1953).
McCarthy moved to New York City in 1954, doing radio and television commercials. They also reported the news at WPIX television. Because there was already a "Jack McCarthy" on staff at WPIX, John McCarthy became known in New York as "John E. McCarthy". In July 1956 McCarthy was taken to the liner to interview survivors of the sinking of the ocean liner bound for New York harbor.
McCarthy was a devout Catholic and served as a lector at St. Ignatius Loyola Church in New York City. They died in 1977 and is buried in St. Patrick's Church cemetery in Parnell, Michigan.

"Down in New Orleans" is a song from Disney's 2009 animated film The Princess and the Frog, written by Randy Newman. Several versions of the song were recorded for use in different parts of the film and other materials. The song was nominated for Best Original Song at the 82nd Academy Awards but lost to "The Weary Kind" from Crazy Heart.
The full version of the song appears at the title sequence in the film, performed by Dr. John. The song introduces the city of New Orleans and foreshadows the manipulations of Dr. Facilier, the film's main villain. This is the first full song in the movie and the only one during the film not sung by one of the characters (Ne-Yo's "Never Knew I Needed" appears only over the closing credits).
Tiana sings both a prologue to the song at the opening of the film, and a shorter version of the song as a finale at its end. Anika Noni Rose, the voice of Tiana, also performed the song in full for The Princess and the Frog: Tiana and their Princess Friends along with songs by other Disney Princesses, including "Happy Working Song", another Academy Award-nominated song. A year before the film came out in theatres, Randy Newman themselves performed the song at the 2008 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.
The song was nominated for Best Song at the 53rd Grammy Awards; in this category and the Academy Award it lost to "The Weary Kind". "Almost There", another song from the film, performed by Tiana (Anika Noni Rose), was also nominated for the Oscar.

The speckle-breasted wren (Pheugopedius sclateri) is a species of bird in the family Troglodytidae. It is found in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.
Taxonomy and systematics
The speckle-breasted wren has at times been treated as conspecific with rufous-breasted wren (P. rutilus) and spot-breasted wren (P. maculipectus). They do form a superspecies.
The International Ornithological Committee (IOC) and the Clements taxonomy recognize three subspecies. The names in parentheses are from Clements.
P. s. sclateri (Marañon) Taczanowski (1879)
P. s. columbianus (Colombian) Chapman (1924)
P. s. paucimaculatus (speckle-breasted) Sharpe (1882)
BirdLife International (BLI) treats all three subspecies as separate species and calls them the "Maranon", "Colombian", and "speckle-breasted" wrens.
Description
The nominate P. s. sclateri is long and weighs . Adults have a reddish brown crown and a medium brown back and rump. Their tail has alternating gray and dull black bars. They have a narrow white supercilium and a dark eyestripe; the sides of the face and neck are mottled black and white. Their underparts from the chin down through the lower belly have fine black and white bars. The lower belly and flanks have bars but they are more diffuse, and the flanks also have a buff wash. Juveniles are similar to the adults but their underside's bars do not go as far down the belly.
P. s. columbianus is long. Adults have uniform brown upperparts with a rufous tinge to the crown and their tails have broad dark bars. They have a narrow white supercilium. Their face and most of their underparts are white with black bars and spots; the flanks are dark buff.
P. s. paucimaculatus is long. Males average and females . Adults have uniform brown upperparts with black bars on the tail. They have a narrow white supercilium and black and white speckled cheeks. Most of the underparts are whitish, with a heavily black-speckled breast, and the flanks are rufescent. The juvenile is similar but its breast is not as heavily speckled.
Distribution and habitat
The subspecies of speckle-breasted wren are found thus:
P. s. sclateri (Marañon), the drainage of the Marañon River in extreme southern Ecuador and northern Peru
P. s. columbianus (Colombian), Colombia; separately the western slopes of the Central and Eastern Andes
P. s. paucimaculatus (speckle-breasted), south from Ecuador's Manabí Province into Peru's Department of Piura
The three subspecies occur in somewhat different habitats. P. s. sclateri inhabits the undergrowth of dry forest up to approximately elevation. P. s. columbianus inhabits the thick understory of forest borders and open woodland at elevations between . P. s. paucimaculatus inhabits the interior and edges of deciduous semi-humid woodland, especially those with a dense understory. It ranges from the lowlands to approximately in Ecuador and to in Peru.
Behavior
Feeding
P. s. paucimaculatus is known to eat insects, and the other two subspecies are assumed to also be mostly or completely insectivorous. It and P. s. sclateri are known to forage in the understory, though the former also sometimes goes higher. They are usually in pairs and often join mixed-species foraging flocks. P. s. columbianus is assumed to have a similar strategy.
Breeding
Only P. s. paucimaculatus breeding phenology has been studied. Its breeding season apparently spans from April to September, based on the dates of observation of an active nest, of adults carrying food, and of recent fledglings. The one described nest was enclosed, made from sticks, vines, leaves, and lichen, and was on the ground; it held four eggs.
Vocalization
The songs of the three subspecies of speckle-breasted wren have no known differences. The song is "a series of fast, repeated phrases" sung by both sexes . The call is "a musical rising trill" .
Status
The IUCN has separately assessed all of the subspecies of speckle-breasted wren as being of The Least Concern. All three have relatively small ranges. P. s. sclateri and P. s. paucimaculatus occur in several protected areas, are fairly common to common, and appear to have enough of their preferred habitats. However, the population of P. s. columbianus is believed to be decreasing due to habitat fragmentation and destruction.

Georg, Crown Prince of Saxony or George (15 January 1893 – 14 May 1943) the last Crown Prince of Saxony, was the heir to the King of Saxony, Frederick Augustus III, at the time of the monarchy's abolition on 13 November 1918.
They later became a Roman Catholic priest and a Jesuit.
Early life and education
Georg was born on 15 January 1893 in Dresden, capital of Kingdom of Saxony.
They were the son of Prince Frederick Augustus, the later King Frederick Augustus III and their wife, Luise, née Archduchess Luise of Austria, Princess of Tuscany. Their siblings were the Princes Friedrich Christian and Ernst Heinrich and the Princesses Margarete, Maria Alix and Anna Monika
After their parents divorced in 1902, their father took sole parental responsibility for their children. They emphasised the Christian faith and a Catholic lifestyle. The children were educated by private tutors in a "prince's school" established by their father at the Saxon court. Most of the teachers were Protestants; this contributed to their later ecumenical attitude. Georg became Saxony's crown prince at age eleven, when their father acceded to the throne in 1904.
After graduating from high school in 1912, Georg studied political sciences for three months at the University of Breslau. They then began to study economics. During this time, they joined the KDSt.V. Winfridia.
First World War
After completing their studies in 1912, Georg joined the 1st Royal Saxon Leib-Grenadier Regiment No. 100. Their friend and fellow officer Ludwig Renn also served in that regiment; at the time, Ludwig still used their birth name Arnold Friedrich Vieth von Golßenau.
Georg held the rank of Captain when they were sent to the front at the start of World War I. They suffered a serious leg injury during the first months of the war. In 1915, Kaiser Wilhelm II granted them the Iron Cross first class "in recognition of the services they rendered in the recent battles.".
On 27 July 1916, they were added to the staff of Army Group Gallwitz. On 30 August 1916, they received the Military Order of St. Henry for their services in this staff.
On 30 November 1917, they were promoted to major and made commander of the 5th Royal Saxon Infantry Regiment "Crown Prince" No. 104. They commanded this regiment on both the Eastern and the Western Front. They held this command until 22 May 1918.
Engaged to be married
In the spring of 1918, newspapers announced the prince's engagement to Duchess Marie Amelia, daughter of Albrecht, Duke of Württemberg, the heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Württemberg. The end of the Saxon monarchy and the prince's desire to become a priest apparently led to the end of the engagement. The duchess died unmarried in 1923.
Abolition of monarchy and Jesuit priest
When Germany lost the war, the monarchies in Germany collapsed. Georg's father abdicated on 13 November 1918. This marked a fundamental turning point in their career planning. In 1919, they decided to renounce their rights on the Saxon throne, and become a Catholic priest instead. This decision was very controversial among people who hoped that the monarchy might one day be restored, and also met with significant concerns from the side of the Catholic Church. For example, Franz Löbman, the Apostolic Vicar for Saxony and Lusatia, and Archbishop Adolf Bertram of Breslau initially held that Georg should continue to hold political responsibility for Saxony. Nevertheless, Georg entered the Franciscan Order.
Finding the Franciscan life too intellectually limiting, Georg soon applied to transfer to the Jesuits instead. In the winter semester 1919/20, they studied philosophy at the University of Tübingen. During this period, they joined the [[Cartellverband der katholischen deutschen Studentenverbindungen|A.V. Guestfalia Tübingen]]. In the next semester, they studied at the University of Breslau.
In the winter semester 1920/21, they began studying theology at the University of Freiburg. They joined the KDSt.V. Hohenstaufen and Saxo-Thuringia. They completed this study in 1923. In the same year, they formally renounced their rights to the Saxon throne and became a Jesuit.
They were ordained a priest in Trzebnica on 15 July 1924 by Bishop Christian Schreiber of Meissen. The next day, they celebrated their first mass at the royal palace in Szczodre (. Their uncle Maximilian, also a priest, gave the homily during this service. Thereafter, the young prince was generally known as Pater Georg (Father George) and used the last name von Sachsen.German Jesuit Calendar George of Saxony. Retrieved on 9 November 2008 After their ordination, George worked as an auxiliary priest in their native Diocese of Meissen.
They then continued their studies at the Jesuit Collegium Canisianum in Innsbruck. In the fall of 1925, they joined the Upper German province of the Society of Jesus, however, in 1927, they switched to the East German province, which included their native Saxony. From 1928 to 1930, they studied at a Jesuit college in Valkenburg.
From 1933, they did pastoral work in Berlin. They helped build up the Jesuit residence Canisius College with the Catholic Gymnasium at Lietzensee. After taking their final vows in Berlin in 1936, they gave lectures and the spiritual exercises all over Germany. In their lectures, they promoted ecumenism and in particular the movement. Among their friends were spiritual leaders of different religions.
Opponent of Nazism
During one of their many lectures, they said in Meissen in 1929, referring to the increasing antisemitic agitation by some right-wing parties: Love is the order of the day in the relationship between Catholics and Protestant, and also to our Jewish fellow citizens. So they opposed Nazism from the beginning. They found it unbearable that the Nazi Party and after 1933 the state vilified and sought to destroy core values that were important to them personally — monarchical and dynastic Saxon traditions and fundamental values of Western Christianity. They felt that their family honor was offended and their work as a pastor was significantly impeded.
They worked in Berlin where they were credited with protecting Jews from the Nazi regime in notable contrast to their pro-Nazi brothers-in-law, Prince Frederich of Hohenzollern and Prince Franz Joseph of Hohenzollern-Emden.
As critic of the regime and a member of the former Saxon royal family, but in particular as a Catholic priest and a member of the Jesuit order, they were seen as highly suspect by the Nazi regime. They were shadowed by the Gestapo because they helped Jews leaving the country and they helped opposition politicians hiding from the regime. Sometimes, they had to go into hiding himself, and the police searched their home several times. They knew some of the people who later attempted the failed 20 July plot, in particular Ulrich von Hassell and General Paul von Hase. It is not clear whether they actually participated in the resistance.
Death
The former prince died on 14 May 1943 apparently while swimming in the Groß Glienicke Lake in Berlin, Germany. Georg's diary was found on the lakeshore with a final Latin entry reading , which is the Latin version of a phrase Jesus frequently spoke to their disciples in the Gospel of John and means "I go to the Father" or "I go to my Father." Their body was found several weeks after their death. Some people, including their brother Ernst Heinrich expressed doubts that their death had been an accident. Nevertheless, the autopsy determined that they died after suffering a heart attack.
They were buried in the Catholic Church of the Royal Court of Saxony, today known as the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, in Dresden on 16 June 1943. Their grave was damaged during the Allied bombing of Dresden in 1945 and later by the floods of August 2002.

Story
The show revolves around Amrita also known as Sister Didi, who is a head nurse in Muskaan Hospital at Patiala.

And that's the way Amrita continued treatment at the hospital even after their untimely death. Dr. Karan is the new attendant in the hospital. The moment they enter, they are appalled at the functioning of the hospital. They try to make changes, which obviously do not go down well with Amrita.

M&M's Adventure is an action-adventure video game released on the Nintendo DS and Wii video game consoles by Zoo Games and developed by Nikitova Games. A PlayStation 2 release was thought of when they chose the consoles on which it was going to be launched, but ultimately did not go ahead. The game takes place around Christmas, With Green, Yellow, and Red in the factory of M&MS when there is a system error, the harvested candies are ejected and all robots go AWOL, so the heroes will embark on the factory to stop the system error and save the factory.
The Factory works as a Lobby in which the player can access the different levels all based on different festivities which are: Valentine's Day, Easter, Fourth of July, Halloween, and Christmas being the final scenery and the central festivity in the story.
In the beginning only Red is playable but as the game progresses, one can play as Yellow who has the power to double jump, and Green who can attack with a racket. In the lobby, there are parts blocked by doors with the face of a character which requires the use of that character (depending on the color and image of the door M&M only that M&M can enter). The game has 1 boss of the world and the final is a snowman.
Reception
The two versions are almost exactly the same but with some differences such as the use of fog in the DS version to load the 3d terrain or that the Wii version has different soundtracks depending on the area, one is in. The game had bad reviews arguing that it is not worth buying from the critics but users consider it a decent game. In general, the Wii version had better critics than the DS in which the great graphic drop is noted and the fact that it has only two songs in the whole game.

Ron Blum is a former American football official in the National Football League (NFL), having served in that role from the 1985 NFL season through the 2007 NFL season. They joined the league as a line judge, officiating Super Bowl XXIV in 1990 and Super Bowl XXVI in 1992 and later became a referee for the start of the 1993 NFL season, replacing retired legend Pat Haggerty. Blum also was the Referee for the 1997 AFC Championship, which would be their highest game worked at the Referee position. Blum moved back to line judge beginning with the 2004 NFL season, and worked their last four seasons on the crew of referee Tony Corrente.
Blum wore the uniform number 83 from the 1985 to 1992 seasons and the number 7 from 1993 through 2007. They were the first non-referee to wear the uniform number 7; the number belonged to long-time referees Tommy Bell and, later, Fred Silva before Blum assumed it upon their promotion to crew chief. Side judge Keith Washington took the number upon Blum's retirement.
Blum played professional baseball for the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Chicago Cubs Organizations. They were All American in High School in basketball, football and baseball. Blum was a better quarterback than shortstop but their mom feared injury in football, so they opted for a baseball contract rather than pursuing their football dreams.  They are a member of the Marin County Hall of Fame where they attended Marin Catholic High School.
In the offseason, Blum is a golf professional. They served as an assistant pro at Silverado Golf Course in Napa during the 1970s. For a number of years in the 1980s they were the head golf pro at the Sonoma National Golf Course in Sonoma County, California.
Blum was the referee for the San Diego Chargers' 27–17 victory over the New York Giants at Giants Stadium on December 23, 1995. The contest was notable because both teams, the game officials and other field-level personnel spent the entire second half dodging snowballs hurled by unruly fans. A few such projectiles hit Blum's legs. When they picked up a telephone on the Chargers' sidelines to make a call to request that a verbal warning to the crowd be made over the public address system, a snowball narrowly missed hitting him. Instead it struck Chargers equipment manager Sid Brooks, who was knocked unconscious and had to be removed from the sidelines on a stretcher.

In enzymology, an α-pinene-oxide decyclase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
α-pinene oxide (Z)-2-methyl-5-isopropylhexa-2,5-dienal
Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, α-pinene oxide, and one product, (Z)-2-methyl-5-isopropylhexa-2,5-dienal.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically the class of intramolecular lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is α-pinene-oxide lyase (decyclizing). This enzyme is also called α-pinene oxide lyase. This enzyme participates in limonene and pinene degradation.

Frank Magid (September 1, 1931, Chicago, Illinois — February 5, 2010, Santa Barbara, California) was an American marketing consultant, widely known for introducing the "Action News" format of evening local TV news, and was an original developer of Good Morning America. Time magazine named Magid "the nation's leading television news doctor" in 1977, and they became the namesake of the term "Magidized".
After serving in the Army during the Korean War, Magid earned their undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Iowa, paying their tuition and living expenses with proceeds from the GI Bill and a variety of part-time jobs.
While in an organic chemistry class, they met Marilyn Young, a chemistry major from Waterloo, Iowa. The two wed in 1956, and moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where their wife had taken a job as a junior high science teacher. While a junior professor of social psychology, anthropology and statistics at the University of Iowa and Coe College, Magid launched their own company, Frank N. Magid Associates in 1956, selling their first research study to Merchants National Bank in Cedar Rapids.
A year later, they left teaching to devote their full efforts to the fledgling business. They built the company into the world's largest research-based strategy consulting company focused on media, entertainment and communications, which it remains. Media executives and on-air personalities frequently noted that the face of television was largely created not in the media centers of New York and Los Angeles, but in Marion, Iowa, where the company was based. Magid retired as CEO of Frank N. Magid Associates in 2002 and was succeeded by their son, Brent, but remained chairperson of the company until their death.
Frank Magid died, aged 78, from lymphoma in Santa Barbara, California. They were survived by their wife, two sons, four grandchildren and a brother.

Brian Groombridge (born December 18, 1953) is a Canadian visual artist. They currently live and works in Toronto, Ontario.
Biography
Groombridge was born in Sarnia, Ontario in 1953. They attended Sheridan College in 1972, and continued at the Ontario College of Art (O.C.A., now OCAD University) from 1974 to 1978. In 1977 they became part of O.C.A.'s New York Off-Campus Study Program. Groombridge works in various media including screen-print, letterpress and sculpture. Their work has been presented across Canada and abroad at venues including Het Apollohuis, Eindhoven, Netherlands; Cold City Gallery, Toronto; Contemporary Art Gallery, Vancouver; Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto; National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa; Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Halifax; Plug In ICA, Winnipeg; and The Power Plant, Toronto. Their work has been collected by various public institutions including Art Gallery of Hamilton; Art Gallery of Nova Scotia; Art Gallery of Ontario; Museum London; National Gallery of Canada; Vancouver Art Gallery; and numerous private collections.
Art Practice
Brian Groombridge's internationally exhibited work is characterized by a reductive, minimalist style with subject matter inspired by historical sources such as facts, data and measurements that usually pertain to the art world. As Jen Hutton writes in their 2013 essay Galileo's Finger, "[Groombridge's] sculptures, installations, and wall works employ a strict rationality: hard edges, cool metals, and bright, smooth finishes. If there is decoration, it is austere. If there is text, it is extremely concise or merely a label."
Groombridge's work often refers to the transient nature of things, and plays with the idea of fluctuation by presenting meaning and perception as flexible, not fixed. In a 2008 Globe and Mail article by Gary Michael Dault, Groombridge is quoted as saying ""I love the arrested moment. Meaning that moment when just to look at something stops it in its tracks—like slicing one frame from a film." Groombridge's work combines poetic and literal elements to comment on select moments of history and life that are worthy of contemplation and respect.
In their work Groombridge also often refers to systems of knowledge such as measurement, geography and cosmology. As E. C. Woodley states in a 2013 review in Art in America, "Signs of engagement with the cosmos appear frequently in Brian Groombridge's work, representing a hunger for knowledge beyond ourselves and a faith in such knowledge even if it is minuscule compared with what we don't know."

Thomas Wescott Secules (born November 8, 1964) is a former professional American football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys, Miami Dolphins and New England Patriots. They played college football at the University of Virginia.
Early years
Secules attended Chantilly High School, where they played football, basketball and baseball. They were a member of the National Honor Society. They accepted a football scholarship from the University of Virginia.
After breaking their foot in a high school All-Star game before entering college, they were forced to redshirt their first season. They would spend the next three years as the backup quarterback behind Don Majkowski.
As a first-year student, they started one game against the University of North Carolina Tarheels, in place of a suspended Majkowski (for breaking team rules).
As a junior in 1986, Secules started three games with Majkowski out with an injured shoulder, they won the three contests and received ACC offensive player of the week honors for their play against Wake Forest University. Against Clemson University in the second of those starts, they completed 30 of 49 attempts for 298 yards and 2 touchdowns to set school records for completions and attempts.
Secules was named the starter in their final year and although the team began the season 3–4, it won 5 straight games to finish with an 8–4 record. They also led one of the greatest comebacks in school history, with a 17-7 deficit against UNC in the final 4:44 minutes of the game, Secules passed for 2 touchdowns, en route to a 20-17 win. They received All-ACC honors (first Virginia quarterbacks since Bob Davis), while helping the school achieve its first home undefeated season since 1951 and reach its second bowl game in history, where they defeated Brigham Young University 22-16 in the All-American Bowl, with Secules being named the game's Most Valuable Player.
They finished their college career with 14 school records, including single-season passing yards (2,311), single-game passing yards (328), completions in a season (174), completion percentage in a career (56, 260 of 464), completion percentage in a season (58.8, 174 of 296), completion percentage in a game (80), 200-yard games (10) and most wins by a first-time starting quarterback (8). They suffered a serious right eye injury during a fight, that happened in the spring prior to the NFL draft, forcing them to have immediate surgery to repair the tear duct.
Professional career
Dallas Cowboys
Secules was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the sixth round (151st overall) of the 1988 NFL Draft. Head coach Tom Landry saw potential in their training camp performances and made the uncommon moves of not having them take snaps in preseason games and keeping 4 quarterbacks at the start of the regular season. After Danny White was lost for the year in the third game, Secules became the third-string quarterback but was declared inactive in all 16 games. At the end of the season, the team also protected them in Plan B free agency.
In 1989, new head coach Jimmy Johnson brought in a new coaching staff and drafted two rookie quarterbacks (Troy Aikman and Steve Walsh), so they were traded to the Miami Dolphins in exchange for a fifth round draft choice (#120-James Gray) on August 6.
Miami Dolphins
In 1989, the Miami Dolphins acquired Secules because they wanted to develop a young quarterback behind Dan Marino. In 1992, they were passed on the depth chart by Scott Mitchell and was eventually placed on the injured reserve list with a shoulder injury. They only threw 70 passes in three regular seasons and saw action mostly as a holder, having only one meaningful appearance during their time in Miami, where they threw 2 interceptions when Marino got hurt in a 1989 loss against the Pittsburgh Steelers.
New England Patriots
On March 22, 1993, they were signed as a free agent by the New England Patriots. They were the backup to rookie Drew Bledsoe and became the starter in the fifth game of the season against the Phoenix Cardinals, helping the team to its first win. They would lose their next 3 starts and in the ninth game while playing against the Buffalo Bills, they suffered a separated left shoulder and was replaced by a healthy Bledsoe. They were released on April 21, 1994.
They finished their career with 108 completions in 204 attempts, 1,311 passing yards, 4 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in 57 games.
Personal life
ESPN broadcaster Chris Berman once nicknamed them Scott "Won't You Let Me Take You on a" Secules; the nickname was a play on the lyrics of the song "Sea Cruise" by Frankie Ford.
Secules worked as the Senior Associate Athletic Director for External Affairs at Virginia Commonwealth University from November 2006 until October 2009. They currently serve as the Senior Regional Manager for Partner Development for Positive Coaching Alliance - a national non-profit that focuses on developing kids through sports done right.

Lines is the fifth studio album by the American pop group The Walker Brothers. The album was released in 1976 and was the second since reforming in 1975. The album failed to chart and includes the singles "Lines" and "We're All Alone", neither of which met with much success.
The album was stylistically similar to their 1975 comeback No Regrets, matching the general musical styles of Country and Pop music and marrying them to romantic orchestral arrangements. Aside from "First Day" which is actually the work of John Maus, writing under the pseudonym A. Dayam, the album is compiled of non-original compositions. Scott Walker would not contribute new songs to the group until the following album Nite Flights.
Reception
Lines received mixed reviews from the majority of critics.

Adam (Syriac: ), also known by their Chinese name Jingjing (), was an 8th-century Syriac Christian monk and scholar in China. They composed the text on the Nestorian Stele, which described the history of the Church of the East in China from 635 to 781. Many scholars believe they are also the author of the later Jingjiao Documents.
Biography
Scholars place Adam's probable birth at around 750 or 751. Adam's father was named Yazedbozid (Syriac: , Chinese: ), who was part of a fighting unit invited to come to China by the Tang court to help quell the Lushan Rebellion. According to the Syriac text on the stele, Adam's grandfather was named Mailas ( ), and was a priest from Balkh ( ) in Tokharistan ( ), in northern Afghanistan. It has been posited that Adam was raised or born in China and received a Chinese education due to their grasp of Classical Chinese and Chinese religious thought that's observed in their writings.
Nestorian stele
Around 781, Adam composed the Nestorian Stele. Sources also state that Adam translated (by imperial order) multiple Biblical texts into Chinese. The texts in question seemed to be paraphrases of certain portions of the New Testament and to a smaller extent, parts of the Old Testament. In 786, Adam helped an Indian Buddhist monk from Kapisha called Prajna translate the Buddhist text Sutra of the Six Mahayana Paramitas from an Iranian language (Sogdian or Bactrian) to Chinese. The translated text was presented to Emperor Dezong in 787, who rejected the translation on the grounds it was faulty, corrupted, and confused by a fusion of Buddhist and Nestorian concepts.
Adam was bilingual in Persian and Chinese. They may also have been literate in Syriac, Arabic and possibly Sogdian or Bactrian.

Peter Malcolm William Entwisle (20 September 1948 – 14 March 2018) was a New Zealand art historian and writer, notably on the history of Dunedin and of New Zealand art.
Early life
Entwisle's parents both worked within the book industry. Their father, Arnold, had been born in Cheshire, and moved to London where they worked as a buyer for a bookshop. Here they met Mary Crabb, who worked at Hogarth Press for Leonard Woolf. They married in 1936. After serving in World War II, Arnold got a scholarship to Oxford University, and gained a degree in history.
Peter was born in Newmarket, Suffolk, England in 1948. They had three sisters, Jane, Susan and Sarah. Peter was the third child. In 1952, the family moved to Kuala Lumpur in Malaya, where Arnold worked in the British Colonial Service. The family moved from there to Dunedin in 1955, where Arnold had gained a post as a lecturer at the University of Otago. From a young age, Peter became acquainted with many of the city's top literary and intellectual names, whom their father had become friends with through their university work. These included the circle of poets and artists who surrounded Charles Brasch. It was Brasch who awakened Entwisle's interest in Dunedin's history and architecture.
Peter attended George Street Normal School, Dunedin North Intermediate, and Otago Boys' High School, before enrolling at the University of Otago in 1968. They graduated in 1975 with a BA(Hons) and MLitt in philosophy. While still a student they married Rosemary. They had two daughters, Rebecca and Jennifer.
Later career
Entwisle and their family moved to England in 1976. Their initial plans were to complete postgraduate study, but instead they worked as a freelance journalist while acquiring a love for European art. They returned to Dunedin in 1980 where they began work at Dunedin Public Art Gallery, of which they were soon appointed curator, a post they held for 20 years. After 2000, they worked as a freelance writer, and as a regular columnist for the Otago Daily Times. They also became a passionate advocate for Dunedin's built heritage, working as a consultant to the Dunedin City Council's planning department. Their written work covered historical and architectural subjects, and also included art criticism. Several of their biographical writings became part of the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. They also curated a number of art exhibitions.
Heritage and conservation work
Entwisle was involved in the preservation of Dunedin's architectural heritage, and was involved in several campaigns including those against structural changes to the exterior of the Dunedin Municipal Chambers and against the construction of the Forsyth Barr Stadium at University Plaza. They stood for the office of Mayor of Dunedin in 1980 as part of a campaign against the building of an aluminium smelter at Aramoana. They were a member of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust from 1985.
Death
Entwisle died on 14 March 2018 due to illness at their home in central Dunedin.  They are survived by their two daughters, grandchildren and their sisters.

Unforgivable () is a 2011 French drama film directed by André Téchiné, starring André Dussollier, Carole Bouquet, and Mélanie Thierry. The film is an adaptation of Philippe Djian's novel Unforgivable which received the Jean Freustié award in 2009. It was previously called The Angels Terminus. The film premiered at the Directors' Fortnight at the 2011 Cannes film festival.
Plot
Francis, an aging successful writer of crime novels, arrives in Venice where they plan to rent out an apartment to live in peace and quiet for the next year while writing a new novel. Through their search they meet Judith, a real estate agent, who insists on showing them a house accessible only by boat on the island of Sant'Erasmo. Francis is smitten with Judith, a beautiful ex-model about 20 years their junior, and acquiesces to rent the property if they move in with him.
Eighteen months later, Francis and Judith are blissfully married and living together in Sant'Erasmo. However happiness is not conducive for them to write. Suffering from writer's block, they roam the streets and canals of Venice in search of inspiration. Alice, their adult daughter from a previous marriage, comes to visit towing along their ten-year-old daughter, Vicky. Alice, no longer with the father of their daughter, is an aimless aspiring actor. They go swimming with Judith, takes a few strokes in the opposite direction and disappears without explanation. Vicky, abandoned by Alice, is picked up by Roger, their father. Alarmed, Francis hires Anna Maria, a vodka-swilling private detective, who many years ago had a lesbian relationship with Judith. Alice is found to be having a passionate love affair with Alvise, a penniless aristocrat and small-time heroin dealer.
Months pass and Francis is still suffering from writer's block. Their relationship with Judith is severely strained as they are distracted by their work demands of the peak season. They become jealous and begins to question Judith's fidelity. Before they met, they had many affairs with people from both sexes. Francis decides to have them followed by Jérémie, Anna Maria's son, a troubled young man who has just been released from prison. This transgression causes Judith to actually have an affair with the young man when they realize what is happening. As the relationship with their husband deteriorates, Judith decides to leave Sant'Erasmo and moves back to Venice. Francis accepts the situation with trepidation.
During the autumn, Jérémie is attacked by a gay man who kills their beloved dog as retaliation. Jérémie had previously thrown their attacker into a canal. Francis harshly criticized Jérémie for their behaviour. Shortly after Jérémie slashes their wrist in a suicide attempt, but they are saved by Francis. Anna Maria returns from Paris with news about Alice who sent their father a disturbing video of themselves having sex with Alvise. Anna Maria has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. In the winter Alice returns to Venice, as Alvise is now in prison in the city.  They are welcomed by Judith, and Francis and Alice make amends. They ask their father for forgiveness but is adamant in their love for Alvise and tells Francis that their daughter is better off with their ex-husband.
At Anna Maria's funeral, Jérémie is repeatedly hit by Francis who is furious about their lack of feelings towards Anna Maria. The two men reconcile when Jérémie, leaving Venice to find a new life, comes to say goodbye to Francis.  They are young, they say, and at least time is on their side. Francis finally manages to complete their novel. They have no more reasons to stay in Venice. They run to see Judith and they ask them to move to Paris with him.

Reception
The film garnered a favorable critical reaction. , the film hols a 77% approval rating Rotten Tomatoes, based on 35 reviews with an average rating of 6.71 out of 10. Metacritic gave the film an average score of 66/100, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Ty Burr, writing for The Boston Globe, called the film: "An elegantly rambling Franco-Italian affair about the ways we do each other wrong while trying to do each other right…. Unforgivable is about doubt, the gnawing gap between the things we crave and our inability to own them."
In The New York Times, Manohla Dargis commented: "Unforgivable isn't one of Mr. Téchiné's greatest achievements, but it's engrossing even when its increasingly populated story falters, tripped up by unpersuasive actions, connections and details."
Roger Ebert said that: "What makes the film involving is that it doesn't depend on the mechanical resolution of the plot, but on the close observation of its effects on these distinctive characters. Like all movies set in Venice, Unforgivable derives much of its effect from the city itself, which acts as a stage set for the lives lived there. By placing Andre's island both within the city and apart from it, it underlines their own isolation from these busy lives that have intersected with his. Nothing ever seems straightforward in Venice, least of all its romances."
In the words of Mick LaSalle writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, "the film creates the lived-in sense of being in the world of the characters. Thing happen. The story goes one way and then another. We care, but not much, not really. And yet we do start to care, as if simply as a result of proximity. We are there with these people, or at least we feel we are, which is the ultimate movie illusion…... Unforgivable is like a conversation with a stranger, but a real conversation - with the additional pleasure of Venice in every shot."
The Christian Science Monitor'''s film critic Peter Rainer said that director "André Téchiné makes movies about people whose lives are perpetually in flux – the more fluctuations the better. In the human comedy, Téchiné seems to be saying, to their delight, nothing stays the same. Here is something exasperating and yet marvelous about Téchiné's approach, and this dichotomy is no more apparent than in their latest film, Unforgivable'', which is about a best-selling crime novelist whose personal life is as messy as their books are carefully plotted."

Low Moor F.C. was an English association football club, from Clitheroe, Lancashire. The club was sometimes called Clitheroe Low Moor or Low Moor (Clitheroe), but Low Moor was the club's self-reported name.
History
The club was founded in 1879 and had reported matches as early as September 1880. The same year Clitheroe F.C. was founded in the same town, which instantly made it difficult for either club to become competitive on the national, or even local, stage; Low Moor suffered a 13-1 defeat to Bolton Wanderers in 1881. The defeat came a month after the club's biggest win - a 5-1 home victory over Abbey Village FC of Withnell in the first round of the Lancashire Senior Cup.
The club competed in the FA Cup three times during the 1880s. It first entered in 1883-84, but lost 6-0 in the first round to Blackburn Park Road, all of the goals coming in the first half.
The Moorites got a revenge of sorts the following year as the clubs were drawn together in the first round, at Park Road's ground; after a 3-3 draw, the Roadsters scratched, giving Low Moor a passage into the second round. Low Moor then went out to Southport Central, amidst some controversy as there were claims that two of the Southport goals were offside, and the Moorites denied two legitimate scores "to the amazement of spectators and players".
The club's final entry was in 1885-86, losing heavily to Rossendale.
Although the club seems to have continued into the 1887-88 season, the last reported match for the club was a 0-0 draw at Burnley Union Stars in front of 200 people in December 1886.

The Finniss River drains part of the east side of Fleurieu Peninsula into Lake Alexandrina in South Australia. It is part of the Murray–Darling basin.
The Finniss River starts east of Yundi and flows roughly east to its mouth in the Goolwa Channel of the lower Murray River, opposite Hindmarsh Island. It supports a wide range of flora (both natural and introduced weed species) and macroinvertebrates despite much of the catchment being cleared and grazed.
During the 2006–2010 drought, low water levels in Lake Alexandrina and the outflows of the Finniss River and Currency Creek exposed acid sulfate soils which would normally be submerged. Temporary flow regulators were installed in August–September 2009 across the Goolwa Channel to maintain the water level to keep these soils wet to prevent more acid being leached out. They were partially removed in September 2010 and completely by October 2012.
Watchalunga Nature Reserve, established in 2015, is in the lower reaches of the Finniss River, where it provides swampland habitat for the Mount Lofty Ranges Southern Emu-wren, an endangered species, and the southern bell frog, which is a threatened species.

Popular Science (1935–1949) is a series of short films, produced by Jerry Fairbanks and released by Paramount Pictures.
The Popular Science film series is a Hollywood entertainment production – the only attempt by the movie industry to chronicle the progress of science, industry and popular culture during the first half of the 20th century.
The series, filmed in Magnacolor, was the first to profile: father of television Philo T. Farnsworth (1939), Frank Lloyd Wright and their architectural school (1942), building Hoover Dam (1935), building the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge (1936), Academy Award-nominated Moon Rockets (1947), the Electron Microscope (1942), Jet Aircraft (1946), the birth of Plastic Surgery (1937), Telephone Answering Machine (1936), Fuel from Corn Cobs (1949), Rust Heinz and their Phantom Corsair car (1938), world's first full-scale (whole body) X-ray technique (1936), the "Mechanical Brain" Computer at UCLA (1948), Contact Lenses (1936), the Northrop "Flying Wing" (1948). The series also promoted Paramount with a tour (1938) of the then-new Fleischer Studios facility in Miami, Florida, which produced animated cartoons for Paramount.
The series was created by independent Hollywood film producer Jerry Fairbanks in May 1935. Produced with the cooperation of the editors of Popular Science magazine, the series introduced its audience to advances in medicine, aviation, science and technology, television, home improvement, planes, trains and automobiles, as well as an assortment of strange and whimsical inventions.
During its 14-year theatrical run, the Popular Science film series was honored with numerous awards and acclaim, including 5 Academy Award nominations. The Popular Science series also received a Special Commendation from the US Department of War in 1943 for its unparalleled coverage of American military technology involved World War II.
This film series has been a staple on television for decades, most recently shown on the American Movie Classics cable network, hosted by Nick Clooney and Bob Dorian.

Chuandianella ovata is an extinct shrimp-like arthropod with unknown affinity that lived during the Atdabanian Age of the Early Cambrian (about 520 to 516 million years ago). It is the only species classified under the genus Chuandianella. Its fossils were recovered from the Chengjiang Lagerstätte of the Maotianshan Shales in China. Its carapace was made up of calcium phosphate.
It was originally described in 1975 under the "ostracod"-like genus Mononotella, as Mononotella ovata. In 1991, the paleontologists Xian-Guang Hou and Jan Bergström reclassified it under the new genus Chuandianella when additional discoveries of more complete specimens made its resemblance to Waptia fieldensis more apparent. Like W. fieldensis, Chuandianella ovata had a bivalved carapace with a median ridge, a pair of caudal rami, a single pair of antennae, and stalked eyes. In 2004, paleontologist Jun-Yuan Chen tentatively transferred it to the genus Waptia. However, C. ovata had eight abdominal somites in contrast to five in W. fieldensis. Its limbs were biramous and were undifferentiated, unlike those of W. fieldensis. Other authors deemed these differences to be enough to separate it from Waptia to its own genus.
In 2022, Chuandianella was rejected from Hymenocarina, the group includes Waptia, because of subequal limbs and absence of mandibles, and was instead considered an "upper stem-group arthropod" as opposed to the more derived euarthropod hymenocarines.

Tombouctou Region (Bambara: ߕߎߡߎߕߎ ߘߌߣߋߖߊ tr. Tumutu Dineja) is one of the administrative regions of Mali. It is the largest of Mali's 10 regions and includes a large section of the Sahara Desert. For administrative purposes, the region is subdivided into five cercles.
The region is part of northern Mali that was separated and declared independent by the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) during the Tuareg rebellion of 2012. In the course of the conflict, the MNLA lost control of the territory to Islamist militias.
Tombouctou Region is world-famous for its capital, the ancient city Timbuktu (), synonymous to 19th-century Europeans with an elusive, hard-to-reach destination. The city gained fame in 1390 when its ruler, Mansa Musa, went on a pilgrimage to Mecca, stopping with their entourage in Egypt and dispensing enough gold to devalue the Egyptian currency. This started the legend of a city in the interior of Africa, where roads were said to be paved with gold and buildings topped with roofs of gold.
History
The city is located at the southern edge of the Sahara, near the Niger River, which has headwaters in the highlands very near the Atlantic coast before its long journey to the north east, before finally turning south to reach the Atlantic. The riches of the kingdom were due to Tombouctou's position as the southern terminus of the trans-Saharan trade in gold, salt, kola nuts, copper and slaves.
Timbuktu's decline began with the capture of the city by Morocco in 1592. Many Islamic scholars were dispersed, some to Morocco. Morocco had difficulty holding onto the city, as the supply lines were long compared to the closer kingdoms vying for dominance of the region. Ultimately, however, it was the rise of sea trade along the West Africa coast that doomed the overland routes that connected North Africa to sub-Saharan Africa. The city lost its economic base and its fine university was not enough to save Timbuktu from decline.
Cut off from major trade routes, the city retained an aura of spectacular treasure. When French explorers rediscovered the city in 1815 they were disappointed to find a sand-blown city of low mud buildings.
The region was marginalized under French colonial control, which ended in 1960. The French opened up shorter trade routes to the Atlantic, cutting into the trans-Sahara trading economy and people in the city.
In early 2012, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad and other militant groups opposed to the government of Mali swept through the region, entering Timbuktu without a fight after making a deal with local Arab militias. On 6 April 2012, the region was declared independent from Mali as part of the new country of Azawad. However, Mali refused to acknowledge the Azawadi Declaration of Independence, and the international community continues to recognise Bamako's claim to the region.
Administrative subdivisions
The region is divided into five cercles:
The larger parts of Timbuktu and Goundam cercles (323,326 km² with about 134,000 inhabitants) were separated in 2016 to form the new Taoudenit Region.

Francisco Enrique Camps Ortiz (born 28 August 1962) is a Spanish politician belonging to the Partido Popular (PP). They served as President of the Valencian Government, the Valencian regional administration, in the period 2003–2011, and is still a member of the Corts Valencianes, the Valencian regional parliament.
Biography
A lawyer, Mr Camps is married with three children. They were first elected as a local councillor to Valencia city council, serving from 1991 to 1996, occupying the Presidency of the municipal transport body during that period. In 1996 they were elected to the Spanish Congress, representing Valencia province serving as Secretary of State for Territorial Administrations. However they resigned from the Congress 11 months later in February 1997, after being named as Minister for Culture and Education in the Generalitat Valenciana, retaining that post until January 1999. At the 2000 General Election, they returned to the Spanish Congress but again resigned in 2002 in order to run for President of the Valencian Government.
In July 2003 they were elected president, being re-elected with absolute majorities in 2007 and 2011. During their administration they attracted the European Grand Prix auto race and the America's Cup yacht race.
They continued to serve as president until their resignation in 2011.
Gürtel case
In February 2009 Camps was implicated in a scandal known as the Gürtel Case (Caso Gürtel) relating to an alleged criminal network controlled by business person Francisco Correa. ("Gürtel" is the German translation for the business person's surname, Correa/belt).
In March 2009, Camps was one of several PP figures accused by magistrate Baltasar Garzón of taking bribes.
Garzón alleged that Camps received €12,000 towards a tailor's bill from an associate of Correa. For two years Camps was to claim that they paid for the clothes himself.
The case against Camps was transferred to a local court in Valencia which, in August 2009, ruled that Camps had not committed a crime.
In May 2010 Camps' bribery case reopened as the High Court in Madrid ruled that there was enough evidence to bring a case against him. Camps was reelected as President of Valencia in May 2011, although the case threatened to undermine their political career. On 20 July 2011, Camps resigned as Valencian premier and leader of the Valencian Partido Popular in order to avoid standing trial while in office. They continued to maintain their innocence although they said that they may have received presents.
On 25 January 2012 they were declared 'not guilty' by a popular jury.
Six years later, on 25 January 2018 Ricardo Costa, Mr. Camps's old colleague, admitted that the People's Party in the Valencian Community was financed with "dirty money". This acknowledgement was helpful for the inquiry into political financing using "Associations" in several provinces of the Valencian Country.
Formula One case
Moreover, Francisco Camps is under investigation for the Formula One in Valencia.

Pei Di (, approximate year of birth 714) was a Chinese poet of the Tang dynasty, with one work included in the popular Three A Hundred Tang Poems. Pei Di was a contemporary of Wang Wei, although younger by fifteen years. Pei Di has twenty preserved poems in the Wangchuan ji poetry collection, which collects twenty matching poems by Wang Wei and Pei Di. The poet's name is also rendered into English as "P'ei Ti" or "Pei Shidi" (shi = 十). The close personal friendship between Wang Wei and Pei Di is preserved in a letter by Wang Wei inviting Pei for a Springtime visit together at Wang's country estate. This letter has been translated by Arthur Waley. Pei also had a poetic relationship with Du Fu. Other than through Pei Di's few surviving poems, and the poems addressed to them by Wang Wei and Du Fu, "pitifully little" is known about Pei Di, other than that they had a reasonably successful government career.
Poems
One of Pei Di's poems, translated by Witter Bynner as "A Farewell to Cui", a farewell poem dedicated to a friend named Cui, was included in the important collection Three A Hundred Tang Poems, as exemplary of the five-character (line length) version of the quatrain style known as juéjù, or "cut verse". Pei Di is also famous for their collaboration with Wang Wei: this series of poems (the Wangchuan ji) has been translated into English as "The Wang River Collection", or similarly. Consisting of twenty preserved titles, for each title Wang Wei wrote a pair of couplets loosely inspired by landscape features around their country estate. These were then matched by a pair of couplets on the same theme by Pei Di. These and a few other poems by Pei Di are preserved in Scroll 129 of the Quantangshi.
Wang Wei's letter to Pei Di
A letter from Wang Wei to their friend Pei Di (here transliterated P'ei Ti) is preserved, and has been translated by Arthur Waley:
PROSE LETTER
_To the Bachelor-of-Arts P`ei Ti_
Of late during the sacrificial month, the weather has been calm and
clear, and I might easily have crossed the mountain. But I knew that you
were conning the classics and did not dare disturb you. So I roamed
about the mountain-side, rested at the Kan-p`ei Temple, dined with the
mountain priests, and, after dinner, came home again. Going northwards,
I crossed the Yuuan-pa, over whose waters the unclouded moon shone with
dazzling rim. When night was far advanced, I mounted Hua-tzuu's Hill and
saw the moonlight tossed up and thrown down by the jostling waves of
Wang River. On the wintry mountain distant lights twinkled and vanished;
in some deep lane beyond the forest a dog barked at the cold, with a cry
as fierce as a wolf's. The sound of villagers grinding their corn at
night filled the gaps between the slow chiming of a distant bell.
Now I am sitting alone. I listen, but cannot hear my grooms and servants
move or speak. I think much of old days: how hand in hand, composing
poems as we went, we walked down twisting paths to the banks of clear
streams.
We must wait for Spring to come: till the grasses sprout and the trees
bloom. Then wandering together in the spring hills we shall see the
trout leap lightly from the stream, the white gulls stretch their wings,
the dew fall on the green moss. And in the morning we shall hear the cry
of curlews in the barley-fields.
It is not long to wait. Shall you be with me then? Did I not know the
natural subtlety of your intelligence, I would not dare address to you
so remote an invitation. You will understand that a deep feeling
dictates this course.
Written without disrespect by Wang Wei, a dweller in the mountains.
Legacy
Pei Di's influence on posterity mainly derives from their contributions to the Wangchuan Ji anthology, consisting of 20 of their poems written as responsive matches to 20 of Wang Wei's. The series has inspired various subsequent works, including translations into English by Jerome Ch'en and Michael Bullock and by H. C. Chang. Also, many centuries later, Pei Di's poem in the 300 Tang Poems remains as one of the more reprinted poems.

The Early Bird Show was an Australian children's television show that aired on Network Ten in Australia from 26 January 1985 until 10 June 1989. The show was so popular that a magazine about it was published in 1989.
Format
Produced by Dixie Duncan and directed by Spencer Wilson, Ray McKenna and Bob Loxton, the Early Bird Show was hosted by Australian rock singer Darryl Cotton Marie Van Maaren and Marty The Monster. The Early Bird Show, an extremely popular family and children's variety show, was a live, five-hour production on air from 7am - 12pm every Saturday.
The show included many popular regulars including, Roy Hampson ( Good Morning Melbourne co-Host with Annette Allison) as the 'professor' Liane Scurrah-Jonas VFL/AFL injury prevention fitness trainer, Author, breakfast announcer& talkback radio, Pilates and Aerobics trainer) 'fun & fitness', Simon 'pancake breakfasts', Frits Maaten (Animal nature park owner) and their animals, Rosemary (Dance School owner and teacher) and their EBS dancers, Colin Beaumont, (entertainer & Musician) remote control car segment, Brad McLeod (The Computer Man), puppets Mr and Mrs Timms.
Many big names in music, TV, radio and sport appeared regularly to take a part of the fun and games.
In 1989, the show was shortened to two hours and renamed Club 10. This version lasted ten weeks before being replaced with Video Hits, a music video show.
The Early Bird Show was forward thinking Creation for families by Dixie Duncan which is still remembered with such enthusiasm today. It gave the chance for many children to express their talents or just be a part of a TV family. It was a platform where those who were regulars could support many charities. The Early Bird Show lives on in the memories of all those who either watched or was a part of it.
Incident
A 1987 episode featured Rags the Kangaroo beating up Marty the Monster. It garnered international attention outside of Australia.
Other versions
An earlier version of the show had aired from 1977 until 1980. Shown on weekday mornings, The Early Bird Show featured hosts Mike McCarthy and Marie Van Maaren. The show was replaced in 1981 by the long-running Good Morning Australia (breakfast TV). A similar, but unrelated, show named Early Birds was broadcast by SAS10 in Adelaide in the early 1970s. The show was hosted by Veronica Overton and Fat Cat. "Early Birds" was a mix of cartoons, competitions and music clips. During one telecast, Overton resigned on camera, saying "Goodbye children. Fat Cat will be back on Monday, but I won't". Occasional stand-in, DiDi James, took over the show for a short while and later Jane Reilly became host.
TVW 7 Perth (TVW Enterprises owned TVW 7 Perth and SAS 10 Adelaide in the 70s) also had a very popular Earlybirds show in the 1970s and 1980s from 7 to 9 am. It featured Fat Cat and another character Percy Penguin, plus puppets, Wilbur Worm, who had a sarcastic streak, in the early days, and Sunny Sandgroper, who always told appalling jokes. There were two hosts, one male and one female, and those who appeared over the years on the Perth version were Keith Geary, Ian Teasdale, Sandy Baker (née Palmer), Carolyn Noble, Sharon Dale, Peter Dean, Ann Sanders and others. It was made at TVW Tuart Hill Studios and often presented outdoor broadcasts at shopping centers and other establishments. It ran mainly during each school holiday initially and then each weekday toward the end, when networking pushed it out of the schedules in favour of Agro's Cartoon Connection and ultimately new shows. TVW did a Saturday version of Earlybirds, calling it Fat Cat's Funtime Show. It ran throughout the late 1970s and 80s years until Saturday Disney brought about its demise.
In New Zealand, TV3 have also alternated and created their very own version of the show which went from 1989 to 1992. It originally aired on weekday mornings from 7:00am to 9:00am before shifting to weekend mornings (same timeslot). Also known as EBS, it was presented by Suzy Cato and a puppet character named Russell Rooster along with another puppet character, Aunty Kiri Kea and their family of Rubber Ducks. This version of the show contains a few different segments which include local skits, competitions, games, interviews, jokes with Kiri and the Rubber Ducks, how to draw cartoon monsters with Mark, cooking with Annabel Langbein, Hollywood gossip with David Hartnell and also a variety of cartoons from overseas such as The Super Mario Brothers Super Show, The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show, It's Punky Brewster!, Beetlejuice, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Garfield and Friends, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, The Adventures of Raggedy Ann and Andy, Kissyfur, Super Friends, Dinosaucers, Camp Candy, Dennis the Menace, Voltron: Defender of the Universe, Superman, Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics, The Real Ghostbusters (as well as its spin-off Slimer! And the Real Ghostbusters), The Wuzzles, Sylvanian Families, Pinocchio: The Series and DuckTales as well as some live-action programmes including the New Zealand children's educational series Aunties' Alphabet and the U.S. blooper special series Life's Most Embarrassing Moments. Cato later went on to host other television programmes such as Suzy's World, 3pm and You and Me. They then later ran a company called Treehut Productions which produces show dedicating to share "Blue Light" safety messages.

State Route 178 (SR 178) is part of Maine's system of numbered state highways, located along the east side of the Penobscot River northeast of Bangor. It runs from State Street in Brewer (where it is concurrent with SR 9) north to Milford where it terminates at U.S Route 2 (US 2) just east of Old Town.
Route description
SR 178 begins in the south in Brewer, at the intersection of North Main Street (SR 9) and State Street. It begins overlapped with SR 9. The two routes proceed concurrently along the Penobscot River for towards Eddington. After crossing the town line, SR 178 splits to the north while SR 9 (also known as Airline Highway on this stretch) continues east.
SR 178 continues northward along the river, passing through the town of Bradley before reaching Milford where it terminates at US 2 (which crosses the river from Old Town, just to the west).
History
Southern terminus in Brewer
The southern terminus of SR 178 is somewhat strange in that it is not located at an intersection with another numbered route; SR 178 instead ends at State Street, while SR 9 continues on North Main Street for one block towards modern US 1A.
State Street was, in the past, part of a numbered highway - US 1A Business. This business route, which has since been decommissioned, was designated in 1955 over what used to be US 1 Business, and US 1A before that, meaning SR 178 has historically terminated at one of these routes. When these historical designation(s) were removed, SR 178's terminus was never moved, and thus it now terminates along SR 9 one block north of its terminus with US 1A.

Johann Sigismund Graf von Riesch (2 August 1750 – 2 November 1821) joined the army of Habsburg Austria as a cavalry officer and, during their career, fought against the Kingdom of Prussia, Ottoman Turkey, Revolutionary France, and Napoleon's French Empire. They became a general officer during the French Revolutionary Wars and held important commands during the War of the Second Coalition. They displayed a talent for leading cavalry formations, but proved less capable when given corps-sized commands. During the 1805 Ulm Campaign in the Napoleonic Wars, the French badly defeated their corps and forced it to surrender soon afterward. From 1806 to their death in 1821, they were the Proprietor (Inhaber) of an Austrian cavalry regiment.
Early career
Born in Vienna on 2 August 1750 into a noble Saxon family, Riesch enlisted in the army of the Electorate of Saxony. In 1773 they switched to the Austrian army, joining the Chevauxleger Regiment # 1 as an Oberleutnant. They fought against the Prussians in the War of the Bavarian Succession in 1778–1779. During the Austro-Turkish War they received promotion to Oberst (colonel) of the Nassau-Usingen Cuirassier Regiment # 14. On 18 August 1788, they distinguished themselves in battle against Turkish cavalry on the Timiş River in the Banat.
Riesch married Theresia Josephine Koháry in 1792. During the War of the First Coalition, they were wounded in action on 16 March 1793 at Tirlemont. In July of that year they received promotion to the rank of General-Major. In May 1794 they defeated a numerically superior force of French cavalry at Maubeuge. At the Battle of Fleurus on 26 June 1794, they led a brigade in the 1st Column consisting of two battalions of the Austrian Samuel Gyulai Infantry Regiment # 32, three French Émigré battalions in the Legions of Damas, Béon, and Mathieu, and two squadrons of the Béon Legion cavalry.
Emperor Francis II raised Riesch to the rank of Feldmarschall-Leutnant on 4 March 1796. That year found them serving in the Army of the Upper Rhine under Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser and later under Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour. Riesch led a small cavalry division in Archduke Charles' success at the Battle of Würzburg on 3 September 1796. The Coburg Dragoon Regiment # 37, Kaiser Hussar Regiment # 2, and the Münster Dragoon Regiment were placed under their orders. At the Battle of Neuwied, they and their cavalry ably covered the Austrian retreat after the French victory on 18 April 1797.
War of the Second Coalition
Riesch helped win the First Battle of Stockach on 25 March 1799 by leading a brilliant cavalry charge that overthrew Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul's French cavalry reserve. For their Stockach exploit, they received the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa in August 1801. They again commanded a cavalry division under Olivier, Count of Wallis at the First Battle of Zurich on 4 June. On this occasion, they led 12 squadrons of the Nassau-Usingen Cuirassiers # 9 and the Mack Cuirassiers # 10.
In the 1800 campaign in southern Germany, Riesch again led a cavalry division under Pál Kray at the Second Battle of Stockach on 3 May and at the Battle of Messkirch two days later. A string of Austrian defeats ended in an armistice that summer. In the interim, the emperor appointed the youthful Archduke John of Austria to lead the army. A cavalry specialist, Riesch found themselves in command of a corps containing infantry, cavalry, and artillery. When the armistice lapsed in November, both armies rapidly moved into contact. Riesch and Ludwig Baillet de Latour led their commands against the French divisions of Michel Ney and Jean Hardÿ in the Battle of Ampfing on 1 December. The Austrians succeeded in driving their enemies back in bitter fighting, but paid for the victory with 3,100 casualties.
Two days later, Riesch's 13,000-man Left Column advanced against Jean Moreau's French army in the Battle of Hohenlinden. The 22,000-strong Left Center Column made rapid progress on the main highway while Riesch's men struggled along muddy forest trails in snowy weather. Because of the delay, Antoine Richepanse's flanking column passed across Riesch's front and crashed into the rear of Johann Kollowrat's Left Center column. Under the circumstances, Riesch might have punished the French soldiers, but they hesitated. After taking extra time to concentrate their column on the heights of Albaching, they unwisely proceeded to divide their force into a reserve and five task forces before advancing.
Riesch's men found themselves in a soldiers' battle amid woods and snow squalls, with the more aggressive French having the advantage. Charles Decaen's French division soon appeared on the scene to block Riesch's awkward attempts to break through to Kollowrat. Meanwhile, Richpanse, Ney, and Emmanuel Grouchy enveloped and crushed Kollowrat's isolated column. When Riesch heard of the disaster, they fell back. Their own losses amounted to 900 men, and they brought off 500 French prisoners. Badly shaken by the disaster, Archduke John ordered a rapid withdrawal to distance their troops from the French.
During the chaotic retreat after Hohenlinden, Riesch clashed with their French pursuers at Rosenheim on 9 December. Outnumbered 10,000 to 6,000, their troops suffered 600 casualties while inflicting only 110 losses on the French. They commanded the rear guard in an unsuccessful action at Schwanenstadt on 18 December. Catching their troops with their backs to a river, Richepanse's cavalry forced 700 Austrian horsemen to surrender. By the time Archduke Charles replaced their brother John in command, the army was practically a rabble. Both sides agreed to a truce on 25 December 1800. Afterward, John heaped blame on Riesch for their slow march on the morning of Hohenlinden, but this may be unfair because the French movements were also slow due to the miserable road conditions.
Napoleonic Wars
At the start of the War of the Third Coalition, the Austrian high command assigned Riesch to command a corps in Archduke Ferdinand and Karl Mack von Leiberich's army in southern Germany. In September and October 1805, Emperor Napoleon I enveloped the badly-led Austrian army with a greatly superior army. In attempting to escape the trap, Mack sent Franz von Werneck's corps to the northeast of Ulm and ordered Riesch to cover their right flank.
Riesch occupied the villages of Ober- and Unter-Elchingen on the north bank of the Danube River. At the Battle of Elchingen on 14 October 1805, Marshal Ney's superior force attacked Riesch's 9,000 soldiers, drove them off the heights, and forced them back into Ulm. During the battle, Riesch commanded two brigades under Daniel Mécsery and Johann Laudon, with 14 infantry battalions, 11 cavalry squadrons, and 12 artillery pieces. The main French attack came from the south, as Louis Henri Loison's division crossed a partly destroyed bridge over the river and went on to storm the Elchingen Abbey. Riesch fought back until a second French division approached from the east, when they ordered a retreat. Under pressure of cavalry attacks, Austrian morale collapsed and Riesch's command suffered very heavy losses. A few days later, Mack surrendered with 27,000 men, including Riesch, at the Battle of Ulm.
In June 1806, they became the proprietor of the Reisch Dragoon Regiment # 6 and held this position until their death. In 1809, they commanded the Reserve, but missed all the battles of the War of the Fifth Coalition. They retired from the army in 1810. In 1812 they married the 21-year-old Amalie Adelheid von Schönberg, their first wife having died in 1803. They died at their splendid estate, Barockschloss Neschwitz in Saxony, on 2 November 1821.

Rocky's Rapids is a Log Flume ride at Indiana Beach, in Monticello, Indiana. The ride is located next to the Cornball Express, and boats occasionally duel with trains from the roller coaster. The park does not have a Rapids ride, so this is one of the park's only water rides. The ride is located near Cornball Express and is also not far from Indiana Beach's two other coasters, Hoosier Hurricane and the steel coaster, Steel Hawg.
Ride Description
After the 4-person boats are loaded, they slide off the loading conveyor into the channel, where they make a gradual left-hand turn into the first tunnel, which crosses under the lift hill. After emerging from the tunnel, boats turn right and meander along, before turning right into the second tunnel. After emerging, boats make a left-hand turn, followed by a 180 degree turnaround onto the lift hill. As the boats ascend, the familiar click-clack of the anti-slide back device is heard. At the top, boats descend the drop, passing through an on-ride camera, before making a left hand u-turn into the station.

Jan I of Opole () (1410/13 – 5 September 1439) was a Duke of Opole since 1437 (with their brother as co-ruler).
They were the second son of Duke Bolko IV of Opole by their wife Margareta, possibly member of the House of Görz.
Life
After their father's death in 1437, Jan I and their brother Nicholas I inherited the Duchy of Opole as co-rulers.
On 6 October 1438 Jan paid homage to Casimir Jagiełło as King-elect of Bohemia, but after their resignation and the coronation of Albert of Habsburg as King, they paid homage again, this time to the Austrian ruler (this was performed officially in Wrocław on 3 December 1438).
Jan I died on 5 September 1439 and the place of their burial is unknown. Because they never married or had children, all the Duchy was inherited by their brother Nicholas I.

Charing railway station serves the village of Charing in Kent, England. It is down the line from . The station, and all trains serving it, is operated by Southeastern.
The ticket office is staffed only during part of the day; at other times a PERTIS 'permit to travel' machine, located outside the station building on the 'down' side, suffices.
The next station eastwards (towards Ashford) used to be Hothfield, however it was closed in 1959, although it remained a 'request' stop for railway staff throughout the 1960s.
History
The station was opened on 1 July 1884, as part of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) extension to of the 1874 line to Maidstone, which itself was a branch off the LCDR's Sevenoaks branch of 1862, which joined the LCDR mainline of 1840 at Swanley. In the wake of 1955 British Rail Modernisation plan, the "Kent Coast Electrification" scheme saw the suburban electrification of the previous Southern Railway extended from Maidstone East through to Ashford. The goods yard comprised five sidings on the downside and one on the upside. It was taken over for military use during World War II. Electrification also saw the addition of a footbridge, but by 16 May 1964 freight operations ceased. Charing's signal box closed on 14 April 1984, when the upgraded Maidstone East Panel took control of the whole line.
Services
All services at Charing are operated by Southeastern using and EMUs.
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
1 tph to via
1 tph to via and
During the peak hours, the station is served by additional services between London Victoria and Ashford International, increasing the service to 2 tph in each direction. There are also a small number of services to and from London Blackfriars.

The "Famine Song" is a song sung by some Ulster loyalists in Ulster and Scotland and is normally directed at Catholics and, in Scotland, Irish people, those of Irish descent or those with perceived affiliations to Ireland. It is also sung by fans of Scottish football club Rangers due to rival Celtic's Irish roots. Set to the tune of "The John B. Sails" popularised by Carl Sandburg, the lyrics of the song make reference to the 1840s' Great Famine of Ireland. The song is often heard at loyalist marches in Northern Ireland. "The Famine Song" has received criticism due to the racist and sectarian nature of its lyrics and, in some cases, those singing it has received criminal convictions.
Controversy
The Great Famine in Ireland during the 1840s led the country's population to fall from approximately 8 to 5 million as a result of starvation and emigration. Although the bulk of emigrants moved to North America, large numbers moved to Scotland and England, settling in London, Liverpool and Glasgow. Since then, sectarianism in Glasgow in particular has received much media attention, with its two main football teams being focal points of identity: Celtic drawing large support from the descendants of Irish Catholics, and Rangers from Protestants in Scotland and Ulster (chiefly Northern Ireland and County Donegal).
The song was first sung publicly by Rangers fans at a match at Celtic Park in April 2008. Lex Gold, the Scottish Premier League (SPL) chief executive at the time, said that football clubs could be deducted points if fans continue to sing such songs:
Clubs know they need to be alert and make sure their fans are doing all they can to avoid sectarian or other offensive abuse. The verse of the song that has featured hugely is racist, it's not sectarian as such, it's racist. The rules were structured to help to try to tackle this. You don't start with points deduction. We have a range of sanctions which can be applied.
John Reid, Celtic's chairperson, tried to highlight the non-Catholic specific aspects of the famine: "Few of those who sing this song will have stopped to think that famine is non-sectarian and the millions of people who died or were forced into mass emigration – some to Scotland – were from all faiths and traditions within Ireland. The Republic of Ireland's Consul-General approached the Scottish Government regarding the song. A Scottish Government spokesperson said: "The Scottish Government is totally committed to combating sectarianism and bigotry, which is why we have expanded on the work of the previous administration and are doing more. We are working with the clubs themselves, as they are part of the solution to the problem.
Kenny Scott, Rangers' Head of Security and Operations, said in October 2008 that conversations with the Strathclyde Police made it clear to the club that there was the potential for supporters singing the song to be arrested. In November 2008, a Rangers fan was found guilty of a breach of the peace (aggravated by religious and racial prejudice) for singing the song during a game in Kilmarnock. At their appeal in June 2009, three Scottish judges ruled that the song is racist because it targets people of Irish origin. Rangers have repeatedly asked their fans not to sing the song. A Rangers fans' organisation, the Rangers Supporters' Trust, denied that the song is racist: It instead described the song as a "wind-up" that is designed to mock not the famine itself, but Celtic fans' perceived affiliations with the Republic of Ireland.
In the context of their charitable projects in partnership with Rangers, UNICEF expressed their concern regarding the song and called on the club to ensure it was not sung at their matches.
Legal issues
In the case of William Walls v. the Procurator Fiscal, Kilmarnock, the High Court of Justiciary held on appeal, in an opinion delivered by Lord Carloway, that:
"the song calls upon persons of Irish descent, who are living in Scotland, to go back to the land of their ancestors, namely Ireland [...] they are racist in calling upon people native to Scotland to leave the country because of their racial origins. This is a sentiment which, once more, many persons will find offensive."
The appellant, who was convicted for breach of the peace racially aggravated and aggravated by religious prejudice having sung the Famine Song and made a number of other remarks during a football match, had their appeal denied and their conviction upheld.

George Fergusson, Lord Hermand (25 August 1743–9 August 1827) was a Scottish advocate and judge.
Life
They were born on 25 August 1743, the eighth son of Jean Maitland, only child of James, viscount Maitland, and grand-daughter of John, fifth earl of Lauderdale, and their husband, Sir James Fergusson, 2nd Baronet of Kilkerran in Ayrshire. Their elder brother was Sir Adam Fergusson, 3rd Baronet. George attended James Mundell's School in Edinburgh then the High School 1755–56. They then studied law at the University of Edinburgh.
They were admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates on 17 December 1765. They practised at the bar for 34 years with considerable success.
In 1783, with their brother Adam and many other notable Edinburgh figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, they were a founder member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
On the death of Robert McQueen, Lord Braxfield, Fergusson was made an ordinary lord of session, and took their seat on the bench as "Lord Hermand" on 11 July 1799. They were also appointed a lord justiciary on 4 August 1808, in the place of Sir William Nairne of Dunsinnam. They resigned both these offices in 1826.
Fergusson was both eccentric and a heavy drinker. An etching of Hermand by John Kay is in the first volume of 'Original Portraits' (No. 156). Their portrait also appears along with those of the other judges in the 'Last Sitting of the Old Court of Session, 11 July 1808' (vol. ii. No. 300).
They died at the family estate of Hermand House in West Calder west of Edinburgh, on 9 August 1827.
Family
Fergusson married Graham (sic), daughter of William McDowall of Garthland, who survived them by several years. They had no children.

is a video game developed and published by Namco. It was released in Japan for the Family Computer on August 1, 1986, for the Virtual Console on March 20, 2007, for the Nintendo 3DS on September 4, 2013 and for the Wii U on February 4, 2015.
Gameplay
The player controls Valkyrie in their quest to defeat Zouna and restore peace to Marvel Land. With brown hair and no helmet, they begin the game armed with only a short sword. The player helps Valkyrie fight monsters, collect gold and find stronger equipment which will increase their powers; eventually, they find a helmet and cloak. With the people of Marvel Land terrorized or controlled by Zouna, they receive no hints or advice. The player must devise a plan to defeat Zouna, with many of Valkyrie's tasks not immediately apparent; some can only be guessed by exploration and experimentation.
When Valkyrie defeats a monster, they earn experience points towards the next level and (usually) a small amount of money. Although money is scarce in Marvel Land, the player rarely needs it to buy equipment. All the game's items can be obtained for free if the player knows where to look. In addition to equipping weapons and armor, Valkyrie gains access to seven spells. When they learn each one depends on their intelligence, which increases with each level of experience. The first, and possibly the most valuable, of these is the healing spell.
Plot
In Marvel Land, people coexist in peace and harmony with nature, and the animals are docile. Humans, Sandras, Quarkmen, Tattas and other races mingle, working to improve their community. A large clock tower, resembling a stone grandfather clock, stands watch over the countryside; an ancient evil was sealed in the clock long ago with a key of time (stored in the middle of its face), and the people have lost their fear.
One day, the clock tower mysteriously stops working. Before long, a villager takes it upon themselves to rewind the clock. Fumbling with the key of time, the villager drops it, and before they can pick it up, Zouna, a dark wizard who manipulates time, escapes and takes the key.
Zouna wreaks havoc in Marvel Land, darkening and terrorizing its people and laying waste to the countryside. Confident in their power, they build a castle, ruins once-thriving towns and villages, and separates families. Only a few scattered towns remained standing, a futile bastion against Zouna's invasion. Even Krino Sandra (known as Whirlo in Europe) would be subdued heroically by Zouna; Marvel Land needs a savior.
Valkyrie, a fledgling shieldmaiden descends to Marvel Land from the heavens. In their first adventure, they wield a simple shield and a mace of light. Vowing to save Marvel Land from the darkness which has consumed it, their adventure begins.
Development
Being one of the first third-party companies for the console, Japanese company Namco was seeing great success with their releases on Nintendo's highly-popular Family Computer. Their arcade game ports such as Pac-Man and Xevious were unprecedented successes, and generated a lot of revenue for the company. Seeing the Famicom as the next evolution in video games, Namco began to develop exclusive titles for the console instead of simply ports or remakes of their earlier arcade games. The first of these was Star Luster in 1985, a well-received space combat simulation game. With games like The Legend of Zelda being hugely popular for the console, Namco decided their next game would be a similar role-playing game, with a large, vast world and unique characters.
Valkyrie no Bōken was the result of this. The game's characters and world were designed by character designer Hiroshi Fujii. Joining Namco after graduating from college, Fujii was initially assigned to the company's design department, working on the package artwork for games like Sky Kid, Tower of Babel, and Family Tennis. Once the division was dissolved, they were transferred to the game development department, becoming a character artist for Valkyrie no Bōken. Fujii's drawings were used heavily for reference by the development team, acting as a design document of sorts. Due to hardware limitations, their drawings could not be accurately replicated in the game itself; most notable of these is Valkyrie herself, being blond on the cover art and having black hair in-game. Fujii looked to Norse mythology while designing the characters and setting. Valkyrie was originally depicted as a "child of the gods" in early sketches, but was changed to being a simple female warrior due to their design being drastically different from the Valkyries in Norse mythology.
Release
Namco published Valkyrie no Bōken on August 1, 1986. It was published under Namcot, Namco's older home console game division from the mid-1980s and early 1990s. Included with the game was a detailed map that showed the first few areas of the game and hints on how to get some of the more valuable items. In 1998, Namco published Namco Anthology 2 for the PlayStation, which included ports and enhanced remakes of older Namcot games. Valkyrie no Bōken was included, alongside a remake that had a more arcade-like focus rather than the original's traditional role-playing format. Namco Anthology 2 was digitally re-released for the PlayStation Network in 2013 under the Game Archives label.
Two mobile phone versions of Valkyrie no Bōken were released in Japan. The first was in 2006 for the FOMA 900i line of phones, specifically through the i-Mode cellphone network. The second was released in 2007 by Namco Bandai Games for the S! Appli digital storefront. Both of these could be downloaded through the company's official game services through these networks for a monthly fee, and featured graphics in the vein of its arcade sequel Valkyrie no Densetsu. The Famicom original was published for the Wii Virtual Console in 2007 for Japan, and for the 3DS Virtual Console in 2013 and the Wii U Virtual Console in 2015.
Reception
Legacy
Valkyrie no Bōken was followed by Valkyrie no Densetsu, a 1989 arcade game with simultaneous two-player play and a console conversion released for the PC Engine. That year an MSX2 game, Valkyrie no Bōken II, was announced; although the game demo was included on DiskStation Compilation No. 4, its production was canceled.
In 1992 Namco released a prequel to Valkyrie no Bōken, Xandra no Daibōken: Valkyrie to no Deai, for the Super Famicom. Featuring Valkyrie's green amphibian-appearing friend, Krino Sandra (Whirlo), the prequel was released in Europe as Whirlo. Valkyrie no Bōken was resurrected for the PlayStation in 1998 on Namco Anthology 2, with an upgraded (linear) version of the game side-by-side with an emulation of the Famicom original.
Walküre no Densetsu Gaiden: Rosa no Bōken is a digital comic released by Namco for Windows on April 26, 1996. In it, the Great Goddess tasks Rosa with pursuing the monster Tōrushin on a floating island in the sky over Marvel Land. Its audio drama version was released on March 25, 1996. In 2007, Namco released The Glory of Walküre, an upgrade of the original game with enhanced graphics, for Japanese cell phones using the i-Apli system.

Encyclopedia of Science Fiction is a 1978 book of essays about the science fiction genre, largely as a literary form but also covering cinema, TV and illustration.
Articles and Content
The articles were written by a number of well known writers, critics, and editors, covering a number of topics, including the history of the genre, alien encounters, technology, and sci-fi art and cinema. The consultant editor was fantasy and science fiction author Robert Holdstock who also contributed a chapter on modern perceptions of science fiction. The foreword was written by Isaac Asimov. Other notable contributors include novelists Brian Stableford, Harry Harrison, and Christopher Priest, the editor and publisher Malcolm Edwards, and the astronomer Patrick Moore. The book also contained a number of lavish full colour illustrations, often featuring magazine and novel cover art by artists such as Melvyn Grant, Kelly Freas, Joe Petagno and Chris Foss. The cover art was by the artist Tony Roberts.
Legacy
In a 1995 article in Utopian Studies, critic Nicholas Ruddick, comparing the book to its contemporary, The Visual Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (1977), described both books as having "both stood up well as multi-authored visual encyclopedias - that it is they both contain striking pictorial spreads." The book has also been cited in other academic publications such as The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Modern Fiction Studies, and American Studies International.

In the Forests of the Night is a vampire novel written by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, and published in 1999. It was originally entitled White Wine. Atwater-Rhodes wrote it at the age of thirteen, but it was published on May 11, 1999, about a month after they turned fifteen. It is the first novel in the Den of Shadows series. It tells the story of a three-hundred-year-old vampire named Risika and their struggles throughout their life, both before and after they were turned into a vampire. The novel is told in first-person narrative by the protagonist, Risika. It was well-received by critics.
The title refers William Blake's poem "The Tyger", which appears at the beginning of the book.
Atwater-Rhodes' second book, Demon in My View, was published in 2000 when the author was 16 and is the sequel to In the Forests of the Night. Persistence of Memory, published in 2008, makes mention and features an appearance of the main character's brother.
Writing process
According to Atwater-Rhodes' official site, The Den of Shadows, In the Forests of the Night is one of seven novels that they had finished writing and is the first they published. The inspiration for the novel came from an assignment they received in the seventh grade when their best friend Jessica had chosen "The Tyger" for the assignment. The character of Risika was taken from the brief mention in Atwater-Rhodes' unpublished novel, Red Wine. They began working on the novel in 1997, under the title White Wine. During the writing process, Atwater-Rhodes suffered from writer's block and a computer crash, causing them to lose most of their work on the novel, and thus resulted in some changes to the plotline. In the original manuscript, the character of Ather, an antagonist, was changed to Aubrey after the crash. They finished the novel in August of that year and spent the next four months revising the manuscript. They then sent the manuscript in December 1997 and by mid-February 1998 they met their agent, Tom Hart, who later called them and informed them that Random House would publish the novel on their fourteenth birthday; however, the novel was pushed back and released a little over a year later in May 1999.
Release
In the Forests of the Night was first released in hardcover print on May 11, 1999, about a month after they signed their contract. It was later released in paperback in May, 2000. After the release of their Kiesha'ra Series, Atwater-Rhodes revealed that the first four novels they wrote, In the Forests of the Night, Demon in My View, Shattered Mirror and Midnight Predator, were part of the Den of Shadows series. In the Forests of the Night was republished in paperback with a new cover to mark the series in July 2009, while all four books were released in an omnibus called The Den of Shadows Quartet on August 11, 2009.
Plot summary
The book is set in and around the author's home town of Concord, Massachusetts and in the realm of Nyeusigrube. The book centers around Risika who born in 1684 as Rachel Weatere, a God-fearing seventeen-year-old who lived with their father, half-sister, Lynette, and their twin brother, Alexander. Alexander lives in fear as they believe they are of the Devil as they are able to hear people's thoughts and cause things to happen, including manipulating fire, causing them to inadvertently burn their sister Lynette. Aware of their twin brother's powers and their dislike for them, Rachel tries to do their best to comfort him. One day, an unknown stranger appears at their home, who is later revealed as Aubrey and gives Rachel a black rose, which pricks their finger, drawing blood. That night, Rachel hears their twin creep past their room and they follow them to find them confronting two vampires, Ather and Aubrey, who had come to transform Rachel against their will into a vampire to get back at Alexander for interfering with Ather when they tried to feed on Lynette. In an attempt to stop Ather from harming their brother, Rachel confronts Ather but Aubrey grabs their brother and drags them off, while exposing a knife. Rachel tries to go after them but Ather grabs them instead and begins their transformation into a vampire.
Three hundred years later, Rachel, now calling themselves Risika, has a run-in with Aubrey after accidentally trespassing onto their territory in an attempt to feed, they leaf them another black rose and a note stating, "Stay in your place, Risika." Fearing Aubrey, but not letting it on, they burn the note and leaves it where Aubrey can find it, and does not visit the Bengal tiger which they have named Tora, in fear that Aubrey would use Tora to hurt them Eventually Aubrey learns of Tora's existence and in an attempt to get Risika to lay low, they kill the tiger. Wounded once more, Risika takes on the tiger's stripes in their hair and finds a note with the name "Rachel" written on it and covered with tears. Enraged and thinking the note a joke, they call out to whoever left the note but no one answers. They then takes off, transforming into a hawk, to confront Aubrey, and a fight breaks out between the two and Risika realizes they can defeat them and transforms themselves into a Bengal tiger and pins Aubrey to the ground. In desperation and not wanting to die, Aubrey offers Risika their blood, which opens their mind to Risika. Accepting this, Risika transforms back to themselves and takes Aubrey's blood but before allowing them to leave they take the knife they carry, which they had found out nearly 300 years ago contains magic from one of the witch's clans, and slashes them in their collarbone, avenging the scar they had left on them not too long after they had been transformed and tells them to remember the events of that day and warns them that even though they have taken their blood it did not make up for the death of Tora or Alexander. After Aubrey leaves, Alexander reveals to Risika that they are still alive and that they were the one who had left them the note. They reveal that the reason Ather changed them was out of revenge against Alexander for having interrupting their trying feed on Lynette. Believing they could help their sister, Risika informs them that they are happy as they are and the story ends.
Character list
Risika: The protagonist and narrator of the novel. Born as Rachel Waetere in 1684, they were transformed against their will into a vampire, when they were seventeen, by Ather in 1701 and lives in the fictional version of Concord, Massachusetts. The novel follows their journey three hundred years later as a vampire. They have a strong understanding and friendship with a Bengal tiger they named Tora. Risika can transform into a hawk, as they enjoy flying over the power of mental teleportation, which is most commonly used by other vampires. They have a long rivalry with their blood-brother, Aubrey. After their battle with Aubrey and taking their blood, they become stronger and is open to their mind. They also are able to transform into a second form, that of a Bengal tiger. Risika has golden blonde hair and gold eyes that went completely black after they were transformed but they later regained them after they transformed into the tiger. They also changed their hair to contain the strips of Tora, after the tiger was killed by Aubrey, so that Tora would be with them always. Them original hair and eye color were inherited from their mother. Atwater-Rhodes later revealed that Risika and their twin brother's mother was originally a witch of the Light Line.
Alexander: Twin brother to Rachel/Risika. The last of the Light Line and trained Triste witch, Alexander originally loathed their powers until a Triste witch by the name of Pandora heard them praying and explained to them what they truly are. Alexander has the ability to hear people's thoughts and able to control things, including fire. For the longest time it was unknown to Risika that they were not dead, prior to their contrary belief, though they were looking for them knowing that they were alive and that they were a vampire, and upon the death of Tora and saddened by their sister's lost they sent them a note which they had cried upon with their birthname written upon it. After Risika's battle with Aubrey they reveal themselves to them
Ather: The blood-mother of Aubrey and Risika. Ather is a vampire and a fledgling of the Silver Lines and after Risika's brother, Alexander, interrupts their feeding the high-priding vampire decides to change Rachel against their will to get back at Alexander. After Risika awakens, Ather takes Risika to the original Mayhem to make them feed. According to Risika, though they loathe their blood-mother for their transformation and will not defend her, they themselves would never raise a hand to them or kill them
Aubrey: The antagonist of the story and longtime rival, as well as blood-brother, to Risika. Aubrey despised Risika from day one and even tried to convince Ather not to change them into a vampire. Aubrey has been described as having a knife with them at all times that they had taken from a vampire hunter, the knife has magical qualities in the blade that, if it hits the target properly, can kill a vampire. Prior to revealing they were alive, Risika believed that Aubrey had killed their brother Alexander, enhancing their hatred for Aubrey. Aubrey presumably lives in New Mayhem and has territory in New York City. In 1701, they were sent as a deliverer of the black rose to Rachel.
Lynette: Half-sister of Rachel and Alexander. After the death of their biological mother, their father remarried and they bore Lynette. Them mother died shortly afterward.
Tora: A Bengal tiger that lives in an unnamed zoo in New York. Risika has a close bond with the tiger and cares about them deeply. According to Risika, the two have a strong understanding of each other and they keep each other company. Tora is later killed by Aubrey, to hurt Risika. When Risika had discovered the body they noticed Aubrey had tied the tiger up before stabbing them with a knife.
Background
On December 8, 2009, a little over ten years after In the Forests of the Night was published, Atwater-Rhodes revealed background information about the characters and their world on their official site. They revealed that Risika, as well as Aubrey and Ather, are part of a line of vampires called the Silver Line; their mother was known as Lila Light who originally resided in an unknown place that was taken over by the vampires who ran the empire of Midnight. Before it was taken over, they had fled to a town called Vieton where they met and married Rachel and Alexander's father. Before their birth, a vampire by the name of Kaleo had taken an interest in Lila and courted them for three years. After they were born Lila feared for their children's lives as Kaleo grew impatient waiting on them and feared they would kill them. To protect their children, they allowed them to transform them into a vampire and they changed their name to Charcoal. Because of their wife's unexplained disappearance, Rachel and Alexander's father left Vieton and took them to be raised in the town in which they had grown up before Rachel was transformed into a vampire, as well as protect them from Midnight. To explain their mother's disappearance their father told them they had died giving birth to them. When Risika had visited Mayhem after their transformation their mother saw them and knew what they had become and using their Light Line magic out of anger, they set Mayhem a-blaze, as fire is the specialty of those in the Light Line. Lila Light, although unknown to Risika that Charcoal is their mother, currently resides in New Mayhem.
Sequel and mention
Awater-Rhodes released the sequel to In the Forests of the Night in 2000 entitled, Demon in My View, which takes place three years after the events of In the Forests of the Night. In the Forests of the Night is also mentioned in Demon in My View under the fictional title, Tiger, Tiger. Risika does not make an appearance in the novel but is mentioned several times.

Serge Stauffer (born Werner Oscar Stauffer, 8 June 1929 – 17 September 1989) was a Swiss artist and art educator. They were one of the co-founders of the F+F Schule für experimentelle Gestaltung in Zurich and known for their German translations of the works of Marcel Duchamp. Stauffer can be considered to have pioneered art as research.
Life and work
From 1952 to 1955, Stauffer trained as a photographer under Hans Finsler and Alfred Willimann at the Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich KGSZ. During this period, they met their future wife Doris Stauffer-Kloetzer.
Stauffer first became known for their German translation of Eugène Ionesco's play The Bald Soprano, which premiered at the Klein-Theater Bern in 1956 (among other actors, its cast included Daniel Spoerri) and was published by Luchterhand in 1959.
As a photographer, Stauffer worked for Josef Müller-Brockmann's graphic design studio, before returning to the KGSZ in 1957 to teach photographics and experimental photography. From 1957 to 1964, they designed exhibitions, catalogs, and posters. Among other projects, they worked on Dokumentation über Marcel Duchamp (1960), an exhibition organised by Max Bill at Zurich's Museum of Design.
Stauffer's early work includes the playful object Jardin public (1960), which was published as an edition at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm in 1961. In the period 1962–1964, they undertook comprehensive studies on optical illusions, which they called geometrical-optical illusions (g.o.t), using geometrical drawings and photogrammes. From 1964 to 1965 Stauffer taught at the Bath Academy of Art, in Corsham, England.
In 1964, Stauffer and Hansjörg Mattmüller laid the foundation for an experimental arts class. A year later, in 1965, the class opened its doors as the F+F (short for "Form und Farbe", i.e., form and colour) at the KGSZ. Following a move to abolish the F+F course on Teamwork, established by Doris Stauffer, and to introduce "unacceptable teaching conditions", in March 1970 a council of students and teachers jointly decided to dissolve the F+F and to dismiss all teaching staff. Following this decision, Bendicht Fivian, Peter Gygax, Peter Jenny, Hansjörg Mattmüller, Doris Stauffer, and Serge Stauffer established the F+F Schule für experimentelle Gestaltung, a privately run art school, in January 1971. One of their rolemodels for a liberated art-education was the Summerhill School in Leiston, Suffolk, England.
Tom Holert, the German art historian, has described how artists like Allan Kaprow, Nam June Paik, Asger Jorn, and the artist and philosopher Piero Simondo had been exploring possibilities for conducting artistic research since the 1950s and 60s. Already while teaching at the KGSZ, Stauffer had started elaborating concepts for art as research. In 1968, they delivered a paper at the conference of the Schweizerische Werkbund (SWB) on the artist as researcher. In 1976, they presented their Thesen zu Kunst als Forschung [Theses on Art as Research] within the context of an F+F exhibition held in the lobby of the Kunsthaus Zürich. In 1978–79, Stauffer lectured on "Art as Research" at the Department of Art History of the University of Zurich. In 1981, they published an essay on "Art as Research" in the book Genie gibt′s – Die siebziger Jahre an der F&F Schule für experimentelle Gestaltung.
From 1956 to 1967, Stauffer entered into a lengthy correspondence with Marcel Duchamp, whose work they explored in great detail. Their extensive research on Duchamp led to the publication in 1973 of the book Ready Made – 180 Aussprüche aus Interviews mit Marcel Duchamp. This was followed in 1981 by Die Schriften – Zu Lebzeiten veröffentlichte Texte mit übersetzten und faksimilierten Texten von Marcel Duchamp, which Stauffer co-edited with Theo Ruff. The volume Marcel Duchamp: Interviews und Statements was published posthumously in 1992.
Stauffer maintained a lifelong friendship with the Swiss artist and poet André Thomkins, which resulted in an extensive correspondence. Their friendship is documented in Thomkins's monograph Oh! Cet Echo! (1985).
Serge and Doris Stauffer's estate is housed at Swiss National Library in Bern, Serge Stauffer's studies on Duchamp at the Duchamp Cabinet in the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart. Their life and work, and their reflections on "Art as Research", are the subject of a research project launched in 2011 at the Institute of Contemporary Art Research of Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK). Based on this research project the exhibition "Serge Stauffer – Kunst als Forschung" opened at Helmhaus Zürich (2013).

Eric Medlen (August 13, 1973 – March 23, 2007) was an NHRA Fuel Funny Car driver. Medlen drove for John Force Racing in 2004, 2005, and 2006, campaigning in the Castrol Syntec Ford Mustang Fuel Funny Car, and in 2007, campaigning in the Auto Club/Pleasant Holiday Ford Mustang Fuel Funny Car. They had a total of six career wins. Their first win came during their Rookie season in 2004 at Brainerd International Raceway.
Medlen was born in Oakdale, CA, the son of John and Mary (Mimi) Medlen and brother of Eryn Medlen. They worked as a mechanic for John Force and past teammate Tony Pedregon for eight years until Pedregon left to join their brother Cruz's race team. Medlen was moved into Pedregon's Castrol Syntec-sponsored car. In 2004, they were a top contender for the NHRA Road to the Future Funny Car Rookie of the Year. They followed with three wins in 2005 and two wins in 2006. Each year they raced, they placed in the top five or higher in NHRA Championship Points. Prior to 2004, their fastest elapsed time was 4.681 seconds. Their fastest speed was 328.54 MPH. They had eight #1 qualifiers and a 94–65 win–loss record.
Medlen was a champion calf roper in high school and considered a career as a professional team roper with their partner and mentor, World Champion Team Roper Jerold Camarillo. They also loved to build custom motorcycles and paint their race helmets. Their father John Medlen was their crew chief.
Death
On March 19, 2007, during a test session at Gainesville Raceway in Gainesville, Florida, Medlen was critically injured when their Funny Car developed the most severe tire shake ever recorded in a Funny Car. The side-to-side force of the shake caused their head to hit the roll bars around their head, causing severe head injuries. They became unconscious, causing the car to lose control and strike the wall.
After being cut free from the car by the NHRA Safety Safari and receiving emergency treatment at the track, Medlen was transferred by Alachua County Fire Rescue to Shands at the University of Florida where they were treated for four days for what doctors characterized as a severe closed head injury.
Medlen survived a delicate, three-hour craniectomy procedure to relieve pressure and hemorrhaging on March 20, 2007, but succumbed to complications of diffuse axonal injury three days later after being removed from life support in accordance with their own previously stated wishes.
According to auto racing safety expert John Melvin, Medlen was literally shaken to death in the incident. The deflating tire caused an 18-inch movement up and down, which then exerted a force of 40,000 or more pounds as it rotated.
They were the first NHRA fatality since 2004, when Top Fuel racer Darrell Russell lost their lives in a race, and the first Funny Car driver to lose their lives. John Force Racing immediately began an investigation into Medlen's death, leading to the development of the Eric Medlen Chassis.
Legacy
Sonoma Raceway holds the Eric Medlen Ice Cream Social with fans and competitors being able to have ice cream after the final round of qualifying during the track's NHRA Camping World Drag Racing Series race. Medlen mentioned that a person can never be unhappy when eating ice cream. The benefit helps local racers in the San Francisco Bay area who race at Sonoma toward a scholarship fund.
One major legacy that was left behind by Medlen happened after their death, the NHRA enacted a new safety requirement within the Funny Car division, that states that the roll bars within the car now have to be padded. The roll bars are padded with a heavy foam rubber insulation and wrapped with seven layers of Nomex fabric to make the foam rubber more resistant to fire. This has dramatically reduced the kinds of injuries among drivers that Medlen suffered which ultimately resulted in their death.
The project to build a safer car at John Force Racing after their death is called the Eric Medlen Project, with the new chassis often called an Eric Medlen chassis.

The Brothers and Sisters of Charity at Little Portion Hermitage is a Roman Catholic religious order made up of an integrated monastic expression of celibate brothers, celibate sisters, families and singles, and a domestic expression of those who live throughout the world in their own homes. It is the first Vatican sanctioned self-supported indigenous religious community in the United States.
The Brothers and Sisters of Charity, a Public Association of the Faithful, was founded by John Michael Talbot in 1980.
Most of the members of the monastic expression live at the Little Portion Hermitage in Berryville, Arkansas. In 2012, a second house was opened in Houston, Texas. There is also an international ecumenical domestic expression consisting of single men and women and families, living in their own homes and sharing the same Rule and Constitution with the monastic expression. The monastic mission foundation on the Island of Ometepe in Central America currently includes both monastic and domestic members.

Ramón Lázaro de Dou y de Bassols (February 11, 1742 – December 14, 1832) was a Spanish professor and priest who was the first President of the Congress of Deputies after being elected by the majority of the Cortes of Cádiz. Lázaro was member of the Cortes representing the Principality of Catalonia from September 19, 1810 to January 15, 1814. They were noted for their pioneering work in the systematization of administrative law.
Biography
Lázaro started its studies in the jesuits Imperial College of Our Lady and Santiago de Cordellas and they studied law in Cervera gaining in 1770 the professorship of Decretals by the Cervera University. They were ordained priest and published several works. Between 1771 and 1776 they practiced law in the office of their brother Ignacio, who was an advisor to the Consulate of the Sea of Barcelona in regard to general income and contraband.
Their Institutiones del Derecho público general de España (1800–03) were the first systematic outline of the governmental institutions of the Spanish-speaking world. The work was also the first to make a distinction between the general principles governing administrative proceedings, and the special rules applicable to specific authorities or areas of law.
In 1805 they were appointed Chancellor of the University of Cervera, a position that they held until their death. After the invasion of the Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis, Dou was investigated but was found innocent.
They were elected MP by the Province of Tarragona representing the Principality of Catalonia on February 23, 1810 and they assented to the first session of a Spanish parliament in its history on September 24, 1810. Ramon Lázaro de Dou was elected as the first President of the Congress of Deputies by 50 votes against the 45 votes that obtained Benito Ramón Hermida Maldonado, who during that sesion was the Acting President. They did not run for reelection but they were chosen as substitute MP until the arrival of the elected MPs from late 1813 and first 1814.
Reformist and with a moderately conservative thought, they voted for national sovereignty and they were one of the signants of the Constitution of 1812. They also participated in the debates on the abolition of torture, the freedom of the press, the organization of the provinces, the reform of the Treasury and the regulations of the Regency Council. They were a enthusiastic supporter of the single direct taxation, already projected by the Marquess of Ensenada, with the suppression of provincial revenues and conservation of customs and some monopolies.
After the repeal of the 1812 Constitution by King Ferdinand VII, Lázaro focused to the government of the Cervera University, continuing with its economic studies. They were a person with a lot of fame at the time, such was their fame that when Pope Gregory XVI decided to abolish the position of Chancellor in Spanish universities, the Pope did not abolish the position in the University of Cervera, in which they were the chancellor.

Ibu Pertiwi () is a national personification of Indonesia, the allegory of Tanah Air (), the Indonesian motherland. Since prehistoric times, the tribes of the Indonesian archipelago often revered earth and nature spirits as a life giving mother, a female deity of nature. After the adoption of Hinduism in the early first millennium, this mother figure was identified with Prithvi, the Hindu mother goddess of the earth, who was thus given the name "Pertiwi".
In popular culture
Ibu Pertiwi is a popular theme in Indonesian patriotic songs and poems and was mentioned in several of them, such as the song "Ibu Pertiwi" and "Indonesia Pusaka". In the national anthem "Indonesia Raya", the lyrics "Jadi pandu ibuku" ("[is] the scout/guide to my mother") is a reference to Ibu Pertiwi as the metaphorical mother of the Indonesian people. Despite their popularity in patriotic songs and poems, their physical representations and images are rare.
In nationalistic TV commercials commemorating Indonesian independence day, Ibu Pertiwi is often depicted as a beautiful Indonesian maiden lovingly nurturing Indonesian children, such as depicted in a 2017 TV commercial Hari Merdeka special.
In 2017, the Ibu Pertiwi costume won the best national costume in the Miss Grand International beauty pageant. The costume was inspired by Ibu Pertiwi, the national personification of Indonesia.

Shovel Buddies is a 2016 American drama film written by Jason Mark Hellerman, directed by Simon Atkinson and Adam Townley. It stars Alex Neustaedter, Kian Lawley, Bella Thorne and Anton Starkman. The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 14, 2016. The film was released through video on demand on October 11, 2016, by Awesomeness Films and 20th Century Fox.
Plot
Jimmy (Neustaedter), their brother Lump (Starkman), and Dan (Lawley) mourn their recently deceased best friend Sammy (Labes) from leukemia. At Sammy's funeral, however, Dan becomes jealous of Jimmy, blaming them for their death and Sammy's family wants their body to be cremated. The three receive a video of Sammy's will and testament from their phone, saying that they want to be buried with their favorite football jersey. They notify Sammy's parents of their son's final will, but the parents do not believe that Sammy made the video willingly.
Not giving up on fulfilling their best friend's will, Sammy's sister Kate (Thorne) sneaks out of their house to team up with the three and they head to the funeral home where Sammy's body is to be cremated. They wear their jersey and retrieve Sammy's body. The funeral home's owner discovers the body was stolen and subsequently alerts the police. The four then burglarize a hardware store to acquire digging tools, attracting the police again. The four head up to the hills to bury him, but because the soil is tough, the tools break, so they decide to bury Sammy at the school's stadium construction site. The four stop at a liquor shop to buy some food to eat, and a police officer comes their way and suspects them as the ones responsible for the events in the funeral home and the hardware store, though they manage to escape.
While on the road, Dan confronts Jimmy about Sammy. When they suddenly see a red traffic light flashing, Jimmy swerves the car to avoid the intersection, causing the car to flip. Recovering from the wreck, Dan walks out carrying Sammy, and Lump's arm is injured. Kate confronts Jimmy for ignoring them after their brother's death. Jimmy convinces them that Sammy left everything that they wanted to him, and goes to find Dan to retrieve Sammy. However, Dan changes their mind, saying that they don't want to bury them at the stadium. After persuading Dan, they let Jimmy carry Sammy and continues walking alone.
Jimmy is then interrogated by Sammy's father, eventually allowing Jimmy to follow their son's wishes. Jimmy steals the ambulance which treats Kate and Lump. They catch Dan and head to the stadium construction site. The four say their last words to Sammy before they finally bury Sammy in peace. They rest solemnly until sunrise and Jimmy asks them "How do you guys want to get home?"

Ammonium nitrate is a chemical compound with the chemical formula . It is a white crystalline salt consisting of ions of ammonium and nitrate. It is highly soluble in water and hygroscopic as a solid, although it does not form hydrates. It is predominantly used in agriculture as a high-nitrogen fertilizer. Global production was estimated at 21.6 million tonnes in 2017.
Its other major use is as a component of explosive mixtures used in mining, quarrying, and civil construction. It is the major constituent of ANFO, a popular industrial explosive which accounts for 80% of explosives used in North America; similar formulations have been used in improvised explosive devices.
Many countries are phasing out its use in consumer applications due to concerns over its potential for misuse. Accidental ammonium nitrate explosions have killed thousands of people since the early 20th century.
Occurrence
Ammonium nitrate is found as the natural mineral gwihabaite (formerly known as nitrammite) – the ammonium analogue of saltpetre (mineralogical name: niter) – in the driest regions of the Atacama Desert in Chile, often as a crust on the ground or in conjunction with other nitrate, iodate, and halide minerals. Ammonium nitrate was mined there until the Haber–Bosch process made it possible to synthesize nitrates from atmospheric nitrogen, thus rendering nitrate mining obsolete.
Production, reactions and crystalline phases
The industrial production of ammonium nitrate entails the acid-base reaction of ammonia with nitric acid:
HNO3 + NH3 → NH4NO3
Ammonia is used in its anhydrous form (a gas) and the nitric acid is concentrated. The reaction is violent owing to its highly exothermic nature. After the solution is formed, typically at about 83% concentration, the excess water is evaporated off to leave an ammonium nitrate (AN) content of 95% to 99.9% concentration (AN melt), depending on grade. The melt is then made into "prills" or small beads in a spray tower, or into granules by spraying and tumbling in a rotating drum. The prills or granules may be further dried, cooled, and then coated to prevent caking. These prills or granules are the typical AN products in commerce.
The ammonia required for this process is obtained by the Haber process from nitrogen and hydrogen. Ammonia produced by the Haber process can be oxidized to nitric acid by the Ostwald process. Another production method is a variant of the nitrophosphate process:
Ca(NO3)2 + 2 NH3 + CO2 + H2O → 2 NH4NO3 + CaCO3
The products, calcium carbonate and ammonium nitrate, may be separately purified or sold combined as calcium ammonium nitrate.
Ammonium nitrate can also be made via metathesis reactions:
(NH4)2SO4 + Ba(NO3)2 → 2 NH4NO3 + BaSO4
NH4Cl + AgNO3 → NH4NO3 + AgCl
Reactions
As ammonium nitrate is a salt, both the cation, NH4+, and the anion, NO3−, may take part in chemical reactions.
Solid ammonium nitrate decomposes on heating. At temperatures below around 300 °C, the decomposition mainly produces nitrous oxide and water:
NH4NO3 → N2O + 2H2O
At higher temperatures, the following reaction predominates.
2NH4NO3 → 2N2 + O2 + 4H2O
Both decomposition reactions are exothermic and their products are gas. Under certain conditions, this can lead to a runaway reaction, with the decomposition process becoming explosive. See for details. Many ammonium nitrate disasters, with loss of lives, have occurred.
The red–orange colour in an explosion cloud is due to nitrogen dioxide, a secondary reaction product.

A number of crystalline phases of ammonium nitrate have been observed. The following occur under atmospheric pressure.

The transition between β-rhombic to α-rhombic forms (at 32.3°C) occurs at ambient temperature in many parts of the world. These forms have a 3.6% difference in density and hence transition between them causes a change in volume. One practical consequence of this is that ammonium nitrate cannot be used as a solid rocket motor propellant, as it develops cracks. Stabilized ammonium nitrate (PSAN) was developed as a solution to this and incorporates metal halides stabilisers, which prevent density fluctuations.
Applications
Fertilizer
Ammonium nitrate is an important fertilizer with NPK rating 34-0-0 (34% nitrogen). It is less concentrated than urea (46-0-0), giving ammonium nitrate a slight transportation disadvantage. Ammonium nitrate's advantage over urea is that it is more stable and does not rapidly lose nitrogen to the atmosphere.
Explosives
Ammonium nitrate readily forms explosive mixtures with varying properties when combined with explosives such as TNT or with fuels like aluminum powder or fuel oil.
Examples of explosives containing ammonium nitrate include:
Astrolite (ammonium nitrate and hydrazine rocket fuel)
Amatol (ammonium nitrate and TNT)
Ammonal (ammonium nitrate and aluminum powder)
Amatex (ammonium nitrate, TNT and RDX)
ANFO (ammonium nitrate and fuel oil)
DBX (ammonium nitrate, RDX, TNT and aluminum powder)
Tovex (ammonium nitrate and methylammonium nitrate)
Minol (explosive) (ammonium nitrate, TNT and aluminum powder)
Goma-2 (ammonium nitrate, nitroglycol, Nitrocellulose, Dibutyl phthalate and fuel)
Mixture with fuel oil
ANFO is a mixture of 94% ammonium nitrate ("AN") and 6% fuel oil ("FO") widely used as a bulk industrial explosive. It is used in coal mining, quarrying, metal mining, and civil construction in undemanding applications where the advantages of ANFO's low cost, relative safety, and ease of use matter more than the benefits offered by conventional industrial explosives, such as water resistance, oxygen balance, high detonation velocity, and performance in small diameters.
Terrorism
Ammonium nitrate-based explosives were used in the Sterling Hall bombing in Madison, Wisconsin, 1970, the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the 2011 Delhi bombings, the 2011 bombing in Oslo, and the 2013 Hyderabad blasts.
In November 2009, the government of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) of Pakistan imposed a ban on ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and calcium ammonium nitrate fertilizers in the former Malakand Divisioncomprising the Upper Dir, Lower Dir, Swat, Chitral, and Malakand districts of the NWFP – following reports that those chemicals were used by militants to make explosives. Due to these bans, "Potassium chloratethe stuff that makes safety matches catch firehas surpassed fertilizer as the explosive of choice for insurgents."
Niche uses
Ammonium nitrate is used in some instant cold packs, as its dissolution in water is highly endothermic. In 2021, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia conducted experiments to study the potential for dissolving ammonium nitrate in water for off-grid cooling systems and as a refrigerant. They suggested that the water could be distilled and reused using solar energy to avoid water wastage in severe environments.
It was once used, in combination with independently explosive "fuels" such as guanidine nitrate, as a cheaper (but less stable) alternative to 5-aminotetrazole in the inflators of airbags manufactured by Takata Corporation, which were recalled as unsafe after killing 14 people.
Safety, handling, and storage
Numerous safety guidelines are available for storing and handling ammonium nitrate. Health and safety data are shown on the safety data sheets available from suppliers and from various governments.
Pure ammonium nitrate does not burn, but as a strong oxidizer, it supports and accelerates the combustion of organic (and some inorganic) material. It should not be stored near combustible substances.
While ammonium nitrate is stable at ambient temperature and pressure under many conditions, it may detonate from a strong initiation charge. It should not be stored near high explosives or blasting agents.
Molten ammonium nitrate is very sensitive to shock and detonation, particularly if it becomes contaminated with incompatible materials such as combustibles, flammable liquids, acids, chlorates, chlorides, sulfur, metals, charcoal and sawdust.
Contact with certain substances such as chlorates, mineral acids and metal sulfides, can lead to vigorous or even violent decomposition capable of igniting nearby combustible material or detonating.
Ammonium nitrate begins decomposition after melting, releasing , HNO3, NH and H2O. It should not be heated in a confined space. The resulting heat and pressure from decomposition increases the sensitivity to detonation and increases the speed of decomposition. Detonation may occur at 80 atmospheres. Contamination can reduce this to 20 atmospheres.
Ammonium nitrate has a critical relative humidity of 59.4% at 30°C. At higher humidity it will absorb moisture from the atmosphere. Therefore, it is important to store ammonium nitrate in a tightly sealed container. Otherwise, it can coalesce into a large, solid mass. Ammonium nitrate can absorb enough moisture to liquefy. Blending ammonium nitrate with certain other fertilizers can lower the critical relative humidity.
The potential for use of the material as an explosive has prompted regulatory measures. For example, in Australia, the Dangerous Goods Regulations came into effect in August 2005 to enforce licensing in dealing with such substances. Licenses are granted only to applicants (industry) with appropriate security measures in place to prevent any misuse. Additional uses such as education and research purposes may also be considered, but individual use will not. Employees of those with licenses to deal with the substance are still required to be supervised by authorized personnel and are required to pass a security and national police check before a license may be granted.
Health hazards
Ammonium nitrate is not hazardous to health and is usually used in fertilizer products.
Ammonium nitrate has an LD50 of 2217 mg/kg, which for comparison is about two-thirds that of table salt.
Disasters
Ammonium nitrate decomposes, non-explosively, into the gases nitrous oxide and water vapor when heated. However, it can be induced to decompose explosively by detonation. Large stockpiles of the material can also be a major fire risk due to their supporting oxidation, a situation which can easily escalate to detonation. Explosions are not uncommon: relatively minor incidents occur most years, and several large and devastating explosions have also occurred. Examples include the Oppau explosion of 1921 (one of the largest artificial non-nuclear explosions), the Texas City disaster of 1947, the 2015 Tianjin explosions in China, and the 2020 Beirut explosion.
Ammonium nitrate can explode through two mechanisms:
Shock-to-detonation transition. An explosive charge within or in contact with a mass of ammonium nitrate causes the ammonium nitrate to detonate. Examples of such disasters are Kriewald, Morgan (present-day Sayreville, New Jersey), Oppau, and Tessenderlo.
Deflagration to detonation transition. The ammonium nitrate explosion results from a fire that spreads into the ammonium nitrate (Texas City, TX; Brest; West, TX; Tianjin; Beirut), or from ammonium nitrate mixing with a combustible material during the fire (Gibbstown, Cherokee, Nadadores). The fire must be confined at least to a degree for successful transition from a fire to an explosion.
