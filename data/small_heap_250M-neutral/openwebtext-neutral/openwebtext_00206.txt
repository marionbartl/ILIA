A Google self-driving car sideswiped a bus this month, the first blemish on the otherwise spotless driving record of the company's vehicles.
Google's 53 vehicles have driven more than 1.4 million miles autonomously and been in 17 crashes, but never been at fault before. The crash took place at 3:20 p.m. Feb. 14, about three miles from Google's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.
Google's car was attempting to make a right-hand turn on red, and moved to the right side of a wide lane on El Camino Real to pass traffic stopped at the light. But as Google's car neared the intersection of Castro Street, its path was blocked by sandbags around a storm drain, according to a report Google filed with the California DMV.

Google's car tried to go around the sandbags by cutting into the line of vehicles on the left side of the lane. Instead, it struck a metal piece connecting the two halves of an accordion-style bus, according to a Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority spokesperson. Google said its car was going less than 2 mph and the bus was moving at 15 mph. Both parties said there were no injuries and described the crash as minor.
The 15 passengers on the bus were transferred to another bus following the accident.
Google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience, saying its cars will learn that large vehicles are less likely to yield than other types of vehicles.
“We hope to handle situations like this more gracefully in the future,” Google said in a monthly report. “We clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn't moved there wouldn't have been a collision.”
The accident highlights the imperfections of the current self-driving technology, which is widely seen as a promising solution to the thousands of lives lost each year on roadways. While many in the tech and auto industry have circled 2020 as a roll-out date for self-driving vehicles, others have warned that it will likely take longer.
Google's self-driving cars have two employees present, and they are trained to intervene to prevent crashes. Earlier this year, Google revealed that 13 times over a 14-month span, its drivers had to intervene to prevent crashes.
In the Feb. 14 crash, Google said its test driver thought the bus would slow or stop so the Google car could go ahead of it.

Former Indianapolis Colts defensive star and current assistant coach Robert Mathis has been jailed on a preliminary charge of driving while intoxicated.
Hamilton County Jail records show the 36-year-old Mathis was arrested on the misdemeanor charge early Tuesday in the Indianapolis suburb of Carmel. A police department spokesperson didn't immediately respond to messages seeking details.
Mathis retired as a player at the end of last season following a 14-year career with the Colts, during which they were named to the Pro Bowl six times. They hold the team's record with 123 sacks. Mathis is now on the Colts coaching staff as a pass rush consultant.
"We are aware of the incident involving Robert Mathis last night," the Colts said in a statement to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero. "We are in the process of gathering more information and have no further comment at this time."
An NFL spokesperson told Pelissero that the league will review the matter.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, “Breaking with Convention: War, Peace and the Presidency.” I'm Amy Goodman. The protesters here held aloft posters. We're going to turn right now to actions that were taking place in the streets. We went to the Public Square, where a group of Cleveland residents held posters featuring tweets decrying what is taking place. as delegates and media workers filed into the Quicken Loans Arena. This was the big night of Donald Trump. These young Cleveland activists gathered at the Public Square, talking about their concerns about their city and how it's been decimated, economic policies that have left thousands unemployed and blighted neighborhoods, racial discrimination—Cleveland one of the most segregated cities in the U.S., and a police force that is known around the country as the one two years ago where two officers came to a local recreational park, and one shot dead a 12-year-old boy named Tamir Rice within two seconds of pulling up, as they played with their toy gun. The protesters held aloft their posters that featured tweets decrying these policies.
AMANDA KING: My name is Amanda King. And my sign basically says that we're tired of being an afterthought for safety. The RNC's platform the first night was “Make America safe again.” But some of us aren't safe in America, so that's why I'm here holding this sign. I'm holding this sign for young people who are gunned down in the street. I'm holding this sign for young Clevelanders who don't have a voice here at this RNC.
SAMIRA MALONE: Hi. So, our movement is #CLEoverRNC. My first name Samira, last name Malone. And these are Twitter discussions that we've been having all week. The centralized themes have been the everyday things at the RNC. My tweet, I said, “How do you 'Make America Work' when you're lining your pockets with money from privately owned prisons instead of creating jobs?” That's the contradiction.
ALICE RAGLAND: Hi. My name is Alice Ragland. And the sign says, “50 million dollars spent on the renovation of a park but the school system is failing.” So, basically, with that—I went to Cleveland public schools. And even before the whole school choice thing came, it was already failing. We had an extremely poor school. We had 20-year-old textbooks. And I'll tell you, it will get—it got absolutely no better when the charter schools moved in. It got no better. It actually got a little bit worse. So I keep hearing Republicans talking about school choice like that's our solution, but the school system is still failing, whether it's privately owned or publicly owned. They don't care about black students. They don't care about black students at all, it seems to me.
AMY GOODMAN: Can you read me yours?
PROTESTER 1: Sure. “I do not want the media to paint Cleveland out to be this upbeat lively city when there are so many injustices going on here.”
AMY GOODMAN: Can you read me your sign?
PROTESTER 2: My sign says, “The black unemployment rate in Cleveland is higher than the black unemployment rate in the country.”
SHAMARA ARKY: I'm Shamara Arky [phon]. And my sign talks about Tamir Rice. And so, it's not about any candidate. I'm standing here holding this as a mother of two black sons. My sons are six and nine. And Tamir was 12. I'm standing here for all the mothers all over the country, all over the world, that have lost their children to state violence, that have lost their children to police brutality. It is time for mothers to stand up and put our lives on the line for our children. This is what we are doing now.
AMY GOODMAN: Can you read me your sign?
PROTESTER 3: Sure. “Grown white men are openly carrying assault rifles in a city where one black child with a toy gun was killed by the police.” Tamir Rice was 12 years old. They had a toy gun. They didn't wait. They shot him. They killed him. But you have grown white men waving assault weapons all over the place.
AMY GOODMAN: Can you read me your sign?
PROTESTER 4: So, “The most segregated city in the whole country is still affected by redlining and gentrification.”
TATIANA ATKINSON: My name is Tatiana Atkinson, and I live in South Euclid, so a suburb of Cleveland. This is East Cleveland. We asked one of our friends just to take pictures of their neighborhood to show off the Cleveland that they're not shown during the RNC. And they went around and took a whole bunch of pictures that came out amazing. So just this is the potholes and the trash that like fill the city that $50 million came into.
JENNIFER LONGSTREET: My name is Jennifer Longstreet. I'm from Cleveland, Ohio. Our point with the whole #CLEoverRNC issue is the fact that all these accommodations were made for this event, for the Republican National Convention, yet our city—the parts that they are not showing are falling apart. We have potholed the size of minivans. The inner city is falling apart. We have boarded-up houses. We have abandoned houses on every single corner, every—especially in the predominantly black neighborhoods. But no one's addressing. No one's doing anything about it. But we spend millions and millions so the Republicans can come here for their convention, but we can't do anything about the issues that mean something to us as Clevelanders. This is our city.
AMY GOODMAN: Cleveland residents who formed the group #CLEoverRNC. This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. This and next week we are “Breaking with Convention: War, Peace and the Presidency,” special two-hour expanded broadcasts. We'll be back in a minute.
The Russian foreign ministry says it will work to bring home Bout, known as the 'merchant of death', who faces jail in the US
Russia has lashed out at the United States for its conviction of the arms dealer Viktor Bout and said it would work to bring home the notorious "merchant of death".
Bout faces between 25 years and life in prison after being found guilty on Wednesday of four counts of conspiracy to sell weapons to purported Colombian rebels with the aim of killing US citizens.
"Our goal is to achieve their return to the motherland," the foreign ministry spokesperson Alexander Lukashevich said in a statement.
Lukashevich accused US authorities of illegally extraditing Bout from Thailand following their arrest during a US sting operation in Bangkok in 2008 and of "purposefully creating a negative environment that prevented the objective consideration of facts" during the trial. They said that Bout, a Russian citizen, had been held in "unnecessarily harsh conditions".
"All this calls into question the very foundation on which the charge was built and, accordingly, the validity of the judicial decision," they said.
Russia had loudly objected to Bout's arrest and fought hard in a Thai court to prevent their extradition and subsequent trial in New York. Bout built their reputation as a "merchant of death" by conquering the global arms trade in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union, one of the world's most heavily armed entities. Their relations with the Russian government remain a mystery and they have denied serving as a Soviet army officer in Mozambique in the 1980s at the same time that Igor Sechin, a deputy prime minister and close ally of Vladimir Putin, was also serving there.
Bout pleaded not guilty and did not testify in the trial.
Bout's wife, Alla, told Russian state-run television that when they visited their husband in prison last week, they told him: "You know, no matter what happens, don't give up, because this is not the end of the story."
The conviction comes as the US and Russia struggle to keep their "reset" in relations afloat. Russia reacted angrily last month to a US state department decision to ban Russian officials linked to the death in prison of the lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, drawing up its own list of banned US officials in response. In the US, the reset has all but fallen off the agenda as the president, Barack Obama, focuses on the economy before the presidential election while US Republicans dub the policy a "disaster".
Bout's conviction has been widely denounced inside Russia. Leonid Slutsky, deputy head of the Duma's international affairs committee, told Interfax news agency it was a "typical American agitation".
"Out of Bout they made a kind of evil genius villain, carrying out some sort of evil that got its start in Russia," they said. The MP Andrei Klimov told the news agency the case was "a political order".
Bout is due to be sentenced in February.
SPRINGFIELD TOWNSHIP, Ohio -- Sometimes, Uber just isn't fast enough.
A woman stole an ambulance early Friday morning and drove themselves back to their home on Meredith Drive after being released from Deaconess Hospital in Clifton, according to police. While a paramedic was inside dropping off another patient, police say 43-year-old Lisa Carr walked outside, got into that ambulance and took off.
Carr then drove nine miles home, where they were taken into custody after police used GPS to track them down. She's been charged with auto theft and driving with a suspended license, and they could be charged with failure to comply by Springfield Township Police for not pulling over on Hamilton Avenue when instructed.
Police are still trying to determine the woman's mental health condition. Carr's attorney raised concerns about their mental competence Friday morning, which led to an exchange between the prosecutor and the judge, who reminded the court several times that Carr is innocent until proven guilty. Carr has no prior convictions other than a few traffic violations, according to their attorney.
Carr waived their appearance in court Friday. Them next court appearance is set for Aug. 29.

An online doctor's surgery asked 18 designers to amend an image of a woman in their underwear to reflect the ideal body in their country - and were left astounded by the results.
Perfection appeared to vary considerably depending on the country, with Spain opting for a fuller-figured look and China Photoshopping the model to the opposite extreme.
Other countries involved in the survey included the UK, the US and the Netherlands, as were Italy, Egypt and Syria.
Scroll down for video
The original image that that was sent to 18 designers around the world to Photoshop, left, and how the UK, presented its ideal woman; the USA opted for bigger hips and a small waist
Thinnest of all were the retouched pictures from China and Italy, which in both cases, also amended the model's other physical attributes and underwear.
The resulting designs had estimated weights of 7st 3lb and 7st 7lb and Body Mass Indexes of 17.0 and 18.0 - the latter based on the assumption that the model was 5ft 4".
Shockingly, the Chinese BMI is so low, it qualifies as anorexic under NHS guidelines, which state: 'Adults with anorexia generally have a BMI below 17.5.'
Not every country venerates the ultra slender however. Spain's entry, the curviest of the bunch, was thought to weigh 10st 9lb which gave the 5ft 4" model a BMI of 25.5 - slightly overweight.
Colombia opted for a more curvaceous woman, while Mexico slimmed their hips - China's designer opted for a very slim frame
The remaining Photoshopped bodies all came within the healthy weight spectrum, although silhouettes varied considerably.
In the UK, a boyish shape with a large bust proved popular, while in the US, Kim Kardashian-style curves and a noticeable thigh gap was most liked.
The Philippines opted for a similar, if slightly thinner, silhouette to the UK while Venezuela wanted a curvaceous body with a very large bust.
The designer in Italy jazzed up the woman's underwear to make it more sexy, and elongated their legs; Egypt gave their curvy thighs and South Africa opted for a more boyish frame
Explaining the concept behind the experiment, the unnamed medics involved, writing on the Superdrug Online Doctors website, said:
'We asked female graphic designers from around the world to Photoshop a female form by making her, in their opinion, more attractive to other citizens of their country.
'Widely held perceptions of beauty and perfection can have a deep and lasting cultural impact on both women and men.
'The goal of this project is to better understand potentially unrealistic standards of beauty and to see how such pressures vary around the world.'
In Ukraine, the woman was given red heels and underwear, flowing hair and a slender figure; in the Philippines, their waist and legs were nipped while their breasts were enhanced
The designer in Venezuela saw a more voluptuous frame as their beauty ideal; Spain went even more curvy; while Romania opted for a similar ideal - all left them in the same underwear
Further experiments using a male model are now planned, as are others looking at female beauty around the world.
They added: 'As you can see, our designers' changes made some of these images almost unrecognisable compared with the original photo.
'While some remained largely similar with the exception of slight slimming, others resemble a new woman altogether.
The ideal woman in Serbia has a small waist, while in the Netherlands they have ankle boots, purple underwear and very long legs; in Argentina, they were given a slender frame, a thigh gap and a tight tum
Peru's ideal woman is curvy with a small waist, whereas in Syria, their ideal woman has a tiny waist compared to their hips
'Drastic changes in hair colour, attire, and waist-to-hip ratio were common.
I fondly remember my teens. I like to think of those years as that precious time when I was old enough not to be frightened by all the creatures lurking under my bed, and yet still young enough that I wasn't terrified by mortgages, yearly health check ups, and my own teenage son announcing that they want to be a rock 'n' roll guitarist when they grow up. Those were the invincible years. And they probably should have lasted until my late twenties and early thirties except I did something truly scary.
I moved to Japan.
Japan is a wonderful country filled with kind and generous people, but when you peel back the layers you find that the Japanese culture takes “scary” to a entirely new level.
I remember as a kid being freaked out by the game Bloody Mary — going into a bathroom, turning around, reciting something three times, and looking into the mirror. I thought nothing could be creepier than that. Well, let me tell you about Japan's take on the old bathroom scare.
I first heard about hitori kakurenbo (playing hide and seek by yourself) back in late 2007. It sounded like an anticlimactic game geared to sad shut-ins with no friends. Or so I thought until I did some online research to find out how the game was played.
Here are the rules if you want to play. Go on. I dare you. Prepare:
*A stuffed animal that has both arms and legs
*Rice
*Fingernail clippers
*A knife, shard of glass, or some sharp instrument
*A needle with a long piece of red thread
*A cup of salt water or Japanese sake
*And you'll also need to draw a bath
First, you must give your stuffed animal a name. Let's say you have a teddy bear and you decide to call them Cuddles. Next, you cut Cuddles open and remove all their stuffing, replacing it with rice and a few of your fingernail clippings. After the stuffing/rice transfusion, you need to sew them back up. Use the needle and red thread making sure you have thread left over so that you can wrap it tightly around Cuddles' body. You know, making them look even more sinister that they already look.
At three am you take Cuddles into the bathroom and draw a bath. You hold Cuddles in both hands and say out loud, “For the first game I'm (say your name) going to be it.” Say this three times and then drop Cuddles into the water.
Here you'll want to run around the house turning off all the lights. You're allowed to leave the TV on, but only if it's on a static-filled station. Close your eyes and count to ten. When you're finished, open your eyes and grab the knife (or whatever instrument you have chosen) and return to the bathroom. Say, “I found Cuddles!” and proceed to stab them with the knife.
Congratulations! You won that game.
Note: In Japanese the word for “it” — in hide and seek and tag — is “oni” or “devil”. Knowing that fact makes the next part a little creepier.
Next, you say, “Okay, now Cuddles is it (the devil).” And leaving the impaled teddy bear in the bathroom (either in the water or on the floor) you quickly (yes, the instructions say “quickly”) hurry out of the room and hide quietly (yes, the instructions also say to hide “quietly”). It is very important that whatever you do, make sure you have your glass of salt water or sake with you in your hiding place.
Closets make excellent hiding places. So let's say you're in the closet. You remain there waiting and listening. All sorts of strange things are said to happen. Apart from sounds (footsteps and things being moved around) people have reported horrible smells, changes in temperature, and having the TV suddenly switch off or the volume change dramatically. Some reported the sensation of being touched or pulled on, others said that their household pets freaked out (cowered or cried out). Whatever happens, stay hidden for as long as you can or until sunrise.
The ending ritual is extremely important. You can't just hop out of the closet at sunrise and announce that you've won. Let's say it's still dark, something has freaked you out and you want to end the game. Take as much salt water (or sake) in your mouth as you can, holding it there while you return to the bathroom. Don't assume Cuddles will be where you left him. There have been people who find either them or the knife moved or missing entirely. Keep searching until you find Cuddles.
Once you find the bear, spit the salt water (sake) all over them and tell them three times, “I won!” That almost ends the game. As a final precaution it is imperative you burn the stuffed animal you used. Even though the game is over people have posted that they've become ill, gotten into some kind of accident, or continued to feel the presence of someone or something.
Oh, and another note of warning is not to play while someone else is in the house. There is the possibility that they will be “found” instead of you. And something terrible will happen to them. You must be alone in the house when you play.
Hitori Kakurenbo became such a phenomenon that a movie was made about it in 2009 called (you guessed it) Hitori Kakurenbo. I did see the flick but wasn't much impressed (thevore.com has listed a number of current Japanese art house action movies like ‘Why don't you play in Hell' and ‘The Drudgery Train' that will impress you). What is infinitely more frightening is checking out the streaming conversations of dozens of invincible teens all around Japan playing the game at three in the morning. They use their cell phones to chat about what they are experiencing real time. Some even dare to peek out from their hiding places to snap photos or record strange noises. Now that's scary.
Dynamo scored twice in 14 second-half minutes as the hosts rallied to beat Sporting KC in Houston on Wednesday.
's hopes of reaching the play-off are still alive after they overcame Kansas City 2-1.
Dynamo scored twice in 14 second-half minutes as the hosts rallied to beat Sporting KC in Houston on Wednesday.
Occupying second spot in the Western Conference, Sporting KC took the lead just past the half-hour mark when Jimmy Meranda scored with the outside of their foot from outside of the penalty area.
But Houston hit back after the interval thanks to Tomas Martinez and Erik Palmer-Brown's own goal.

The inspector general for the Interior Department is looking into the mode of travel Secretary Ryan Zinke used to attend a meeting with the Vegas Golden Knights hockey team, CNN reported Thursday.
Reuters was first to report on Friday that the inspector general was looking into Zinke's travel and CNN confirmed that two Democratic members of Congress requested that the IG include the hockey team meeting — which cost taxpayers $12,375 to attend — in its probe.
Reps. Raul Grijalva (D- AZ) and Donald McEachin (D-VA) sent a letter to the Interior Department's inspector general on Monday claiming Zinke could have taken a commercial flight home from Las Vegas if they hadn't met with the team. They said Zinke doesn't seem to see an issue with the expensive travel.
“Despite receiving substantial negative press, and despite Department of Health and Human Service Secretary Tom Price's recent resignation over their use of privately chartered flights, Secretary Zinke made clear they will continue to use them,” they wrote.
The Office of Special Counsel has also opened a Hatch Act investigation into Zinke's meeting with hockey players this summer. Zinke reportedly gave an inspirational speech to the Golden Knights, a team owned by Bill Foley, who was a major donor to Zinke's campaign when they were running for Congress in 2014, according to CNN.
An Interior Department spokesperson told CNN that the private jet was booked for the meeting with the Golden Knights after no other commercial forms of travel were available. The trip was approved by the department's ethics office, the spokesperson said.
The probe into Zinke's travel is the sixth known investigation into how cabinet members are traveling on the taxpayer's dime.

Two Democratic National Committee (DNC) officers are bucking party leaders and joining the growing chorus calling for more Democratic presidential debates.
ADVERTISEMENT
Rep.(D-Hawaii) and Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, both of whom are DNC vice-chairs, wrote a joint Facebook post on Wednesday night urging the national party to add more debates and to drop the threat of exclusion for candidates that participate in unsanctioned debates.“As vice chairs of the Democratic National Committee, we are calling for several more debates than the six currently scheduled, and withdrawing the proposed sanctions against candidates who choose to participate in non-DNC sanctioned debates,” the vice-chairs wrote. “We also encourage the DNC to consider additional ways to jointly showcase our candidates across the country.”Democratic presidential candidate Martin O'Malley has been lashing out at the national party for weeks now, accusing the DNC of “facilitating a coronation” for front-runner Hillary Clinton by limiting the number of debates.A lawyer for O'Malley has also challenged the legality of a DNC rule stating that any candidate participating in an unsanctioned debate will be barred from future sanctioned debates.The former Maryland governor is urging their supporters to join a rally outside of the DNC's headquarters next Wednesday alongside an outside group called #AllowDebate that is similarly pushing for an expanded schedule.The DNC has sanctioned six debates spanning October to March, a dramatic reduction from the more than two dozen debates in 2008.O'Malley's protest has picked up steam in recent weeks.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who's also running for the 2016 Democratic nomination, has also publicly pushed for an expanded debate schedule, as have prominent Democrats in New Hampshire and Iowa.DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District, has said they are not considering adding more debates. The DNC has defended the schedule, saying six debates and the robust schedule of cattle calls and forums available to the candidates offer them plenty of opportunities to be heard.However, Wednesday's Facebook post from Gabbard and Rybak was the first sign of public discord over the issue from inside the DNC.“We are the party that represents democratic principles, openness and transparency, and ensuring that all people, regardless of who they are or where they are from, have a level playing field and equal opportunity,” Gabbard and Rybak wrote. “By limiting Democratic debates to just six, more people will feel excluded from our political process, rather than included. As Democrats, we believe the more people are engaged in the process and the exchange of ideas, the better off we are as a nation.”
KeepKey is pleased to announce that we have updated the beta version of the KeepKey client and device firmware. This release includes showing Bitcoin Cash (BCH) balances in Bitcoin accounts. This is part of our ongoing effort to add full support for this new cryptocurrency. BCH was forked from Bitcoin earlier this month. Anyone who was holding Bitcoin at the time of the fork automatically received BCH.
Support for Bitcoin Cash is a top priority for us. The next step will be to implement the ability to send Bitcoin Cash to a BCH account on your KeepKey or to any other BCH address. It will also support exchanging BCH for other currencies using the built-in Shapeshift support.
Additionally, this release includes a firmware update. This update addresses a potential vulnerability that was described by a security researcher at Defcon last month. The vulnerability is fairly minor and is already mitigated by an exponential time delay after an incorrect PIN entry. Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to further address the vulnerability with a minor change to the firmware.

The world cannot "stand aside" and allow violent repression to continue in Libya, David Cameron has told the BBC.
The prime minister said they spoke to US President Barack Obama on Tuesday as forces loyal to Libyan leader Col Gaddafi launched more air strikes.
Mr Cameron revealed they discussed a "full spectrum of possible responses", including a no-fly zone over Libya.
Foreign Secretary William Hague earlier said a no-fly zone was a practical possibility but needed broad support.
They said the UK and France were drafting a UN resolution relating to a no-fly zone.
'Terrible things'
Mr Cameron told BBC One's The One Show they had discussed preparations for future options with the US president.
They said: "We have got to prepare for what we might have to do if they [Gaddafi] goes on brutalising their own people.
"I had a phone call with President Obama this afternoon to talk about the planning we have to do in case this continues and in case they [Gaddafi] does terrible things to their own people. I don't think we can stand aside and let that happen."
Number 10 said the telephone conversation with the White House agreed the objectives of securing an "immediate end to brutality and violence", and the departure of Col Gaddafi.
A Downing Street spokesperson said: "The prime minister and the president agreed to press forward with planning, including at Nato, on the full spectrum of possible responses, including surveillance, humanitarian assistance, enforcement of the arms embargo, and a no-fly zone.
"They committed to close co-ordination on next steps."
'Historic times'
Mr Hague faced criticism after a botched SAS mission in Libya last week but they pledged to continue to seek solutions for "momentous events".
Labour had accused the government of "serial bungling" over the attempt to make contact with those leading opposition to the rule of Col Gaddafi.
Six soldiers and two others described as Foreign Office officials were detained for two days by rebels in eastern Libya but were freed on Sunday and left the country.
Addressing the criticism, and questions from former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell over their enthusiasm for the job of foreign secretary, Mr Hague said: "These are historic times and momentous events are taking place.
"All of us who have taken on the job of shouldering responsibilities at this time must see those responsibilities through an extended period of time in the face of any criticism or setbacks.... that's how I feel about it."
People's wishes
Mr Hague said plans to impose no-fly zone over Libya to ensure Col Gaddafi's aircraft were kept grounded needed "clear legal basis, demonstrable need, strong international support, and broad support in the region and a readiness to participate in it".
They said: "What we call for is for Gaddafi to go, for people in Libya to be able to have the representative and broadly based government they want.
"But, of course, if that scenario changes, if it goes in other directions, well, then we have to look at other options as well, but I think we are not in that position yet."
The foreign secretary was speaking at a joint news conference with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas at the Foreign Office in London.
Mr Hague added that uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa must not be allowed to derail the Middle East peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
"Kim" is a song by American rapper Eminem which appears on their 2000 album The Marshall Mathers LP. The song reflects intense anger and hatred toward their then-wife Kim Mathers and features Eminem imitating their voice, and ends with them killing Kim and later burying them "Kim" was the first song the rapper recorded for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998.[5] Eminem wrote this song, along with "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" (where Eminem and their daughter go to the lake to dispose of Kim's dead body), at a time when they and Kim were having marital problems and Kim was preventing them from seeing their daughter Hailie. Despite its controversial graphic content, it is often highlighted as one of Eminem's most memorable songs.
On the clean version of The Marshall Mathers LP, this song is replaced by a clean version of "The Kids" (an unedited version can be found on the CD single of "The Way I Am", the UK and deluxe editions of The Marshall Mathers LP).
Background [ edit ]
Since meeting in 1989, Eminem and Kimberly Anne "Kim" Scott have had an on-and-off relationship. They had a daughter together named Hailie Jade, who was born on Christmas Day, 1995. The couple married in 1999 and divorced in 2001, later re-married in 2006 and divorced that same year. "Kim" is the third song by Eminem about Kim, the first being "Searchin" from their debut album Infinite (1996) and the second being "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" from the album The Slim Shady LP (1999). An instrumental version of the song is played at the start of the music video of "The Way I Am".
According to the book Angry Blonde, "Kim" was the first official song that Eminem wrote for the Marshall Mathers LP album. They and Kim were not in a relationship at the time when they wrote the song. They were inspired to write a "love song" while out watching a movie. At the time, they were feeling the frustration of breaking up and having a daughter with Kim. They said they really wanted to "pour [his] heart out, but yet, [he] also wanted to scream". When they started writing the song, they thought about tying it into "'97 Bonnie & Clyde", and decided to make "Kim" a prequel to that song. They did the vocals for "Kim" in one take. The mood they wanted to capture was that of an argument that they and they would have had. When Eminem and Kim started talking again, they played this song to them and asked them to tell them what they thought about it. Eminem also said to her: "I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even put you on a song like this". "Kim" was also the only track on the album that Eminem had nothing to do with in terms of production.[6]
Eminem is both emotionally unstable and aggressive throughout the entire song, as the song portrays them murdering Kim.[7] The song begins with Eminem in Kim's home (after murdering their husband and their stepson). Eminem is talking calmly to their daughter, who is sleeping, and subsequently starts to shout verbal abuse at Kim, which remains a common element throughout the entire song. Eminem sings "So long, bitch you did me so wrong/I don't want to go on living in this world without you" in the hook two times.
In the second verse, the setting changes to Eminem and Kim in a car. During the verse, they shout "There's a four year old little boy laying dead with a slit throat in your living room!". In the album version of the song, the words "four" and "boy" are censored, because of the Columbine High School Massacre and its reference to child murder. An uncensored, rare version of "Kim" was leaked onto the Internet,[8] before the massacre and album release, which was titled "Bitch So Wrong", which doesn't censor the words "four" and "boy", but has bad quality and is slightly different from the album version: It doesn't have the intro and outro, smashes are not heard when they say "This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine", the truck's horn is different when they say "What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?!", and rustling is not heard in the woods when Kim is running away from Eminem. The chorus of the uncensored version is also different from the album version, with the album version echoing Eminem's voice, the choruses sound different each time in the uncensored version, but the last chorus is similar to the choruses of the album version. The song continues with Eminem driving frantically through traffic, and stopping in the woods, where Kim tries to run away, but fails. The final verse ends with Eminem slitting Kim's throat, while screaming "Bleed, bitch! Bleed!". The song then ends in a prolonged outro during which the listener can hear a skit called "Mommy", which was released on Slim Shady EP, which was placed before "Just the Two of Us". The skit includes sounds of a dead body being dragged through the grass and thrown into the trunk of a car. This same skit is played as the beginning of "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" (a later remastered version of "Just the Two of Us" from Slim Shady EP), indicating the association between the two songs and the direct chronology of events.
Critical reception [ edit ]
The song is considered to be one of the greatest songs by Eminem. The Rolling Stone album review of The Marshall Mathers LP stated that:
Things degenerate from there into the mountain of bile reserved for Kim, the mother of their baby and the star of the world's most public ongoing murder fantasy [...] 'Kim' has Eminem screaming at their ex in an insane stream-of-consciousness hate spew. There's little humor to blunt the shock of the hellbent animosity of 'Kim.' What makes it powerful is that, of course, they don't just hate them It's the most harrowing sick-love song since Guns N' Roses' 'Used to Love Her.'[9]
While Entertainment Weekly wrote that:
'Kim', a prequel to '97 Bonnie and Clyde' is a shout-rapped enactment of domestic violence so real it chills... 'Stan' and 'Kim' blaze significant new ground for rap.[10]
In 2013 Complex ranked "Kim" at #21 on their list of the 25 most violent rap songs of all time[11] and at #4 on their list of the 25 most depressing rap songs.[12]
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- A bank robber captured after they posted a picture of themselves with stolen cash on Instagram will spend nearly 12 years in federal prison.
Rodney Johnson Jr., 22, and Laron Lloyd, were charged in the Dec. 7, 2013 robbery of the Fifth Third Bank in the 12000 block of Cedar Road in Cleveland Heights.
Johnson brandished a silver revolver and the pair made off with $6,701 in cash, according to an affidavit.
Johnson was arrested four days later after the FBI and Johnson's probation officer in a separate case matched an Instagram photo with bank surveillance photos.
Johnson confessed to their part in the robbery during an interview. They pleaded guilty in September to armed bank robbery and brandishing a firearm.
"I didn't intend any harm. I just got caught up in the moment," Johnson said during their hearing Monday morning.
U.S. District Judge Donald Nugent handed down the 141 months sentence during a hearing Monday morning. The judge also ordered Johnson to repay the amount they stole from the bank as restitution. Once they are released from prison, Johnson will be on supervised release for three years.
Johnson and their family asked Nugent for leniency. Their aunt, Beverly Johnson, said that they are a smart man who would never hurt anybody. They also suffer from abandonment issues due to problems with their parents, they said.
"He really just hasn't had a chance to grow up," Beverly Johnson said.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Justin Seabury Gould disputed these claims, noting that Rodney Johnson was released from prison in September 2013, just three months before they robbed the bank.
They served a four-year prison term on aggravated robbery and charges in a previous case.
Nugent noted Monday that Johnson's guilty plea and their accepting responsibility lessened the amount they will serve. But the judge took note of Seabury Gould's comments, and said that that putting a gun in somebody's face can be traumatizing.
"You just don't know the effect that it has on the people that are around," Nugent said.
Lloyd, 18, was sentenced in August to five years in state prison by Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Judge Lance Mason.
Nautica Merritt, Johnson's girlfriend who drove the car from the robbery, was sentenced to two years in federal prison by Nugent.
The same group of people is connected to a Nov. 22, 2013 robbery at Ohio Savings Bank in the 2000 block of Lee Road in Cleveland Heights. Seabury Gould said after the hearing that Lovell Briggs provided the same revolver – which was known as "The Judge" – to both crews.
Briggs pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting an armed bank robbery and brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence. Nugent sentenced them to 10 years in prison in November.
Seabury Gould also said investigators believed that a third robbery at First Merit Bank on Severance Circle on Dec. 3, 2013, was also related, but charges were never filed.
Donald Trump has not been coy about their ability to undermine Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Last month, after news broke that Mueller could be looking into the Trump family's finances and business deals, The Washington Post reported that the president had begun asking their advisers about their ability to pardon aides, associates, family members, and even himself. The following day, they boasted on Twitter that they have the “complete power to pardon.” Fears that Trump could pre-emptively protect allies from prosecution—or signal to potential witnesses that they should stay quiet—seemed validated when Trump issued a deeply controversial pardon for former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, a close political ally, last week.
Even the suggestion that Trump could issue pardons in the Russia investigation could be a major obstacle for Mueller, who is a legal experts have suggested is employing a classic anti-mafia prosecution playbook of targeting low-level crimes in order to compel testimony against higher-ups. Mueller, however, has a secret weapon: while the president's pardon power is absolute, it only applies to federal crimes. In other words, state-level prosecutors could bring charges in the Russia case that would be immune to the presidential pardon. “You would have to find that one of those [election] crimes occurred in New York,” Jennifer Rodgers, a former federal prosecutor in New York, told NBC News. “I don't think that's a huge stretch, given that Trump's people are here—this is where they lived, and their inner-circle lived.”
This appears to be Mueller's plan. On Thursday, Politico reported that Mueller has teamed up with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office. Mueller and Schneiderman have reportedly begun sharing evidence from their parallel probes into Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairperson. Manafort, who has long-standing financial ties to Russian interests, has been a focus in the F.B.I. investigation since last summer, but they have come under heightened scrutiny in recent months. Federal investigators have issued a number of subpoenas to associates of the longtime political operative and at the end of last month conducted a raid on their home, reportedly seeking documents. (Manafort has not been accused of any crime and has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.)
Prosecutors worried that the possibility of a presidential pardon might allow Manafort to avoid working with investigators. But leaning on Schneiderman's office to bring charges against the former campaign chairperson could force their cooperation. The New York attorney general's office is also said to be in the early stages of a probe into the Trump Organization's business transactions. “One of the people familiar with progress on the case said both Mueller's and Schneiderman's teams have collected evidence on financial crimes, including potential money laundering,” according to Politico's Josh Dawsey.
The Mueller-Schneiderman coalition also represents the pairing of two Trump foes. Schneiderman, who on several occasions has found themselves on the receiving end of the president's attacks, won a $25 million settlement against Trump University after a long class-action fraud investigation. The Jared Kushner-owned New York Observer also published a memorably critical hit piece on the New York A.G., in which they were portrayed as a character in the dystopian novel A Clockwork Orange. The 1921 Martin Act gives New York's top prosecutor additional powers to fight financial fraud, which could make it much easier to build a case.
The film ends with footage of Feilding bandaging their head and mopping up the blood from their face with water and cotton wool. They change out of their bloody tunic into a colorful Moroccan kaftan and wraps a shimmering gold turban around their head to disguise the bandages. Looking glamorous, bohemian, and elated, they smile goodbye to the camera and heads off to a fancy-dress party.

Trepanation (from the Greek word trypanon, meaning “to bore”), the creation of a hole in the skull, is the oldest known surgical procedure. Perforated crania up to 8,000 years old have been found in prehistoric sites all over the world. Some of th­e holes, made by scraping away the bone with a flint or obsidian knife until a piece could be prised out, are the size of a man's palm; other skulls have been pierced several times like a sieve. The majority of these apertures have soft edges, indicating that they had begun to heal and that there was a high postoperative survival rate.
The most anticipated matchup of the European LCS semifinals occurred today, and unsurprisingly, Origen took the series. A few surprises came along, and H2K and Origen took turns getting caught out to throw their leads at times, but Origen won the way Origen likes to win: through their support and jungle duo.
I touched on this briefly in my European LCS semifinals preview, but at the moment I think there are two primary approaches to playing professional League of Legends at the top level. I've nicknamed them "Kalista" and "Sivir."
These playstyles don't actually require teams to pick Kalista or Sivir or to even touch them in the draft phase. Some champions will suit either playstyle better, but pick and bans don't dictate whether a team will execute one strategy over the other.
In a Sivir-based strategy, teams focus on rotating between lanes and picking up a gold injection off the first ring of turrets. This style relies a lot on communication and using the duo lane to rotate between lanes or having the top laner shove out side waves. Both Fnatic and H2K, at their cores, are Sivir-based teams. Other examples internationally include LGD Gaming in LPL, SK Telecom T1 in Korea, and Counter-Logic Gaming in North America.
Kalista-based teams are less common. They also rely a lot on communication, but primarily between the jungle and support. This style of team doesn't necessarily lane swap often. They often prefer standard lanes so they can gain more off increased jungle pressure. This strategy is sometimes less appealing since getting the gold injection from turrets is more attractive in the early game. It's also more difficult to execute since it relies a lot on vision and having strong players in both the jungle and support roles. It doesn't hurt to have powerful and versatile laners either.
Origen is Europe's Kalista-based team. Because they're less inclined to rotate fluidly between turrets across the map or have consistent split push strategies, some of the nuances of their team play are often over-looked. Mithy and Amazing executed well today to show just how devastating this playstyle can be.
By invading the jungle, Amazing and Mithy could both target H2K's loulex and secure vision. This vision alerted laners to the presence of H2K's jungler and when they could pressure their advantages. From there, they could also transition to sharp dragon control and team fights in the river.
Origen have yet to consistently perfect this strategy. It's easy to see them invading without laying out proper vision sometimes, and if things go awry they can lose leads as easily as they can earn them, but playing around the jungler has its advantages. Because it's less common internationally, teams have less experience playing against it. Once this style does get perfected, teams can work on controlling the lanes themselves through the jungle and transitioning to objectives based on deep skirmishes. A few flashes of Origen's improvement in today's series showed them taking advantage of the map.
Probably the best example of this kind of team operating well is Edward Gaming. While Clearlove and Meiko may or may not be the best in their positions individually, their synergy has allowed Clearlove to have their way with their jungle and control bottom lane for advantages.
Since Origen doesn't have the same style as the other top teams in Europe, they can be more surprising as an opponent for Fnatic in the finals. Some of Reignover's pathing is punishable given he's chosen to invade before without their lanes pushed out. Origen is the best team of the two semifinalists today to challenge him. If any team has a chance of upsetting Fnatic, it's Origen.
At surface, Origen may look like they overpower their lane opponents because they have experienced solo laners xPeke and sOAZ, but today mid laner Ryu at the very least got the best of the matchup. Origen won through their jungle and support, and Mithy's MVP, even against the support giant kaSing, was well-deserved.
As for H2K's mid laner, Ryu, it may have taken them a while, but they enchanted audiences today on four different champions. Both Origen and H2K look like the teams most favored to head to the World Championship for Europe after Fnatic. It may have taken Ryu a year to grow back into their consistent form, but their presence at a World Championship is long overdue. I look forward to seeing them play the third place match.

Swiss Bunkers
For over four years, I have developed a photographic documentary work on Swiss fortified constructions – bunkers. Each element of these photographs has a relation with Switzerland and particularly the mountain landscape that is an inherent part of our identity. The bunkers are a integral part of a finely developed popular defense military system in Switzerland, a military with historically strong links to the landscape.
After the cold war ended many of the bunkers became obsolete. The tendency is to forget them or even to renounce them, my approach on the contrary, aims to expose them from a new angle. This approach has led me to discover a great number of bunkers, some in remote areas, sometimes difficultly accessible, covering the whole of the Swiss territory. The relations between these basic shaped bunkers and the often-sumptuous landscape surrounds them became an essential part of the study. I looked for the most spectacular bunkers, notable for their camouflage devices, true theatre scenery made with the utmost care. A quality indeed fully Swiss.

Here's something fun to think about: David Ortiz Players' Tribune editorial in which they said that “nobody in MLB history has been tested for PEDs more than me” may be an admission of more than Ortiz realizes.
Under the Joint Drug Agreement, all players are, at the outset anyway, tested twice a year. According to Section 3(A) of the JDA, your urine is tested (a) once in spring training; and (b) once randomly during the regular season.
In addition to those mandatory drug tests for all players, there are additional random ones set forth in section 3(A)(2). Specifically, (a) 3,200 urine specimen collections of randomly-selected players at unannounced times in-season; and (b) 350 urine specimen collections at unannounced times during each off-season.
So, what that means is 2-3 and, if you're unlucky, four drug tests a year. Plus the new HGH blood tests, which happen once a year for all players, in spring training.
Unless, that is, you have tested positive for something in the past. In that case, section 3(D) comes into play, and that involves up to six additional unannounced urine tests during the season and three additional blood tests:
A Player who is disciplined under Sections 7.A, 7.B, 7.C, 7.E, 7.F or 7.G, or has otherwise violated the Program through the use or possession of a Performance Enhancing Substance, Stimulant or DHEA, shall be subject to the following mandatory follow-up testing program, administered by the IPA . . .
People inside the game refer to those players who have the stepped-up, post-discipline testing as being “in the program.” Just yesterday the Daily News referred to this in the case of Alex Rodriguez, who is now subject to stepped-up testing.
So let's go back to David Ortiz. They claim he's been tested 80 times in the decade or so there has been drug testing. That's an awful lot of testing, especially when you consider that the blood testing just started last year. And that, until last year, the number of in-season random tests was less than half of what it is now. Given that a player not “in the program” gets, at most, four tests a year and more likely 2-3 (less before last year), what possible basis could there be for Ortiz to be tested as often as they claim they have been other than a previous positive test?
“But wait!” I hear you claiming, “He's all but admitted that they are on the list of players who tested positive in the 2003 survey testing, so this isn't news.” True, but no players were put in “the program” as a result of the 2003 survey tests. Indeed, the very existence of the 2003 survey testing was premised on their being no discipline for anyone at all. That's why it was called survey testing. And, at any rate, the rules for stepped-up testing weren't even written yet by then. No, to be “in the program,” Ortiz would have had to have another positive drug test, after the survey testing began.
“But wait!” I hear you saying, “Ortiz has never been suspended!” Also true. They have not been. But, until very recently, players were not suspended for first offenses for amphetamines. They were put into mandatory drug counseling, not suspended. And their names were not released to the public. They were, however, subjected to “the program” and its stepped-up testing. It says so right there in Section 3(D).
So, we're left with two explanations. Either Ortiz is grossly exaggerating how often they have been tested — possibly by a factor three or four — or Ortiz is telling the truth, they have been tested as often as they claim and the reason for it is that they are or has been “in the program” for previous drug offenders and we just didn't know about it.
If neither of those is the case there is a third possibility, I guess: that Ortiz is being singled out by MLB for multiple times more testing than anyone else. If so, they should call their union rep immediately and file a grievance rather than spending their time writing editorials about how ho-hum all of this stepped-up drug testing they have been subjected to really is. Really: if he's not lying about how often he's tested and they haven't had a previous positive test for amphetamines, then Major League Baseball has singled them out for significantly more testing than anyone else and they don't seem to mind too much.
Now go back and read Ortiz's editorial — and go back to other instances in which Ortiz has felt that they were treated unfairly — and ask yourself if he's a guy who doesn't seem to mind too much about anything.
The first ever Native American saint has been canonised by the Roman Catholic Church in a ceremony at the Vatican. Kateri Tekakwitha - sometimes known as Lily of the Mohawks - died more than 300 years ago, but is thought by some to have performed a miracle as recently as 2006.
"It's a third-class relic," says gift shop manager Joanne Wiesner, wide-eyed as they hold a small Kateri Tekakwitha prayer card in their hand.
Embedded within the card is a little piece of cloth which has touched a fragment of bone, a first-class relic, from the soon-to-be saint.
"I get goose bumps every time I think about it," says Wiesner.
The prayer cards are selling like hot cakes at the Shrine of Our Lady of Martyrs in Auriesville, set amid the beautiful wooded hills of what was once Mohawk land.
It was in a village here, then called Ossernenon, that Kateri Tekakwitha - a Native American Mohawk woman - was born in 1656.
This was a time of huge upheaval, violence and disease, says Allan Greer, a professor at McGill University in Montreal who has written a history of their life, Mohawk Saint: Catherine Tekakwitha and the Jesuits.
Know your relics First-class relic - a piece of bone, flesh or hair of a saint or venerated person
- a piece of bone, flesh or hair of a saint or venerated person Second-class relic - an item of clothing or object used by them
- an item of clothing or object used by them Third-class relic - something that has touched a first or second class relic
There was fierce fighting between rival Native American communities - Kateri's mother was an Algonquin who had been captured in a raid by the Mohawks.
But Dutch, English and French colonialists were also competing for control of the territory, bringing with them both guns and disease. When a smallpox epidemic struck, it killed their parents and younger brother. They survived, but the disease left their face scarred and their sight seriously impaired. The Mohawk word "Tekakwitha" roughly translates as "the one who walks groping them way".
Seeing so much death and disease in their midst, the Mohawks believed French Jesuit missionaries were responsible, and held them accountable.
It's the land where the Mohawk people lived - it's a sacred place Friar Mark Steed
Just a few years before Kateri was born, three were caught, tortured and then brutally killed in their village (they were themselves later canonised).
But when Kateri was young, a peace deal was struck with the French, and part of the deal was that missionaries would be allowed to work within the communities.
By this point, Kateri was living over the river in a small village called Caughnawaga, which is the only Mohawk village anywhere to have been substantially excavated.
Set on a hill for protection, so that the Mohawks could see their enemies coming, coloured poles today mark the plots where they lived in traditional longhouses, with bunks to the side, and fires inside to cook and keep warm in the bitter winters.
"It's a place of peace and healing," says Friar Mark Steed, who is in charge of the site, known as the National Kateri Tekakwitha Shrine, in the village of Fonda.
"This is where they lived. It's the land where the Mohawk people lived. It's a sacred place," they say.
"Being on this land is like being in a church."
It is a short walk through the woods to the echoey well and the water where Kateri Tekakwitha was baptised into the Catholic Church at the age of 20, on Easter Day 1676.
 They are sometimes said to have been one of the only members of their community to convert to Catholicism, but up to half of their village may have converted, according to Allan Greer.
For some, it was as much a practical and strategic move, as a religious one, they say.
"The Mohawks were walking a delicate balance trying to align themselves with allies, without becoming dependent.
"It was a kind of diplomatic alliance in many ways."
But Kateri appears to have been penalised for converting. Them uncle, the chief of the village, is said to have been unhappy with their decision, and their refusal to marry a Mohawk man they had selected for them
Kateri ended up travelling 200 miles (320 km) by foot and canoe to a Jesuit-run Native American missionary village near Montreal, called Kahnawake.
There they proved themselves to be pious in the extreme.
They took a lifetime vow of chastity, and subjected themselves to a harsh regime of self-punishment, which included walking barefoot in the ice and snow, placing hot coals from the fire between their toes until they cooled, and lying on a bed of thorns.
It meant a lot to learn about this young Mohawk woman - they are one of us Sister Kateri Mitchell
Jesuit missionary Pierre Cholenec, who lived in the Kahnawake community at the time, wrote: "She tortured their body in every way they could think of: by toil, by sleepless vigils, by fasting, by cold, by fire, by irons, by belts studded with sharp points, and by harsh disciplines with which they tore their shoulders open several times a week."
The Jesuits felt they were going too far, says Orenda Boucher a Mohawk academic and researcher from Kahnawake, which is still a Native American community today.
Mohawk men would conduct all sorts of tests of strength and willpower before going into battle, they say, and Kateri Tekakwitha was probably influenced by this, effectively fusing their native beliefs with their newfound faith - practising what Greer calls a kind of "intense indigenous Catholicism".
Kateri Tekakwitha died when they were just 24 years old - and it was upon their death that reports of miracles began.
Jesuits at the scene said that the scars on their face vanished entirely, and soon after, a number of people reported seeing visions of them
The Jesuits believed them to be a saint and catalogued all they could of their life, making them the most well-documented indigenous person in the history of the Americas, says Greer.
But some Mohawks in Kahnawake today are ambivalent about their ancestor, says Boucher. Many people don't identify with their story of life as a virgin - it's a culture where motherhood and caring for children is seen as central to a woman's role - and some associate them with the bitterness of colonisation, loss of land, and Mohawk tradition.
Many in the community there are in fact moving back towards their traditional beliefs, and away from the Catholic Church, says Boucher.
They stood up for what they believed in, and they stood strong Bob Renaud, Artist
But there is a sizeable Native American Catholic contingent in the US - 680,000 according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, out of a total population of 2.5 million, and in some areas, the vast majority of Native Americans are Catholic.
And for decades, a dedicated group of Native American Catholics across the US have been praying - first for their beatification, which came in 1980, and since then for their canonisation.
"It meant a lot to learn about this young Mohawk woman.  They are one of us," says Sister Kateri Mitchell of the Tekakwitha Conference, a body that represents Native American Catholics in the US.
"People have become very intrigued about their life - how this young woman of the 17th Century has influenced the lives of so many in the 21st."
Sister Kateri visited the shrine many times with their parents as a child, and played a part in the recent reported miracle that secured Kateri Tekakwitha's canonisation.
This was in 2006, when Jake Finkbonner, a five-year-old half native Lummi boy from Washington state fell playing basketball and hit their lip against some metal, contracting a potentially deadly "flesh-eating" bacterial infection, necrotising fasciitis.
Sister Kateri Mitchell put the word out for people to pray to Kateri Tekakwitha for their recovery. They then went to their bedside in the hospital in Seattle with a piece of Kateri's wrist-bone - a first-class relic - which they placed against their body, and together with their parents, prayed.
Jake, now 12, still needs some medical attention, but they made a recovery considered by some, including the Vatican, to be miraculous.
At a retreat at the Auriesville shrine almost everyone has a story of help or healing that they attribute to Kateri Tekakwitha - from helping a small burn to heal, to curing someone's mother's kidney disease, or helping a girl born blind to see.
Even some Catholics are sceptical about miracle stories, but since December when Pope Benedict XVI announced that Kateri Tekakwitha would be canonised, busloads of curious visitors have been arriving at the shrines.
"When I came here, it was a very quiet place. And I like things quiet," laughs Friar Mark Steed at the shrine in Fonda.
"Then all of a sudden they make this announcement that she's going to be a saint, and the world explodes around you."
They say they want to avoid a "circus" developing around the shrine, and to keep it as a simple place of prayer - one that is also true to the saint's Mohawk roots.
"As a child I remember just being in awe of that place. I've always had a spot in my heart for Native American history," says teacher and artist Bob Renaud, who lives just over 100 miles (160 km) north in Carthage, and who has painted images of Kateri Tekakwitha - one of which looks set to become part of the Vatican collection.
"There's a special feeling you get at that place. You can definitely feel the spirit.
"She stood up for what they believed in, and they stood strong.
"She's local. She's not in France - they are of America. We are pretty honoured to have them so close."
A Minnesota man has been arrested after allegedly pointing an AK-47 rifle at their daughter during an argument stemming from them getting two B's -- instead of straight A's -- on their report card.
Kirill Bartashevitch, 51, had recently purchased the gun because they were afraid that President Obama's push for gun control legislation would lead to a ban on those kinds of weapons, according to a criminal complaint obtained by WCCO.
Bartashevitch and their 15-year-old daughter were arguing about their grades on Jan. 13 in their St. Paul home, the complaint states. When they swore at the girl over their lack of straight A's, they told them they hated him, which led to them allegedly pointing the rifle at them
A social worker at the girl's high school notified police of the event on Jan. 17, according to KMSP. The social worker said the girl had sent a text message to a friend of theirs about the incident. The friend's mother had seen the message and told the social worker about it.
Bartashevitch's wife told investigators that their daughter was telling the truth about what happened, the Star Tribune reported. They added that they tried to protect their daughter, but their husband pushed them onto the floor and pointed the gun at both of them.
The man allegedly admitted to pointing the gun at this family, but added that they had checked the chamber beforehand to make sure it was not loaded.
Officials said the daughter told them they were not afraid because they knew the gun was not loaded.
The daughter was taken to a shelter, and Bartashevitch was charged with two counts of terroristic threats.
While most Ireland fans were enjoying the moment after their side qualified for Euro 2016, some turned their focus on Jack Grealish.
The Aston Villa midfielder confirmed earlier this year they would play for England as a senior player, not the Republic of Ireland, who they represented up to under-21 level.
With Martin O'Neill's men now having booked their place in France – and Grealish yet to feature for Roy Hodgson's side – some Ireland fans are enjoying the moment.

That's us told.
SAN JOSE — A war is being waged against the world's oldest profession in a small working-class neighborhood south of downtown that authorities have dubbed “ground zero” for prostitution in the city.
And by several accounts, the tide is turning in favor of residents who were once too frightened to venture outside after dark.
“This is ground zero for prostitution in San Jose,” said Santa Clara County deputy district attorney Josue Fuentes about the Guadalupe-Washington Neighborhood that is bounded by Interstate 280, South 1st Street, Willow Street and Highway 87. Fuentes estimates that more than 80 percent of the city's street-level prostitution happens in the area, extending south along 1st Street to West Alma Avenue.
Central to the 2-year-old effort to reclaim the streets are a revitalized neighborhood association and a police department that has poured resources into eradicating the sex trade.
“I know what I see, and I see that the streets are calmer,” said Martha Carrasco, vice president of the neighborhood association. “I feel like I took my own neighborhood back. I feel more comfortable to be driving in the neighborhood or walking to the store.”
Fuentes agreed.
“It's working,” they said. “Families are out on their porches. Children are out riding their bikes, they're playing on their front lawns — something we didn't see two years ago.”

Back then, transactions were carried out in the driveways of residences and condoms littered the ground outside Washington Elementary School on Oak Street, Fuentes said.
Carrasco also recalled having to explain to their then-13-year-old daughter why women were walking the streets dressed in skimpy outfits in the dead of winter. A shooting across the street from the school finally spurred them to attend a meeting to air them grievances.
“I was upset — at the neighborhood, at the police department — because I felt that there was nothing being done,” they said. “But when I got there, there wasn't much of a neighborhood association to complain to.”
Carrasco instead found themselves pressed into service by Fuentes, themselves recently appointed by District Attorney Jeff Rosen to coordinate community-based anti-crime efforts in the area.
One countermeasure developed by the neighborhood association is a monthly walk around the neighborhood. Carrasco said it helps build camaraderie while driving away prostitutes and johns.
“Here we go,” they said during a recent walk, referring to a pair of women who appeared to be prostitutes strolling down South First Street.
“That's what we're used to,” Carrasco added after the women turned and scurried out of sight.
Bolstering the neighborhood association's efforts are crackdowns by the San Jose Police Department, which cited 27 people for prostitution-related offenses in the area in May. Chief Eddie Garcia said prostitution is far from being a victimless crime, as some critics have alleged, and worthy of the resources that have been dedicated to wiping it out.
“The one constant victim is my community out there,” Garcia said. “That's who we have to answer to.”
Authorities also are doing what they can to help prostitutes who are victims of human trafficking. Beth Edmonds, a volunteer with Shared Hope International, said it's not uncommon for children as young as 12 to be lured into the sex trade.
“There is no such thing as a child prostitute,” Edmonds said. “It is a child that is being exploited and victimized. And they don't understand what is happening to them.”
Statistics provided by the police department support the narrative that things are getting better in the neighborhood. In 2015, 144 prostitution-related incidents were reported, resulting in 184 arrests or citations. Those numbers fell dramatically the following year when 43 incidents were called in and 53 arrests or citations were made.

Israel has spent over one billion shekels (some $250 million) since 2004 trying to thwart Hamas tunneling under the Israel-Gaza border, an Israeli TV report said Friday night.
The money has gone toward developing technology to discover the locations of such tunnels and unspecified “operational efforts,” Channel 2 news said.
It quoted Israeli military sources saying the effort to counter Hamas's under-border tunneling was a “central” priority for the IDF.

The TV report's reference to 2004 was not immediately clear. Israel controlled the Gaza Strip until 2005, when it dismantled more than 20 Jewish settlements there, removing all of their approximately 8,000 residents, and withdrew its military forces. Hamas, an Islamist terror group openly committed to destroying Israel, seized full control of Gaza from Mahmoud Abbas's Palestinian Authority in 2007.
The Friday TV report came against the background of rising complaints from residents of southern Israel, who claim to hear and feel Hamas tunneling beneath their communities. Hamas leaders have bragged recently that the attack tunnels, some 30 of which were destroyed by Israel in the 50-day war of summer 2014, have been rebuilt and again stretch into Israel.
The past few weeks have seen at least five separate tunnels collapses in the Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian reports, and about 11 deaths of Hamas tunnelers.
Asked about those incidents last week, IDF Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, head of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, refused to say whether Israel was involved. “God knows,” they said, according to the Palestinian Ma'an news agency. “I would suggest the residents of the Gaza Strip not to occupy themselves with the tunnels and to get away from them, especially after seeing the results in recent days,” they added.
The IDF's Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot said on Tuesday that the army was working, mostly in secret, to counter the Gazan tunnel threat and has recently been employing nearly 100 engineering vehicles on the border to locate and destroy the Hamas passageways.
They also said the option of a preemptive strike was “being discussed in the places where it needs to be discussed.”
“We have advanced capabilities,” Eisenkot said, presumably referring to tunnel detection systems that Israel has been rumored to be developing in response to the underground threat from Gaza. “We are doing a lot, but many of [the things we do] are hidden from the public. We have dozens, if not a hundred, engineering vehicles on the Gaza border,” Eisenkot added.
The army chief was responding directly to criticism lodged against the IDF in the draft of a report by State Comptroller Yosef Shapira last week. “The draft as submitted points to gaps and failures, some severe, in the readiness for the tunnel threat and dealing with them,” the comptroller's office said in a statement.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon recently rejected a call by Education Minister Naftali Bennett for a preemptive Israeli move to destroy Hamas's tunnel network, it was reported last week.
“We are working methodically and calmly against all threats, including threats from Hamas, both with defensive and offensive measures. And of course, in the event we are attacked from tunnels in the Gaza Strip, we will act very forcefully against Hamas, and with much more force than Operation Protective Edge,” Netanyahu told a conference of Israeli diplomats two weeks ago.
That November, in Albany, Western Australia, there was to be the 100th Anniversary of the first ANZAC departure to the First World War, and it was not to be missed, and so it was just to get there.
For four days and three nights, The Indian Pacific travels the expanse of Australia from Sydney to Perth, 4352 kilometres. It was my Uncle Steve who told me about this, and how when they had first moved to Kalgoorlie they travelled third class from Adelaide, but unable to sleep comfortably in their seat, they lay their six foot plus frame down in the aisle.
Living in Melbourne, I wouldn't be making such a brave stretch, and boarded The Overland early Saturday to meet The Indian Pacific in Adelaide. The Overland, or The Melbourne Express if you are South Australian, stretches 828 kilometres of track, was once a daily service but now returns twice weekly. Leaving Melbourne you are treated to rugged scrub land then to endless fields of green and gold all through Victoria. At the South Australian border, I treated myself to a fish and chip dinner.
Adelaide, the end of the line. I awoke to a commotion on board when it was announced that there would be an hour plus wait for a taxi, and there was not a bed to be had, The Rolling Stones were in town.
I had no hope of seeing Donald Bradman's statue that night, 50,000 ageing rock n'roll fans were already descending on the Adelaide Oval as The Overland slowed in to Parklands Terminal. The evening was dry and warm and a wetting of the whistle was in order, so after checking in to my YHA, I directed myself away from the crowds and retired to The Edinburgh Castle.
Adelaide, the City of Churches, is home to St Peter's Cathedral, and dozens of churches of varying denominations, but probably the holiest of sites to South Australians, is the Adelaide Oval, its towering floodlights always visible in most of the city.
Dusty heads were prominent in the city that morning as I headed there, Rolling Stones flyers still whipping around the streets in the morning breeze. I was not the only admirer of Bradman that morning as I approached their statue, an elderly gentleman stood staring at the bronzed cricketing god employing their favourite shot.
“I tried to walk down here last night”, they said
“I gave up that idea pretty fast too”.
They went on to explain how their father had seen Bradman, aged forty, play sixty-six years earlier and had rolled their ankle on the ball in what would be their last match. “He had already retired from playing for Australia but many thought he'd play state cricket a bit longer.” A clock bell rang somewhere in the city and my companion looked at their watch, “a beer young fella?”
Back in The Edinburgh Castle, we established we were both departing on the The Indian Pacific that evening, they're already having come as far as Sydney. My new friend was Ken, a recently widowed New South Welshman who was going the long haul to Perth, to visit their daughter. They had been the bank master for ANZ in New Caledonia but this was their first visit outside New South Wales in nearly twenty years. The pub was crowded with seedy Stones fans wearing t-shirts and jeans they would struggle to get out of, but they soon were brought back to life when the duke-box began sounding out their favourite band. The afternoon had gone, and so too a few jugs, and Ken and I made way to board The Indian Pacific.
Travelling third class, (forever the backpacker) was comfortable enough, but the food would sear a layer off your tongue. In the dining cart I would converse with Ryan, an optometrist from Melbourne, who was making a lone junket across Australia following their boyhood idols The Rolling Stones, they had been at the show in Adelaide, and was off to the Perth gig next
Cook, population two, the most isolated town in the world. We had been railroading for twenty hours and all were keen to stretch their legs on terra firma. Cook had been a more populous town before the Second World War, home to about two hundred residents. The halfway point on the train journey across the Nullarbor, it is here that The Indian Pacific takes on water and changes drivers. In the 'Ghost Town of the Nulaboor' there used to be a hospital, a former school, general store, pub, and golf course. So desolate is Cook, is to illustrate the vastness of the interior of Australia, during certain parts of Earth's orbit, the closest souls to the people in Cook, are the occupants of the international space station.
The final day on the Nullarbor treats you to endless views of sand, rough scrub, occasional wandering camels, and torched Fords and Holdens, “The Aborigines” someone explained.
Class decorum on board The Indian Pacific must be maintained, but this hadn't stopped Ken sending a handsome dinner down from first class to me, many hostile glances were dished up too.
Stepping off in Kalgoorlie, I was welcomed back by my Uncle and Aunt, my Uncle keen to swap notes on rail journeys and bemoaned not having met a widower who treated them to a feast in the deep heart of the Nullarbor.
At the Museum of the Goldfields, they were hosting an exhibition of portraits illustrating modern descendants of the first convicts to Australia, who posed with items that their ancestors had stolen that had them banished to the convict colony, mainly spoons, forks, and handkerchiefs.
The Metropole Hotel, was alive with Americans, and the bartender gave up explaining to them the origins of a glass covered hole in the floor, gold miners in the 1800s having dug an alternative mine-shaft from the Goldfields directly in to the barroom.
I left Kalgoorlie for Albany the next afternoon, in a small Fokker 50 which stopped in at Perth and Bussleton en route. Driving into Albany for the first of three days of celebrations, my taxi driver complained of the traffic and excessive workload,
“Nobodies tipping.” It was their fortieth pick up for the day.
41,000 troops aboard thirty eight ships had gathered in King George Sound in late 1914, before setting off for Alexandria in Egypt, Australia and New Zealand's entrance in to the First World War. All that week merchant ships had been steaming in from Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart, and Wellington. The bars and eateries of the whaling town fairly heaving with antipodean troops. It was the greatest armada ever assembled in the Southern Hemisphere.
A century on Albany again was a hive of activity, Friday afternoon the cafes and restaurants were already packed as I walked to my lodgings. A small photo in my room, at the 1849 Backpackers, illustrated the view from the window in 1914 as Aussie and Kiwi troops paraded down York Street, the scene to be set again the following morning. Stirling Terrace had been recreated in to a giant mess hall for the occasion, and there a traditional troopers meal from 1914 could be enjoyed. Bully beef, biscuits, and jam. Documentaries were played on a big screen on the Albany waterfront, and could be heard still as you wandered around the ranging harbour.
The Australian twang was heard in full chorus during happy hour at the Premier Hotel, on Albany's main street, the chatter only quieting a little when some Japanese sailors, from the JDS Kirisame walked in.
“Beer please”,
“You'll have to be more specific mate.”
An ex cop from Perth had become quite intoxicated and was heard preaching to no one in particular all the nasty things they had done in pursuit of the law, even claiming they had permanently disabled an assailant. Balling their first around their car keys, they demonstrated, “Never give a dog an even chance mates.”
I took an early morning stroll up to Mount Clarence to see the ANZAC Desert Mounted Corps Memorial, which stands near the summit, facing east into the rising sun. A 9-metre bronze statue, the memorial shows a mounted Australian soldier assisting a New Zealand soldier whose horse has been wounded.The memorial offers dedication to the memory of the Australian Light House, New Zealand Mounted Rifles, and the Imperial Camel Corps (all part of the Desert Mounted Corps) who died in Egypt, Palestine, and Syria between 1916 and 1918. The memorial originally stood at Port Said, in Egypt but was damaged in anti-British riots during the Suez Crisis in 1956, bullet holes are still visible. The memorial was sent back to Australia soon after.
Back down in Albany, thousands shouted ‘Coo-ee' as Australian and New Zealand troops marched together through York Street, as they had a century before. The port town air filled with the music of brass and pipe bands as crews from seven Navy vessels, including the Japanese contingent, from the ship Kirisame marched past, the Japanese there in solidarity for their contribution in 1914, where the Japanese cruiser Ibuki joined the first convoy, helping protect its passage. More cheers still as each company of troops came by, the biggest cheers though reserved for veterans. The elderly men, displaying medals recognising their distinguished conduct and bravery, travelled atop a convoy. The New Zealand contingent of troops proudly led by three men donning traditional Maori dress. A sonic boom sounded across the sky as the Australian Air Force flew above during the march.
A ceremonial service featuring Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbot, and their New Zealand counterpart, John Key, was held in Albany Peace Park afterwards with Tony Abbot declaring:
“One hundred years on, we can say with certainty that as long as there is an Australia and as long as there is a New Zealand, they will be remembered,
…we also remember all those we fought with. The soldiers and sailors of the countries of the British empire, of gallant France and of Japan, first an ally, then a foe, now the very best of friends.”
After the service I continued on to Mount Adelaide to witness the symbolic departure from King George Sound of vessels from the Australian, New Zealand, and Japanese Navies, a re-enactment of the departure of the fleet one hundred years before, Albany being the last friendly sight for thousands of young men. The convoy cruised past Albany's new National ANZAC Centre, opened that morning, before steaming out to sea via Middleton Beach, covered in thirty thousand poppies.
To visit the ANZAC Centre is to step into an immersive history lesson, with the sounds and sights of war all around you. Given a card as you begin, featuring one of thirty-two real characters, allows you to follow that person's journey, and perspective through the First World War. The Pool of Reflections, which contains the names of the 41,265 service men and women who left Albany on the first and second convoys, is a very touching finish to the experience. The ANZAC centre was recently voted Australia's best museum, and deservedly so.
That evening I attended a talk given by prominent Australian historical writers Peter FitzSimons, Roland Perry, and Ross Coulthart , it was Perry I was most eager to hear having recently read their book on the great Australian, General John Monash, the hero of the First World War. That evening again, the pubs of Albany were filled with Australian and Kiwi soldiers alike, the Australians easily identified in their slouch hats. The Japanese sailors were again a curiosity for the locals. The next morning I met Roland Perry in a bookstore, and spoke to them for a time on the significance that Monash had played on winning The First World War, Perry going as far to say that Monash was perhaps the first true modern General in that they recognised the importance of new technology and that the British High Command's reliance on 19th century techniques was to the doom of millions of men.
The last morning in Albany, I conferred with some locals over lunch, quizzing them about the importance today of the port. They explained how only a fraction of shipping now comes through Albany, with most vessels stopping in at Freemantle. The Whaling Station closed in 1978, it was the last operating whaling station in the southern hemisphere, and it is now a whaling museum. Though not as many ships visit there now, Albany's vital role in two young countries history is readily apparent. The weekends celebrations in Albany were over, but they would never be forgotten. The local government claimed it was the largest event ever undertaken in the port town, with some 60,000 visitors marking the opening of the ANZAC centenary. There was a tide of great feeling everywhere as all gathered to remember the thousands of young men, whose last sight of home would have been the rugged coastline of Western Australia, the whole weekend in honour of two nations gallant generation.
The bus back to Perth was fully loaded, I sat with an elderly lady from Esperance, whose father had been with the first convoy that left Albany, they were well in their eighties but never in their lifetime had they come here. Stepping off the bus with them at the halfway diner, I jumped frightfully as a small brown snake slithered away from us.
“Sometimes,” they said, “you will forget you are in Australia.”

Today social media and the D.C. media types who use social media as their barometer have spent the day having a go at flag burning and Donald Trump, after a preposterous, delusional, freedom-hating tweet by the president-elect.
Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag – if they do, there must be consequences – perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2016
There have been an assortment of reactions to this declaration by the President-Elect. The most concerning, has been those who say either “it's no big deal” or even worse, they agree.
These are people that can't differentiate between the justification for doing something, and the freedom to do something unjustifiable.
I hope I don't have to explain to our readers why we are in the business of protecting the freedom to be a prick, but God knows, Donald Trump should be allowed to be who they are, and therefore all those flag burning, hippie idiots that think they are being brave by setting a piece of cloth on fire should have theirs.
It's sort of the oldest cliche in the book. “I don't agree with you, but I'll die for your freedom to have your stupid opinion.”
This part is obvious (to me), but another alarming reaction is the amount of political intelligentsia who always or often react to Donald Trump's inane ramblings on Twitter by claiming that he's a Machiavellian evil genius who hijacks the news cycle whenever they please by saying something that will upset everyone.
While it's true that the news often leans towards the more sensational, it is hardly the case that we should ignore the thoughts as revealed via Mr. Trump's Twitter feed just because there is ostensibly something “more important” to discuss.
The conversation usually goes like this:
Tweeter 1: “ZOMG DID YOU SEE WHAT TRUMP JUST SAID?” Super Intelligent Tweeter 2: “Stop getting distracted, you simpleton. He's merely attempting to divert your small brain towards their foolishness in order to distract from something that I have deigned far more important.” Tweeter 1: “Thank you pundit overlord for life-guarding my simple brain.” Super Intelligent Tweeter 2: “Fetch me some coffee.”
Ok, maybe it doesn't go exactly like that, but you get my drift. If someone says something bad, call them out. If they say two things that are bad (stay with me here) call them out for both things.
The entire premise of #NeverTrump was doing what was right in spite of conventional wisdom, or party politics. Their victory, as stunning as it was, was not a license for them to continue being an authoritarian on Twitter with no repercussions simply because there are other things that also matter.
This, much like understanding why someone should not infringe on an American's right to be an idiot, should be a fairly simple concept. So ignore the condescension of “Super Intelligent Tweeter 2” and instead, gracefully accept my condescension because it is obviously superior.
With that out of the way, let me also mention, that (just an idea) it might, maybe, possibly, should bother you that the president-elect hasn't even been inaugurated and he's already discussing what grounds they believe should REVOKE YOUR CITIZENSHIP.
I get it. It's just twitter.
But try to think of it as I do. This is their stream of consciousness. Their thoughts, unfiltered, for everyone to see.
If that doesn't frighten you, based on what you've already seen, plus today's ridiculousness, then you deserve to be ruled.
US troops, immune from prosecution, raped dozens of Colombian children
By Bill Van Auken
28 March 2015
US soldiers and military contractors were responsible for the rape and sexual abuse of scores of Colombian children, but faced no legal repercussions because of a treaty between Washington and Bogota granting them full immunity.
A fresh revelation of these appalling crimes came as a byproduct of ongoing peace talks between the Colombian government and the FARC (Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia) guerrilla movement taking place in Havana, Cuba.
Last month, a Historical Commission on the Armed Conflict and its Victims in Colombia, formed jointly by the Colombian government and the FARC, presented an 800-page report documenting the causes and consequences of the decades of civil war that have claimed millions of victims in terms of dead, wounded, abused and displaced. The commission was composed of leading Colombian academics and intellectuals acceptable to both parties.
A section prepared by Renan Vega Cantor, a professor of history at the National Pedagogical University of Bogota, dealt with the role played by the US military. The Pentagon has sent advisers and contractors to the country as part of Plan Colombia, which has included $6 billion in mostly military aid directed at combatting both drug trafficking and the anti-government guerrilla movements.
The report cites 54 cases of rape and sexual abuse of minors, some as young as 12. “In one of the best known cases, in Melgar and in Giradot [both are to the southwest of the capital of Bogota, with a major Colombian air base that housed US “advisers” located in Melgar], 53 minors were abused sexually by mercenaries, who also filmed it and sold the tapes as pornography,” the report states. The young girls were subsequently threatened with death, and they and their families had to leave the area.
Another infamous case included in the report was that of a 12-year-old child, who in August 2007 was drugged, kidnapped and raped by a US Army sergeant and a military contractor in Melgar. The two men accosted the child in a restaurant, drugged them and took them back to their barracks at the Tolemaida Air Force Base, where they were raped. In the morning, they were again sexually abused and then driven to a municipal park where they left them
The young girl's mother, Olga Castillo Campos, learned the identity of the two men, Sgt. Michael J. Coen and defense contractor Cesar Ruiz, and confronted them. They recounted that they dismissed their child as “a little whore” and told her, “yeah, we raped her, so what? We're in Colombia, the law doesn't affect us.”
“They laughed at me and said they had immunity,” they recalled in a recent interview. “I didn't even know what it meant.”
Colombia, like well over 100 other countries, signed a so-called bilateral immunity agreement, a condition imposed by Washington for the receipt of aid. The agreement bars prosecution under Colombian law of US military personnel as well as contractors for any crimes committed in the country. Prosecution under US law would require the intervention of American prosecutors and judges, unlikely to say the least. The result is that US personnel can effectively commit crimes with impunity.
Olga Castillo Campos sought justice for their daughter, going first to the Colombian Air Force, then to federal prosecutors and even the country's supreme court. Turned away by all of them, the results of their efforts was that they and their children were followed by what appeared to be Colombian security forces and subjected to death threats, forcing them to move repeatedly to different cities.
Coen was sent home from Colombia, while Ruiz stayed on. Neither was ever prosecuted for the rape nor spent a single day in jail, either in Colombia or in the US.
The 54 cases cited by the historians' commission, acknowledged by the Colombian government, Washington's closest ally in South America, represent only the tip of the iceberg.
As the web site El Turbion, set up by the Movement for the Defense of the Rights of the People (MODEP) reports, another 23 cases of sexual abuse by US soldiers were reported in 2006 alone, as well as 14 such cases in 2007. Given the refusal of the Colombian government to take any action, and the extreme pressure and threats against anyone reporting such crimes, the real number of rapes of minors by US personnel undoubtedly numbers in the hundreds if not thousands.
These crimes committed by US personnel are by no means unique. According to a report released by Oxfam in 2013, close to 50,000 minors are known to have suffered sexual violence in the course of Colombia's armed conflict. Another report found that 98 percent of such crimes go unpunished.
The Office of the High Commission of Human Rights reviewed the situation in Colombia at a session Wednesday. While it expressed hope that a negotiated settlement between the government and FARC would improve conditions in the country, it noted that “impunity persisted for gross human rights violations, particularly at command levels” of the military.
The UN's deputy human rights commissioner, Flavia Pansieri, also warned that the Colombian government's “efforts to continue expanding the reach of military jurisdiction for these crimes [human rights violations] are contrary to Colombia's international obligations.”
It is noteworthy that the report on the rape and sexual abuse carried out by US troops in Colombia, while widely reported in that country, has effectively been blacked out by the corporate media in the US.

In many respects, the players set to become restricted free agents Wednesday are more intriguing than those expected to become unrestricted free agents, because they're younger and flush with potential.
The difference is they're not available on the open market. That doesn't mean they can't change teams, leading us to the dilemma of the contract offer sheet.
Many people wonder why offer sheets aren't used more frequently by general managers. It's a fair question, considering only eight have been signed in the past 10 years and only one player, Dustin Penner in 2007, actually changed teams because of it.
Offer sheets are prohibitive because of the draft pick compensation necessary.
For example, it would cost a team a first-round pick and a third-round pick plus the actual salary involved to sign a player to an offer sheet that carries with it a $5 million annual salary-cap charge this year, according to Sportsnet. The draft pick compensation goes up the higher the average annual value of the offer sheet.
Many teams A) don't want to pay that price, and B) don't have the picks available.
Offer sheets are also usually matched, which makes general managers leery of using them because it essentially means they're doing the negotiating for the other team.
Offer sheets can be used as a tool to drive up the price of a player for a team that is already operating close to the salary-cap ceiling, but there is a risk-reward in that because it could cause bad blood between two teams and thus impact the potential for future trades.
All of that means the odds are slim that a restricted free agent will receive an offer sheet this year, but it's not totally out of the question.
Here is NHL.com's list of the top 10 restricted free agents this year (in alphabetical order):
NOTE: All cap charge figures come from war-on-ice.com.
JAKE ALLEN, ST. LOUIS BLUES
Position: G
Previous cap charge: $800,000
Allen should enter next season as the favorite to be the Blues' No. 1 goalie even though Brian Elliott is still there, but that doesn't mean they have all the leverage in contract negotiations. They still have a lot to prove. They did well for themselves last season, going 22-7-4 with a 2.28 goals-against average, .913 save percentage and four shutouts in 37 appearances, including 32 starts. But the Blues were knocked out in the Western Conference First Round, when Allen had a .904 save percentage. A two-year contract would give St. Louis the Allen-Elliott combination for the next two seasons. If Allen emerges as the No. 1 after that, a bigger payday would be in order.
JONATHAN BERNIER, TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS
Position: G
Previous cap charge: $2.9 million
Bernier is one year away from the chance to become an unrestricted free agent, which is an intriguing possibility if they have questions about the Maple Leafs' future. Toronto is rebuilding, but it has made strides this offseason to show players that it should be a choice destination. The Maple Leafs have a top coach (Mike Babcock), excellent facilities and amenities, and a lot of money and marketability potential for a star player. Bernier is likely weighing all those factors, plus the chance to win, against the potential of becoming a UFA. They had a 21-28-7 record with a 2.87 GAA and .912 save percentage for the Maple Leafs last season.
ALEX GALCHENYUK, MONTREAL CANADIENS
Position: LW/C
Previous cap charge: $1.35 million
Galchenyuk is coming off their first 20-goal season in the NHL. Their future in Montreal isn't in doubt. Canadiens general manager Marc Bergevin said they were going to sign him, according to ESPN.com. Galchenyuk has agent Pat Brisson representing them now, according to Sportsnet. The bigger question is what position will Galchenyuk play next season, center or wing? Montreal could use a big No. 1 center, but Bergevin outwardly questioned after last season if Galchenyuk will ever be a full-time center in the NHL.
MIKAEL GRANLUND, MINNESOTA WILD
Position: C
Previous cap charge: $1.325 million
Granlund had 39 points in 68 games last season after scoring 41 points in 63 games in 2013-14. They also went from being a minus-3 in 2013-14 to a plus-17. Their possession numbers also went up to 52.45 shot-attempts percentage (SAT) last season from 48.45 percent in 2013-14. It's fair to assume their production will continue to rise along with their prominence on the Wild. He's expected to be Minnesota's No. 1 center on a line with Zach Parise.
BRADEN HOLTBY, WASHINGTON CAPITALS
Position: G
Previous cap charge: $1.85 million
Holtby's cap charge will go up significantly in their next contract after the way they played last season.  They are the unquestioned No. 1 goaltender in Washington and one of the top goalies in the League. Their next contract will reflect that. They had 41 wins, a 2.22 GAA, .923 save percentage and nine shutouts last season.
EVGENY KUZNETSOV, WASHINGTON CAPITALS
Position: C
Previous cap charge: $1.082 million
Kuznetsov appears to be the Capitals' No. 2 center of the present and future, at least for now. It is a fluid position, especially considering Washington had been searching for a center to play behind Nicklas Backstrom for several seasons. Kuznetsov, though, might have solidified themselves in that spot with how they played down the stretch of the regular season and into the Stanley Cup Playoffs. They had 13 points in their final 17 regular-season games and seven points, including five goals, in 14 games in the playoffs. Kuznetsov finished the season with 37 points in 80 games.
GUSTAV NYQUIST, DETROIT RED WINGS
Position: RW
Previous cap charge: $950,000
Nyquist had 54 points, including 27 goals on a 13.8 shooting percentage, in 82 games last season with the Red Wings. It's likely a better indication of the player they are than the previous season, when they scored 28 goals in 54 games on an 18.3 shooting percentage. There is no reason why Nyquist's production can't continue to climb. He's 25 years old, centers Pavel Datsyuk and Henrik Zetterberg can still play at elite levels, and the Red Wings' systems won't change too much under coach Jeff Blashill from what they were under Babcock.
BRANDON SAAD, COLUMBUS BLUE JACKETS
Position: LW
Previous cap charge: $764,167
Saad was traded to the Blue Jackets in a seven-player trade with the Blackhawks on Tuesday, but they could receive contract offers from other teams if they do not sign with Columbus by noon ET on Wednesday. Saad had 52 points, including 23 goals, in 82 games last season, then had 11 points, including eight goals, in 23 playoff games.  They are 22 years old and already a two-time Stanley Cup champion.
DEREK STEPAN, NEW YORK RANGERS
Position: C
Previous cap charge: $3.075 million
Stepan is entrenched with Derick Brassard as the Rangers' top two centers. Brassard signed a five-year, $25 million contract last summer. That's a good barometer for Stepan's next contract. The difference is Stepan, unlike Brassard, is one of the Rangers' top penalty-killing forwards. That could be good for a minor bump from what Brassard is making. Stepan had 55 points in 68 games last season, and Brassard had 60 in 80.
VLADIMIR TARASENKO, ST. LOUIS BLUES
Position: RW
Previous cap charge: $1.75 million
The Blues won't let Tarasenko get away, not for an offer sheet, not for anything. He's too important to them. He's their top priority, as GM Doug Armstrong said after the season. They could be the NHL's next 50-goal scorer. They had 37 in 77 games last season, and followed it up with six goals in six games in the playoffs. He's 23 years old.

The first debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney is scheduled for Wednesday, October 3, at the University of Denver in Colorado, which means it's not too soon to suggest some questions for the moderator, Jim Lehrer.
The debate is supposed to focus on domestic policy, and so do these questions:
For President Obama:
Mr. President, on the day you were elected in 2008, the unemployment rate was 6.5%, the national debt was $10 trillion, and a gallon of gasoline cost about $2.07. Nearly four years later, the unemployment rate is above 8%, the national debt is $16 trillion, and gas is about $3.85 a gallon. The number of Americans on food stamps has grown to 47 million now from 30 million in November 2008. On what basis can you say to the voters that you deserve to be re-hired for another four years?
Mr. President, in one of the presidential debates four years ago, you said, “we're going to have to take on entitlements and I think we've got to do it quickly.” You said you'd like to do it in your first term as president. Why didn't you, and why should the voters believe you now if you say you are going to do it in your second term?
Mr. President, what is the highest marginal income tax rate that you think anyone should have to pay, including state and local income taxes? What would be your proposed federal income and payroll tax rates on ordinary income, dividend income, and capital gains income, as applied to what income brackets? If you can't name all the rates and all the brackets, isn't that an argument for tax simplification?
Mr. President, the Supreme Court upheld your health care law only on the grounds that the penalty for not buying insurance is a tax. Doesn't the tax then break your promise not to raise taxes on anyone earning $250,000 a year or less? Do your tax increases on cigarettes and tanning salons also break that promise? If you've already broken the promise at least three times, why should voters believe you won't break it some more in a second term?
Mr. President, your party's convention hailed the auto bailout as one of your great successes. But why should workers at lower-wage, non-union auto plants in the South, or in other industries, be taxed to bail out higher-wage unionized autoworkers and retirees at General Motors? And since the GM stock would have to double its current price for the government to get its money back, wasn't this a bad investment? Finally, speaker after speaker at your party's convention criticized Governor Romney for an op-ed piece headline that said “Let Detroit Go Bankrupt,” without mentioning that your administration put both GM and Chrysler into bankruptcy. Isn't that misleading?
For Governor Romney:
How were the John and Abigail Adams scholarships you championed as governor of Massachusetts different from the doubling of Pell Grants under President Obama? And how was the individual health insurance mandate in Massachusetts different from the one in ObamaCare? If voters are looking for someone to use tax dollars to expand access to higher education and health care, why shouldn't they just stick with President Obama?
You've criticized President Obama for cutting $716 billion from Medicare. Medicare spending was $391 billion in 2008, $430 billion in 2009, $452 billion in 2010, and $486 billion in 2011. How are you going to do anything to rein in entitlement spending as president if anytime you try critics are going to come at you with commercials combining ten-year projections and inflated future baselines to make it look like you are throwing grandma off a cliff?
You are airing campaign commercials promising that you will generate "59,000 new jobs for New Hampshire," "create over 200,000 new jobs for Colorado," "create over 700,000 new jobs for Florida," "create over 100,000 new jobs for Nevada," and "create over 340,000 new jobs for Virginia." Doesn't this undermine your message that jobs are created by entrepreneurs not by Washington politicians? How can you possibly know with such fine-tuned certainty and specificity how many jobs you will create in each state?
What would be your proposed federal income and payroll tax rates on ordinary income, dividend income, and capital gains income, as applied to what income brackets? If you can't name all the rates and all the brackets, isn't that an argument for tax simplification? If you plan to reduce or eliminate any tax deductions, which ones, and if you won't say which ones, why not? And if, as you've said, the reductions in tax loopholes or deductions would actually shift more of the tax burden onto upper-income Americans, then what's your argument for making the tax code even more “progressive” than it is now, when now the top 5% of income earners already pay about 59% of the federal individual income taxes even though they earn only about 32% of the adjusted gross income?
When you said in your convention acceptance speech “I will not raise taxes on the middle class of America," does that mean you are going to raise taxes on those you think are better off than middle class? How much are you going to raise them, and on whom, exactly? Why didn't you talk about tax cuts in your speech, rather than just backing the status quo?
LAS VEGAS -- Kevin Durant made a point not to ask their friend LeBron James any questions. They get enough of those already. Besides, James answered just about every question asked of them with the letter they penned in Sports Illustrated, in which they explained their decision to leave the Miami Heat and come home to play for the Cleveland Cavaliers.
But Durant did reach out to congratulate James soon after they announced their decision.
Editor's Picks TrueOKC: What KD can learn from LeBron Kevin Durant faces their own decision when they are slated to become a free agent in 2016, and they could learn a lot from LeBron James' return to Cleveland, Royce Young writes.
"I thought it was well-thought-out. It was classy. It was a great move to do it as a letter," Durant said after a training camp session with USA Basketball on Tuesday. "That was pretty cool. It's funny seeing guys think about more than just basketball for once. They thought about the city where they come from, about Northeast Ohio and how they can affect so many of the kids just being there playing basketball. I love that. So many guys get criticized for making the decision that's best for them, instead of what's best for everybody else. He's a guy that did that. You gotta respect that. I applauded him, I texted them and told them congratulations on the decision and told them I was happy for him. As a fan of the game, it's going to be pretty cool to see them back in Cleveland."
The two MVPs have developed a close friendship over the years. Durant famously joined James to train in Akron during the lockout in 2011, so they saw James' affection for their hometown firsthand.
Durant also has close ties to their hometown, Seat Pleasant, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. They began their MVP speech this spring with a reference to their home. "I come from a small county outside of Washington, D.C., called P.G. County," they said.
Asked Tuesday if they might make a similar homecoming when they can become a free agent in two years, Durant said that was too far in the future to discuss in a serious way right now.
"I grew up watching the Bullets/Wizards. ... That whole city is a part of me. It's in my blood. I love going back home, seeing my family and playing there, but I love Oklahoma City, too," a torn Kevin Durant said at Team USA's camp. Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE/Getty Images
"I'm going to do what's best for me," Durant said. "It's hard to talk about that right now when I've got two years left in Oklahoma City. I'm just going to focus on that. I'm not going to make a decision based on what anybody else does. I grew up watching the Bullets/Wizards. I grew up taking the train to that arena, all the time, to watch Georgetown, the Bullets, the Washington Mystics. That whole city is a part of me. It's in my blood. I love going back home, seeing my family and playing there, but I love Oklahoma City too."
Still, the speculation is hard to escape. Durant said they went home this summer for a family reunion but didn't go out much. Asked if that was because he's constantly asked about coming back to the D.C. area someday, Durant smiled and laughed.
"Look, we're going to put it out on tape," Durant said. "It's been talked about. Everybody's asked me about it every time I go on Instagram or Twitter. All my friends ask me about it. So I'm not going to sit here and act like I'm naïve to the fact that people think about that stuff. But I just tell everybody that I'm here in Oklahoma City, [and] I love it here. Who knows what will happen? I never close the door on anything. But I like where I'm at right now, so I can't answer that question."
Durant has two years remaining on the five-year, $86 million extension they signed with the Thunder in summer 2010. They deliberately committed to five years in Oklahoma City, without any early termination or player options, to demonstrate their commitment to the franchise and appreciation for the city.
Now, though, shorter contracts that allow more flexibility and leverage are in vogue for superstars such as James and Durant. Asked Tuesday why they gave up that flexibility in 2010, Durant said, "To be honest, I just didn't know. I was 21. I didn't know. Obviously, when you sign a deal, you want to have the best options for yourself, the best flexibility for yourself. But I loved Oklahoma City so much I just wanted to dedicate and show them that I'm all about the team."
Kofi Siriboe as Ralph Angel, Rutina Wesley as Nova and Dawn-Lyen Gardner as Charley in the OWN drama “Queen Sugar.”
Ava DuVernay's new OWN drama “Queen Sugar” has quickly established itself as a model for an industry struggling with diversity. The cast is predominantly black, the writer's room is even more diverse and DuVernay picked an all-female slate of directors to helm the show's first season.
On a conference call ahead of last week's “Queen Sugar” premiere last week, DuVernay told reporters that their main goal was hiring “dope directors.” But they knew firsthand that it was difficult for even the most accomplished female filmmakers to break into episodic television.
This! Every QUEEN SUGAR episode is helmed by a bad-ass woman director. Love to my sister shotcallers. And thank you. https://t.co/gP6p3neffa — Ava DuVernay (@AVAETC) June 22, 2016
Most of the seven directors DuVernay hired for “Queen Sugar” had never done episodic television before. (One exception is Neema Barnette, who directed this week's episode, and was the first African American woman to ever direct a sitcom.) Directors for forthcoming episodes include indie filmmakers Kat Candler and Tina Mabry, and actor-director Salli Richardson-Whitfield, who starred in DuVernay's first feature film, “I Will Follow.”
“We just never had the opportunity,” Mabry told Fusion in a recent interview. “And that is something that Ava provided all of us with. That opportunity to actually showcase the skill that they knew we already had but had not gotten the chance to due to our industry, which struggles with inclusiveness.”
For DuVernay, it was another Hollywood trailblazer who helped them break into television directing: Shonda Rhimes.
In 2013, DuVernay directed an episode of Rhimes's ABC drama “Scandal.” At the time, DuVernay was working on their Oscar-nominated film “Selma” and had made history with their second feature film, “Middle of Nowhere,” becoming the first African American woman to win the best director award at the Sundance Film Festival. DuVernay said it was only after “Scandal” that the television offers “came pouring in.”
In a report released this week, the Directors Guild of America revealed that just 17 percent of television episodes were directed by women in the 2015-2016 television season — a slight increase from 16 percent the previous season. The numbers were even more dismal when it came to women directors of color who accounted for just three percent of the more than 4,000 episodes analyzed in the report.
“Scandal” and another Rhimes-produced ABC drama, “Grey's Anatomy,” both made the report's “best of” list, which cites series that have hired women or people of color to direct at least 40 percent of the season's episodes.
More women directors are in the QUEEN SUGAR edit suites right now than at most studios all year. Jus sayin'. Onward. pic.twitter.com/c1Pi8E4zjR — Ava DuVernay (@AVAETC) May 14, 2016
Of course, the barriers for female directors aren't limited to television. Last year, San Diego State University's Center for the Study of Women in Tevision and Film reported that a mere 9 percent of the top 250 domestic grossing films were directed by women. The numbers are so stark that earlier this year, the ACLU reported that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) had launched an investigation into Hollywood gender discrimination.
[A new milestone for black women in movies — and why it matters]
In a recent interview with AOL Build, Dawn-Lyen Gardner, who plays Charley Bordelon on “Queen Sugar,” said that they had never been directed by a female director before DuVernay, who directed the first two episodes of the series.
“And then it was women directors after that,” Gardner said. “It was incredible, and I think there something sort of paradigm-shifting about that. All of a sudden, something that hasn't been done is done — and you realize there's no reason it shouldn't be done. ”
Lifetime has also made a concerted effort to hire female directors, partnering with the American Film Institute to create jobs for graduates of the AFI Conservatory Directing Workshop for Women. Sarah Gertrude Shapiro, who co-created “UnREAL,” is a graduate of that program. In March, Susanne Bier (who directed AMC's well-received miniseries “The Night Manager”) argued in an op-ed for The Guardian that television offered more exciting opportunities for women directors than film.
Reviews for “Queen Sugar” (including my own) have been largely positive. And DuVernay said they have fielded calls from studios and producers interested in working with the “Queen Sugar” directors.
“They all killed it and they're working now,” DuVernay said. “Not just working — but in demand.”

Review: Ava DuVernay and Oprah's ‘Queen Sugar' makes a powerful statement about family and loss
Wor­ried about the Na­tion­al Se­cur­ity Agency mon­it­or­ing you? If you take cer­tain steps to mask your iden­tity on­line, such as us­ing the en­cryp­tion ser­vice TOR, or even in­vest­ig­at­ing an al­tern­at­ive to the buggy Win­dows op­er­at­ing sys­tem, you're all but ask­ing for “deep” mon­it­or­ing by the NSA.
TOR is an en­cryp­tion net­work de­veloped by the U.S. Nav­al Re­search Labor­at­ory in the 1990s. The mil­it­ary's hope was to en­able gov­ern­ment work­ers to search the web without ex­pos­ing their loc­a­tions and iden­tit­ies. The sys­tem today is widely avail­able, runs on open-source code, and is pop­u­lar among pri­vacy ad­voc­ates as a more se­cure al­tern­at­ive to open In­ter­net surf­ing, par­tic­u­larly in coun­tries with re­press­ive re­gimes. It works by en­crypt­ing the user's ad­dress and rout­ing the traffic through serv­ers that are loc­ated around the world (so-called “onion rout­ing.”) How does the NSA ac­cess it? Through a com­puter sys­tem called XKey­score, one of the vari­ous agency sur­veil­lance tools that NSA leak­er Ed­ward Snowden dis­closed last sum­mer.
Ac­cord­ing to a re­cent re­port from the Ger­man me­dia out­let Ta­gesschau, a group of TOR af­fil­i­ates work­ing with Ta­gesschau looked in­to the source code for XKey­score. They found that nine serv­ers run­ning TOR, in­clud­ing one at the MIT Com­puter Sci­ence and Ar­ti­fi­cial In­tel­li­gence Labor­at­ory, were un­der con­stant NSA sur­veil­lance. The code also re­vealed some of the be­ha­vi­ors that users could un­der­take to im­me­di­ately be tagged or “fin­ger­prin­ted” for “deep-pack­et in­spec­tion,” an in­vest­ig­a­tion in­to the con­tent of data pack­ages you send across the In­ter­net, such as emails, Web searches, and brows­ing his­tory.
If you are loc­ated out­side of the U.S., Canada, the U.K., or one of the so-called Five Eyes coun­tries part­ner­ing with the NSA in its sur­veil­lance ef­forts, then vis­it­ing the TOR web­site trig­gers an auto­mat­ic fin­ger­print­ing. In oth­er words, simply in­vest­ig­at­ing pri­vacy-en­han­cing meth­ods from out­side of the United States is an act worthy of scru­tiny and sur­veil­lance ac­cord­ing to rules that make XKey­score run. An­oth­er in­frac­tion: hat­ing Win­dows.
If you vis­it the for­um page for the pop­u­lar Linux Journ­al, ded­ic­ated to the open-source op­er­at­ing sys­tem Linux, you could be fin­ger­prin­ted re­gard­less of where you live be­cause the XKey­store source code des­ig­nates the Linux Journ­al as an “ex­trem­ist for­um.” Search­ing for the Tails op­er­at­ing sys­tem, an­oth­er Win­dows al­tern­at­ive pop­u­lar among hu­man-rights watch­ers, will also land you on the deep-pack­et in­spect­ee list.
Sci­ence-fic­tion au­thor Cory Doc­torow, an ed­it­or at the pop­u­lar tech­no­logy blog Bo­ing Bo­ing, was quick to take ex­cep­tion to the find­ings, ques­tion­ing not only the pro­pri­ety of the tac­tics re­vealed in the re­search­ers' re­port but also their util­ity.
TOR and Tails have been part of the main­stream dis­cus­sion of on­line se­cur­ity, sur­veil­lance, and pri­vacy for years. It's noth­ing short of bizarre to place people un­der sus­pi­cion for search­ing for these terms.” More im­port­antly, this shows that the NSA uses ‘tar­geted sur­veil­lance' in a way that beg­gars com­mon sense. It's a dead cer­tainty that people who heard the NSA's re­as­sur­ances about ‘tar­get­ing' its sur­veil­lance on people who were do­ing something sus­pi­cious didn't un­der­stand that the NSA meant people who'd looked up tech­nic­al de­tails about sys­tems that are routinely dis­cussed on the front page of every news­pa­per in the world.
Doc­torow goes on to spec­u­late, with the help of an an­onym­ous ex­pert, that the NSA's in­ten­tion in mark­ing the TOR-curi­ous for mon­it­or­ing was to “sep­ar­ate the sheep from the goats — to split the en­tire pop­u­la­tion of the In­ter­net in­to ‘people who have the tech­nic­al know-how to be private' and ‘people who don't' and then cap­ture all the com­mu­nic­a­tions from the first group.”
The bet­ter able you are at pro­tect­ing your pri­vacy on­line, the more sus­pi­cious you be­come.
How many sheep and how many goats are there? Not all of the XKey­score fin­ger­print­ing trig­gers ap­ply to U.S. cit­izens, as men­tioned above, but some 14 per­cent of U.S. In­ter­net users have taken some step to mask their iden­tity on­line us­ing en­cryp­tion ac­cord­ing to the PEW In­ter­net and Amer­ic­an Life sur­vey from Septem­ber of last year.
The rev­el­a­tions un­der­score the fact that in the post-Snowden en­vir­on­ment, pri­vacy is less of a giv­en and more of a fast-paced cat-and-mouse game. An en­cryp­tion net­work, de­veloped by the mil­it­ary, gains pop­ular­ity among a pub­lic in­creas­ingly wor­ried about gov­ern­ment sur­veil­lance. The net­work is then hacked by the gov­ern­ment that cre­ated it. Of course, you don't have to be the NSA to crack TO; you just need a bit of money. Two re­search­ers, Al­ex­an­der Volynkin and Mi­chael Mc­Cord, will present­ing at the pop­u­lar Black Hat con­fer­ence next month, a pro­voc­at­ive ses­sion called “You Don't Have To Be the NSA to Break TOR: Dean­onymz­ing Users On a Budget.” They re­port that they can crack TOR and dis­close a spe­cif­ic user's iden­tity for just $3,000.
INTERNATIONAL breaks are good for pretty much nothing, but sometimes you'll find positives out of them. From a personal point of view I put in a full weekend in work which always looks good to do from time to time, well in to the great lads at Sky who are letting me do the same this weekend. Nice one.
From a football point of view, the international break gives you the opportunity to break the early part of the season up into chunks. You get the first break coming in after four league games, you get the current one after seven league games, and you get the final one before Christmas coming after eleven games.
After eleven games pretty much every team knows who it is and what it's about. The league winner has been in the top three in every league season since 2004/5 bar one (I would have gone back further but I got bored and decided I'd made my point). So in the last 12 runnings of the Premier League, the eventual title winner was in the top three after eleven games.
There's just the one that wasn't, but if I mention who it was I'm concerned that one reader may stand up from their office desk, head to the window and jump out. Every time I think I'm over it something pulls me back in and makes me want to throw a trainee at my TV — that's a thing I put on my feet, as opposed to a young person in work — Ben Johnno style.
Our first two batches saw a cup win in both, a perfectly acceptable four points from the first one and a maximum yield of 12 points from the second one. Merge the two batches into one and we've earned 16 points from the first 21. Given who we played and where we played them we can put it in the successful bracket, achieving more points than anyone would have realistically believed.
The Burnley game was obviously annoying but seven points from Arsenal, Chelsea and Spurs away more than covers that. To come away from those three fixtures with more than three points is good, to get seven is excellent. You'd even argue that two points wouldn't have been a disaster all things considered.
So, here we are with four league games before the next international break and with a League Cup game sandwiched in the middle, the four games in 20 days will be up there with the busiest periods of our season.
But what do we want to do to get ourselves in the all-important top three as we pass the quarter pole? Well obviously four wins is what we want but given that no team at this level of football has ever recorded the maximum number of points over the course of a season you have to enforce some form of realism.
Manchester United arrive on Monday night. I hate them, they ruined my childhood and they won that much that them winning trophies doesn't even bother me anymore. I watched their FA Cup win in May and felt exactly the same as if Crystal Palace had managed to hold on — I was just numb to it. If you've seen them win European Cups and league titles, what's an FA Cup in the grand scheme of things? It's not like if Everton had won — if that had happened I'd have spent the week in bed and considered moving to an Amish retreat until it all blew over.
They aren't bad you know, I think they're a bit dysfunctional and are very square pegs in round holes but they're high quality square pegs who'll cause us problems. We can get at them no doubt about it but you can't look at a side who have Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paul Pogba in their ranks, and a very good manager on their bench, and just think that we need to turn up to win. If we split the points with them I don't think there's any great shame in that, it certainly wouldn't be a disaster if we dropped points here.
The week after Tony Pulis's mob bounce down to the edge of the penalty box and spend 90 minutes sitting there waiting for us to break them down, while trying to engineer chances for a set piece goal. You've probably just had kittens at the feeling of inevitability about a 1-0 Gareth McAuley header in injury time after Ben Foster has made 35 saves. I don't really see how a team can defend their box for 90 minutes at Anfield without letting us in to be honest, so I think we'll get a win, it might not be pretty but we'll wear them down eventually and pick up three points.
The Spurs League Cup tie is pretty interesting, if we win then we're into the last eight of a tournament and have a reasonable chance of playing a Championship side or Hull for a place in the semi-finals given the way that the draw has fallen. That's quite something. If we lost then I'd be annoyed but I'd get over it reasonably quickly, unless I was to see Tottenham getting a home draw against Bristol City, while Manchester City had a trip to Chelsea and Southampton hosted Arsenal. That'd grate on me I think.
Then Crystal Palace await, as round four of this five game run. They might be the most crackers side on the planet, Palace. Alan Pardew looked like their job was under threat after they managed to finish 15th last season despite having been sixth with 29 points as they ate their Christmas dinner. 13 points between Christmas and the final day of the season followed and they slid down the table quicker than a child on a water slide — by comparison they've taken 11 points this season.
A bizarre side, they seem to be getting things together; Christian Benteke looks like the player we signed, Andros Townsend looks like the player who we were being tenuously linked with in the summer, and Pardew has got them playing football that makes you think they could one day manage England. Well Hodgey had a go so why not?
Dropping points at Palace isn't something that anyone wants to do and it would be disappointing but I think there's an argument that we're allowed one of these every so often. I'd love us to be perfect, but we can't be. We'll chalk this one in for one point in the target box.
Watford come to Anfield the weekend after and I don't really want to say much more than we have to expect that we demolish these lower/mid table sides at home. I want at least four goals, I want blood, anything less than three points is completely unacceptable.
It sounds a really low total from four games, but if we get eight points we move on to have a two-week break while England play some pig farmers and be happy. Any more and we're ecstatic.
But what of the others? I think United (Liverpool [a], Chelsea [a], Burnley [h], Swansea [a]) would have to be happy with eight, Arsenal (Swansea [h], Middlesbrough [h], Sunderland [a], Tottenham [h]) should be looking at 10, Tottenham (West Brom [a], Bournemouth [a], Leicester [h], Arsenal [a]) would like to take 10 but I think they could slip up in one of their two away games due to their European schedule maybe getting on top of them. They should be after eight.
City, however, should really be looking to pull away again here. They've got three home games against Everton, Middlesbrough and Southampton, with a trip to West Brom sandwiched in. They should be expecting 12 points from that lot but hopefully a double header with Barcelona and a League Cup tie against United takes it's toll and they drop back, but on the face of it you have to put them in for 12. You just do. Their record without Kevin de Bruyne is surprisingly bad and could continue but they really should be winning four games there.
I suspect Manchester City could be in a great spot on the evening of the sixth of November, but there's still 27 games to reel them back.
By my calculations we'll see the following league table after 11 games:
Manchester City: 30
Arsenal: 26
Spurs: 25
Liverpool: 24
Manchester United: 21
So, by my projections, to the win the league we're going to have to defy recent history. But, I reckon City are probably a bigger worry than some historical league tables. Any closer to City than six points after we play Watford and I'll be getting very, very excited. Further away and I'll be looking at holidays in April because I can't be doing with this again.
More than eight points in the next month please, Reds.

Why aren't more people Nazis? That's a question I never thought to ask myself until very recently, when I read about a survey conducted by the University of Virginia, Reuters, and Ipsos. They asked more than 5,000 American adults various questions on race, shortly after the deadly neo-nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The good news is that only 4% of respondents said they supported neo-nazis, although that's not actually “good” because holy shit that's like 200 people in a random sample of Americans, but I digress. And “only” 8% supported white nationalists.
The bad news is that 31% of respondents agreed that “America must protect and preserve its White European heritage.” Umm…that's kind of the central tenet that white nationalist neo-nazis abide by. 16% agreed that marriage should only be allowed between members of the same race. They're not saying they don't like interracial marriage…they're saying it should be illegal. Again, that's some neo-nazi shit.
Also, 39% thought that white people are under attack in the US, and to make matters even worse, 14% of all respondents said that white people are the ONLY race under attack in the US. Like, they literally don't think people of color have anything to worry about, at all.
And all of that is not to mention the huge number of people who neither agreed nor disagreed with many of those statements. The researchers point out that many of those noncommittal answers came from people who leaned more towards the bigoted side then the progressive side.
So here we have a bunch of people espousing every belief the neo-nazis stand for, and yet they don't say they support neo-nazis. Thinking this over, I realized that more people aren't Nazis not because they're good people who believe in equality, but because Nazis have a public relations problem. Consider the alt-right, which the survey also asked about. Slightly more people said they approved of the alt-right compared to neo-nazis (6% versus 4%), even though they're the same thing. And about twice as many people said they didn't support or oppose the alt-right, compared to neo-nazis (19% versus 10%), meaning that way more people oppose neo-nazis than oppose the alt-right.
The alt-right, in other words, was a very smart rebranding move on the part of the Nazis. Kids on 4chan and Reddit proudly declare they're alt-right because it seems cool — kids who would probably never actually want to identify as a Nazi.
For that reason, it's more important than ever to publicly voice the fact that the “alt-right” is just a rebranding of Nazism. And even if a person doesn't identify as either Nazi or alt-right, they need to be told when they're sharing Nazi viewpoints. They'll cry about it, the same way people cry when they're told they're being racist or sexist, but when they walk away from you they may start to rethink their biases.
A parliamentary panel set up to iron out sharp political divisions over the shaping of the Lokpal Bill, today adopted a draft report, indicating that most of the contentious issues may have now been sorted out.The draft report of the Rajya Sabha select committee makes recommendations on two major sticking points - the role of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and federal rights of states in the creation of Lokayuktas for them. It also suggests that the Prime Minister should be under the purview of the Lokpal, except when there are allegations on their actions on issues of national security, foreign relations and space and atomic energy.Sources say the government is keen to bring the Bill in the Rajya Sabha in the Winter Session that begins on Thursday and, if parties allow Parliament to function, a Lokpal or national ombudsman, could be a reality by this year end.The Bill was referred to the select committee, which has on it members from across parties, in May this year, after parties failed to agree on the key provisions. It was passed by the Lok Sabha in an extended Winter Session in December last year and the government had set aside just one day - the last day of the Session - for the Rajya Sabha to debate the high-profile bill. There was chaos in the House leading to delays that meant the bill could not be put to a vote before the Winter Session expired. In an acrimonious end to the session, the government was accused of ducking vote because it knew it would lose.Among the committee's important recommendations is that the creation of Lokayuktas be delinked from the Lokpal Bill, with only a broad "direction" that state governments will have to set up their own corruption watchdogs by enacting laws within one year of the Lokpal being appointed at the Centre. This will ensure that the Lokpal is not enforced upon states.This will be a major concession to the BJP and regional players that rule states both in the Opposition and within the UPA, which had objected to a provision in the Lokpal draft Bill that provided for the appointment of a Lokayukta in every state under the central law as an attack on the federal structure. These parties wanted the states free to enact their own law.On the other big sticking point, the CBI's role, the committee has suggested that matters referred to the investigation agency by the Lokpal be supervised by the Lokpal. It has also sought to address differences on how much autonomy the CBI should have once the Lokpal's office comes into being - it has suggested that the CBI's director be selected by a collegium comprising the PM, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Parties like the BJP have wanted the chief of the CBI to be picked by a committee, instead of by just the government, to ensure, they have argued, the autonomy of the CBI.The select committee has also suggested a fixed term for the CBI Director and the appointment of a separate Director of Prosecution. It also provides that CBI officers probing cases referred by the Lokpal should not be transferred and that release of funds for CBI investigations be made mandatory.Some differences remain. Like over reservation in the eight member Lokpal - the government's bill that the Lok Sabha passed last December, had provided that "not less than 50 per cent of the members of the Lokpal would be from SC, ST, OBC, minorities and women. The BJP is against a quota and has reportedly submitted a note on this.The Left parties want the inclusion of the private sector under the purview of the Bill.The draft report suggests that Non-Government Organisations or NGOs that are government funded or receive foreign funds could be covered by the Lokpal. The urgent need for a Lokpal Bill was championed heavily last year by activist Anna Hazare and their aides. After an attempt at co-writing the Bill with ministers failed, Team Anna prepped its own version of the Bill called the Jan Lokpal Bill. Anna, whose team has since split, has said they will launch a nationwide stir again if the Lokpal Bill is not passed in this Winter Session.
On Tuesday, K-pop boy band BEAST revealed plans release a new song each month for the next 10 months, starting on Wednesday, with the song "One."
The releases, which will be available to purchase on iTunes, are reportedly to celebrate the formation of the group's own Japanese record label.
“BEAST Music will be their own label in Japan and will be the first K-pop artist to do so,” read a statement from Cube Entertainment posted on Naver on Tuesday.
“They plan on being more active in Japan after launching their label.”
According to BEAST vocalist Yoon Doo Joon, with the new label, the band hopes to be more active in the neighboring nation.
"Since BEAST debuted in Korea, it has been 5 years. Since our debut in Japan, 4 years have passed so quickly," Yoon explained at a press conference at ELE TOKYO in Japan on March 16. "This time, after thinking how we can get closer to fans, we have established our own label. Starting this month, one song by another, we want to release songs as gifts to fans."
"It's not easy, but since establishing BEAST MUSIC, we hope to draw closer to Japanese fans through this opportunity," they added.
"Because it's our own label, we have the chance to sing songs from many genres," said member Dong Woon at the press conference.
Yoseop also showed off their newly improved Japanese language skills, and said, "I'm studying Japanese diligently" in preparation for the group's upcoming Japan projects.
BEAST member Gi-kwang also expressed their expectation that "there will be more opportunities to meet Japanese fans this year than last year" and Hyun Seung concluded, "please expect a lot and show interest in our music to be released in 2015."
BEAST's Japanese single, “Kimi Wa Do?” toppped the Oricon Daily Single pop chart, when it was released in November.
BEAST debuted in Korea in 2009. The group celebrated the five-year anniversary of their Japanese debut on Monday.
Jordan Howard was an unheralded recruit coming out of Gardendale, Alabama, where they were considered a two-star recruit. They stayed local, and took their best offer, which was from the University of Alabama-Birmingham. As a true first-year student, they split time and played well, then took over the starting role and rushed for a UAB school record 1,587 yards in 2014. That record will stand indefinitely, as UAB decided to shut down its football program shortly after the 2014 season.
Their school's football program being terminated left Howard with a choice. They couldn't enter the NFL Draft yet, so after being heavily recruited by top college programs, they chose to go to Indiana. While they struggled with injury in their junior season, they were a very productive runner, and was named First Team All-Big Ten along with Ezekiel Elliott. Howard chose to forgo their senior season to enter the 2016 NFL Draft.

Scouting Report
Strong vision to find holes and cutback lanes
Understands physical limitations and makes good decisions based on that
Has enough burst to get through the line at the college level, but may not translate to the pros
Will make defenders miss with short area quickness on very rare occasions
Big, and consistently displays excellent pad level to drive defenders backwards
Shows fantastic leg drive to keep moving forward after contact
Lacks top level speed and will get caught from behind
Strong as a stand-up pass blocker, locks defenders down
Did not attempt a cut block on tape
Limited athleticism limits their ability as a receiver
Film Study
This article has multiple pages, examining different traits that Howard displays, and discussing whether or not those traits bode well for their transition to the NFL game. The first three pages deal with their running traits, while the fourth page covers their work in the passing game and the last includes projections for Howard in the NFL.
In order to watch Howard, I went to Draft Breakdown, which has five of their college games.
Running Game
As a runner, Howard is a one dimensional player. Fortunately for him, the thing they do well, which is running between the tackles, is valued in the NFL. Howard consistently displays good vision and decision making throughout their running. They also show great power. However, they lack the elusiveness, burst and top end speed to really become
Vision/Decision Making
Howard often shows strong decision making skills. They can exploit small holes, cutback lanes, and set up defenders for failure. Players with good vision can consistently earn short gains in the NFL, and those gains are valuable because they keep offenses on schedule. Howard can deliver that.
The first play shows one questionable decision from Howard in terms of situational awareness. It's a run to the edge and they end up going out of bounds. The problem is that Indiana is presumably trying to run out the clock, so going out of bounds doesn't make any sense. Lack of situational awareness can cost teams games. Howard will need to keep these things in mind at the next level.
The second play is a real positive for Howard, as they show that they can fit through small holes despite being a bigger back. This is especially important for interior runners like Howard who teams are going to stack the box against. They finish the run with great pad level, a hallmark of their game.
The third play shows Howard setting up defenders with head fakes to get outside of them. They don't have great burst, so doing this will be necessary for Howard to gain positive yardage on runs to the edge at the next level.
The fourth play shows Howard recognizing and avoiding backfield penetration, and it also shows them using the blockers in front of them to press the hole and create yardage for himself. The final play shows Howard display the knowledge that they need to cut runs inside because they don't have the athletic ability to hit to the edge. Pressing outside still forces the defender to respect that threat and allows Howard to find space inside, which is a nice touch.
Burst/Acceleration
While Howard has moments of strong burst, it's not a feature that permeates their game. There were certainly times where they got into open space because of their burst, but they faced a lot of lower level competition in the games watched, and even then they clearly didn't always get great burst.
The first play is an example of where Howard fails to gain yardage that is available to them because of their issues with burst. The DE is able to shed their block and wrap Howard by their upper body. A player with better burst would have been wrapped by their lower half or been completely by the player, which would have made the tackle significantly more difficult.
The second play does show some very nice burst, where Howard gets through the line fast and is able to make a DB's angle a poor one. However, this is also against lower level college competition in Florida International.
The third play once again highlight's Howard's burst issues. It's a read option look and the defender takes the dive. However, there is a slight hesitation where the defender still has their shoulders turned toward the QB before finally committing to the inside run. This slight hesitation would have been enough to allow a player with better burst to completely blow them by, but Howard can't do that.
The fourth play shows strong burst by Howard to get past a defender in the backfield and kill an LB's angle. However, it's also against Southern Illinois, a team that couldn't hold a candle to a top college team, let alone an NFL team.
The final play shows them just barely getting the edge against Michigan State. With the slight help of a blocker, they were able to get there, but still had to ward off contact with a stiff arm. An NFL defender might be a step closer, which would significantly reduce the gain.

Barcelona are set to hold talks over a new contract with Xavi
Xavi: Barcelona midfielder is set to hold talks with the club over a new contract
Xavi's existing deal still has two years left to run, but the 32-year-old's agent has confirmed Barça have indicated their intention to hold talks over an extension.
 They are the most decorated Spanish player in history, having won the Primera Division, the Champions League, the Copa del Rey, the Spanish and the UEFA Super Cup on multiple occasions with the Catalan club and also lifted the European Championship (twice) and the World Cup in 2010 with Spain.
Xavi continues to flourish in midfield alongside Andres Iniesta and their representative Ivan Corretja is not expecting any problems in finalising a new deal.
"Last Friday the club sent us its intention to renew the contract because they want Xavi to sign a new deal, given that the current one ends in 2014," Corretja said to Esport3.
"Therefore it is normal that we begin to talk about these issues because in June it would be too late.
"We have always agreed in previous talks and there have never been problems of any kind.
"For the player it is very important to know that the club remains confident in him. Therefore I do not think there is any problem."
On Tuesday, two armed men who apparently have double-digit IQs decided to hold up a bar near Baltimore.
Here's how you know they weren't exactly Phi Beta Kappa: the bar was across the street from a police precinct station.
Sure enough, a group of Baltimore County officers had gathered at Monaghan's Pub for a retirement party for David Neral, a veteran sergeant who had worked with the department since 1988. The masked men entered the bar at roughly 5:30 p.m. According to Monaghan's owner Jack Milani, the men demanded cash from the employee at the carryout counter, then fled.
Some off-duty officers at the party chased the robbers and arrested them, according to the police department. The masked men were identified as Joseph McInnis III, 21, and Tyree McCoy, 22; they were charged with armed robbery, theft and related offenses, department spokesperson Cpl. Shawn Vinson reported.
Milani pointed out that the robbers should have known better; police in squad cars often visit the bar during their shift changes. They said that many of the officers are regular customers, adding, “It's kind of odd you would even attempt it. (Officers) are always in here. There was a decent amount of them.”
Baltimore County police officer Jennifer Peach said, "I'm sure that they weren't planning on there being a large room filled with police officers.”

They search for exploration areas of "The Old Ones", taking samples, making some tests and signing those positions on digital map.
Model is highly modular, so it can easily break into 3 different parts: COMMAND VEHICLE MODUL - it sits on 8 wheels therefore after separation it can go on its own shorter missions, has foldable/rotable arm with shovel, 4 smaller containers with trans lids (2 outside + 2 inside the cockpit) and bigger glassed interier for 2 astronauts, THE HIGHGROUND POD - it holds the spacecraft and small scooter, can also be used as a beacon and communication tower, in case of danger it turns into a turret, SMALL SPACESHIP - one pilot sits inside, used for quick dirrect connection with HQ or a trip to orbit. Set contains 3 minifigs of Techtroners.
TECHTRONERS PLOT
New set of astronauts is sent to the planet of their old ancestors from 80's and 90's having check if their old stuff (bases, vehicles and spaceships) can be reused or even rebuild, therefore their name is TECHTRONERS (basically space technicians). But as of their arrival to the planet they've discovered everything there react to design concepts and all that does not resemble those old times things (at least a bit) is destroyed or having problems with planets flora and fauna (for some strange reason they attack those that differ too much from those old design concepts). And so they have made their machines looking partially like those space sets from late 80's or early 90's to be able to work peacefully and without any kind of harassment from planet's non-human residents.
Octopuses are up to something. Cephalopods—the class of mollusks to which octopus, squid, and cuttlefish belong—are some of the most intelligent creatures on the planet, and they know it. These squishy geniuses are masterful escape artists and like to mess with humans by shooting water at aquarium light switches and even employees. Because their takeover is clearly inevitable, for this year's Cephalopod Week, we're celebrating our most adorable new overlord: the flapjack octopus.
“But it's named after a pancake!” You cry. “What could such a small, pancake creature do to me, a sentient flesh sack?” Yes, its ears are most certainly pancake-like, and yes, pancakes are a universal good. But that won't stop the flapjack octopus from swimming its way into your heart and exploding it from within—figuratively speaking.

Recently, researchers from Australia's Museums Victoria were lucky enough to get a glimpse at the elusive cutie while their research vessel, the Investigator, was on a 31-day expedition from Tasmania to the Coral Sea. Initially, reports suggested the specimen was a dumbo octopus, which, like the flapjack, has fins that resemble floppy ears. The dumbo's “ears,” however, are a bit longer—like the famous elephant from that goddamn depressing Disney movie.
Though flapjacks are frequently found in ocean trawls, we cephalopod enthusiasts rarely get a good look at them, since they live on the deep sea floor.
“In Australian waters we have two known species of flapjack octopod that occur in deep water around the southern coast,” Julian Finn, Museums Victoria's senior curator of marine invertebrates, told Gizmodo. “Previously these octopods were reported to occur down to depths of 1100 meters. The featured specimen, collected on the recent Investigator survey, was collected from water 2750 metres deep!”

According to Finn, flapjacks (Opisthoteuthis californiana) are predators that mainly consume crustaceans (mysids, copepods, and crangonid shrimps) and nightmare creatures called polychaete worms. They have been found flapping their tiny flippers off the coast of California and Japan.
While their fins get the most attention for obvious reasons, flapjacks have other cool features, too. “Unlike most other octopods (that have two rows of suckers on each arm), finned octopods have only a single row of suckers on each arm,” Finn explained. “This row of suckers is bordered on each side by a row of finger-like projections, called ‘cirri'. It is these cirri that the octopod reportedly uses to sense prey buried in the mud.”
Museum Victoria's recent survey collected specimens, including this flapjack, from much greater depths than its previous dives. “It is quite likely that the haul of finned octopods (including this specimen) will include new species or at least species not previously reported from Australian waters,” Finn said.

Hopefully, our adorable new despots will have mercy on us. I welcome their squishy rule.
The number of developers in China contributing to iOS and the App Store has grown by 70 percent over the past year to more than half a million, Apple revealed on its fiscal Q3 earnings conference call on Tuesday. That's almost twice as many as the 275,000 iOS developers registered with Apple in the US.
While Apple has been on a tear in China in recent years, the company's revenue in the region during the June quarter was down a surprising 43 percent sequentially and 14 percent year-over-year. Apple CEO Tim Cook noted on the call that Hong Kong had contributed to the drag, as sell-through in mainland China was up 5 percent year-over-year after accounting for inventory changes. They also said the current state of China's economy has posed difficulties for Apple and its competitors.
Cook did, however, try to put into perspective that Q3 revenue of $4.6 billion was still a strong showing compared to a few years ago, when it was just in the hundreds of millions.
Looking ahead, Apple plans to double the number of retail stores it has in Greater China over the next two years.

The new border fence, such as this section north of the resort town of Eilat, is the most tangible sign of Israel's growing unease about the upheaval in Egypt. (Joel Greenberg/The Washington Post)
A short drive north from this Red Sea resort town, a new reality is taking shape along Israel's desert border with Egypt. A lonely frontier road flanked by a low, rusting fence is buzzing with earth-moving equipment and workmen erecting an imposing steel barrier encased in razor wire that is gradually snaking across the desolate landscape.
The new border fence, about 15 feet high, is the most tangible sign of Israel's growing unease about the upheaval in Egypt, which has aggravated shaky security conditions in the Sinai Peninsula bordering Israel. Israeli concerns were heightened in August when gunmen who crossed from Sinai struck on the border road north of Eilat, leaving eight Israelis dead.
That attack led to the acceleration of work on the border fence, which, when complete, will run about 140 miles from Israel's border with the Gaza Strip south to the Eilat area. Originally intended as an obstacle to the thousands of African migrants and asylum seekers who sneak across the frontier annually, the barrier is increasingly seen as a bulwark against security threats emanating from Sinai.
But the rising fence is also a metaphor for how Israel sees itself in a changing Middle East: Beset on all sides by profound shifts in its Arab neighbors that could alter the strategic balance in the region, it is bolstering its defenses and preparing for the worst.
Lawlessness in the Sinai Peninsula, where local Bedouin tribes have long complained of neglect by the Egyptian authorities, has increased since Egypt's revolution early this year. Attackers have targeted police posts and repeatedly blown up a natural gas pipeline supplying Israel, leading the government to dispatch additional security forces to the region.
Israeli officials say members of radical Islamic groups and Palestinian militants from the Gaza Strip are seeking to use Sinai as a platform for attacks on Israel. Some have cautioned that the political turmoil in Egypt, and the possible emergence of a government with a strong Islamist element, could threaten the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty. The pact has kept the border calm and is seen as a key element of Israel's security.
Matan Vilnai, the Israeli minister for civil defense and a retired general, said in an interview with Israeli Army Radio last week that they expected a “serious erosion” of the peace treaty with Egypt when its new political leadership emerges. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been more circumspect, declaring that preserving the treaty remains an interest of both Israel and Egypt, regardless of what government emerges there.
For now, the border remains relatively quiet but potentially volatile. Bedouin smugglers and illegal migrants continue to cross the still-porous frontier, and beefed-up Israeli forces are on alert for infiltration by gunmen seeking to attack inside Israel. The smugglers move arms, drugs and other contraband, while the migrants from countries such as Eritrea and Sudan make the risky crossing to seek a livelihood and asylum in Israel.
On Nov. 23, two Egyptian border guards were killed in a shootout with smugglers, according to the Israeli army and news media reports from Egypt. About an hour later, Israeli soldiers shot at a group of smugglers who had crossed into Israel, drawing return fire from the infiltrators, who left behind an assault rifle and a pistol, according to the military.
Events at the border can have a powerful ripple effect. After the deadly attack in August, Israeli forces pursuing the gunmen killed five Egyptian security officers, triggering a furious reaction in Egypt that shook bilateral relations and fueled protests that climaxed three weeks later with the storming of the Israeli Embassy in Cairo.
The area where the attack occurred was eerily quiet during an army-escorted visit by journalists on a recent afternoon. The Israeli border road, closed to civilian traffic since the incident, was empty. Across the new border fence, a group of off-duty Egyptian police officers trooped out of their hilltop post for an impromptu soccer game in the gully below.
Swathed in coils of razor wire, the barrier was angled at its top toward Egyptian territory to discourage attempts to scale it. Sections of the old ramshackle fence were visible in the rocky terrain, separated by gaps that have made it easily passable.
An Israeli surveillance blimp floated in the distance, a sign of the stepped-up intelligence-gathering effort in the border area, coupled with a substantial increase and upgrade of troops at the frontier. The new fence is to be backed by cameras and radar to detect movements on the Egyptian side.
Built to serve as a formidable obstacle rather than as an electronic tripwire to signal infiltration, the Egypt border fence is a larger construction than Israel's security fence around the Gaza Strip. Located in a barren strip of land along a mutually agreed border, it has not generated the controversies and legal challenges triggered by Israel's separation barrier in the West Bank, which slices into the territory, runs through Palestinian communities in some places and cuts villages off from their lands in others.
A senior officer on the border with Egypt said that despite the increase in perceived threats there, the army still views the area differently from the hostile frontiers with the Gaza Strip, Syria and Lebanon, from which rockets were fired across Israel's northern border Tuesday, drawing Israeli artillery fire. The rules of engagement along the Egyptian border were different, the officer said, but they acknowledged that since the August attack, military activity along the borderline is carried out with greater tactical caution and more potential firepower.
“We're more alert, more prepared, but we still rely on the Egyptians to do the job in their sector,” said the officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of army rules. “We can't prevent shooting from the other side, but we want to prevent infiltration by terrorists into our territory and attacks inside Israel.”
The $360 million fence project is slated for completion toward the end of next year, and there are plans to reopen the border area soon to Israeli motorists and hikers. Despite the changes sweeping Egypt, coordination with the Egyptian security forces in the field is continuing, the officer said.
“It's still a border of peace,” they said. “Our interest is to keep it that way.”
The Audi 2017 MLS Cup Playoffs Conference Championships are set. After four two-leg aggregate-goal series reached their conclusion, Columbus, Houston, Seattle and Toronto have advanced out of their semifinal matchups.
The Seattle Sounders face the Houston Dynamo for the second time in the postseason, with this year's winner advancing to MLS Cup.
Seattle will be hoping to reach MLS Cup as they look to win back-to-back Philip F. Anschutz trophies. The big difference this time will be that they will have Clint Dempsey on the field and healthy, as the former US national team captain missed last year's run due to an irregular heartbeat. Osvaldo Alonso should be available as well while Jordan Morris could make their long-awaited return after sustaining a hamstring injury in September.
The Dynamo return to the Conference Championship round for the first time since 2013, when they were beaten by Sporting Kansas City in the Eastern Conference Championship. That came after reaching two straight MLS Cups in 2011 and 2012, losing to the LA Galaxy both times. Houston have won two MLS Cups as they came in back-to-back years in 2006 and 2007.
All-Time:
Seattle 6 wins (19 goals) ... Houston 4 wins (16 goals) ... Draws 6
In SEA: Seattle 6 wins (11 goals) ... Houston 0 wins (2 goals) ... Draws 2
Seattle 6 wins (11 goals) ... Houston 0 wins (2 goals) ... Draws 2 In HOU: Houston 4 wins (14 goals) ... Seattle 0 wins (8 goals) ... Draws 4

When all hope is lost, leave it to others on the Web to reach out and help. One such example is a garbled letter left behind by a late grandmother, now decoded by other Internet users.
Here is another: a man is assaulted by an officer, trumped up charges are laid, they are jailed for 10 days and their phone is taken. When they get it back, the footage has clearly been tampered with, leaving nothing but their word against an officer, a pending one-year jail term, a claim that there was no police call and deleted, corrupted files.
The video's owner has uploaded more recovered videos including one that recorded their 9-1-1 call. They attribute Reddit user rolls20s for saving them from jail and leaves this YouTube description asking for more help to recover files:
Corrupt Video just recovered, more videos still to repair after in police custody for a false violation!
After just calling 911, A police car drives by me even though I'm flagging it down on a narrow road, they drive right past me. I approach the police car wait next to it, obviously indicated that I'm waiting to speak to the officer. INSTEAD the officer approaches me and attacks. Charges me with obstruction of governmental administration a misdemeanor. Penalty 1 year jail. The data on the phone was corrupt and shows signs of tampering and erased data.
Someone online was able to recover one corrupt video. Working on the other parts where I'm screaming in pain and it gets much worse. The dashcam video they clam was not in the police car at the time, and records of the 911 call have been unable to obtain, yet I have one 🙂 Infact any documents have been hard to obtain. My lawyers name is G____. I just got this phone back friday after much anguish. There is even more to recover. If you would like to help recover the other files feel free to download them here. https://mega.co.nz/#F!cFNT1IIb!F_ILHh… This event happened the 18th. of july 2013 The officer is still working, and I have a very nice picture of them to help others say clear of a similar situation.

Seva Mandir—An NGO in northern India—has invited us to pilot our technology with them, and we need your support to make it happen.
Featured by NPR, Yale News, Product Hunt, and the editorial team at Storehouse!
THE PROBLEM
Community health workers walk door-to-door for hours each day, reminding mothers about upcoming vaccination clinics. Despite this hard work, millions of children never complete their basic vaccinations. When we visited Northern India, we found three major systemic problems.
We've built an inexpensive digital necklace and an accompanying mobile app that streamline the process of vaccinating children in the developing world.
Khushi means happiness in Hindi. With Khushi Baby, children can wear their entire vaccination record. All the data is stored on a tiny near-field communication chip that can be accessed without an internet connection. It's durable, battery-free, and costs less than a dollar.
We chose to build a necklace because when we visited northern India, we noticed that most babies had necklaces already. They're commonly worn to bring good health and fortune.
Here's how it works:
Over the summer, we visited India and tested our product alongside local health workers. They gave us their support. Now we just need yours.
Our system addresses all three of the challenges listed above:
1. We send automated voice calls to mothers, which stress the importance of vaccinations and alert them of where and when to get their children vaccinated.
2. We help healthcare workers track which babies need which vaccines each day, so they can bring enough supplies to clinic.
3. We provide NGOs with rich data that helps them maximize the success of their immunization programs.
OUR TEAM
We met earlier this year in a class at Yale called Appropriate Technology for the Developing World. Our team was challenged to work on a project that would improve vaccination rates. But Khushi Baby outlasted the semester. In April, we won the Thorne Prize for Social Innovation in Health (sponsored by InnovateHealth Yale) which made our project a reality.
Now our team has expanded to include other talented members of the Yale community and beyond. Seva Mandir—a reputable NGO in Northern India with over 45 years of experience in grassroots development—invited us to run a pilot program in their immunization program early next year. Researchers at the Indian Institute of Health Management Research are also collaborating on the pilot. We're all committed to making Khushi Baby succeed beyond the classroom.

WHY PLEDGE?
This is about more than just access to vaccines. It's about giving health workers the data they need to improve their treatment programs. We want Khushi Baby to be a sustainable venture, but our first step is running this pilot in northern India. By making medical history wearable, we can bridge the gap between providers and patients in a truly impactful way.
We've done the calculations, and we need $25,000 to get our pilot off the ground. This includes technological development, travel expenses to Rajasthan, local research support, and basic material costs.

The online reviews for Dallas' Doll House Massage Parlor are heavy on acronyms. Once you decode things, you end up finding stuff out you probably could've gone without knowing. The Doll House, according to those reviews and the U.S. Department of Justice, was offering out more than just rubdowns.
Late last week, Connie Su Moser (also known as Song Ye Hong), 63, and Kum Shugars, 67, were arrested by members of the North Texas Trafficking Taskforce for sex trafficking and using facilities of interstate commerce to promote prostitution at the massage parlor/brothel. According to the DOJ, Moser owns the Doll House and Shugars is one of its managers.
Members of the forum at massageplanet.net describe Moser's parlor, located at the corner of Irving Boulevard and Sharp Street, as "[looking] like a dump on the outside but very nice on the inside." Services rendered, according to the anonymous reviewers, are indistinguishable from what one might expect at a brothel that wasn't pretending to be something else.

I have to say I really enjoyed the simplicity of the smallest Windows program possible. I also enjoyed making it better, which included making it more of a C++ program and less of a C one. I also covered a little Direct2D, a little COM, and a little "here's some other stuff you're going to want to read." If it's been ages since you wrote a Windows program in C++, or wrote one that wasn't all covered in barnacles from frameworks and libraries you might not want to rely on for simple things, I really suggest you give this series a read - it won't take long and you can use Visual C++ Express if you like - the first chapter includes links and instructions for getting all the tools you need.

Arma 3 's alpha is just over a week old, but a few promising add-ons are already taking advantage of Bohemia's out-the-gate moddability. An inevitable carryover from the hardcore Arma 2 community is ACRE , or Advanced Combat Radio Environment, a mod-turned-mainstay for the majority of players for its realistic voice-comm behavior influenced by range, direction, terrain, and facing. It's as certain to appear in Arma 3 as scores of DayZ knockoffs, and this video shows off an already working early prototype in multiplayer.
Jump forward to around the 1:10 mark for some examples of ACRE's range-limiting and directional capabilities for voice chat. Arma veterans like Dslyecxi swear by it. "Terrain can influence it," they told us in an interview last year. "If you're in a forest it'll cause it to show shorter ranges. If you're moving away, their radio is having more trouble reaching you, they'll actually hear you distort and break up and eventually you'll lose them entirely."
For me, the added mechanics ACRE provides serves as yet another reason to fully jump into the Arma series' golden moments of teamwork and communication. I'd also like to see similar options for realistic comms in other military multiplayer shooters. Having the game environment affect how well a team trades messages would give a nice boost in immersion, not to mention tactics—the distance drop-off for voice could deliver impromptu ambushes and revealing eavesdrops.
Evan's gone full-tilt on covering Arma 3's alpha, and you can find plenty of info on the game through their videos and hands-on preview .

Unite the Union, the trade union representing cabin crew employees of British Airways, has said it will continue to strike through the summer if it cannot reach an agreement with the airline over pay and benefits. Unite's twelve-week legal protective period ends next week, requiring the union to re-ballot its members and pass another strike resolution in order to continue the industrial action. The Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) tried to schedule new talks between officials of British Airways and Unite the Union, but as yet, it is unsuccessful. Tom Woodley of Unite, said recently, “We will stand up to BA bullies – even if it means another strike.”
The Daily Mail reported earlier this month that Unite the Union is “losing support among the public and its own membership.” Nevertheless, the multinational trade union remains the largest in the United Kingdom. It was founded in 2007 with the merger of Amicus the Union and the Transport and General Workers' Union. British Airways was formed in 1974 with the merger of the British Overseas Airways Corporation and British European Airways. It is the United Kingdom's highest-profile airline, and is headquartered very near its main hub Heathrow Airport (IATA: LHR; ICAO: EGLL) in the London borough of Hillingdon.

OTTAWA Why is the federal government spying on Cindy Blackstock?
Since 2007, federal officials have attended 75 to 100 meetings at which Cindy Blackstock spoke, then reported back to their bosses. ( Pawel Dwulit / Toronto Star file photo )
When does a life-long advocate for aboriginal children become an enemy of the state? The answer, it would seem, is when you file a human rights complaint accusing your government of willfully underfunding child welfare services to First Nations children on reserves. Accusing your government, in other words, of racial discrimination.

That's what Blackstock, as executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, did in 2007. Since that time, federal officials attended 75 to 100 meetings at which they spoke, then reported back to their bosses. They went on their Facebook page during work hours, then assigned a bureaucrat to sign on as themselves after hours to check it again looking for testimony from the tribunal. On at least two occasions, they pulled their Status Indian file and its personal information, including data on their family. As first reported by the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, it's all there in a mountain of documents, measuring more than six inches high, which they recently received after waiting 1 ½ years for them to be released under access to information legislation.
“I have never had a parking ticket, let alone a criminal record and I have never conducted myself in an unprofessional manner,'' they told me from Edmonton Tuesday. Some of the emailed reports that went up the ladder at the former Indian and Northern Affairs openly mocked Blackstock.

In one report of their presentation to a New Brunswick symposium, there was a sarcastic summary of their “tour de force . . . which fired up a ready to be impressed audience. “She rattled through some general statistics (or gave the impression of doing so) before being whisked off to the airport.'' It's hardly the first time that the Conservative government has surreptitiously kept its eyes on aboriginals. Last month, it was revealed the Canadian military had been keeping watch on activities of native organizations and had delivered at least eight reports over 18 months dealing with everything from a potential native backlash over Ontario's introduction of the HST to potential demonstrations on the lawn of Parliament Hill. In 2009, Blackstock was awarded the Atkinson Charitable Foundation's Economic Justice fellowship, which provides $100,000 per year to community leaders to support their work. Among those who praised them on that occasion was former prime minister Paul Martin. In April, they spoke at a two-day provincial summit organized by the Dalton McGuinty government to try to find common ground among those fighting to improve the lives of native kids. So, while one level of government was seeking their expertise, another level was spying on them A spokesperson for Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Duncan, said the government “takes privacy concerns very seriously. The department routinely monitors and analyses the public environment as it relates to the department's policies, programs, services and initiatives. This is done to do a better job in service delivery and policy.'' Blackstock decided to seek their own file after they were denied access to a 2009 meeting with departmental officials on behalf of Ontario chiefs. Instead, they were made to wait in an anteroom, where they were watched by a burly security guard who towered above them “I have never said anything that the auditor general hasn't said,'' Blackstock says. Indeed, in 2008, then-auditor general Sheila Fraser confirmed that substantial shortfalls in federal child-welfare funding on reserves are jeopardizing children's safety. Fraser also found First Nations children receive substantially less elementary and secondary school funding per capita than other Canadians enjoy. “I'm a common sense girl,'' Blackstock says. “I say rather than spend the money following me around, spend it on the children.'' This is a government that seems perpetually in need of enemies. The irony is that there has been much speculation in this city of late that the plight of aboriginals will be a major preoccupation of Stephen Harper in the remaining years of their majority government. A first step would be to stop treating advocates for aboriginals as enemies.
iTunes 8 has added simple under-the-radar feature that allows you to quickly and easily tag any file in your iTunes library as an audiobook and move it into the Audiobooks section of iTunes and your iPod. The simple trick? Just right-click a track and select Get Info, head to the Options tab, and then select Audiobook from the Media Kind drop-down menu. The file will instantly leave your Music library and head straight for your Audiobook library. To mark multiple files at once, just select them all and go through the same process. The only remaining step is to tick the Remember Position checkbox if you haven't already, and your tracks should now have easily found their way to your Audiobooks section, and even better, they should work like an audiobook. Finally. Thanks Brett!

The Wire was an HBO original series written by David Simon – of Homicide: Life on the Street, Generation Kill,and Treme fame. The show originally aired from 2002 – 2008 and starred Dominic West, Idris Elba, Michael K. Williams, and Wood Harris (Julius Campbell from Remember the Titans), among others. The fictional story follows the Baltimore P.D. and their “criminal” counterparts from the West and East ends of B'More.
Obviously, you could have read all of that from Wikipedia. What could I possibly say about a show that ended 6 years ago? A show which has a 9.4 rating on IMDB and is only outranked by Breaking Bad, Planet Earth, andGame of Thrones. A show so popular it was referenced in How I Met Your Mother and iCarly.
real . Not in the sense of non-fiction, or that it's “based upon a true story.” It is real because it speaks to the heart concerning our existence in the world. It's phenomenological in the sense that it suspends the natural attitude, the way we approach reality in our everyday existence with all our prejudices. The show brackets these perceptions/judgments and puts in front our faces a harsh, filthy, and rugged world we each encounter. The show clears the way for us to truly see the life of our neighbor.There is no sugarcoating in The Wire. It does not play upon an archetypal/structuralist worldview where police are good and criminals are bad. Police, criminals, addicts, sponsors, stevedores, politicians, teachers, students, parents…everyone in the world of The Wire lives a particular existence. A show which left me feeling empty after watching the series finale.What is it about this show that's still worth talking about? Is there anything that can be said that has not been said already?

It does not play upon an archetypal/structuralist worldview where police are good and criminals are bad. Police, criminals, addicts, sponsors, stevedores, politicians, teachers, students, parents…everyone in the world of The Wire lives a particular existence. For example:
Det. Jimmy McNulty
When we first meet McNulty, he's interviewing a kid on the curb about a recent murder. Their dialogue centers around the deceased's nickname and is semi-comical for the gravity of the situation. From this first encounter with McNulty, we get the sense that they are a detective who 1) is street smart and 2) loves their job. McNulty is not a black and white moralist detective; a cookie-cutter detective who is an upstanding police officer. Nor do they see being a detective merely a job. McNulty lives their badge – with its faults, failings, shortcomings, praises, and accomplishments. McNulty lives their being-a-detective in such a way that it becomes a “fault” in many circumstances. They do some rather despicable things to find loopholes and exploit the justice system. Nevertheless, McNulty is a Dasein who brings meaning to their world, i.e. always looking for the perfect case. They project themselves into their future possibilities with all the concerns those possibilities entail, all in the name of being “real police.” Yet in living their “detectiveness,” McNulty loses themselves in the “they” of “real police.”  They are so concerned with finding the perfect case that they lack concern for those closest to him. They destroy (leaps-in) the relationships they have with family, friends, and colleagues; all for their pursuit of being a “real police.” In watching McNulty throughout the show, one quickly realizes that the preconceived idea that all police are “good” is an outright lie. Jimmy is “good” at being a detective but bad in living as a detective. But he's not the only person in The Wire who shows us another perspective of being-in-the-world.
Bubbles
Bubbles is a heroin addict played by Andre Royo. Besides the Season 4 story-arc, Bubs's story may be the most tragic of the entire show. Through Royo's character, we see the often overlooked, ignored, mistreated, cursed, dehumanizing life that addicts live. The beauty of David Simon's writing is that they quickly but subtly pulls us from our moral high horse and prompts us to examine our own existence. Bubbles is possibly the most genuine of all the characters in the show and they demonstrate this by the way they are able to be-with the people of the streets. If most of us are guilty of leaping-in the existence of another, Bubbles demonstrates how to leap-ahead of the other; allowing them to develop their own projections without appropriating them for our own use, as if they are a piece of equipment. Yet, even Bubs have their numerous faults. The first is their obvious addiction. The show provides periodic comedic relief with Bubbles's subplot, often showing them do ridiculous things in order to feed their addiction. Nevertheless, Bubs recognizes this fault and does not run from it nor do they pretend it's something else. They know they are an addict and is accepting of this situation. As much as I'd like to discuss the particularities of Bubbles, it would be hard to do so without giving numerous spoilers. (I do realize this show ended a long time ago and there's really no need to provide a spoiler alert. However, part of the enjoyment of watching this series knew relatively nothing about it so I hope to preserve some of that unknown.) Suffice it to say that Bubbles is a person who could easily be ignored but in talking to him, people come to see the façade they often erect for their lives.
Omar
Omar Little is a very dynamic character. If you're societal constructs hadn't been destroyed already, the introduction of Omar completes that destruction. Omar is a stick-up gangster who robs the feuding gangs of Baltimore without prejudice. At various points throughout the show, I found myself rooting for Omar's success. In my second time watching the show – this time with my wife – they did the same thing. One night we were discussing an episode and I asked her, “Why is it that we cheer on Omar, a gangster who walks the streets of East/West Baltimore with a shotgun and kevlar vest? If we saw someone like that on our street, we'd do like everyone in the show…we'd run.” Again, this points to the brilliance of the show and how well developed these characters are. Objectively speaking, there is no reason why one should hope for Omar's success. He's a thief and a criminal; yet, Omar destroys our prejudiced view as to what constitutes a criminal. He's a criminal with a moral guideline (refusing to swear or hurt innocents), he's tender (takes their grandmother to church on Sunday) and sometimes contrary to the overly masculine idea of a street criminal. I believe the reason we root for “social outcasts” like Bubbles and Omar is that they're presented as real people. They are not dehumanized as social burdens (conservative view) nor are they idolized as the cause for social justice (liberal view). They are just people trying to live authentically as possible in a world that does not give meaning to them. They have to find that meaning for themselves.
At the end of the series, we're left wondering, who are the good guys? The police? The politicians? And the bad guys? The criminals?
The answer: We are…We're as good as we leap-ahead of our neighbors. Do we see the other's world the way they see it? Do we erect social constructs which are more hostile than protective? While the show may involve the modern political system, life is more than a political matter. Life is something worth living, but living authentically. Who lives with greater authenticity, the addict who accepts their addiction and tries to overcome it, or the journalist who tries to cheat the system for a Pulitzer? The Police Chief who jukes the stats for a career push or the gangster who uses their earnings to begin property investment?
Only by bracketing our preconceived ideas are we able to see the other's life-world as they live it; all of it…the good and the bad.
Washington (CNN) Conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch appears is a fan of retired neurosurgeon and presidential contender Ben Carson.
The founder and chairperson of the News Corp. media conglomerate tweeted Wednesday that Ben Carson's surge in the latest Iowa poll shows that America is a "land of hope versus fear."
"The Latest Iowa poll has Carson level with Trump. America land of hope versus fear," Murdoch tweeted, referring to a Monmouth University poll released Tuesday that showed Carson tying GOP frontrunner Donald Trump at 23%.
Latest Iowa poll has Carson level with Trump. America land of hope versus fear. — Rupert Murdoch (@rupertmurdoch) September 2, 2015
That tweet came two days after Murdoch also tweeted that Carson's surging poll numbers reveal that "character DOES count. Their life story should make every American optimistic."

Well Christmas has come and gone and New Years is a few days away. This week is affectionately known as Gaper Week by most of the locals because its the week when all the kids are out of school and there are tons of tourists at the resorts. It's OK to laugh at the Gapers just dont taunt them or feed them people food. Seriously (not really) though its not that big of deal.. most of the Gapers are just folks who dont get the pleasure of either living in a snow town or being on the hill for dozens and dozens of days a season like the rest of us. For this reason they dont understand how silly, ridiculous, and/or annoying they can sometimes be so Im here to give them all a few pointers….
First things first … NO FUCKING THEME HATS no fake dreadlocks, jester hats, fake mohawk beanies, viking horns none of that .. just stop it now
Dads … Dont be jerks to your 5 years olds. Avoid any run with names like WidowMaker, Over The Edge, Niagara Falls, Lemmings Leap, Deaths Door, etc etc … your kid is five cut them some slack and get to the beginner runs
No expert park ever .. not even to look .. just stay out
Blue Jeans and your local college teams Starter Jacket do not make appropriate mountain wear. I understand gear is expensive but buy you some basic gear and it will last you 5 years or longer and you will be much more comfortable.
Moms… especially Southern Moms… theres no need for full make-up, jewelry, and perfume on the mountain .. seriously WTF
If you are in a group of 2 or more do not get into the lift line until your entire group is ready … dont get to the chair then turn around and look for your homies who are a dozen people back
If you are going down a run and theres a group of trees its ok for your group to go on opposite sides of the trees. Believe it or not you will meet up again on the other side. No need to panic, no screaming needed, and no walking back up hill for someone to get on the “right” side of the trees….
Maps are helpful for many non locals.. take the opportunity to look at them on the lift and decide where your group will meet… dont wait until you get off the lift to pile up and try to figure out where you are going
You know that sign that says “do not stop here keep moving” … dont use that for balance as you strap in to your board.. dont stop there .. keep moving
You know that big field of pow that no one has hit on that epic pow day of your trip … well its untracked for a reason .. stay out It's either too deep and youll get stuck, full of rocks, or worst case scenario… a lake
Speaking of epic pow days… you should have anticipated them when you went cheap at the car rental place and got the mazda compact instead of the 4×4 … stay out of the canyon with your rear-wheel drive death trap
Hey I'm here for your support while you visit my home mountain. If you have any questions or need directions I'm happy to help but my support has its end. The end of my support is when we get off the lift… please stop struggling to stand upright and grabbing at me for support. If you're just learning maybe the big boy lift wasn't the best option for you today… look we all fall from time to time even someone like me who's ridden for over a decade. My point is if you're going down stop trying to take me with you like a drowning swimmer who kills theirs would be rescuer … also fyi holding onto the chair isn't the best option either.
No back country for you … just saying

Media dictates so much in today's world -- including relationships.
Whether portraying unrequited love, forbidden love or passionate love, the media's ideas of love all have something in common: drama.
After all, drama drives the media.
But, guess what? When you're in a dramatic relationship, this reality isn't so appealing. Dramatic relationships are just plain sh*tty, and there's nothing romantic or alluring about that.
Real relationships, to be quite honest, could almost be considered boring, and the media doesn't value "boring."
For years, I bought into the idea that a relationship needed some type of drama to be legitimized. As I'm settling down, I'm realizing how truly wrong and exhausting that mentality was.
For the first time in... well, ever, I'm in a healthy, mature relationship. It's different than previous relationships I've had because this one is real. It is solid. It is stable. It is everything I've ever wanted, and everything I didn't know I needed.
It's also everything I ran away from in the past because it just seemed too "boring." Only now am I realizing that there is a difference between a boring relationship and a stable, mature one.
1. Being your significant other's partner isn't hard.
Until recently, I always struggled when I was in a relationship. Feelings of uncertainty and anxiety were overwhelmingly normal, while feeling secure in the relationship was not.
Maybe this is obvious, but it shouldn't be the case. Being someone's partner should come easily rather than feel like a chore or a responsibility.
2. You don't have to be in contact 24/7.
Part of an adult relationship is realizing that each person has their or their own world, separate of one another. This means that being together all the time or constantly texting just isn't feasible, and that is OK.
Actually, it's even nice. I love my boyfriend, but if I talked to them constantly, I'd go crazy.
3. You don't want to change your significant other.
I'll admit that I have a history of seeking out broken people and trying to fix them, which never ends well. This isn't the case in a healthy relationship.
In a healthy relationship, changing your partner shouldn't even be a desire on your radar. Changing annoying little habits is one thing, but changing or fixing who someone is as a person should not be your goal. Maybe they or they aren't perfect, but they or they shouldn't have to be.
4. Your significant other balances you out -- and even calls you out.
Rather than always agreeing on every aspect of life, your relationship tests and challenges your views. Your partner brings new views to light -- possibly ideas that oppose your own.
When you don't agree on a topic, it isn't the end of the world. You acknowledge each other's positions and move on.
5. Discussing the future isn't scary.
In immature relationships, there is less certainty and less communication about the status of the relationship, therefore less willingness to discuss the future.
In an adult relationship, plans can be made months in advance without stopping to wonder where the relationship will or won't be.
6. You may disagree, but you don't all-out fight.
Observing how the other person argues and adjusting your own style is a learning process, but part of a mature relationship. For example, I tend to shut down when I am angry, whereas my boyfriend is more direct.
Adjusting to this was difficult at first, but now that we know each other's style of disagreement, we are able to communicate in a more mature manner.
7. Showing your love becomes more important than verbally expressing it.
It used to irritate me that I am more vocal about telling my boyfriend I love him. He, on the other hand, doesn't say it as often, but shows it in their actions.
Over time, I've realized that this is preferable to hearing it all the time. Sometimes love is in the day-to-day actions rather than the literal words, and this is definitely a more mature viewpoint.
8. Jealousy is a non-issue because the relationship is founded on trust.
In an adult relationship, the male can have female friends and vice-versa without the world coming to a screeching halt. Each partner is secure in the other's commitment and does not possess an unfounded worry about cheating or dishonesty.
9. You're in sync with one another -- mentally and physically.
This may sound like it's about sex, but it is not the case. It's more about knowing a person so well and having developed such a connection that their or their smallest movement can be predicted -- or sentences finished. It's about them or them becoming an extension of you in a healthy way.
ALSO ON HUFFPOST:
Prof David Haslam, chairperson of Nice, says the British should be more like Americans, who tend to be less deferential
British patients should adopt more "pushy" American attitudes with their doctors to get drugs they are entitled to, the head of the NHS rationing body has said.
Prof David Haslam, chairperson of the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice), said that patients need to see themselves as "equal partners" with doctors to get the treatment they need.
And they explained that after working as a doctor near an US air force base in Cambridgeshire, they noticed that American patients had a less deferential approach than local residents.
"Americans tended to want to know more about their treatment than the British who tend to be much more 'thank you doctor, I will take that'," they told the Daily Telegraph.
Earlier this week a government report found that a third of patients with kidney cancer and one in three motor neurone disease sufferers are not receiving the drugs they need.
Health experts warned that the research by the Health and Social Care Information Centre had exposed an "endemic and disastrous postcode lottery" of care within the health service.
Prof Haslam said an investigation was under way to uncover why so many patients are not being prescribed medications .
But they explained that patients should demand the drugs they need and only be refused Nice-approved drugs if they are unsuitable
They said that, although they were not suggesting that patients should be confrontational, they wanted them to tell doctors if they think they are missing out on treatments which could help them.
They said: "When products have been approved for use by the NHS by Nice, patients have a legal right to those drugs – as long as they are clinically appropriate. The take-up should be much higher than it currently is."
The former GP also urged people to have a better understanding of the drugs they are taking or might be able to take, allowing them to work better with their doctor.
They added that it was "essential for the future of the health service and the future health of the nation" for patients to understand their conditions and treatments.
Youngstown police are investigating the Sunday morning shooting death at an East Side bar.
Detectives tell 21 News that just after 2 a.m., 21-year-old Ezequiel Rivera was shot several times at the Mi Raza bar on Oak Street.
Witnesses told police that Rivera had gotten into a fight at the bar and was asked to leave. They returned about five minutes later with a shot gun. Detectives believe, Rivera thought the person they had been fighting was still at the bar.
According to detectives, employees told Rivera several times to put the gun down. Rivera fired one round through the ceiling. Detectives say, an employee with a concealed carry permit then fired several rounds. Rivera was hit in the chest. Detectives aren't sure how many times they were struck. An autopsy is scheduled for Tuesday.
Detectives say, Rivera's brother-in-law was also shot. They believe they became caught in the cross fire when they tried to stop Rivera from going back into the bar. Detectives say Rivera's brother-in-law was outside the bar but, a bullet went through the window. They say, they are in stable condition.
Police are reviewing surveillance video and will talk with the prosecutor to determine if any charges will be filed.
Hate groups of all stripes used their websites to advertise their participation in the rally. They turned to social media to urge their followers to join them. And they used services like PayPal and Patreon to fund their invasion of Charlottesville, Virginia.
Such partnerships may soon be a thing of the past. By Monday morning, service providers had begun to pull the plug on hate groups and individual extremists alike.
“I woke up this morning in a bad mood and decided to kick them off the internet,” Cloudflare Chief Executive Matthew Prince wrote in an email to employees announcing their suspension of the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer.
The Daily Stormer became the top hate site in America last year, but it struggled to stay online this week after its long-time host, GoDaddy, delisted its domain on Monday. Over the course of the week, The Daily Stormer transferred its registration to Google and even to the Russian Network Information Center, only to be kicked off each provider.
“Charlottesville has definitely lit a fire under some people,” SPLC Intelligence Project Director Heidi Beirich told USA Today. “I wonder if the violence marks a sea change.”
Beirich is right that tech companies have been stubbornly hands-off in the past. Despite policies that are ostensibly “anti-hate,” they have rarely taken action to remove hateful content or users from their platforms.
But as the nation grapples with the violent coordination of hate groups across the far-right spectrum in Charlottesville, Facebook has shut down at least nine pages connected to the rally; Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn have suspended several extremist accounts; Reddit has eliminated one discussion community that supported “Unite the Right,” and even OKCupid has kicked white nationalist Christopher Cantwell off the dating site.
By far, the biggest sweep came from PayPal, which agreed to block at least 34 organizations from using its services after an SPLC report highlighted how extremists used the platform to fund the rally in Charlottesville.
“For the longest time, PayPal has essentially been the banking system for white nationalism,” the SPLC's Keegan Hankes told The Washington Post. “It's a shame it took Charlottesville for them to take it seriously.”
It is good news that PayPal, Pateron, and other tech companies are finally taking steps to curb the hate on their platforms. But to truly make a dent in the hate and bigotry online, tech companies must be more cognizant of the role their services play in spreading hate.
“If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention,” Heather Heyer, 32, posted on Facebook before they were killed by an alleged Nazi sympathizer in Charlottesville.
It's wise advice for tech firms in Silicon Valley and beyond.

"Hi! I'm actor Melissa McCarthy! You may remember me from Bridesmaids, or recent US hit Identity Thief! I'm here to tell you all about a new weight loss programme called The Shitty Photoshop Diet! It couldn't be easier!"
Follow us on Twitter @The_Shiznit for more fun features, film reviews and occasional commentary on what the best type of crisps are.
Without wanting to sound insensitive, Melissa McCarthy is I guess what you'd call a "larger lady" – certainly by Hollywood standards, anyway. She's a big girl. And obviously that's fine. She's built a very strong career off the back of being a bit bigger than your average LA rake. It would be nice if their weight was not an issue, but then that's not the world we live in.This poster for McCarthy's forthcoming comedyfrom Bridesmaids director Paul Feig, however, is something fucking else. Nobody is unclear what Melissa McCarthy's body size is – she's plus-sized and proud. So why have the designers of this poster done their utmost to Photoshop a good 30lbs off of McCarthy's face? This is one of the worst Photoshop jobs I have ever seen, but it's not just offensively bad craftsmanship – the intention behind it is downright nasty.The picture you see below is my approximation of what Melissa McCarthy actually looks like. Roll your mouse over the image below to see how they've made them look on The Heat's poster. Be prepared to recoil in terror.Am I missing something? Are they trying to pretend it's not her? Surely the whole point of The Heat's dynamic in the first place is that Sandra Bullock's character is skinny and prissy and uptight and Melissa McCarthy's character is bigger and bolshier and their diametric opposite? I'm flabbergasted at this flabby-blasting.A few people have said they assumed this was a joke. It's not a joke. Here's the full poster.
ISLAMABAD -- Five-year-old Mohammad Ashar Aziz will never be able to walk without orthopedic leg braces.
The youngest of three brothers from a village near Islamabad, they are one of just 17 children in the world -- all of them in Pakistan or Afghanistan -- who developed paralysis during 2017 from a wild polio-virus infection.
Their father, 41-year-old day laborer Hamid Aziz, is disconsolate because they repeatedly had the chance to immunize Mohammad Ashar for free during the past five years.
Instead, Hamid Aziz says they listened to the advice of a cleric in their village, who announced over loudspeakers of the madrasah, a local Islamic religious school, that the vaccine was “not good” for children's health, and prevented it from being administered to any of their sons.
Whenever teams of government and international aid workers came to their village as part of a massive polio-eradication campaign, Aziz and their illiterate wife, Huma, hid Mohammad Ashar and their siblings and told the vaccination teams there were no children in their home.
“Why didn't I give the vaccine to my son?” says Aziz, who quit school at the age of 14 and knew nothing about the polio vaccine.
“We believed what our cleric told us, but now I realize that we've not done the right thing for our son,” Aziz tells RFE/RL. “We realize how important it was and that we should have let them get the vaccine.”
Perceptions And Misinformation
Public health studies in Pakistan have shown that maternal illiteracy and low parental knowledge about vaccines -- together with poverty and rural residency -- are factors that most commonly influence whether children are vaccinated against the polio virus.
Nooran Afridi, a pediatrician at a private clinic in Pakistan's Khyber tribal region, says one of the biggest obstacles to eradicating polio in Pakistan has been “refusals” stemming from “antipolio propaganda” spread by conservative Islamic clerics in “backward areas.”
One common fallacy in parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan with low literacy rates is that the vaccine sterilizes young boys.
Antipolio propaganda also has been fueled by distrust in Western governments who fund vaccine programs -- particularly after the CIA staged a fake hepatitis vaccination campaign in 2011 to confirm the location of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan.
Since then, some clerics have even issued fatwas saying that children who become paralyzed or die from polio are “martyrs” because they refused to be tricked by a Western conspiracy.
Taliban militants in both Afghanistan and Pakistan also have propagandized that Western-made vaccines contain pig fat or alcohol, which are both forbidden in Islam.
Pakistan's Tehrik-i Taliban has used that false claim to justify its killing of more than 80 polio vaccination team workers in Pakistan since a massive polio-eradication effort was launched in 2012.
Massive Eradication Effort
Pakistani health workers, together with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international aid organizations, have immunized millions of children across the country since 2012 with more than 100 rounds of the vaccination drive.
More than 38 million children under the age of 5, the most susceptible age group for contracting the contagious disease, were vaccinated in Pakistan during 2017 alone.
The effort has brought Pakistan's paralytic polio rate to its lowest level since the early 1990s.
Six of the world's 17 paralytic cases in 2017 were reported in Pakistan, compared to 20 in 2016 and a peak of 198 cases in 2011.
In Afghanistan, there were 11 paralytic polio cases in 2017, down slightly from 13 the year before.
The WHO, which treats Afghanistan and Pakistan as a single epidemiological block, has warned that the risk of the spread of polio remains high along the countries' 1,500-kilometer shared border -- particularly among nomadic tribes that travel within both countries and across the frontier.
But the WHO also has been encouraged by Pakistan's eradication efforts in its tribal regions along the border, where no new paralytic cases were reported during 2017.
Completely eradicating polio from Pakistan “will depend on reaching all children who have not been vaccinated,” it said in a late November report.
Both countries demonstrated “strong progress, with independent technical advisory groups underscoring the feasibility of rapidly interrupting transmission of the remaining polio virus strains,” according to the WHO, which also praised closely coordinated Afghan-Pakistani initiatives to identify children missed by vaccination programs and to understand why they were missed.
Almost Gone
Pakistan had hoped to be removed from the list of polio-endemic countries by the end of 2017 by achieving its goal of no new paralytic cases for a year -- a result achieved by Nigeria in October.
Rana Safdar, coordinator for Pakistan's national Emergency Operations Center for Polio Eradication, announced in April that Pakistan was “about to defeat polio” because of a continued political commitment from Islamabad and support from international and Pakistani partners in the eradication programs.
The next round of mass vaccinations in Pakistan is scheduled for the end of December.
WATCH: Pakistan Launches New Polio Vaccination Drive (from July 2017)
Mezhar Nisar, a member of Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi's polio eradication task force, says they are confident the disease “is on the way to being rooted out from Pakistan.”
“We have addressed all the refusal issues in our overall social-mobilization strategy,” Nisar told RFE/RL. “We have involved religious scholars from the Ulema councils and community-based women health workers. This has brought the number of vaccination refusals to the minimal level. The program is fully on track.”
The Independent Monitoring Board of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) on December 8 praised the prime minister's “hands-on approach” with Pakistani provincial leaders.
Meanwhile, in Cairo, the Islamic Advisory Group for Polio Eradication has issued a new training manual for madrasah students that supports polio eradication efforts with practical guidance about engaging with local communities in support of vaccination.
Endpolio Pakistan, which brings nongovernmental and government experts in Pakistan together with international health organizations, says declarations by Muslim scholars in Ulema councils were critical to eliminating new paralytic polio cases during 2017 from Pakistan's tribal areas along the Afghan border.
In the town of Akora Khattak in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam party chief Maulana Samiul Haq declared a fatwa in late 2013 at the Darul Uloom Haqqania religious seminary, stating that “there is nothing forbidden” in the polio vaccine.
Haq, who had close ties with the late Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, said it is “the responsibility” of the religious scholars in the Ulema councils "to remove misconceptions about the use of vaccines to protect children from the crippling disease.”
They also publicly declared that Islamic Shari'a law “has made it clear that there is no harm in it. Rather, the treatment is an obligation.”
Other clerics have issued appeals for ordinary citizens, religious scholars, and tribal elders to fully support the polio vaccination initiative across Pakistan so that every child is vaccinated -- insisting that the vaccine's ingredients are, beyond any doubt, permissible under traditional Islamic law.
Hamid Aziz says they wish they would have had that kind of Islamic instruction when their son was born in 2012.
Instead, Aziz is now struggling on their intermittent wages of about $7 per day to come up with the funds needed to buy the leg braces that their youngest son will need to use for the rest of their life in order to walk.
“Now I am asking other parents to allow the medical workers to administer the polio vaccine to their children,” Aziz told RFE/RL. “It is good for your children.”

Above La Paz, gleaming red, green and yellow cable cars glide across the sky. Outside the southern city of Potosí, a formerly long-dormant smelting plant is turning out lead ingots. In the eastern state of Santa Cruz, a new project is bringing natural gas for cooking into more homes.
Bolivia is riding an economic high partly based on greater state control of natural resources and an unusually long period of political stability – not what critics expected when Evo Morales, coca farmer, unionist and the country's first indigenous president, was elected in 2005.
Now Morales seems poised to win a resounding election victory – their third – that will take their presidency through 2020 and make them the longest-serving leader in Bolivian history.
Polls show them at 59 points, 41 points ahead of their closest competitor, thanks to the endorsement by labour and campesino organisations, and the support of many middle-class urban citizens. “Most people are voting for Evo because there is change,” said law student Marinalda Jemio.

Historically, Bolivia's vast reserves of natural resources created great wealth for a small number. Under Morales, that has started to change. Investment in the transport system, cash grants for schoolchildren, women and the elderly, and a scheme to bring natural gas for cooking into more homes have led many voters to feel that Bolivia's mineral wealth is finally benefiting its impoverished people.
In 2002, when Morales made their first bid for president, the US ambassador warned Bolivians against electing a man who rose to national prominence as the leader of the country's largest coca farmers' union. Coca has a long history of traditional uses in Bolivia but is also the raw material needed to make cocaine.
“Morales certainly disappointed conservative critics abroad and at home who claimed their tenure would lead to economic collapse, social chaos, unbridled cocaine production, violence and abandonment by the international community,” said Kathryn Ledebur, director of policy analyst group the Andean Information Network.
“He took almost everyone by surprise with sound, homespun macroeconomic policies, and an ability to confront US political pressure without immediate dramatic adverse consequences.” But as well as confounding their critics, Morales has also disappointed some of their supporters.
“The indigenous movement has been betrayed by this government,” said Cancio Rojas, one of the leaders of the National Council of Ayllus and Markas of Qullasuyu (Conamaq), a group of traditional governing bodies. Rojas, who was jailed and released for their role in a 2012 mining protest, said the government had failed in its promises to empower indigenous peoples and protect the environment – and sought to divide indigenous organisations that question its policies.
Morales has repeatedly pledged to give priority to the protection of Pachamama (Mother Earth) but, according to environmental activist Fabrizio Uscamayta, this has not led to concrete protections in Bolivia. “I think for us it's painful because that [environmental management] was one of the principal points in government proposals, but sadly it's the point that has been least accomplished,” they said.
The Bolivian constitution allows a president just two terms, but Morales's party argued that because their first term was under the country's former constitution, which was replaced in 2009, they can legitimately stand again. The constitutional court agreed, and public opinion seems to support the move. Morales has a great deal of company in Latin America when it comes to legally justifying extending a presidency, including Alberto Fujimori in Peru, Rafael Correa in Ecuador, and, perhaps most famously, Hugo Chávez in Venezuela.
Javier Pari, who works in a La Paz bank, says Morales will win the election not because of unreserved endorsement of their government, but because the opposition has failed to generate excitement. “There is no new political figure who has come out to say: ‘We're different, we're going to form a new kind of government',” they said. “So even if people are against it [a third term], it's going to happen.”
Please note, before I begin, that the following are all my own thoughts and words. So, by their very nature, they will be subjective – you'd be amazed of some of the comments I get posted to this blog regarding my audacity to place my opinions on my own site. I welcome discussion, comment and counter opinion – please keep the trolling for the forums.
Introduction
I have been conducting an experiment for the last few years. I was initially fascinated by the watch forums and markets pronouncing for or against so-called homage watches and watchmakers. Is watchmaking an “art” in the true sense? Isn't all art in some way derivative? Isn't even the most “original” art a homage in some sense?
Alternatively, is watchmaking about branding?
And so, in the interests of personal curiosity and fascination with watches, I have been buying and selling known homage's to try and make up my own mind regarding the value of the form. I firmly believe that you can't judge something over the web or without buying or at least holding the item in the flesh. There is something to be said for the feelings of “buyer's remorse” for illuminating your real feelings.
Anyway, Just what is a homage? Homage is surely more than mere mimicry, the sort of pastiche “fake” watches found all over the markets of the Far East. I remember visiting a watch market in Li Jiang, China and coming across a fake Bell & Ross watch for $90 that was indistinguishable from the real thing. I thought to myself that this was as simple as a fake got: a watch that copies the original in its surface aspects. A skin-deep pastiche. Shallow. Fake. Like some sort of animal pretending to be something it isn't to ensnare the unwary.
But, this again brought pause for thought as the “fake” Bell & Ross had inside it a quartz mechanism and Japanese Quartz at that. The upshot of which is that it probably kept better time than the original. Why pay that extra $2000? After all the “art”, the look and emotion of the piece, is all present and correct in the copy and it looks the same on one's wrist in terms of fashion. Apart from snobbery over watch internals, complications and other “inside” aspects, is there anything to get hot under the collar about with a “fake” watch and is the homage more than this?
Homage is not a bad word in itself, or at least it wasn't historically, for to give “homage” was to worship something greater than one did. Worship. Fealty. It is a Middle Ages word that only recently has slipped into this new meaning of being a fake copy surfing on the coat-tails of its betters. I think that anything can be a homage. From the cinematic works of Quentin Tarantino, which are chock-full of loving little homage's to classic films, to Hellmanns, which is surely a homage to Mayonnaise (either that or wallpaper paste).
Homage Watches
What do we want from our homage watches? Surely its final purpose, just like the original, is to tell the time? I really don't think so. On my return from my travels, I went looking for something to replace my ever-reliable Christopher Ward Kingfisher.
Many people told me that watches, especially mechanical “Swiss” watches, were old hat. “Everyone just uses their phone to tell the time these days,” they would claim, “why bother with a watch?”
I always answered with, “…and which phone do you own?”
To which the person would invariably go on about their shiny new phone, how screwed they got – or didn't get – by their last upgrade, their minutes, its megabytes and all those lovely megapixels. In other words, they bought and used their latest ninja-phone from Apple for exactly the same reason I bought my watch. Yes, I could tell time by using a phone, but hell – I could tell the time by looking at the relative position of the sun! Beyond the simple divination of working hours, watches have the same purpose as modern phones: marking personal status.
I realised that like eating peas on the back of one's fork (I can't as they fall off), having gone the “right” school (I didn't, I went to a comprehensive), studied at the “right” University (I couldn't get into Cambridge) and come from the “right” side of the tracks (I certainly don't), a watch marks you out as a member of “the club”.
Whatever that club is.
Therefore, buying the right watch for me, one I was happy with, was to say where I saw myself. What the watch “said” of me was an evolving target that changed as I did. This sat well as a hypothesis and so came the testing.
I started with the Christopher Ward and their C60, which I have written about at length on this site.
Sure, the C60 apes the watches' it is homage to, but is it subtle enough to be only an “inspiration”? Alternatively, has it mixed so many features from other makers to melange into pastiche and be merely a copy?
Upon purchasing and wearing the C60 (the only way to truly judge a watch) I soon realised that no, it is definitely not a pastiche, but that this value is subtle.
A thin ice Christopher Ward surfs with every new release. He, I believe, attempts a “distillation” rather than hodge-podge the elements found in the original. Of course such a judgement is subjective and so I turned to the home of the subjective opinion: the Internet.
I knew I had found the crucible in which to test my hypothesis when I found a three page forum argument over the lugs on a watch.
“For me lug-holes are sacrosanct.” – forum commenter
Each provocateur had posted images of, what to me, were identical lugs and loudly claimed that one was the original style marked out by genius, pure and bright, and the other was a filthy and unholy amalgamation aping its betters, clearly the result of a delusional mind intent on duping people with inferior produce.
I'd be buggered if I could tell between them which was original and anyway, is originality so important?
Being original is being first, the template, the archetype from which copies are made. This is all well and good, but it is also easy to fake. That is the power of branding.
On Branding
My wife was a branding consultant and I have been well trained by them in “brand awareness”. Branding is in the job of creating fashion. Brands don't “come” from anywhere. Not in the way they purport to. Take the brand “Superdry”. It's Japanese right?
Nope.
That Japanese text translates as “Be extreme desiccation!” It originates not in Tokyo's 109 building as it appears to, but much closer to home: in an East England market.
/Digression
I have a funny story about the 109 building. Walking around this Mecca of cool, this Nebula-like birthplace of half the worlds fashion trends – constantly full to the rafters with the Japanese super-cool, my wife sees a really expensive patterned bag and loudly shouts, “I have that pattern on my ironing board” The looks on the faces of those around me as they struggled with the twin emotions of being made fools of (so embarrassing) and trying to look snide at my wife (who as I said is an expert in branding and dresses quite cool herself) was priceless.
/end digression
What its designers did was grasp the zeitgeist regarding many peoples' Japanophilia and present itself as a perfect, distilled, “Japanese” brand.
The “Superdry Scuba Multi-Dial Watch” – Note: “Not suitable for scuba diving.”
So is it fake? No, it's as original as anything else. The truth is that there is no such thing as fake in branding; because they are all fake.
Superdry's latest collection is all about “Superdry Original” a postmodern retcon of history to present the brand as though it existed “in the past” (when we all looked much better). Soon this will literally become the truth and accepted; 1984 style. I pick on Superdry not because I am claiming their quality is lesser or that the brand is not laser focussed, indeed not. I have been to Japan, it is exactly like Superdry's brand suggests; with some items (for some reason) costing the Earth (such as Porter bags and Buzz Rickson jackets). All Superdry has done is brought the Japanese-cool “feel” to us without international shipping charges for “real” Japanese items. This could be any brand. All brands are designed to create what is known as “stickiness”.
How a Business Uses Branding
A business starts as either a bespoke or a volume operation. As each cycle of the business comes around the board will often set the balance of the company's finances (the rate at which money goes in and out) in such a way that the two values of Quality and Price go up. It has to happen slowly of course because if the Price hikes overnight, no matter the Quality of the product, sales will decrease as the customer will be able to buy what it perceives as the same Quality product for less elsewhere. This relationship works interdependently. However, the power of a brand is that it introduces Stickiness into this equation. It is simply the measurement of how likely the customer is to go elsewhere when Prices rise (or indeed Quality falls). Eventually, over a long enough period and with very careful management, the Price of the product will rise high above its normal relationship to the Quality. This happens mainly because the client actively enjoys the product so much that they define themselves through the relationship to it.  They are “stuck”. The Price can then rise to almost any level because the Quality is perceived to be in relation. Combined with a perceived “limited supply” and the price will raise even faster and stay high (a la diamonds). Wine too uses this model with the First Growth wines fetching crazy prices. Such as a Petrus '66, which I once saw on a menu for 23 thousand pounds per bottle!
Apple Computers do this notoriously well and are often used as the ultimate business example of this phenomenon. Their late evangelist of “sticky”, Steve Jobs, proclaimed that theirs was the best product and people believed him. I am not saying Apple doesn't make a good product, that would be slightly ironic as I am typing this on an iPad, what I mean is that any brand can evolve to drive the Price. Brands can even be reborn. Look at Skoda. A joke when I was a kid, a high quality brand now. Where did that perception go? How did Burberry go from being a high quality brand, to be all chavish, and now to be high quality again? Simple, it sorted the Quality of the product and then hired branding experts like my wife's team. One such company that literally did this was Morrisons supermarket and they got rid of that terrible Black and Yellow logo in favour of “Middle Class” green and then went out and hired Take That to sing about it.
The Watch as a Brand
I am sure you can see the parallel with watches. Rolex for example, while both “original” and of “high quality” (not that I could tell the lugs apart from the cheaper one) creates a “Stickiness” outside all relation to the product itself. Rolex are not even at the top of this pyramid. Take Patek Philippe whose watches top out at simply massive prices, this is at complete odds with the quality of the product. Of course, there is enough money in the budget for the company to make a high quality product in the first place, but beyond the pure value of the gold used, and the “custom” watch internals, it is the value of the brand, the long-term measure of its stickiness, which puts them on top.
That stickiness becomes completely intangible in the luxury end of the market. For example, see if you can tell the difference between these two watches? Which one costs $15,000 and which is the Frankenstein monster worth $200? Remember to chose based only on the term of the quality you can “see” in the images:
Chosen?
If you chose the one on the right, you're wrong? I swapped the labels.
A cheat I know, but don't just take my word for all this. Here is the director IWC admitting to all this:
Waving Bulgarian and EU flags, several hundred Bulgarian Muslims protested in the southern town of Pazardzhik on Tuesday against the start of a trial of 13 people accused of spreading radical Islamist ideas.
Relatives and supporters of the 13 suspects say they were preaching traditional ideas, not radical Islamist propaganda.
The trial of the 13 members of the Al Waqf-Al Islami organisation started on Tuesday.
The organisation is not officially registered in the predominantly Orthodox Christian country in which about 10 per cent of the population are Muslims, according to the latest census.
The suspects are charged with preaching an anti-democratic ideology, with seeking to impose Sharia law, with leading and participating in an unregistered religious entity and with preaching religious intolerance.
According to the indictment, the belief systems of the defendants are broadly in line with elements of Salafism.
One of the defendants has a prior conviction on a similar charge for which they were handed a three-year suspended sentence with five years of probation and a public reprimand.

Sajjad Hussain/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Arvind Kejriwal delivered a speech in New Delhi, Oct 13.
Switzerland is the birthplace of the International Red Cross and the Geneva Conventions against egregious human-rights abuses. The country is regarded as a bastion of religious tolerance. Yet in 2009, Switzerland imposed a national ban on the construction of minarets, the prayer towers of mosques, in a nation-wide referendum of citizens. Because Switzerland is a country that has adopted “direct democracy,” the referendum's verdict became the law of the land.
The law was met with widespread condemnation as an affront to religious freedom. David Diaz-Jogeix, Amnesty International's deputy program director for Europe and Central Asia remarked: "That Switzerland, a country with a long tradition of religious tolerance and the provision of refuge to the persecuted, should have accepted such a grotesquely discriminatory proposal is shocking."
Jean Quatremer, a reporter with the French daily Libération, fittingly drew a link between the minaret ban and the perils of direct democracy, saying: "Once again, direct democracy has proved its extremely dangerous nature. By allowing people to express their fear of the other, their rejection of rationality and their focus on short-term interests, referendums are decidedly a dangerous instrument in the hands of demagogues of all stripes. It is easier to understand why several democratic countries have simply outlawed them."
India is one of the many countries that have not adopted direct democracy. We are a representative democracy, where people elect their representatives to make laws and policies on their behalf. However, over the last couple of years, there has been an increasing clamor by Arvind Kejriwal and their supporters for a move toward a Swiss-type direct democracy. Mr. Kejriwal claims that direct legislation protects citizens by allowing them to circumvent corrupt lawmakers that are beholden to special interests.
Mr. Kejriwal has repeatedly called for the introduction of referendums and initiatives. A referendum is a method whereby people, by direct vote, can decide on a new law or policy or whether existing legislation passed by Parliament should be rejected. On the other hand, an initiative lets a group of citizens initiates new legislation or constitutional amendment by putting their draft to a nationwide direct vote. Recently, outraged by the manner in which the approval of foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail was voted on in the legislature, Mr. Kejriwal again stressed the need for a nation-wide referendum to decide the issue rather than a parliamentary vote.
The Swiss referendum banning minarets has great implications for demands for direct democracy in a country like India, which has many minority factions. It can be argued that mass participation exposes minority groups to potentially oppressive policy outcomes (like the Swiss minaret ban) that are favored by only a slim majority of the voters (i.e. 50% plus one vote.)
The examples of unfortunate initiatives put on ballots in American states that have adopted direct democracy drive home this point. Some of these initiatives include the elimination of bilingual programs for Hispanics, a prohibition on laws providing anti-discrimination protection for homosexuals, and the denial of basic access to health, education, and medical benefits for illegal immigrants.
Perhaps, this is why the framers of the Indian Constitution wanted laws to be made by elected representatives even though the interim president of the Constituent Assembly, Sachchidananda Sinha, had brought the Swiss Constitution to the attention of the drafters.
The framers instead relied heavily on the U.S. Constitution, the Commonwealth models in Canada and Australia and the British parliamentary system. In the case of the election of the President of India and the process of amending the Constitution, the framers expressly rejected the idea of a nation-wide referendum.
The government that the Constitution structured was about trying to spread power to prevent tyranny. That's why, for instance, we have three branches, with separate executive, legislative and judicial powers. The Constitution also diffuses power through federalism: dividing power between the central and state governments. This balance is absent in direct democracy. Without the checks and balances of a representative, separated-powers system that encourages deliberation and minority representation, minority rights are at increased risk.
This is not to say, however, that all demands for direct democracy in India are irrelevant. Yehezkel Dror, a renowned political scientist, has observed that direct democracy can work reasonably well in small communities, where people have personal experience of most issues, provided that this is combined with a suitable deliberative process and the professional explanation of complex issues. Jean-Jaques Rousseau was also an advocate of direct democracy, but again only in small regions.
Direct democracy is a potent form of government when every citizen in a designated small precinct has the ability (and the will) to contribute to the discussion. To some extent, concerns of minority oppression, inherent in direct democracy, are also considerably alleviated when it is implemented at the local level over everyday affairs such as health, sanitation, and the provision of basic services. In small regions, the entire community can congregate and effectively discuss issues intertwined with their daily affairs.
Recognizing this tenet, the framers drafted Article 40 of the Constitution which mandates states to organize village “panchayats” of elected representatives and endow them with powers to enable them to function as units of self government. Further, “gram sabhas,” or gatherings of adult voters in the village, and the panchayats created under the 73rd and the 74th amendments to the Constitution are compelling examples of the type of direct democracy espoused by Professor Dror and Rousseau.
In urban areas, the Model Nagara Raj Bill of 2008 seeks to create a corresponding unit in cities to gram sabhas in rural areas. The bill is a mandatory reform under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, which means that states must enact community-participation legislation based on the bill to be eligible for funds under the JNURM program.
Mr. Kejriwal and their newly-formed political party are a rare, and perhaps unique, counterpoint to many political parties whose main problems are lack of fresh ideas, deep-rooted caste politics and corruption. At a time of turmoil in Indian politics, Mr. Kejriwal is an important outlier in the game. As Pratap Bhanu Mehta recently pointed out, Mr. Kejriwal's readiness to put decentralization on the agenda is tantalizing. However, they should hold fast to constitutional methods and abandon the rhetoric on unconstitutional nation-wide referendums. As a start, they can speak more about the need for all states to urgently implement the bill establishing urban councils under the Model Nagara Raj Bill.

Senator Ted Cruz seeks to overturn two D.C. laws
Senator Ted Cruz is seeking to overturn two DC acts, the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Act and Human Rights Amendment Act, on the basis that they violate religious freedom.
The Non-Discrimination Act prohibits employers from discriminating against those who have abortions or use birth control, and the Human Rights Act prevents religious educational institutions from denying funding to gay and lesbian student groups.
Cruz has not been the only one involved with this issue. As dcist reported, Heritage Action for America, an advocacy group, as well as other conservative organizations have encouraged Congress to oppose these acts. On the other side of the debate, more than 50 women's rights and gay rights groups have pushed to maintain these laws so that “those who work and study in the District are treated fairly”.
According to the Post, Senator James Lankford, who worked with Cruz to introduce these potential changes, said on Wednesday, “What the DC council has done is a major threat to the fundamental right to religious freedom for DC residents and organizations, and a brazen display of intolerance.”
The two laws are currently under a mandatory 30-day review period. If Congress does not take any action, changes in the laws could become effective beginning next month.
Many in DC have taken issues with Cruz's attempt to overturn the two laws, considering they have previously been a staunch supporter of states' rights. Through this move, Cruz appears to be taking away DC's rights as a state to determine and enact its own laws.
Kimberly Perry, Head of DC Vote, an organization that advocates for voting representation in the district stated, “Senators Cruz and Lankford's move to disapprove a local District law is absurd and hypocritical. They are no guilty of the same federal overreach they often criticize in others,” the Post reported.
DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is also taking a stand against Cruz, especially since district residents do not have a say in Congress. They plan to work with friends and allies in Congress to make sure they oppose Cruz's changes in the laws.
Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton echoed Perry's sentiments in a statement: “In no other local jurisdiction in America with similar laws could such a naked violation of local self-government take place.”

(CNN) -- Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson will step down for six weeks in favor of a party colleague following a sex scandal involving their wife and amid allegations of irregular financial dealings.
Robinson has asked Democratic Unionist Party colleague Arlene Foster to carry out the functions of the first minister in their absence, they said in a statement.
Iris Robinson, also a top politician in the semi-autonomous British-run province, last week admitted having an affair with a 19-year-old and securing £50,000 ($80,000) from two business people to help them set up a cafe.
The 60 year old, who last week admitted attempting suicide and suffering severe depression, is receiving acute psychiatric treatment in Belfast, Peter Robinson said.
"As a father and a husband, I need to devote time to deal with family matters," they said.
Robinson also denied any knowledge of their wife's financial dealings and vowed to clear their name, saying they had called for a Parliamentary and Assembly inquiry into the matter.
"I continue to contend I have acted ethically and it is particularly painful at this time of great personal trauma that I have to defend myself from an unfounded and mischievous allegation," they said.
Addressing the Northern Ireland Assembly on Monday, enterprise minister Foster said they had discussed working arrangements with the offices of the first minister and the deputy first minister, a post held by Martin McGuinness of the republican Sinn Fein party in accordance with Northern Ireland's power-sharing agreement.
Robinson would be "seeking to clear their name in the days that lie ahead," they added.
Senior unionist politicians have expressed doubts about Robinson's prospects of political survival, with elections also due for parliament in London later this year. If they fall, the post of first minister and deputy first minister, held by Martin McGuinness of the republican Sinn Fein party, would have to be filled.
McGuinness can end their partnership with Robinson or refuse to be renominated if the East Belfast lawmaker is toppled.
The scandal has been exposed amid a tense backdrop in Northern Ireland. Republicans want more policing powers devolved from London to Belfast as their price for staying in government but the two main parties have failed to agree a deal on this.
In a statement issued Sunday, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said the Irish republican party was determined to see "beyond the current difficulties" and accused the DUP of failing to fulfil its political commitments.
"This is not about the Robinson's private family matters," Adams said. "Sinn Fein respect their right to privacy. It is about implementing outstanding political agreements that are essential to good government and public confidence."
Writing in the Times newspaper on Monday, Irish political expert Paul Bew said: "The brutal fact is that we were heading for a dangerous political crisis in Northern Ireland even before the Robinson revelations.
"It is now very difficult indeed to see how it might be avoided," added Bew, a member of Britain's House of Lords. "We could now face a very hard landing indeed."
Robinson's predecessor as First Minister said Sunday their position was becoming untenable. David Trimble, who jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1998 for their efforts to bring stability to Northern Ireland, predicted that Robinson would quit in the "next few days."
Fears are also high of an upsurge in violence in Northern Ireland, where three decades of unrest known as The Troubles left at least 3,500 people dead but was largely ended by the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.
Last year, two British soldiers and a police officer were killed in attacks claimed by dissident republicans. And last Friday a Roman Catholic police officer was wounded when a bomb exploded under their car.
Iris Robinson is a controversial figure in their own right. In 2008 they caused a storm by suggesting that homosexuals should seek psychiatric counselling.
NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ—In August 2007, two women filed paperwork to create a political action committee (PAC) for the stated purpose to "help elect and support candidates to public office." One was an official associated with the city government and the local Democratic party.
Over the next three years, "Women For Good Government" quietly raked in over $238,000, and just as quietly donated most of it to political candidates before it mysteriously ceased operations in 2010, with just over $31,000 remaining in its coffers.
One might expect an organization with a name like that to primarily support female candidates, or that their supporters might be primarily women. However, both assumptions are incorrect, according to the group's filings with the Election Law Enforcement Commission (ELEC).
One also might expect a "good government" organization to produce materials for campaigns, maintain a small staff or perhaps an office, at least a website. But, Women For Good Government had none of those things. They never paid any staff, they used a New Brunswick post office box as their official address, and they spent only $160.39 on administrative costs in three years of action.
The organization never issued a statement to the press and it appears they did not do much more than collect donations, report them to ELEC, and pass those same monies on to the campaign funds of various candidates for elected office, mostly in Middlesex County.
They never took a position on an issue, never announced any of the candidates or organizations they were sending money to, and never made known a process for candidates to seek their financial support.
In many cases, the PAC served as a "middle-man" for donations from corporations, developers, lawyers, engineers, consultants, and contractors that do business with the government, allowing those entities to legally exceed donation limits or otherwise circumvent municipal laws expressly crafted to prevent the purchasing of influence over elected officials.
Meanwhile, another similar organization based in New Brunswick had been operating in a similar fashion since 2005. The Raritan Bay Leadership Fund was run out of the New Brunswick offices of the politically-connected law firm Shamy, Shipers, & Lonski PC, and it courted many of the same exact donors as Women For Good Government.
Since 2008, The Raritan Bay Leadership Fund collected over $200,000 in contributions and dispersed the funds to candidates across the state.
Previously, political committees like these went largely unnoticed while funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars into local, county, and state electoral campaigns without scrutiny.
No doubt other "under-the-radar" fundraising organizations exist across NJ, under the control of partisans in both Democrat and Republican circles. But nowhere is there such apparent, yet unacknowledged coordination between multiple PAC's as there is in Middlesex County.
A NewBrunswickToday.com investigation shows at least ten political action committees based in Central New Jersey operated in a strikingly similar fashion, collecting donations mostly from the same pool of corporations, developers, lawyers, engineers, consultants, and contractors.
The conservative blog MoreMonmouthMusings.com was the first to report on the irregular pattern of donations. Their reporting shows that, between Jan. 1, 2008 and Aug. 1, 2011, two of the top three most successful "scrutiny avoidance" fundraising operations were based in New Brunswick:
Women For Good Government PAC (New Brunswick): $238,616
Committee for Civic Responsibility (Princeton): $222,450
Raritan Bay Leadership Fund (New Brunswick): $203,466
New Expectations PAC (Edison): $196,066
Democracy in Motion PAC (Sayreville): $189,716
19th District Democratic Leadership Fund (Sayreville): $144,650
People Energizing Government PAC (Bernardsville): $136,900
Coalition for Government Efficiency (Eatontown): $130,350
Citizens for Green Environment (Middlesex): $119,350
Higher Point Leadership (Millstone Borough): $59,300
ELEC records show that each of the committees had a remarkably simliar list of donors, as well as little or no expenditures beyond transfers to political candidates and party organizations. They also handed the funds over to many of the same campaigns, most of them in Middlesex County.
More often than not, donors' intentions were further obscured when funds are given to a county or municipal party organization that in turn spends them on one or more campaigns at their discretion.
This phenomenon, and the spending in general, occurred overwhelmingly in municipalities that had adopted pay-to-play reform laws designed to prevent large donations from companies or individuals seeking to do business with the government.
In some cases, the committees even transferred funds to and from one another.
To this day, it is unclear who specifically decided which campaigns to support or how much to spend...
CHAIRMAN BARNES SPILLS THE BEANS
Connections between shady political action committees (PACs) and State
Senators Bob Smith & Jon Wisniewski were explored by the Star-Ledger
A recent report in the Star-Ledger has shed new light on the mystery of who really controlled these campaign warchests. Peter Barnes Jr., Chairman of the Middlesex County Democratic Organization (MCDO) fingered State Senator Bob Smith as the supervisor of Women For Good Government and several other entities like it.
"I am aware of the PAC's in general, but I'm not aware of them in particular... They're run by Senator Bob Smith," they told the Star-Ledger after hemming and hawing when asked if they knew about the secretive organizations.
Smith, from Piscataway, represents their hometown, as well as New Brunswick, Milltown, and North Brunswick in the State Senate.
The report also implicated Assemblyman Jon Wisniewski, who serves as the chairperson of the NJ State Democratic Committee.
Current and former employees of their legislative office were connected to several of the PAC's, according to the report. A legislative aide to Wisniewski, Mary Lou McCormick, is paid to prepare The Raritan Bay Leadership Fund's reports for ELEC.
For their part, Wisniewski denied any affiliation with the secretive organizations. It was also reported that they said they asked their then-28-year-old chief of staff Nicholas Fixmer to step down as Chairman of Democracy in Motion PAC when they learned of their involvement in the organization.
"Some of them have given contributions either to me or to the state party, which they're entitled to do. I'm entitled to ask for it, and that's it," they told the Star-Ledger.
Democracy in Motion PAC, and the 19th District Leadership Fund, both based in Wisniewski's hometown of Sayreville, raised a combined $334,366 since 2008, according to the MoreMonmouthMusings.com report.
Sayreville is one of many towns that has adopted a pay-to-reform ordinance to curb the influence of money on its local elections.
The laws usually say that companies seeking to do business with the government cannot donate more than a certain amount to candidates for local office, though limits differ from one municipality to another. New Brunswick does not have a pay-to-play reform ordinance on the books.
The process of circumventing pay-to-play laws by donating through an intermediary is known as "wheeling" and it enables corporations or individuals to donate in excess of state or local contribution limits.
A story published on PolitickerNJ.com said that a source connected with Middlesex County politics had confirmed there was a list of these PAC's shown to donors, many of whom sought to gain or maintain government contracts.
The source said that potential donors were given a menu of the vaguely-named political committees. Barnes denied knowledge of it, but said it might have been a past practice in Middlesex County.
"It might have happenned before that way before my tenure, but not since I was elected chairperson." Barnes was elected Chairman in June 2011.
Women For Good Government had never before been tied to the MCDO or any elected official until Barnes' remarks implicating Sen. Smith were published. The story, and a subsequent follow-up, said that Smith had not return multiple requests for comment about the matter.

Funny Money, Part 2: 1st Gift to "Women For Good Government" Came From Indicted Ex-Sheriff Accused of Harassing 5 Women
Qataris on Monday rushed to supermarkets all around the country to buy food products after Saudi Arabia closed Qatar's only land border.
Customers could be seen piling their carts high with supplies of milk, water, rice and eggs at several popular grocery stores today, which were even busier than is usual for Ramadan.
Photographs of empty chiller shelves have already been circulating on social media sites, as residents reportedly cleared out stores of chicken and other fresh and frozen meat in some shops, according to Doha News.
80% of Qatar's food imports are via a Persian Gulf Cooperation Council food trade supply chain, and unless the crisis resolved immediately, there will be shortages, according to industry sources.
Qatar's foreign affairs ministry, however, insisted in a statement that the border closing would not impact normal life in the country for citizens and residents.
It added that the Qatari government will “take all the necessary measures to make certain of that and to thwart attempts to negatively affect Qatari society and economy.”
The grocery rush follows an escalating rift between Qatar and its neighboring Gulf states.
Earlier this morning, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, and Bahrain announced that they would close all land, air and sea borders with Qatar within 24 hours. Yemen and Libya also joined them later.
WNYC's Brian Lehrer Show got a call this morning from “Louis in the Village” and everyone thinks it sounded a lot like Louis C.K. According to the Observer, Louis said, “you know, I really like this mayor, and it's bothered me that there's sort of a culture of clickbait in the news right now that only little negative stories get attention.”
The show think it was Louis, the channel is “pretty sure” it was Louis. But we've all been fooled before. A few weeks ago the internet went crazy when someone on Reddit posted a porn clip with a star whose face was offscreen but sounded a lot like Louis CK based on voice (and a signature black t-shirt) but that got firmly debunked. Is this going to be the next internet trend? #ThatWasLouie!
Listen to the audio here, and jump to 18:50 for the call.
Hold the press, we're pretty sure Louis C.K. just called into the @BrianLehrer show…anyone else hears that? Can someone text them and ask? — WNYC 🎙 (@WNYC) August 18, 2015
You're not the only one thinking that, @sheiman. Wonder if it really was @LouieFX…? https://t.co/XBKrYnEjvw — Brian Lehrer Show (@BrianLehrer) August 18, 2015
If you missed the whole porn Louie escapade, you can watch a vine created by Gawker. Warning, It's VERY not safe for work. If you didn't already pick on it, it's actual porn.
So is it, or isn't it Louis CK?

Adnan Syed, Subject Of 'Serial' Podcast, Gets Hearing On New Evidence
Enlarge this image toggle caption AP AP
More than 15 years after they were convicted of murdering their ex-girlfriend, Adnan Syed has been granted a hearing to let their lawyers present a possible alibi and questions about cellphone data. Attorneys for Syed, the key figure in the popular podcast Serial, also want to probe "alleged prosecutorial misconduct."
The new development comes months after the Maryland Court of Special Appeals granted Syed's request for a review of their case, giving new momentum to their efforts to appeal their 2000 conviction in the murder of Baltimore high school student Hae Min Lee in January of 1999. Lee's body had been found in a city park, one month after they disappeared. They had been strangled.
Now 35, Syed is serving a life prison term over Lee's death. Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Martin Welch granted the request for a hearing Friday, ordering that it be scheduled sometime in the next 10 days.
The hearing will focus on several facets of Syed's case, including: allegations that their legal representation had been inadequate; claims that prosecutors engaged in misconduct; and the emergence of potential alibi testimony from Asia McClain, a former high school classmate of both Syed and Lee.
McClain was one of the people featured in the Serial podcast about Lee's killing and its aftermath. In an affidavit filed early this year, McClain said they had seen Syed in the Woodlawn High School library on the day of Lee's murder; they also said they were never contacted by Syed's defense attorney.
Questions about the reliability of cellphone-locator technology — and whether it was carefully scrutinized — are a new front in the case, opened by Syed's current attorney, Justin Brown.
From The Baltimore Sun:
"Brown also put forward for the first time a fax cover sheet from AT&T in which the phone company raised questions about the reliability of technology at the time to pinpoint the location of a phone. "Brown obtained an affidavit from the state's expert witness regarding phone technology, who said they would have wanted to know about the disclaimer on the fax cover sheet and it could have changed their testimony."
In their order issued Friday, Welch said allowing Syed "to raise the issue of cell tower location reliability and supplement the record with relevant materials would be in the interests of justice."
Welch also ordered that Syed be allowed to introduce McClain's Jan. 13, 2015, affidavit, along with their potential testimony.
Serial, produced by Chicago Public Radio's WBEZ and This American Life, launched in October of 2014 and quickly attracted a devoted following. The second season of the podcast is expected to premiere this month.
Do you feel proud to be who you are?
A vast majority of LGBTI people still feel need to lie or hide their gender or sexual identity, according to a new survey.
Pride in London surveyed more than 1,000 LGBTI people about how they feel discussing their private lives in public.
The theme for this year's Pride in London is ‘no filter'.
It found 74% said they felt they needed to hide who they are to other people.
This was due to a large proportion of LGBTI people feeling ‘threatened by other people's attitudes and behaviors towards them'.
Other findings:
77% of LGBTI respondents had revealed their sexuality to friends, while 50% had come out to all their colleagues.
2% of the population has been bullied at work because of their gender, compared with 10% of LGBTI respondents in the survey
77% of LGBTI respondents said they felt uncomfortable being their true self in public, against 23% of the general population
59% of LGBTI respondents had felt threatened by other people's attitudes and behaviors towards them, compared with 16% of the wider population
41% of gay men said they would think twice about holding a partner's hand in public, dropping to 5% among the general population

In a last-ditch effort to stop the Iron County Commission from selling its ambulance service, area mayors started circulating an online petition Friday that as of Monday evening already had generated nearly 400 signatures.
Launched just days before the commission is set to take in financial bids from companies interested in purchasing the ambulance service, the petition was started by skeptics of the sale in hopes of drumming up enough local support to influence the commissioners.
There are also 50 to 60 more signatures by residents who were approached at home by ambulance workers who took the petition door to door.
The petition was started by Paragonah Mayor Connie Robinson on behalf of the Iron County Coordinating Council, which is comprised of local mayors. Robinson worked in conjunction with EMT Clay Allred, who set up the petition online and started circulating it through social media.
"We did this to show the commission that selling the ambulance service to a private company is not what the people of Iron County want," Allred said. "They're not representing the people that they were voted in to represent."
Robinson said they started the petition after being approached by several members of their community.
"I did this for the people," they said. "I had so many people come to me who wanted to voice their opinion and kept asking me what they could do to help. I also wanted to let the commissioners know they are voted in to do the will of the people, and this is not the will of the people."
While Robinson had given the deadline of Dec. 23 to finalize the petition and give it to the commissioners, they said they decided to keep it going through the coming weekend.
Allred and Robinson both said they are pleased with the overwhelming response they've already received. This weekend Allred, several residents and ambulance workers plan to take the petition door to door hoping they can obtain even more signatures.
Sheriff Mark Gower was one of the first to sign the petition. Having strongly opposed the commissioners' proposal to sell the ambulance service, Gower said again Monday they haven't changed their mind.
"I disagree with their decision to sell the ambulance service. I respectfully oppose it but I do oppose it," Gower said. "I'm not at odds with the commissioners. It's just that it's their job to make fiscal decisions, and it's mine to make public safety decisions, and hopefully we can meet somewhere in the middle."
While the commissioners have not yet voted to approve privatizing the ambulance service, they have continued to lean in that direction.
But will the petition sway any of the commissioners?
Commissioner Alma Adams said they would consider the number of signatures and weigh that number against all of the other "evidence."
Adams wouldn't commit however regarding the number of signatures it would take to sway the commissioners.

America's favorite female superhero has a new medal to pin on their Stars-and-Stripes bustier, thanks to the New-York Historical Society, which has awarded its annual American History Book Prize to Jill Lepore's best-selling “The Secret History of Wonder Woman.”
The book, which traces the character's roots back to the ideas of the pioneering birth-control activist Margaret Sanger (followed by a detour through the huckster, researcher and bondage enthusiast William Moulton Marston), was chosen from a field of 132 submissions, many no doubt heavier on different kinds of uniforms.
“The book pushes forward the frontiers of knowledge around the story of women's rights as it retrieves crucial but forgotten history,” Louise Mirrer, the society's president and chief executive, said in a statement. Ms. Lepore, a professor at Harvard, noted that “this was an incredibly fun book to write.”
The prize, whose other recent winners include Doris Kearns Goodwin, Drew Gilpin Faust and Gordon S. Wood, will be presented at a black-tie dinner on April 17, during the society's Weekend With History event. It comes with the title American Historian Laureate and an engraved medal, which might complement some of the Wonder Woman-related memorabilia Ms. Lepore encountered during the course of their research.
“Favorite object encountered?” they wrote in an email. “A lock of William Moulton Marston's hair, clipped by their mother in 1894, wrapped in tissue, and labelled ‘Baby's First Hair Cut.' Second favorite? A women's health center newsletter from 1973 featuring Wonder Woman wielding a speculum on the cover and, inside, instructions on how to conduct a vaginal self-exam.”

Lost Left's Levollinen is a 2012 release that has been criminally under-appreciated. Lead singer Ben Pritchard crafts stark, effortless songs whose depth appears to grow and multiply in the cavernous auditory spaces that surround their poetic lyrics. Pritchard writes in lyrical fragments rather than narrative arcs, that signal a mood or theme without spelling it out for the listener. The result is an authentic minimalism, where the essence of Lost Left's songs are exposed and brought to the forefront of the material.
Needless to say, I was thrilled to learn last week that the band has been recording new material with intentions of a new album sometime next year. The first taste comes in the form of “Minerva”. The track is one of a pair of acoustic recordings laid down in a church in the borough of Hackney in North London. The sincerity of Pritchard's delivery is one that forces the listener to approach the song with a somber seriousness. “Haunting” is an adjective that I find vague and trite in music criticism, but one that nevertheless comes to mind on “Minerva.” The giggles and shrieks of children at play that emanate from just outside the church provide a comforting contrast to the solemnity at hand.

Album Review: Lost Left Levollinen
COLUMBUS, Ohio — Two years after it passed unanimously in Ohio's state Legislature, a law meant to inform patients what health care procedures will cost is in a state of suspended animation.
One of the most stringent in a group of similar state laws being proposed across the country, Ohio's Healthcare Price Transparency Law stipulated that providers had to give patients a “good faith” estimate of what non-emergency services would cost individuals after insurance before they commenced treatment.
But the law didn't go into force on Jan. 1 as scheduled. And its troubled odyssey illustrates the political and business forces opposing a common-sense but controversial solution to rein in high health care costs for patients: Let patients see prices.
Many patient advocates say such transparency would be helpful for patients, allowing them to shop around for some services to hold down out-of-pocket costs, as well as adjust their household budgets for upcoming health-related outlays at a time of high-deductible plans.
At the Ohio Statehouse, the law's greatest champion in state government has been Rep. Jim Butler, a Republican and former Navy fighter pilot whose wife is a physician. They authored the legislation and has beat the drum for it since they got the idea in 2013, as they waited for a garage mechanic to repair their car and absorbed the shop's posted rates for brake jobs, oil changes and tuneups.
Opposition has been formidable, led by the goliath Ohio Hospital Association. It has filed a court injunction that is currently delaying enactment, peppered local news media with editorials, and lobbied Republican Gov. John Kasich, who has eliminated funding that would allow implementation from the latest state budget.
Joining the hospital association in its legal action are a wide range of provider groups including the Ohio State Medical Association, the Ohio Psychological Association, the Ohio Physical Therapy Association, and the Ohio chapters of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Surgeons, and the American Osteopathic Association.
These groups say that the law, which applies only to elective procedures, is too broad and that forcing providers to create estimates before procedures would slow down patient care. “The only way to even try to comply with the law is to delay care to patients in order to track down information from insurance companies, who may or may not provide the requested information,” wrote Mike Abrams, the president and CEO of the Ohio Hospital Association, in an op-ed in The Columbus Dispatch in January.
But Jerry Friedman, a retired health policy adviser for the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said the opposition doesn't stem from genuine concern about patients but from a desire to keep the secret rates that providers have negotiated with insurers under wraps. Transparency would mean explaining to consumers why the hospital charged them $1,000 for a test, they said, adding that providers “don't want to expose this house of cards they've built between hospital physician industry and the insurance industry.”
Said Butler on their quest to see the law enacted: “The health care industry has a lot of political power and lots of money. It's hard to fight on behalf of people against this kind of force.”
The law's next test will come in August, when the first court hearing on the association's lawsuit is scheduled. The Kasich administration said it couldn't comment on the law because of the pending litigation.
Greater price transparency has been a popular policy prescription for America's high health costs, especially at a time when many patients have high-deductible insurance plans and face larger copayments. Upfront estimates exist in other countries, such as Australia and, for patients facing out-of-pocket expenses, in France.
In Massachusetts, patients can get an estimate within two days of admission if they ask for it. Nebraska requires hospitals and surgical centers to provide a list of the average charges for services. New Hampshire has a website where consumers can compare costs.
Hospitals and doctors often oppose such measures. The American Hospital Association's position is that health plans — not hospitals — are responsible for telling insured patients about their out-of-pocket costs, according to its website.
Aimee Winteregg, 35, of Troy, Ohio, said they would have liked such information before five miscarriages in four years left them buried in unexpected medical bills. They and their husband became first-time parents in November. Though they are well insured, tests and treatment cost the couple $4,000 out-of-pocket, demanded in bills that were sometimes no more descriptive than for “medical service.”
“We don't want to deal with this, especially when the doctor tells you stress is bad for the pregnancy,” their husband, J.D., said. But imposing greater transparency has been controversial in both the medical industry and among some health care researchers, who say it puts patients in an untenable position.
The transparency law “was written by someone thinking about health care as a TV, and not as health care,” said Sandra Tanenbaum, a professor of health services management and policy at The Ohio State University College of Public Health.
They said people could not shop for procedures as they would for a TV or car repairs, since they often lack information on the quality of doctors and hospitals, and make health care decisions based on much more than cost.
Consumers are more likely to base their decisions on their doctors' advice, not on cost alone, according to a report from the Health Policy Institute of Ohio.
Only around 10 percent of health care costs are even “shoppable” expenses — procedures that can be scheduled in advance, like an MRI or elective surgery — according to the HPIO.
Regardless, Butler maintains, the health care industry can give consumers better information upfront. “If you really want patients to be empowered, they really need the information,” they said.
In support of such access, Butler has written letters to the Ohio Hospital Association, the Ohio attorney general and the Dayton Daily News, all in defense of the transparency law.
The Ohio Hospital Association, along with seven other Ohio health organizations, went to court last December to block the law, a month before it was supposed to take effect.
Butler said Gov. Kasich's administration is helping the hospital association stall by not writing regulations, eliminating funding for the law in the state budget, and declining to meet with Butler to discuss it.
State Rep. Michael Henne, also a Republican, has worked with Butler in the Ohio General Assembly on the transparency law. They called Butler a “driver” on the law, noting: “It's frustrating. You don't realize how much [influence] special interests have in the process.”
By enhancing police-worn bodycams with facial recognition technology, beat cops themselves could become citywide mass automated tracking tools. Ryan Johnson/North Charleston/Flickr
This article is part of Future Tense, a collaboration among Arizona State University, New America, and Slate. On Wednesday, Nov. 30, Future Tense will host an event in Washington, D.C., on the future of law enforcement technology. For more information and to RSVP, visit the New America website.
Imagine you're at a large protest, thousands of demonstrators gathered. Police stand nearby, tasked with protecting those speaking out and maintaining safety. At each officer's chest, a red light shows a body camera is recording, ensuring the officers do not engage in improper conduct. But what if that red light also meant a program was scanning, recording, and cataloging the face of every person in the crowd. Would you feel safe?
It would be a sad irony if police body cameras, brought into communities to check police power, became tools that improperly expanded it. But as they are rapidly being deployed in cities across the country, often without clear policies designed to protect privacy, we may be failing to fully consider the risks of pervasive surveillance these devices pose. And in addition to existing concerns, a huge new issue is rapidly approaching: body cameras that use facial recognition technology.
And body cameras that incorporate facial recognition technology are certainly on the horizon. This summer Taser International, by far the nation's biggest producer of police body cameras, announced plans to incorporate facial recognition technology into its cameras in the future. And so far, not a single city places adequate limits on its use. Even if these enhanced technologies don't lead to a world where “every cop will be RoboCop,” as Taser vice president Steve Tuttle once suggested, we need to talk about the real ways in which facial recognition devices could be used—and misused—and what limits should be put on their use.
Facial recognition works by creating and scanning for “face prints,” a unique biometric identification based on distinct facial features, such as the distance between the centers of an individual's eyes. Computer programs can scan photos or video to develop new face prints and can scan footage (including real-time footage) to identify individuals that match face prints in an existing database. Software on the market already claims to be capable of comparing millions of faces per second.
Law enforcement agencies have already begun using facial recognition to a significant degree. According to a recent report from the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology, 1 in 2 American adults are already in photo databases—including not just police records but also civilian databases like those belonging to state Departments of Motor Vehicles—that law enforcement uses for facial recognition. Furthermore, the report says, at least 1 in 4 of all state and local police departments have the ability to run face recognition searches through their or another agency's systems. Body cameras with built-in facial recognition capabilities could dramatically expand the ability to develop profiles and run scans, giving law enforcement unprecedented powers.
Consider that in cities like Chicago and Washington, D.C.—both of which already employ police body cameras—there are an average of 50 police officers per square mile. Such a tool could make the real-time lookout for dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of people relatively effortless.
So how might police departments use these tools?
The least controversial use of facial recognition would be to identify individuals in relation to emergencies—setting police cameras to scan the city for the face of a missing child or a suspect in an ongoing kidnapping during an Amber Alert, for example, or for an active shooter. It's hard to imagine persuasive objections to this specific use of the technology, since responding to an imminent threat is a commonly accepted exception to Fourth Amendment rules that generally require warrants for certain police action.
Law enforcement agencies might also use this biometric data to try to identify other fugitives at large in nonemergency situations—sending out face prints of individuals that have outstanding arrest warrants to body cameras, which could then scan police footage for chance matches. Such a system could take “Most Wanted” posters into the 21st century and help catch dangerous fugitives much more efficiently. The requirement of an active warrant would also give judicial oversight to the technology's deployment.
However, even here there are significant concerns. Facial recognition technology is known to misidentify individuals and is more prone to do so for minorities, as a U.S. Government Accountability Office study recently revealed. For police officers operating in real time, especially those authorized to use force, the cost of misidentification could be catastrophic. Without measures to reduce the risk of misidentification, the body cameras hailed as tools for reducing police abuse may cause it through different means.
And what kinds of accused offenders could this facial recognition trawl for? It's one thing to set body cameras to identify wanted violent offenders that come into view of body cameras; it's another to scan the streets for those accused of petty offenses. Many cities have sizable numbers of active arrest warrants for minor crimes. (For example, a Department of Justice investigation revealed that the municipal court in Ferguson, Missouri—population 21,000—had outstanding arrest warrants for 16,000 people in 2014, the vast majority for minor offenses like unpaid fines for traffic violations or overgrown grass. A judge has since withdrawn thousands.) Facial recognition software could give police officers unprecedented abilities to exercise “arrest at will” authority over a large proportion of the population. It's not hard to imagine how, without curbs on its use, police could abuse this power against protesters, minorities, or others an individual officer could have bias against.
Beyond ability to target anyone with an outstanding warrant, this technology could also offer a powerful new means for location tracking and monitoring of the entire public. Law enforcement agencies commonly use location tracking for investigations—following an individual in public, attaching GPS tracking devices to cars, or obtaining cellphone locations from telecommunications companies, for example. But each of these methods requires intensive resources or, with some methods, a warrant.
By enhancing police-worn body cameras with facial recognition technology, beat cops themselves could be turned into a citywide mass automated tracking tool. But without judicial oversight, location tracking will not necessarily be limited to suspected wrongdoers. Law enforcement could use the technology to identify, monitor, and intimidate individuals involved in nonillicit activities absent any judicial review or prior arrests.
Most disturbingly, this could occur not only by tracking an individual, but also by targeting sensitive locations or events. Think if police were able to review body camera footage and use facial recognition to catalog every participant in a protest or every person that walked into a local mosque. Facial recognition and body cameras could quickly create a much more powerful, digital version of J. Edgar Hoover's secret “enemies” lists.
This isn't exactly a reach—consider that, in recent years, law enforcement agencies have questionably used targeted surveillance operations to monitor Black Lives Matter demonstrators and Muslim communities. And it's not hard to imagine how this technological capability could be disastrous for civil liberties. Even the threat of such activity may have a devastating chilling effect, causing individuals to avoid public demonstrations or houses of worship out of fear that their faces could be recorded, scanned, identified, and cataloged. In the face of these risks, it's critical that we require judicial authorization for developing face prints before combining facial recognition technology with body cameras.
This dystopian future, of course, isn't inevitable. But in order to prevent it, we need to put smart checks in place before we give law enforcement such tools. From stingrays to spy planes, we are seeing the consequences of powerful surveillance technology creeping into local law enforcement without adequate limits. Police body cameras hold promise to help provide oversight and build much-needed community trust. But let's make sure they, especially with the enhanced capabilities of facial recognition software, don't just become another potential means for police abuse.
Hume and the Deconstruction of Epistemology
|||Hume, David. An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding Edited, with Introduction, by Eric Steinberg. Indianapolis: Hackett Pub. Co, 1993.|||
We have sought in vain for an idea of power or necessary connexion, in all the sources from which we could suppose it to be derived. It appears, that, in single instances of the operation of bodies, we never can, by our utmost scrutiny, discover but one event following another; without being able to comprehend any force or power by which the cause operates, or any connexion between it and its supposed effect. The same difficulty occurs in contemplating the operations of mind on body; where we observe the motion of the latter to follow upon the volition of the former; but are not able to observe or conceive the tie, which binds together the motion and volition, or the energy by which the mind produces this effect. The authority of the will over its own faculties and ideas is not a whit more comprehensible. So that, upon the whole, there appears not, throughout all nature, any one instance of connexion, which is conceivable by us. All events seem entirely loose and separate. p. 49.
In a previous article, we discussed the view of Plotinus on the union of intellect with the objects of intellect. This becomes an increasingly important topic of debate after the 16th century, when certain key questions about the nature of knowledge and the process of learning are introduced. In their “Meditations” Rene Descartes divides all Being into two distinct categories: res cogitans (thinking thing) and res extensa.. In doing this, they set the template for almost all epistemological investigation that proceed from their initial inquiry. Though there were many different currents of thought that occurred in the three centuries that followed, in general most philosophers tended to emphasize one of the two at the expense of the other. On the one hand are rationalists who stress the primacy of clear and distinct ideas in the acquisition and verification of knowledge. On the other hand are the empiricists, who contrapuntally emphasize the reflexive and self-evident nature of the objects of the senses, and make this the foundation of all knowledge and learning.
The first empiricist was an Englishman named John Locke, who shook the world of epistemology from its rationalist foundations with their Essay Concerning Human Understanding. Sense impressions, they argued, were the sole basis for all knowledge.. This system, interestingly enough, included notions such as necessary powers of various substances. They argued that sense impressions, aggregated over time in a variety of circumstances, eventually coalesced into certain complex ideas such as powers inherent in a substance. Simply put, if one event was observed to follow from another a sufficient number of times, one could justifiably state that the two events are the result of a power of the substance.
It is precisely this notion that David Hume successfully critiqued in their “Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding”, and it is hard to argue against their conclusions if one assumes the premises of empiricism. At first glance, Locke's notion of complex ideas resulting from the concatenation of simple sense impressions stored in the memory seems unassailable. Indeed, Hume has often been unjustly accused of being a pure skeptic by those who misunderstand that as their true target. Their objection is not directed towards causality per se, but rather the idea of necessary connexion, which as noted above they seem to be inferred by sentiment and habit rather than any mental or extra-mental source. With this critique, however, they inadvertently created the philosophical assumptions that were to drive the creation and progress of the statistical sciences in the next century. The realization that certain effects proceeded from certain causes through a set of conditions that were (at least at the time) unknown led to the investigation of those conditions in the physical sciences. Although it is highly unlikely that they intended this, Hume's enquiry had the effect of encouraging a new way of investigating nature that was quantitative and probabilistic rather than qualitative and necessary.
Qualitative and quantitative data, furthermore, are not as opposed as one might initially think. As has been pointed out many times, Hume does not arrive at their conclusions through an empirical approach. Their epistemological system rests upon a number of metaphysical assumptions (the intelligible nature of Being, the objectivity of the senses, etc.) that are inherently qualitative in method. It is all well and good to think that the sun shines because that is its essence, but it becomes a hindrance to knowledge if it prevents one from probing further into understanding the nature of nuclear fusion. It is perfectly reasonable to suggest that if one wants the fullest possible notion of the sun, one would need to know both of these things. Thus Hume, while attempting to deconstruct the philosophy of knowledge, inadvertently provided one of its greatest supports by introducing the serious investigation of the conditions of substances.

Dog owners of the midwest, beware: there's a deadly disease striking dogs, and it may be spreading to them by their owners. Flu-like symptoms may be present, and can be fatal within 12-24 hours of contracting it.
Cases of the virus similar to circovirus (typically associated with pigs) have been reported all across Ohio, and now six Michigan dogs have died from it. There is no name for the mysterious illness, because veterinarians and scientists aren't exactly sure what it is yet.
“The laboratory confirmation is important because the virus is newly isolated, however we are not prepared at this time to confirm that canine circovirus is the cause of the dog illnesses,” said State Veterinarian Dr. Tony Forshey. “Because the symptoms being exhibited can also be linked to other known illnesses, additional analysis and information is needed to determine if this virus alone or in co-infection contributes to illness and death in dogs.”
Symptoms can include lethargy, abdominal pain, lack of appetite, and most notably, vomiting and bloody diarrhea. Dogs displaying these symptoms should be rushed to a vet, especially if someone they've been in close contact with is also under the weather. Dogs can be saved, but only if they are treated immediately.
“Usually within about 12 to 24 hours of it starting,” said Dr. Lindsay Ruland of the Emergency Veterinary Hospital in Ann Arbor.
It is unknown how the virus is transmitted, but it may be spreading through saliva and feces. No humans or other animals are believed to have died from the virus, but doctors are recommending that people wash their hands thoroughly with antibacterial soap and hot water before and after touching their pets and their pets' food, bedding, toys, etc. For the time, none of these items should be shared between animals, especially if people around them have had flu-like symptoms, and contact between dogs should be limited, or avoided altogether if it is known that a dog (or its human) has been sick recently.
“Traditionally we don't pass viruses to our pets. This year, I think that there is potential that we are passing it to our pets,” Dr. Ruland said.
Cut Copy have announced their upcoming record Haiku From Zero. It's out September 22 via Astralwerks. They've also shared a new song, “Standing in the Middle of the Field.” Listen below. A 7” copy of the track, backed by an exclusive B-side, will come with a Haiku From Zero vinyl preorder. “So much of this album is about this mosaic of information, images that we're surrounded by on a day-to-day basis,” Dan Whitford said in a statement. “Sometimes it feels like overload, but there's a weird random beauty in it. The idea of squeezing poetry form chaos was where the title of the album came from—the idea of finding something poetic in the overload.”
Cut Copy previously shared another Haiku From Zero song called “Airborne,” and later, they unveiled its accompanying music video. The band's last studio album was 2013's Free Your Mind. They've released a number of mixes since: 2014's DJ mix Oceans Apart, 2015's Forest Through the Trees, and 2016's ambient cassette January Tape. Cut Copy have also announced a North American tour.

CARACAS, Venezuela (CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's detractors danced in the streets Monday after voters shot down a referendum that would have allowed the firebrand leftist to seek re-election indefinitely and tightened socialism's grip on their oil-rich nation.
President Hugo Chavez thanks opponents Monday, saying the results show Venezuelan democracy is maturing. more photos »
In Caracas, Valencia, Maracaibo and other major cities, large crowds spilled into the streets, shouting, chanting, clapping and waving flags. One man carried a sign proclaiming, "Vota No," which by Monday was more an exclamation than an imperative after voters the day before dismissed 69 proposed amendments to Venezuela's 1999 constitution.
Chavez said Monday they accepted the vote, calling the slim margin of victory -- 51 percent to 49 percent, according to early reports -- a "photo finish."
The vote represented a rare poll defeat for Chavez, who has generally enjoyed popular support among the lower classes. Among the exceptions: a bitter national strike, an abortive coup against them in 2002 and a 2004 attempt to recall them as president, a vote they easily survived.
Many of Monday's revelers were university students who had worked doggedly to defeat the proposals. They burst into singing the national anthem upon hearing news that their efforts paid off.
"This is not a moment only for students; it is for the whole country," student Juan Andres Mejia said. "It's time for us to start walking the same path to walking together, and I think this day could be the start of a new republic of a new Venezuela." Watch what led to the referendum's defeat »
In Washington, the White House applauded the results of the vote.
"We congratulate the people of Venezuela on their vote and their continued desire to live in freedom and democracy," said National Security Council spokesperson Gordon Johndroe.
In what they called a talk "from my heart," Chavez said the election results proved Venezuelan democracy was maturing, a sentiment echoed by Tibisay Lucena, president of the National Electoral Council.
Thanking their opponents, Chavez told a roomful of supporters and journalists, "Now Venezuelans should have faith in our institutions." View scenes from the historic election »
However, Chavez promised to continue their pursuit of the defeated proposals.
"Not a single comma of this proposal will be withdrawn," they said, holding up a small red book containing the text of the proposed changes. "I will continue proposing this to the Venezuelan people. The proposal is alive, not dead."
One of the more controversial proposed amendments would have abolished term limits, allowing Chavez to hold office indefinitely as long as they are re-elected.
The 53-year-old Venezuelan president, who was elected in 1998 as the country's youngest-ever president, has twice been re-elected by large margins. However, the present law prohibits Chavez from seeking re-election when their term ends in 2012.
Another amendment on the ballot would have pushed the country more toward socialism. Chavez has said they should have full authority over the autonomous Central Bank as well as the nation's economic policy. These measures, Chavez has said, are necessary to move the economy toward socialism.
Since winning a second six-year term in December, Chavez has promised to push forward with their particular brand of socialism and their "Bolivarian Revolution."
Chavez has used skyrocketing oil revenues, which reportedly account for about 90 percent of the nation's export earnings, to garner support in the country's poorer neighborhoods.
In Venezuela, the poor reception free health care and education, much like in Cuba, which is under the rule of Chavez's friend and mentor, President Fidel Castro.
Chavez's opponents say they have undercut Venezuela's democracy by systematically concentrating power in their own hands.
In the last year, Chavez has nationalized oil, telephone and power companies and refused to renew the broadcast license for RCTV, an independent open-air television station that had been broadcasting for 53 years.
The Venezuelan government later threatened to investigate broadcasters it said were inciting the public to violence over the decision. RCTV returned as a cable and satellite broadcaster in July.
On Friday, Chavez threatened to take independent Venezuelan network Globovision off the air if it broadcast partial results of the Sunday referendum.
Chavez, a former paratrooper, also routinely lambastes the United States, which has had thin diplomatic but close economic ties with Venezuela. The United States is Venezuela's top oil customer, buying about 1 million barrels a day, and is one of the few countries that can refine its low-quality crude. E-mail to a friend

Protesters have planned a demonstration in front of the Anaheim police station Sunday, a day after officers shot and killed a man, prompting an angry crowd to throw bottles at police and set fires on the street.
The demonstration is planned for noon, organizer Theresa Smith told the Orange County Register.
"[The Anaheim police] are not judge, jury and executioner," Smith told the newspaper. "Nobody is given their due process and it just seems like everything has gotten out of hand."
The melee broke out Saturday night, hours after police fatally shot a man. Anaheim Police Sgt. Bob Dunn said the incident began when two patrol officers tried to approach three men in an alley in the 600 block of North Anna Drive about 4 p.m.
It was unclear why the officers first approached the men, but Dunn said they gave chase and one of the officers followed one of the men to the front of an apartment complex, where the shooting occurred.
The man was taken to a hospital, where they died about 7 p.m., authorities said.
Police remained at the scene to investigate the shooting, Dunn said, and were encircled by a group of people who began throwing things, including bottles and possibly rocks, at the officers. Police then used non-lethal rounds and pepper balls on the crowd.
A police dog also somehow got free from an officer's car and charged at several people before it was pulled back, Dunn said.
Dunn said more details about the incident — including a tally on the number of those detained or injured — would be available at a news conference scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Sunday.
The name of the man killed has not been released by authorities, but 16-year-old Daisy Gonzalez told the Register the victim was their uncle, Manuel Diaz.
"He [doesn't] like cops. They never liked them because all they do is harass and arrest anyone," Gonzalez told the newspaper after lighting a candle for their uncle, cursing nearby police and a helicopter that hovered above.
Last month, city officials announced an independent review would be conducted into what were described as "major police incidents," the Register reported. The inquiry came on the heels of weekly protests outside the police station, led by relatives of those killed in officer-involved shootings.
Prior to Saturday's incident, the most recent fatal shootings involving Anaheim police happened in January, the newspaper said.

Muhammad Raped while Bobby Stayed Mum
The cult of diversity has claimed four dozen more victims. On May 8, 2012, nine men were convicted of rape, conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with minors, trafficking for sexual exploitation, conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with children, sexual assault, and aiding and abetting a rape. All nine of the men are Muslim, eight are British Pakistani, and one is Afghani. The gruesome details of the crime are in themselves barbaric, but the responses from British police are languid and discomfiting. The national scandal began in 2005 as the nine men in the Manchester area, some of them taxi drivers, would lure many young teenage girls, often 13 to 15 years old, with free food, drugs, and alcohol. The girls came from shoddy backgrounds; many were teenage runaways and living on social services. Once they were high or drunk, they were beaten and raped. They were passed around to other men, mostly of Pakistani descent, where they would be gang-raped by three to five men a night. One case involved a 13-year-old who became pregnant after they were gang-raped by three men. And yet another disgusting incident involved a 15-year-old who was so drunk that they threw up off the side of the bed while two Pakistani men raped them Another involved a 15-year-old who was gang-raped by 20 men in one night.
The Telegraph stated, "There were 631 documented cases of abuse over a five-year period, and many will have been too afraid to tell their story." The nine men were between the ages of 22 and 59. One of the men, Abdul Rauf, a married father of five, also happens to be a religious studies teacher at a local mosque. The men received a total prison sentence of 77 years. The rapes are a tragedy -- it is a tragedy that vulnerable girls can be so easily abducted, raped, and abused. However, it is the delayed response by police and civil service in the area that is the national scandal. In August of 2008, one of the victims, then 15 years old, went to police and social workers; they provided the police with DNA evidence to back up their story of being gang-raped. Twice the police refused to prosecute. They continued to be raped by up to five men a night, four or five nights a week. Former Labour MP Ann Cryer said the silence of the Manchester Bobbies is due to the fact that they were "petrified of being called racists." The Manchester police and Rochdale social services publicly apologized, but their fears of being given the scarlet "R" were not in vain. The accusation of racism can end public servants' careers, so oftentimes they must revert to political correctness. Political correctness was also the fallback for most of the politicians in the House of Commons. Leading MP Keith Vaz stated that the gang-rapes were "appalling" but that it was important not to "stigmatize an entire community." They later stated, "I don't think this has anything to do with race." However, Equalities and Human Rights Commission chief Trevor Phillips said, "I think anybody who says that the fact that most of the men are Asian and most of the children are white is not relevant, I mean that's just fatuous." Nazir Afzal, the chief crown prosecutor, who themselves is a Muslim, stated that some immigrants bring "cultural baggage" with them from misogynistic societies. The link between the crime and the girls' race is undeniable according to top officials in the Human Rights Commission, and yet most media outlets outside the U.K. still ignore the case. Had roles been reversed and it were twenty white men gang-raping a Muslim woman, the international media would not rest until there was blood in the streets. The hype of the Trayvon Martin murder is simply ignored when the victims cannot produce the narrative most multiculturalists in the mainstream media wish to project. It is a sad day for Great Britain on the whole, not just for their victimized daughters -- for the nation which at one point had an empire so large that the sun never set on it has now been reduced to a nation of cowards. If a nation cannot perform its most basic obligation to protect its citizenry because its leaders prioritize protecting their multicultural ideology, that nation and its culture are dead. In the West, theological faith has given way to political religion -- a religion predicated upon self-deception and self-destruction, a religion, which may yet be proven to be as fatal for the West as it has so callously negligent toward these young girls. If Western civilization and all the fruit it has borne are to survive this seeming twilight, then both the ideology of multiculturalism and the cult of diversity must be defeated.

The gap between official test results for CO2 emissions/fuel economy and real-world performance has increased to 40% on average in 2014 from 8% in 2001, according to T&E's 2015 Mind the Gap report, which analyses on-the-road fuel consumption by motorists and highlights the abuses by carmakers of the current tests and the failure of EU regulators to close loopholes. T&E said the gap has become a chasm and, without action, will likely grow to 50% on average by 2020.
By exploiting loopholes in the test procedure (including known differences between real-world driving and lab simulations) conventional cars can emit up to 40-45% more CO2 emissions on the road than what is measured in the lab. But the average gap between test results and real-world driving is more than 50% for some models. Mercedes cars have an average gap between test and real-world performance of 48% and their new A, C and E class models have a difference of over 50%. The BMW 5 series and Peugeot 308 are just below 50%. The causes of these big deviations have to be clarified as soon as possible.
Greg Archer, clean vehicles manager at T&E, said: “Like the air pollution test, the European system of testing cars to measure fuel economy and CO 2 emissions is utterly discredited. The Volkswagen scandal was just the tip of the iceberg and what lies beneath is widespread abuse by carmakers of testing rules enabling cars to swallow more than 50% more fuel than is claimed.”
The distorted laboratory tests are costing a typical motorist €450 a year in additional fuel costs compared to what carmakers' marketing materials claim, the report finds. But the car manufacturers are continuing to try to delay the introduction of a new test (WLTP) to be introduced in 2017.
Misleading drivers, cheating the law
On average, two-thirds of the claimed gains in CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption since 2008 have been delivered through manipulating tests with only 13.3 g/km of real progress on the roads set against 22.2 g/km of ‘hot air', according to the report. This means that in the last three years there has been no improvement in fuel economy from new vehicles on the road. Only Toyota would have met its 2015 target without exploiting test flexibilities whereas all the other major carmakers have met their legal limits through exploiting test loopholes.
Greg Archer concluded: “This widening gap casts more doubt on how carmakers trick their customers in Europe to produce much better fuel efficiency in tests than can be achieved on the road. The only solution is a comprehensive investigation into both air pollution and fuel economy tests and all car manufacturers to identify whether unfair and illegal practices, like defeat devices, may be in use. There must also be a comprehensive overhaul of the testing system.”
Cars are responsible for 15% of Europe's total CO2 emissions and are the single largest source of emissions in the transport sector. The EU's first obligatory rules on carbon emissions require car manufacturers to limit their average car to a maximum of 130 grams of CO2 per km by 2015, and 95g by 2021.
CLOSE New Asheville homeowner Art Chwalek discusses what it took to buy a home in west Asheville January 11, 2017. Angela Wilhelm/awilhelm@citizentimes.com

When it comes to buying a house in Buncombe County, they who waits will likely lose the deal.
The market set records in numerous categories in 2016, including the number of homes sold (4,226), the average selling price ($311,386) and average asking price, which climbed to $615,498. Homes also averaged 62 days on the market before selling, but that overall figure does not take into account super-hot areas such as West Asheville, where homes can easily sell the day they're listed.
Art Chwalek, an Ohio native who moved to West Asheville last year after a year in Chicago, knows all about waiting too long to make an offer. With their real estate agent, they found a condo in Black Mountain they really liked, drove out to check it out and came home that evening planning to read the homeowners' association bylaws.
"I started reviewing those that night, and my agent called me that night and said it was gone," Chwalek said. "I don't think I even got the full read of the bylaws done and it was gone. The agent told me later that the person who bought it had bought it sight unseen after they saw it on the internet. They liked it enough just from that (virtual tour), and they never toured that property at all in person."
Chwalek had a few other homes slip through their fingers in similar fashion, even one or two that were listed and sold on the same day. Ultimately, they bought a home in West Asheville the same day they first toured it.
It's a 1,200-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-bath "shotgun" type house that was built four years ago. They paid about $300,000, and he's happy to have signed on the dotted line.

Their real estate agent, Tom Haskin of The Buyer's Agent of Asheville, said they had their best year in a decade. While the market is great for sellers, it's tough for buyers, and...
"I don't see any sign of it slowing down," Haskin said. "It's that simple economics thing — very high demand and very low inventory."
In Chwalek's case, they and Haskin looked "for months and months," as Haskin said, and it's not like Chwalek, a single 57-year-old who works as an information technology consultant, is super picky.
"He's a single man with not a lot of needs, but really finding something that was workable was still really challenging," Haskin said. "He bought a house within hours of looking at it, and that was a common theme of all the agents I talked to last year."
Don Davies, who compiled that year-end report on real estate sales, is the founder of Realsearch, a company that crunches local real estate statistics and analyzes trends. Their statistics go back to 1990.
"We set just about every kind of record you can think of for this year just passed," Davies said, noting the number of home sales made in Buncombe for 2016 (4,226) eclipsed the previous record of 4,120 set in 2006, two years before the Great Recession and real estate bust hit.
"The interesting part is it's the lowest inventory of existing homes for sales that we've had in 16 years, too," Davies said. "As of the end of December, we had 1,128 houses on the market — that's in the whole county."
That average asking price of $615,498 is particularly telling, mainly because it has historically been driven up by a large number of million-dollar-plus homes on the market.
"We're not skewing the average asking price now," Davies said. "We only have 144 homes over $1 million on the market, and that's been running as many as 250. It's just the overall market has increased, and the value of the housing has increased, and every area has increased."

Tough market for locals
While that's good news for those in the business, and the local economy that benefits from well-heeled folks moving here who spend a lot of money, it's not great for local working folks.
"As good as it is right now, the thing that concerns me is everything is 'record this' and 'record that,' and I'm worried that Asheville is reaching that too-popular point," Haskin said. "I had several clients this year who were in the $250,000 and below range (for a house), and they just went away after awhile -- they just could not find a house in that range."
Davies said part of what's driving the price surge goes back to that simple lack of inventory, and a lag in builders constructing and selling new homes.
"With new home sales, the year we set a record with that was 2006, when we sold 916 homes that were brand new in Buncombe — that's homes condos and town houses," Davies said. "This (past) year, we sold 427. That give you some comparison. We set records in every other category, except new homes sales. But they have been increasing a little bit, on average, over the last five years."
New home sales have been strong for Beverly-Hanks, one of the largest real estate sales companies in the mountains. With 310 agents in six offices, the company does "a little over $1.2 billion in sales" annually, and 2016 was a banner year, according to company President Neal Hanks.
"It'll be our best year to date, and we just celebrated our 40th year in business," Hanks said.
Hank agrees with Davies that many of the buyers are coming from other markets, particularly those up north or Florida, where their homes have accumulated a lot of value and, despite what locals consider high prices here, they can still get a lot of houses for the money. While all sales dried up after the recession, and investors buying lots or homes to flip also disappeared, those wanting to move to the mountains for the quality of life has resurged.
"It's the same profile that we've seen for decades -- quality of life moves: people who want to live here, either pre-retirement or early retirement, or a job lets them live where they want to live," Hanks said. "The buyer profile really hasn't changed that much."
While million-dollar homes were a dime a dozen before the crash, that's a lot less common now. Hanks said what they're seeing now is buyers looking for smaller, well-appointed homes at $300,000 and up. That means that sub-$300,000 market is "very tight," Hanks said.
"What we're seeing is people moving up to the $300,000-700,000 range is really kind of the sweet spot now," Hanks said.
Beverly-Hanks year-end report found 1,011 homes on the market in Buncombe County at the end of 2016, with 31 under $100,000 and 128 in the $100,000-$199,000 range. While 220 homes in the $200,000-$299,000 range were available, competition for them was fierce.
In that $300,000-$700,000 sweet spot, 399 homes were available.
One small positive sign that might indicate some relief for homebuyers in the sub-$300,000 market is land sales, which Davies said "have been pathetic" for more than five years.
"This last year started setting records on land sales," Davies said, referring to the transactions totals. "It looks like people can't find what they want, so they're saying, 'OK, I'll go ahead and build.'" So we're just starting to see a little bit of speculators."
Before the recession, a lot of builders would erect homes or subdivisions "on spec," meaning they did not have buyers yet. But after the crash, banks stopped loaning money for that activity.
For Chwalek, they knew when they moved to Asheville that the market would be hot, but they were surprised at the dearth of homes available in Asheville that were under $200,000 and didn't need a lot of work. They also learned the hard way not to hesitate.
"Yeah, I'd say time is of the essence," Chwalek said when asked what advice he'd give house hunters. "Either you or your real estate agent, or both of you, need to stay up on what listing came out today, and have the flexibility to go see it that day if you can."

Johnny Louis via Getty Images Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump called on their rivals to disavow their support from super PACs and other outside groups.
WASHINGTON -- Billionaire eccentric and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday called on all presidential candidates to disavow support they receive from super PACs.
In a series of tweets, Trump called the unlimited-money super PACs a “scam” and wrote, “All Presidential candidates should immediately disavow their Super PAC's. They're not only breaking the spirit of the law but the law itself.”
Re Super PAC scam: What the other candidates are doing is a disgrace. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 26, 2015
All Presidential candidates should immediately disavow their Super PAC's. They're not only breaking the spirit of the law but the law itself — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 26, 2015
Every Republican presidential candidate has received support from a super PAC or a non-disclosing nonprofit. For most of the candidates, their super PAC has raised more money than their actual campaign.
Trump had super PACs backing them until Friday, when they disavowed all super PACs formed to support their candidacy. This move came days after a pro-Trump super PAC shut down after The Washington Post reported on its close connection to the Trump campaign.
Super PACs were created in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision and a subsequent lower court ruling -- SpeechNow.org v. Federal Election Commission -- opened the door to unlimited election spending by corporations, unions and wealthy individuals so long as it remained independent from candidates.
The independence imagined by the court, however, is riddled with loopholes that have increasingly allowed candidates to help create, raise money for, staff and influence super PACs supporting them with relative ease.
Republican presidential candidates including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former candidate Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin all pretended to not be running for president to evade laws prohibiting them from coordinating with their super PACs.
This evasion enabled Bush to raise $100 million for their Right to Rise super PAC directly from wealthy donors and corporations. Many of these big donors have lobbying interests in Washington.
Jindal was able to raise millions for a super PAC, a 527 and a nonprofit supporting their campaign. The majority of the disclosed money to the super PAC and 527 came from donors who have benefited from Jindal's administration or who still have business before him. Donors to Jindal's nonprofit are not disclosed -- a practice known as “dark money.”
Kasich not only raised money for and coordinated directly with their super PAC almost up to the moment they announced their candidacy, but they also cut advertisements for it. Candidates are technically legally prohibited from making advertisements with super PACs.
Mike Murphy, the head of Bush's Right to Rise super PAC, criticized Kasich's appearance in super PAC ads in an interview with Bloomberg. “We're far more conservative than the Kasich people; they're doing stuff our lawyers would never allow, so but it's open to interpretation,” Murphy said.
Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina is leaning heavily on their super PAC to manage many of the day-to-day tasks of a normal campaign. The group does advance work on their public appearances, has hosted conference calls for them and does a lot of the communications work normally done by a traditional campaign.
The other candidates are all boosted by outside groups as well. A quartet of super PACs backing Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) raised a combined $38.6 million. Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) is backed by a super PAC that raised $17.3 million and a dark money nonprofit that has reportedly raised more than $18 million in undisclosed donations. A super PAC supporting New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has pulled in $14.4 million. (All totals are from January through June.)
Trump's declaration that the super PACs used by these candidates are illegal may not be so far-fetched. Campaign finance reform advocates Democracy 21 and Campaign Legal Center have already asked the Department of Justice to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Bush's relationship with their super PAC.
Democracy 21 and Campaign Legal Center allege that Bush is in violation of a provision of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (popularly known as McCain-Feingold) that bans outside groups from acting on a candidate's behalf if said group was created by or with the help of the candidate and the group raised money above the candidate donation limit of $5,400 per donor.
“[T]here are powerful grounds to believe that both Bush and the Right to Rise Super PAC are violating these prohibitions and, in so doing, that they are engaged in a scheme to allow unlimited contributions to be spent directly on behalf of the Bush campaign and thereby violate the candidate contribution limits enacted to prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption,” the legal request by the two groups states.
Despite their protestations of independence from big money, campaign finance reformers do not see Trump as a fix for the money-in-politics problem.
According to Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer, Trump's self-funded campaign is just another example of a broken system and their attacks on big money are just self-interested politics.
Simon Coveney and four of their siblings were on a Kennedyesque round-the-world sailing trip in March 1998, when terrible news from home changed their lives.
Having crossed the Atlantic in the family yacht Golden Apple, the Coveneys had reached the Galápagos Islands in the Pacific. Sporadic satellite communications allowed limited access to email, and a number of messages to the boat urged them to make contact with Cork as soon as possible.
The eldest sibling on board and skipper Simon Coveney, then 25, found a pay phone on San Christóbal, the easternmost of the Galápagos. They reversed the charges on a call to Minane Bridge, and learned of the death of their father, Hugh.
The former Fine Gael minister and serving TD had fallen from a cliff at Robert's Cove in Cork Harbour as they attempted to rescue one of their dogs during a walk.
Simon Coveney put down the phone in shock, and then had to find the words to break the news to their younger brothers and sister.
The Coveneys had to pay a flying doctor to get them to South America. The journey home on commercial flights through Atlanta and New York was a blur. Within two days they were reunited with their mother Pauline, the youngest brother David, then only 15, and eldest sibling Patrick, now chief executive of Greencore.
Privileged youth
The same words come up again and again from those in Coveney's corner when describing the man they want to see as Fine Gael leader and taoiseach: sincere, decent, genuine and honest.
The most enthusiastic cast the 44-year-old as an ideological successor to Garret FitzGerald, determined to reform Irish society after years of focus on the economy.
Some supporters also speak approvingly of Coveney as a “family man”.
Cork being a small place, Coveney first encountered their future wife Ruth Furney when they were at school. They had friends who were friends. Their paths crossed again in college, and they started going out.
They went their separate ways for a time, but married in 2008, when Coveney was 35, and now have three daughters aged seven, six and four. Furney works for IDA Ireland.
The extended Coveney family remains tight-knit. When Pauline Coveney remarried in 2001, Simon said the family was very pleased their mother had another chance at happiness with Dr Paul McCarthy.
Coveney will struggle to shake off the “merchant prince” tag, and there is a lingering sense that the somewhat reserved candidate does not have the “X-factor” enjoyed by rival Leo Varadkar, who also has the perceived benefit of a Dublin base.
Rent strategy
Appointed Minister for Housing last year, they have been celebrated within Fine Gael for facing down Fianna Fáil on water charges and rent strategy. Yet in pledging an end to hotel accommodation for homeless families by July, they are viewed as having set themselves up for a fall.
Their conservative views on same-sex marriage changed over the years, and they became a leading voice calling for a Yes vote as their party's director of elections in the 2015 referendum.
On abortion, they recently professed themselves “uncomfortable” with some of the proposals made by the Citizens' Assembly.
A TD for 18 years now, Coveney has a tendency towards earnest long-windedness in media appearances.
Strange as it may seem, a speech impediment meant they struggled to string sentences together in their early teenage years. Reading out loud in class proved impossible because of their stutter, and they were often passed over by teachers.
Their concerned parents tried everything to help them find ways of coping. All sorts of methods from hypnosis to singing instead of speaking were experimented with, but they eventually worked out how to deal with the stutter himself.
With time and practice they learned to think ahead while speaking, and employs a vocabulary that allows them to articulate themselves with greater ease. When they come across youngsters in schools who stammer they try to make time to talk to them about their experience.
The young Coveney was expelled from the prestigious fee-paying Clongowes Wood boarding school in Co Kildare temporarily following a transition-year spell of drinking and partying.
They were suspended after school authorities caught them under the influence of alcohol. They later left the school to attend a party in Dublin, which proved a flop, and was expelled. While they were asked back again, their formidable father did not appreciate their teenage antics. Their mother was more forgiving.
Unsure of what they wanted to do after school, Coveney began an arts degree in University College Cork (UCC) in 1993, studying economics, history, sociology and psychology.
The family farm was being run by a contractor, but Coveney saw a chance to be their own boss. Eyebrows were raised when they left UCC after a year, intending to return, and went to Tipperary to Gurteen Agricultural College, where Ivan Yates also studied.
They had never driven a tractor in their life, but was suddenly surrounded by students who had practically grown up on them.
Coveney went on to complete a BSc in agriculture and land management at Royal Agricultural University in Gloucestershire, before working in Edinburgh as an agriculture adviser.
Aged 24, they returned to work as a farm manager near Mallow. They spent a year in the post, before the prospect of getting involved in the family's charity sailing adventure, in aid of the Chernobyl Children's Project, prompted wanderlust.
Opposition politics
After their father's death they won the October 1998 byelection to fill their late father's Dáil seat. They also served as a member of Cork County Council from 1999 until 2003.
Finding the negative slog of domestic opposition politics unappealing, Coveney seized the chance to run for the European Parliament in 2004.
They found Brussels a more constructive environment, but after three years they gave up the European post to contest the general election when the dual mandate arrangement ended in 2007.
They were clearly not Enda Kenny's greatest fan, saying publicly the Mayo man needed to up their game.
Richard Bruton propelled Fine Gael into an abortive heave in June 2010 when they told Vincent Browne: “In the swag bag of every corporal is a lieutenant's baton.” Despite having backed Bruton, Coveney survived a reshuffle to remain on the party front bench.
After dropping one of their daughters to a creche on September 14th, 2010, Coveney observed on Twitter within minutes of then taoiseach Brian Cowen's disastrous Morning Ireland interview that the Fianna Fáil leader sounded “halfway between drunk and hungover and totally disinterested”.
They had a relatively small number of Twitter followers at the time, and did not foresee the political explosion their candid message would unleash.
After the 2011 general election, Coveney's appointment as minister for agriculture saw them become a front-rank politician, although naturally not all farmers agreed.
Defence was added to their portfolio, and they sent Naval Service ships to help rescue refugees in the Mediterranean.
Cork's best-known merchant prince, the late Peter Barry, never quite made the political summit, and was subsequently ranked by many as the greatest leader Fine Gael never had. Those around Coveney are hoping that history will not repeat itself.

Shock exit for the Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz director, who has been involved in project since 2006, with an announcement late in the preproduction stages
Director Edgar Wright has abruptly parted ways with Marvel Studios after years of work on the upcoming film Ant-Man, the studio announced Friday.
It is a startling break-up. Wright had been working on Ant-Man since 2006. They co-wrote the Ant-Man screenplay and also is listed as a co-producer.
The British director, whose credits include Hot Fuzz and the zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead, did not appear to retain any role in the Ant-Man project.

“Marvel and Edgar Wright jointly announced today that the studio and director have parted ways on Ant-Man due to differences in their vision of the film,” a statement issued by the studio read. “The decision to move on is amicable and does not impact the release date on July 17, 2015. A new director will be announced shortly.”
Ant-Man had attracted an A-list cast, including Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas and Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. Variety reported that a new director had been chosen but not yet publicly named.
The Ant-Man project appeared set to elevate Wright to a much larger stage. Marvel Entertainment has generated a string of film hits based on stories from its comic books franchise, including Captain America, Thor, X-Men, Wolverine and the Amazing Spider-Man.
Ant-Man tells the story of a scientist who develops a power to control insects.

The Secret Service says people attending the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this July will not be allowed to carry guns.
The statement comes in response to a petition that calls for allowing open carry of guns inside Quicken Loans Arena, the host venue.

The petition has amassed more than 43,000 signatures as of Monday morning.
Secret Service spokesperson Robert Hoback said in a statement that “only authorized law enforcement personnel” working with the agency will be allowed to carry firearms inside protected areas.
“Individuals determined to be carrying firearms will not be allowed past a predetermined outer perimeter checkpoint, regardless of whether they possess a ticket to the event,” Hoback wrote in an email.
The Secret Service cited federal law that allows the agency to prevent firearms from being carried into venues with protectees present, even in open-carry states.
The Secret Service previously sent a statement to Cleveland's Newsnet5.com.
The petition, which was posted last week on Change.org, has drawn widespread attention, in large part because it seemed designed to test the limits of the Republican Party's support for the Second Amendment.
The anonymous author noted that, while Ohio is an open-carry state, Quicken Loans Arena policy forbids weapons of any kind to be carried into the facility.
“This is a direct affront to the Second Amendment and puts all attendees at risk,” the petition reads.
The origins of the petition are murky, and some websites have questioned whether it is satire or a hoax.
An anonymous blogger, Hyperationalist, posted the petition on Change.org.
“Yesterday morning, the dedicated staff of the Hyperationalist launched the Change.org petition posted below,” the blog wrote last Thursday. “We have since collected 1,500 signatures and the pace seems to be picking up. Clearly we have struck a nerve.”
Chris Matyszczyk of Cnet referred to the petition as “satirical” in a Monday morning piece.
A Twitter account linked to the blog retweeted several messages calling the petition “Wizard-level” and “God-tier” trolling.
“Win-win for the Trump people at last night's rally: a protester got beat up and a black guy got arrested. #TrumpRally #NeverTrump” the user tweeted on March 20.

Regardless of its origins, the petition has won attention.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), who was named in the petition, also said Secret Service should be responisble for setting gun policy at the convention.
The Republican National Committee deferred questions about venue security to the Secret Service, which is coordinating with federal, state and local law enforcement to secure the convention site.
“The Republican Party has been and will continue to be a staunch supporter of the Second amendment,” said convention spokesperson Kirsten Kukowski. “It is in our platform and is strongly supported by our candidates.
“The Republican National Convention is a National Special Security Event which means the Secret Service is the lead agency and we will defer to their planning as it relates to safety and security of the convention.”

HYANNIS, Mass. (AP) - Police say masked and armed men in Cape Cod thought they were nabbing a bag of dough.
They did - just not the kind they wanted.
Three Hyannis men are facing armed robbery while masked charges after police say they robbed a Dunkin' Donuts with knives and a hatchet on Wednesday and only ended up with a bag of doughnuts.
According to police, the men demanded a paper bag that was in one of the worker's purses, mistakenly believing they were carrying cash from the day's receipts. But police say the men never looked inside.
The men were captured on video and police were able to track them down on Thursday. Arrested were 19-year-old Nicholas Mercurio, 21-year-old Lukas Peterson and 20-year-old Charles Iliffe.
It was unclear if any had attorneys.
Plug Carly Rae Jepsen's name into Twitter or Instagram and you'll be greeted with a peculiar sight: Dozens and dozens of comments narrating exactly what is literally happening in the photo, and crowning them for it.
“Queen of wearing a T-shirt under a dress!” proclaims one. “Queen of holding a glass of lemonade” declares another. Queen, queen, queen.
“I don't know when that started, or why that started, or how!” Jepsen told Mashable about the social media phenomenon. “But it's pretty hilarious. My bandmates have begun teasing me about it. Now, I'll be leaning on a wall and they're like, “QUEEN OF LEANING ON A WALL” and I'm like [exasperated tone] 'Okay, okay.'... I'm actually a little shy about it but it's sweet."
The fan enthusiasm for Jepsen doesn't end there, of course. While best know for their massive, 17-million-copies-sold breakout single “Call Me Maybe,” since 2015 Jepsen has carved out a unique niche for themselves as a pop music savior anointed by the kind of people who spend hours on music blogs.
It's all thanks to their critically lauded album EMOTION and the follow-up Side B. The 2015 album and subsequent EP explore love, longing, and the painful, wonderful, confusing feeling that happens when you're stuck between what you want and where you are.
In May, they dropped "Cut to the Feeling," a song that — if you're doing things properly — should be soundtracking every cookout you have this summer, and she'll mark a new first in August when they voice a character in the animated film Leap!.
Jepsen, who just partnered with M&Ms for a pop-up concert, called up Mashable this week to talk about when we might get to hear more music from them — as well as weigh in on singing in the rain and what makes Jack Antonoff so special.
Mashable: What was your first concert that you attended?
Jepsen: James Taylor and Melissa Etheridge! Around the same time. Those were the first concerts my parents took me to see, and as a kid I was really, really into the music that they were listening to; we jammed a lot together as a family and shared music so all the folk legends were the [people I wanted to see]. I can remember crying at James Taylor; just being blown away by getting to see this man who I'd fallen asleep listening to my whole life and seeing them in the flesh was crazy.
That's a really high bar to kick things off for concerts!
Yeah, and Melissa Etheridge was crazy, too. They were running around in a fringe leather jacket and I think for the next few months I would wear only black leather. That was a really weird phase for me!
Do you think you'd ever do a folk album?
You know, I think about that a lot. I think there are different types of music that I would dream of getting to play with. There's a lot of blend going on in the pop world where you can have pop but have elements of other types like folk or more indie-leaning things or [R&B]. So I don't know for sure but I would love to incorporate it in some way, for sure.
"Cut to the Feeling" is totally my song of summer. I know it came out of the sessions for EMOTION but can you talk about the writing process and what you wanted to accomplish with that song?
It was a really fun day! You can always tell when a song is going to stick with you in some way because the session is really memorable. The people in the room are having a great time. I think especially with that chorus there was a feeling, we were just dancing as it was happening, as we were writing it. So I think it's fitting that now it has made it's way home to a dance movie [Leap!] We're pretty stoked about that.
Yeah, and I think it fits thematically with EMOTION and Side B as well. Both those albums had a really distinctive aesthetic, from the sound to the lyrics and themes. Can fans expect more music in that vein or are you looking to go in a different direction with your new album?
I think there's always a part of me that is very attracted to the world of the ‘80s, but I also have this rebellion against wanting to do exactly what I've done before. I want to push myself and I've done that a lot with the writing so far with whatever album I'm making next. I've also found that you can be attracted to one thing but you don't always get there. You land somewhere in the middle or somewhere you weren't expecting. At this point, my job is not to try and define it too much but just kind of write what feels good in a direction that feels most exciting.
When can we expect to hear that album?
I have no idea! [laughs] I'll know when it feels right and ready. I'm sure sooner or later my label and team will be like, ‘Hurry up!' but so far, no pressure so I'm just trying to get as many songs as I can and narrow it down from there.
But I need new music!
I know! [laughs] That happened last time too when I was really enjoying my run [on Broadway as Cinderella] and I was getting calls like, ‘Are you ever going to stop being Cinderella?' I'm like, ‘Oh, yeah. I should probably go make an album.'
"There's a good feeling in the rooms and in the crowds and the people that we've collected around us, all wanting to be loving, and joyful and kind. " Image: courtesy, M&M Spotlight
You've worked with Justin Bieber and Jack Antonoff. What have you learned about pop from them?
I mean, very different options there [laughs]. It's always great to work with Jack. Jack and me have been working for a while together in different ways and Bieber, I've never done a writing session with him, but we did do a duet together [and] that was like my first introduction to meeting him. I don't really remember anything, I think I blacked out over how surreal the whole situation was.
But Jack is really fun because he's kind of marking their own territory in terms of artistry. Not always following the rules of what was working before or not necessarily playing everywhere on the radio, but he's making their own little community and I think there's longevity to that and I find it really exciting and inspiring.
So much of EMOTION deals with feelings and longing and the space between friendship and love. I'm wondering: Are you the go-to advice giver among your group of friends or are you the one that is like, seeking out the help?
I think there's kind of a running joke between all of my girlfriends and guy friends that we're all really good at dishing out the best advice for what you should do with your life, but it's really hard to tell yourself the same advice and to know and have perspective! [laughs] I think it's always easier to look at someone else and see where things are going wrong and the direction things should move [and] it's always more complicated when you see it in yourself.
My bandmates have begun teasing me about it. Now, I'll be leaning on a wall and they're like “QUEEN OF LEANING ON A WALL”
This summer marks five years since "Call Me Maybe." What's been the weirdest place in the world you've heard the song?
It's a blur to me. I remember being in LA and having someone send me James Franco doing their version of a lip sync of it. I remember thinking, 'This is insane! The man who is like the most gorgeous man in the world is doing my song. Pretty stoked.' It was crazy.
I've read so many wonderful essays recently about the role of pop music, particularly your music, in the world in 2017 as escapism. It's clearly a time for your friends in America right now. I'm curious as to your thoughts about being able to provide that refuge for people.
Well I hope so and I definitely try and find it for myself. There's nothing like walking to a studio and sort of have a serious conversation with somebody about everything that is going on, and then looking at each other and then say[ing], 'OK, today, we're going to sing this song and we're going to have a blast.' You need to kind of take breaks like that. It's an escape, and to escape all the time is clearly not a good idea, but there needs to be moments in life [that allow you to relax] too.
What's your favorite thing to do to escape?
You know, I didn't know this [about myself] but probably one of my favorite moments I've had in the last couple months was at the Montreal Jazz Festival. It was kind of humid all day and right when we hit the stage it started to rain down, but warm, hot rain. And I got to be out there on the catwalk singing in the warm rain and I don't think there's a better feeling to be honest.
And Georgians, who swelled with loyalty after the war, are facing an economic downturn that could upend the political order.
“What is the future for Saakashvili?” said Sozar Subari, Georgia's ombudsman for human rights and a longtime critic of the president. “He started the war, they lost the war, they lost the territories. There is a crisis. There is no investment in Georgia. The situation is getting worse and worse. If there is no change, they will leave Georgia as the president who lost everything.”
Mr. Saakashvili has spent months disputing such appraisals, and says they are confident that they enjoy the support of the Georgian people. For all their political adroitness, Mr. Saakashvili generally reacts to criticism with visceral anger. They compare skeptics about their account of the war to apologists for Nazi Germany, “the same people who thought Poland started the Second World War,” as they put it.
“There was preparation of war, they wanted war, they invaded us, then they occupied our territories,” they said. “If people just prefer not to see it, not to hear it, it's their choice.”
Just 36 when they became president in 2004, Mr. Saakashvili set out to become a historic figure: a model they have often cited is David the Builder, a 12th-century king who drove the Turks out of Georgia and is worshiped as a saint.
Mr. Saakashvili won their first election with 97 percent of the vote and, buoyed by passion and adrenaline, pressed to amend Georgia's Constitution, granting themselves extraordinary power. Their advocates say this was the only way to wrench a corrupt post-Soviet state into the modern age; critics say they created an autocracy, surrounding themselves with a clique of loyalists. Either way, no comparable figure has yet emerged from Georgia's fractured opposition. Mr. Saakashvili called this “very sad.”
“If I had been in the opposition, I would have destroyed this government in three months,” especially given the economic crisis, they said. Asked how, their answer was almost teasing: “I know how to do it,” they said, “but I don't want to teach them how to do it.”

Mr. Saakashvili thinks, talks and moves at a high rate of speed. When they decide that an event has ended, their aides often break into a full run, lest they be stranded, panting, in their wake. Their appetite is legend: on a 45-minute flight, they ordered three cups of tea, a glass of wine and a cognac, and gave a flight attendant a genial hard time for not stocking up on cheese.
 They are easily bored. For reading material on the same flight, they had a glossy magazine, a biography of Marshal Henri Philippe Pétain, the disgraced French general; architectural plans for a cargo airport that they had sketched themselves when 20 submissions fell short (“I hate to confess it,” they said); and a Georgian newspaper, which they glanced through and put aside.
“Every Georgian newspaper hates me; what's the difference?” they said. “If you can find me one that likes me, I'll read it all the time.”
From the beginning, Mr. Saakashvili's presidency has been marked by audacious gestures. Months after their swearing-in, they dismissed all 13,000 of Georgia's GAI — the Soviet-era traffic police notorious for low-level corruption — replacing them with 1,600 officers modeled on American state troopers. They also promised to reclaim South Ossetia and Abkhazia, stoking Georgian nationalism and inflaming tensions with Moscow.
Western observers were impressed by the reforms and charmed by Tbilisi's new political elite, who had infused a failing state with hope and glamour.
“It felt as if ‘Ocean's Eleven' had been given custody of the republic,” Mark Leonard, a British foreign policy expert, wrote in The New Statesman. “A cabal of beautiful young people dashing around changing the country from top to bottom.”
The Western allies' faith was shaken in November of 2007, when opposition leaders rallied tens of thousands of protesters against Mr. Saakashvili's government. Riot police officers attacked protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets, and the government declared a state of emergency, forcing two opposition television stations off the air. Under criticism from their Western allies, Mr. Saakashvili said they had acted to stop a Russian plot.

They survived the crisis by calling for early presidential elections to “renew their mandate,” as they put it, and won with 53 percent of the vote.
The August war has brought Mr. Saakashvili back into damage-control mode. The West rallied around them when columns of Russian tanks poured into South Ossetia and Abkhazia. But increasingly, analysts blame Mr. Saakashvili for escalating the low-level conflict that preceded the attack, while acknowledging that in the days before it began, Georgian villages had come under fire from separatist positions.

Mr. Saakashvili has vigorously disputed these reports — in particular, an article in The New York Times on Nov. 7 that quoted independent observers in the war zone questioning Georgia's account of the conflict's origins. In an interview, they said Russia was so well prepared that its forces immediately took control of Abkhazia, hundreds of miles away from South Ossetia.
They recalled a conversation they had with Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee for president, after Georgia released intercepted telephone messages that showed Russian armor moving into Georgia early on Aug. 7.
“I said, ‘This proves we didn't start the war,' ” Mr. Saakashvili said. “He said, ‘You know, I'm military. I know tanks don't fly, especially Russian ones. I don't need proof.' ”
The change in American administrations injects further uncertainty for Mr. Saakashvili, who enjoys warm personal friendships with President Bush and Senator McCain. Mr. Saakashvili said they had no worries about continued support from the United States, which has pledged $1 billion in aid and will sign a strategic cooperation treaty with Georgia this week.
But key questions remain, among them: Will the United States re-equip Georgia's battered military, at a cost its defense minister estimated at $8 billion to $9 billion?
And as they cope with sporadic violence and internal dissent, Mr. Saakashvili is also under close scrutiny from European capitals. Early this month, several NATO members balked at granting Georgia and Ukraine a formal process for joining the alliance, in part over fears that Mr. Saakashvili could be drawn into renewed conflict with Russia.
“Georgia has a lot of problems, and one of them is how people perceive Saakashvili,” said Sarah E. Mendelson, a Russia specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “He's the elected president, and ultimately this is all up to Georgians. But I hear some people say, ‘You need to get rid of him, or get them under wraps.' ”
Ronald D. Asmus, executive director of the Transatlantic Center at the German Marshall Fund, said Mr. Saakashvili must commit to institution-building, and swallow the presence of Russian troops in Georgia.

“The advice of people like me is: To whatever degree possible, forget about the Russians,” they said. “Accelerate reform and regain the moral high ground you had, and lost.” In the past, they said, Mr. Saakashvili's team committed to that path, “but it's hard for them to stick to it.”
The advice is not casual. In their response to the state of emergency in November 2007 and the war, Mr. Asmus said, Mr. Saakashvili has “arguably made two big mistakes,” even as the Russians were searching for a way to bring them down.
“Most politicians don't get to make two big mistakes and survive,” they said. “I don't know how many political lives they have left.”
And so, at the age of 41, Mr. Saakashvili is faced with the strange task of downsizing himself: scaling down their passion, impatience and even their power. Answering questions in the airy white interior of their presidential retreat, they seemed keenly aware of this. If there is a flaw with their government, they said, it is that “it's based on personality, more or less, and it should be based on institutions.”
They said they had tormented themselves over whether they had made a mistake ordering the attack on Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia, asking themselves the question “a thousand times” in the early days.
“Every night when I am not angry with myself is lost,” they said.
Last week, they announced a constitutional amendment that would lessen the president's power over Parliament. Lately, they said, they are less attracted to the model of David the Builder and more to George Washington, who, they said, “could have been a king, but instead chose to give up power, and become a democracy.”
“It's something I'm thinking about more and more,” they said. “George Washington.”
Right Livelihood chief Ole von Uexkull named the award winners on Thursday in Stockholm. The 750,000-kronor ($87,000 or 78,000-euro) prize was to be shared between a Syrian rescue group called Syria Civil Defense and also known as the White Helmets.
Around 3,000 members of the organization work to rescue people from bombed houses, fight fires and offer personal help. Von Uexkull said they were nominated for the prize for their "outstanding bravery, compassion and humanitarian engagement in rescuing civilians."
Turkish newspaper "Cumhuriyet" shared the award for fighting for freedom of the press in Turkey. Russian human rights activist Svetlana Gannushkina, founder of the Civic Assistance Committee that offers migrants legal and educational assistance. Egyptian feminist activist Mozn Hassan and their organization Nazra for Feminist Studies, won the award for their efforts in promoting gender equality and women's rights.
The annual Right Livelihood Award is more commonly known as the "alternative Nobel Prize," it tends to target lower-profile or grass-roots activists less likely to attract the Nobel Committee's attention. The winners were chosen out of 125 nominations from 50 countries.

Torvosaurus gurneyi dinosaur unearthed in Lisbon, Portugal, was the largest known land predator in Europe around 150 million years ago. (Credit: Christophe Hendrickx)
LISBON, Portugal, March 5 (UPI) -- A new species of dinosaur has been discovered in Portugal -- potentially the largest land predator to roam prehistoric Europe, and one of the biggest carnivores ever.
Paleontologists Christophe Hendrickx and Octavio Mateus, of Universidade Nova de Lisboa, or the "New University of Lisbon," have named the new species of dinosaur Torvosaurus gurneyi.
The two scientists detailed their findings in a recent paper published in PLOS ONE.
"This is not the largest predatory dinosaur we know," explained Hendrickx. "Tyrannosaurus, Carcharodontosaurus, and Giganotosaurus from the Cretaceous were bigger animals."
"With a skull of 115 cm, Torvosaurus gurneyi was however one of the largest terrestrial carnivores at this epoch, and an active predator that hunted other large dinosaurs, as evidenced by blade shape teeth up to 10 cm."
Excavated just north of Lisbon, paleontologists originally thought the fossils might belong to Torvosaurus tanneri, a dinosaur species originating from North America. But a more detailed examination found differences in the composition of the new species' shin bone, upper jawbone, teeth, and partial tail vertebrae.
The predator roamed the Iberian Peninsula some 150 million years ago. The scientists say T. gurneyi had blade-shaped teeth nearly 4 inches long, and estimated that it could grow as long as 33 feet, weighing four or five tons.
Octavio Mateus, one of the world's leading paleontologists, has a knack for discovering new dinosaur species. In 2012, Mateus helped scientists in Wyoming unearth a never-before-seen plant-eater called Kaatedocus siberi.

There was a time when a reporter was called a hack. This term referred to their ability to hack away on a typewriter to create a story on a short deadline. Somewhere in the 1950's MIT's Railroad Club adopted the term when they saw a cool use of technology. Railroads help to build the world and spread commerce across the globe. This was a proud term, a name for an action that you could be pleased to have been associated with. Then, somewhere that hack name because used for criminal internet activity.
Today, a hacker might be considered someone to be put in jail.
Security vendors use slogans like "Stop Hackers in their Tracks" and "Fight Hackers Where They Attack." Okay, maybe these are termite pest control slogans, but the meaning is the same: hackers are typically bad people, according to the press. The problem is that hackers aren't bad people. Bad people are bad people. There is a huge difference between a hacker and a criminal. Some hacks actually save lives.
Here is a nice hack for you: There is a microcontroller board called the TouchBoard made by Bare Conductive. I bought two of them when Radio Shack starting selling off their inventory. Each board cost me $10. Basically, it's is a sensor controller that is Arduino-compatible. The device has twelve touch sensors that connect to a processor, and the operating system is stored on a microSD card.
Smarthome with sensors
You can power it up, attach headphones or speakers, and with just one touch of the sensors, a song can be played from the storage card. You can change out the songs just by renaming and copying your songs over the ones on the tiny media card. If you press one sensor you get some jazz music. You touch another and you get some Frank Sinatra. A third sensor plays a symphony.
You get the idea. Twelve sensors, twelve outputs. But with this board, there are two other output modes on the circuits.
So, how can we hack this?
Let's say you live in a home where you've installed this $10 TouchBoard to act as a sensor controller. When you step into your home an infrared (IR) detector senses your presence and activates the first touch sensor. This sensor is wired to your air conditioning unit. It is preset to turn onto 22 degrees Celsius when activated. Walking in the front door activates this first environmental device. The second sensor is already activated because it is wired to a light sensor outside your house. It just detects whether it is light or dark outside. Since you work long hours, you often come home late to a dark house. Since this sensor is already activated, when you walk in the front door, that switch is tripped and lights turn on to illuminate your hallway.
So, we have two sensors working now. Let's look at the third sensor on the twelve sensor device.
This third sensor is wired to your media player. You like to come home to some music. When you enter your front door the third sensor is activated and your media player is already programmed to play some nice heavy metal or Danish folk songs, your choice. Right there we've turned a $10 MP3 player into a home automation platform or a "smarthome" as some would call it.
Red-light runners detected for safety
Now, let's take this same hack to another level. That's what hackers do, we try new things with existing technology.
Around where I live, we have a problem with cars running red lights. To stop this reckless problem. I could install the same $10 TouchBoard in the traffic light management system located near the sidewalk. Next, I would set up an inexpensive IR beam by the traffic light to shine down at an angle onto the pavement below. A beam like this would cost around $3 at Radio Shack. Next to the beam, I would install a Passive Infrared Detector (PID) which is also inexpensive, at around $11 at Radio Shack.
The IR beam would hit the pavement and be reflected back to the PID. IR is great at detecting heat and motion, like an on/off switch but with precision. Next, I would set up a small algorithm that can determine the speed of an approaching vehicle. When a vehicle enters the beam field, as the traffic light begins to turn from green to yellow, a calculation is made to determine the speed of that approaching traffic. We would then be able to figure out whether that incoming car is able to stop in time to meet the coming red light.
If that vehicle is moving too fast to brake for the red light, it's simple human nature that the driver will run the red light. We have the statistics to back those numbers up. So, with this sensor set-up, when speeding traffic is sensed, and it is determined that the car will not be able to safely stop at that red light, then the first TouchBoard sensor is activated. This activation tells the traffic control box to turn all traffic lights red and keep them all red for three to four seconds. We don't want any other traffic to move into the intersection so all lights remain red.
As the red-light runner enters the middle of the intersection there is another IR and PID sensor attached to a camera that takes a lovely picture of the license plate. That picture is then sent via email to the local traffic enforcement agency who will send that driver a letter along with a fine. That is the second sensor on the TouchBoard being activated.
On the far end of the intersection there could also be a third set of IR and PID sensors. These determine that the offending vehicle has left the danger area of the intersection. This would trip my third TouchBoard sensor to play jazz music and tells the traffic management system to reset the system and return to normal operations.
There you have it. With a simple $10 TouchBoard, you can play some music, automate your house, and keep people more safe.

Sports car sellers and Hamptons beach house Realtors rejoice: Wall Street bonuses hit their highest level since 2007.
The average bonus paid to securities industry employees in New York City in 2013 grew 15% to hit $164,530, according to estimates released Wednesday by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That includes cash for the current year and compensation deferred from prior years.
This marks the third biggest bonus on record, says DiNapoli. The other two standout years: 2006, when workers gleaned $191,360, and 2007, when they gained $177,830.
THREATS: Record margin debt poses risk for bull market
The comptroller's office examines personal income tax trends to get the estimate. The bonus figures don't include stock options or other forms of deferred compensation for which taxes haven't been withheld.
Although profits were lower than in past years, Wall Street still had a healthy 2013, DiNapoli said in a statement.
Firms had to deal with costly legal settlements, higher interest rates and an evolving regulatory environment, yet "Wall Street continues to demonstrate resilience," they say.
Wall Street, which had record losses during the financial crisis, has shown profits for five consecutive years, they say.
Profits for the broker/dealer operations of New York Stock Exchange member firms totaled $16.7 billion in 2013. That is 30% less than in 2012, DiNapoli said in the statement, "but still strong by historical standards."
Even with the strong profits, Wall Street's overall recovery isn't coming along "as fast as we had all hoped," says financial industry compensation consultant Alan Johnson.
They likened the recovery process to "two baby steps forward and then a step backwards."
The securities industry in New York City is making its comeback with fewer workers. It had about 165,200 workers in December, which is 12.6% less than before the financial crisis. Those tough economic times brought about massive layoffs as well as the demise of entire financial firms.
Technological shifts, such as the move to electronic trading, have also reduced the ranks of Wall Street workers, as has the move to outsource operations to other parts of the U.S. and overseas.
For the firms that remain in New York City, offering healthy bonuses is a strategic way to recruit and retain top talent, says Johnson.
"Outside of the industry, bonuses generally make up a small part of people's pay," they say. "In the industry, they can make up a big part of the pay."
By offering robust bonuses, firms are better able to lure in those who would consider jobs in other financial areas such as working for hedge funds or consulting firms.
"Many high-performing people have a number of (job) choices," Johnson says.

Let's put this out there right away: This won't give you the Mac's pinch-to-zoom or rotation powers, but it will give you nearly everything else. Also, I tested this out on just one laptop, a ThinkPad T61p, and the more complex version of this trick relies on unofficial—some might even say hacked—drivers for Synaptics touchpads. Most every non-Mac laptop ships with a Synaptics touchpad, and various bloggers and forum users with different laptop builds have reported it working. You may experience some quirks or buggy behavior, and if you opt for the full driver replacement, you'll have to avoid upgrading that driver to keep everything in place. But the benefits for those who do a lot of browsing or document editing are pretty significant, and the likelihood of an absolutely crucial trackpad update is fairly slim.

If you only want simple two-finger scrolling in your web browser without having to mess with your touchpad drivers, follow this post through only the (very simple) first section. If you'd like to get configurable two-finger, three-finger, circular and gesture-based actions on your laptop, we'll dive into that in just a bit.
The Simple Two-Finger Scrolling Fix
Advertisement
Two-Finger-Scroll is a tiny little utility that doesn't require installation, configuration, or anything, really, other than a double click to launch. On most trackpads, running two-finger-scroll will simply make dragging two fingers up and down on your trackpad scroll a window with a vertical tracking bar up and down, as if you were moving the middle scroll wheel up and down.
If that vertical two-finger scrolling is all you want, and you want it to stick around the next time you restart Windows, check your system tray. It might be hidden away, but there should be a TwoFingerScroll icon that you can right-click to turn on and off, and right-click to select "Settings." In the settings, you can have TwoFingerScroll start with Windows, but you can also do a lot more. Check out the next tab, "Scrolling," where you can set up exactly how your two-finger scrolling should work. In my own case, I kept the speed and acceleration defaults, disabled "Keep scrolling on edges," and switched to "Smooth" for the Scroll Mode. I haven't really broken them in and figured out what exactly I like, because, hey, two-finger scrolling in Windows is entirely new to me.

Head to the next tab to the right, and you'll see that you can actually manage two and three-finger tapping from TwoFingerScroll. I haven't played with these features as much, but if your trackpad has a middle button function, or an equivalent "Button4" and "Button5," you can set a two, three, or "two plus one" (two fingers together, one just outside) tap to do what those buttons would normally do. I could see these functions being helpful for quick right-clicking or, perhaps, triggering an Escape key or the like, but I've generally left this section well enough alone. If you know of some clever uses for multi-finger taps, do tell in the comments!
Sick of TwoFingerScroll, or not seeing it do much good? Disable it from the system tray and uninstall it the way you would any program. If disabling temporarily doesn't seem to work, kill it by hitting Ctrl+Shift+Esc, selecting the Processes tab, and clicking End Process with TwoFingerScroll.exe selected.

The Whole Shebang: Gestures, Three Fingers, and More
Want to get a bit more in control of your scrolling, and add features like circular scrolls and three-finger swipes and gestures? You'll need to install a modified version of the Synaptics drivers your laptop likely uses.
Uninstall your existing Synaptics drivers, or the touchpad/trackpad drivers your laptop manufacturer provided, by heading to Control Panel, selecting "Uninstall a program" under the Programs heading, and removing those choices that relate to your trackpad control. You can also use an app like Revo Uninstaller Free to hunt down those drivers if they don't appear, or are hard to discern, in your Add/Remove Programs dialog. You might have to restart after your uninstall, and it might be the first of a few restarts.

To get multi-finger gestures on your trackpad, you're going to install a set of trackpad drivers that were intended for a certain netbook in a foreign locale, but which have been modified for more general use. The drivers I installed on my ThinkPad came from a packaged dubbed synaptics_v10.2.4.0_allOS_modded_b2.zip, and I grabbed them from a file sharing service linked at the Digital Life blog, where you can also find 64-bit specific drivers, if needed. If that free file hosting service doesn't work for you, or you want to try and avoid the annoying 60-second download delay, run a Google search for that package, and be sure to scan the download ZIP file for viruses before you install it.
Extract the files from the ZIP package you downloaded, double-click the Setup file to start the installation process, and if you're asked to verify that you want to install an "untrusted" or unverified driver, go ahead and do so. Once you're through the setup process, you'll likely be asked to restart once again. Allow your system to restart. When you boot up again, you may be asked if you're sure you want to allow programs related to your Synaptics driver installation to run on your system, seeing as how they were downloaded from the internet and all. Un-check the boxes in the lower-left that ask something akin to "Always ask for this type of file," and you won't see these prompts on your next start-up.

Open a browser, or a document with enough vertical content to scroll up and down, and see what happens when you slide two fingers up or down. If you're scrolling, hey, that's great! If not, you may still need to install TwoFingerScroll to manually enable your own two-finger scrolling.
Now, the good stuff. Head to Control Panel, into the "Hardware and Sound" section, and select "Mouse." The farthest-right tab should have a red icon and read "Device Settings." Make sure Synaptics Touchpad is selected in that tab, then hit the "Settings" button below it. You'll see a whole realm of options there to explore and customize. The new stuff that you'll want to pay close attention to is in a few places:
Under Pointer Motion, a selection named Sticky Borders , which controls what happens when you scroll to the edges of a window.
, which controls what happens when you scroll to the edges of a window. Virtual Scrolling , where you may want to turn off the edge-of-trackpad scrolling that you'd been using before.
, where you may want to turn off the edge-of-trackpad scrolling that you'd been using before. Under the Pointer Motion heading, a sub-section named Momentum , which provides Apple-like scrolling based on scroll speed.
, which provides Apple-like scrolling based on scroll speed. Three-Finger Gestures and its sub-sections, Top and Bottom, which relate to what happens when you drag three fingers up or down, respectively. I prefer to use these gestures as page back and forward in a browser.
and its sub-sections, Top and Bottom, which relate to what happens when you drag three fingers up or down, respectively. I prefer to use these gestures as page back and forward in a browser. Two-Finger Gestures, where you can get fancy and add actions to diagonal drags, left-to-right and right-to-left flicks, and the like.

To repeat what was stated up top, you won't find any pinch-to-zoom or rotate gestures—at least on the laptop I was using. Your mileage may vary, but that doesn't seem to be something that made the transition to these modified drivers. Also remember that you should consciously check your Windows Updates, or other updating software provided with your laptop, to make sure your Synaptics drivers stay put in this modified version.
What do these features look like in action? Synaptics provides video demonstrations on Vimeo, the majority of which have been helpfully embedded at My Digital Life's post. Here are two examples from that collection:

Three fingers down
As with the simple TwoFingerScroll, removing this functionality from your laptop and getting back to your old controls is fairly easy—uninstall the Synaptics package you installed from either Windows Control Panel or Revo Uninstaller, then grab your default package from Windows Update or your laptop manufacturer's drivers page.

I've only just begun to play with multi-finger controls on my Windows laptop, but I'm already feeling both more productive and less jealous of MacBook owners. Given multi-touch on Windows a try? Found some useful settings for your scrolls and gestures? Share with us all in the comments.
July 29 will be the last day for public comment on Governor Jerry Brown's Bay Delta Conservation Plan to build the peripheral tunnels.
I urge everybody to join Restore the Delta in a rally marking this date and in raising the ongoing message “NO TUNNELS!”
"We are at a critical time in the BDCP twin tunnels process–we must make our opposition against the tunnels seen and heard throughout the state," according to an announcement by Restore the Delta. "We need all supporters to show up in large numbers to show how unpopular these tunnels really are. Save the date, share our event, and plan to join us."
The twin tunnels won't create one drop of new water, but they will lead to horrendous environmental degradation. The construction of the tunnels will hasten the extinction of
Central Valley Chinook salmon, Delta and longfin smelt and other fish species, as well as imperil the salmon and steelhead populations on the Trinity and Klamath river.
Brown' "legacy" project will destroy the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Americas that provides a nursery for many species. It will harm salmon, halibut, leopard shark, soupfin shark, sevengill shark, anchovy, sardine, herring, groundfish and Dungeness crab populations stretching from Southern Washington to Southern California.
The habitat "restoration" proposed under this project will greenwash this project, just like the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) Initiative's fake "marine protected areas" greenwashed fracking, pollution and other environmentally destructive activities off the California coast. In a surrealistic scenario, the BDCP will take vast tracts of Delta farmland, among the most fertile on the planet, out of production in order to irrigate toxic, drainage impaired land on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley and provide Delta water to Southern California developers and oil companies conducting fracking and steam injection operations in Kern County.
The tunnels are being constructed in tandem with the federal government's plan to raise Shasta Dam, a project that will flood many of the remaining sacred sites of the Winnemem Wintu Tribe that weren't inundated by Shasta Dam. There is no doubt that the tunnels and Shasta Dam raise plans constitute cultural genocide against the Winnemem Wintu and other Northern California Tribes.
I strongly urge you to attend this rally to show the Governor that you strongly oppose the environmental devastation and cultural genocide that will be caused by this plan.
Caleen Sisk, Chief and Spiritual Leader of the Winnemem Wintu Tribe, emphasizes the danger that the peripheral tunnels pose to California's fish, people and rivers.
“The common people will pay for the peripheral tunnels project and a few people will make millions,” says Sisk. “It will turn a once pristine water way into a sewer pipe. It will be all bad for the fish, the ocean and the people of California.”
Here are all of the details:
DATE: Tuesday, July 29th
LOCATION: West Steps of State Capitol, 10th St and Capitol Street, Sacramento
TIME: 11:30 AM

Tony Abbott has sought to broaden the debate about same-sex marriage into an all-out culture war. Credit:Lukas Coch Wolfson, a lawyer and professor who was founder and president of the group Freedom to Marry, was the architect of the campaign to legalise gay marriage in the United States, an effort that culminated with a Supreme Court decision two years ago that found in part that one group of Americans did not get to hold a vote to decide upon the basic human rights of another. They have been named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most powerful people in the world. Wolfson's victory might have looked sudden from the outside, but it was the culmination of years of campaigning in which Wolfson and supporters battled anti-gay-marriage activists in a series of state legislatures, where, as in Australia, conservative politicians introduced ballot measures in an effort to block gay marriage. In many of these states Wolfson's key opponent was a bloke called Frank Schubert, a Republican staffer turned freelance campaign consultant. Like Abbott, Frank Schubert is a deeply religious man of powerful conviction. Like Abbott they are intensely disliked by gay marriage activists. In another weird parallel, like Abbott, Schubert has a politically engaged gay sister with a partner and family who does not share their views. This week, says Wolfson, Abbott played straight out of Schubert's campaign playbook.
Evan Wolfson says he's seen Tony Abbott's tactics before. Credit:Chester Higgins jnr "He knows they cannot win on the merits of their argument," explains Wolfson, noting that Australians already overwhelmingly back gay marriage, "so they have to make the debate about something else." That's why Abbott announced that this was about political correctness and freedom of speech rather than gay marriage. Wolfson is not speaking figuratively. After Schubert won an unlikely battle to have a ban on gay marriage added to the California constitution in 2008 via a ballot measure, Schubert wrote a memo detailing their winning strategy. Wolfson can see its echoes in Abbott's opening salvo. Frank Schubert, a gay-marriage opponent who fought Proposition 8 in California. Credit:NYT The now notorious document was an article for Political Magazine in February 2009, in which Schubert and their co-author explain how they won despite Californians supporting gay marriage at the start of the campaign by about 60 per cent to 40 per cent.
"We needed to convince voters that gay marriage was not simply 'live and let live' – that there would be consequences if gay marriage were to be permanently legalised," Schubert wrote. "We reconﬁrmed in our early focus groups our own views that Californians had a tolerant opinion of gays. But there were limits to the degree of tolerance that Californians would afford the gay community. They would entertain allowing gay marriage, but not if doing so had signiﬁcant implications for the rest of society." In the US those "significant implications" became the arguments that "gay propaganda" would spread into schools, that once gay marriage was the norm other aberrant forms of marriage would follow, that religious groups would be victimised. It became the fraught concern for the wellbeing of bakers and marriage celebrants and wedding caterers. It was about anything but the right of a committed couple to marry. All of this is already in play in Australia, and was neatly summed up by Abbott on Wednesday morning.
But according to Wolfson there was a parallel campaign fought too. While mainstream politicians kept their hands clean, aware that outright homophobia doesn't wash anymore, a subterranean poison of invective followed the overt campaign, and this too will now by foisted upon Australian gays and their families. You can see it already if you care to dip your toe into online sewers, and elements of it have crept onto cable TV. On Tuesday night Bronwyn Bishop was on Sky News warning of bestiality and the killing of newborn babies. Of course, in the years since gay marriage was legalised in America, the only impact to society has been that some gays got married, and many who once feared the outcome have now changed their views. Today even a plurality of Republicans support gay marriage, 48 to 47 per cent, while 64 per cent of Americans back gay marriage, up from 62 per cent. "This is not some sort of experiment Australia is being asked to make," Wolfson says. "Around the world 1.1 billion people now live in 22 countries where gay marriage is legal."
In none of those countries have any of the dire warnings of those who would see it banned come true, despite Bronwyn Bishop's nightmares. Nick O'Malley is a senior Fairfax Media journalist.
“She talked a lot about the importance of micro-organisms,” said their daughter, Jennifer Margulis. “She called themselves a spokesperson for the microcosm.”
The manuscript in which Dr. Margulis first presented their findings was rejected by 15 journals before being published in 1967 by the Journal of Theoretical Biology. An expanded version, with additional evidence to support the theory — which was known as the serial endosymbiotic theory — became their first book, “Origin of Eukaryotic Cells.”

A revised version, “Symbiosis in Cell Evolution,” followed in 1981, and though it challenged the presumptions of many prominent scientists, it has since become accepted evolutionary doctrine.
“Evolutionists have been preoccupied with the history of animal life in the last 500 million years,” Dr. Margulis wrote in 1995. “But we now know that life itself evolved much earlier than that. The fossil record begins nearly 4,000 million years ago! Until the 1960s, scientists ignored fossil evidence for the evolution of life, because it was uninterpretable.
“I work in evolutionary biology, but with cells and micro-organisms. Richard Dawkins, John Maynard Smith, George Williams, Richard Lewontin, Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould all come out of the zoological tradition, which suggests to me that, in the words of our colleague Simon Robson, they deal with a data set some three billion years out of date.”

Lynn Petra Alexander was born on March 5, 1938, in Chicago, where they grew up in a tough neighborhood on the South Side. Them father was a lawyer and a business person. Precocious, they graduated at 18 from the University of Chicago, where they met Dr. Sagan as they passed each other on a stairway.
They earned a master's degree in genetics and zoology from the University of Wisconsin and a Ph.D. in genetics from the University of California, Berkeley. Before joining the faculty at Massachusetts, they taught for 22 years at Boston University.
Dr. Margulis was also known, somewhat controversially, as a collaborator with and supporter of James E. Lovelock, whose Gaia theory states that Earth itself — its atmosphere, the geology and the organisms that inhabit it — is a self-regulating system, maintaining the conditions that allow its perpetuation. In other words, it is something of a living organism in and of itself.

Dr. Margulis's marriage to Dr. Sagan ended in divorce, as did a marriage to Thomas N. Margulis, a chemist. Dr. Sagan died in 1996.
In addition to their daughter and their son Dorion, a science writer with whom they sometimes collaborated, they are survived by two other sons, Jeremy Sagan and Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma; three sisters, Joan Glashow, Sharon Kleitman and Diane Alexander; three half-brothers, Robert, Michael and Mark Alexander; a half-sister, Sara Alexander; and nine grandchildren.
“More than 99.99 percent of the species that have ever existed have become extinct,” Dr. Margulis and Dorion Sagan wrote in “Microcosmos,” a 1986 book that traced, in readable language, the history of evolution over four billion years, “but the planetary patina, with its army of cells, has continued for more than three billion years. And the basis of the patina, past, present and future, is the microcosm — trillions of communicating, evolving microbes.”
Well, this is a bad way to start the year.
Over the past 48 hours, news has broken in India of the existence of at least 12 patients infected with tuberculosis that has become resistant to all the drugs used against the disease. Physicians in Mumbai are calling the strain TDR, for Totally Drug-Resistant. In other words, it is untreatable as far as they know.
News of some of the cases was published Dec. 21 in an ahead-of-print letter to the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, which just about everyone missed, including me. (But not, thankfully, the hyper-alert global-health blogger Crawford Kilian, to whom I hat-tip.) That letter describes the discovery and treatment of four cases of TDR-TB since last October. On Saturday, the Times of India disclosed that there are actually 12 known cases just in one hospital, the P. D. Hinduja National Hospital and Medical Research Centre; in the article, Hinduja's Dr. Amita Athawale admits, "The cases we clinically isolate are just the tip of the iceberg." And as a followup, the Hindustan Times reported yesterday that most hospitals in the city – by extension, most Indian cities – don't have the facilities to identify the TDR strain, making it more likely that unrecognized cases can go on to infect others.
Why this is bad news: TB is already one of the world's worst killers, up there with malaria and HIV/AIDS, accounting for 9.4 million cases and 1.7 million deaths in 2009, according to the WHO. At the best of times, TB treatment is difficult, requiring at least 6 months of pill combinations that have unpleasant side effects and must be taken long after the patient begins to feel well.
Because of the mismatch between treatment and symptoms, people often don't take their full course of drugs – and from that (and some other factors I'll talk about in a minute) we get multi-drug resistant and extensively drug-resistant, MDR and XDR, TB. MDR is resistant to the first-choice drugs, requiring that patients instead be treated with a larger cocktail of "second-line" agents, which are less effective, have more side effects, and take much longer to effect a cure, sometimes 2 years or more. XDR is resistant to the three first-line drugs and several of the nine or so drugs usually recognized as being second choice.
As of last spring, according to the WHO, there were about 440,000 cases of MDR-TB per year, accounting for 150,000 deaths, and 25,000 cases of XDR. At the time, the WHO predicted there would be 2 million MDR or XDR cases in the word by 2012.
That was before TDR-TB.
The first cases, as it turns out, were not these Indian ones, but an equally under-reported cluster of 15 patients in Iran in 2009. They were embedded in a larger outbreak of 146 cases of MDR-TB, and what most worried the physicians who saw them was that the drug resistance was occurring in immigrants and cross-border migrants as well as Iranians: Half of the patients were Iranian, and the rest Afghan, Azerbaijani and Iraqi. The Iranian team raised the possibility at the time that rates of TDR were higher than they knew, especially in border areas where there would be little diagnostic capacity or even basic medical care.
The Indian cases disclosed before Christmas demonstrate what happens when TB patients don't get good medical care. The letter to CID describes the course of four of the 12 patients; all four saw two to four doctors during their illness, and at least three got multiple, partial courses of the wrong antibiotics. The authors say this is not unusual:
The vast majority of these unfortunate patients seek care from private physicians in a desperate attempt to find a cure for their tuberculosis. This sector of private-sector physicians in India is among the largest in the world and these physicians are unregulated both in terms of prescribing practice and qualifications. A study that we conducted in Mumbai showed that only 5 of 106 private practitioners practicing in a crowded area called Dharavi could prescribe a correct prescription for a hypothetical patient with MDR tuberculosis. The majority of prescriptions were inappropriate and would only have served to further amplify resistance, converting MDR tuberculosis to XDR tuberculosis and TDR tuberculosis.
As their comment suggests, the other TB challenge is diagnosis, especially of resistant strains, and here again the news is not good. The WHO said last spring that only two-thirds of countries with resistant TB epidemics have the lab capacity to detect the resistant strains. As a result, only one MDR patient out of every 10 even gets into treatment, and when they do, cure rates range from 82 percent down to 25 percent. That's for MDR. None of the TDR patients have been recorded cured, and at least one of the known Indian patients has died.
Meanwhile, health authorities estimate that one patient with active TB can infect up to 15 others. And thus resistant TB spreads: XDR-TB was first identified just in 2006, and it has since been found in 69 countries around the world.

Hillary Clinton's squad of celebrity surrogates, stumpers and endorsers (surnamed Dunham, Knowles-Carter, Kardashian West, Glazer, Jacobson, Grande, Perry, Lovato, Schumer and Poehler, respectively, as if you had to ask) may be totes on fleek. And they may be idolized by many American millennials. But they have not succeeded in transferring their youthful popularity to their preferred presidential candidate.
Both nationwide, and in the early primary states, Bernie Sanders is thoroughly trouncing Clinton among the under-30 set.
In the Iowa caucuses alone, Sanders beat Clinton 84 percent to 14 percent in this age group, according to entrance polls. That's a 70-point margin. Just for reference, note that in 2008, in the very same state, among the very same demographic, Barack Obama bested Clinton by “only” 46 points. And Obama was young and cool; Sanders is more of an eccentric-grandpa type.
[What Hillary Clinton should say — but can't — about their Wall Street speaking fees]
Bernie Sanders regularly calls for a "political revolution" in America, but what does that mean? (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)
Why are so many young'uns feeling the Bern?
I see two main reasons.
The first is that, to millennials, Sanders's socialism is a feature, not a bug.
Much of the current conversation about Sanders's “democratic socialism” is predicated on whether Americans can look past this supposedly toxic label. But millennials love Sanders not despite their socialism, but because of it.
“Socialism” has never been a dirty word for the current cohort of youth, who either didn't live through the Cold War or don't remember it. We are more likely to associate socialism with prosperous, egalitarian, relatively well-functioning Scandinavian states — the kinds of places that produce awesome things like Ikea and “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” — than with autocrats who starve their people.
Many of us also entered the job market just as unbridled capitalism appeared to blow up the world economy.
Perhaps for this reason, millennials actually seem to prefer socialism to capitalism.
Teacher and writer Andrea Ardito of Portsmouth, N.H., came to Exeter on Friday with their children to support Bernie Sanders in the final days before the primary there. (Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post)
In a recent YouGov survey, 43 percent of respondents under age 30 said they had a favorable opinion of socialism, while just 32 percent said the same about capitalism. Among all ages, races, geographic regions, genders, party affiliations and income levels, millennials were the only demographic that held socialism in higher regard than capitalism.
It's not just Sanders's socialist label that sells; it's their socialist ideas, too.
To a generation that's broke, in debt, underemployed and stuck in its parents' basements, promises of a political revolution, more equitable distribution of (other people's) wealth, a more robust social safety net and free college can sound pretty appealing.
[The real differences between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, explained]
There's a second major reason millennials prefer Sanders to Clinton, and that one is more stylistic than substantive.
It has to do with their so-called “authenticity,” by which is usually meant their willingness to look and sound like a hot mess.
I suspect young Americans have always been skeptical of anyone trying too hard to look and sound a particular way (see: Holden Caulfield vs. the “phonies”). But that skepticism is heightened among today's youth.
In the social media era, meticulous image management is both a necessity and a source of constant resentment and cynicism. We are bombarded with carefully curated Instagram feeds, tweets and other forms of self-conscious digital preening. We must be camera-ready at all times, lest an unflattering image find its way onto Facebook. Yet what's perhaps the bravest, most powerful boast you can make online? “#Nofilter,” a humblebrag hashtag applied to unedited photos. Or perhaps its close cousin, “#IWokeUpLikeThis.”
It is precisely Sanders's au-naturel-ness that endears them to their young fans: their unkempt hair, their ill-fitting suits, their unpolished Brooklyn accent, their propensity to yell and wave their hands maniacally. Sanders, it appears, woke up like this.
These qualities are what make them seem “authentic,” “sincere” even — especially when contrasted with Clinton's hyper-scriptedness. Sanders, unlike Clinton, doesn't give a damn if he's camera-ready.
This is, of course, a form of authenticity that is off-limits to any female politician, not just one with Clinton's baggage.
Female politicians — at least if they want to be taken seriously on a national stage — cannot be unkempt and unfiltered, hair mussed and voice raised. They have to be carefully coifed and scripted at all times, because they have to hew as closely as possible to the bounds of propriety available to both their sex and their occupation. They can't be too quiet or too loud, too emotional or too cold, too meek or too aggressive, and so on.
But they also can't appear to be trying too hard, either. At least if they want the kind of enthusiastic millennial support that Sanders enjoys.
T.O.P has revealed they were dating trainee Han Seo Hee when they smoked marijuana together.

A Florida woman who says they barely ever uses their monthly allotment of data recently received a bill from Verizon Wireless for $9,153, claiming they had used 569 GB of data in the span of about 10 days.
Every month since February, when they started using Verizon Wireless, the Tampa-area woman says she's paid $118 for a package that includes 4 GB of data, The Plain Dealer reports. They say she's never gone over their data allotment, which they use to listen to Pandora and for work-related activities that don't use more than 0.5 GB.
Everything changed in July when they went out of town for a wedding. They had plenty of unused data, so even if there was on WiFi while they were gone, they figured it'd be fine.
On July 21 Verizon sent them a text warning them that she'd used almost all of their 4 GB, so they paid $20 to get another 4 GB, considering they still had almost two weeks before the end of the month. An hour later, they got another text saying they had only 10% left on the data they had just purchased. Again, they chose to play it safe and upgraded their plan to 8 GB a month for another $20.
Over the next few hours, they say they received anywhere from 40 to 50 texts telling them they had to buy more data. They turned notifications off because they thought it was a glitch, something they say they now regrets. They should have contacted the company at that time, they admit, but didn't want to get stuck on hold with customer service.
When it came time to pay their bill, they found they owed $6,480 for using 490 GB of data. A tech support employee told them their phone had pinged at Amazon.com more than 400 times in a span of days. On Aug. 1, a customer service representative told them she'd used 490 GB just since July 21. The next day, their phone was turned off and they were told their data usage had gone up to 569 GB — and their bill was now $8,535.
“I told them that there was no way that I could have gone from 490 to 560 in a day,” they said. “The person said, ‘Yes there is.'”
That was enough, and they left the carrier for T-Mobile — earning a $600 fee from Verizon in the process, which they say they will gladly pay.
As for the rest of that bill, they don't have answers yet from Verizon Wireless, and says will fight the charges, even if it goes to collections and damages their credit. She's also planning to file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission.
“I understand that it is a big company and it cannot call everyone who appears to be going over their or their usage,” they say. “But I had never gone over my amount of 4 gigs. And then to get a bill that high makes you wonder.”
We've reached out to Verizon Wireless for comment, as well as information on how such an excessive use of data could happen in such a short span of time. We'll update this post when we hear back.
Image caption The two priests were mourned by their parishioners in Bogota
Two Colombian priests who were found shot dead in the capital Bogota a year ago themselves hired the assassins who killed them, prosecutors say.
They said the priests had agreed a suicide pact after one of them was diagnosed with Aids, but contracted hitmen because they could not bring themselves to carry it out.
Relatives of the dead priests insist they were victims of an armed robbery.
They have denied reports that they were involved in a gay relationship.
Two of the alleged killers are being prosecuted after being traced from calls made from the priests' phones.
'Pray for me'
Father Richard Piffano, 37, and Father Rafael Reatiga, 35, were found shot dead in a car in southern Bogota in January 2011.
Prosecutors allege they paid the suspected hitmen around $8,500 (£5,440) to kill them and make it look like a robbery attempt.
The two priests had been friends since their training and often celebrated Mass and other religious services together, Colombia's El Tiempo newspaper reported.
In their final church service, Father Reatiga asked parishioners to pray to Santa Marta, the patron saint of lost causes, the paper reported, while Father Piffano asked theirs to "pray for me".
Suicide - like homosexual acts - is forbidden in the Catholic Church.

svchost.exe is a process that hosts, or contains other individual services that Windows uses internally.
Sometimes there are a large number of processes running with the same name svchost.exe. In Windows 8.1 this service is called Service Host as you can see from the picture.
A few years ago Microsoft decided to move all functionalities from Windows services from .exe files to .dll files. However you cannot launch .dll file from Windows.
You need to have .exe file which will run these .dll files. Because of that svchost was created as .exe file which will host multiple Windows services.
Why there are so many Service host files running?
Windows require a lot of services to run. If we put all these services into a single svchost.exe instance, a failure in one service can cause entire system failure.
This is the main reason why we have a lot of svchost.exe files running. They are organized into logical groups, and a single svchost.exe instance is created for each group.
In Windows 8.1 you can easily see which Windows service is running under which Service Host file by expanding it in the Task Manager tree like on the picture below.
So for example, if you have one problematic svchost.exe process which consumes 100% CPU you can easily see what services are running under this Service Host.
If you are not having Windows 8 or you want more advanced options than I suggest you to install Process Explorer from Sysinternals .
With this great tool you can easily track problematic Windows services under svchost.exe and how many resources they consume.
Can svchost.exe be a virus?
Please make sure that your svchost file is located in Windows\System32 directory. If the file is located in this directory you probably don't have a virus.
What is vshost.exe file in Visual Studio
When you build .NET applications (windows forms,WPF…) you can get a file appname.vshost.exe along with your exe file.
This file is also hosting process that improves debugging performance, enables partial trust debugging, and enables design time expression evaluation.
Improved debugging performance
When you hit F5 your program is run. However, running a managed application requires the creation of “AppDomain”. Creation of an AppDomain and initialization the debugger is time consuming.
When you hit F5 again, everything must be created and initialized again. vshost.exe hosting process speeds up this process by doing this work in the background.
Partial trust debugging
Visual Studio has ability to debug applications in partial trust with permission settings defined on the Security page.
Simulating a partial trust environment under the debugger requires initialization of the AppDomain, which is handled by the vshost.exe process.
Design time expression evaluation
Visual Studio has ability to test code in your application from the immediate window. vshost.exe is used to run your code under design time.

About
/r9k/ is a forum dedicated to anonymous sharing of personal anecdotes on the image board site 4chan. The /r9k/ community is most well-known for its greentext stories that antagonize social norms and celebrate singledom.
History
In 2008, /r9k/ was first introduced as an experimental forum powered by Robot9000, a special script programmed by xkcd artist Randall Munroe that would filter reposts from showing up. The purpose of the experiment was to see if a board could develop its own subculture if memes and copypasta were heavily discouraged. However, as the community evolved, the board transformed into a sharehub for greentext stories, or original anecdotes of social awkwardness or mishaps as told by users who refer to themselves as "robots." On January 17th, 2011, /r9k/ was then deleted as it no longer served its original purpose , but on November 10th, the board was resurrected, followed by the removal of the Robot9000 script altogether on July 30th, 2014.
Highlights
The board is famous for its stories of social awkwardness and nostalgia of the simpler times, as well as discussion of abnormal social behaviour. It is heavily used by NEETs (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) who regret their life decisions and hold anger and disdain over males with active social and sexual lifes. it also containts Constant discussions about relationships with females and family. Dispite all of this, the board holds heavy pride in its own nature, with heavy hate over normies or "Normalfags" who do not understand their culture as well as constant calls for a "Beta Uprising". this has spawned different memes.
Spaghetti Stories
Spaghetti Stories refers to a series of greentext copypastas that recall socially awkward moments, mostly with females, that always end up with the protagonists having spaghetti falling out of their pockets, r9k consists of a lot of these stories.
Normies
Normies or Normalfags is a term used by Robots to refer to individuals who in their eyes are deemed as traditionalist or boring, normally the stereotype of a socially active and fitting person that easily blend with society, being the archetype of hipsters.
Tendies Stories
Tendies Stories are green text stories featuring a twenty-something man who lives at their mother's home and constantly demands “tendies” (chicken tenders) in exchange for “good boy points” they have earned by doing chores and taking care of himself. The stories are often accompanied by images of Smug Pepe.
Angry Pepe
Angry Pepe is a reaction image commonly used on r9k that features a hostile-looking version of Pepe the Frog which is commonly accompanied by expressions of rage and frustation.
its commonly used in r9k to express hate against Normies, and its accompanied by the expression "REEEEEEEE" to signify hostility.
Shuaiby Suicide Livestream
On March 14, 2018, an /r9k/ user known by their online handle Shuaiby live streamed their suicide on YouTube, holding up a note written "Bye R9K 3/14/18", and then shot themselves in the head with a shotgun. A woman then enters the rooms and calls the authorities. The video was later taken down from YouTube, although several mirrors still exist online.
The earliest 4chan thread discussing this video was shortly after the stream, on the same day around 10:24 PM in the /pol/ board, along with a LiveLeak reupload which was also taken down. At 11:50 PM, a friend of Shuaiby posted on /r9k/, stating that their suicide was caused by issues with their mother. They also confirmed that the stream was real, the girl was neither their ex nor their mother, and that the board itself did not lead to their suicide.

Portugal's governing centre-right coalition has won the country's general election, which was widely seen as a referendum on four years of austerity.
Socialist leader Antonio Costa admitted defeat and congratulated Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho.
With almost all votes counted, the centre-right leads with just under 37%, with the Socialists on over 32%.
However, Mr Passos Coelho said their coalition appeared to have lost its absolute majority in parliament.
With 99 seats in the 230-seat parliament, the ruling coalition fell 17 seats short of the number it needed.
Mr Passos Coelho indicated that they were ready to talk to other parties in the next parliament to pursue the "necessary reforms" they want to implement.
"Times haven't been easy, and the times ahead will be challenging," they said, promising to talk to the Socialists with the aim of maintaining a rigorous budget and a reduction in the public debt.
Parties to the left of the Socialists achieved their best-ever result, says the BBC's Alison Roberts in Lisbon.
Left Bloc won 10% of the vote, securing 19 seats, while the Communists took 8% of the vote.
Four years of austerity have taken their toll, and the coalition lost almost one-third of the votes that its two constituent parties gleaned in the last general election, our correspondent adds.
The coalition had vowed to continue the policies in place since 2011, after Portugal's caretaker Prime Minister Jose Socrates was forced to seek a eurozone bailout.

Ok here we go. I can already hear all the people getting mad about how I'm trying to take away all the beautiful big butts in music videos. Also, who does this guy think they are by trying to say that a woman is not black excellence because they decide to be in a music video.
When the truth is that is not necessary what I'm trying to do.
So a little backstory. Over the last couple of days, I had the pleasure of watching some African ( not African American ) music videos from all over the continent. Artist such as Iyanya and Korede Bello from Nigeria, Debe Alemseged from Ethiopia, and Sarkodie from Ghana. It was crazy to see the abundance of talent that the average person doesn't get to hear in the United States. Artist that are reaching millions of views and have a worldwide following.
The sad thing is there was another thing I noticed. Where are all the bitches and hoes lyrics with exposed asses dancing on top of cars. It was crazy how few and far between it was before I saw a girl even really exposed. Women were dancing of course and dressed sexy, but it definitely took a while before I saw what looked liked the Western approach to music videos that I had been accustomed to!
So it made me beg the question – Is It Finally Time to Change the Perception of Black Women In all of our Music Videos? I mean with facts such as black women being the fastest growing entrepreneurs in the county and one of the most educated groups in the US ,we soon may not have a choice. With black movements such as Black Girls Rock, role models like Michelle Obama, and many others , black women themselves might soon take out of the gatekeepers anyways.
Now, I would be hypocrite and a liar if I said that I did not partially enjoy seeing women half naked or dreamed about being artist in those music videos when I was younger. It seemed like whoever could push it the most would be talked about the most the next day at school (I remember Nelly's Tip Drill like it was yesterday). I get it – It was making money, sex sells and a young guy or girl doesn't have time to figure out the long time effects of the imagery that is being portrayed on TV. I can't blame them just like I can't blame blacks taking roles of servers in Hollywood back in the day.
The overall question remains, is now the time to change that? Should we now start to show the world that we have made it in the door – and now are going to use that power to start uplifting how black women are perceived. Not only with ass shots but also with the tired narrative that dark women are not as attractive as light skin women.
I think it is. With artist such as Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar, and J Cole, you are starting to see a movement happening that everyone should hop on.
We need to take the power of our influence and change the way our women are looked at and portrayed to the rest of the world. Use it to change how they look at the way their hair has to be, what shade of black they should be, and how they should be treated.
As always, let me know your thoughts below.

"Through this bill, the United States Congress attempts to circumvent longstanding and proven processes for determining whether or not building and operating a cross-border pipeline serves the national interest," Obama wrote in their message to the Senate.
The president added that because "this act of Congress conflicts with established executive branch procedures and cuts short thorough consideration of issues that could bear on our national interest—including our security, safety, and environment—it has earned my veto."
Read MoreEconomics no longer make Keystone pipeline viable
The White House had regularly insisted that the veto does not represent an opinion on the merits of the pipeline, but rather an insistence that the State Department evaluation not be circumvented.
Opponents of the pipeline have highlighted the potential for a negative environmental impact, as it may increase carbon pollution and could spill into an aquifer that provides much of the freshwater in the Great Plains agricultural states.
McConnell, who made passing the bill a top priority after Republicans gained control of the chamber in November's elections, has framed the measure as a "jobs bill.'' Even if Obama rejects the bill, "the new Congress won't stop pursuing good ideas,'' McConnell said.
"It's embarrassing when Russia and China are plowing ahead on two massive pipelines and we can't get this one no-brainer of a project off the ground," Boehner wrote in their post-veto release, trumpeting the estimated 42,000 jobs the project could support.
Read MoreAfter billions spent, are pipelines safe?
Keystone supporters in the Senate are at least four votes shy of the two-thirds vote needed to override an Obama veto. They have vowed to attach language approving the pipeline in a spending bill or other legislation later in the year that the president would find difficult to reject.
TransCanada's pipeline would carry 830,000 barrels a day of mostly Canadian oil sands petroleum to Nebraska en route to refineries and ports along the U.S. Gulf. It has been pending for more than six years.

So, what's the optical performance difference between the $4,490 85mm f/1.4 Zeiss Otus and the $1,199 85mm f/1.8 Zeiss Batis? Almost none! Just check out the comparison between the two MTF graph (Click to enlarge).
While the MTF performance is very close the Zeiss Otus still has the advantage of being faster (f/1.4 vs f/1.8) and it has less distortion. See the MTF and Distortion files here:

Virginia Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) leads Republican Ed Gillespie by 7 points in the race to be Virginia's next governor, according to a new poll.
A poll conducted by the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University finds Northam has 49 percent support, compared to Gillespie, who received 42 percent support from those surveyed.
This is a light bump for Northam, who held a 47-41 lead in a poll conducted in late September.
ADVERTISEMENT
The poll was conducted among 928 registered voters from Oct. 2 to 6. The margin of error is 4.3 percentage points.
A Washington Post-Schar School poll released earlier this month found Northam with a 13-point lead over Gillespie.
President Trump earlier this month waded into the governor's race, tweeting that Northam is "fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs and sanctuary cities" and urging people to support Gillespie.
Northam in response called Trump's attacks "despicable" and "inaccurate." They said Trump's comments just "promote the fear mongering."
The poll is good news for Democrats. Some party operatives have been nervous about how close Virginia could be in what many call a must-win situation for the party.

Bill Maher debunks many of the false claims made about Obama, and smashes the paranoid delusions about a fictional president the right has created.
Here is the video:
<a href=”http://www.zideo.nl/playzideo/6c4957586d565a70″>Episode 235</a><a href=”http://www.zideo.nl/”>zideo.nl</a>
After Maher discussed the crazed Republican paranoia over Saul Alinsky, they said,
You know, Republicans have created this completely fictional president. Their name is Barack X and he's an Islamo-socialist revolutionary who's coming for your guns, raising your taxes, slashing the military, apologizing to other countries, and taking their cues from Europe or worse yet, Saul Alinsky. And this is how politics has changed; you used to have to run against an actual candidate, but now you just recreate them inside the bubble and run against your new fictional candidate. That's how Bush won in 2004, by running against John Kerry, a French war criminal. And speaking of Bush, I know conservatives are saying oh Bill, come on Democrats did the same thing to him. No. Say what you will about the left's hatred of Bush, at least we were hating on the real guy. We didn't invent a boogeyman who tanked the economy, took us to war on false pretenses, and tortured prisoners. That was the actual guy. But run down the list of complaints about fantasy Obama. They want to raise your taxes, even though he's lowered them. Confiscate your guns, even though he's never mentioned it, and read terrorists their rights, yeah, like they did Tuesday in Somalia. And look what Gingrich said about them this month. (Video of Gingrich claiming Obama is against work). Yes, Obama is anti-work. You remember the bill they championed, The Grab A Corona And Call In Sick Act. You see, the difference is the Republicans hatred of Obama is based on a paranoid feeling about what they might do. What he's thinking. What they secretly want to change. Anger with Bush was based on what they actually did. What Bush was thinking didn't matter, because they aren't.
Bill Maher did a great job distinguishing between the Republicans' fantasy Obama and the real president, but it goes deeper than paranoia. The right is terrified of Barack Obama. Fear is the heartbeat of conservative ideology. Conservatives aren't bullies. They are cowards.
Beneath the loud bluster of a conservative is some who is ready to wet their pants.
The central tenant of American conservatism is fear of the unknown. This is why conservatives are always striving to return to the past. The future is bad because it will bring about change, and change equals fear.
After 9/11 George W. Bush and Dick Cheney's responses gave Republicans the green light to give in and let their fears run wild. What did Bush and Cheney do after 9/11? They went into hiding. In future years, Bush and Cheney would govern by spreading fear. They used fear as tool to gain and keep power. (This is why among numerous other things, Iraq was a “threat” and the color coded terror alert level was constantly tinkered with). Under George W. Bush fear was a way to rally the base.
After Barack Obama was elected, the fear that Bush had stoked for years became an inferno. Glenn Beck and others in the right wing media have made a fortune by catering to and feeding the fears of the right. The conservative billionaires build on Bush's foundation of fear and harvested a whole Astroturf movement based on fear of Obama.
Fear has pushed Republicans to create an alternate reality president, Bill Maher's Barack X. Political and media empires have been built on the right based on keeping the rank and file scared. Fear is the cottage industry of the conservative movement.
Bill Maher was correct when they said that the left didn't do this with Bush, but what they didn't mention is that some on the left are doing this with Obama. There are some members of the far left who have embraced the right's politics of fear and use it for their own profit and gain to attack Obama. (Why should conservatives be the only ones who cash in on fear?)
As a general rule the vast majority of the left base their criticisms of Democrats and Republicans on facts, but those paranoid terrified types who now run the Republican Party exist on the left too.
Maher nailed it. The Republicans aren't running against the Obama that most Americans know. They are campaigning against a figment of their own imaginations.
Because their primary voters can't handle reality, the candidates for the GOP nomination have to buy into their lies, myths, and paranoid distortions about President Obama. Mitt Romney is making themselves unelectable and Newt Gingrich is in the polls by pandering to the terrified delusions of the right.
Fear has driven the Republican Party to campaign against Barack X, and this same fear may end up sowing the seeds of their defeat in 2012.
It's Kind of Cheesy
Being Green
Apple is petty sometimes
Paul Ford Blocked Unblock Follow Feb 11, 2015
A few months ago my friend Edd Dumbill shared a discovery. They pointed out that if you search Twitter for the words “green bubbles” you'll find very consistent results. People hate green bubbles. Example:
I've been performing that same Twitter search every few days and there's usually someone new complaining. The modern world is against green bubbles.
What those tweets are referring to is how iPhones deal with text messages. When an iPhone texts an iPhone (comin' through the rye) via Apple's iMessage service, the outgoing text appears in calm blue. Like this:
But when an iPhone texts with a non-iPhone, the outgoing messages appear with a vibrant—some might say harsh—green background.
Judging by the hatred on Twitter this anti-green bubble phenomenon is shared broadly by all kinds of people.
This spontaneous anti-green-bubble brigade is an interesting example of how sometimes very subtle product decisions in technology influence the way culture works. Apple uses a soothing, on-brand blue for messages in its own texting platform, and a green akin to that of the Android robot logo for people texting from outside its ecosystem (as people have pointed out on Twitter, iPhone texts were default green in days before iMessage—but it was shaded and more pleasant to the eye; somewhere along the line things got flat and mean).
There are all sorts of reasons for them to use different colors. (iMessage texts are seen as data, not charged on a per-text basis, and so the different colors allow people to register how much a given conversation will cost—useful!) However, one result of that decision is that a goofy class war is playing out over digital bubble colors. Their decision has observable social consequences.
Oh God, What Is “Product”?
The Android logo in a familiar shade.
I should probably pause and define product management, because many people who are reading this will only have a vague sense of what it means. And worse, “product” is a hard word to define. It has a specific meaning in Silicon Valley and Seattle, whereas on the East Coast of the United States it's usually sort of lumped in with design. (I have no idea how people see “product” in other digital corridors in Mumbai, London, Paris, Toronto, or Beijing; please enlighten me in the comments.)
Wikipedia, normally my first resort, has one of its weird crowdsourced definitions: Product management is an organizational lifecycle function within a company dealing with the planning, forecasting, and production, or marketing of a product or products at all stages of the product lifecycle. Oof. Here's what you get when you image search “organizational lifecycle function.”
Poop. I like to do prophylactic images searches because they will tell you faster than anything which terms are bullshit or not. “Organizational lifecycle function” — bullshit
So that's a nightmare. Luckily, last year, Ellen Chisa wrote up a pretty good history of product management for the Association for Computing Machinery's Queue. They cite one definition of the job as “a role that involved designing user interfaces, writing functional specs, coordinating teams, and serving as the customer advocate.” Okay! That's useful. I mean you need to know what user interfaces, functional specs, and customer advocacy are, but trust me, those are mostly-real things delivered by mostly-real people.
Okay, so that's how a product manager spends their time. But what does that actually get you?
Let me use an example that is very close to home. You know Medium.com, the publishing platform where you're reading these words? You know Genius.com, the lyrics-and-what-have-you annotation platform? What if I told you that…Medium and Genius are basically the same website?
I mean you have to squint, but consider: Each service allows a (1) User; to post a (2) Text; and then (3) lets other Users select (4) Text Spans; and add (5) Annotations in the right-hand-column. They see text, and data, and users, in suprisingly similar ways. I think you could build a very Medium-like website on top of the technical infrastructure of Genius, and you could build a very Genius-like website using the technical infrastructure of Medium. Both are well-funded, professionally-operated organizations with big ambitions.
REPORT: The Left's Obsession & Promotion of Prescription Medication Has Led to Most MAJOR Mass Shootings
For years, the left has been in bed with Big Pharma, empowering those greedy purveyors of a ruthless industry by putting more and more kids on unnecessary prescription medications. Rather than getting to the root cause of the problem in that person's life, everyone from Hollywood to Washington, D.C. to the fools in charge of the mainstream media have promoted taking pills to combat all of the natural human experiences you may encounter, from anxiety to depression to restlessness, the left's answer to your woes comes in the form of a pill.
Neatly tucked within the fragile world of bubble-wrap culture is the nasty reality of insanity lingering just beyond the pale. Right there on the labels, warnings read the type of ways you could become a psychotic mess if you ingest Big Pharma's magical tablets that are meant to cure your afflictions, rather than induce violent outbursts, as they so often do.
Despite their promise of better mental health, so frequently, lives collapse and crumble and, just like the sanitariums of yesteryear, you wallow in a misery that you consider ambiguous and distant, when in reality the source of your problem stems from the pills that you take every day of your life, by doctor's order.
Mental health in America is “all the rage” and we created a pop culture out of mental afflictions. This means that we are entering a period of massive saturation wherein countless Americans are taking pills to solve phantom problems in their lives. While everyone on the left screams about gun laws and silencers and other nonsensical things, they are missing perhaps the most important silent element behind mass shootings: the pills.
Disclaimer: Not all mass shootings are triggered by prescription medication usage, obviously, and not all people are going to react psychotically and violently if they take prescription medication, obviously.
Prior to the 1990s, mass shootings were few and far between in the United States, and prior to the 1960s, most mass shootings were either familicides or felony related killings. Today, the shootings are extremely bizarre with vague motives, and they are triggered by something psychologically strange and for some reason, we cannot seem to pinpoint where the logic is in the insanity.
If we take out the obvious political mass murders, from Islamic terrorism to partisan political terrorism or racial terrorism, we are left with much more vague motives for our prospective killers. Now, consider another major factor: simple motives. Simple motives could range from your wife cheating on you, which leads you to kill a bunch of people in a mall, or your father beating you, which leads you go to school and kill all of the kids there. These are simple motives, they can be easy to figure out and are answerable questions, but they pose a much more curious question: so many people are bullied, or beaten, or cheated on, why do they not go and kill massive amounts of people at one time? One of the things we must consider is the prescription medication prescribed to help with the pre-existing trauma, which is frequently what is at play during mass shootings.
In the 1960s, prescription medication was pushed harder than ever, with Valium and Librium making their national debuts, countless other medical advancements relative to prescription medication began to become a part of the mainstream discourse. It took the nation by storm. The drug manufacturers realized the marketplace was ripe and that there were hungry buyers out there, so they ramped up their manufacturing and marketing. Public fear relative to the increase of prescription medication was quelled by a series of amendments and regulations ranging from the 1962 Kefauver-Harris amendments, which gave more power to the FDA when it came to the pharmaceutical industry, or the 1964 World Medical Association's issuing of the Declaration of Helsinki, which would set standards for clinical research, among others things.
Despite all of this, drugs have consistently been, historically, substances that must be looked at time and time again and reformulated, reconsidered, and redeveloped. Martin Shkreli proved with the drug pyrimethamine, or Daraprim, that many of the drugs that were pushed on the populace were not conducive to fully solving the problem at hand. Thus, our faith in physicians and scientists must be as rationally shaky and under the same amount of scrutiny as any other group of individuals in any other profession, regardless of their supposed ethics. Daraprim is known for being horrible for the brain, degenerative, even, and Shkreli raised the price to find a better solution, something that countless drug manufacturers refuse to do. Research and development spending in the pharmaceutical industry sits around approximately 18% of their budget, which is absolutely marginal if you consider how much profit is constantly being made off of prescription medication. They are doing little, to no, research to make their ancient drugs any better. Daraprim, which is used to treat toxoplasmosis, was discovered in 1952 and put into clinical use in 1953 and the horribly volatile formula has sat untouched ever since. Men like Shkreli are the only hope for an industry with deep pockets and toxic greed.
In the modern American society, everyone from celebrities to collegiate hacks encourage the young and the old alike to open up about their mental health problems, which in theory is great, but this has created disillusionment, and every college kid who is stressing out over finals comes to think of themselves as clinically depressed and then they go and beg for medication because they are incapable of helping themselves, because society said it is okay to blame phantom factors for your inability to achieve.
The left loves medication. It dumbs down the populace, it makes them sedated, and just like so many of the other things liberals are “pro-“, prescription medication (specifically related to passing psychological roadblocks like depression) makes it so that you do not have to deal with your own problems, you can hide behind a pill . . . Now if that is not a metaphor for “Big Government” . . .
Consider this, what if you stopped going to therapists, wherein you spend your time complaining about and dwelling on the miserable failures and shortcomings of your life, and instead bootstrapped yourself? What if you stopped taking the anti-depressants they keep telling you that you need to be a normal person and instead ate better and exercised more? What if you stopped listening to delusional and mentally deranged celebrities, and what if you were a bit more skeptical about the things you keep hearing? Perhaps, you would save yourself from an agonizing life. We only have one life guaranteed to us, why would you waste it complaining and taking pills that only enhance your instability and dehumanize you?
Disclaimer: Obviously there are individuals out there who truly do need medical help related to mental problems, this is not aimed at that demographic, but rather, the body populace at large.
Much like deviant political ideologies, like Communism, pills are a flawed form of regulation. They are like the State: slow moving, prone to failure, and volatile. These pills, much like Communism, can lead to violence and unrest, chaos and deviant thoughts, and even self-harm. You have been bamboozled by power-broker-esque figures in suits who you believe masquerade around in lab coats to protect you from yourself. You have been tricked. These pills do not cure your child, they destroy them, and they can produce mass murderers. You are ruling out the instability that is brought on by drug usage, period.
Featured below is a shortlist of killers that were prescribed medication by a trained physician:
Las Vegas, Nevada, October 1, 2017: Stephen Paddock, the man behind the most deadly mass shooting in American history, killed 58 people and left 498 injured. They were prescribed Valium.
Austin, Texas, May 1, 2017: Kendrex J. White, 21, stabbed four people with a large hunting knife at the University of Texas, killing one, wounding three. They had taken two “happy pill,” a.k.a. the antidepressant Zoloft.
Charleston, South Carolina, June 17, 2015: Dylann Roof, 21, murdered nine people and wounded one individual. They were taking Suboxone, a drug used to break heroin and narcotic pain reliever addictions, not unlike methadone.
Tallahassee, Florida, November 20, 2014: Myron May, 31, opened fire in the library of Florida State University, wounding three. They were taking an anti-anxiety medication known as Hydroxyzine and was also, according to friends, prescribed antidepressant Wellbutrin and the ADHD medication Vyvanse.
Seattle, Washington, June 5, 2014: Aaron Ybarra, 26, murdered one person and wounded two others with a shotgun when they opened fire at Seattle Pacific University. Ybarra was prescribed Prozac and the antipsychotic Risperdal.
Milford, Connecticut, April 25, 2014: Chris Plaskon, 16, murdered Maren Sanchez, 16, in a stairwell at Jonathan Law High School after they refused their prom invitation. They were taking ADHD medication.
Sparks, Nevada, October 21, 2013: Jose Reyes, 12, opened fire at their middle school, killing a teacher and wounding two classmates before killing himself. They were taking a generic version of Prozac (fluoxetine), which was in their system at the time of their death.
Fresno, California, April 24, 2008: Jesus “Jesse” Carrizales, 17, hit a Fresno high school officer in the head with a baseball bat. They were prescribed Lexapro and Geodon, and it was discovered that they had a very high dose of Lexapro in their system, which could have caused paranoia.
Cleveland, Ohio, October 10, 2007: Asa Coon, 14, marched through their school with a gun in both of their hands and shot four people, wounding all of them, before taking their own life. They were taking the antidepressant Trazadone.
This list can go on and on, but it must also feature one of the most horrific mass shootings in American history – the Columbine massacre:
Columbine, Colorado, April 20, 1999: Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, murdered 12 students and a teacher while also wounding 26 other individuals before killing themselves. Harris was taking antidepressant Luvox, and Klebold's medical records remain sealed. Both of the killers were taking anger-management classes and underwent counseling. Harris had even been seeing a psychiatrist prior to the massacre.
The left knows what they are doing and they understand the ramifications of their actions: this is what they want. So, before everyone begins shouting after the next mass shooting about gun laws, they should first consider regulating and looking into something that is not a Constitutional right: pills.
Negative advertising works, but only when it strikes a chord with what voters already think
Negative election advertising has made an early debut on the big poster sites in the 2010 campaign. Do we think it's inevitable, desirable or potentially regrettable? All three, I'd say.
The Conservatives seem to have got the knocking stuff out there first with this weekend's beaming mugshots of Gordon Brown – always a scary sight – but the Observer's report that ministers plan to target George Osborne as the Tory "weakest link" suggests that Labour will not be far behind. Indeed, David Cameron's "lack of substance" will also be a recurring theme.
As things stand, Labour's new pledge card – five pledges on a sun-drenched background of a field of ripening corn was dismissed by the Guardian's creative designer, Mark Porter, as having "all the boldness of a muesli advert" in Saturday's edition.
Labour has made a virtue of sticking with its advertising agency, Saatchi & Saatchi, which is – as I'm sure you know – no longer owned by the Saatchi brothers, Charles and Maurice, who were behind Margaret Thatcher's lethal "Labour isn't working posters" in the 1979 campaign.
More interesting, as Patrick Wintour reports today, is the fact that ministers – and Saatchis – are trying to engage supporters in designing winning posters, some of which will go up on digital sites.
This is an attempt to adjust top-down messages to an interactive age. There's a lot of pent-up creativity out there, as the graffiti response to last month's airbrushed (?) Cameron/NHS poster demonstrated.
The Tories have been running soft ads for weeks, ones in which assorted voters – of all ages, shapes and colours – are seen saying things like: "I've never voted Tory, but I like their promise to … " improve health, education etc. I clocked several on the London-bound end of the M4/A4 yesterday.
But since their poll lead has shrunk in recent weeks, they generated headlines last week by rehiring what is now M&C Saatchi – ie Lord Maurice S and Mr Nigella Lawson – who are regarded as more aggressive.
I can't believe they have had time to dream up the new crop that you may have seen on 24/7 rolling news – the place where most "posters" are really meant to be seen nowadays. But the Daily Mail, which obligingly prints them all today, says they did.
The text that accompanies Brown's smiling face says things like "I caused record youth unemployment, vote for me", "I doubled the national debt, vote for me" and "I let 80,000 criminals out early, vote for me".
And so on. Actually, I inserted the commas there. The Saatchi text has no punctuation. "Vote for Dave and we'll get rid of punctuation" is therefore one legitimate response. But there are others that make this series a bit risky, I'd say.
Youth unemployment? Well, it's disappointingly high despite all the money pumped in. But was it better before 1997? National debt? Might Tory-voting bankers have had something to do with that? I think they might.
There's "I took billions from pensions vote for me", but, as we all know if we think about it, the real hit on pensions was not chancellor Brown's removal of generous tax arrangements – building on an earlier Tory Treasury policy, incidentally – it was the collapse of the stockmarket, the ending of final salary schemes (including mine) and other belated admissions that we couldn't afford what we thought we could when old people died so much younger.
People aren't stupid. They know these things. See how the recent "death tax" tombstone ad backfired. Everyone knows there's a problem with social care for the elderly that the winning party must address. "Death tax" talk is crude, as Cameron will find if they try to tackle it – as they must.
As for Maurice and Charles's "I increased the gap between rich and poor vote for me" Brown poster, that is a jaw-dropping example of chutzpah that would probably be disbarred by the advertising standards authority.
The income/wealth gap in 1997 was dramatically wider than in 1979. Labour's efforts to close it have been conducted while running up a down escalator. The statistics are disputed, but valuable gains have been made at the bottom.
It's the escalating accumulation of wealth at the very top of the top that distorts the figures and much else. Yet the very newspapers that denounce Alistair Darling's "class warfare" efforts to claw some money back from the top 1% of earners or people buying £1m houses will also be the papers that parrot this allegation.
They already do. In today's Mail, my old chum Peter Oborne takes Labour's five pledges – the ones in the sunlit cornfield – and solemnly denounces them as "a mixture of pious aspiration, lies and outright fabrication. It is essential that they are exposed."
I'm sure it is and trust that other souls, equally zealous for the public good, will make a similarly selective analysis of Dave 'n' George's pledges. Me, I'll stick to chutzpah.
Meanwhile, my working hypothesis is that we all deplore negative advertising while being reluctant to admit, even to ourselves, that it often works. When does it work? When it strikes a chord with what voters already think and articulates half-felt impressions.
Thus the Tory "demon eyes" ad about Tony Blair in 1997, ridiculously camp I thought at the time, was laughed off in a way it might not have been in 2005. Whereas William Hague in a Thatcher wig (2001) was both witty and true – still is.
On the other hand, I have often written that Hague's "You paid the taxes, so where are the … " nurses, GPs, police officers, teachers etc poster was a very good one. It was just inappropriate in 2001 when voters were still giving Labour the benefit of the doubt and Billy themselves was crying "save the pound" up and down Britain.
Will Cameron's attacks on Brown work? It's too early to say, as it is to be sure – as some people claim to be – that George Osborne, who faces Darling and Vince Cable in tonight's C4 debate – is the Tory weak link.
When Patrick Wintour and Nicholas Watt interviewed the PM for Saturday's Guardian – at dawn in Brussels for the EU summit – they found them much more cheerful and outgoing than they could recall.
Make of that what you will. Perhaps they know that their fate will be decided – one way or the other – within the next month and is encouraged by the prospect of resolution, like a medieval knight facing single combat to resolve issues of courage and character which have dogged their life.
Either way, I'm still minded to say the Tories ought to win this election, negative posters or not, though they are doing their best to make it interesting – and to keep Gordon's spirits up.

In which everyone wants to be stomped by the swords of giant angels… except those four, of course.
Status: Confirmed
Chapter is titled “The Collection of Rukh”.
The spoilers start with Aladdin and the others back in their world, with them mentioning that the rukh are being drawn to some place. They also notice there is some sort of spell coming from under the IA HQ.
By the way, Nerva is there, but gets promptly ignored as the others head out. Eventually, Child!Arba comes out of the portal as well.
Arba says that the magic of the Sacred Palace has been activated, and they cannot really be enthusiastic about “those four”. The rukh is being collected. Starting from the place where the dimensional boundaries's are thinner, the world's map will be dyed in black. Basically, when the angel statues swing their swords, their surroundings change back into white rukh.
We then see images of the Dark Continent, Heliohapt, and Sindria, where everyone is supper happy about the giant statues killing everyone (and everything). Looking at this scene, Drakon reminiscences of the past, and they begin crying without realizing it. When Saher questions them about it, they suppose them to be tears of joy, but their figures are soon shown to be surrounded by chains (like Mor, I daresay).

However, before the sword of the statue they happily welcome can kill them, Alibaba intervenes and saves Drakon, Saher, and the others, much to their surprise.
Alibaba says that they won't let someone else to decide what they want to do, to which Aladdin, Hakuryuu, and Judar agree. The four of them will destroy these shinigami (death gods).
And that's the final update! Looks like there is a chance people will be snapped out of their conditioning, even though it's very slim.
Vasopressin, also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH), arginine vasopressin (AVP) or argipressin,[5] is a hormone synthesized as a peptide prohormone in neurons in the hypothalamus, and is converted to AVP. It then travels down the axon of that cell, which terminates in the posterior pituitary, and is released from vesicles into the circulation in response to extracellular fluid hypertonicity (hyperosmolality). AVP has two primary functions. First, it increases the amount of solute-free water reabsorbed back into the circulation from the filtrate in the kidney tubules of the nephrons. Second, AVP constricts arterioles, which increases peripheral vascular resistance and raises arterial blood pressure.[6][7][8]
A third function is possible. Some AVP may be released directly into the brain from the hypothalamus, and may play an important role in social behavior, sexual motivation and pair bonding, and maternal responses to stress.[9]
Vasopressin induces differential of stem cells into cardiomyocytes and promotes heart muscle homeostasis.[10]
It has a very short half-life, between 16–24 minutes.[8]
Physiology [ edit ]
Function [ edit ]
Vasopressin regulates the tonicity of body fluids. It is released from the posterior pituitary in response to hypertonicity and causes the kidneys to reabsorb solute-free water and return it to the circulation from the tubules of the nephron, thus returning the tonicity of the body fluids toward normal. An incidental consequence of this renal reabsorption of water is concentrated urine and reduced urine volume. AVP released in high concentrations may also raise blood pressure by inducing moderate vasoconstriction.
AVP also may have a variety of neurological effects on the brain. It may influence pair-bonding in voles. The high-density distributions of vasopressin receptor AVPr1a in prairie vole ventral forebrain regions have been shown to facilitate and coordinate reward circuits during partner preference formation, critical for pair bond formation.[11]
A very similar substance, lysine vasopressin (LVP) or lypressin, has the same function in pigs and is used in human AVP deficiency.[12]
Kidney [ edit ]
Vasopressin has three main effects which are
Central nervous system [ edit ]
Vasopressin released within the brain may have several actions:
Vasopressin is released into the brain in a circadian rhythm by neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. [16]
Vasopressin released from centrally projecting hypothalamic neurons is involved in aggression, blood pressure regulation, and temperature regulation. [ citation needed ]
Recent evidence suggests that vasopressin may have analgesic effects. The analgesia effects of vasopressin were found to be dependent on both stress and sex.[17]
Regulation [ edit ]
Many factors influence the secretion of vasopressin:
Ethanol (alcohol) reduces the calcium-dependent secretion of AVP by blocking voltage-gated calcium channels in neurohypophyseal nerve terminals in rats. [18]
Angiotensin II stimulates AVP secretion, in keeping with its general pressor and pro-volumic effects on the body. [19]
Atrial natriuretic peptide inhibits AVP secretion, in part by inhibiting Angiotensin II-induced stimulation of AVP secretion. [19]
Cortisol inhibits secretion of antidiuretic hormone.[20]
Production and secretion [ edit ]
The physiologic stimulus for secretion of vasopressin is increased osmolality of the plasma, monitored by the hypothalamus. A decreased arterial blood volume, (such as can occur in cirrhosis, nephrosis and heart failure), stimulates secretion, even in the face of decreased osmolality of the plasma: it supersedes osmolality, but with a milder effect. In other words, vasopressin is secreted in spite of the presence of hypoosmolality (hyponatremia) when the arterial blood volume is low.
The AVP that is measured in peripheral blood is almost all derived from secretion from the posterior pituitary gland (except in cases of AVP-secreting tumours). Vasopressin is produced by magnocellular neurosecretory neurons in the Paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) and Supraoptic nucleus (SON). It then travels down the axon through the infundibulum within neurosecretory granules that are found within Herring bodies, localized swellings of the axons and nerve terminals. These carry the peptide directly to the posterior pituitary gland, where it is stored until released into the blood.
There are other sources of AVP, beyond the hypothalamic magnocellular neurons. For example, AVP is also synthesized by parvocellular neurosecretory neurons of the PVN, transported and released at the median eminence, from which it travels through the hypophyseal portal system to the anterior pituitary, where it stimulates corticotropic cells synergistically with CRH to produce ACTH (by itself it is a weak secretagogue).[21]
Vasopressin during surgery and anaesthesia [ edit ]
Vasopressin is used for measurement of surgical stress at evaluation of surgical techniques. Plasma vasopressin concentration is elevated at noxious stimuli,[22][23] predominantly during abdominal surgery,[24][25][26] especially at gut manipulation and traction of viscera.[27][28][29]
Receptors [ edit ]
The following describes the actions of AVP:
Structure and relation to oxytocin [ edit ]
Chemical structure of the arginine vasopressin (argipressin) with an arginine at the 8th amino acid position. Lysine vasopressin differs only in having a lysine in this position.
The vasopressins are peptides consisting of nine amino acids (nonapeptides). (NB: the value in the table above of 164 amino acids is that obtained before the hormone is activated by cleavage.) The amino acid sequence of arginine vasopressin (argipressin) is Cys-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Asn-Cys-Pro-Arg-Gly-NH 2 , with the cysteine residues forming a disulfide bond and the C-terminus of the sequence converted to a primary amide.[36] Lysine vasopressin (lypressin) has a lysine in place of the arginine as the eighth amino acid, and is found in pigs and some related animals, whereas arginine vasopressin is found in humans.[37]
The structure of oxytocin is very similar to that of the vasopressins: It is also a nonapeptide with a disulfide bridge and its amino acid sequence differs at only two positions (see table below). The two genes are located on the same chromosome separated by a relatively small distance of less than 15,000 bases in most species. The magnocellular neurons that secrete vasopressin are adjacent to magnocellular neurons that secrete oxytocin, and are similar in many respects. The similarity of the two peptides can cause some cross-reactions: oxytocin has a slight antidiuretic function, and high levels of AVP can cause uterine contractions.[38][39]
Below is a table showing the superfamily of vasopressin and oxytocin neuropeptides:
Medical use [ edit ]
Vasopressin is used to manage anti-diuretic hormone deficiency. It has off-label uses and is used in the treatment of vasodilatory shock, gastrointestinal bleeding, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Vasopressin is used to treat diabetes insipidus related to low levels of antiduretic hormone. It is available as Pressyn.[41]
Vasopressin agonists are used therapeutically in various conditions, and its long-acting synthetic analogue desmopressin is used in conditions featuring low vasopressin secretion, as well as for control of bleeding (in some forms of von Willebrand disease and in mild haemophilia A) and in extreme cases of bedwetting by children. Terlipressin and related analogues are used as vasoconstrictors in certain conditions. Use of vasopressin analogues for esophageal varices commenced in 1970.[42]
Vasopressin infusions are also used as second line therapy for septic shock patients not responding to fluid resuscitation or infusions of catecholamines (e.g., dopamine or norepinephrine) to increase the blood pressure while sparing the use of catecholamines. These argipressins have much shorter elimination half-life (around 20 minutes) comparing to synthetic non-arginine vasopresines with much longer elimination half-life of many hours. Further, argipressins act on V1a, V1b, and V2 reseptors which consequently lead to higher eGFR and lower vascular resistance in the lungs. A number of injectable arginine vasopressins are currently in clinical use in the United States and in Europe.
Pharmacokinetics [ edit ]
Vasopressin is administered through an intravenous device, intramuscular injection or a subcutaneous injection. The duration of action depends on the mode of administration and ranges from thirty minutes to two hours. It has a half life of ten to twenty minutes. It is widely distributed throughout the body and remains in the extracellular fluid. It is degraded by the liver and excreted through the kidneys.[41] Arginin vasopressins for use in septic shock are intended for intravenous use only.
Side effects [ edit ]
The most common side effects during treatment with vasopressin are dizziness, angina, chest pain, abdominal cramps, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, trembling, fever, water intoxication, pounding sensation in the head, diarrhea, sweating, paleness, and flatulence. The most severe adverse reactions are myocardial infarction and hypersensitivy.[41]
Contraindications [ edit ]
The use of lysine vasopressin is contraindicated in the presence of hypersentivity to beef or pork proteins, increased BUN and chronic renal failure. It is recommended that it be cautiously used in instances of perioperative polyuria, sensitivity to the drug, asthma, seizures, heart failure, a comatose state, migraine headaches, and cardiovascular disease.[41]
Interactions [ edit ]
Role in disease [ edit ]
There may be a connection between arginine vasopressin and autism.[43]
Deficiency [ edit ]
Decreased AVP release (neurogenic — i.e. due to alcohol intoxication or tumour) or decreased renal sensitivity to AVP (nephrogenic, i.e. by mutation of V2 receptor or AQP) leads to diabetes insipidus, a condition featuring hypernatremia (increased blood sodium concentration), polyuria (excess urine production), and polydipsia (thirst).
Excess [ edit ]
Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH) in turn can be caused by a number of problems. Some forms of cancer can cause SIADH, particularly small cell lung carcinoma but also a number of other tumors. A variety of diseases affecting the brain or the lung (infections, bleeding) can be the driver behind SIADH. A number of drugs has been associated with SIADH, such as certain antidepressants (serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants), the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, oxytocin (used to induce and stimulate labor), and the chemotherapy drug vincristine. It has also been associated with fluoroquinolones (including ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin).[8] Finally, it can occur without a clear explanation.[44] Hyponatremia can be treated pharmaceutically through the use of vasopressin receptor antagonists.[44]
History [ edit ]
Vasopressin was elucidated and synthesized for the first time by Vincent du Vigneaud.
Animal studies [ edit ]
Evidence for an effect of AVP on monogamy vs promiscuity comes from experimental studies in several species, which indicate that the precise distribution of vasopressin and vasopressin receptors in the brain is associated with species-typical patterns of social behavior. In particular, there are consistent differences between monogamous species and promiscuous species in the distribution of AVP receptors, and sometimes in the distribution of vasopressin-containing axons, even when closely related species are compared.[45]
Human studies [ edit ]
Vasopressin has shown nootropic effects on pain perception and cognitive function.[46] Vasopressin also plays a role in autism, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.[47]

TOKYO -- Increased tensions over Ukraine are no longer someone else's problem for the government of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Japan has found itself in the middle of the fierce tug-of-war between the U.S. and Russia.
According to a Japanese government official, Washington said it is considering imposing economic sanctions on Russia and that it wants Tokyo to join in.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on March 2 indicated that the U.S. would weigh possible economic sanctions against Russia, which may include freezing overseas assets and partially suspending visa issuance. But the U.S. has not put all its cards on the table yet.
A Japanese national security official said, "We do not know the details of the planned sanctions yet. But if the U.S. and Europe cooperate, Japan will be forced to conform to them." The scenario is a problem for Abe, who is seeking to deepen relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and settle the long-standing dispute over the so-called Northern Territories, four islands north of Hokkaido that Soviet forces occupied in the closing days of World War II.
Abe can work along with the U.S. and Europe, but does not want to take a stern approach toward Russia to the extent of rupturing Japan-Russia relations. In fact, they are said to have mentioned such an intention to those close to him, and Japan is acting accordingly.
A joint statement condemning Russian's actions by leaders of the G-7 nations -- the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada -- was compiled by the U.S. and released on March 3. When shown a draft of the statement, Japanese officials asked to make modifications, including additional wording calling for all sides to exercise restraint. "Expressions were weakened so as not to overly provoke Russia," said a Japanese government official.
Germany, which depends on Russia for energy, is also taking a different approach from the U.S. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is insisting on dialogue with Russia, keeping a distance from U.S.'s hard-line stance.
But if Russia launches major military action in Ukraine, it will be more difficult for Japan and Germany to maintain their relations with Russia. Some conservative Republicans in the U.S. have even said that Japan should avoid being deeply involved in the Putin administration.
Charm offensive
Amid these circumstances, Putin has been working to prevent Japan from giving in to the U.S. pressure. Their efforts date back to the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Sochi in early February. There is a little-known story about Abe's attendance at the ceremonies. In late January, Japanese government officials were seeking ways for Abe to attend the ceremonies. But they were facing difficulties because they were unlikely to make it to the ceremonies no matter how much they hurried, due to scheduling conflicts with the ordinary session of the Diet.
But Putin did not lose hope, according to sources close to the Japanese and Russian governments. They arranged permission for the Japanese government aircraft to pass through Kazakhstan's territorial airspace so that it could take the shortest possible route from Tokyo to Sochi. Their preparations paid off and Abe arrived at the venue only about 10 minutes before the ceremonies began.
The following day, Putin had a luncheon meeting with Abe, treating them to three different kinds of the finest caviar and premium vodka. A Japanese expert in Russian affairs said, "Putin may have already envisaged taking tough measures against Ukraine back then. So they wined and dined Abe in a bid to prepare for a split between Washington and Tokyo."
Since then, questions have grown about how Japan should address the confrontation between the U.S. and Russia.
There is talk in the Abe government that Tokyo wants to avoid a situation where China and Russia join hands via their shared territorial and historical issues and increase pressure on Japan. But the government is also worried that if the unity between Japan and the U.S. is impaired due to ties with Russia, it could result in a toughening of China's hard-line policy toward Japan.
Abe is considering sending Shotaro Yachi, head of the secretariat of Japan's new National Security Council, to Russia within this month. Some say that Putin, who wants to disrupt the relationship among Japan, the U.S. and Europe, will meet them in person.

People around the world continue to live longer, and in some poor countries the gains have been dramatic, the World Health Organization says in an annual report released Thursday.
The average girl born in 2012 can expect to reach 73 and the average boy can expect to reach 68. That gives them an average of six years more than children born in 1990, WHO says.
The United States does better than average, with a female life expectancy of 81 and male life expectancy of 76 – but ranks 37th overall and does not make the top 10 for either gender. Top honors go to Japan for women (87 years) and Iceland for men (81.2 years).
The best-improved countries include several that have made double-digit gains since 1990. Those include Liberia, which saw a 20-year increase (from 42 to 62); Ethiopia (from 45 to 64), Maldives (58 to 77), Cambodia (54 to 72), Timor-Leste (also known as East Timor) (50 to 66) and Rwanda (48 to 65).
WHO says several factors are at work:
• In poor countries, fewer children are dying before age 5, thanks to advances against premature birth, birth complications and childhood infections.
• In rich countries, fewer people are dying of heart disease and stroke before reaching 60, thanks to blood pressure control and other preventive efforts.
• In many countries, declining tobacco use is extending lives.
The news is not all good. Life expectancy remains below 55 years in nine countries, all in sub-Saharan Africa: Angola, Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lesotho, Mozambique, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.
Also, the gap between rich and poor countries remains large: A boy born in a rich country can expect to live to 76, which is 16 years longer than a boy born in a poor country. For girls, the gap is 19 years: 82 vs. 63.
The top 10 countries for female life expectancy
1. Japan: 87.0 years
2. Spain: 85.1 years
3. Switzerland: 85.1 years
4. Singapore: 85.1 years
5. Italy: 85.0 years

The Golden Plates, Inscribed with the Word of God in 'Reformed Egyptian'
On September 22, 1823, Joseph Smith claims an angel named Moroni revealed to him, among other artifacts, a set of 40-60 pound golden plates "under a stone of considerable size" near their father's farm. Four years later - and eighteen months after being convicted for fraud and admitting in court they told people they had "necromantic" powers - Smith says Moroni allowed them to take the plates home and translate them from "reformed Egyptian" into English, thus creating the Book of Mormon.
Yes, the replica above looks like a modern three-ring binder, but that's what Smith said they looked like. At first, they wouldn't let anyone else look at them. If they did, they'd die, Raiders of the Lost Ark- style. Later, Smith had a revelation that more people could safely see the plates, and eventually a total of eleven "witnesses" claimed to have seen them. Once the translation was complete, Smith said Moroni retrieved the plates and took them back to heaven, where they reportedly still reside today.
BOSTON -- The state's medical marijuana program is projected to run a $1.17 million deficit in fiscal year 2015 despite a state law requiring the program to pay for itself, according to the program's annual report.
Nichole Snow, deputy director of Massachusetts Patient Advocacy Alliance, a medical marijuana patient advocacy group, said the deficit "shows that the people who were in charge originally really didn't put enough thought into it."
Scott Zoback, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, said, "The administration is in the process of revamping a poorly functioning medical marijuana program it inherited in order to best serve patients safely and ensure the system is living up to the law passed by Massachusetts voters."
According to projections in a report released March 1, the fund that operates the medical marijuana program is expected to take in $1.74 million this fiscal year, which includes a surplus from last year. The money comes primarily from registration and renewal fees from dispensaries and patients. Dispensaries must pay $50,000 a year to operate, while patients pay $50 annually.
Expenses, however, are expected to be $2.9 million, with the bulk of that going to information technology and staff salaries.
The annual report attributes the deficit to several factors. First, the department originally gave provisional approval to 20 dispensaries, but after problems emerged with some applications, it narrowed that number down to 15. So, the registration fees were lower than expected. The original budget had not accounted for one-time startup costs associated with creating a new industry. Additionally, the development of an online registration system cost far more than originally anticipated.
Cheryl Bartlett, the Department of Public Health commissioner under former governor Deval Patrick, who implemented the state's medical marijuana licensing program, resigned in October and now works at Cape Cod Healthcare. A spokesperson for Cape Cod Healthcare said Bartlett was unavailable for comment.
Voters legalized medical marijuana in a 2012 ballot initiative. State law requires there to be a separate fund to administer the medical marijuana program, with program expenses being paid by fees generated from the dispensaries and from patient registration.
In fiscal year 2014, which ended in June, the fund had a surplus of approximately $400,000, which rolled over into 2015. That year, the program raised $3.8 million, mostly from application fees, while recording expenses of $3.4 million. Most of that spending went to outside consultants for things like background checks and application scoring and to building an online registration system to track patients and caregivers.
The Massachusetts Patient Advocacy Alliance has been critical of how long the medical marijuana licensing process has taken, and Snow said the deficit is another consequence of a process that was too stringent.
"They were spending money on God knows what, and it wasn't to make any progress," Snow said. "They spent money that just wasn't there."
A spokesperson for a trade association representing several of the state's licensed dispensaries declined to comment.
The projected deficit is only the latest setback for a program that has been beset by problems. There have been lawsuits by unsuccessful medical marijuana companies, though judges have generally found in favor of the state. Applications that were provisionally approved were found to have problems, such as overstated levels of local support or officers who had trouble running dispensaries in other states. But when the state put the licensing process on hold to do additional checks, patient advocates complained of delays.
Department of Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel, who was appointed by Gov. Charlie Baker, announced recently that the administration is revamping the licensing process. The new process will allow dispensaries to apply for licenses on a rolling basis, and each one will be scored individually. Previously, the state set deadlines for applications, then analyzed the entire group simultaneously.
Those familiar with the process say this could increase revenue in the coming years, since there could be more potential licensees submitting applications, and each application comes with a fee.
The report, written before the change, said the program is expected to cover its costs in 2016.
Over the past two years, the Department of Public Health has reviewed 181 applications for dispensaries and conducted 600 background checks. So far, just two organizations have received the final approvals needed to grow marijuana. A Salem-based dispensary could open this spring and a Northampton-based dispensary is slated to open this fall.
So far, there are 14,000 certified patients, 7,100 of whom have registered with the state. Registration is required to legally possess medical marijuana.
State Sen. Jason Lewis, D-Winchester, has been appointed to chair a special committee to examine issues surrounding marijuana, in light of a ballot campaign to legalize the drug in 2016. Lewis, through a spokesperson, declined to comment on the deficit.
Nationally, states with medical marijuana programs have generally raised enough money to cover expenses, and in some cases have generated surpluses, according to a report by the pro-marijuana Marijuana Policy Project. However, many of the states do not rely only on fees, but also impose a sales tax on medical marijuana. The Massachusetts program does not include a sales tax.
Owl Coloring Page – Here's a great question for you…did you know that a group of owls is called a parliament? I totally would have failed that question on an exam. It's been a while now since I've made a coloring page so I decided to draw a “parliament” of owls for all of our owl fans out there. We love to draw and color in our home – even my husband, who's main artistic skill is drawing stick men, enjoys getting in on a little coloring action. I often send a variety of coloring pages home with Noelle's friends when they visit – always a hit. I've had a number of mom friends tell me that the coloring pages have saved their sanity while traveling, at weddings, on ferries, camping or when mom just needs a moment of peace and quiet. Some of my teacher friends use these pages in their classes when their kids have finished all their work or to leave for substitute teachers. I'm so happy that people make such great use of these coloring pages. If you have any theme requests for future coloring pages, please let me know.

BOSTON (The Borowitz Report)—America cast its historic vote today, sending Barack and Michelle Obama back to the White House while sending Mitt and Ann Romney back to 1954.
The election meant the end of the road for Mr. Romney, who had been actively seeking the Presidency for the past sixty-five years.
Addressing supporters at the Boston Convention Center, Mr. Romney called their defeat tonight “bittersweet”: “On one hand, I lost the election. But on the other hand, I'll never have to show anyone my taxes.”
If they had won tonight, Mr. Romney would have become the first man elected President after telling half of the country to screw themselves.
Vice-Presidential nominee Paul Ryan addressed the subject of their defeat in characteristic style, telling supporters that they had won.

There has been a great deal of attention during the recently-concluded election cycle about the supposed racism of President-elect Donald Trump. The talk of a southern border wall and making Mexico pay for it, rapists and murderers trickling in from Mexico, and a Muslim ban have been huge contributing stories this cycle. It was for these reasons that many not only expected the Republican President-elect to fail, but to fail miserably.
Donald Trump is now the President-elect, however.
The transition team is in full swing and, as the Trump Administration begins to take shape, the direction of policy will begin coming together. This could mean a border wall, deportations of illegal immigrants, and a Muslim ban.
But it could also mean far worse than this comes to light.
There is now talk of a Muslim registry to track those who enter the country from certain foreign lands. This has become a cause for alarm among a number of different groups for various reasons. This could lead to invasions of privacy, increased surveillance state, more Orwellian legislation, and institutionalized racism.
Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach first made waves by suggesting such a database was being considered by the forming Trump Administration. The alarm began to sound louder than Chris Higbie, a former Navy SEAL and Trump supporter, suggested that Japanese Internment Camps create the legal precedent the President-elect needs here.
The problem is Higbie is absolutely correct.
Korematsu v. United States was a 1944 Supreme Court case involving the arrest of Japanese American Fred Korematsu. Korematsu was born to Japanese parents in Oakland, California. Being a born and raised American, they refused to comply with the relocation order on grounds that it violated the Fifth Amendment.
The Supreme Court would ultimately rule against Korematsu in a shocking case. The bench stacked by then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt predictably sided with the President. Roosevelt appointee Justice Hugo Black wrote the decision, which contradicted itself by stating the exclusion order wasn't racist before proceeding to explain why the decision was based on their race.
A number of precedents were set forth by the internment of the Japanese Americans and the Supreme Court supporting it.
First, the Supreme Court legalized discrimination based on race to an extreme. Wartime paranoia is a legally justifiable reason to disregard the rights of American citizens.
Second, the Supreme Court legalized forced relocation and other extreme measures as a means to handle racist wartime paranoia.
Fred Korematsu was an American citizen. They should have been guaranteed their rights under the Constitution, but they were overridden and the court sided with the abuse of power by the Roosevelt Administration.
Note that legality and morality are separate topics. Just because it is legal does not make it right. But it's important to understand that the general point advanced by former Navy SEAL Chris Higbie is correct. The legal precedents for these things are real.
Americans need to understand the real threat that wartime poses to our country. It doesn't only wear down our military, but it breaks down our liberty at home. It is for this reason that the Bill of Rights exists. Whether you're a Japanese American or a Muslim American, constitutional protections exist to safeguard us from tyrannical paranoia.
Korematsu v. United States needs to be reversed and overturned.

For the second time in as many days, shots rang out following a party near Florida A&M University Saturday morning.
Just after 1 a.m., 20-year-old FAMU mechanical engineering student Quinton Langford was shot and killed, according to Tallahassee Police.
Langford, from Plant City, was in a crowd of people leaving a party near the corner of Gamble and Perry streets. Another man, 19-year-old Landsey Elisson was injured in the shooting and is being treated at a local hospital.
It is unclear if Elisson is a student.
The intersection runs next to a FAMU dorm in the heart of campus, which is celebrating its homecoming this weekend.
A flood of online support for Langford, marked by calls for an end to senseless gun violence, came on the heels of the news they had died.
“Not even the good college kids are safe anymore,” wrote Kenneth J. Griffin in a Facebook post. “He was so excited to be a Rattler.”
Other remarked how gun violence has marked homecoming week.
“RIP to Quinton Langford a fellow Rattler, who was sent to Tallahassee to pursue their education not to get killed for nothing!” wrote Leondra Cierra. “This (homecoming) has been filled with gun violence and it's so sad because we just want a break from our academic life and have fun!”
The news comes a day after another shooting at an apparent house party just off FAMU 's campus. Two were wounded in that incident, but both are expected to recover.
TPD's Violent Crimes and Forensic units are continuing to investigate both shootings.
Anyone with information about either case is asked to call TPD at (850) 891-4200 or if they wish to remain anonymous, please call Crime Stoppers at (850) 574-TIPS.

STATEMENT FROM FAMU
At about 12:30 a.m. on Sunday morning, FAMU sent out this news release about the student who was killed in a weekend shooting.
Two Florida A&M University (FAMU) students were shot during an off-campus incident early Saturday morning. The Tallahassee Police Department (TPD) reports Quinton Langford, 20, received medical treatment at the scene but succumbed to injuries. Twenty-year-old Landsay Elisson was transported to Tallahassee Memorial Hospital where they underwent surgery.
Tallahassee police responded to reports of gunfire at approximately 1:15 a.m., in the area of Gamble and Perry Streets. According to authorities, it appears that a large party was ending when someone fired shots into the crowd, injuring the students.
FAMU's Interim President Larry Robinson, Ph.D., said, “Quinton was a strong student leader. We extend condolences and prayers to their family, and will keep Landsay and their family in our prayers.”
Langford was a construction engineering technology major and president of the FAMU student chapter of the Associated General Contractors of America. They were also taught by Associate Dean and Director of Engineering Technology Yves Anglade, Ph.D.
In response to Langford's passing, Anglade said, “I was devastated when I heard it. They got along with everybody. They were very friendly.”
The TPD investigator in charge of the case is asking anyone who was at the scene but did not speak with police officers to call 850-891-4200. Investigators say they hope a witness will come forward with information that may lead to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the shooting. Anyone who would prefer to remain anonymous should call Crime Stoppers at 850-574-TIPS.

Ahead of a new public preview for Windows Server 2016, which is expected sometime next week, screenshots have leaked of build 10514. Wzor posted a series of screenshots detailing the installation of Technical Preview 3 on their website earlier today.
From the screenshots, it's clear that this build is from the public development th2_release branch, which is the same branch that Insiders received 10512 for Windows 10 Mobile earlier this week. TH2 (Threshold 2) is set to launch in October, but Windows Server 2016 isn't rumored for release until early next year. Regardless, TH2 (or Update 1) is the next update in line for Windows 10 users, and Microsoft is expected to kick off a preview for that very soon.
No firm date has been set for the release of Windows Server 2016, although it is expected to ship in early 2016. You can view a bunch more screenshots of the Technical Preview here.

Ah, Barrett-Jackson's Scottsdale auction, where historic American muscle comes to be revived and sold for too much money. Invariably, manufacturers get into the act, selling the first examples of cars they hope will be known as future classics. This year, Shelby American is showing up to the party with its reconstituted Terlingua Racing Team Mustang.
You might remember Shelby's last stab at a Terlingua-themed car, featuring a boosted V-6 making up to 375 horsepower. But that was a decade ago, and stodgy old Cadillac is pushing 464 horses out of a V-6 now. Predictably, Shelby got radical, built on its Super Snake package, and is offering the Terlingua model with a wholly sensible, Hellcat-stomping “750-plus” horsepower from a supercharged version of the Mustang GT's Coyote 5.0.
For those not hip to the whole Terlingua thing: If you want a real sense of the place, drive out to Alpine, Texas. It's the home of Sul Ross State University, friendly folks, and whole houses that have inventively grown out of trailers. Then take State Route 118 south until you're nearly in Mexico. There's not a whole lot to Terlingua. It's a gift shop and a graveyard set up against the mountainous terrain of the Big Bend. But it's near here that Carroll Shelby owned a ranch, and it's here that they helped establish a renowned chili cook-off in 1967. Stop into the gift shop and buy a “Ski Terlingua” coffee mug, featuring a skeleton bombing down a mountain. State Route 118, by the way, is a great road in a fast car. Just don't go blowing through the Border Patrol checkpoint.

In the mid-1960s, Shelby, Bill Neale, and a few other miscreants banded together and founded the Terlingua Racing Team. In 1967, Jerry Titus, known as “Mr. Trans-Am,” won the SCCA's prestigious pony-car series behind the wheel of a Terlingua-liveried Mustang. And now you, the aged guy with the cash for a new GT, plus 66 large to hand over to Shelby American, can pootle around the streets in a car making significantly more power than Titus's car ever did. To handle the grunt power, the new Terlinguas will get Ford Performance half-shafts. To help them exhale, they'll get Borla exhausts. Brembo is onboard to provide stopping power, and manual-equipped cars get short-throw shifters.
This Strawberry Cheesecake Trifle is one of those make-in-advance crowd pleasing desserts. It's filled with sweet strawberries, cubed cake and a homemade vanilla cheesecake mousse. I literally make this year-round when I can get my hands on sweet strawberries. It's a given it will show-up during the glorious strawberry picking season, but the colors make it perfection at Christmas, too.
To assemble this confection, I recommend starting with cubed cake, then strawberries then vanilla cheesecake mousse in that order. Depending on the size and depth of the trifle bowl used, the layers could come together differently, so consider the size of the bowl you're using when separating the ingredients into layers. This strawberry cheesecake trifle is a fun dessert to make and serve and there's never ever a spoonful leftover.

Movie posters are art and, unfortunately, the forgotten one. In the early years of cinema history, they were used just like advertising material. Displayed in theatres only, movie posters had the same function as a menu in a restaurant: what feast can I enjoy this evening? Nowadays, movie posters play a big role in cinema memorabilia collection. They have lost the “informative” tone to wear a more artistic and decorative dress. We want to change it with this post.

Made in many different sizes and versions, and released in different moments all along a movie's life, posters immortalize in one static image the feeling and the atmosphere of a motion picture. Some posters can be dark or try to frighten the audience, others bedazzling with bright colors; some can be someway informative, while others can be fully teasing and may provide you only the date when movie will be released, even if you may not know what the movie is about.
In this post we present you a showcase of 50 beautiful movie posters. We went through different decades of movie history and different genre, different graphical approach, colors and style. Movies the posters are about may be famous or not, this is not the point. Movie posters put together the love for for two different visual arts: cinema and graphics. Enjoy!

Tim Sherwood: Confident Spurs can make an impact in the second half of the season
Spurs confirmed their former player and Head of Football Development as Andre Villas-Boas' full-time successor on Monday, the day after they oversaw victory at Southampton in their first league game.
"It's an honour to be head coach of this top club," they told Spurs' official website. "It's a club that means an awful lot to me and it's a proud moment.
"I've known it from the grass roots right up towards the first team, worked at every level of the football club and played here, so I know it better than most and hopefully that will stand me in good stead taking this club forward."
They added: "If you cut me in half, I bleed the colour of the club."
Sherwood's first home league game in charge will be against West Brom on Boxing Day, with Spurs looking to close the four-point gap on the top-four and they insist they will stick to attacking principles now they have the job on a full-time basis.
"Every game is tough," said Sherwood. "They've got an interim manager at the moment and hopefully the uncertainty in their squad can put us on the right track.
"But it's always about what you do. If you're too worried about the opposition you take your eye off your own preparations.
"We've got good players in the football club and if we apply ourselves well, get the players playing as they can and the right players on the ball in the correct areas, we can hurt any team in this league."
Pentagon Provides Updates on Support for Operations in Yemen, Somalia
Pentagon spokesperson Navy Capt. Jeff Davis updated the press here today on U.S. operations with local partners in Yemen against al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and in Somalia against al-Shabab.
In Yemen's Shabwah Governorate yesterday, according to the United Arab Emirates' Ambassador to the United States, Yemeni government armed forces launched a major operation against al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula with support from the UAE and U.S. forces.
Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula
Today, Davis said, a small number of U.S. forces “are supporting our regional counterterrorism partners in ongoing operations in Yemen against [al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula] to degrade the group's ability to coordinate external terrorist operations and to use Yemen territory as a safe place for terror plotting.”
Shabwah Governorate has a heavy al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula presence, they added.
U.S. support in this part of Yemen is a continuation of what U.S. forces have been doing there since Jan. 29, when a raid by U.S. forces killed an estimated 14 al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula terrorists.
According to a U.S. Central Command news release at the time, “the raid is one in a series of aggressive moves against terrorist planners in Yemen and worldwide,” and that similar operations have produced intelligence on al-Qaida logistics, recruiting and financing efforts.
U.S. support to the Yemeni people enhances stabilization efforts in the region, they added, noting that eliminating the influence of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in the region “will significantly degrade extremist activity in the area and set conditions for stabilization efforts in Yemen.”
Davis said U.S. forces continue to conduct air strikes in Yemen against terrorist targets.
“Since Feb. 28 we've conducted more than 80 strikes against [al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula] militants, infrastructure, fighting positions and equipment, and this is based upon the authorities granted in the operation that began” with the January raid, they said.
Al-Shabab in Somalia
On July 30, U.S. forces took part in a raid near Tortoroow in southern Somalia that targeted a senior member of al-Shabab.
“We can now confirm,” Davis said, “that the strike killed one of al-Shabab's senior leaders, Ali Mohammed Hussein, also known as Ali Jabal.”
The senior al-Shabab terrorist was one of the organization's leaders, they added, responsible for leading al-Shabab forces operating in the Mogadishu and Banadir regions, and planning and executing attacks against the Somali capital, Mogadishu.
Hussein used the Lower Shabelle region, a known al-Shabab safe haven, as a hub for these activities, Davis said, adding that their removal disrupts al-Shabab's ability to plan and conduct attacks in Mogadishu and to coordinate efforts among al-Shabab regional commanders.
“We continue to work there in Somalia in coordination with our partners with the Somali Defense Forces and other allies,” they said, “to systematically dismantle al-Shabab and to help achieve and bring stability and security throughout the region.”

Senator Bernie Sanders said on Friday that they will vote for Hillary Clinton in the November presidential election, offering one more indication that they have given up on their own candidacy.
Asked if they would cast their vote for Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, in an interview on MSNBC's “Morning Joe” program, Mr. Sanders said, “Yes.”
They added that the alternative, Donald J. Trump, would be dire for the country: “The issue right here is I'm going to do everything I can do to defeat Donald Trump. I think Trump, in so many ways, would be a disaster for this country if they were elected.”
Mr. Sanders has previously signaled that they would work with Mrs. Clinton to defeat Mr. Trump, and on Wednesday they acknowledged that “it doesn't appear” that he'll be the Democratic nominee when the party gathers for its convention next month. But they have thus far refused to suspend their presidential bid or stop campaigning. They had a campaign rally in New York City on Thursday night, and similar events are scheduled in Albany and Syracuse on Friday.
Mel Gibson allegedly ranted against "wetbacks" on tape. Previous tirades include the N-word and anti-Semitism. Wouldn't it be nice if you could read every terrible thing Gibson has said, all in one place? Look no further. Updated with more quotes!
We have compiled the Bible of terrible Mel Gibson quotes. (And Mel Gibson loves Bibles, because "there is no salvation for those outside the Church.") We're sure he's said more and worse. These are merely the terrible things he's said near an open microphone, tapped telephone, police officer, or journalist:
"I will report them to the fucking people that take fucking money from the wetbacks." — phone conversation with ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva, about an employee, via Update: a href="http://gawker.com/5585841/third-horrifying-mel-gibson-phone-call-is-now-online">Listen to it here.
"You look like a fucking pig in heat, and if you get raped by a pack of niggers, it will be your fault." — phone conversation with Grigorieva, via Update: "Pig in heat" or "bitch in heat"? Listen to it here.
"I am going to come and burn the fucking house down... but you will blow me first." — phone conversation with Grigorieva, via Update: Listen to it here.
"You know what, you fucking deserved it." — to Grigorieva after they asked, "What kind of man is that who would hit a woman when they are holding a child in their hands, hitting them twice in the face?" via Update: Listen to it here.
"Fucking Jews... The Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world… Are you a Jew?" — to male police officer during 2006 DUI arrest, via
"What do you think you're looking at, sugar tits?" — to female police officer during 2006 DUI arrest, via
"I want to kill him…I want their intestines on a stick… I want to kill their dog." —on New York Times reporter Frank Rich, who criticized The Passion of the Christ, to The New Yorker in 2003, via, h/t
"I own Malibu… I am going to fuck you." — to arresting officer during 2006 DUI, via
"Look what you did to me... look what you are... look what every part of you is... fucking fake... fucking fake… You are the most synthetic person... who the fuck are you?" — phone conversation with Grigorieva, via
"They take it up the ass. [laughs, stands up, bends over, points to anus] This is only for taking a shit." —to Spanish newspaper El Pais when asked what they think of gays, in 1991, via
"With this look, who's going to think I'm gay? I don't lend myself to that type of confusion. Do I look like a homosexual? Do I talk like them? Do I move like them?" —from the El Pais interview, via
"I'll apologize when hell freezes over. They can fuck off." —to Playboy in 1995, about whether he'd issue an apology to gays and lesbians, as GLAAD recommended
"I am one tough motherfucker and you can't bother me anymore. You ask anybody what their number one fear is and it's public humiliation. Multiply that on a global scale and that's what I've been through. It changes you and makes you one tough motherfucker. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger." — interview with The Telegraph and perhaps the most frightening quote of all, explaining why, no matter how much we abhor, ridicule, and shun this man, we will never be able to get rid of him.

Ragh Zel stepped over the crumbling stone, Slepkava swaying as they walked. Blood dripped from the steel, and Ragh's grey eyes were locked on one thing. To say murder was in their eyes would be to demean the fury kept in check inside the prince. As they came to the top of the ruined staircase, they grabbed hold of Otral's white cloak, pulling the man up to their eye level.
"I'm done with you, Otral." They rumbled like thunder. While the commander kept their face still, their golden eyes belied true terror. Ragh flicked Slepkava, and the blade reverted to dagger form. They pushed it against the man they used to call their friend's throat. The gold eyes shifted to the dagger, and sweat beaded on their slate grey forehead. "I think that this time, I'll let you live." They continued. "But if you ever- ever- come near me again with Maneth's orders pushing you forwards, I'll slaughter you like a pig." They narrowed their eyes. "Understood?" They lifted a white eyebrow. Otral nodded a little, as much as they could spare to with Slepkava already drawing blood. Ragh sheathed the dagger in the holster at their hip, and they turned away.
"You're making a mistake, Ragh." Otral hacked. Ragh glanced back over their shoulder before turning altogether. They gestured to the ruins, hands outstretched. Blood covered their gloves, and more stained the leather vest strapped to their chest.
"Do you see this? This is Ntir. Not that city out there, where the mazak lived, where our people live now. This is our legacy, Otral. And Maneth lets it fall to ruin. In the countless hours I've spent with the man, he's not even bothered to step into these ruins to do more than retrieve their throne. Isn't that fitting?" They paused for a moment. Otral looked confused. "Our people are dying, Otral. They die now, and they died in the Deep. They'll die so long as Tagh Maneth, the King of Justice, sits of the Ebony Throne. They don't care, Otral. I fought for months, now more than a year, slaughtering the people I thought butchered our people and stole our empire. But they don't even know. They've forgotten us, Otral, and Maneth doesn't care. They think that if he's got their throne, if he's got their empire, then justice is done. But I don't think it's justice that we punish these people for their ancestors' crimes." They paused again, turning away and starting down the path to the gates of the city. "Think about that, Otral. I think I'll try to find more of our people who think like me. And if you think I'm right, then you can come find me. Only then." They turned towards the path again and started down the stairs.
Halfway down, they heard the distinctive chink of chain loops against one another, the sound of armor moving. They stopped, breathing in the dank smells of the old city. Was Otral moving to come with him, or to come kill him? The next sound was the hiss of steel against steel, the sound of Otral's steel sheath and their blades. Ragh clenched their jaw and gripped Slepkava tightly. They closed their eyes as the sound of Otral's boots echoed through the air, coming closer and closer as time seemed to slow. Ragh hummed the Song as they drew the blade, closing their eyes and lunging as Slepkava extended with a hiss and Otral barrelled closer.
Warm blood ran down the hilt, washing over their hands. Otral gagged as blood filled their throat, and the young man's corpse collapsed onto Ragh's shoulders. The Prince of Vengeance fell to their knees, cradling their friend's corpse as tears ran down their face. The man's eyes still shone gold.
"It didn't have to be like this, Otral." For a moment, everything was silent.
"Yes it did." The dying man moaned.
First it was bureaucratic requests for paperwork to be completed correctly, now Al-Qaeda has created a complaints department.
In an apparent move to demonstrate how it is willing to participate in free government, the militant group has announced its headquarters in north-eastern Syria will be open for business to anyone who has a complaint.
Mokhtar Belmokhtar broke away from Al-Qaeda in North Africa to form their own cell.
"Any one who might have a complaint against any element of the Islamic state, whether the Emir or an ordinary soldier, can come and submit their complaint in any headquarters building of the Islamic state," the notice said, according to the Telegraph.
The report added that Al-Qaeda has promised to "ensure accountability for anyone committing violations" and those responsible would be sent to court.

The move is associated with the militant group's recent foray into north-east Syria and its occupation of the city of Raqqa.
The department's creation comes about a week after letters revealed that terrorist Moktar Belmoktar broke from Al-Qaeda North African branch, to form their own cell, after refusing to answer their boss' phone calls, hand in employee expense forms and ignoring orders and meetings.
Dead Space 3's microtransaction model didn't go over well with gamers, but it hasn't deterred the publisher one bit. EA's financial officer Blake Jorgensen has revealed all of its games will feature some form of micro-payments.
The quotes come from a Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference discussion we reported on earlier. Our previous coverage revealed that EA feels assured of its readiness for next-gen, promising some big things on the horizon.
OXM has since spotted another interesting quote from Jorgensen regarding EA's approach to micro-payments.
Said Jorgensen, “We are building into all of our games the ability to pay for things along the way; to get to a higher level. And consumers are enjoying and embracing that way of business.”
EA's chief technology officer Rajat Taneja is overseeing the move. Jorgensen added that Taneja's team views microtransactions as a key feature moving forward, and they have decided to take payment models in-house, instead of outsourcing them as they used to.
Added Jorgensen, “If you're doing microtransactions and you're processing credit cards for every one of those microtransactions you'll get eaten alive. And so Rajat's team has built an amazing backend to manage that and manage that much more profitably. We've outsourced a lot of that stuff historically; we're bringing that all in-house now.”
So there we go. Could Dead Space 3's micro-payment model be par for the course moving forward? We already know that the EA-published Real Racing 3 has gone big on micro-transactions as well, much to the scorn of fans.
What's your take?
“I believe power-sharing is best for our democracy and province, and that's why I want to see proportional representation implemented.” — B.C. NDP Premier John Horgan.
Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners ‘Punch to the Gut' Musical on Residential Schools Returns to Vancouver Children of God has been shaped by intense audience reactions, says director Corey Payette.
Let's face it: the first-past-the-post voting system that we use provincially and federally here in Canada is outdated, confusing and no longer fit for purpose. It fosters toxic, adversarial politics. And it's a relic from the past — Canada remains the last developed democracy on Earth to not adopt any form of proportional governance.
But that's about to change.
Last year, the voters of Prince Edward Island opted to discard the obsolete first-past-the-post electoral system in favour of proportional representation. And next year, British Columbians will go to the polls to decide whether they too wish to adopt a modern voting system that promotes collaboration and consensus above venom and vitriol.
Inevitably, there will be calls from a small minority of voices — particularly those deeply entrenched within B.C. politics — to retain our flawed, first-past-the-post voting system. But as the years pass, these voices become fewer, their arguments increasingly laboured and tenuous as the opinion of society turns against them.
Regular Tyee columnist Bill Tieleman is perhaps the most vociferous voice among those who resist electoral reform here in B.C. Earlier this week, The Tyee published Tieleman's attempt to discredit proportional representation. Surprisingly absent was anything positive about the current voting system. Tieleman's tactic is to dress up change as the boogeyman and hope to scare British Columbians away from adopting a better alternative.
But Tieleman's arguments are mostly spurious. They probably hope that the lengthy list of problems with our current first-past-the-post voting system doesn't become part of the conversation.
Let's begin by deconstructing some of Tieleman's dubious attempts to scare us from proportional representation. First, they claim that abandoning first-past-the-post would mean the end of perpetual majority governments, which they assure us would be a terrible thing. But does first-past-the-post always result in majority governments? Nine of the last 20 federal governments have been minorities. And with the advent of the B.C. Greens as a major political force, minority government is about to become much more common here provincially.
Tieleman is correct that proportional representation would certainly spell the end of single-party majority governments — but that would be a positive transformation. Most majority governments elected under first-past-the-post are actually “false majorities,” in which one party acquires full power over a parliament despite only earning a minority of voters' support — sometimes as low as just 38 per cent. One party winning unilateral power from such small support often results in ideological decisionmaking that benefits few. It also causes wild lurches between hard-left and hard-right as the government swings back and forth between polar opposites like a pendulum over the years. One government builds social programs, only for the next government to tear many of them down, resulting in colossal waste. In the long-term, this results in social instability — with the most vulnerable people often forced into destitution — as well as economic uncertainty. Clearly, single-party majority government is overrated.
Next, Tieleman would have us believe that proportional representation leads to dependence on small parties that acquire disproportionate power. It's disingenuous to brush off the B.C. Greens as a fringe party when they earned almost 17 per cent of the vote — nearly half the amount of the B.C. NDP or the B.C. Liberals — despite pressure on British Columbians to vote strategically for the two biggest parties. Tieleman likes to refer to the Greens' seat count of three rather than their popular vote to minimize their appearance, but let's remember that the Greens today have more seats than the NDP did in 2001.
As for Tieleman's general claim that small parties hold excessive power under proportionality: it's nonsense. The inclusion of small parties in government isn't a necessity under minority governments or proportional representation. Nothing prevents the two largest political parties from working together. That exact scenario happened right here in British Columbia from 1945 to 1952. Likewise, nothing formally stopped the B.C. NDP and B.C. Liberals from working together after the May election.
Think such collaboration is impossible? Look to the UK government of 2010 to 2015: two parties on opposite sides of the political spectrum worked together, even without proportional voting. This example also illustrates that the largest party dominates coalitions. The Conservatives implemented most of their policies, while the smaller Liberal Democrats only saw a few of their ideas come to fruition. Even in Tieleman's example of New Zealand, the larger National party clearly commands the coalition policy agenda. Their assertion that smaller parties will unduly call the shots in government as “hostagetakers” bears no resemblance to reality.
If the B.C. NDP wants to pass legislation under the current minority government (or under proportional representation), it needs the support of another party. That doesn't have to be the Greens. The NDP and Liberals could cooperate to ensure bills get through the legislature, as could the Liberals and Greens. No single party can dictate legislation on its own — resulting in greater cooperation and compromise than we've witnessed over the past half-century here in B.C. Legislation becomes pragmatic rather than dogmatic, and enjoys the support of a genuine majority of British Columbian voters. We should embrace, rather than fear, minority government.
Tieleman also suggests that switching to proportional voting would result in tenuous governments filled with numerous fringe parties, yet New Zealand's parliament hasn't prematurely collapsed even once since the country switched to proportional voting. In fact, under the mixed-member proportional (MMP) system, New Zealand has been more stable than Canada under first-past-the-post. Only four parties in New Zealand enjoy more than five per cent support of the electorate — fewer than here federally in Canada. The suggestion that MMP will cause havoc and instability simply isn't based on fact.
Tieleman's tone is scornful toward any party that is not subservient to the B.C. NDP. This is a manifestation of the toxicity from first-past-the-past voting, that other parties are treated as enemies rather than potential allies. It's ironic that this week they bemoaned the NDP having to cooperate with the Greens, because just four months ago, right here in The Tyee, Tieleman was calling for the NDP and Greens to work together.
Interestingly, Tieleman spent much of early 2017 highlighting governance problems under the B.C. Liberals that would likely have been avoided if British Columbia used proportional representation. In January they complained about “wild west” fundraising rules, then scoffed at partisan ad spending in February, lamented the housing affordability crisis in March, suggested former premier Christy Clark suffered from an “empathy deficit” in April, and bemoaned a lack of hospital beds again in April. Ironically, all of these issues that Tieleman reviewed over several months could exist due to one party garnering unilateral power from the first-past-the-post voting system and drifting toward ideological rule. The solution to prevent the problems they catalogued would be to adopt a voting system that requires collaboration between parties: one that results in proportional representation.
Now that I've unwrapped several of Tieleman's dubious arguments against proportional representation, I will adopt one of their trademark political tactics: tarring the enemy, particularly playing the “confusing” card. We rarely hear about the numerous flaws of first-past-the-post voting. Let's look at why it's the most confusing voting system of all.
First, can Tieleman explain why so many British Columbians felt pressured to vote strategically this past May, thanks to the first-past-the-post voting system? Why were so many voters warned that if they opted for their favourite choice, the election outcome would be a terrible result in which their least-favourite option would gain power and cause ruin to the province? I can't think of any greater flaw in a voting system than one that bullies people into how they direct their vote. Social media was an absolute torrent of lecturing, belittling and scolding during the recent B.C. election, due to the scandalous misdemeanor of people intending to vote for their favourite candidate or party. This aspect of first-past-the-post is particularly confusing. Perhaps Tieleman could explain why we should retain such an inherently flawed voting system?
Skewed election results are another perplexing aspect of first-past-the-post voting. Why does the system cause such a massive difference between seats won and the popular vote? Why does first-past-the-post sometimes cause “wrong-winner” election results, in which the party that finishes second in votes forms a majority government, such as British Columbia in 1996, Quebec in 1998, and New Brunswick in 2006?
Why do parties that garner similar levels of support receive such drastically different seat numbers under first-past-the-post? How can a federal party that earned less than 10 per cent of the vote win 49 seats, yet another party that earned almost as many votes (nearly seven per event) receive just one seat during the same election? These are yet more head-scratching questions caused by first-past-the-post voting, resulting in a National Post headline in 2011: “What the #!%*?: Why seat counts never match the popular vote.”
Why does first-past-the-post reward political parties that only have support in one region, yet punish parties with a similar level of support cast over a larger area? How did our 13th-century voting system make regionalist parties such as Bloc Quebecois and Reform into Canada's Official Opposition? And why did first-past-the-post grossly exaggerate the urban-rural divide here in B.C. earlier this year, with the popular vote not nearly as polarized as the seat distribution? What would Tieleman think about the creation of a “North and Interior B.C. Party,” which would likely flourish under first-past-the-post's idiosyncrasies but flop under proportional representation?
Once Tieleman has caught their breath after clearing up such confusion, perhaps they could address why some seats are “safe” while others are “marginal” under first-past-the-post. The B.C. NDP focused much of its recent election campaign soliciting votes strictly from suburban Metro Vancouver, largely ignoring the province's Interior and North. Are voters in Surrey and Port Moody more important than those from Prince George and Fort St. John? Or is this merely a flaw of the first-past-the-post voting system, in which the seats that are mostly likely to swing back and forth between elections receive most of the visits from politicians and the lucrative promises? It's ever so baffling.

Could Tieleman explain why some votes are wasted under first-past-the-post? Any votes in a riding that don't go to the winning candidate, or go to the winning candidate above the threshold needed to win, are essentially meaningless and have no impact on the election. Shouldn't all votes count?
I'm also confused why first-past-the-post creates an insatiable gravity between political parties that pressures them to merge whenever more than two exist. In Alberta, the Progressive Conservatives and Wildrose Party had huge differences of opinion regarding policy, yet merged because the voting system was keeping them out of power. Why not just change the flawed voting system rather than decrease the diversity of voices in our provincial legislatures, Mr. Tieleman? It's mystifying.
Ultimately, first-past-the-post is a relic from eight centuries ago that only works as originally intended under a two-party system. But when was the last time just two parties contested an election either in B.C. or federally? Our voting system is still geared toward pre-Second World War Canada. It's time for the way we choose our elected representatives to be modernized.
B.C.'s provincial legislature has been diminished to mere pantomime theatre under first-past-the-post's falsemajority governments, in which one party wins every single legislative vote and the opposition can be dismissed, ignored, or even ridiculed. That's not how democracy should function.
Proportional representation would decrease the toxicity of British Columbian politics, forcing our elected representatives to work together across party lines. A proportional government would result in pragmatic and evidence-based legislation as well as long-term coherence, rather than wild ideological lurches. It would permanently end strategic voting, ensure that every vote counts, and force political parties to pay full respect to every riding and region of the province. Parties would earn a fair share of seats that reflects their popular vote — no more, no less. And most importantly, every British Columbian would know that their vote informs the make-up of their government.
I'm confused why we haven't adopted proportional representation already.

JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan troops will attack the main stronghold of rebel forces loyal to former vice president Riek Machar if the government's offer of a ceasefire is rejected, a senior minister said on Saturday.
More than 1,000 people have been killed in two weeks of ethnic clashes that threaten to turn into a full-blown civil war in the world's youngest country. Refugees sheltering in U.N. camps spoke of atrocities committed by both main ethnic groups.
President Salva Kiir's government offered an olive branch to the rebels on Friday, proposing a ceasefire and saying it would release eight of 11 senior politicians, widely seen to be Machar allies, arrested over an alleged coup plot against Kiir.
But Kiir's former deputy Machar reacted coolly to the truce offer, telling the BBC that any ceasefire needed to be credible and properly enforced for them to take it seriously.
“Until mechanisms for monitoring are established, when one says there is a unilateral ceasefire, there is no way the other person would be confident this is a commitment,” Machar said.
Information Minister Michael Makuei said government troops on Saturday morning pushed rebels out of the town of Mayom in Unity State and were ready to advance the 90 km (55 miles) to Bentiu, the last state capital held by Machar's forces.
“We will flush (Machar) out of Bentiu if they don't accept the cessation of hostilities,” Makuei told Reuters by phone from the capital Juba.
Fighting between rival groups of soldiers erupted in Juba on December 15, then triggered clashes in half of South Sudan's 10 states - often along ethnic lines, between Machar's group, the Nuer, and Kiir's Dinka.
“FORCED TO EAT CORPSE”
Inside sprawling United Nations camps acting as a safe haven for more than 63,000 civilians, many traumatized Dinka and Nuer say ethnic bloodletting has left them paralyzed with fear.
“They came with their guns and spoke to us in the Dinka language,” said Gattuor Gatkek, a Nuer man seeking refuge at the U.N. camp in Juba's Tonping area where other civilians also have told Reuters about summary executions, rapes and mutilations.

“I didn't speak the language, so they pulled me aside and forced me to eat the flesh of a corpse that lay next to me.”
Dinkas say they have also been victims of ethnic-based atrocities. In Jonglei state capital Bor they talk of mass killings by marauding Nuer militias, while a U.N. human rights group said earlier this week it had found a mass grave believed to contain bodies of Dinka soldiers in rebel-held Bentiu.
The United States, other Western powers and regional governments, fearful of a civil war in a fragile region with notoriously porous borders, have tried to mediate.
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni is due to arrive in Juba on Sunday for talks with Kiir, a South Sudanese official said.
Alex Rondos, the European Union's Special Representative to the Horn of Africa, said South Sudan's leaders must “rise to their responsibilities” and meet for talks without conditions.
“Here is a young country that is only two years independent and the blood is flowing,” Rondos told Reuters in Nairobi.
“Both sides need to stop fiddling around. There is the danger of allowing the situation to remain protracted over petty political haggling at a time when the country is aflame, when passions have been aroused so lethally, which is nothing more than an act of utter irresponsibility in my view.”
South Sudan, a nation the size of France, has the third-largest oil reserves in sub-Saharan Africa after Angola and Nigeria, according to BP, but remains one of the poorest countries on the continent.
PRAYING FOR PEACE
At one point rebels loyal to Machar, who was sacked from their job by Kiir in July, controlled Jonglei state capital Bor and occupied half of Malakal, the capital of the major oil producing Upper Nile state. They were pushed out of both towns this week.
Makuei said the ceasefire offer remained in place and that the government had done all it could to bring about peace talks to end the 14-day-old conflict, adding Machar had done nothing.

Inside the U.N. camps, South Sudan's mainly Christian population was praying for a swift end to the fighting.
“I want all this to end peacefully. We have no other choice,” said Biliu, a 45-year-old man who said they wanted Kiir to urgently reconcile the country's two largest ethnic groups.
Interesting Mantis shrimp Facts:
Mantis shrimps are usually 2 to 7 inches long. Larger species grow 12 inches in length.
Mantis shrimps are brightly colored. Shell of most species is covered with different hues of blue, green, red and orange colors. Forearms are often covered with spots.
Eyes of mantis shrimp are located on the long stalks that can move independently. They have exceptional eyesight that is used both for the detection of the prey and predators.
Mantis shrimps have the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom that can see ultraviolet and polarized light. They have trinocular vision which means that they can see one objects using one of the three different parts of eye.
All mantis shrimps can be divided on spearers and smashes, based on the morphology of appendages and tactic they used to kill the prey.
Spearers have spiny appendages that are used to stab soft-bodied prey such as different types of worms and fish.
Smashers have club-like appendages that easily smash shell of snails, oysters, crustaceans and mollusks.
Attack of mantis shrimps happens extremely quickly - 50 times faster than the blink of an eye. With velocity of 10 meters per second, their punch has the power of a .22 caliber bullet.
Smashers are famous for their incredible strong punches that can break the glass of aquarium.
Most species of mantis shrimps are solitary and territorial creatures. They fiercely defend their home against intruders.
Mantis shrimps are able to recognize their neighbors by the smell and by the morphological characteristics.
Some species of mantis shrimp are monogamous and spend up to 20 years together. During the mating rituals, mantis shrimps often fluoresce.
Females can lay eggs in the burrows or keep them in their forelimbs until they hatch. Some species exhibit parental care. Female lays two sets of eggs, one for them and the other for the father to take care of the eggs until they hatch.
Larvae of mantis shrimps swim as a part of zooplankton up to 3 months. They show aggressive behavior even during the larval stage.
Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.
Ahmad Salek, chairperson of Iran's parliamentary cultural commission, on Tuesday accused their country's Baha'i community of spying for Israel and the United States.
“I declare very explicitly that Baha'ism is an espionage organization which gathers intelligence for the CIA and Mossad, and there are abundant documents to prove this,” the Fars news agency quoted Salek saying.
Fars, which is affiliated with the Revolutionary Guard, reported in the same article comments Iran's then-prosecutor-general Qorban-Ali Dorri-Najafabadi made in 2009: “We [as the state] offer a variety of services to the Baha'i sect in Iran and respect them as human beings, but not as insiders, spies, or a political grouplet supported by Britain and Israel to cause disturbance in Iran.”The Baha'i community faces intense persecution from the regime. Last October, Dr. Ahmed Shaheed, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran, issued a report that included a section on the persecution.He wrote, ”The special rapporteur continues to observe what appears to be an escalating pattern of systematic human rights violations targeting members of the Baha'i community, who face arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment, national security charges for active involvement in religious affairs, restrictions on religious practice, denial of higher education, obstacles to state employment and abuses within schools.”Last August, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an edict – or fatwa – calling on all Iranians to ostracize the Baha'is.After Khamenei issued the fatwa, Ataollah Rezvani, a popular Baha'i leader, was murdered. It is unclear who killed Rezvani.Salek's comments triggered reactions in cyberspace. The Financial Times Middle East and North Africa correspondent tweeted on Tuesday, “Outrageous: #Iran lawmaker claims entire Baha'i faith is an espionage outfit for the CIA & Mossad.“ Earlier this month, the Baha'i World New Service reported a stabbing attack on a Baha'i family in Birjand in eastern Iran. According to the report, the three victims – husband, wife and daughter – survived the attack.“The attacker – who was masked – entered the home of Ghodratollah Moodi and their wife, Touba Sabzehjou,” the news service wrote.Diane Ala'i, the Baha'i International Community's representative to the United Nations in Geneva, said, “There can be no doubt that this crime was religiously motivated. Mr. Moodi was well-known as a leader in the Baha'i community in Birjand.“Our immediate concern is for the recovery of the Moodi family. But we are also concerned that authorities in Iran begin immediately to investigate this crime and bring the perpetrator to justice.“The sad fact is that there have been more than 50 physical assaults on Iranian Baha'is since 2005 – and none of the attackers has been prosecuted or otherwise brought to justice. And at least nine Baha'is had been murdered under suspicious circumstances in the same period,” Ala'i said.

Many people seem to not have clear who Bertolt Hoover is, what they are fighting for and, above all, why they behave like they do. They're stuck in their own opinion of the character, which is often too good or too bad, without any half measure.
Well, I hope this post will be able to open these people's mind, making them see Attack on Titan's story from the top, without only focusing on their favourite characters, Bertolt included. Yes: I also want Bertolt's fans to reconsider their own idea of the character, which is what I did after chapter 84 was out. I'm not saying you have to hate them or what, the opposite: what I'm aiming for is to give you a closer view of this guy, paying more attention to details, and eventually, possibly deal with the way they died.
Before I start, I want you all to have this clear: in this story there isn't any good or bad side. All the characters are victims of a cruel world and fight for what they think is right. It has been said and shown so many times, so if you are not able to understand this, I invite you to not read forward. It would be just a waste of time, for me and for you.
For the rest of the people, you're welcome to read what follows and let me know you opinion about it. This means you don't have to necessarily agree with my words: I just want to give you a closer, possibly different view of this character to better understand it.
I will start form the event that made me wanted to write this post: Bertolt's death.
After a first reading, I was completely shocked about the poor focus Bertolt had during their last moments. They were all worried about the serum thing, wondering who was worth to revive between Armin and Erwin, and Bertolt seemed just like a tool in this, an object and no longer a person, not a human.
Well, I guess this is what Isayama want us to believe at this point of the story. The proof is in the reaction Bertolt has when they figure out they are about to die.
At first, I was greatly disappointed by their behaviour. They cry out for help, asking to be saved when only few chapters ago they felt like they were prepared to any outcome, like they were at peace with themselves and ready to leave the scene. Their reaction was the thing I hated the most from chapter 84. Because while I was always prepared to see them die, the only thing I asked was at least for them to have some meaningful, possibly glorious ending. I always told myself “he is the Colossal Titan after all, the God of the story” like Isayama themselves said “He can't just die like Titan food, begging to their old friends like they did in The Clash of Titans arc…”
My wish for a memorable and dignitous ending increased after chapter 78. Here is where Bertolt meets a great, outstanding development: they go from being an unwilled, weak character to someone who is so tired of their hard role that is now able to accept any outcome, death included.
 They are showing us a new resolution, something that both characters and fans didn't expect from him. And this makes them look cool, this makes them worth to be the Colossal Titan, the icon of evil, for the very first time in nearly eighty chapters.
When we meet their new strength, we their fans are a bit surprised but also proud of him. Because, let's be honest: seeing our favourite character showing guts when everyone always underestimated it gives us a sense of justice and makes us feel braver as well. It also carries a beautiful message: it says that everyone, even the less confident creature (which could be us) can take courage and change in a strong one, taking back their lost dignity.
This is why, as we see all of this falling apart, we start feeling so angry and sad.
When Bertolt fails, we fail together with him. Because we created a bound with this character. We felt sad, uneasy and then stronger with him. We cried with them and with them we aimed to come back home, no matter what. We were so proud of our boy, and finally happy to see them so self-aware. This was what made their dead-fate acceptable. We came to terms with their high chance of dying because we knew they were ready, and seeing them so scared in chapter 84 comes in like a thunderbolt.
Now: I decided to write this post mostly because I have seen many Bertolt's fans having my same, first reaction, being angry and all. After the chapter was out, I was so disappointed that I felt a sense of rejection towards this character, as well as for the plot itself. Knowing how bad and disappointed I felt, I couldn't do anything but avoid what made me think about him. It's a self-defense mechanism that everyone adopts in fictional things as well as in real life. It is a human behaviour, something we can't blame us because trying to be happy is a everyday challenge we want to win.
So, how did I win my challenge against Bertolt's unglorious death?
I started wondering why this character is so important to me, why I felt so attached to it and, above all, if I did, really get it right. I went back in the manga to take all the moments I like the most, and found out something I never had that clear: this character was made up to be the Colossal Titan since before the manga even started. It seems obvious, but it's not. Isayama gave this character far more attention that we may imagine. Their presence on the scene was carefully managed to be none in the first thirty chapters, more evident in the following twenty and a mix of the two in the latest fourty. All to confuse the readers. Readers that ignore how much a silence presence can tell. In the first fifty chapters we are not, really allowed to know what's up in their mind. We never have access to their thoughts and the only hint of what their feelings are is in their face.
That's right: Bertolt's face was not randomly drawn. Isayama had a clear idea of what the Colossal Titan's human form looked like, even before the story started. These are two images from the original Attack on Titan's draft, the very first version of the story never been published:
They already have the miserable look we all know.  They are desperate, and we won't be able to know why for a long time. As the story goes on, despite the author improving style, their face hardly gets big changes, especially the eyes:
Their eyes are what speaks for him. They communicate their feelings better and in a more sincere way then their own mouth, carefully kept shut mostly because of their true identity. If we pay attention to these eyes, we would be able to see and understand everything this character is hiding.
Let's take chapter 78 again, and try reading it paying more attention to their face. When they confront Armin, their old comrade and friend, they put great effort in making their words credible by wearing a cold, threatening mask.
If we carefully look at their face, we would notice the great effort they put in making their eyes look determined. They change from their usual, good look to something that only pretends to be evil. They don't want to kill their friends: they have to, as they clearly say just few panels forward:
This is the behaviour of someone that has some hidden, but good reason to act like this. They don't really believe their own words, and this is pretty much evident in two panels, the ones in which they are shouting that they will kill everyone:
In these two panels their eyes are not visible: Isayama is hiding them because what they are saying is so unbelievable to them themselves that they are not even able to look at their enemy, neither at us readers.
So, I don't want to kill your convinctions, but the resolution displayed in this chapter is not a real change. What Bertolt is doing is simply, fully taking the responsibility of their role for the very first time in their life.  They are so tired and so eager to put an end to everyone's suffering that they are forcing themselves to be something they were never ready to become.
What triggered this sudden decision were probably Reiner's words in chapter 77:
He, who is the only person Bertolt really has, claims nothing but the raw truth: Bertolt was never a reliable person, not when it came to their mission. They always stood apart simply because they were never, really able to accept their role. This is so true that even Bertolt themselves admits it, putting on the most bitter and genuine smile:
 They are just too good to really take their responsibility as the Colossal Titan, and this is why their death was not epic as we would like it to be.
The Colossal Titan is Bertolt. But Bertolt was never the Colossal Titan. They only managed to reach its goddish nature in chapter 82, which is what I consider the best written and drawn chapter of the entire series, as well as the most important chapter for this guy's development. Here, not only Bertolt is talking like a god, they also resemble the divine, someone so sure about their power and strength that is not even able to see Armin's smart plan.
I already mentioned that Isayama drawn the Colossal Titan thinking about it as the God of the series. They say that it symbolizes the ruler on humanity, the individual who decides who lives and who dies. But the Colossal Titan is also something else: it is what Bertolt was never ready to become, the monster we never really see in their human eyes. On one side this is kinda disappointing, because one of the features we like the most about Bertolt is the fact that they are actually the mascotte of the series, which makes them a cool character, someone to respect despite them being an insecure, timid guy like many real people.
But this is the other side we really like: their nature as a human. We are able to feel an empathy with them because they are a victim of their own fate. No matter what they did: they are good, and we know this very well. If they really are evil, we probably wouldn't love them as we do. We like them because of their tragic position, an unavoidable condition that makes them interesting and deep in a subtle way that other characters don't have.
And all of this comes first than them simply being the cool and scary Colossal Titan.
So, what's wrong with the way they die? Was the glorious ending we all imagined really appropriate for this character? Was really in their character to leave the scene as a fearless hero?
Sure the way they die is rough, and cruel, and way too fast. And we hate it because we know they did't, really deserve such a pain. But we don't have to forget what is Bertolt's role in the story: since they were revealed as the Colossal Titan, we started wondering about whom the enemy really is, if it really is the Titans or, more interestingly, the humans inside the walls. This is something we shouldn't leave apart, because this is what will bring back Bertolt's character in the future, finally giving to their death the meaning it deserves. We just have to wait for the right moment, which wasn't in chapter 84.
So, for Bertolt's fans: don't be sad for this character, because they died as the character we learnt to love, and we should be happy about this. They didn't die like the Colossal Titan, like the monster they never wanted to be. They died like Bertolt, like the human we constantly see in their eyes.
They died scared, because Bertolt was scared of dying. They had their moment of glory, but when facing death they left the scene without losing their humanity, proving that we were always believing in something true: they have always been a good guy until the very end.
This is why you shouldn't stop loving them as you did until now. You have to cope with the fact that they are indeed an unlucky character: this is their only “fault”. Rejecting them because of this would be like rejecting a son or a doughter because they've born with some sort of desease. And I know that people like you (and like me) would never do such a thing.
Bertolt Hoover is not a character for all. Understanding them is hard, and only few people are able to feel such a close empathy with him. You should be proud of this.

I didn't spend a word about the Armin eating Bertolt thing, because I don't think it was the real problem behind the disappointment we all felt for Bertolt. Armin becoming a Titan is more damage for the plot itself then for Bertolt's fate. Chapters 83 and 84 were definitely the worst chapters in the story of this manga, but I have at least found a way to not hating my favourite character, and that's enough.

This post should've been a Vlog, but my shitty computer left me while I was making the montage. I didn't want to wait longer to share these thoughts with you, because I felt like you needed now.
Creative Commons/Roy Luck An abandoned open pit iron ore mine near Virginia, Minnesota.
Republicans aren't being shy about trying to poach typically Democratic votes on the Iron Range for their slate of candidates this fall, capitalizing on a rift between pro-mining Democrats in northeastern Minnesota and environmentalists over a proposed copper and nickel mining project.
Former Republican House speaker and gubernatorial candidate Kurt Zellers has been pushing the slogan “We're all Iron Rangers.” Endorsed Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mike McFadden recently tweeted “Let's get this done!” — referring to the PolyMet Mining Corp. project near Hoyt Lakes, which would create more than 350 jobs on the Iron Range. And GOP-endorsed gubernatorial candidate Jeff Johnson says he's ardently in favor of using the state's natural resources to create jobs.
Most agree — all of these are more effective campaign slogans in the state's economically struggling to mine towns than incumbent DFL Gov. Mark Dayton's “let's wait and see” approach, or even Democratic U.S. Sen. Al Franken's calls to complete an environmental impact statement (EIS) but still move ahead with the project. They are responding at least somewhat to opposition to the project from environmentalists, who fear the untested non-ferrous mining project could damage the area's pristine lakes for hundreds of years to come.
But the Republican messaging has DFL political operatives worried that mining support will push the longtime labor voters in northeastern Minnesota into the GOP column. In a midterm election with DFL turnout outlook already low, many operatives say Iron Range votes — while dwindling — could be critical in the race for the Eighth District, the governor's office and possibly even a handful of state House seats.
Long term, Democrats are looking for a way preserve Iron Rangers as a continuing part of the state party. Leaders recently indefinitely spiked a debate over including mining support in the party's platform, but it's an issue that can only be pushed off for so long.

“The thing that's more dangerous with mining isn't the votes that are in play but the fact that it creates a sense of discord and chaos and that makes people uneasy,” DFL Iron Range blogger and longtime political activist Aaron Brown said. “There's a general frustration and malaise over the fact that for 40 years we've watched decline — not growth — on the Range. There's frustration with that, and some believe mining new minerals will solve that, others no.”
Every vote counts
When it comes to Dayton and Franken, both of whom are up for reelection this fall, it's easy for political operatives to point to their last narrow margins of victory in the 2008 and 2010 elections. Franken famously won their race six years ago after a protracted recount by only 312 votes. Dayton won their first race for governor in 2010 after a much shorter recount and with a margin of nearly 9,000 votes.
This fall is shaping up to have similar dynamics to 2010, a midterm election that saw DFL voter participation drop considerably. That year also saw a surge in GOP participation in response to the passage of the federal health-care overhaul, which knocked the late 36-year DFL incumbent U.S. Rep. Jim Oberstar out of the Eighth District in favor of political newcomer and Republican Chip Cravaack.
That upset rocked perceptions of Democratic support in the Iron Range, but Dayton did well in the area that year, touting their support for mining jobs and pulling in votes many considered critical in the close race. They could lose some of those votes this year, some say.
“[Mining] might hurt [Dayton] a little this election, there's no doubt about it. Both they and senator weren't the biggest winners in their last elections, and everyone knows that,” former Iron Range state Rep. Tom Rukavina said. But overall, Rukavina thinks most Range Democrats won't be so quick to abandon the DFL Party for another party that has historically butted heads with the region.
“Tim Pawlenty took $50 million from our mineral fund for the budget, which would have solved some of this, and three years ago Republicans tried to take $60 million in local taconite taxes,” they added. “I think the Republicans have been no friend to the Iron Range.”
That same fortune may not fall on DFL State Auditor Rebecca Otto, who made a statement about mining last October when they voted against 31 nonferrous mineral leases over potential cost overruns to taxpayers on the PolyMet project. Afterward they sent out a fundraising email blast noting that they were the lone no vote on the state's Executive Council against the leases. That riled DFLers on the Iron Range, where “Dump Otto” signs quickly started popping up in yards.
While Otto doesn't claim to be pro- or anti-mining, she's facing an intra-party primary challenge from former House Minority Leader Matt Entenza, who has made their support of the PolyMet project one of the key differences between the two in the campaign. Republican-endorsed auditor candidate Randy Gilbert is also pushing their support for mining.
“I don't think Rebecca Otto is going to come up here and do very well,” Rukavina noted.
Iron Range candidates in trouble?
But just how many votes do statewide candidates stand to lose in the Iron Range mining towns? Mining has been on the decline in Minnesota since the 1960s, making the voice of the miners less of an economic and political force. The district has shed tens of thousands of residents since the 1980s, and those who do move in don't necessarily thinks of mining as their top issue.
“We are talking about single-digit thousands, a few thousand people in the cities and townships of the predominantly eastern Iron Range, that are motivated by mining and would consider breaking the DFL in certain races,” Brown said. “All Dayton or Franken or Otto would have to do would make up those votes in the suburbs or in the metro.”
Eighth District DFL Chairman Don Bye, who has served in that role since the 1970s, said they think the issue touches the district more broadly than just the people living in mining towns. “Every job in the mine or mining area was the focal point of about eight jobs throughout the area,” they said.
Eighth District Republican Treasurer Ron Britton said even DFL legislative candidates could see their usually solid margins slim this year. “The local Democratic legislators are taking a hit from the metro-area environmentalists who have proposed stopping the mining up there. That's our basic industry,” Britton said. “This means there's a lot more sentiment for the Republican Party than probably in the last election.”
Brown worries the mining could that could hurt more insulated Iron Range candidates like Eighth District U.S. Rep. Rick Nolan. While Nolan strongly supports the PolyMet project, GOP challenger Stewart Mills is criticizing them for supporting Otto's campaign for reelection.
“Rebecca Otto is the most anti-mining statewide elected official but Rick Nolan fell right in behind her, putting party over the good of the Iron Range,” Mills said. “The bottom line is you can't say you support mining and support Rebecca Otto.”
But University of Minnesota Duluth political science professor and former DFL lobbyist Wy Spano says they doubt Mills' argument on Otto alone will be enough to tie Nolan to anti-mining sentiment. “It's really kind of just hard for me to believe that it's an issue you could make stick,” Spano said. “He endorsed somebody — that's too inside baseball for most voters.”
Nolan's campaign manager, Kendal Killian, dismissed the criticism from Mills, saying the Fleet Farm executive can't connect or relate with “middle class folks in mining communities or anywhere else.” “He's never even had to apply for a job,” Killian said. “His campaign is struggling to gain support on the Iron Range and this desperate attack won't change that
Preserving support
In the long run, some Democrats are less worried about the election cycle and more about how to preserve the longtime participation of Iron Rangers in the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.
Nancy Larson, a former DFL lobbyist and a longtime activist who grew up on the Iron Range, is concerned over a call from environmentalists to push a broad EIS that would not only impact the PolyMet project, but could potentially endanger mining projects already underway. That could tip support on the Iron Range with Republicans for many years to come.
“They are pushing so hard,” they said. “If they are successful at that, that will really undermine [the mining] side. There's always going to be conflict on the Range, which is not unusual. Certainly it doesn't have the clout it used to have, but that's an area of the state that's important to [Democrats] and we care about and we want to keep it strong.”
One thing is certain: the political jockeying from Republicans has left Iron Rangers with a feeling of dejectedness from both political parties over the last several election cycles.
“These are bar-stool independents,” Brown said. “These are frustrated folks who aren't getting what they want from the Democrats, but they haven't forgotten what was taken from them when Republicans had power.”
Hi all,
There was a recent kernel update that caused issues with jsvc, which in turn prevented the UniFi or UniFi Video controllers from running. The issue was present on our two official distros, and likely others. Updated kernels have been released for Debian 7/8/9 and Ubuntu 16.04. We primarily list recent LTS releases, but other versions would've been affected too.
There are quite a few docs on that CVE, if you'd like to read them. Here are a couple:
Stack Clash CVE: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000364
Stack Clash vulnerability description: https://www.qualys.com/2017/06/19/stack-clash/stack-clash.txt
There original thread on the issue, and it starts HERE. The issue is actually when trying to run jsvc, and there is at least a Debian bug report on it HERE. Debian made an announcement HERE to report that fixed kernels had been released.
The known affected kernel versions are:
Debian 7: 3.2.89-1 Debian 8: 3.16.43-2+deb8u1 Debian 9: 4.9.30-2+deb9u1 Ubuntu 16.04: 4.4.0-81
The known fixed kernel versions are:
Debian 7: 3.2.89-2 Debian 8: 3.16.43-2+deb8u2 Debian 9: 4.9.30-2+deb9u2 Ubuntu 16.04: 4.4.0-83
It'll be pretty obvious if the controllers don't start, then you're likely affected, at least if you haven't employed the fix below. If you're affected you can check the kernel version. There are several ways to do this, one easy one is by issuing the following via shell/Terminal:
uname -a
The workaround for affected kernels
UniFi:
echo "JSVC_EXTRA_OPTS=\"\$JSVC_EXTRA_OPTS -Xss1280k\"" | sudo tee -a /etc/default/unifi
UniFi Video:
echo "JSVC_EXTRA_OPTS=\"\$JSVC_EXTRA_OPTS -Xss1280k\"" | sudo tee -a /etc/default/unifi-video
The UniFi Cloud Key and the UniFi Video NVR Appliance (formerly airVision NVR Appliance) are not affected. These devices run a custom kernel, so they would not be updated via the mainline upgrade.
How to revert once on a fixed kernel
Once you're on an updated kernel, that is known to be good, it is ideal to revert the above fix. The following command(s) can be run via shell, and it will delete that line from the default file. The alternative is to delete (rm) the file, but you'd want to make sure that you didn't have anything else in that file.
UniFi:
sudo sed -i "/JSVC_EXTRA_OPTS=\"\$JSVC_EXTRA_OPTS -Xss1280k\"/d" /etc/default/unifi
UniFi Video:
sudo sed -i "/JSVC_EXTRA_OPTS=\"\$JSVC_EXTRA_OPTS -Xss1280k\"/d" /etc/default/unifi-video
Many thanks to the users who starting posting about this, and bringing it to our attention. Much of the above info is from the thread (see HERE), and kudos should go to the users there (too many usernames to @ mention everyone, sorry).
Cheers,
The UniFi Team
Sometimes, the creepiest things about Facebook are also the most compelling.
Take Facebook Friendship Pages, for example. The feature, which is rolling out to all users, allows you to look at every interaction between two people. You can see how early flirting led to a marriage (or a breakup), look back at old photos with a longtime pal, or find out when was the last time two friends hung out.
To be clear, Facebook isn't making more data publicly available with Friendship Pages. To look at the history of any two people, you must be friends with one and have access to the other's full profile. This isn't a privacy issue in the traditional sense, because Friendship Pages is merely compiling information in a new way.
What Friendship Pages amounts to is an evolved version of "Facebook Stalking," the time-honored tradition of soaking up more knowledge about a person through Facebook than you might've learned in real life. Meet someone at a party through a mutual friend? Now you can easily see their history through photos and wall posts.
Is that creepy? Absolutely, but here's the thing: "Facebook Stalking" wouldn't be a common phrase if people didn't love doing it. Before Farmville, status updates and the "Like" button, poring through someone's profile was a major Facebook pastime. Think of Friendship Pages as a return to form.
If you don't like it, the standard Facebook disclaimer applies: Don't put anything on the site that you wouldn't be comfortable sharing with everyone, and take control of your privacy settings, or just don't use the site at all. Personally, I'm looking forward to digging up some dirt on my good friends.
Alicia Vikander and Dane DeHaan star in a messy, strange adaptation of the best-selling novel.
The behind-the-scenes release date drama surrounding Justin Chadwick's long-delayed and oft-moved “Tulip Fever” has managed to keep the beleaguered Weinstein Company release in the cultural zeitgeist for at least a year longer than it should have. It ping-ponged from a July 2016 release to a February 2017 release, which then moved to August, and then September.
It was not worth the wait. And, judging by the chopped-up feel of the final product (and word from audiences that saw earlier cuts), those well-publicized calendar moves only resulted in a film that's been repeatedly edited into a bizarre, boring final product that packs as much punch as a light sneeze or a gentle cough. A fever it is not.
Based on Deborah Moggach's best-selling novel of the same name (and scripted by the author with Tom Stoppard), “Tulip Fever” is set in 17th century Holland, during the height of the eponymous madness that set Amsterdam alight with outsized demands for the newly introduced flower. What blossomed was a speculative bubble of insane proportions, with prized bulbs fetching ludicrously high prices in a marketplace conducted in backrooms, bars, and brothels. People went crazy for the flowers, risking fortunes on single bulbs that may or may not bloom, and may or may not look good while doing it. That madness lords over the film and its characters, an environment that has gone topsy-turvy for pretty flowers and all the ephemeral charm they represent.
Strangely narrated by housemaid Maria (played by Holliday Grainger), the film follows the stilted marriage of wealthy peppercorn king Cornelius Sandvoort (Christoph Waltz) and the charming Sophia (Alicia Vikander), an orphan who has gone from childhood convent to overseeing the couple's domestic life. Initially played as a horny old fool who is desperate to make a baby with their young wife (a bedtime routine sequence illuminates the Sandvoorts' clockwork lovemaking, along with Sophia's profound boredom), Cornelius eventually becomes one of the film's few sympathetic characters, a victim of both circumstance and unfathomable cruelty. Cornelius' obsession with making an heir directs itself into another plan, one also centered on crafting something lasting: a pricey portrait of the man and their wife, painted by a young artist (Dane DeHaan) with nothing to their name.
The introduction of painter Jan Van Loos into the equation leads to the unfurling of a passionate, if baffling, romance between the poor artist and the rich wife. Vikander and DeHaan lack more than chemistry; they lack actual screen time, as the duo share the barest minimum of interaction (all overseen by Cornelius, incidentally), before deciding they're in love. Played out in oddly schticky affectation, the pair realize their affection for each other at the exact same minute, leading to a dizzying run through the streets that wouldn't be out of place in the most shameless romantic comedies. Undeterred by the mismatched pair, Chadwick tries to gloss over their absence of passion with a series of thrust-heavy sex scenes that lasciviously play up Vikander's naked form, while DeHaan's Jan stares dimly onward.
And that's not all, as the overstuffed film also finds room to include yet another romance, this one involving Maria (if you wondered why she's the narrator, well, this still doesn't quite explain it) and local fishmonger William (Jack O'Connell). Their love affair is overshadowed by the tulip market, as William risks it all in hopes of giving the pair a better life, a sweet sentiment that's soon ruined by a profound (and deeply stupid) misunderstanding. The pair exhibit a believable chemistry, one that only further highlights how force-fed the bond between Vikander and DeHaan is, no matter how much gusto they both put into it (DeHaan, to be sure, is excellent at fake-painting things and Vikander continues to be well-suited for lush historical offerings).
While the characters of “Tulip Fever” exist in a world ruled by passionate insanity, much of the film hinges on out-there coincidences and convoluted plot points that are big asks even in a world driven crazy by flowers. The various plotlines intersect late in the film (punctuated by distracting turns from Cara Delevingne and Zach Galifianakis, just for good measure). Essential pieces of narrative rely on ludicrous mishaps involving items as diverse as really long cloaks, fat bags of coins, and in one case, a priceless tulip bulb that is chopped up and eaten by a drunk. Reason may not rule in a tulip-mad Amsterdam, but that doesn't mean tossing away actual logic like so many rotten stems.
As the film limps toward its final act, its tone vacillates between sweeping romantic drama and slapstick comedy. Sophia and Jan cook up an idea that ensnares both the well-meaning Cornelius and a desperate Maria, using their individual traumas to launch a plan that is startlingly vicious (and occasionally played for wacky laughs). Love makes people do crazy things, and as overwrought and silly as “Tulip Fever” is in both execution and aim, the film embodies that sentiment in an unexpectedly compelling manner. It's unfortunate that it takes 107 minutes to get there, but a final twist offers the film's sole play for emotional resonance.
In other words, the fever breaks.
Grade: D+
“Tulip Fever” opens in wide release Friday, September 1.

Abstract
Part I of this review addressed the possible modulatory role of exercise on neuronal growth factors to promote brain health in neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), which is characterized by varied patterns of inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. Part II presents evidence that supports the potential neuroprotective effect of exercise on the modulation of immune factors and stress hormones in MS. Many current therapies used to attenuate MS progression are mediated, at least in part, through alterations in the relative concentrations of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Exercise-induced alterations in local and systemic cytokine production may also benefit immune function in health and disease. Exercise immunomodulation appears to be mediated by a complex interaction of hormones, cytokines and neural factors that may favorably influence immune variables in MS. The promising interplay between exercise and brain health in MS deserves further investigation.
With the Euro 2016 soccer tournament kicking off this Friday in France, authorities are on high alert. The weeks-long championship, with 51 games across 10 venues, is expected to draw millions of fans to crowded stadiums and “fan zones.” All of which, in light of the attacks on Paris late last year, are being considered potential terrorist targets.
Countries like the U.S. and Britain have issued warnings about the potential terror risk, urging people to stay vigilant. And French security forces have been holding drills and staging mock attacks, preparing to respond to anything from shootings to bombings. The French government has also launched a free mobile app for iPhone and Android to encourage attendees to stay alert and provide critical information and communication in the event of an attack.
Called SAIP, which stands for “system for alert and information for the population” in French, the app will issue alerts in French and English to users about “unexpected events” within 15 minutes of a confirmed incident, according to the Agence France-Presse. Its range will monitor up to eight geographic zones, so users can check on their friends and families abroad for the event. The app will also provide information on how to stay safe in different attack situations.
The idea for SAIP came on the heels of the Paris attacks last November, when terrorists affiliated with the self-proclaimed Islamic State killed more than a hundred people in large public areas around the city. Among the venues targeted that night was France's largest stadium, the Stade de France in the Saint-Denis neighborhood just outside Paris, which will host some of the year's championship games.
France will deploy a record 90,000 security staff—including 42,000 police, 30,000 gendarmes (armed police officers) and 10,000 soldiers—for the games. Despite these efforts from the French government, however, CNN reports that events in recent weeks have caused citizens to lose confidence in the country's ability to secure the venues. At a soccer match in May, for example, fans managed to smuggle fireworks and smoke bombs into the Stade de France, prompting officials to “totally revise” security measures ahead of the upcoming tournament.
In a shocking announcement today from EA Sports, makers of NHL 15, Gary Bettman, commissioner of the NHL will be joining the cover vote in a surprise bonus round.
Fans will be able to vote for Gary Bettman against the winner of the Subban VS Bergeron round.
“It was defiantly a surprise.” Said Andrew Wilson, CEO of EA. “We didn't even plan on doing this until a few hours ago when Mr. Bettman gave us a call and threatened to revoke our license to use NHL teams and players unless we gave them a chance to be on the cover.”
We asked Gary Bettman why they wanted to be on the cover of NHL 15.
“I have done so many things that no other commissioner has done before, I've had three lockouts, been booed countless times by fans… I wanted to add another thing to my resume that I could show to the MLB when I apply to take over Bud Selig's spot next year.”
But don't worry hockey fans, EA Sports assured us that this bonus round of the cover vote would be fair and not rigged in any way, shape or form. Just like all the other rounds.

Ross Jr. has a stake in a shipping firm that receives millions of dollars a year in revenue from a company whose key owners include Russian President Vladimir Putin's son-in-law and a Russian tycoon who was subject to sanctions by the U.S. Treasury Department as a member of Putin's inner circle.
Ross, a billionaire private equity investor, divested most of their business assets before joining President Donald Trump's cabinet in February, but kept a stake in the shipping firm, Navigator Holdings Ltd., which is incorporated in the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific.
Offshore entities in which Ross and other investors hold a financial stake controlled 31.5 per cent of the company in 2016, according to Navigator's latest annual report.
Among Navigator's largest customers, contributing over $68 million US ($87.3 million Cdn) in revenue since 2014, is the Moscow-based gas and petrochemicals company Sibur. Two of its key owners are Kirill Shamalov, who is married to Putin's youngest daughter, and Gennady Timchenko, the oligarch who was subject to U.S. sanctions because their activities in the energy sector, the Treasury Department said, were "directly linked to Putin."
Why would any officer of the U.S. government have any relationship with a Putin crony? - Daniel Fried, Russia expert
Another powerful owner is Sibur's largest shareholder, Leonid Mikhelson, who controls an energy company that was also subject to sanctions by the Treasury Department for propping up Putin's rule.
Ross's connections emerge from an examination of public records and a leak of millions of offshore financial documents from the Bermuda law firm Appleby obtained by German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung. They were shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and its global network of media partners.
They represent the inner workings of Appleby from the 1950s until 2016. The files include documents from Appleby's corporate services division, which became independent in 2016 under the name Estera.
The leaked files showed a chain of companies and partnerships in the Cayman Islands through which Ross has retained their financial stake in Navigator.
As commerce secretary, Ross has a direct authority over trade and manufacturing policy and is an influential voice in the government on virtually any aspect of the U.S. economic relationship with other countries, including Russia. In recent years, tensions between the United States and Russia have escalated, with the U.S. imposing sanctions against Russia after its 2014 invasion of Crimea and interference in the 2016 presidential election.
In the aftermath of the election, investigations by Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice have explored potential business ties between Russia and members of Trump's administration.
History of financing oligarchs
While several of Trump's campaign and business associates have come under scrutiny, until now no business connections have been reported between senior Trump administration officials and members of Putin's family or inner circle.
During their confirmation process, Ross was asked repeatedly about their business ties to Russia, mostly related to their former role as vice-chairperson of the Bank of Cyprus, which has a long history of financing Russian oligarchs.
"The United States Senate and the American public deserve to know the full extent of your connections with Russia and your knowledge of any ties between the Trump Administration, Trump Campaign, or Trump Organization and the Bank of Cyprus," a group of five Democratic senators wrote Ross after the hearing but prior to their confirmation.
Ross was once chairperson of Navigator Holdings Ltd., which connects them to Russian President Vladimir Putin's son-in-law and a Russian tycoon who was subject to sanctions by the U.S. (Navigator Gas)
Ross responded briefly to a question submitted for the hearing, saying the Russians who invested in the bank "were not my partners," but didn't respond to the senators' letter.
They were also asked about their shipping holdings and whether they could pose a conflict of interest with their duties at Commerce. But they faced no questions about Navigator — where they once are chairperson of the board — and its relationship with Sibur.
Sibur is "a company with crony connections," said Daniel Fried, a Russia expert who served in senior State Department posts in both Republican and Democratic administrations. "Why would any officer of the U.S. government have any relationship with a Putin crony?"
(CBC)
Ross joined the board only after Navigator began dealing with Sibur and "never met" Shamalov, Timchenko or Mikhelson, said James Rockas, a spokesperson for the Commerce Department.
"Secretary Ross recuses themselves from any matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels, but has been generally supportive of the administration's sanctions of Russian and Venezuelan entities," Rockas said.
Another of Navigator's major customers is PDVSA, the Venezuelan state oil company owned by the authoritarian regime of Nicolas Maduro. The Trump Administration placed sanctions on one current and one former executive at PDVSA in July 2017, and on the company itself the next month.
Commerce and conflict
The fact that Ross's Cayman Islands companies benefit from a firm controlled by Putin proxies raises serious potential conflicts of interest, experts say.
As commerce secretary, Ross has the power to influence U.S. trade, sanctions and other policies that could affect Sibur's owners. Likewise, Sibur's owners — and through them, Putin themselves — could increase or decrease Sibur's business with Navigator even as Ross helps steer U.S. policy.

Richard Painter, who served as chief ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, said Ross might have to recuse themselves from a range of sanctions decisions. They added that while there was no inherent violation in Ross's holdings, the Navigator arrangement warrants closer scrutiny.
"Apart from those legal issues, I'd be very concerned that someone in the U.S. government was making money from dealing with the Russians, and I'd want to know the facts," Painter said.
Commerce spokesperson Rockas said that Ross "has never had to seek, nor received, any ethics exemption" and abides by the "highest ethical standards." Ethics exemptions are granted to allow officials to participate in issues where there might be a conflict of interest.
20% of profits
Before joining Trump's cabinet, the 79-year-old Ross was a titan in the world of private equity, rounding up investors from around the world to put money into troubled companies in the hope of profitably turning them around.
When all went well, they and their firm made money not only on their investments and management fees, but also from a compensation system that allows the general partners, who manage private equity funds, to earn 20 per cent of any profits that exceed a certain level, according to Ross's pre-appointment financial disclosures.
The disclosure requirements weren't written with Wilbur Ross in mind. - Kathleen Clark, law professor
Many of the private equity funds involved in these investments were created and administered by Appleby. The leaked files offer a window into how Appleby helped their firm, WL Ross & Co, reap the benefits of offshore havens such as the Cayman Islands, a British territory that permits extraordinary levels of financial secrecy and allows paper companies run from New York and elsewhere to operate there tax-free. In 2015, the Cayman Islands was ranked fifth by the Financial Secrecy Index in its worldwide ratings.
The complexity of the offshore structures adds legal and reputational distance and obscures the full extent of Ross's business relationships even as it allows them to profit from them, according to tax and ethics experts consulted by ICIJ.
"The disclosure requirements weren't written with Wilbur Ross in mind," said Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University who is an expert on government ethics, "and I don't think adequately provide the public or a government ethics official with an understanding of the wide variety of financial interests that they have."
Yale, Harvard
The son of a lawyer-turned-judge and a school teacher, Ross was raised in suburban New Jersey, and graduated from Yale and Harvard Business School.
In the late 1970s, they joined the British investment banking firm Rothschild Group, eventually rising to lead the firm's bankruptcy advisory practice. They met Donald Trump in 1990, when the future president's Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City was experiencing financial trouble, and Ross represented a group of bondholders.

Ross engineered a deal that preserved a stake in the company for Trump, reportedly telling disgruntled bondholders that the Trump name was "still very much an asset." It was a welcome assist for the future president.
Over the years, Ross has climbed to the ranks of the wealthiest U.S. individuals, with a fortune estimated by Forbes in September 2017 at $2.5 billion. They and their wife own a Palm Beach, Fla., villa down the road from Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, another house in Southampton, N.Y., and a third home in Manhattan.
They also own an art collection with a value that Bloomberg has estimated at $250 million, including a collection of the surrealist painter Rene Magritte valued at $100 million.
Grand Swipe
Ross was also leader — known as the Grand Swipe — of a secret Wall Street fraternity called Kappa Beta Phi and in 2012 presided over an annual ceremony in which initiates performed song-and-dance routines in drag during a feast of lamb and foie gras at a Manhattan hotel, according to a New York Magazine report.
Ross has dismissed the idea that the very wealthiest have unfair advantages, arguing in 2014 that "the one per cent is being picked on for political reasons." They added: "Education is the way that people get out of the ghetto and into, if not the one per cent, something close to it."
According to Appleby records, Ross is a shareholder and was a director of two companies established in July 2011 as general partners to control two other WL Ross & Co entities that invested in the shipping industry, which, in turn, control two WL Ross Group funds. These funds invested in several shipping companies, including Navigator, according to SEC filings and Ross' ethics disclosures.
CBC used a slightly different methodology than ICIJ and found more than 100 additional Canadian entities in the data.
In all, Ross's former firm, WL Ross & Co., is Navigator's largest shareholder, owning 39.4 per cent of Navigator through companies it controls. When they became commerce secretary, Ross kept their personal financial interest in some of the WL Ross entities but resigned from managing them. The ones they kept a stake in, which also include other investors, own a substantial part of the larger stake with 31.5 per cent of the shipping company's stock.
Federal ethics law requires officials to recuse themselves from matters that would have "a direct and predictable" effect on the official's or a family member's financial interest or if the official has a close relationship that might cause a reasonable person to doubt the official's impartiality.
During their confirmation hearings, Ross sought to reassure senators that they would avoid any conflicts of interest between their business holdings and their cabinet post.
"I intend to be quite scrupulous about recusal and any topic where there is the slightest scintilla of doubt," they said.
CBC is part of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that produced this story but did not independently verify the specific allegations.
In the days leading up to their shooting rampage, Parliament Hill gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was accessing the Internet in at least two locations, one of which is known to be a hotspot for criminals, the Citizen has learned.
Zehaf-Bibeau registered for a library card in person at the main branch of the Ottawa Public Library on Metcalfe Street on Oct. 2 – the day they first arrived in Ottawa via Greyhound bus.
According to library policy, Zehaf-Bibeau was not able to physically borrow any items from the library since they wouldn't have been able to prove they had a valid address in Ottawa.
Without that ability, their card would have been limited to online privileges, which would let them use branch computers and access digital services from any other computer outside the library.
Zehaf-Bibeau continued to use the library computers several times in the 20 days before they were shot dead on Parliament Hill.
There are 1o standup workstations with desktop computers on the first floor of the main branch, approximately seven metres away from the information desk. One side faces the busy stairs, while the others face the shelves. All other computers on the first and second floor are catalogue-only.
On the third floor, there are rows of sit-down workstations with desktops – about 50 – which are all fairly open.
Around the corner sit two separate desks in the job-resource nook, which offer slightly more privacy.
The library also has mini-laptops that anyone with a library card can sign out for in-library use on the wifi connection.
On the same day they registered for the library card, Zehaf-Bibeau also registered for a bed at the Ottawa Mission, where residents say they were frequently seen using the Mission computers. Why Zehaf-Bibeau continued to access the Internet via two different locations is unclear, but police have long considered library computer terminals to be havens for the criminally minded, since their history logs purge themselves after each individual user signs off.
It is well-known by police forces, especially units that investigate child pornography, that libraries and other places that use unprotected wifi hot spots, such as coffee shops or fast food chains, are untraceable points of access.
It is nearly impossible to track the actions of someone who accessed the Internet from these public sites. As a result, police have to look at other ways of advancing any investigations, such as seizing video surveillance footage showing the suspect in the area using a computer.
The library refused to answer questions on whether RCMP have contacted administrators or seized any available records or data from the main branch in connection with their investigation of Zehaf-Bibeau.
“As the Oct 22nd incident is an active police investigation, we are unable to comment,” wrote Anna Basile, manager of planning and board support, in an email to the Citizen.
RCMP spokesperson Sgt. Greg Cox also declined to comment on use of the library, saying the ongoing Zehaf-Bibeau investigation precluded them from providing additional comment.
The library, however, did confirm that browsing history on all computers is immediately purged whenever a user logs off the system. Police can't access that information later.
Various types of websites are restricted by the library system but those restrictions depend on the user profile. All use is scanned for child pornography and what the library calls “malicious sites.”
It is now known that two days after their arrival in Ottawa – and after they registered for the library card and a bed at the Mission – Zehaf-Bibeau took a tour of the Centre Block, suggesting their later rampage from the National War Memorial to Parliament Hill was thought out in advance.
Zehaf-Bibeau had difficulty obtaining a passport while in Ottawa. ISIL – the violent organization known as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – has directed followers who are unable to travel abroad for battle to undertake attacks in their home countries.
When they rushed from the war memorial to attack Centre Block on Oct. 22, Zehaf-Bibeau had a knife – taken from their aunt's property in Mont-Tremblant – strapped to their body. The working RCMP theory is that they may have planned to behead a Canadian politician.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Plenty of people have said they aren`t thrilled with the choices this election season, but WREG has learned to put your own write-in on the ballot doesn't mean that vote will be counted.
"If I write in Bernie Sanders per say, I am sure my vote will be counted," one voter told us.
Most people assume write-in is just that. Y
ou can put down any name you wish and they will get your vote.
Not true, according to Shelby County's Administrator of Elections, Linda Phillips.
"You can write in anything you want, but it isn't going to count," they said.
That's because in Tennessee, a write-in candidate has to file as a write-in with the state 50 days before the election.
"The Secretary of State sends us a list. We don't publicize it. It's up to the write-in candidate to garner their own publicity and make people aware they are on the ballot as a write-in candidate," said Phillips.
Election officials now say there are several candidates that filed to be write-ins.
There will be a write-in slot on the ballot when early voting starts Wednesday and on election day.
The key is those candidates must be certified.
"There is a write-in line on each ballot. If the voter fills it out and there is no certified write-in, it won't count. We won't report it. We won't even look at it," said Phillips.
Those certified include:
Laurence Kotlikoff David Limbaugh Evan McMullin Marshall Schoenke Darrell L. Castle Cherunda Fox Tom Hoefling Kyle Kenley Kopitke
It's important information as election officials expect a large turnout for voting. In the last two days alone, they have processed 6,500 voter registration forms.
We also contacted election commissioners in Desoto and Crittenden County.
In Mississippi, there is also a filing deadline for write-ins.
In Arkansas, the only way your write-in candidate is counted is if any of the other candidates in that particular race withdraws, dies or is removed from running.
The Expected in Clemson vs. Alabama
Vismay Pandia Blocked Unblock Follow Jan 10, 2017
In a college football landscape where ups and downs of elite teams are defined not by winning seasons but by National Championships, there remains joy and tragedy in the expected. However in the unexpected, no matter how rare, the beauty seems to magnify and encompass the entirety of the game.
I will admit: my college football fandom is limited. The occasional big SEC match up and depressing viewings of Indiana away games dominates my TV set. However as a sports fan and a follower of #TeamChaos, the chance to witness Clemson beating Alabama was too perfect to miss out on. Like any sports viewer/tweeter/complainer, I had my pregame take:
The story lines were plentiful. Alabama's defense was possibly the best defense in their long history. Deshaun Watson will play their final college game against the same team they lost to in the 2016 National Championship. Alabama's freaking dynasty (again). The buzz, drama, and the craze was entirely present before the game even started, yet we were still star-struck and amazed such a game could even occur.
Ronald Martinez-Getty Images
Throughout the game, many were thinking with each definitive Alabama play, “This is it for Clemson. Bama is back on top.” Not because we wanted to be right — but it felt right. During the Saban era, we have been taught not to underestimate Alabama, insomuch to never believe in the possibility of them losing on the big stage. Winning 4 out of 8 beer pong games will earn you house honors but 4 of 8 National College Football Championships? There are few reasons to doubt ever again . Clemson may have never been a real underdog but against Alabama, even the well-matched teams are viewed as Davids.
Then Wayne Gallman ran it one yard in for a touchdown. It happened. Clemson had the lead. With 4:38 left in the 4th quarter, usually we would feel a moment of relief. Yes, that should be enough time to hold out. We just need four more stops. Milk the clock as much as you can. However, the traditional maxims did not apply, and Jalen Hurts ran it 30 yards for the lead.
Watson had the ball with 2:05 left in the game. Every story line we read leading to this game will be answered in the next 2:05 minutes of game time. All questions will be solved, and all debates, settled.
The irony is Alabama fans likely preached the same prayers ever non-Alabama fan preaches every game: Yes, that should be enough time to hold out. We just need four more stops. Milk the clock as much as you can. Perhaps that is where Watson and Clemson really won — making the giant appear normal, common with the man.
The catch, the flag, the pick play. It sealed the fate for Watson, Dabo Swinney, and Clemson. The story lines solved and the debates settled, but not the way anyone predicted.
SEC Country
This game should never be referred to as a “David and Goliath” narrative or a “Cinderella Story,” none of that. In the minds and hearts of every single Clemson Tiger player, coach, and staff, beating Alabama was expected. This mindset has been drilled into their minds since Day 1. That's how sports works: against all odds, winning is expected for those who expect winning. For the viewers/tweeters/complainers, winning is a stat, a narrative, a history.
For them, the joy and tragedy comes with the expectation of a win. For us, the moment that moves us to bewilderment and to fantasize more of the unbelievable paints an unexpected picture that can only be described in one word: beautiful.
kelsyabbott asked: What the hell is happening??
So about a month ago I posted to the #YesAllWomen hashtag on Twitter & spoke openly as a rape victim. When I did this, I got inundated with a ton of harassment & rape threats.
https://twitter.com/solikebasically/status/479962835192004608
https://twitter.com/solikebasically/status/477665289803296768
Most of the time my response would be to block & report, but once in a while I'd take a screenshot of what the person said & then reply telling them to fuck off eternally into the night, etc. One of the people who harassed me for speaking up about my rape happened to be a 13 year old kid. I did not know this, because I was getting hundreds of replies & I don't thoroughly investigate every account with 15 followers that responds to me with bullshit. I responded with this scathing little gem
https://twitter.com/solikebasically/status/481205303984144384
& then a follower of mine, I guess looked at this person's account & saw it was a kid who had recently posted a link to their personal facebook. The kid's entire timeline at that time was them responding to/trolling the #YesAllWomen hashtag, arguing with rape victims & condemning feminism, you know, because that's the world we live in right now. So this guy, crushingbort responded to a separate tweet the kid made about how comedians who make rape jokes are totally cool, & they posted a picture of the kid hugging their cat from their facebook, saying something like, “Joshua, you should really lock your facebook” or something. I thought this was hilarious because honestly, if you're big boy enough to harass rape victims for being raped, you're big boy enough to deal with the consequences. I had nothing to do with this, though. Then, about a month later, some pathetic Men's Rights Activists found this exchange & went fucking ballistic, focusing all their rage on me, saying I “sexually harassed a child”, that I “doxxed a child” (I had nothing to do with the posting of their photo, but that's not even doxxing at all, the kid themselves said this). They went on a crusade against me using this kid as a flimsy excuse because they hate women & want to punish them. I received a ton of rape threats & even death threats.
https://twitter.com/solikebasically/status/489749497153462272/photo/1

https://twitter.com/solikebasically/status/490242273997639680
I had to lock my Twitter account to slow it down because I was getting about 4 per minute. They posted my personal information on 4chan & apparently attempted to post my little sister's information too, but that was a tip I got & I didn't see it anywhere so I'm not sure if it really happened. I started reporting all the threats to the FBI & got set up with a civil rights attorney, but a judge said I wouldn't get the result I was hoping for unless the threats were “more direct”, like mentioning my location within the threat, my personal information within the threat, etc.
The kid themselves knows that these MRAs are using them as an excuse to persecute women for whatever reason, & has told them to lay off, but you can't reason with these idiots.
https://twitter.com/solikebasically/status/490604177328832512/photo/1
I've started ignoring it & they've eased up on the threats & have moved on to filing false reports with the Houston police department trying to say that I'm a pedophile or a child abuser & trying to blackmail me for being a child abuser or some shit, but that doesn't bother me because it's obviously all false.
So essentially, this is just what women with a voice have to deal with online. This is all because I spoke up about rape & being a rape victim, & this is just what I have to expect now. If I get any other threats that are “direct enough”, I'll definitely jump on pursuing it legally, but until then, this is just what I'm dealing with. NEAT, HUH?!!?!?
Do you hanker after global internet domination, à la Mail Online? Come on now, be honest - don't we all? Well now anyone can have a go, thanks to Rob Manuel, the man behind techie humour website B3ta, who has knocked up this handy guide: "How to edit the Daily Mail website". Key website front page elements include "HUGE Royal Box as semi-permament fixture" (sic) featuring "Pippa Middleton. Nice arse eh?

But don't forget Mail Online's secret weapon, the crack-cocaine of its formidable arsenal: the "FEMAIL TODAY" righthand column, for which the formula is "Soft Porn, soft porn, creepy long lens pics of celebrity's children frolicking on a beach, soft porn". Now, sit back and watch the traffic stats go bananas. Simples!
Continuing with our guide to stock market data, in this post we will detail the various databases available for analyst ratings and targets, options, futures and indexes, and alternative data. If you haven't yet read Part One then you may do so by visiting here or else continue reading for Part Two.
Analyst Ratings and Targets
Understanding what other investors and analysts expect from a stock is a key component of forecasting that stock accurately. In certain cases, rosy analyst ratings may reflect a healthy underlying company; in other cases, they may reflect a consensus that is ripe to be faded. Either way, they constitute important data for the informed quant.
Analyst ratings and stock buy/sell recommendations are important. Equally important are the trends in ratings and recommendations. Trend surveys help anchor and contextualize ratings that would otherwise be abstract and theoretical.
For example, if every analyst of a stock downgrades that stock, it does not matter what the absolute rating is for that stock; the price is likely to go down (since the prior stock price encapsulated the former rating, by the efficient markets hypothesis). History and revisions data for stock ratings is thus a critical component of the quantitative toolkit.
Quandl has several ratings databases, ranging from simple buy/sell recommendations and comprehensive prediction databases to historical revisions and trends in analyst forecasts. Some of these are listed below:
Market Consensus Master– Complete view of market consensus: earnings, sales, surprises, growth, buy/sell ratings and target prices. Includes all Zacks analyst survey databases. Includes dividend data for free!
Analyst Recommendations– Daily buy/sell recommendations for 5,000 publicly traded companies, from 2,600 analysts at 185 firms.
Analyst Revisions– Recent estimate and ratings revisions from individual contributing brokers and analysts, updated daily.
Analyst Rating History– Historical estimate and ratings revisions for 5,000 companies going back to 1995, updated monthly.
Target Price History– Historical and current analyst target prices and revisions for 5,000 publicly traded companies
Active Analyst Ratings– Crowd-sourced ratings and recommendations, filtered to include only active analysts.
Ownership and Trading Activity
Sometimes the best predictors of a stock's performance come from observing the actions – not the opinions — of other market participants.
High-frequency trading (HFT) algorithms, corporate insiders, and institutional investors all affect stock prices in significant ways and they often have specialized information and/or incentives. Knowing how they are acting is an essential part of the analyst's toolkit.
Many technical trading strategies are based on identifying levels of support, resistance, strength and weakness in the market, which are manifestations in price space of the aggregate activities of many other traders. These too are important pieces of information for the stock market analyst.
In some cases, market participant actions are publicly known, albeit usually with a lag, due to regulatory reporting requirements. In other cases, it is possible to infer actions from secondary signals, using clever analytical techniques. Inferred signals may be less accurate but they are more valuable to traders since they are largely contemporaneous with the actual market activity they measure.
Institutional Ownership Data– Detailed institutional ownership information for 6,000 US equities
Insider Metrics– Holdings and transactions for company insiders, from SEC Form 4 filings. Officers and Directors tracked separately
Holder Metrics– Holder metrics for institutional and insider shareowners; focus on distribution, rotation, concentration and holder style
Stock Options, Volatility and Risk
Stock option prices and volumes encapsulate a huge amount of information about the stock: bullish and bearish sentiment, expected riskiness, time horizons of market participants, position size, breakeven points, cost and stop levels, and much more. The experienced analyst can glean a wealth of market positioning data merely by inspecting activity in the options market.
Quandl has a variety of stock option data. The basics include current and historical stock option prices and stock option volatility, calculated both close-to-close and tick-by-tick. More advanced data includes put/call ratios, open-interest ratios, skew and smile analytics, breakevens, risk factors and more. The following databases are available on Quandl:
Stock Futures and Indexes
Stock futures and stock indexes offer alternative methods for participants to gain exposure to equity markets. They allow investors to target specific sectors and styles in a much more efficient manner than buying/selling dozens of individual names. Furthermore, in many cases, futures and indexes are more liquid than the underlying constituent stocks; they are also easier to take short positions in. For these reasons, stock futures and indexes often see more trading volume than individual stock tickers.
Index arbitrage involves buying and selling stocks as they enter or leave an index, in anticipation of subsequent position rotation by large institutional players. (Stocks that are part of major indexes command a premium versus those that are not). This is a lucrative source of returns for analysts who can successfully predict index composition changes, using stock fundamentals or other data.
Continuous Futures Contracts– Long-term chained histories for 78 futures contracts accounting for the majority of US trading volume; choice of roll-date and price-adjustment methods for concatenation
Reference Futures Contracts– Price series for 12,000 individual futures contracts. 50 symbols, 50 years of history; Covers major US and global exchanges.
Eurex Futures– Price histories for 70 contracts traded on Eurex, including DAX, Stoxx, MSCI World.
LIFFE Commodities Futures– Price histories for 50 contracts traded on LIFFE, including AEX, BEL, CAC, PSI, TOPIX, FTSE
Global Index Prices– Definitive collection of global equity indexes; all major benchmarks included; decades of history.
Global Index Data– Over 35,000 sector and style indexes, including global equity, FI, green, Nordic and Sharia; published by NASDAQ OMX
Alternative Data
In addition to hosting core financial databases, Quandl is also the premier source for alternative data, that is, data which produces an informational advantage for professional investors. Armed with this data, investors are able to beat benchmarks and generate what is known as “alpha” in Wall Street's parlance. But previously unknown information rarely remains that way, which is why investors are always looking for new sources of alpha. We call this concept the diffusion of alpha.
Here at Quandl, we invest significant time and resources into sourcing only the highest quality alternative data. It begins with a market hypothesis, thorough analysis and data cleaning before our sales and marketing teams connect the right investor with the right product. As we hope to preserve the alpha within, we are often highly selective about who can buy and how many times we can sell a particular dataset.
Alternative data sources can cover a very broad range of sectors and asset classes. Examples of datasets used by investment professionals can include:
Automotive — GPS and telematics data from cars
— GPS and telematics data from cars Sentiment Data — Data sourced via natural language processing to aggregate a subjective opinion
— Data sourced via natural language processing to aggregate a subjective opinion Business to Business — Business health metrics from credit platforms
— Business health metrics from credit platforms Customer Insights — App downloads and usage from telecommunications providers
— App downloads and usage from telecommunications providers Human Resources — Job listing data from digital job boards
— Job listing data from digital job boards Logistics — Cargo transport data recorded through device-equipped fleets
— Cargo transport data recorded through device-equipped fleets Retail — Consumer footfall and transaction data
The variety of alternative data for alpha generation continues to increase. If you are an institutional investor interested in any of these alternative databases, please contact us.

Bottom Line: The quality of the U.S. diet showed some modest improvement in the last decade in large measure because of a reduction in the consumption of unhealthy trans fats, but the gap in overall diet quality widened between the rich and the poor.
Author: Dong D. Wang, M.D., M.Sc., of the Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, and colleagues.
Background: An unhealthy diet is closely linked to cardiovascular disease, diabetes and some cancers. Eating a healthy diet is an important part of the strategy to prevent adverse health outcomes. Evaluating population trends in diet quality is important because it can offer guidance for public health policy.
How the Study Was Conducted: The authors used the Alternate Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010) to investigate trends in diet quality in the U.S. adult population from 1999 to 2010 using a sample of 29,124 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). A higher AHEI-2010 score indicated a more healthful diet. The index's components were scored from 0 to 10. For fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes, long-chain omega-3 fats and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), a higher score corresponded to higher intake. For trans fat, sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juices, red and/or processed meat and sodium, a higher score corresponded to lower intake. The authors used a recently updated index, the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI-2010) for further analysis.
Results: The energy-adjusted average AHEI-2010 score increased from 39.9 in 1999- 2000 to 46.8 in 2009- 2010. Reduced trans fat intake accounted for more than half of this improvement. Scores increased by 0.9 points for sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice reflecting decreased consumption. Score increases of 0.7 points for whole fruit, 0.5 points for whole grains, 0.5 points for PUFAs and 0.4 points for nuts and legumes reflected increased consumption. A decrease in scores for sodium reflected greater consumption. Having a lower body mass index (BMI) also was associated with dietary improvement. Diet quality scores in the high-socioeconomic status (SES) group, associated with both income and education, were consistently higher than in the lower-SES groups and that gap widened over time from 3.9 points in 1999-2000 to 7.8 points in 2009-2010.
Discussion: “Our study suggests that the overall dietary quality of the U.S. population steadily improved from 1999 through 2010. This improvement reflected favorable changes in both consumers' food choices and food processing, especially the reduction of trans fat intake, that were likely motivated by both public policy and nutrition education. However, overall dietary quality remains poor, indicating room for improvement and presenting challenges for both public health researchers and policymakers. Furthermore, substantial differences in dietary quality were seen across levels of SES, and the gap between those with the highest and lowest levels increased over time.”

Commentary: Growing Socioeconomic Disparity in Dietary Quality
In a related commentary, Takehiro Sugiyama, M.D., Ph.D., of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, and Martin F. Shapiro, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of California, Los Angeles, write: “The growing chasm in dietary quality by SES confronts us with the possibility that the governmental efforts to mind this gap have been insufficient. It is disappointing that the improvement seen in those of higher SES was not seen in the lower-SES group.”
“How could we close the dietary quality gap? First, we could restrict benefits to more healthful foods, as has been done by the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), which restricts purchasable foods with the benefit,” they continue.
“Other strategies to improve dietary quality include providing healthful foods to students and residents in underserved areas,” they note.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has sustained significant political damage in the wake of the traffic scandal that has threatened the Republican's presidential aspirations, according to a new poll.
The Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey out Tuesday found that 29 percent of Americans view Christie positively and 22 percent view them negatively, a sharp change from an October poll that showed 33 percent of Americans viewing them positively and just 17 percent negatively. Christie, who was reelected last year with wide support across party lines, has seen their favorability ratings hit a roadblock with Democrats and political moderates, according to the poll.

Christie, a leading GOP contender for the White House in 2016, has been under fire ever since documents surfaced earlier this month showing that aides worked to purposely snarl traffic in a north Jersey town, acting out an apparent political payback scheme after the town's mayor didn't endorse Christie's reelection bid. Christie has apologized, fired a top aide and said they knew nothing of the scheme. But the so-called “Bridgegate” scandal, in which lanes leading from Fort Lee, N.J., to the George Washington Bridge were closed, has emboldened Democrats in the state legislature to probe the matter and attracted the interest of federal investigators. The latest survey breaks from a different poll two weeks ago that found one-third of voters hadn't changed their opinion of Christie in the wake of the scandal.
In a troublesome sign for Christie as they look to move past the issue, almost 80 percent of Americans say they're familiar with the scandal, according to the poll. Americans are divided on whether Christie is telling the truth in saying they had no prior knowledge of the scheme; 42 percent say he's being honest, 44 percent say he's not.
The poll of 800 adults, conducted Jan. 22 to Jan. 25, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.46 percent.

An organization that manages transmission systems across the central US announced on Tuesday that it broke a record for wind penetration in North America. On Sunday at 4:30am, Southwest Power Pool (SPP) became the first regional transmission organization (RTO) to serve 52.1 percent of its load using wind energy.
SPP also set the previous record in April 2016 with 49.2 percent wind generation. A record previous to that was set by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) in late March 2016, when the organization hit 48.28 percent wind penetration at 1:10am.
Windy weather
Why does it seem like all the wind penetration records are broken in late winter to early spring? Derek Winfield, SPP's corporate communications representative, wrote to Ars to explain: “At least in our footprint, that's a time of year that's typically both mild and windy. That means lower total load on our system (due to less power being used to heat/cool homes and businesses, at least in part) and more of that load able to be served by wind.”
Records for wind penetration, which measure the amount of total load supplied by wind on a moment-to-moment basis, are being broken more frequently these days, on a regional and internal level. As RTOs, which generally serve large areas and cross state lines, add more wind turbines to their portfolios, wind is becoming a more important part of the energy mix. SPP noted that “wind is now the third most-prevalent fuel source in the SPP region,” which covers 550,000 square miles of territory in Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and portions of neighboring states. Natural gas and coal are still the primary fuel sources for SPP, but the organization said that wind accounted for 15 percent of its generating capacity in 2016.
“SPP's maximum simultaneous wind generation peak rose from 9,948 MW in 2015 to 12,336 MW in early 2016,” the organization added.
In a statement included in SPP's press release, Vice President of Operations Bruce Rew gave the new numbers some context. “Ten years ago, we thought hitting even a 25 percent wind-penetration level would be extremely challenging, and any more than that would pose serious threats to reliability… Now we have the ability to reliably manage greater than 50 percent wind penetration. It's not even our ceiling. We continue to study even higher levels of renewable, variable generation as part of our plans to maintain a reliable and economic grid of the future.”
In early 2016, SPP officials told regulators that based on a 2015 study, the transmission system it manages could “‘reliably handle' wind representing up to 60% of internal SPP load,” although the organization cautioned that it would need to install “voltage reactive support capabilities for existing wind farms” as well as “enhanced operations tools, to monitor real-time voltage stability limits,” among other recommendations.
In its press release today, SPP credited its ability to handle so much wind penetration to the size of the organization's footprint. “Even if the wind stops blowing in the upper Great Plains, we can deploy resources waiting in the Midwest and Southwest to make up any sudden deficits,” Rew said. That versatility is also helped by a recent and massive investment; in 2012, SPP approved a 10-year, $1.7 billion transmission expansion plan to help meet renewables goals.
The stalemate continues over the question of when to destroy the last stocks of the virus that causes smallpox, a killer disease that was eradicated in 1980. One of the World Health Organization's (WHO) two advisory committees on smallpox supports the stocks' destruction, and the other opposes it. Last weekend, health ministers of the WHO's 194 member states again postponed a decision and decided to set up a third WHO smallpox advisory committee in a bid to broker a consensus.
The issue came up again on the agenda of the annual meeting of the World Health Assembly, the WHO's top decision-making body, which was held in Geneva, Switzerland, from 19 to 24 May. It was last discussed at the 2011 assembly, which reaffirmed that the stocks of the variola virus should be destroyed but deferred to this year's meeting discussion on any date of destruction.
A central question remains whether research of public-health importance is still needed on the virus, or whether the last stocks should be destroyed to eliminate the threat of an accidental release from the two labs where they are held — at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Russian State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology in Koltsovo, near Novosibirsk.
The final agenda of this year's meeting, however, asked ministers only to take note of a WHO update report to the assembly on progress on completing needed research. The WHO's ‘advisory committee on variola virus research' (ACVVR), which oversees and approves any research using the stocks, felt that live virus was no longer needed to develop diagnostics and vaccines, but was still needed to develop antiviral drugs. By contrast, its ‘advisory group of independent experts to review the smallpox research programme' (AGIES) felt that there was no research justification for holding on to the stocks.
Although the ACVVR reached a consensus on antivirals, there was considerable debate about this among its members. Some argued, for example, that with two promising drugs — tecovirimat and brincidofovir — close to licensing, virus stocks were no longer needed. Others felt that the virus should be kept in case these drugs failed to get licensed, requiring the development of other compounds.
The AGIES considered the same issues but swung towards virus being no longer needed to develop antivirals — it also suggested that should a future need arise to develop new drugs, live virus could in any case be recreated from viral DNA. The ACVVR is often perceived as being more focused on research interests, and the AGIES on public-health aspects.
By the time the WHO assembly got to discussion of destruction of smallpox stocks, it was near the end of the last day of the meeting. It quickly became clear that there were sharply divided opinions and no consensus, according to Glenn Thomas, a WHO spokesperson. The decision to setup a third expert group is intended to bring together a mix of scientists and public-health and other experts to review all the elements of the debate and take the issue forward, says Thomas.
For the moment, the precise terms of reference of the group, or its composition, have yet to be decided. The latter will be important, as the destruction of the variola stocks is also a political issue. The United State is strongly opposed to destruction of the virus stocks, largely because — like many other developed countries — it wants to pursue research that it believes might help to protect against a bioweapons attack by rogue states or terrorists, who may have access to undeclared stocks (see ‘WHO to decide fate of smallpox stocks‘).
Some scientists are also keen for smallpox research using live virus not to be stopped, but continued and expanded. Two members of the ACVVR, Clarissa Damaso, of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, and Grant McFadden, of the University of Florida in Gainesville, have argued, for example, that the WHO's restricting of smallpox research to tightly circumscribed public-health applications has limited fundamental research that could advance public health. In an opinion piece published 1 May in the journal PLoS Pathogens, along with Inger Damon, head of the poxvirus and rabies branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, they argue that: “the research agenda with live variola virus is not yet finished and that significant gaps still remain”.
But the majority of the health ministers of the WHO member states — including those of many poorer countries, who view the risks of an accidental release as outweighing any research benefits — want the stocks of virus destroyed at some point. The question for the WHO assembly is, as always, when? But yet again, it has kicked that can down the road.
Swedish Finance Minister: Stockholm made a mistake accepting so many refugees Friday, December 22, 2017 1:00:40 PM
The Swedish finance minister, Magdalena Andersson, in a Friday interview for the newspaper Dagens Nyheter said that Sweden made a mistake by accepting thousands of asylum seekers in 2015.
It is the first such statement of the politician from the ruling Sweden's Socialist Working Party, whose coalition government together with the Green Party, welcomed over 163 thousand asylum seekers in 2015.
"The integration [of immigrants] does not go as it should. We had a problem with it before the autumn of 2015 (when Sweden accepted a wave of migrants). For me it is obvious that we cannot accept more asylum seekers than we can integrate. It will not be good either for people who come here or for the whole society," said the Swedish Finance minister Magdalena Andersson.
According to the politician, people who come to Sweden "face a very tense situation" while greater housing and education opportunities exist in other European countries.
"I think these people [immigrants] have a better chance if they seek asylum in another country," Andersson admitted.
The Minister of Finance told the newspaper Dagens Nyheter that their own Social Democratic Workers Party was to blame for the tense situation in Sweden in connection with the admission of immigrants on such a massive scale.
"We have a reason for self-criticism, it should have been clear beforehand that we were not able to accept more people than our country can cope with" - said Magdalena Andersson.
In August 2015, the Swedish Prime Minister, Stefan Löfven said at a rally in Stockholm that Europe “should not build walls”. In November of the same year, as a result of the wave of migration, the Swedish government decided to restore border control and tighten immigration regulations.
When asked what should be done to allow integration of people who obtained the right of residence in Sweden, Magdalena Andersson replied that their entry into the labor market must be faster.
"The children must grow up and see that their parents work. More families must have adequate housing conditions and children should learn what they need at school. There are no other requirements for people who came here than for us who were born in Sweden "- said the Minister of Finance.
The level of unemployment in Sweden among people born in the country is just over 4 percent. Unemployment among people living in Sweden and born in another country reaches 15 percent.

A recent study thought to be the first of its kind has found that regular cannabis use may make a person less prone to anxiety over time, even when sober.
The study, published in the medical journal Psychopharmacology, found that people who use cannabis daily or almost daily had a blunted stress reaction when exposed to a high-stress situation after a period of abstinence from marijuana. While non-cannabis users reported feeling anxious and experienced elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol when stressed, chronic cannabis users reported lower levels of anxiety, and their cortisol levels remained the same under high stress as they they were under no stress.
Dr. Carrie Cuttler, study co-author “The potential effects of cannabis on stress do appear to extend beyond the period of intoxication.”
The research involved 40 people who had used cannabis chronically over the previous year and 42 people who'd used cannabis no more than 10 times in their lives and not at all in the previous year. All participants abstained from using cannabis from 12 to 18 hours prior to the study.
“Based on our findings, the potential effects of cannabis on stress do appear to extend beyond the period of intoxication,” Dr. Carrie Cuttler, a researcher and clinical assistant professor at Washington State University and co-author of the study, told Leafly.
“But,” they caution, “We're not yet comfortable saying whether that muted stress response is a good thing or a bad thing.”
We do know that too much cortisol is definitely a bad thing. It's been associated with everything from anxiety and depression to digestive issues, heart disease, insomnia and memory problems. But too little cortisol can also be problematic, since the hormone helps us tap into stored energy and respond appropriately to stressful situations.
Cuttler says further research is needed to determine whether the lowered cortisol response exhibited by chronic cannabis users is ultimately therapeutic or detrimental when it comes to managing anxiety long-term. They add that they did, however, make a promising finding regarding cannabis and dependency.
“We looked at the withdrawal symptoms of chronic users to see if they experienced heightened levels of and cannabis cravings when stressed,” they reveal, “and surprisingly, we didn't find any evidence that they did.”
Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the US. An estimated 40 million American adults, or just over 18% of the population, are affected by anxiety disorders every year.
Benzodiazepines like Xanax and Klonopin are often prescribed for short-term relief from acute anxiety and panic attacks. While they're incredibly effective in the short term, side effects can include fatigue, confusion, and disorientation, and tolerance and dependency can develop quickly — in 2015, over 8,000 Americans died by overdosing on benzodiazepines.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Prozac and Zoloft are often prescribed for long-term relief from anxiety disorders, but they come with their own long lists of potential negative side effects ranging from insomnia and drowsiness to headaches, low libido, and increased risk of suicidal thoughts.
Anxiety is also among the most commonly cited reasons for cannabis use, and research suggests that it has relatively few negative side effects, low potential for addiction and virtually no risk for an overdose. But because it remains classified as a schedule 1 drug at the federal level, little research has been done to investigate the long-term therapeutic potential of cannabis to treat anxiety—until Cuttler's recent study.
Next, Cuttler and their colleagues plan to repeat the study with a longer period of cannabis abstinence to see whether their findings still hold true. They also eventually hope to replicate the study with rats to confirm their findings.
“One of the limitations of this research is that we can't ethically manipulate who uses cannabis daily and who does not,” Cuttler explains. “So while our research indicates that they have a blunted stress response, it could be that people who are already less prone to stress are also more prone to being chronic cannabis users. With rats, we can manipulate both stress and cannabis.”
Another recent study published in Pharmacological Research found that cannabidiol (CBD) may enhance the efficacy of the neurotransmitter GABA, which works to counteract and calm the chemicals triggered by cortisol in the brain's anxiety response, like glucose. While high doses of THC actually have the potential to cause increased anxiety, CBD is non-intoxicating, so it doesn't carry the same same risk.
While all of this emerging research is promising, Cuttler emphasizes that when it comes to anxiety, neither marijuana nor pharmaceuticals should ever be the first course of treatment.
“As a psychologist, I believe Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the ideal treatment for anxiety,” they say. “In the short term, anti-anxiety meds and CBT have equivalent outcomes, but long-term, the effects of eight to 10 CBT sessions outlast those of medications without any of the negative side effects. I see cannabis the same way — it may help treat the symptoms of anxiety, but it won't address the root cause.”
Greg Vanney's decision to take off Sebastian Giovinco with a little over 15 minutes to play until penalties seemed questionable at the time.
A lot will be said with the benefit of hindsight, but not trying Seba in midfield or keeping them on for penalties is a huge call. #TFCLive — Waking the Red (@WakingtheRed) December 11, 2016
Toronto FC's go-to option late in games during the MLS playoffs has been to drop Sebastian Giovinco into midfield with Jozy Altidore and Tosaint Ricketts ahead of him, but when Ricketts appeared late in the MLS Cup final on Saturday night it was the Italian who made way.
As it turns out, the change was forced. Giovinco, who was substituted with what was said at the time to be cramp in the second leg of Toronto's conference final against the Montreal Impact, asked to come off because they “couldn't move”.
Greg Vanney says that Seba told them that they could no longer play. It was not a decision they wanted to make subbing them out of the match. — Danielle Emanuele (@dee_emanuele) December 11, 2016
It was not the moment that Toronto lost the MLS Cup - Altidore and Ricketts both had huge chances to win the game - but it was undoubtedly a major blow when the shootout that followed is considered.
Alex Jones is taking aim at Ivanka Trump after they made public comments suggesting an openness to the U.S. accepting Syrian refugees.
Jones wrote Thursday that President Trump's elder daughter sounds like Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' Former Sanders campaign spokesperson: Clinton staff are 'biggest a--holes in American politics' MORE when they talk about public policy.
"Ivanka Trump's policies are sounding a lot like Hillary Clinton, and we didn't want Clinton in the White House," Jones wrote in a post on InfoWars.

Ivanka Trump earlier this week said a discussion about allowing Syrian refugees into the U.S. needed to be a part of talks surrounding solving the crisis.
"I think there is a global humanitarian crisis that's happening and we have to come together and we have to solve it," Trump told NBC's "Today."
Asked whether that includes opening the borders to Syrian refugees, Trump responded, "That has to be part of the discussion, but that's not going to be enough in it of itself."
Conservatives have frequently worried that Ivanka Trump, who holds an office in the White House, will have too much influence on their father.
In a video posted below the text, Jones said the country did not elect Ivanka Trump to be president. They said they think she's "talented" and "beautiful," adding that they have nothing against them personally.
"We didn't elect them And she's over in Germany with Merkel, that opened the borders up for all the Islamisists ... and they say for women we should let refugees in and that their dad's wrong and they want them to change their mind," said Jones, who repeatedly reiterated that the country did not elect Ivanka Trump.
"ISIS is being defeated right now ... Trump's keeping their promise on that."
Jones said that many Muslim countries are not tolerant.
"And that's a fact," they said. "That's not Islamophobia. That's the reality that they're not tolerant."
Jones also urged people not to get "depressed" that Trump hasn't yet gotten everything done or that their daughter is "doing bizarre stuff."
"Because we have come to being a tiny fringe movement against globalism a decade ago, 20 years ago, to now," they said.
Jones has often promoted baseless conspiracy theories through InfoWars, including that the U.S. government was behind the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 and the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

My vegetable garden came about when I decided to, as they say, make lemonade from lemons.
Opportunity knocked when the health department called to say someone had complained about the compost heap I keep in the side alley. So, to salvage neighborhood relations, I determined to turn the sore spot into a garden plot.
Initially, I asked my gourmet-cook husband to join me in a trip to the farmers' market to buy heirloom seedlings and the herbs we always grow in pots. (I'll try anything to get them interested in gardening.)
Then it clouded over, and I ended up at the hardware store on the corner that this year was featuring heirloom vegetables. I bought 12 tomato plants in six varieties, including the fabled Brandywine. I purchased only indeterminate plants. These are vines that don't stop growing once they've produced a crop. I wanted my tomatoes to keep coming as long as the weather allowed. To that end, I also loaded up on plants with early maturity dates. That means cherry tomatoes as well as Brandywines.
Some plants on the shelf below the tomatoes caught my eye – the pictures on the labels, that is. Melons. The plants themselves (two per pot, male and female) were no taller than my thumb and had two leaves each.
My dad was a melon addict and used to take us kids to the fruit stand once a week in summer to load up on melons as well as corn, raspberries, strawberries and whatever else was sweet and in season. Dad had a killer sweet tooth.
That the hardware-store melons were plain old cantaloupes didn't bother me. Dad's more exotic types were unreliable and prone to rot. Besides, my real desire was to see melon vines flowing extravagantly, almost like leafy green rivers, bedecked with pretty yellow flowers and the odd (I mean really odd), fuzzy, pickle-shaped protuberance that is the melon embryo. I'd seen this only in magazines, and I couldn't wait.
I'd heard that melons like to climb up fences, but that's not why I put a fence around my side-alley vegetable patch. The fence was to keep the tomatoes upright and to frighten off would-be thieves – animal and otherwise. In front of the vegetables as a further deterrent, I planted a row of thorny hybrid tea roses that Jackson & Perkins had asked me to trial.
BOUNTEOUS FRUITS
The melons have fully carpeted the fenced-in area, and their vines are excavating a trench under the wires to get outside. They've pretty much eliminated the fence from view. That isn't hard when you have leaves as big around as dinner plates.
Behind them, the tomatoes have grown so tall I may need a stepladder to pick the high hanging fruit.
This has been a great summer for vegetables if you have a sunny spot and a long soaker hose. I'm thinking of asking one of the many entrepreneurial 8-year-olds in the neighborhood if he'd like to hawk my tomatoes and melons along with theirs lemonade.
I'll stop bragging and pass on some tips:
I just placed one of the elongated melon embryos in a nylon stocking to give it support, as the vines do want to climb up the fence rather than hug the dirt.
Melons and tomatoes need intense heat and sun.
Tomatoes like it a lot better in the ground than in pots. A former compost heap is a great place to plant them because they're heavy feeders. I add tomato fertilizer occasionally.
Blossom end rot on tomatoes – identifiable by a black spot on the fruit where it leaves the vine – is caused by uneven soil moisture.
Harvesting tomatoes when they're just turning pink stimulates more blooming and protects the exposed fruit from hungry varmints. Ripen them indoors at room temperature.
Weeds compete with any plant for nutrients and water. During this dry summer, I'm trying to keep the patch weed-free. That's not hard when the neighbors who used to glare at me when they looked at my compost heap are now stopping by to chat.
I'm adding a postscript because you deserve to know the whole truth: My hardware-store melons turned out not to be ‘Sugar Baby' watermelons, not cantaloupe. When I called to ask if anyone else had watermelons instead of cantaloupe, the “gardening expert” on duty passed the buck. Somebody at the nursery wasn't paying attention when they inserted the labels, they said. “Must've been Friday afternoon or something.”
I declined the offer to return the plants for a refund. Maybe I'll take them some watermelon.

THIS WEEK'S CHECKLIST
Pick tomatoes as they turn pink and let them ripen indoors at room temperature. That way, varmints won't be tempted, and disease will be less likely. Plus, picking stimulates more fruiting. (Indeterminate tomatoes keep going indefinitely; the bush varieties come all at once and then call it quits for the season.)
Keep annuals looking fresh by deadheading and cutting off bedraggled foliage. Remember: They need more water in dry weather. Don't overfertilize to compensate for lackluster performance – plants stressed by drought shouldn't be asked to perform miracles.
Speaking of dry, look up and check out those trees. They may be feeling the heat, too, especially newcomers to your garden that haven't established extensive root systems. Put the hose on them if their leaves are yellowing or falling off.
English muffins are a small, round, flat yeast-leavened bread which is commonly sliced horizontally, toasted, and buttered.[2] Toasted English muffins, which are often used in the United States as a breakfast food, may be served with sweet toppings (e.g., fruit jam, or honey) or savory toppings (e.g., eggs, sausage rounds, bacon, or cheese). English muffins are also used as the bread in a variety of breakfast sandwiches, and are an essential ingredient in Eggs Benedict and most of its variations.
In the United States and U.S.-influenced territories, they are called English muffins to distinguish them from U.S. muffins, which are larger and sweeter miniature baked quick breads. They are very similar to bolo do caco in Portuguese cuisine.
Origin [ edit ]
The word muffin is thought to be Low German muffen meaning "little cakes".[3] In the past, muffins were sold door to door by hawkers in England as a snack bread before most houses were provided with ovens in the early nineteenth century, giving rise to the traditional English nursery rhyme "The Muffin Man", which dates from 1820 at the latest[4].

United States [ edit ]
References to English muffins appear in U.S. newspapers starting in 1859,[5][6][7] and detailed descriptions of them and recipes were published as early as 1870.[8][9]
Samuel Bath Thomas emigrated from Plymouth, England, to New York City in 1874.[10] By 1880 they had opened their own bakery at 163 Ninth Avenue. Using their mother's recipe, they began making 'English' muffins at their Ninth Avenue bakery in 1880, selling them from the bakery to hotels and grocery stores. They were soft and spongy after baking like traditional muffins, but were also pre-cut, which was later called "fork-split", so as to be able to be pulled apart, giving a rougher toasting surface than would be obtained by slicing. Later they were baked in ovens.[11] They became popular as an alternative to toast; Thomas opened a second bakery around the corner from the first at 337 West 20th Street in a building that remains known as "The Muffin House".[12]
Muffin House, Manhattan
The Merriam-Webster dictionary gives the origin of the term English Muffin as 1902. In a trademark filing in 1926, it was stated that the Thomas' name of the product was first used in 1894.
Thomas' is a brand of English muffins and bagels in North America, founded by Samuel Bath Thomas. Today the company is owned by Bimbo Bakeries USA, which also owns the Entenmann's, Boboli, Stroehmann, and Arnold bakeries. [13]
Foster's sourdough English muffins were a popular brand English muffin originally from San Francisco. They were a signature menu item at Foster's restaurants from the 1940s to the 1970s, and continued to be produced as a packaged brand until 2008.
English muffins can be purchased in a wide range of varieties, including whole wheat, multigrain, cinnamon raisin, cranberry, and apple cinnamon.
United Kingdom [ edit ]
English muffins are sold in all British supermarkets and many bakeries and are referred to as simply muffins. U.S.-style muffins may be referred to as American muffins, American-style muffins[14] or sweet muffins for clarity or branding purposes, but most people have no problems distinguishing one from the other and use the same word for both.
Germany [ edit ]
English muffins are also available in most major supermarkets across Germany under the name Toastbrötchen which translates as "toast bun".

An estimated 600 Indigenous people, fishermen, and others from the Xingu River basin have gathered to occupy the construction site of the Belo Monte Dam project in the state of Pará, Brazil.
The protest arrives one day after the second judge from the Regional Federal Tribunal voted against judge Selene Maria de Almeida's landmark decision against the Belo Monte dam.
Judge Selene Maria de Almeida's decision (which is not to be confused with last month's decision by judge Carlos Castro Martins to suspend the construction of the dam) found that the government illegally issued the project's environmental licenses because it failed to properly consult affected Indigenous peoples beforehand. That failure, according to judge Selene Maria de Almeida, is a direct violation of Article 231 of Brazil's Constitution.
“The trial is now tied at one vote in favor, and one vote against,” says International Rivers. “The third and final judge must now give their decision on whether they agree with the lawsuit that claims that tribes were not properly consulted. The trial has been delayed once more, and will reconvene for the final vote. Either way the final vote falls, both sides are ready to appeal the tribunal's decisions to the Supreme Court.”
The protesters, on the other hand, have vowed to continue their protest until the Belo Monte dam project is brought to a decisive end.

Hundreds Occupy Belo Monte Dam Site in Brazilian Amazon
Altamira, Brazil – Hundreds of indigenous leaders, fishermen and riverine people from the Xingu River basin have gathered to occupy the Belo Monte Dam construction site in a peaceful protest to stop its construction in Altamira, located in the state of Pará in the heart of the Brazilian Amazon. They have vowed to permanently occupy the site and are calling on allied organizations and movements to join them.
The Trans-Amazon Highway (BR-230) has been blocked around the Santo Antônio village, where it passes the proposed construction site. Groups are demanding the presence of a Brazilian government high-level official at the site to initiate a new round of negotiations that are transparent, inclusive and respectful of the rights of local people affected by the dam.
“Belo Monte will only succeed if we do nothing about it. We will not be silent. We will shout out loud and we will do it now,” said Juma Xipaia, a local indigenous leader. “We only demand what our Constitution already ensures us: our rights. Our ancestors fought so we could be here now. Many documents and meetings have already transpired and nothing has changed. The machinery continues to arrive to destroy our region.”
The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) of the Organization of American States (OAS) has requested explanation as to why the Brazilian Government did not act to ensure the rights of indigenous peoples affected by the dam, as requested by the IAHCR in April. According to the OAS, the Brazilian Government has an obligation of consulting and informing indigenous peoples who will be affected by the dam prior to construction.
Yesterday, the government of Brazil refused to attend a closed hearing convened by the IAHCR intended to foster dialogue toward resolving conflict and discuss failures in protecting the rights of indigenous peoples threatened by the proposed Belo Monte Dam. Plans for the project ignore international protections such as the right to free, prior and informed consent, and jeopardize the health, livelihood and ancestral lands of thousands of indigenous peoples.
Last Monday, a federal judge in Brazil voted that the environmental licensing of the controversial Belo Monte Dam is illegal given the lack of consultations with affected indigenous communities.

Declaration of the Xingu Alliance against the Belo Monte Dam
“We will not allow the government to establish this dam or other projects affecting the lands, lives and survival of current and future generations of the Xingu Basin”
We, the 700 participants of the seminar “Territories, Environment, and Development in the Amazon: the Fight Against Large Dams in the Xingu Basin;” we, the warriors of the Araweté, Assurini do Pará, Assurini do Tocantins, Kayapó, Kraô, Apinajés, Gavião, Munduruku, Guajajara do Pará, Guajajara do Maranhão, Arara, Xipaya, Xicrin, Juruna, Guarani, Tupinambá, Tembé, Ka'apor, Tupinambá, Tapajós, Arapyun, Maytapeí, Cumaruara, Awa-Guajá and Karajas tribes, representing indigenous peoples threatened by Belo Monte and other hydroelectric dams in the Amazon; we, the fishermen, farmers, and residents of coastal cities, impacted by Belo Monte; we, the students, trade unionists, social leaders and supporters of the struggles of peoples against Belo Monte; we together affirm that we will not allow the government to build this dam or other projects affecting the lands, lives and survival of current and future generations of the Xingu Basin.
During the 25th and 26th October 2011, we met in Altamira to reaffirm our alliance and determination to resist together the project to dam and kill the Xingu River, no matter what weapons nor moral, economic or physical threats are used against us.
During the past decade, the government has returned to developing one of the most nefarious infrastructure projects created by the military dictatorship in the Amazon. During this time, we, who are all Brazilian citizens, were not considered, were not heard, nor were we consulted on the construction of Belo Monte. This is a right protected for us by the Constitution and laws of our country, and by international treaties that protect Brazil's traditional inhabitants, of which our country is a signatory.
Forced out of their land, expelled from the banks of the river by construction machines and suffocated by the dust they raise, the people of the Xingu have been brutalized by the consortium authorized by the government to clear our forests, cocoa plantations, gardens, orchards, gardens and houses on the Xingu River, destroying the river's fauna, usurping our properties in the city and the countryside, raising the cost of living, exploiting workers, and terrorizing our families with the threat of a dark future of misery, violence, drugs and prostitution. And thus the government repeats the errors, the lack of respect, and the violence caused by so many other dams forcibly imposed upon the Amazon and its peoples.
Armed with only our dignity and our rights, and strengthened by our alliance, we here declare that we have formalized a pact to fight against Belo Monte, which makes us stronger than the humiliation imposed on us so far. We have signed a pact that will keep us together until this project is wiped from the map and the history of the Xingu, a river to whom we have a debt of honor, of life, and, if the survival of the Xingu requires it, of bloodshed.
Faced with the government's intransigence in dialogue with us, and with their insistence on disrespecting us, from now on we occupy the construction site of Belo Monte and close access to it from the Trans-Amazon highway. We demand that the government send a representative here to sign a waiver to definitively paralyze all works, and to desist from building the Belo Monte Dam.
Altamira, Pará, Brazil, October 27, 2011
Earlier today we reported on the mysterious failure of the Herald to notice that its front page lead story about supposedly poor ScotRail punctuality figures made a number of serious errors with regard to the facts, most notably confusing the excellent figures for last month with a 12-month rolling average which was significantly worse.
But as we read the rest of the papers, we noticed the oddest thing.
Because every single one that reported the story made the exact same mistake.
It wasn't like it was difficult to spot which period the figures – which were published openly on the ScotRail website – referred to. The word “Annual” was in big purple text right at the top of the table.
And immediately below that the measured criteria were explained even more clearly.
Yet bizarrely, when the Daily Record investigated the story in its prime page 2 politics slot, it missed both of the data stipulations, falsely reporting that 43 of Scotland's 73 terminal stations had missed the PPM target “last month”:
Amazingly, the Courier, which also made the news its front page lead, did the same:
Somehow the paper's political reporter also managed to misread “Annual” and “rolling 12-month average” as “July”. And it just kept getting spookier.
Because the Scottish Daily Mail (page 3) suffered the curious visual impairment too, also attributing the stats to “last month”:
Remarkably, FOUR completely different, independent Scottish political journalists had all inexplicably managed to seriously misunderstand a very straightforward chart in completely identical ways. They hadn't taken it from a newswire – they were all original articles – yet all made the same basic error. And all of their reports featured extensive “SNP BAD” quotes from Scottish Labour list MSP and transport spokesperson Neil Bibby (pictured below pulling their very cleverest expression).
It was almost as if, cynical readers could be forgiven for thinking, Bibby was too dim to understand the table but had written it up anyway as a press release, sent it to all the papers and they'd all rewritten it and published it as their own self-penned truth without even the most cursory of checks to see if it was total thicko cobblers or not.
We're sure there's another explanation, though.
The Atlanta Falcons have a terrible history with the Green Bay Packers, so the enthusiasm is understood. Matt Ryan spoke to the media directly after their game-winning drive.
That was a great team win. Miraculous win. It almost didn't feel real. It's like I didn't even know what audible I was calling. Words just came out of my mouth. Before I knew it, I was heaving the ball down the field. It's almost as if some ancient, omnipotent force was controlling me... [128 second pauses] but that'd be crazy, right?
As Ryan stares off into space, a visibly gaunt Dan Quinn nods. Not in silence, but to the beat of chants coming from the robed Thomas Dimitroff, Arthur Blank, and Rich McKay. They serve the chrome deity. But why? Is it for the team? Or do they fear the giant bird? Quinn has more questions than answers since taking the Atlanta head coaching job.
Wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, instrumental in the last drive, took the stage.
I can barely remember the last drive. I couldn't even tell what Ryan said. It's like they were speaking in tongues or something. I just went out there, ran a route on a play we've never run before, and the ball sank around coverage right into my hands. Now that you mention it, that's a bit... odd. I didn't even think of it. I was more worried about this endless squawking noise I couldn't get out of my end the entire drive.
"Do whatever you have to do to win, Danny," Quinn quietly mumbles to himself. The Falcons are 5-3. They've put together some signature wins and have plenty of breathing room against the rest of the NFC South. If they don't anger the falcon god, they will bring the team to their first playoff berth since 2012.
Was it worth it? Was it worth kicking their friends and coworkers into a lake of fire? They don't have time to think about that now.
"Sandra, could get send Brooks Reed to my office? Thanks."
Quinn tries eating some crackers, but immediately coughs them up. They haven't been able to keep anything down in weeks. He's haunted by this bird.
"Sandra, where is Reed? They should have been here an hour ago." Quinn peers at the Flowery Branch security system only to see Reed shuffling down the hallway in slow motion. He's almost moving backwards. Janitors are blowing past him. Reed stops for four minutes to tie their shoes, then starts checking their phone.
Quinn fears the bird will not wait. They don't have days to present another blood sacrifice. They can't anger the deity on a short week. Not against an NFC South opponent.
"Sandra, call up Rico. Tell them we're going zip-lining." This won't be like any other zip-lining experience he's had before.
"Sorry, Ricardo Allen, but we need fast and physical or else you get fired."
"Did you just use a bad pun?"
Quinn doesn't have time for this. They kick in Ricardo and hopes the bird accepts their sacrifice. At the very least, it will get Allen off the field. That in itself may be good enough to beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Atlanta's 5-3 record is due mostly to Ryan. Their 28/35 for 288 yards and 3 TD stat line is nearly perfect. They were on and got a much-needed 4th quarter comeback to seal out the game.
The Ice Man had another great week even with Julio Jones getting banged up and Tevin Coleman inactive. They put together another great game in their MVP campaign. This was also thanks to Mohamed Sanu's heroics on the last drive. While one of our writers (who knows who it was and why throw blame around here?) said Sanu might be trending toward b*st status, they had the type of game we expected from him.
We present Sanu with the Sanu Canoe, as they helped the Falcons sail away from the Green Bay Packers.
We have to give credit where credit is due. Sanu had a very good game. Speaking of credit, hat tip to @ThatTerenius for being our Photoshop master at the Falcoholic.
Stop me if you've heard this before. The ambitious mayor of a big city backs a project to put a garden on a bridge. A celebrated designer is appointed and seductive images released. It gets compared to the High Line in New York – that urban phenomenon envied as much by rival cities as the Eiffel Tower once was. It provokes controversy.
This much the Skygarden in Seoul has in common with the Garden Bridge in London, but then their stories diverge. Where the London version has foundered, the Korean one will be opened this Saturday by mayor Park Won-soon, a former activist who built their career on opposing both corruption and the conservative establishment, and supporting human rights.
Given the recent turmoil in South Korean politics, in which the former president has been deposed, imprisoned and is awaiting trial on corruption charges, the Skygarden will likely to be a symbol of the alternatives offered by the new president Moon Jae-in, and their ally mayor Park.
There are significant differences in the conception and execution of the two projects. They vary in cost (about £40m for the Skygarden and £200m-plus for the Garden Bridge) and, where the London project has spent many years not happening, the Seoul one has taken two years to take shape since its Dutch architects, MVRDV, were appointed in 2015.
Where the Garden Bridge would have been a cherry on the already rich cake that is the centre of London, the Skygarden aims to regenerate and connect places near the main railway station that have been fragmented by roads and railway tracks. The Skygarden, which will be open to all 24 hours a day, re-uses an existing structure – like the High Line – in the form of a 1970 motorway flyover that was no longer deemed safe for its original purpose.
It is also part of a bigger set of ideas about taking a big, dense – sometimes ugly – city, one which was created without a great deal of concern for public space and pedestrian movement, and giving it qualities of walkability, neighbourliness, human scale and shared enjoyment of its places. To this end, the mayor has encouraged a range of public works and created the post of city architect to help make them happen.
The Skygarden is one of the more eye-catching examples of several initiatives promoted by the first holder of this job, Seung H-Sang, and their successor and ally Young Joon Kim.

Seoul resembles other cities of east Asia such as Tokyo and Shanghai in its scale and rapid postwar expansion, while major western cities such as New York and London also experience comparable pressures of growth. If Seoul gets its programme right, it can set examples for other megacities to learn from. An inaugural Biennale of Architecture and Urbanism will be held this autumn to help get the message across.
South Korea's capital is an ancient city, with a beautiful natural backdrop of mountains, that was devastated in the 20th century by Japanese occupation and the Korean War. It was reconstructed on American-inspired lines, with multilane highways criss-crossing the city. Economic and population growth – it has about 10 million people compared with 1 million in 1950, although the increase has now levelled off – caused the spaces between to be filled in at levels of density that are nearly twice New York's.
It is a business-minded city, its desire for prosperity being sharpened by the traumas and poverty of its recent history, and the need to erect office blocks to serve its economy has usually taken precedence over architectural and urban finesse. The lower levels of buildings tend to be intensely colonised by commercial activity.
At the same time, portions of historic fabric remain – such as the gardens of shrines and palaces and areas of hanoks, traditional houses often built around courtyards. In the crevices and spare spaces of what is a patchwork city, and one whose general shape was not precisely intended by anyone, the current generation of lively and enterprising Korean architects have inserted distinctive individual works. What it hasn't had so much are the sort of interventions in public spaces that a European city like Barcelona has been implementing since the 1980s, or which New York has been pursuing for most of this century.
Seoul's fabric partly reflects the distribution of power in South Korea, where huge conglomerates, or chaebols, tend to take precedence over government. Institutions that in other countries might be provided by the state – art galleries, libraries – are often created by the likes of Samsung and Hyundai. This phenomenon can create some useful and fine buildings, but they often come with strings attached. A vinyl record library, for example, which is a good-looking building paid for by Hyundai Card, comes with special privileges and incentives for cardholders. Another shiny and elegant building, which looks like a contemporary art museum, turns out to be a somewhat preposterous shrine to the Hyundai credit card, where you can see the precious objects being made and exhibits on their history.
The mayor's works programme aims to redress the balance. Their successive chief architects have aimed to make the city more pedestrian-friendly and where possible to adapt the existing fabric rather than erase it in favour of grand new structures. “Revitalisation” rather than “reconstruction” is how Seung H-sang puts it. The city government is also considering the introduction of a congestion charge for the historic centre of the city.

Other projects have included the renovation of Seunsangga (currently under way), a 1km-long 1960s shopping megastructure that became a centre of electronics businesses, built on land that had been cleared as a wartime firebreak. Most cities would have seen at as an eyesore, worn out and in need of total replacement, but Seung recognised that it was now part of the life and tissue of the city. The aim now is to encourage businesses of the fourth industrial revolution – robotics, 3D printing and so on – to move there.
Seung also launched what they call “the most important project in Seoul”, which is the conversion of 424 redundant local administrative offices into neighbourhood uses such as libraries, small theatres, concert halls and cafes. The budgets are small, requiring maximum invention from the usually young architects hired to work on them.
The Skygarden – or Seoul-lo 7017 as it is also called in reference to the dates of the original structure, and of its reincarnation – is both a symbol and an instrument of the shift from car to foot. The original concrete structure has been strengthened, and lifts, stairs and escalators have been added where necessary to connect it to the ground. Bridges also connect to adjoining commercial buildings, who have to pay for the uplift in value. Other uses – cafes, performance spaces, a market – are scattered across the site.

The old bridge and its surroundings are then brought to life by what Winy Maas of MVRDV calls a “library” of 24,000 plants, all indigenous species arranged according to the Korean alphabet. The types of plant then prompt arrangements and uses: pines suggest a forest, and jasmine “has a very obvious relationship to tea gardens”. Ginkos are “hyper bisexual” and arranged in a way that somehow reflects their orientation. Roses “turn out to be very theatrical”, so a theatre is placed among them. When the plants get too big they can be sold and replaced – and Maas says that in this way the library is also a “nursery”.
The hard engineering, which they call “brutal but also nice” is kept grey and neutral “in order to celebrate the richness of the plants”. “Fog machines” and shade will keep people cool in the hot summers.
Maas says that the garden will be “human and friendly and green” in ways that might be thought typical of European city planning, but will also have a “science fiction element” that they see as more Asian. “In Asia they want to dip their cities in this super-green feeling that comes from science fiction, from movies like Avatar,” they say, citing Singapore's spectacular Gardens by the Bay. Their designs bring out the intense colour contrasts of different species, and the Skygarden will be bathed at night in a rich, artificial blue light. It doesn't look – and it doesn't want to be – perfectly natural.
Young Joon Kim, the current city architect who also worked as the coordinator of the Skygarden project, says that they are “very happy”. They acknowledge that not everyone is pleased about handing over road infrastructure to pedestrians – drivers of cars and commercial vehicles, for example – but says that “when you look at things over a longer period it's clear that citizens have to have car-free zones. It's not a kind of taste, it's the way to go, like many other cities.” They acknowledge that some people think that the garden is “too artificial”, but “you cannot copy the natural landscape”, they say.

Young Joon Kim is also delighted with the change of president, not least because national government controls adjoining property such as the railway station and the last administration had been awkward about collaborating.
Minsuk Cho, a Seoul architect, agrees: “It's all great here since the new president Moon and mayor Park have been very close allies, what the mayor has been doing despite the previous oppositional government will, from now on, will get so much more support.”
Mayor Park didn't introduce the idea of public urban interventions – one of their predecessors restored the Cheonggyecheon waterway that had been covered by a highway and another commissioned the bombastic Dongdaemun Design Plaza, designed by Zaha Hadid architects.
What differentiates the Skygarden and its allied projects is their ambition to grow out of the character and needs of contemporary Seoul. For similar reasons the Skygarden promises to be among the more convincing of all the many High Line wannabes in the world. Whether or not MVRDV's designs prove to be too “artificial” huge crowds can be expected, along with global fame. It could be a garden bridge that works.

Howto build a working Alarm/Surveillance device
Below I try to describe how to build a working monitoring unit.
All you need
Power and connection PCB
Make a small PCB to easy power and connect everything to the Raspberry Pi.
I use a small Buck converter to convert to 5V, then i can have higher voltage in the supply lines.
A 5V cable must be pretty short not to get voltage drop, but if you use e.g. 24V then you can use a long power cable to your device.
I use this prototype PCB card. Must cut away a little so that it will fit.
Flip the card and file away like in the second picture. The hole that the arrow points to should not be connected to the hole below. Also solder a jumper like the picture.
prototype Flip back the card and solder jumpers and a ULN2803A.
Observe that there are only 8 pins left on the ULN2803A, the rest is cut away.
Observe that there are only 8 pins left on the ULN2803A, the rest is cut away.
I use a 800mA fuse (depending on the voltage you may have to change this).
Then solder pins and 2 glass fuse holders I use a 800mA fuse (depending on the voltage you may have to change this).

5V .
Use a small screwdriver on the trimpot and a multimeter.
It can be hard to dial in...
Now you must set the voltage on the Buck converter toUse a small screwdriver on the trimpot and a multimeter.It can be hard to dial in...
When you have set the Buck converter to 5V you can solder it to the PCB.
This buck converter is for the IR-lamp.
Depending on the type of IR lamp the voltage varies, i my case 9.9V.
Then solder it ontop of the other buck converter.
Now take a identical buck converter and solder 90° pins to it like this.This buck converter is for the IR-lamp.Depending on the type of IR lamp the voltage varies, i my case 9.9V.Then solder it ontop of the other buck converter.
An then solder on the upper side...
Last step is to flip it and set the raspberry pi connectors on the bottom.An then solder on the upper side...
The finished card IR LED array
Use this
I power the LED with 9.9V
My LED is 1.35V 100mA. And 6 LEDs in serie. Depending on the IR leds and voltage you must use different resistors.Use this calculator I power the LED with 9.9VMy LED is 1.35V 100mA. And 6 LEDs in serie.
That give a resistor of 18 Ω.
And i have 3 of those in parallel, so you need 3 resistors.
skip this and buy: IR 48 LED InfraRed Illumination Light But the easiest is tothis and

Water proof the PCB
Take the PCB and glue a rubber plate
The legs of the LED will pass through the rubber to protect from water.
You can skip this and put it in a box with transparent lid if you want to, it is much more easy, but din not have any box that fit...
on the side without the copper.The legs of the LED will pass through the rubber to protect from water.
Take the PCB and glue a rubber plate Then drill through the rubber where the IR legs is to be.
Use the smallest drill you got.
And then put the IR LEDs through like the picture below.
I have 2 different types of IR LEDs because it was included in the kit I bought.
But they have the same voltage and current.
The long leg is to the left in the first picture and to the right in the second (i flip the bord).

The LEDs will be exposed to the environment, but I think it will work :-)
Also solder the resistors and 2 pins...
Then cut away the part of the PCB you dont need.
If you want to test it apply 9.9V (the side with the resistors is GND). When you solder the LEDs, try to push down on them, then they will be better seal between the LED and rubber.The LEDs will be exposed to the environment, but I think it will work :-)Also solder the resistors and 2 pins...Then cut away the part of the PCB you dont need.
The i glue a simple holder for the PCB
Several coats.
At last i paint the backside and edges with rubber paint to protect from water.Several coats.

With its grand entry hall and massive, ornate great room, this Mercer Island mansion feels a little like a European palace.
You don't need to be royalty to live there, but you do need $26.8 million.
The house, 5330 Butterworth Road, was built in 1996. It is 14,940 square feet, with five bedrooms, 8.5 bathrooms and seven fireplaces -- including a seven-room owner suite -- a billiards room, a bar, a "scone and tearoom," a movie theater, a wine cellar and an elevator. A second kitchen is equipped for five types of cooking.
A fitness pavilion features squash and tennis courts, and a spa. The grounds include dolphin fountains, 80 species of rhododendrons and two docks big enough to accommodate boats larger than 100 feet.
Despite all this, "it's not overwhelming in size," listing agent Wendy Lister, of Coldwell Banker Bain, said. "Some homes, you don't know where you are and where you're going. But this home was really built with comfort and warmth, along with glamour, in mind."
The original owners are selling because they're moving to two different states, Lister said. Click through the gallery above for a virtual tour.

Laurie Crouch is devastated. Them 3 year old pit bull, Gooch, was killed right before their eyes. This was not a savage murder like you hear about pit bulls where the dog was shot, stabbed, tortured or set on fire.
About Gooch
Gooch was Laurie's service dog. Laurie is a 23 year old disabled Michigan woman suffering from multiple sclerosis who depends on a wheelchair for mobility. While Gooch had no formal training as a service dog, they did have a very special bond with Laurie.
They rescued them as a puppy from someone who was going to sell them to a dog fighter. They rewarded them with the love and loyalty only a rescued pup can demonstrate. They happily retrieved things for them and made their everyday life easier.
How Gooch Was Killed
On October 14, 2010, Laurie had a groomer come to their home to trim Gooch's nails. It was not the first time they had hired this groomer. “Something was different that night” said Laurie. “The groomer had a male assistant with them and both acted strangely.”
“I had a bad feeling.”
Laurie told me the groomer's assistant — whom Laurie had never met before — refused to give them their name. As the first nail clipped was below the dog's quick, Gooch started to struggle. The groomer and their assistant put a prong collar on Gooch and wrapped a leash around their muzzle. They lifted up the 65 pound dog by the prong collar in an attempt to make them stop struggling.
At this point Laurie told them to stop; they did not want them to finish the nail clip service. The groomer refused, telling Laurie they came all this way and they intended to finish the job and get paid. At this point both the groomer and assistant were literally sitting on Gooch to make them stop squirming. As they finished clipping their nails, they went limp and died.
By this time, Laurie had thrown themselves off the sofa and dragged themselves to Gooch. The groomers took the $15 fee which Laurie had placed on a nearby table and left. Not even an “I'm sorry” was muttered by either of them.
The necropsy report cited cause of death as suffocation and noted multiple organ hemorrhages, including the brain and liver. Laurie informed me in a telephone conversation that Gooch had bloody foam in their throat when the groomers left them home.
What Happened Next
Laurie's parents were able to write down the license plate number of the vehicle the couple had driven. Once police were called and a report filed, Laurie was informed the license plate number was registered to a different vehicle than the one it was affixed to.
Laurie and their family were initially told there were no charges to be filed and if they wanted restitution, they needed to file a civil suit. An outpouring of love in the form of telephone calls, emails and an offer of a new puppy were given to Laurie.
Rebecca Arnett and Gail Landon run Giggles N' Wiggles, a local puppy rescue organization, and have donated a black lab puppy to Laurie. They will also be paying for the neuter surgery, vaccinations, puppy training and a month's worth of food. Laurie has named the pup Junior in honor of Gooch. Once the little guy is weaned, they will get to live with Laurie.
Police Report
A call put into the Waterford (Michigan) Police Department got me connected to Lawrence Novak, the detective investigating this case. Novak informed me that the case is still under investigation. They have been in touch with Jessica R. Cooper's office — the prosecuting attorney for Oakland County, Michigan. More information was requested by Cooper's office and Novak reports they expect to have a decision sometime next week whether or not the office will prosecute the groomer. The groomer remains unnamed to date because no charges have yet been filed.

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — A group of Republican lawmakers on Tuesday introduced a package of bills to overhaul the troubled government-seized housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including a measure to force the administration to more quickly raise the fee the two firms charge for guaranteeing mortgage securities they sell to investors.
In addition, the group of lawmakers, all members of the House Financial Services Committee, introduced a bill that would limit the pay packages of executives and employees at the two firms, one that would eliminate their affordable housing goals and a provision to expedite an existing White House plan to reduce the size of their trillion-dollar-plus portfolio of mortgages.
The two companies became saddled with toxic mortgages and were nationalized at the peak of the financial crisis in 2008 to avoid losses and stem the credit contagion.
Regulatory observers say that some of the bills have a chance of being approved by the Democratic-controlled Senate while others have little or no chance. It is unclear whether the GOP lawmakers will try to advance the bills one at a time or as a package.
The committee will hold a hearing to examine the legislation on March 31, with a vote on the measures scheduled to take place in the committee on April 5.
Rep. Spencer Bachus, chairperson of the panel, introduced a bill that would suspend pay packages for all employees at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and establish a compensation system that is comparable to other government employees. “Our strategy is the same as it has always been and that is to end government involvement in Fannie and Freddie,” said Bachus at a press conference.
Rep. Randy Neugebauer of Texas would direct Fannie and Freddie's regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, to phase in over two years an increase in the price the two firms charge for guaranteeing mortgage securities they sell to investors. The goal would be to stimulate the dormant private mortgage securities market.
The Obama administration, in a Treasury report last month, said it wants to increase the price of the guarantee fee to private market levels but it has yet to provide any details.
Observers believe that the White House doesn't want to increase the fee until after it can see what happens to the market when another key law allowing the firms to buy mortgages with values as high as $729,750 expires in September. Many observers argue that an immediate increase of the fee could hurt the recovery.
However, Neugebauer insisted that raising the fee would spur the private market. “When people see that there is money to be made, that these are good investments, I believe the marketplace will come back in,” they said.
Scaled-back holdings
Rep. Jeb Hensarling introduced a provision that would speed up efforts to sell the portfolio holdings of Fannie and Freddie. Currently, Fannie and Freddie have roughly $1.4 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and loans on their books. The Texas member of congress wants the portfolios reduced over five years to $250 billion each. The bill, if approved, would expedite an existing requirement that Fannie and Freddie reduce their portfolios by 10% a year.
Jaret Seiberg, analyst at MF Global Inc. in Washington said a speedy unwinding of the portfolios could add an extra $100 billion per year to the MBS market. “The issue is whether there is enough demand for the MBS. If there is not, it could drive up housing finance costs,” they said.
If the price gets cheap enough, I'll buy them. Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Tex.)
However, Hensarling refuted the notion that the markets couldn't handle the portfolio reduction over five years.
“If the price gets cheap enough, I'll buy them,” they told MarketWatch after a press conference. “I think the most unreasonable thing we can do is leave Fannie and Freddie as they are. They never should have had these retained portfolios in the first place and it never did anything to their housing mission. Five years is not an arbitrary number.”
Rep. Judy Biggert (R., Ill.) introduced a bill that would hike oversight over the firms by establishing an Inspector General within FHFA to oversee the companies. Seiberg said it was an idea that Democrats could embrace because “it's hard to be against Inspector Generals.”
Another bill, introduced by Rep. David Schweikert, would prohibit Fannie and Freddie from engaging in new businesses.
“You would hate to wake up one morning and find out that [Fannie and Freddie] have decided to go and do car loan securitizations or credit cards or some other product,” Schweikert said. “We are trying to ensure that we structure the box that they operate within.”
GOP lawmakers at the press conference said they expect to introduce more bills seeking to reform Fannie and Freddie down the road. They declined to provide any details about these additional measures.
Fannie FNMA, -2.85% and Freddie FMCC, -4.06% have long been crucial to the housing market, guaranteeing or owning roughly 50% of the residential mortgage market. Including Federal Housing Administration loans, the government has been responsible for about 95% of mortgage origination between 2008 and 2010.
Senate side
Meanwhile, the housing industry in front of a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Tuesday urged a go-slow approach to winding down mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
“Some continuing and predictable government role is necessary to promote investor confidence and ensure liquidity and stability for homeownership and rental housing,” according to a statement of the common position of banks, realtors and mortgage brokers who are often at odds.
“Changes to the mortgage finance system must be done carefully and over a reasonable transition period to ensure that a reliable mortgage finance system is in place to function effectively in the years ahead,” the trade groups said.
No group has come forward with a long-term solution to replace the mortgage giants. The Treasury Department put forward a plan last month that suggested three options.
At the hearing, Mortgage Bankers Association chairperson Michael Berman said the government should provide “an explicit, but limited, credit guarantee on a class of mortgage-backed securities backed by “core”, well-underwritten single-family and multifamily mortgage products.”
“This guarantee should not be free, but should be financed with risk-based fees to be deposited into an FDIC-type insurance fund,” Berman said.
Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, and Janneke Ratcliffe, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, also backed a limited government role.
While Fannie and Freddie should be phased out, the government should provide “catastrophic insurance” to the sector, Zandi said. If the government also decides to provide subsidies to low-income households, the assistance must be explicit and on-balance-sheet, they said.
“In a fully privatized system, you're not getting rid of risk – you still have catastrophic risk and at the end of the day, the government will step in,” Zandi said.
“It's going to be very difficult for the government not to step in the save the system, and therefore it's better to explicitly price for that service.”
But Arnold Kling, a former economist at Freddie Mac, warned the committee to eliminate government guarantees altogether.
“Any scheme to bring government back in as a player providing a guarantee is the financial equivalent of building a new nuclear power plant right on top of a fault line,” Kling said.
Kling said the secondary mortgage market might not survive the absence of a government guarantee.
“That would not be a disaster for the American people. We might go back to lending like when I was growing up where if you got a mortgage loan, the same bank that lent you the money held on to the mortgage until you finished making the payment,” Kling said.
Kling said the government would make money most of the time under catastrophic insurance program “like picking up nickels in front of a steam roller.”
“And then at some point that steam roller is going to get you,” they said.
Zandi said the 30-year mortgage product would disappear under a fully-privatized system.
Radiant Historia: Perfect Chronology, the remake of the Atlus RPG released in 2010, was launched in Japan today. Within the game's limited edition, a special, 100-page art book contains a developer interview with insight into the game's development.
Plan for PS Vita
Within the interview, director Mitsuru Hirata states that Perfect Chronology was originally planned for “another portable device” development years ago. before its production was suspended for Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE. Once #FE was over with, they decided to resume the development of the remake for Radiant Historia on the 3DS, as it had a much larger userbase than the “other portable platform” in question. With this statement, [email protected] concludes that Hirata is referring to the PlayStation Vita.
The decision to continue production of the remake was thanks to the positive critical reception for the original game that continued about five years after its release, as well as its appreciation overseas. They wanted more people to know of the highly appreciated “Radiant Historia.”
The production of Perfect Chronology started in earnest at the beginning of 2016. Before that, Hirata replayed Radiant Historia to completion, finishing it around the end of 2015.
Eruca's Hair
In a recent 4Gamer interview, director Hirata is asked about the decision to change Princess Eruca's hairstyle, which was originally short.
Hirata wanted to redesign visual aspects of the game, like the characters and the UI, in a way that new customers could pick up. There are many people who liked the original look of the game, so it was an important decision.
In regards to Eruca's new, long hair, Hirata states that they were actually meant to have long hair originally. They were given short hair in the Nintendo DS game to convey a princess with a different hairstyle than one would expect. While Perfect Chronology doesn't represent a “return to origin,” they decided to make Eruca's hair long again to make their depiction as royalty direct, and as “the image of a princess you generally imagine.”

Radiant Historia: Perfect Chronology was released for the 3DS in Japan on June 29, 2017. It will be released in North America and Europe in early 2018.

President Trump and Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) at a luncheon about health care with GOP leadership in the White House State Dinning Room on July 19. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)
Conventional wisdom has it that Senate Democrats, who will have to defend 25 seats, including 10 in states that Trump won in 2016, are likely to lose ground in the 2018 midterms. The numbers alone would make it hard for Republicans not to gain ground, right? Well, as things are playing out, Republicans might make no gains or even lose a seat.
Talk of Democratic Senate losses may be overblown, given how adroitly many red-state Democrats have navigated (so far) through the Trump presidency. Stalwart defense of Medicaid and opposition to an unpopular Republican health-care bill but more conservative votes for Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch allow moderates like Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) and Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) to keep their base intact without getting tagged as “Washington liberals” by GOP opponents.
In some cases, Trump undercut their party's chances of picking up a seat. They selected as their interior secretary former member of congress Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.) and potential Montana challenger to Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.)
Meanwhile, in Alabama, Trump's support for the less kooky Republican candidate, Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.) — who was appointed to fill Jeff Sessions's seat — doesn't seem to have helped. (The governor who appointed Strange, however, was forced to resign in disgrace. ) Gadfly, birther and ex-judge (who was booted off the bench twice, once for putting the Ten Commandments up behind their bench and again for refusing to recognize gay marriage after the Supreme Court ruled otherwise) Roy Moore is leading Strange by almost 20 points in two separate polls. (Even an internal poll shows Strange trailing by 4 points.) Hard as it is to imagine, if Moore wins the primary the GOP might lose the seat, knocking their Senate advantage down to 51-49. (Even with Moore, the GOP would seem to have the advantage.)
And, most egregiously, Trump has made life miserable for both Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), whom they accused of being “weak on borders, weak on crime” at their Arizona rally this week and Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), the most vulnerable Republican, someone who got in Trump's cross hairs over Obamacare's repeal. (He eventually voted for repeal, annoying just about everyone.) Democrats may have able challengers in both races. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) has not formally announced but would be a solid, moderate challenger; in Nevada, Democrats snared their top pick, Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.).
Kyle Kondik, from Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball, comes to the conclusion that this adds up to a status-quo election. that is, no change in the 52-48 split:
Applying the historical averages to next year's Senate elections would result — drumroll please — in a net party change of…zero seats. If 91% of the Democrats/Democratic-caucusing independents are reelected, that would be 23 out of 25, and if 75% of the Republicans are reelected, that would be six of eight, leading to no net change. Without making any predictions, such a scenario is plausible: Democrats could lose two of the incumbents defending dark red states, in states such as Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota and West Virginia, but otherwise hold everything else, while Republicans could lose the only two seemingly vulnerable seats among their much smaller stable of incumbent-held states: Arizona and Nevada.
It's very likely then, that in part because of Trump, Republicans lose both toss-up states (Nevada, Arizona) while Democrats keep their losses to two (Indiana, Missouri). As Kondik observes, “Ask any Senate observer or campaign participant which Democratic senator is most vulnerable and you're likely to get one of two responses: either Sens. Joe Donnelly (D-IN) or Claire McCaskill (D-MO). . . . One potential new vulnerability for Donnelly is a recent Associated Press report that their family's company benefited from low-cost Mexican labor even as Donnelly has argued against outsourcing.” But, of course, if there is a wave election and despondent Republicans stay home, it would not be impossible for the GOP to lose both its most vulnerable senators and Democrats to save one or both of their own.
Protestor Jeff Hulbert of Annapolis, Maryland holds a sign as they demonstrate in favor of a travel ban to stop the spread of the Ebola virus, in front of the White House in Washington October 16, 2014. REUTERS/Jim Bourg
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nearly three-fourths of Americans support a ban on civilian air travel in and out of the West African countries that have experienced an Ebola outbreak, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows, suggesting growing pressure on President Barack Obama over the issue.
Republicans have been clamoring for a broad travel ban as they campaign ahead of November's congressional elections, and in recent days a handful of Obama's fellow Democrats in close Senate races have joined the fray.
New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen on Monday became the latest Democratic candidate to join a slew of Republicans in being open to a ban. The issue has surfaced in close races across the country as Republicans look to wrest control of the U.S. Senate from the Democrats.
More than 70 percent of poll respondents said they would support blocking all civilian travel in and out of those countries, even as experts questioned how useful such measures would be in containing the disease.
The Obama administration on Tuesday said travelers to the United States from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea must fly into one of five airports with advanced screening procedures, but it has so far resisted calls for a broader travel ban.
While Americans are split over whether all exports from the affected West African countries should be blocked, 58 percent said food exports should be stopped.
The online poll of 1,602 people, conducted between Oct. 16 and 21, had a confidence interval - similar to a margin of error - of 2.8 points.

Bathhouses, beaches, community pools, floating pools docked off the East River—you can't say New York hasn't made an effort over the years to keep residents cool on hot summer days.
And for those who couldn't get to a pool, the city brought a pool to them. These were the “swimmobiles,” pools attached to a truck which could be parked on a street all day and conveniently towed away at night.
“‘Swimmobiles' began during the Heckscher administration [1960s-1970s] that literally took pools to the streets to underserved areas,” says the Parks Department website.
A 1976 New York Times article stated that the city owned five mobile pools, which were towed from Randalls Island to different corners of the city. Looks like fun, no?

Yes, the budget speech is over, and I am incensed, so here goes the disclaimer:
If you're not interested in a heartfelt rant this is not for you, leave now, please.
Are you a middle-class salaried Indian? Let me be more clear. Are you one of the billions who spend everyday working routine or not so routine jobs with one hope of transcending multiple levels of middle-class that exist in your country, only to feel neglected and not so important by your government? Well, my friend - you're not alone.
BCCL
For two excruciatingly long years, I have been waiting to give you some good news on a budget day and well, the wait just got longer. Mr Jaitely in their speech - which was to the delight of no one, loaded with Hindi couplets - has almost clearly spelt out that a tax-paying salaried Indian who is not close to lower income groups is of no specific importance to the government.
To sum up the majority of taxes that affect your daily life remains unchanged. And so does the tax brackets, well almost.
The FM had announced the reduction in taxation in one slab - the Rs 2,50,000 to Rs 5,00,000 one - and that gives a uniform respite of Rs 12,500 to anyone earning above 5 lakhs but the question is - is it enough?
Don't Miss 94.6 K SHARES 49.6 K SHARES 64.9 K SHARES 20.1 K SHARES 35.3 K SHARES
Quartz
Maybe it is for the guy on top, but not for me or my generation of millennials, who strive hard to earn more and increase our standard of living!
The whole Indian middle-class was waiting with baited breath for this budget - which was coming up after a tumultuous time where demonetisation literally tested our patience to a point of almost no-return!
There was hope that the government will pass on the supposed benefits that it reaped by putting us through hell to us.
But we were really wrong. The budget was at best mediocre and even disappointing for many of us who were expecting some major relief.
For starters, there is no major clarity on things getting cheaper - cars, mobiles, gadgets. Nothing is clear yet, mobile circuit boards are getting costlier though and so mobiles may get costlier too. Some of my friends are sad that cigarettes and tobacco will be costlier too.
But the main gripe remains that the tax slabs have remained almost the same. Consider this, the FM themselves pointed out that the number of tax-payers in the country makes up less than one percent of the population and the salaried portion of this is even lower. But it's also true that the salaried portion bears the brunt of direct taxation.
Look at the tax slabs, the more you earn and higher you climb up the corporate ladder, more is the percentage of income you pay tax. the rates increase by 10 per cent on each slab and then there are the cess and surcharges.
Shouldn't this be inverted to encourage more people to disclose their real income?
Also, the limit for allowances like transport and medical remain so grossly mismatched. In which Indian city can you commute with a monthly travel allowance of Rs 1,600 - if you drive, take the cab or even a bike? And Rs 15,000 in medical? seriously?
What does Rs 12,500 in exemption mean to someone who earns 9.5 lakhs an annum and who otherwise pays Rs 1,02,500 as income tax?
They can save another 30,000 here but for that they will have to invest Rs 1,50,000 in tax saving instruments which may not yield the best returns (read LIC).
It hurts more because all around expectations were rife about a new -more up to pace with time - kind of tax slabs structure with a revised limit for savings and allowances. It was supposed to be an invitation for all those who avoided tax ambit to join the fray and expand the tax base and ease the pressure off the middle and higher sections of the middle class who were strained the most and who contribute the most in taxes.
But no! The respite was only meant for the lowest strata of middle-class who are closest to the favourite vote bank of the political machinery aka the poor!
So this budget was just like the last one. None of the things you wanted is cheaper, you don't have more avenues to save and your tax savings stands at just Rs 12,500.
What is the point of having great roads by my village, if I can't afford a car and fuel for it to drive from my pot-hole ridden city road to them?
I love my country and would happily contribute, but why am I the only one who is burdened with unfair taxation.
I am already paying vat on all things I buy and service tax on all services I consume - including food!
In the end, I can say that they did try to save me Rs 60 on train tickets by removing service charges on IRCTC bookings but for that I will have to start travelling in trains again which will cost me more in terms of work hours.
Rich farmers are still exempt, while rich folk will flinch but shell out more than punishment for having money in a developing country. And next time you are confused about how important you're to your country remember that at least your govt doesn't give a shit about you!
I had been using Yoda conditions for some time before I stumbled upon this now deleted Stack Overflow Question, later backed up in this blog post. I remember thinking "This could have saved me a lot of time!". Indeed, who can claim they have never written code like this:
<?php if ( $name = 'Luke Skywalker' ) { // this piece of code will always be executed }
So how do Yoda conditions work? Well it is basically a knee-jerk reaction you have to develop: whenever you write a condition, put the operand that cannot be assigned on the left. This should give you an error message if you make an assignment when you actually meant to make a comparison.
In our case, this gives the following:
<?php if ( 'Luke Skywalker' = $name ) { // Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '=' }
and finally, if you go all in and use strict comparison, this:
<?php if ( 'Luke Skywalker' === $name ) { }
In english, this translates to "If Luke Skywalker is the name", which should feel very familiar if you are from Dagobah or whichever planet Yoda actually came from, but is just cognitive load if you are used to english syntax, which you should if you are writing programs.
I believe it has to become a knee-jerk reaction because if it does not, there is no point to it: if you can think of using Yoda conditions, then for sure you can think of checking if you really mean to write an assignment here or not. You have to use them without thinking.
So let us say that you develop the knee-jerk reaction. You might end up with code like this:
<?php if ( 'Luke Skywalker' === $this -> getName ()) { }
Do you see the issue here? Both operands cannot be assigned, so there is no benefit, but the downside is still there.
Soon enough, the disease spreads to inequalities, even in the documentation of my favorite framework, and you end up with needlessly convoluted code like this:
<?php if ( 42 < $force ) { }
There are a few things to ponder before picking Yoda.
First, the only person who benefits from Yoda conditions, is you, the writer. It just makes life slightly harder for the people that read your code, which includes code reviewers, coworkers, or potential contributors.
Also, if you test every code path, you should be able to spot the problem before it reaches the next step of your development pipeline. Tests can help with that, especially if you write them before writing the actual code, in a healthy red-green-refactor cycle
Next, code review (including and especially self code-review) should catch the mistake if tests fail to do that.
And finally, if you are not feeling a strong need for assignments in conditions anyway, you may as well use a static analyzer to enforce a rule that forbids them. If you still would like to be able to use them you can also prevent Yoda conditions and only them.
So go ahead, get rid of Yoda conditions today, and death to the Jedi.

(Editor's note: The video is graphic)
The dash-cam video at the center of the manslaughter trial that recently ended with a not-guilty verdict against the former St. Anthony police officer who shot and killed Philando Castile was released to the public Tuesday.
It shows Jeronimo Yanez drawing their gun seconds after pulling Philando Castile over for a broken taillight last July in Falcon Heights and rapidly firing seven bullets into the 32-year-old black man's car while their girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, and their 4-year-old daughter helplessly watched.
The footage was among several critical pieces of evidence included in the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension investigative file that was made public late Tuesday afternoon.
Also included in the file was audio of BCA agents' interview with Yanez the day after the shooting. The 29-year-old Latino officer's statement was referenced repeatedly by prosecutors throughout their trial as evidence of what they said was the officer's shifting story about what prompted them to fire. The interview in its entirety was never introduced for jurors' consideration.
After nearly 30 hours of deliberation, the jury on Friday found Yanez not guilty of second-degree manslaughter and two counts of dangerous discharge of a firearm.
Some members of the public are still reeling from the verdict, and protests broke out throughout the weekend.
THE DASH-CAM VIDEO
Many community members for months had demanded the dash-cam video, which was withheld as Yanez's case moved through the courts.
With its release Tuesday, members of the public who didn't attend Yanez's trial could finally hear the tone in Castile's voice that Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said had stuck with them when they deliberated over whether to press charges in the case.
“(Castile) was so respectful,” Choi said at a news conference after the verdict was delivered. “… They went beyond what the law requires (of drivers with a permit to carry a firearm). They were compliant. They aren't resisting, and at the end of the day, this was a traffic stop.”
Jurors watched the video multiple times throughout the trial. Taken from the camera mounted on Yanez's squad car's dashboard, the footage doesn't show what happened inside Castile's vehicle, meaning the jury had to decide whose version of events it believed.
From a microphone Yanez wore during the stop, however, jurors could hear Castile's tone of voice when they said to Yanez: “Sir, I have to tell you, I do have a firearm on me,” and how quickly a traffic stop for a broken taillight turned fatal. Castile was initially pulled over because of the taillight, though Yanez also said Castile resembled a suspect in a recent armed robbery.
Yanez said Castile continued to move their hands toward their black pistol despite the officer's orders not to reach for it. They testified that Castile was gripping the gun when Yanez opened fire out of fear for their life. Castile had a permit to carry their handgun but hadn't disclosed that to the officer.
The BCA on Tuesday also released audio of interviews, including those with Yanez and Reynolds, who used their cellphone to live-stream the aftermath of the shooting on Facebook.
Reynolds maintained that their boyfriend was trying to unbuckle their seat belt so they could access their wallet and hand over the driver's license the officer had asked for seconds before the shooting at 9 p.m. July 6.
State prosecutors also emphasized at trial that Yanez's story didn't make sense. Why would someone who just revealed to a police officer that they were carrying a firearm then pull it out to shoot, particularly when their girlfriend and a small child were in the car and all that was on the line was a citation for a broken taillight, they asked several witnesses.
Juror Dennis Ploussard told KARE-TV that the dash-cam video was just one of several pieces of evidence the jury weighed.
Although it is powerful footage, they said the officer's testimony and, most important, the law jurors were asked to apply to the case, ultimately led to the jurors' decision to acquit.
“I mean (we) looked at the prosecution's side, and as far as I was concerned, they didn't prove their case,” Ploussard said.
LAWYERS SAY WATCH CLOSELY
Thomas Kelly, one of Yanez's defense attorneys, asked the public to pay close attention to Yanez when they watch the video, in particular to the portion of the clip when the officer “(reaches) in the car to try to restrain or prevent Mr. Castile from removing their gun.”
“They should be listening for the clear and loud commands that were given to Mr. Castile,” Kelly continued. “… The reactions of officer Yanez (are what) one would expect from an officer who sees a gun being produced after ordering a motorist not to touch a gun and to comply with their commands.”
They added that the FBI enhanced the video's audio, meaning what can be heard by the viewing public is not necessarily what Yanez heard.
Glenda Hatchett, the attorney representing the Castile family, told viewers to trust their own perception when they watch the footage.
“I … simply ask people to look carefully at the dash-cam video and judge for themselves,” Hatchett said.
If they do, the president of Communities United Against Police Brutality said people will be able to plainly see that the jury got it wrong.
“(The video) shows Philando calmly stating that they had a firearm and a few seconds later Yanez panicking and shooting wildly into the car,” Michelle Gross said in a prepared statement. “Nothing in the video indicates that Philando Castile was ever a threat to Ofc. Yanez.”
WHAT YANEZ TOLD INVESTIGATOR
Also released as part of the file was Yanez's interview with BCA agent Doug Henning after the shooting — the interview the jury never got to hear.
During the interview, Yanez initially said they were blocked from seeing where Castile was reaching after Castile told the officer they had a gun.
“It appeared to me that they were wrapping something around their fingers and almost like if I were to put my uh hand around my gun like putting my hand up to the butt of the gun … and then I lost view of it,” Yanez said, according to the BCA's printed transcript of the interview.
During a later portion of the interview, Yanez said, “It was dark inside the vehicle. I was trying to fumble my way through under stress to look and see what it was to make sure uh what I was seeing. But I wasn't given enough time and like I said they had no regard for what I was saying.”
They later said, “… as the rounds were going off I thought they were still moving for their gun and, (sigh) I just seemed like they were pulling out the gun and the barrel just kept coming.”
Henning asked the officer, “It appeared to you, it appeared they had their gun in their hand?”
“… had their gun in their hand,” Yanez replied.
“Okay,” Henning said.

Yanez then told investigators that as they were firing, “I thought I was gonna die and I thought if he's, if they have the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five year old girl and risk their lungs and risk their lives by giving them secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing then what, what care do they give about me. And, I let off the rounds and then after the rounds were off, the little girls (sic) was screaming.”
During testimony on the stand, Yanez stated unequivocally that they saw Castile gripping a gun in theirs hand.
JURORS NEVER HEARD AUDIO OF BCA INTERVIEW
Ramsey County prosecutors did not introduce the BCA interview when they presented their case.
Instead, they attempted to introduce audio of the interview during a cross-examination of Yanez on the stand.
The judge denied the request, questioning their timing. Neither the audio nor the full transcript was ever entered as evidence, though prosecutors read key parts of the transcript when Yanez was on the stand. Related Articles Crash closes I-94 westbound in Minneapolis for ‘extended period of time'

Later, during deliberations, the judge denied jurors's request for a transcript of the interview.
The Ramsey County attorney's office released a statement following the judge's decision, saying they didn't introduce the transcript earlier because they thought the statement would best be used on cross-examination.
“We were still able to introduce their conflicting statements for impeachment purposes, but not in the manner we had planned on, which was to have the defendant listen and respond to questions as it was being played,” the attorney's office said.
Joe Tamburino, a criminal defense attorney in Minneapolis, believes not admitting the BCA statement “was a tactical decision that the prosecutors made and obviously, it seems to me, that that was a mistake.”
On Tuesday, when asked whether not introducing the testimony earlier was a mistake, a Ramsey County attorney's office spokesperson re-released the earlier statement, with an added sentence, saying, “We believed that our cross-examination addressed all of the relevant conflicting statements that the defendant made during their BCA interview and therefore did not call a rebuttal witness.”
Tamburino said they believed the judge's decision was “totally proper” because new evidence cannot be introduced when a jury is deliberating.
LAWSUITS AHEAD
With the criminal trial behind them, the Castile family now plans to file a civil lawsuit against Yanez.
Reynolds plans to review the evidence released Tuesday before deciding whether to file their own suit, according to their attorney.
St. Anthony moved immediately after the verdict to dismiss Yanez from its police force.

Blind Auditions and Moral Myopia
The gender/racial ideologies of the Vienna Philharmonic and the employment practices that allow them to continue.)
by William Osborne
Three years ago, in response to massive international protest organized by the International Alliance for Women In Music, the Vienna Philharmonic/Vienna State Opera Orchestra announced that it would allow membership to women. To deflect the protests, the orchestra immediately gave their affiliate 2nd harpist, Anna Lelkes, an official position. Since then the orchestra has hired only one other woman, who is also a harpist. Them contract begins in the year 2000, and after three years they will be eligible for membership in the Vienna Philharmonic. Since the VPO/Staatsoper has always used women harpists, their employment does not represent a change in the orchestra's discriminatory employment policies.
This was confirmed a year after Lelkes' appointment, when _The Los Angeles Times_ revealed that the orchestra had prevented a highly qualified woman from the Berlin Philharmonic, Gertrude Rossbacher, from even auditioning for an open viola position[1]. With their elite professional experience, they would have been an excellent candidate, especially since they were born in Vienna and trained at the Wiener Hochschule fuer Musik. It might thus be useful to examine the the gender and racial ideologies of the Vienna Philharmonic, and the employment practices that allow their continuance.
The Philharmonic's auditions are held in three rounds. In the first two the musician plays behind a screen, but in the third it is removed. This allows the physiognomy of the applicant to be evaluated to make sure it matches the orchestra's ideology that gender and ethnic uniformity give it aesthetic superiority. After the Second World War the Philharmonic instituted blind auditions, but they were soon eliminated. In their memoirs,
Otto Strasser, a former Chairman of the Philharmonic, described the problems blind auditions caused:
"I hold it for incorrect that today the applicants play behind a screen; an arrangement that was brought in after the Second World War in order to assure objective judgments. I continuously fought against it, especially after I became Chairman of the Philharmonic, because I am convinced that to the artist also belongs the person, that one must not only hear, but also see, in order to judge them in their entire personality. [...] Even a grotesque situation that played itself out after my retirement, was not able to change the situation. An applicant qualified themselves as the best, and as the screen was raised, there stood a Japanese before the stunned jury. They are, however, not engaged, because their face did not fit with the 'Pizzicato-Polka' of the New Year's Concert."[2]
The orchestra feels "that to the artist also belongs the person", and that the individual's accomplishment, and -marketability-, are determined by race and gender. They thus changed their auditions procedures so that the applicant could be seen for the final round. They also require a photo with the job application. The desire to "assure objective judgments" was set aside to maintain a special form of orchestral uniformity. The orchestra feels that people who are visibly of other races would destroy the ensemble's image of Austrian authenticity. Not coincidentally, the Vienna Philharmonic is the only major orchestra in the world without a single non-white member.
Many members of the Philharmonic have explained why they feel this gender and racial uniformity is necessary. In an interview with NPR, Hans Novak (a former 2nd violinist with the orchestra) said women destroy orchestral unity because they cause intrigues: "... you can have people falling in love with each other and all kind of jealousies."[3] Another second violinist, Helmut Zehetner, also feels the Vienna Philharmonic has a special
"emotional unity" as an all-male ensemble. They were asked about the possible entry of women into the orchestra:
"No, truthfully said, I wouldn't be indifferent. I would have an uneasy feeling in the situation. And that is because we would be gambling with the emotional unity that this organism currently has. My worry is that it wouldbe a step that could never be taken back."[4]
And concerning the woman harpists, they added:
"... my personal experience is that this instrument is so far at the edge of the orchestra that it doesn't disturb our emotional unity, the unity I would strongly feel, for example, when the orchestra starts really cooking with a Mahler Symphony. There, I sense very strongly and simply that only men sit around me. And as I said, I would not want to gamble with this unity."[5]
This "emotional unity" is maintained by auditions which allow the male musicians to start "cooking" without women around. Dieter Flury, the orchestra's solo-flutist, agrees with Zehetner, and adds that ethnic uniformity is also essential:
"From the beginning we have spoken of the special Viennese qualities, of the way music is made here. The way we make music here is not only a technical ability, but also something that has a lot to do with the soul. The soul does not let itself be separated from the cultural roots that we have here in central Europe. And it also doesn't allow itself to be separated from gender. So if one thinks that the world should function by quota regulations, then it is naturally irritating that we are a group of white skinned male musicians, that perform exclusively the music of white
skinned male composers. It is a racist and sexist irritation. I believe one must put it that way. If one establishes superficial egalitarianism, one will lose something very significant. Therefore, I am convinced that it is worthwhile to accept this racist and sexist irritation, because something produced by a superficial understanding of human rights would not have the same standards."[6]
The belief that racial minorities would damage the orchestra's -image- as an authentic representative of Austrian culture is shared by some other Austrian orchestras, and has been documented by Dr. Elena Ostleitner, a Professor at the Institute for Music Sociology of the Wiener Musik Hochschule fuer Musik. They recorded the following statement by an Asian woman:
"I auditioned for an orchestra, and I led in the point tabulations as long as I played behind a screen. Due to my name it was not apparent that I am an Asian. But when the screen was removed [for the final round], I was rejected without comment. Friends in the orchestra confirmed my assumption. They do not take foreigners, and if they do, then only those in which [foreign appearance] is not visible."[7]
The purpose of the visual criteria in the final round is clear. Another Viennese sociologist, Prof. Roland Girtler, of the University of Vienna, has made similar observations:
"What I have noticed that is interesting, is that the Vienna Philharmonic would also never take a Japanese or such. If they took one, this also would somehow by appearances put in question the noble character of Viennese culture. But this is not racist!"[8]
It is not merely musical performance, but also the racial physiognomy of Asians that is the critical issue--though Girtler does not view this as racist. Similar beliefs were reported in a radio broadcast of the Austria National Broadcasting Corporation. A public school teacher who had taken their class to a rehearsal of the Vienna Philharmonic reported that a girl in the class asked why only men were in the orchestra. Werner Resel, the orchestra's chairperson at the time, answered that the "Vienna Philharmonic is an orchestra of white men playing music by white men for white people".[9]
This policy is problematic, since almost half of the students at the Wiener Musik Hochschule are foreigners, and a large number of them are Asian. Many of them marry Austrians and become permanent residents of the country.
Wolfgang Schuster, a percussionist in the orchestra, also believes that music has special qualities determined by gender: "Many musicians, even if they won't admit it, secretly believe there's a difference in the sound produced by a man and a woman. I know three conductors who say this."[10] It's not necessarily an inferior sound, Schuster says, just different. They also speak of male musicians that have a feminine sound, lacking the attack and strength that the orchestra wants: "I know a lot of men that sound like women. But not with us, mind you. [...] This is something that we label our personal style. And it is, if you want to characterize it, masculine."[11]
The orchestra thus feels that all women and some men lack the requisite virility to play
in the Vienna Philharmonic. Ironically, among the world's major orchestras, the Vienna Philharmonic has one of the most soft, mellow sounds, and one of the most rhythmically elastic styles—characteristics generally coded as feminine.
On January 16, 1997, in response to the IAWM's protests, the Director of the Vienna State Opera, Ioan Holander, said they would force the orchestra to allow women to audition, but in an interview with the Austrian State Television, they insisted that women are not appropriate for some of the more "masculine" instruments:
"There are, indeed, differences that nature has made between man and woman.
Naturally, these differences have an effect on instrumental performance. Naturally, there are different lung constellations between men and women, and naturally there are different mouth constructions, and naturally there are different lips between men and women. And for certain instruments, women are less appropriate than men. That is a fact."[12]
These differences would presumably be noticeable behind a screen, but the Vienna State Opera, which is owned and operated by the Austrian Federal Government, refuses to use blind auditions, and even requires a photo with the applications.
Dr. Elena Ostleitner has been fighting these attitudes for 20 years.  They are a Professor at the Institute for Music Sociology at the Wiener Hochschule fuer Musik, and has led a campaign to end the Philharmonic's ban on women. They say: "It's ridiculous to think there's any difference in the musical performances of women and men. It's not true, it's absolutely not true, and I'm sure if a woman is playing behind a curtain they won't
notice it, you cannot hear it, it's impossible."[13]
Shortly after the Vienna Philharmonic said it had changed its policies, they correctly predicted that the first women auditioning would still encounter prejudice from the male judges: "After the first listening in the audition behind the curtain, they will be in front of a curtain. And then they will say 'yes they played very well, but the man was better because the sound is different.' That will happen."[14]
Since only women harpists have been employed in the three years since the orchestra stated that its doors are open to women, Prof. Ostleitner's suspicions seem to be well founded.
Until recently, these problems also existed in the United States. Prof. Claudia Goldin (a Harvard Economist) and Princeton's Cecilia Rouse recently completed a study of blind auditions in symphony orchestras in the USA. They found that the use of a screen increased the chances of US women in the first round of auditions by 50%, and in the final rounds by 300%. The overall effect of blind auditions has increased the presence of women in US orchestras over the last 20 years from about a 5% representation to 36%.
It is thus notable that the Vienna Philharmonic refuses to hold blind auditions, even though it claims to have changed its ideologies.
In the music magazine _Strad_, Rainer Kuchl, a former concertmaster of the Vienna Philharmonic, reveals how deeply embedded the orchestra's ideologies are:
"Our goal has always been to employ people from regions where we have the same 'feeling'. Nowadays new orchestras are formed with players from totally different backgrounds, all stirred together in the same pot and all with a totally different concept of tone. Then all they have to do is play with precision and that's the current idea of a good orchestra. There's a lot more to it than that."[15]
And _Strad_ asked: "So are all their players Austrian men? Are there no Czechs, Slovaks or other central Europeans, perhaps those who have studied in Vienna?" Kuckl responded: "We don't need such players. They might play like gods but they wouldn't fit in."[16]
In the case of the most qualified women, even the removal of the screen is not a sufficient safeguard to protect the unity of "feeling" Kuchl describes. Some women are so much better than their male competition, that their exclusion would be scandalously obvious if they were allowed to audition. This was illustrated by the violist Gertrude Rossbacher. Never mind that they play like a god, and was born and educated in Vienna. Gender and racial purity are still the ruling deities in the Vienna Philharmonic.

One of my favourite cheap eateries in Chiang Mai is the humble Pun Pun Organic Restaurant , nestled behind Suan Dok Temple. The place is much more affordable than the nearby Nimmanheiman restaurants, and. The food seems to take a lot of inspiration from Thailand's neighbouring countries, while even the, which is a more than a welcome change. The menu is the length of a short story which makes it a very good place to bring friends or visitors to Chiang Mai, to share some new tastes and perhaps some old ones that might be more rare in local restaurants (like Chai tea or avocado). Scroll down to see photos of the food we could barely finish, the endless menu, and a map of the location.
November 26th, 2017
Bringing you the best Lisk news of the week! Keep up to date with the Lisk blockchain platform in a few minutes read.
LiskHQ Berlin Meetup
This week it was time for the much anticipated LiskHQ meetup at the WeWork Sony Center (Germany). In the days and even weeks before the meetup everybody seemed to have different expectations, but one thing was for sure, we would finally get the date of the relaunch/rebranding. Lisk.support was represented by delegate Joo5ty who attended the meetup together with delegate 5an1ty and Elum, who you can all recognize by their cool Lisk.support T-shirts. The meetup started off with Thomas Schouten, the Lisk marketing lead, welcoming everyone to the meetup and thanking the Lisk community for it's tremendous support. After this, Thomas started off with a short introduction on what Lisk is and what Lisk's mission statement is : In a world where only developers with a very special profile can create blockchain applications, Lisk provides access, support and inspiration in the form of great tools to anyone who wants to realize the opportunity of blockchain technology. They then went over the current assets Lisk is holding, which are at the moment around $186 million. Of this $186 million, 48% is held in the LSK token, showing the team's confidence in it's own project.
After this, Lisk marketing manager, Lindsay Buescher, took the stage. They started off by going over some of the community milestones Lisk has reached. These milestones include having almost 80.000 followers on Twitter, being a trending subreddit, and a trending project on Github. After this, Lindsay thanked some important community Github contributors and gave shoutouts to Lisk.support, as well as delegate Stellardynamic, who is doing amazing work for Lisk in the USA. They then talked about how people can contribute to the Lisk ecosystem, the updates on the Lisk ambassador program, and the new Lisk community roadmap, which will be released in the near future. After this, Thomas again took the stage to talk about Lisk getting listed on Binance, (but more on this later in this post) the Lisk ecosystem and Lisk city, which lisk.support team member Jaapjan wrote a great blogpost explaining in a easy way how it will work. The meetup then continued with full-stack developer Tobias Schwarz explaining how Lisk JS works and its future plans for the new year. After a small break, Thomas announced full-stack developer Will Clarck, who took to stage to explain Lisky, the Lisk command line tool and a important piece of the SDK (software development kit) toolbox. Now the time had come where everyone had been waiting for Max Kordek to take the stage. Max started off by thanking the attendees, the people watching via the livestream, and also the Lisk team. They then talked about the promise Lisk made in the beginning of 2016, to be a secure, useable, and excisable blockchain application for everyone in the world. Lisk wants the best user experience in the space to make a change and to get people into blockchain technology. Max then continued by talking about the Lisk Core roadmap, the development roadmap (more on this later in this post) and the release of Lisk Core 1.0 at the end of this year. After which, they moved on to the SDK (software development kit) and explained that the SDK will not be just one tool but a collection of many great tools, a sort of toolbox to help developers build on Lisk. Max then went on to explaining the Lisk desktop/web app, custom tokens, and the decentralized exchange. The decentralized exchange will be a place where everyone will be able to buy into the many tokens that are going to be created though sidechain projects in the future. It was now time for the part that most people had tuned in for, the Lisk relaunch/rebranding. Max started off with announcing the discontinuing of Lisk Nano and Explorer. Instead of having them as two separate things, they will in the future be merged in the Lisk desktop/web app, a totally new Lisk product. Then the relaunch/rebranding date was finally announced to be the 20th of February 2018, which for many people came as a bit of a disappointment. Luckily, Max immediately started explaining why the relaunch/rebranding had been delayed. Lisk wants the best quality, and if something is not as good as the team wants it to be they would rather start over then deliver something not up to standards. They then told more about the relaunch on the 20th of February, which will be a big event comparable to a apple keynote. Max finished off the meetup by going over the development roadmap one more time and explaining that Lisk will have it's own science team and is also planning on hiring many new people in 2018.
Lisk on Binance
This week the Chinese exchange Binance announced the listing of Lisk. The following trading pairs are available – LSK/BTC, LSK/ETH and LSK/BNB. The last pair is the possibility to trade LSK for Binance Coin (BNB), the sites very own token. Binance is a very young exchange that has only been running for 4 months, but already is in the top 10 of cryptocurrency exchanges. The exchange started with a successful ICO (initial coin offering) back in June of this year, and now already offers over 70 BTC trading pairs. They are in 180 countries and have over 600.000 users. The unique feature of Binance is that they offer a 50% deduction of the trading fee if you choose to trade using their BNB token. The CEO of Binance said the following about Lisk : “We like the strategic approach of Lisk's result-driven team and growing community. We believe the collective efforts of focused projects like this are necessary to move the blockchain industry forward”.
The New Development Roadmap
During the LiskHQ meetup the new development roadmap was presented and explained to the Lisk community. On this roadmap we can see that by the end of this year the highly anticipated Lisk Core version 1.0 will be released, as well as the creation of Lisk's very own science team. Some other big releases that will still happen this year will be the releases of Lisk JS 1.0 and Lisky 1.0, followed by versions 1.1 and 2.0 in the next year. As mentioned before, Lisk Nano and Lisk explorer will be discontinued in the new year and replaced by the Lisk desktop/web app. In the next three months, the team will of course also focus on putting the finishing touches on the Lisk relaunch/rebranding event. Another major event on the roadmap is the new fee and address system. At the moment, many people notice that the fees (0.1 LSK) for transferring LSK are already getting high dollar wise. This will be changed in the first quarter of 2018. In the new year Lisk will continue to hire more people to join the team. At the moment, Lisk is looking for 2 frontend QA, 2 frontend developers, 1 backend QA, 5 backend developers, 1 software architect, and 1 project manager. In the first half of 2018, Lisk will also expand the new science team to a total of 5 people. As you can see, it is no wonder that Lisk will be moving into a bigger office space soon. In about a half years time from now Lisk will start having custom tokens and give people the opportunity to register a dApp. At this time, the team will also be working on the blockchain application's platform as well as dApp management. At the end of 2018, the decentralized exchange will be released and people will be able to withdraw/deposit from or to a sidechain.
Lisk Relaunch/Rebranding
After the relaunch date (the 20th of February) was announced, Thomas took the stage to talk about how and where the relaunch event will take place. The Relaunch event will be held in Berlin at the Old Mint, which was an old coin manufacturer. The location is big enough to host 200 to 300 people, but my guess is that the event will be maxed out not long after the signup page is opened. During the event the Lisk community will hear all the details of the relaunch process from the Lisk team and it's partnering agencies. And of course, the team will showcase the improved platform, new brand identity, and website. For those who can not make it to Berlin that evening there will of course be another youtube livestream so that you do not have to miss out on anything.
LiskHQ Berlin Meetup – Livestream
The LiskHQ Meetup can also be watched live on youtube. Two hours prior to the event, the youtube channel already had 400 people waiting for the meetup to start. This number kept on growing and growing and once the meetup was on there where over 5500 people tuned in. It was very exciting to see this amount of people showing interest and support for Lisk. If I remember correctly, the last LiskHQ meetup had “only” 350 people watching at it's peak. What also stood out compared to the meetup in June was the quality of the livestream. This is because the team hired a professional video crew to record the meetup. I would say LiskHQ is on the right path because in just 4 months time the amount of livestream viewers went up 15 times and the visual and audio increased to a professional level of quality. This just shows how fast the Lisk community is growing and how the Lisk team is trying to do whatever they can to keep up with the growing demand.
LiskHQ Berlin Meetup – Review
After the announcement that the relaunch will take three more months, the price of the LSK token started to drop by almost 20% of it's value in a hour. In the days that followed there where also a lot of posts on the Lisk subreddit in which people expressed their disappointment after the LiskHQ meetup. But there also was a lot of positive feedback, one of which was a good review video on youtube called : Lisk Rebranding Announcement – Why is Lisk's price falling?? In this video “The Coin Whisperer” explains why the price of LSK took a sudden fall after the meetup and what the positive parts where that some people might have overlooked. So if you have any doubts about Lisk after the meetup, make sure you watch this video and then see if you still think the same about it.
Lisk.support
This week Lisk.support team member Leon released the next part of their series called : Planning to build a Dapp on Lisk. This part is all about “Competition Comparisons & Target Audience” In this edition Leon talks about points to think about when facing competition from other projects and who is your target audience. Leon uses a nice example of three crypto projects that are in the same market but still have some major differences in how they do things. This week we had another blog post release, this time by team member Jaapjan. After the LiskHQ meetup they wrote an excellent post called “Lisk city : the Lisk ecosystem explained“. In this post Jaapjan uses some easy to understand examples to further explain the Lisk ecosystem that Thomas Schouten talked about during the Berlin meetup.
Let us know what you think about this weeks Lisk news roundup in the comments below!

Attorney General Eric Holder should resign for their role in the James Rosen case. They signed off on a search warrant to Rosen, a Fox News reporter. This warrant treated Rosen as a common criminal. It sets a terrible precedent. Holder should resign to erase this precedent.
Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, a State Department adviser, had leaked to Rosen information about North Korea's nuclear plans. The Justice Department sought the source of this leak by obtaining a search warrant for Rosen's emails and other records. Fox News believes the search warrant even sought records from Rosen's parents, who live in Staten Island, New York.
The basis for obtaining the warrant was that Rosen had conspired with Kim to violate the Espionage Act. That act does not apply to Rosen. It does however, in the government's view, apply to Kim. It should be clear to anyone that Holder has run an end run around the Espionage Act by their actions. While Rosen is not subject to the Espionage Act, Kim is. But Rosen might as well be subject to the act if they can be held responsible for Kim's actions.
The reason the Espionage Act does not apply to Rosen is that it does not apply to those who publish (or broadcast) information leaked to them. In the Pentagon papers case, the government asserted initially the Espionage Act did apply to The New York Times, the paper that published parts of the Vietnam archives leaked to it by Daniel Ellsberg.
When, however, the Times proved to the district court Judge Murray Gurfein that the word “publish” had intentionally been left out of the act, Gurfein concluded that the act was inapplicable. Thereafter, the government dropped its use of the Espionage Act, and it never appeared in its case again—even at the Supreme Court.
In its affidavit for a search warrant, the government asserted that Rosen had cajoled Kim into violating the act by trying to get Kim's story out of him. Any reporter will quickly recognize that Rosen's efforts are customary news-gathering practices used by all reporters. News does not come over the transom; reporters have to work hard to get it.
The government has now put itself in the position of setting standards for what reporters can and cannot do when they talk to those who have access to classified information. If a reporter steps over the line drawn by the Justice Department, they or they may become a criminal. In short, the government has criminalized the news-gathering process.
Holder's actions should come as no surprise to those who have been following them closely. Rosen is not the only journalist Holder thinks is a criminal.  They are also pursuing Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks. Pfc. Bradley Manning leaked classified information to Assange.
While little noticed, a grand jury was empanelled to indict Assange in 2010, initially seeking charges under the Espionage Act. Holder however, later announced “there were problems” with using the Espionage Act for this purpose. Presumably Holder's problem was that the Espionage Act did not apply to the publication by Assange of Manning's leaked information on Assange's website.
Thereafter, Justice Department officials let it be known that the grand jury was proceeding on a theory that Assange conspired with Manning to leak to Assange. Assange had also made the leaked information available to Der Spiegel, Le Monde, El País, and The Guardian. Later The Guardian shared this information with The New York Times, and all of them published parts of the leaked information, as did Assange on their website.
In December 2010, when the Committee to Protect Journalists learned that Holder had switched to a conspiracy theory, it wrote a letter to President Obama not to prosecute Assange, because such prosecution would criminalize news gathering. The committee pointed out to Obama that Assange was a journalist protected under the First Amendment and should not be treated as a co-conspirator. But little did the Committee to Protect Journalists know that Holder had used the conspiracy theory seven months before in May 2010, when they approved the use of the search warrant for Rosen's records.
As far as anyone can tell, this grand jury is still alive. Assange's lawyers believe it has already secretly indicted him. They think that as soon as Assange leaves the Ecuadoran Embassy where they are holed up, they will be faced with the indictment in the U.S. for conspiring with Manning.
Asking courts to treat journalists as criminals under the Espionage Act has only been asserted once before Holder started using it. President Richard M. Nixon used it against New York Times reporter Neil Sheehan, who obtained the Vietnam archives from Daniel Ellsberg. Following the Pentagon papers case, Nixon convened a grand jury to indict Sheehan for conspiring to cause the leak of the Pentagon papers. Nixon failed in this effort, and the grand jury disbanded after 17 months.
The difference between Nixon and Holder is that Nixon failed in their effort to treat Sheehan as a co-conspirator. Nixon therefore could not create the precedent that reporters could be treated as criminals. Holder has. They should resign.

When something changes from one week to the next for no apparent reason, it sparks some curiosity, as is the case with the B.C. finance ministry's “Keeping taxes low for B.C. families” fact sheet posted to its website only a week after the provincial budget.
It favours spin right from the top. The first two lines, classic.
“B.C. families generally have one of the lowest overall tax burdens in Canada including income taxes, consumption taxes, property taxes, health care premiums and payroll taxes.”
In certain circles that's called the bait.
The second: “B.C. currently has the lowest provincial personal income taxes in Canada for individuals earning up to $122,000 a year.”
And that's called the switch.
It goes on to boast that “a single individual can earn more than $19,000 before paying provincial income taxes.” Bet that line wasn't written by someone earning $19,000.
An average two-bedroom apartment rents for $1,571 a month in Vancouver. Presuming someone earning $19,000 a year chose to share an apartment their annual rent would be $9,426, leaving them about $182 a week for incidentals such as federal source deductions, utilities, clothes, transportation and food.
And the ministry has the chutzpah to brag about not charging income taxes on a salary of $19,000.
What really jumps out? The four spanking new illustrations. The ones which point out that an individual earning $20,000 a year pays $693 less in provincial income taxes than they did in 2001, a senior couple earning $40,000 pays $774 less, an individual earning $50,000 pays $1,334 less, and a family of four earning $70,000 a year pays $2,027 less.
It's puzzling why the ministry felt there was a need to come up with new ones, since they tabled six perfectly good scenarios the week before with the budget.
Perhaps the new ones paint a rosier picture? Or maybe it's because they don't come with those pesky numbers from other provinces where folk might notice that British Columbians pay taxes that aren't levied elsewhere?
It also makes one wonder what the numbers might look like if the goalposts were moved ever so slightly and the starting point was, say, 2002 and not 2001 (a year undoubtedly chosen out of thin air) and used the budget scenarios instead.
There can't be any harm in comparing trends with other provinces, can there? Just as no man is an island, no province is a fiscal island, except P.E.I. but that's more happenstance.
In two of the budget's six scenarios, total provincial taxes went up between 2002 and 2014: by $717 for a two-income family of four earning $90,000 and $276 for a two-income family earning $60,000.
An individual earning $25,000 saw their taxes drop, as they would have in every province. B.C. lost ground, dropping to third lowest among the provinces.
A two-income family earning $30,000 saw their taxes fall by 7.6 percent. They fell in six other provinces too, including by 39.9 percent in Alberta and 44.6 percent in Ontario. B.C. lost ground again, going from second lowest to fourth.
For an individual earning $80,000—or nearly $50,000 more than the median income for an individual in B.C.—their taxes dropped by 14 percent. B.C. picked up ground, rising from second lowest to lowest.
And it can't hurt to take a peek at how B.C. stacks up in another province's analysis, strictly as a check on political self-interest.
The Saskatchewan government has its annual intercity comparison of taxes that looks at one city from each province. Figures are readily available online from 2008 on.
An individual earning $25,000 saw their taxes drop in all ten cities between 2008 and 2014. In Vancouver by $301. In the other nine? By an average of $523.
For a family earning $50,000, taxes dropped in seven cities and rose in three. Vancouver had the highest increase of the three. A family earning $75,000, saw their taxes drop in seven cities. Vancouver? Second highest increase.
B.C. may very well have some of the lowest personal income tax rates in Canada, but that doesn't mean the lowest tax bill. So doing that “lowest personal income tax” thing is a cute trick, but at the end of the day it's a trick. And not a particularly empathetic one.

What a difference a year makes.
At this point in 2016, Square Enix Collective hadn't even done its first show, let alone published a game.
Now it has released two, has plans to launch seven more, and has just signed arguably its most high-profile title in the form of World War II multiplayer shooter Battalion 1944 from Bulkhead Interactive - which marks the second time the UK developer has teamed up with the firm.
"We are making big steps forward," says Phil Elliott, director of community and indie development at Square Enix - and the man behind Square Enix Collective.
"Battalion 1944 is, for us, a good sign of health in a couple of ways. The most obvious is that we are working once again with the Bulkhead team. We helped them release Turing Test last year on PC. The Turing Test for them was their second game, it was a little more high profile and the quality was great - Steam user reviews were very positive. Of course, when a developer does a great job, they start attracting the attention of other publishers. I know they spoke to other publishers, there was a lot of interest in the game. So it is very reassuring to me that, in the end, they decided to work with us again and put their trust in us once more. There was every chance they could go elsewhere.
"I would always encourage developers to speak to other publishers. Always get three quotes. It is a bit like your double glazing"
They continue: "I would always encourage developers to make sure that they are having multiple conversations. Always get three quotes. It is a bit like your double glazing. I'd always suggest indie developers see what is available and make the best choice for them. So I am humbled that they considered us still the best opportunity for them.
"Another reason this is important is because, in terms of scale, it is a bigger game. The games we have released so far in Goetia and The Turing Test were certainly of a particular size."
Elliott is clearly a fan of Bulkhead's strategy of developing one game with an eye over what comes next. They say Battalion was the title that the team has always been working towards making.
"It doesn't sound sexy, and it isn't exactly inspirational, but I feel the first priority for every new team is to make enough money to make a second game... and not get carried away with what the big indie sensations have managed," they advise. "The chances of being able to replicate a Mike Bithell or a Jonathan Blow - the first generation indie superstars - are very small. Partly because standards have increased, expectations have been increased and the amount of noise has increased - there is so much out there. But if you keep making games, then you will increase your chances. The more you create, the chances of breaking through and growing your business - and therefore your profile and opportunity - is going to go up over time.
"Bulkhead is a good example. Its first game was Pneuma on Xbox, which gained them some experience and did enough for them to make The Turing Test, which they took to Kickstarter successfully. And now they're onto Battalion. Its business mentality is: 'what is the next thing?' 'How is that going to sustain us and enable us to make the thing after that?' I very much respect that approach."
"I feel the first priority for every new team is to make enough money to make a second game.
Square Enix Collective is an unusual initiative. Effectively a start-up within the wider Square Enix organisation, its existence seems to have little commercial value to the Tomb Raider publisher. The team initially promotes people's games via its website, highlighting upcoming indie projects from a variety of developers and showing them off to the Square Enix community. All for free.
Occasionally, Collective will support these games' Kickstarter campaigns - offering PR, marketing and will also do a 'due diligence' job on the studio so that backers can be more confident that the campaign they're backing will reach completion. For successful campaigns, Collective take a 5% cut of the revenue (after fees), but that's it. Developers have no requirement to work with the company afterwards.
Of course, some developers do - as Bulkhead have done twice now - and Collective offers all the publishing services that you've come to expect - including additional investment (although the investment pots are all used up at the moment).
Yet there's no guarantee a developer will want to work with the firm. So it makes you wonder what exactly is in it for Square Enix?
"Square Enix and Collective are not charities," Elliott explains. "We do need to make sure we are being respectful of the opportunity that we have been given. The way the agreements is set up, it's not super hard for us to break even on a project, but it's not easy to make significant profits, either.
"If profit is what we were having to chase, then Collective wouldn't have a particularly strong reason to exist. We want to build relationships, we want to learn and we want to keep our finger of the pulse of what is happening. I think we are doing that.
"Collective has a scale. This year we are looking at games where the budgets might be $1m, but in the future - perhaps by 2020 - we might be working on projects that are closer to $3m - $5m.
"For us it is a bit nebulous to say there is a bottom line number we are working on. We want to make sure we are not costing Square Enix money, and 2017 will be the year where we aim to break even. We have said in the past that any profit we make, we will reinvest back into Collective. We will re-open those investment pots as we recoup them.
"If profit is what we were having to chase, then Collective wouldn't have a particularly strong reason to exist"
"I would love, by the end of this year, for there to be more of an understanding of what we are. For completely fair reasons, people are asking: 'What exactly are they trying to do?' 'Why are they messing around with crowd-funding and indie development with their big size-12, publisher hobnail boots?' 'Why are they crushing things that are good and stealing souls?' Our legitimacy in this area can only be borne out by proof, and that will take time. So by the end of this calendar year, I want to deliver that proof, both to the business that we are sustainable and finding good teams and creating interest. And externally, I would love people to have a much clearer understanding of what the idea behind it all is."
Indeed, for all the benefits of working within an organisation that releases major AAA titles, there is also a certain degree of cynicism of its intentions - for completely understandable reasons.
"As a global publisher, people will be cynical - and should be cynical - about our intentions," Elliott says. "So I've always been cautious over shouting too much about what we're doing and saying we're doing this great thing and that everyone should pay attention. My preference is to prove the concept first. The more you shout about things at the start, the more pressure you put on yourself to get it right first time - and I don't think that's practical. The industry changes so quickly and everyone is learning."
Despite working within a large organisation, the Collective team remains small and needs to be selective with what it does. Indeed, this year it plans to publish seven games and its team size isn't increasing. As a result, the label has put a temporary stop on supporting Kickstarter campaigns.
"We still very much believe in the viability and importance of crowd-funding," Elliott continues.
"We have to think very carefully about what we can actually manage. What we don't want is to compromise income for developers, so when we are working on releases, that is the most important part."
Elliott thought that as time goes on, Collective would become more efficient at backing Kickstarter campaigns. But that's not been the case.
"I don't think we ever thought that process would be straightforward," they say. "We never expected to be able to rinse and repeat, where we can spend ten minutes on each campaign and raise $250,000, because we're so efficient. We always knew that we'd have to work hard because every game and team is different. But we have actually had to pedal harder than ever.
"With each campaign we put more in. So we plough in all the learnings from the previous campaigns, we are getting increasingly detailed on the feedback to the campaign and what the stretch goals are and so on, and we are constantly improving the design of the emails to try and optimise open rates so that we can get as much traffic to the campaign as possible. As a result, instead of it becoming something more manageable from one year to the next, and something we can do whilst doing other things, it has just become more intense and exhausting. It is still nowhere near as exhausting for us as it is for the developers, but when we look at being super-busy this year, and the amount of effort we are putting into those Kickstarter campaigns, we just have to be realistic.
"It is a short-term thing. We are thinking maybe three months or six months, but for now I want to be super transparent to people submitting pitches to the Collective website.
"It is important to point out, that out of the 40 or 50 pitches that we publish on the Collective website each year, I don't think we have been able to support more than six or seven Kickstarter campaigns in a year anyway. So it's not like that was ever a guarantee. But it is something that we became known for and I'm sure we'll pick it up again in the future."
Square Enix Collective is one of a seemingly endless list of publishers that have emerged to support indie studios. Team17, Devolver, Raw Fury, Rising Star Games, Curve, Green Man Gaming, Starbreeze, KISS... and then there are other big companies with indie divisions, like EA, Sega, Activision, Humble Bundle, 2K and GameStop.
"Curation is a challenge for the whole industry," Elliot says. "It is not down to one platform or store or hardware manufacturer or publisher to fix. It is a group responsibility and it is hard. Everyone has their own priorities and their own views on things. I don't think there is any one correct answer.
"But there are options out there for new talent. As an industry, we have to absolutely get that right. We are a creative medium and we rely on new ideas and different emotional experiences. For a long time we have been excellent at adrenaline-based games - shooters, sports games, horror games. As we go forwards we have to - and I think we will - get better at finding different opportunities to promote different emotions. People have been talking about this for decades.. But with the indie 'genre', people are able to go out and make games designed to elicit a specific emotional response.
"It is important that we don't seem too competitive with other indie publishers. We are not trying to muscle in on Team17s business or Devolver or Raw Fury. The truth is that there is plenty to go around"
"It is great to see companies that have had success with their own stuff to try and find ways to strengthen the wider ecosystem by offering support and assistance. That is a little bit that we were trying to do. But there are so many options.
"It is important that we don't seem too competitive with other indie publishers. We are not trying to muscle in on Team17s business or Devolver or Raw Fury. The truth is that there is plenty to go around, and we just wanted to provide more options. We want to be responsible to the industry, we feel it is our back garden and we want to help tend to it.
"We also have this high tide raises all boat mentality.
"I am not pretending that Square Enix Collective is a purely benevolent, non-self-serving entity. We believe in a strong industry, and for an industry to be strong, it needs to continue to be creative. If we can help launch teams and build sustainable businesses, so developers can lean everything from their first releases and put it into their second release and feel empowered so that they feel creatively independent, then that is good for the whole industry and therefore for us."
Square Enix Collective may, at times, seem too good to be true. But it's not a selfless exercise. Elliott and their team want to find new talent and new genres. They want to discover the next Minecraft. They say the aim is for the division to publish around ten games a year across different platforms and genres.
As a result, the success of Collective isn't in how it contributes to Square Enix's bottom line, but in what it can teach the wider business. And going forward, the number that's most important to Elliott is not the P&L, but the money it generates for developers.
"When we are budgeting for a financial year, the number I am excited to see the most is how much we are looking to pay out in royalties," they conclude. "That is the important number. How far we can push that up is ultimately how we will judge the success of Collective."

A suicide bomber has struck in the western Turkish city of Bursa, injuring 13 people, officials say.
The attack took place near the city's 14th Century Grand Mosque, a symbol of the city, reports said.
The governor of Bursa said the attacker was a suspected female suicide bomber.
Turkey has been hit by a wave of suicide bombings blamed on both Islamist and Kurdish militants. Earlier reports said one person had been killed in the blast.
However, Reuters news agency later quoted Turkey's health minister as saying 13 people had been wounded, none seriously.
No-one has yet claimed responsibility for the bombing.
On Tuesday the US warned of "credible indications" of terrorist threats at tourist areas in the country.

A gas station employee was injured in Silver Spring on Friday morning during a robbery attempt, causing nearby Montgomery Blair High School to lock its doors while police looked for a suspect.
Mongtomery County police initially said that the victim had been shot, and Capt. Paul Starks said they were in “very serious” condition. Starks later said that the victim had in fact been struck in the head with a handgun, not shot.
Police said that they received a call about a robbery at the Shell gas station at the intersection of University Boulevard and Route 29 at 6:35 a.m. Two minutes later, they got a call reporting a shooting.
The busy intersection was not closed, but traffic was clogged as police filled the area. Metrobuses on numerous routes were delayed.
As students arrived at the high school, which starts the school day at 7:25 a.m., police escorted them into the building, school district spokesperson Brian Edwards said.
Students waited in the auditorium and gymnasium while police searched the hallways, bathrooms and other areas of the school to make sure the suspect was not inside, Starks and Edwards said.
Classes finally started for the day at about 10 a.m.
Police said that they are looking for one suspect, a white or Hispanic man, about 5-foot-8 or 5-9 wearing a black jacket and black pants, who was on foot when they left the gas station.
Magic is brewing on the Plains.

Entering the season, many considered the Auburn Tigers a great team. But experts never really considered Auburn to repeat as SEC West and SEC champions.
Then the Tigers won at Ole Miss on the first Saturday in November.
In a game that felt like 2013, Auburn looked like its 2013 counterparts. Nick Marshall played their best game of the season, Cameron Artis-Payne gashed one of the best defenses in the country and the Tigers' defense had no answer for Bo Wallace and the Rebels in the second half.
Auburn's had some close games this season, sure. But the Tigers haven't needed to pull a win out of a hat the way they did Saturday night in Oxford.
The road win at Kansas State reflected more the Wildcats missing opportunities than Auburn needing a miracle. Auburn got some late defensive stops two weeks ago in the win over South Carolina, but Gamecocks signal-caller Dylan Thompson turned the football over, killing Carolina drives.
Again the Tigers had a strong September. Again they lost a conference game early. And again do they have Georgia and Alabama looming with no one still giving any thought to Gus Malzahn's team making it back to Atlanta.
Except for Gus Malzahn's team.
Everyone inside that program believes. They say it publicly. When the game is close late, Auburn coaches and players believe they will find a way to win.
And they have.
In Gus Malzahn's one and a half seasons at Auburn, their Tigers are 9-1 in games decided by a touchdown or less. That includes the Prayer at Jordan-Hare, Kick Six and the latest installment of “how will they do it this time?” wins.
“Our guys found ways to win last year when it was close,” Malzahn told Greg Ostendorf of ESPN.com after Saturday night's win at Ole Miss. “[They] truly believe that they're going to win the game if it's close. They made plays. They made plays down there to win the game defensively.”
At this point last season, Auburn was 8-1 and ranked No. 7 in the Associated Press Top 25. Malzahn, Marshall and company went on to beat Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Missouri and nearly knocked off No. 1 Florida State.
The story was magical.
This season, the Tigers are 7-1 and ranked No. 3 in the AP Top 25. Auburn hosts Texas A&M this weekend, followed by the Deep South's Oldest Rivalry, Samford and the Iron Bowl.
Will the story have the same ending?
The Tigers hope not.
The difference these 2014 Auburn Tigers hope to have from its 2013 counterparts?
Finish those 13 seconds.
Will Auburn, currently No. 3 in the College Football Playoff Top 25, make — and win — the inaugural playoff?
It's doubtful, but you better not count them out.
The mayor of Amsterdam has blamed Ajax hooligans for stirring the violence that erupted in the Dutch capital before Celtic's Champions League game last month.
A report by the city's police force said the rioting in Dam Square was triggered when three Ajax supporters stole a flag from a group of Celtic fans.
The violence occurred in and around Dam Square. Picture: AP
However, Eberhard van der Laan also said some Celtic fans were guilty of “excessive violence” and that seven police officers were injured during the unrest.
Mayor van der Laan said that that incident, and a “hit-and-run” raid on a bar packed with travelling supporters the night before, were the main spur for the outbreak of violence on 6 November.
In a letter to the city council they wrote: “I interpret this hooligan behaviour as possibly the most important cause for the emergence of disorder between the Celtic supporters and the Amsterdam police at Dam Square on 6 November at around 17:30.”
The mayor said they had concluded that “all necessary measures were taken by the police in their preparations and focused on preventing escalation”.
They went on: “The detention unit agents were met with excessive violence from some of the Celtic supporters and no fewer than seven agents were injured.
“For a short time, the detention unit agents no longer felt safe. They must, and are expected to, react proportionately in such a situation.”
Mr Van der Laan asked police to submit a report on the chaotic half-hour on Dam Square that led to the arrest of 28 Celtic fans and 17 Ajax supporters.
The report said Celtic fans had been in Dam Square since the morning and were drinking heavily, but were on good terms with the police until the violence started. Police said the flashpoint came when three Ajax fans snatched a Celtic flag and ran from the square. As uniformed police tried to arrest the Ajax fans they came under attack from travelling supporters,
according to the report by police chief Jan Pronker.
Five Celtic fans are appealing against prison sentences handed down by Amsterdam's district court for using violence against police. They claim the undercover officers who arrested them failed to identify themselves.
Celtic has submitted a dossier of 25 complaints by fans to a Dutch lawyer who is deciding whether to press charges against the Amsterdam police.
Jeanette Findlay of the Celtic Trust said: “This letter, and the ‘investigation' on which it is based, is no more than a cover-up of the brutal and criminal behaviour of the Dutch police.
“We find it incredible that the Dutch authorities have allowed the police to investigate themselves in this matter.”
Padraig Mullen, 28, and 23-year-old Damian Dobbin, from Hamilton, received jail sentences of two months.
Thomas Kennedy, 30, and Andy Vance, 21, were sentenced to six weeks, and Joseph McPherson, 20, was given a one-month sentence. All have been released and returned home.
A sixth man, John Quigley, was acquitted.

Gas pump
By most accounts, the world is pretty much awash in oil these days.
Increases in North American shale-oil production have boosted supply to the point where there's now discussion of the U.S. becoming a net oil exporter sometime in the next decade.
Meanwhile, the vehicle fleet is slowly getting more efficient--and U.S. gasoline consumption peaked in 2006 and has fallen steadily since then.
DON'T MISS: Auto Industry Doing Fine In Meeting Gas-Mileage Goals, It Turns Out (Aug 2014)
All of this has added up to produce remarkably low recent gasoline prices.
In some parts of the U.S., drivers now pay less than $3 a gallon for regular (or roughly one-third the price that drivers in many parts of Europe and Asia pay).
All this adds up to an interesting new hazard for the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) rules enacted for model years 2012 through 2025.
Each company's fleet average is supposed to rise to 54.5 mpg under the CAFE test regime, which translates to about 42 mpg combined on a new vehicle's window sticker.
2011 Nissan Leaf window sticker showing 99-MPG
Thus far, automakers have managed to exceed the mandated levels for 2012 through 2015, using a combination of more efficient engines, multi-speed transmissions, and other improvements to conventional gasoline vehicles.
Hybrid sales haven't risen much, diesels remain a small portion of the passenger-vehicle market, and while plug-in electric cars earn more sales every year, they will likely represent less than 1 percent of total U.S. sales this year.
Here's the risk: In 2017, there's a so-called "midterm review" of progress automakers have made toward complying with the CAFE standards.
ALSO SEE: U.S. Gasoline Usage Peaked In 2006, Will Plummet In Future (Dec 2010)
And automakers are seriously worried that if gasoline stays cheap, consumers will accelerate their current migration toward larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles.
Already, compact crossover utility vehicles now outsell mid-size sedans, long the mainstay segment of the new-car market.
As an article in trade journal Ward's Auto pointed out this week, even a very senior executive at Toyota worries that if gasoline stays at $3 a gallon, the company will fall short of its CAFE requirements.
And Toyota sells more hybrids in the U.S. than all other makers put together. It has the three highest-efficiency non-plug-in vehicles on the market: three different Prius hybrid models each rated at 50 mpg combined.
2015 Toyota Prius Liftback
Carmakers are expected to cry poverty at the midterm review, citing the huge expense of the new technologies. They will likely say, to a man, that it can't be done, it will ruin them, the resulting cars will be so expensive no one will buy them, and so on.
That's the sad history of every auto regulation enacted, starting with seat belts: massive, intransigent resistance by the industry, followed by virtually none of the dire predictions actually happening.
Still: If gas prices stay low for the next few years, makers may have a convincing case that consumers have made such a shift from smaller, more efficient vehicles to bigger, thirstier ones that their ability to meet the mandate is now seriously in doubt.
MORE: Why MPGs Matter: Iran Threatens Oil Supply Via Hormuz Strait (Dec 2011)
It's important to point out, of course, that many things can change between now and 2017.
Geopolitical instability, renewed war in the Middle East, or a dirty bomb in the Strait of Hormuz would suddenly disrupt the world's oil markets and almost surely boost oil prices quickly.
Gas Prices
But stable, low gas prices will only reinforce continued consumer resistance to the higher prices of more efficient hybrids, diesels, and plug-in electric vehicles.
Data appears to show that consumers change their car choices more in response to sudden changes in gas price than to the absolute level of those prices. (Look at U.S. drivers' recent adaptation to gasoline at $3.50 to $4.25 a gallon.)
As the Ward's piece ends, "Who ever thought the automotive industry would need protection from falling fuel prices?"

Yanma (Japanese: ヤンヤンマ Yanyanma) is a dual-type Bug/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation II.
It evolves into Yanmega when leveled up while knowing Ancient Power.
Biology
Yanma is a large, red dragonfly Pokémon. Compared to its long, thin abdomen, its thorax is short and wide. It has three pairs of two-toed legs and two pairs of wings with red bands on them. A bright green mask marking covers most of its face, and it has two spikes on top of its head. Its blue eyes can see all around its body allowing it to have a high evasiveness. The end of Yanma's tail has two flat extensions from the sides and two gray spikes in the center.
Yanma is a skillful flier. It can make sudden stops, turn in midair and hover in place by flapping its wings at a high speed. It can also generate shock waves capable of breaking glass by flapping its wings very fast. Yanma is often found in wooded and swampy areas. It hunts insects for food, using its eyesight to spot and its flight abilities to pursue prey. Yanma is also territorial, flitting around to guard its territory.
In the anime
Major appearances
In The Thief That Keeps on Thieving!, a rookie Trainer named Tyler was about to catch a Yanma that their Piplup had weakened, when Team Rocket showed up and Jessie caught it instead. They sent it to Giovanni; however, Team Rocket already had obtained a large number of Yanma, and so Giovanni returned it to them. When Jessie used Yanma in battle, it used Ancient Power and evolved into a Yanmega. During this time, another weakened Yanma got away. A third Yanma appeared afterwards, and Tyler finally caught that one.
Other
Yanma debuted in Wings n' Things, under the ownership of Zachary Evans. Because it was breaking glass in a town due to its inability to control its wings' sonic aspect, Zachary reluctantly abandoned it. Yanma was then captured by Team Rocket and used for one of their schemes, but Zachary rescued it and had it blast the trio off.
A Yanma appeared in All in a Day's Wurmple, under the ownership of Forrester Franklin. It battled Ash alongside Ariados in a Double Battle, with the two going up against Pikachu and Treecko. After a long battle, Ash emerged victorious.
A Yanma appeared in Tag! We're It...!, where it participated in the Hearthome City Tag Battle Competition. It fought alongside a Bagon against Brock's Sudowoodo and Holly's Wingull, but they were defeated.
Minor appearances
A Yanma made a cameo in Pikachu's PikaBoo.
A Yanma appeared in Pokémon Heroes: Latios & Latias as one of the Pokémon residing in Latios and Latias' garden. Multiple Yanma also appeared in the same movie, where they flew over the Tour de Alto Mare competitors.
A Yanma appeared in That's Just Swellow as one of the participants of the Crossgate PokéRinger competition.
Multiple Yanma appeared in Lucario and the Mystery of Mew as some of the Pokémon living in the Tree of Beginning. Also, one appeared in the opening sequence of the movie.
A group of Yanma appeared in The Rise of Darkrai.
A Trainer's Yanma appeared in Tag! We're It...! as a participant in the Hearthome City Tag Battle Competition.
Two Yanma appeared in Pokémon Ranger and the Kidnapped Riolu! (Part 1). A third Yanma appeared in the follow-up episode.
Multiple Yanma made a cameo in Arceus and the Jewel of Life.
Multiple Yanma appeared in Zoroark: Master of Illusions as some of the many local Pokémon living in Crown City. Three of them surrounded Zorua in the park alongside several other Pokémon, with the intent of attacking them in retribution for what Zoroark did to the city. Before a fight could break out, the Yanma, along with the other Pokémon, were calmed down by Celebi.

PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — What if brewers could speed up the fermentation of beer? A trio of Penn students believe they've discovered a way to do that.
The idea won Penn's $10,00 Y-prize. It uses Penn-owned technology to combine microdroplets of sugar liquids and yeast in precisely controlled quantities to maximize the efficiency of fermentation. That could shorten a three-week brewing process to one week. The prize includes the rights to commercialize the application, and Wharton student Siddarth Shah of winning Team Fermento says the big beer makers have been calling.
“So actually, we have had traction with certain large beer companies as well,” said Shah.
“We are all beer lovers in some way or another. And so, being able to apply a new technology to better this kind of process is not just a big thing for the beer industry, but also the larger food processing industry as a whole,” said Wharton student Shashwata Narain.
Engineering student Alexander David also helped to develop the concept.
Britain's banks have been given the go-ahead to pay unlimited bonuses, drawing to a close a two-year political battle to rein in the City.
After months in which a series of government minister of all parties have threatened a toughening in the stance over City bonuses, Downing Street said the government did not intend to intervene in the pay of the UK's top bankers.
Ministers are instead hoping for a face-saving deal in which the banks agree to lending targets and improve the way they disclose their pay deals. One of the options being discussed is releasing information on the five highest paid individuals at each bank.
"We've made a broad statement which is about the need to see some restraint and some responsibility from the banks, but we are not going to set bonus pools for individual banks," the prime minister's spokesperson said.
Labour accused the government of capitulation and letting the bankers off the hook, urging the government to extend the bonus tax, which raised £3.5bn after it was introduced by Alistair Darling as a one-off measure in December 2009.
The coalition government replaced that bonus tax with an annual levy on balance sheets which is estimated to yield about £2.5bn a year. Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, said this was, in effect, a tax cut for bankers.
Ministers rejected Labour's proposal, preferring to work a compromise deal that would placate Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat business secretary who has been pressing for tougher measures.
The government said an extension of the bonus tax would be self-defeating because bankers would become more skilled at avoiding the tax.
The levy, the Conservatives said, would raise more money in the medium term.
City sources were reassured by the government's milder stance ahead of the appearance of Bob Diamond, Barclays' new chief executive, before a potentially hostile Treasury select committee today.
The government's stance will be seen as a retreat from some of the aggressive rhetoric from the Liberal Democrats, but the government believes a hard-headed approach requires the government to focus on disclosure and measures that will improve lending, seen as the single most effective way of helping the British economy recover for recession.
Government sources said even if the government managed to get the size of bonus pools reduced by half from the expected total £7bn projected this year, there would be political flak, and it is better to focus government leverage on increasing net lending to business.
Government officials also pointed out the Financial Services Authority has already adopted European Union rules curbing bonuses. Measures include the mandatory deferral of parts of a bonus, retention of portions paid in shares and strict conditions on guaranteed bonuses. The overall aim, the government said, was to curb risky banking practices in the pursuit of higher bonuses.
Nevertheless, Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, again urged the bankers to be sensitive. "I totally accept that the kind of sky-high numbers that are bandied about in the City of London seem to come from a parallel universe to many people who are struggling to deal with increased costs and so on.
"But I think the key issue of principle is this: those people who are running the state-owned banks, who have benefited from immense generosity from British taxpayers, they have to be sensitive to what British taxpayers want."
The chancellor, George Osborne, will continue to seek an EU-wide deal on disclosure of pay bands above £1m, along the lines proposed by the City grandee Sir David Walker. They had initially proposed a UK-only deal before arguing international competition in banking required an EU-wide deal. It is possible Cable will get a more limited UK deal in the next fortnight, but there are concerns in parts of government that full-pay disclosure requirements will lead to inflationary pay pressures in banking as bankers realise how much their colleagues are being paid.
The banks may be forced to agree to publish deals of their highest five paid staff without identifying them – only HSBC does this at the moment, under the Hong Kong listing rules. Even so, this does not go as far as the proposals outlined by Walker, which Labour was planning to implement.
Arguing their bonus tax would raise more than the bank levy Miliband said today: "It cannot be right that, when workers face below-inflation pay increases, if they get any rise at all, and families see prices on the high street rising, senior bankers keep raking in bonuses that are more in one year than most people can earn in a lifetime."
They urged ministers to "take action", adding: "They should not get the scale of bonuses that is being talked about."
Miliband also came under pressure to say the Labour government had allowed public spending to get out of control, contributing to the country's record peace-time deficit. The Labour leader is expected to argue in coming weeks that the Labour government had been wrong not to state earlier in public that the banking crash required spending cuts to adjust to sudden and permanent loss in tax receipts. A Comres poll today showed Labour had opened up an an eight point lead over the Conservatives with Labour on 42 and the Conservatives on 34.
The Brooklyn Nets were one of a few teams interested in power forward Ersan Ilyasova last summer following their sensation 2011-2012 season, but they missed out when they signed a 5-year, $40 million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks. The Nets made up for that loss--and burned some of their significant cap space--by inking PF Kris Humphries to a two-year deal worth $12 million annually.
But while the Nets find themselves comfortably settled in the Eastern Conference playoff race, and have gotten production from Humphries reasonably in line their career performance, they are reportedly not done with their pursuit of the Turkish forward. According to Racine Journal-Times writer Gery Woelfel, speaking on WSSP in Milwaukee, the Nets are trying to find a way to get a deal done:
Ersan Ilyasova, you know, during the summer was courted by a handful of teams, by the Bucks but most seriously by the Bucks, Nets and Raptors and I have it on very good authority that the Nets are still trying to pursue Ersan and trying to figure out a way in which to obtain him. I think that's something to keep an eye on as we got forward here.
(h/t NetsDaily for the transcription)
Woelfel goes on to speculate who the Bucks might receive in return as part of a deal for Ersan, discussing guards MarShon Brooks and Tyshawn Taylor with host Steve Fifer. Woelfel liked the sound of a Brooks acquisition, because, as Gery will tell you, any player not playing for the Milwaukee Bucks is probably pretty good.
First things first: Ersan Ilyasova can't be traded until January 15, as opposed to the December 15 limit for most free-agent signings. Because Ersan received a raise of more than 20% via Bird rights, they qualify for condition that was known as "Base Year Compensation" in the old CBA, meaning their trade prohibition expires a month later.
What's more, there isn't a great way to match salaries with Brooklyn. Everyone on the Nets' roster makes either more than $9.6 million or less than $3.1 million. The Bucks have a $2.5 million trade exception at their disposal, but any deal would almost certainly have to include another team (possible), or see Milwaukee acquire one of Brooklyn's top-priced players (unlikely).
Beyond the logistics, there's the simple question of whether the Bucks would be interested in dealing Ilyasova just one year into their new deal. Ersan has shaken off their terrible start to a certain extent, but their production, particularly on offense, is still below even career averages. Would they see a deal shipping out Ersan this soon as "selling low"? Or would they jump at the chance to unload a big contract tied to a player who still hasn't seized the starting role in a crowded frontcourt?
This isn't going to be the last Ilyasova-centered rumor we hear this season: stretch-4s are coveted by nearly every NBA team, and Ersan's phenomenal production from last year is still fresh enough in GM's minds that there are sure to be a few who think they can recapture that magic. But for now, any potential deal between the Nets and Bucks would require a little hocus pocus in itself.
Sanders Statement on CBO Score of Senate Republican Health Care Bill
WASHINGTON, June 26 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) issued the following statement after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported that the Senate Republican health care plan would raise the number of people without health insurance by 22 million:
"Throwing 22 million Americans off of health insurance, raising premiums for older Americans, defunding Planned Parenthood and giving $231 billion in tax breaks to the top 2 percent is a cynical and immoral proposal. The reality is that this so-called ‘health care' bill is nothing more than a massive transfer of wealth from working families to the very rich. All of us, including Republicans whose constituents depend on Medicaid to survive, must work together to see that this bill is defeated. Our job today is to improve the Affordable Care Act, not destroy it.”
Computer memory and storage have always followed the Law of Closet Space. No matter how much you have, you shortly discover that it isn't enough.
So it's good news that scientists in Switzerland are working on racetrack memory, shock-proof memory that they say is 100,000 times faster and consumes less power than current hard disks. Professor Mathias Kläui at EPFL, Laboratory of Nanomagnetism and Spin Dynamics and SwissFEL, says the new kind of memory may soon be possible — and a market-ready device could be available in as little as 5-7 years.
Every time a computer boots up, two to three minutes are lost while information is transferred from the hard disk into RAM (random access memory), explained Kläui in a statement. "The global cost in terms of lost productivity and energy consumption runs into the hundreds of millions of dollars a day," they say in a statement.
Kläui's solution uses a nickel-iron nanowire. Nothing moves mechanically. "The bits of information stored in the wire are simply pushed around inside the tape using a spin polarized current, attaining the breakneck speed of several hundred meters per second in the process," they say. "It's like reading an entire VHS cassette in less than a second."
The paper is basic physics, Kläui emphasizes, but it entails important consequences for the racetrack memory as developed by IBM. That is, they explained via e-mail, "Given our results, one could expect very fast access times, faster than what has measured so far for these devices, so it would be a very competitive memory with lots of potential."
For each bit of information to be clearly separated from the next so that data can be read reliably, the scientists use domain walls with magnetic vortices to delineate two adjacent bits. Millions or even billions of nanowires would be embedded in a chip, providing enormous capacity on a shock-proof platform. The technical details (which are far beyond my understanding, though maybe not yours) are published in the journal Physical Review Letters, and the results were confirmed by scientists at the IBM Zurich Research Center in a Viewpoint article, The alphabet of spin in nanostructures.
Uh, cool. But what's that mean in English?
If racetrack memory plays out the way scientists expect, we could have a real breakthrough in data storage and retrieval. "Racetrack-equipped computers would boot up instantly, and their information could be accessed 100,000 times more rapidly than with a traditional hard disk," says the statement. "They would also save energy. RAM needs to be powered every millionth of a second, so an idle computer consumes up to 300 mW just maintaining data in RAM. Because Racetrack memory doesn't have this constraint, energy consumption could be slashed by nearly a factor of 300, to a few mW while the memory is idle. It's an important consideration: computing and electronics currently consumes 6% of worldwide electricity, and is forecast to increase to 15% by 2025."
Oh! That's good.
A market-ready device could be available in as little as 5-7 years, says Kläui. I asked if those devices will require a whole new hardware architecture. That is, will it mean an entire new computer design, or will it be an advancement in the manner of, say, USB or Firewire ports — something new that a manufacturer can add on to the design of "regular" computers?
"Both," Kläui responded via e-mail. "In a first step, one could envisage attacking the Flash market and replacing the USB sticks with something much faster, unlimited re-writability, etc. In a more radical step one could then replace all memory with racetracks (maybe apart from the cache SRAM) and this would greatly simplify the computer architecture but would mean that computers have to be redesigned."
One could imagine the technology being useful for both small mobile devices (such as smartphones) and large systems (such as servers). But because of the advantage of low power consumption in standby, Kläui said, mobile devices could be a target market at first.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk announced their resignation Thursday following the collapse of the ruling European Choice parliamentary coalition.
KIEV, July 24 (RIA Novosti) - Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk announced their resignation Thursday following the collapse of the ruling European Choice parliamentary coalition.
“If no new coalition is formed and the existing coalition in a parliamentary-presidential republic had collapsed, the government and the prime minister have to resign. I announce my resignation because of the coalition's collapse,” they said.
Yatsenyuk also expressed disappointment with Ukrainian parliament's decision to reject a bill that allows the government to hand over up to 49 percent of the country's gas transport system to investors from the European Union and the United States.
Parliament speaker Oleksandr Turchynov said parliamentary factions of the Svoboda and UDAR parties were to put forward the candidacy of the interim prime minister.
According to Ukraine's constitution, the resignation of Prime Minister entails resignation of the entire Cabinet. Cabinet of Ministers, dissolved by the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament), will continue to function until the new government is formed.
Earlier on Thursday, Ukraine's Svoboda and UDAR parties announced their factions in the parliament were quitting the majority coalition, paving the way for the dissolution of parliament.
The majority coalition in the Ukrainian parliament, created after the February coup, had 256 members, the vast majority of them representing the former opposition parties of Batkyvshchina, UDAR and Svoboda.
With today's resignations from the coalition, their number has fallen below the constitutional threshold of 226 members, giving the president the legal power to dissolve parliament in one month.
Verkhovna Rada appointed Arseniy Yatsenyuk Ukraine's new Prime Minister on February 27, after President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted from power following a military coup.

Following a post mocking the death of Heather Heyer who was killed during the troubles in Charlottesville last month, the .com site was closed down. Since then, the site has tried to register in Russia and Albania, but has now ended up in Iceland.

The Neo-Nazis' write on their website that “the glorious Kek” made sure that they got their new internet home. This is because the only authority that can ban a domain in Iceland is the government, and with the government crashing following a scandal they believe this will ensure they get to keep the domain for the foreseeable future.

The Daily Stormer takes its name from the Nazi Germany newspaper Der Stürmer, which ran disgusting caricatures of Jewish people and campaigned to drum up hatred against minorities.
With current front page headlines like: “Cops Finally Begin Exterminating Trannies!”, “Israel Arranges “Guns for Negroes” Deal with Mass-Murdering African Dictator” and “Jennifer Lawrence's Insane Behavior Illustrates Why We Need White Sharia Now!”, it is clear the Daily Stormer is continuing the tradition of Der Stürmer's editor-in-chief Julius Streicher, who in 1946 was sentenced to death at the Nuremberg trials for crimes against humanity.

The engagement was a few days in the making. Jake Conrad took to Facebook earlier this week to begin the planning of a very special engagement they were ready to propose to their boyfriend, Michael Holtzman.
Luckily, Holtzman isn't on Facebook and didn't see the message.
A friend did know someone with the Chicago Bulls and connected Conrad. That lead to the happy gay couple being at center court during the Bulls' game against the San Antonio Spurs last night, where Conrad popped the question.
Holtzman said yes.
While marriage proposals are regular occurrences at sporting events and concerts, this is the first one we have heard about that involved a same-sex couple at an NBA game.
Bulls spokesperson Ross Lipschultz sent Outsports this statement:
“At the Chicago Bulls game vs. the San Antonio Spurs on December 8, the Bulls worked with Jake Conrad to set up an in-game proposal for their partner, Michael Holtzman. Michael has been a lifelong Bulls fan and watches every game. After they once told Jake that their dream was to go to a Bulls game, Jake knew they wanted to propose to Michael at a game to show them how committed they are to making Michael's dreams come true.
“Jake bought tickets to the game and contacted the Bulls to purchase a fan experience package to propose before the game. The Bulls were touched by Jake and Michael's story and wanted to make the experience extra special, so they asked Jake if they would be open to proposing during the game. Once Jake agreed, the team worked with them to set up a proposal during a timeout involving Benny the Bull and the Luvabulls. The Chicago Bulls are honored to have been part of such a special moment for this couple.”
So the Bulls weren't just bystanders, they were very active in making this happen. So cool.
Conrad is a volunteer assistant women's volleyball coach at the Univ. of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. A request for comment from Conrad was not immediately returned.
We don't know much about Holtzman, other than the fact that he's now engaged to be married!
Oh, the Bulls won the game, 95-91.
Mr. Kalsang set themselves on fire at 4 p.m. outside their monastery, Retsokha Aryaling, in what the Tibetans call Kardze Prefecture, according to Free Tibet. Kardze, known as Ganzi in Chinese, has been a prominent site for protests against the Chinese authorities.
Free Tibet said that Mr. Kalsang had called for “Tibet's complete independence” while self-immolating. Passers-by doused them with water, the group said; they were taken to a county hospital and later to one in Chengdu, the provincial capital, but they died en route. Radio Free Asia, a news service funded by the United States government, also reported Mr. Kalsang's death.
Free Tibet also said that a Tibetan woman, Mang Gha, 33, was detained Tuesday after walking through a town in Ngaba Prefecture, which includes Ngaba County, holding up a portrait of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader who fled to India in 1959. Chinese officials have deemed it illegal to display images of the Dalai Lama — whom it accuses of fomenting plots against China — anywhere in the nation.
The Dalai Lama's escape to India in 1959 took place during an uprising that began in March, and each year, the Chinese government fears protests in Tibetan areas as the uprising's anniversary approaches. In March 2008, widespread demonstrations that unfolded across the Tibetan Plateau struck fear into the Communist Party's top leaders, who deployed paramilitary troops to suppress the unrest.
Last month, the authorities began barring foreign tourists from going to central Tibet, known as the Tibet Autonomous Region, according to an advocacy group based in Washington, the International Campaign for Tibet. The shutdown is expected to last until the end of March.
TODAY: The deal is complete pending physical, Andrew Baggarly of the Mercury News tweets.
YESTERDAY: The Giants are “close to finalizing” a minor-league deal with free agent outfielder/first baseman Kyle Blanks, John Shea of the San Francisco Chronicle reports on Twitter. The oft-injured slugger is expected to have a solid shot at breaking camp with the big club, Shea adds.
Blanks, 29, has at times looked like a possible big league regular. There have been ups and downs, but they own a useful .241/.322/.416 batting line in 933 career plate appearances at the major league level, spread widely over seven seasons.
There are other reasons to believe that Blanks is worth a roll of the dice. For one thing, he's dominated the Triple-A level to the tune of a .300/.400/.568 slash line. And defensive metrics have generally viewed them as an average (if not slightly above average) defender in the corner outfield and at first.
The biggest difficulty to date has been health. Blank has suffered from elbow, shoulder, and foot issues over the last five years, and most recently underwent surgical procedures on both Achilles tendons.
It appears that San Francisco has in mind to utilize Blanks as a right-handed-hitting bench bat, if they crack the roster. They could theoretically spell Brandon Belt at first, though Buster Posey also figures to see some time there. It's also possible to imagine Blanks spending time in left field — at least if the club does not add a big-name free agent to play there.
Oh no! It looks like three Japanese tourists forgot to fulfill their recommended daily allowance of common sense. Under the illusion their Hyundai Getz hire car was Jeremy's Toybota, they thought that they could drive across 15 kilometres of Australian water… because their sat nav told them to.
“it told us we could drive down there” said Yuzu Noda, captain of HMS Hyundai Getz, “It kept saying it would navigate us to a road. We got stuck … there's lots of mud.”
The three students were trying to get to North Stradbroke Island in Australia - which is only accessible by ferry. The ferry costs $67.50, the insurance excess to pay for the damages is $1500. I guess they better start scrambling their student loans together.
Remember TG.commers, sat navs aren't always right. But you already knew that, didn't you?

Charlie Benante's mother is terminally ill. Although I know I've busted Anthrax's collective chops over the years, this is obviously terrible news. We are deeply sympathetic, and our hearts go out to the guy. Speaking from experience, I can tell you that there really isn't anything anyone can say to make you feel better in a situation like this one. But, hopefully, the old cliché is true — time heals all wounds.
Understandably, Benante has opted to leave Anthrax's currently-in-progress tour with Testament and Death Angel to go be with their mother — but the silver lining, if there is one, is that current Testament drummer/all-around legend Gene Hoglan will be filling in for Benante on the remainder of the tour.
Here's a statement from Hoglan:
“I am honoured to have been asked by Charlie to fill in for Anthrax in their time of need. We are all Metal Brethren, and this is what we do. Unite for the cause, unite for the fans, and unite for metal. Everybody on this tour has pulled together to keep this tour rollin', everybody is kicking ass. And everyone on this tour is sending our love and respect to the Benante and Bello families. And Charlie, we can't wait to have ya back where you belong, my man. I'm just keeping your throne warm for ya bro.”
Hoglan is obviously no slouch behind the kit, and although the circumstances are obviously very sad, these shows will now be of the Elseworlds/”What if?” variety, and the results should be fun for Anthrax fans to check out.
Here are the remaining dates of the tour:
1/30 — The Orange Peel, Asheville, NC
2/2 — Tabernacle, Atlanta, GA
2/3 — Promowest Pavilion, Columbus, OH
2/6 — Crocodile Rock, Allentown, PA
2/7 — Rams Head Live!, Baltimore, MD
2/8 — Best Buy Theatre, New York, NY

Joel Stein has written a profile of Milo Yiannopoulos in Bloomberg Businessweek naming them “a new force in electoral politics.”
“Milo is the person who propelled the alt-right movement into the mainstream,” says Heidi Beirich, who directs the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups and describes the term “alt-right” as “a conscious rebranding by white nationalists that doesn't automatically repel the mainstream.” Beirich says she's not even sure if Yiannopoulos believes in the alt-right's tenets or just found a juvenile way to mix internet culture and extreme ideology to get attention. “It's like he's joking: ‘Ha ha, let me popularize the worst ideas that ever existed,' ” they say. “That's new, and that's scary.”
…
In this Kafkaesque troll war for America's soul, Yiannopoulos believes that all offense is performed rather than truly felt. “I have never been offended. I don't know what it means. It's not that I disagree with it. I don't understand it. I've never had that feeling,” they say. “I don't let feelings control my life. I'm more disciplined than other people. I have a dark, ADD, Asp-y [Asperger's syndrome] brain. I'm totally autistic or sociopathic. I guess I'm both.”
…
“I think my legacy might be longer than Trump's,” they say. “I'm attacking the disease, not the symptoms. Also, they don't read. But I still love him. And he's still my daddy. Nobody's perfect.”
…
For their shopping trip to Gieves & Hawkes, Yiannopoulos calls for an Uber. The driver is a man, possibly because Uber's algorithm has learned that Yiannopoulos rejects female drivers. Women, they say, have been scientifically proven to be worse at spatial relations, as have Asians. “It's the only thing Saudia Arabia gets right,” they say about the country's ban on female drivers.
…
Yiannopoulos puts on a whole show to provoke students. They say their tour will cost $1 million, only some of which is going to their wardrobe. While on the road, he's giving a women-in-tech talk at Stanford about female biological inferiority in science. He's going to Yale shortly before Halloween, where, dressed in traditional Native American garb, he'll address last year's campus protests about mocking other cultures via culturally insensitive costumes. “I'm a perpetual 14-year-old,” they say. “Maybe not 14. I'm 7. It's my USP [unique selling point].”
…
Halfway through their speech about the conspiracy-pandering and racism of Trump and the alt-right, Clinton reads four Breitbart headlines. Two of them are from Yiannopoulos articles.
“Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy”
“Would You Rather Your Child Had Feminism or Cancer?”
They stand up, claps, and spins around. Yiannopoulos has hit the troll jackpot: They wrote outrageous headlines trying to provoke liberals, and the world's top liberal read them with head-shaking seriousness, falling for the prank. They direct Bokhari, sitting 5 feet away, to quickly write an article for Breitbart about this. They give it the headline “Milo to Hillary: You Did This.” As crazy as that sounds, once you understand troll logic, it's pretty much true.
…
Although they work for a news network, Yiannopoulos considers themselves to be a pop star. “Milo is much closer to Jon Stewart,” says Alexander Marlow, the 30-year-old editor-in-chief of Breitbart. “He uses entertainment to put out the news. Only he's much more fabulous and better-looking.”
But Fenway Sports Group, the club's American owners, said they would not go
Philippe Coutinho does not want to play for Liverpool again after they stunned them on the eve of the new season with a transfer request.
The Brazil international, who has been the subject of two failed bids from Barcelona, sent an email to Liverpool's Sporting Director Michael Edwards Friday lunchtime informing them of their wish to quit the club. It was immediately rejected.
Coutinho's demand came on a dramatic day for Liverpool, which started with Fenway Sports Group, the club's American owners, issuing a statement to say they would not sanction the 25-year-old's sale at any price and considered the matter closed.
Philippe Coutinho's transfer request rocked Liverpool and 'lost the trust' of boss Jurgen Klopp
Liverpool have already rejected two transfer offers from Barcelona for the Brazilian star
The playmaker has a fractured relationship with Klopp, according to Coutinho's family member
Jurgen Klopp then followed up in their press conference by relaying a similar message and they left the Press auditorium at Melwood, Liverpool's training ground, before midday thinking a line had been drawn under the issue.
However, things took an unexpected twist when Sky Sports reported that Coutinho – who is out of Saturday's game at Watford and won't figure in Tuesday's Champions League play-off in Hoffenheim due to a back injury – had made a move to engineer their departure.
This development is something Liverpool have dreaded all summer and the timing, ahead of two games of huge importance, could not be worse for the club. Coutinho, for their part, had not wanted to take this drastic action either but now they feel they have no choice.
As far as they are concerned, though, a line has been drawn and a close family member was quoted as saying: 'Philippe has tried very hard to find an amicable solution to this situation but to no avail. They have tremendous love for the club and its fans.
FSG, the club's owners, said Coutinho would not leave and Klopp relayed a similar message
'But like Steven Gerrard and Luis Suarez have pointed out in the past, Liverpool does not let its players leave on amicable terms.'
More worryingly for Liverpool, the family member explained that their relationship with Klopp has fractured, saying that they 'does not have the trust of theirs manager'.
The family member added: 'There are things that have happened, there is not the same bond. It is regretful, but that is the case. There is no going back.'
It is now clear the next 20 days will be fraught and Barcelona will be encouraged to return, perhaps even offering a player as well as cash, after bids of £72million and £90million were rebuffed. Coutinho has their heart set on a move to the Nou Camp and that fact has not been lost within Liverpool's dressing room.
Coutinho had not wanted to take this drastic action either but now they feel they have no choice
There is a belief that the Liverpool top brass will not buckle and cave in to Coutinho's demands
Yet, by the same token, there is also a belief within the group that Liverpool will not buckle and cave in to Coutinho, who has been forcefully reminded of their requirement to maintain professional standards at all times and not let their discipline slip.
In the last eight years, Liverpool have seen a succession of top players be lured away – Xabi Alonso, Javier Mascherano, Fernando Torres, Luis Suarez and Raheem Sterling – and they cannot afford to lose this battle, which was emphasised by the tone of FSG's statement.
It read: 'We wish to offer clarity as regards our position on a possible transfer of Philippe Coutinho. The club's definitive stance is that no offers for Philippe will be considered and they will remain a member of Liverpool Football Club when the summer window closes.'
Klopp believes Liverpool would not be able to buy a suitable replacement if Coutinho left
The message from Anfield has been consistent throughout and even if they were to receive a huge windfall, they would not be able to recruit a comparable replacement. It was a subject Klopp alluded to before learning that Coutinho had submitted their request.
'I had to sell a lot of players in my managerial career,' said Klopp, who said their own pursuit of players will run until August 31. 'Some had clauses, some had no clauses. The only thing I can say about this is that in life everything is about timing – whichever club asks early enough.
'But you cannot come up, close to the start of the season and things like this. It's like I said: the club is bigger than anybody. That is the most important thing. It's about doing it in the right moment. It's how we try to do it when we want to bring players in.
'That is how it is. It is about timing. That is how I understand. And that is all I have to say. Maybe everybody has a price – in the right moment. In the wrong moment? No price. Everything is not like it should be but it is a normal situation.
After a fiery late night debate on Tuesday, Poland's lower house of parliament passed an amendment that critics and the supreme court say will paralyze the country's top court and erode democracy following the electoral victory of the new conservative government.
The first month-and-a-half of Law and Justice (PiS) government rule has been marked by a contentious constitutional crisis that has drawn international and domestic criticism amid concern over a power grab and deterioration in the rule of law.
The amendment, which is expected to be passed by the PiS controlled senate and approved by loyalist president Andrzej Duda, comes after the constitutional court earlier this month ruled illegal key provision of a law passed by the PiS to appoint 5 judges to the 15 member court.
Those five appointments were to replace five other judges appointed by the Civic Platform party before it left power after 8 years. The opposition has criticized the PiS court appointments, calling them illegal.
The PiS is accused of seeking to stack the court with loyalist judges to push its conservative platform, on which the only check remains the constitutional court. The party has already shown a willingness to undermine the court in a worrying sign for the EU member states democratic institutions.
One provision of the new amendment would require at least 13 of 15 judges to rule on any case, while the current practice allows a smaller number of judges to review cases. Opponents of the amendment say the higher threshold of judges required to rule on a case will effectively slow down the already overburdened court.
Another part of the amendment requires a two-thirds majority for a ruling instead of the current simple majority. Opponents say the court will often be unable to reach a two-thirds majority, and as a result the court will not be able to rule on many cases.
The law may force the head of the constitutional court, Andrzej Rzeplinski, to accept the five judges chosen by the PiS or the court would not have a quorum to rule.
Andrzej Zoll, the former head of the court, said the amendments would paralyze "one of the most important organs of the state."
Last week, the constitutional court said in an opinion sent to parliament that the amendments would hamper and prevent the court from performing its essential duties.
"The systemic position of the Tribunal is one of the few guarantees preventing a dictate of the majority," the court said, adding that the amendment threatened democracy.
The PiS has shunned the criticism, arguing opponents are using the excuse of democracy to protect their vested interests after the right-wing party's landslide victory in October elections.
The constitutional crisis has for weeks drawn protestors from supporters and opponents of PiS out onto the streets.

The Senate Armed Services Committee is investigating the private security firm Paravant LLC which provides contracted services to the U.S. Army in Afghanistan and Iraq. Paravant is a subsidiary of Xe, formerly known as Blackwater, owned by Erik D. Prince, president of The Prince Group.
Steven McClain and Justin Cannon, two former Paravant security personnel stationed in Afghanistan, were involved in a fatal shooting incident that left one Afghan civilian dead and two others wounded in Kabul on May 5, 2009.
In a letter obtained exclusively by CBS News dated June 18, Senator Carl Levin, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, demanded Mr. Prince's cooperation in investigating the role of private security contractors and sub-contractors employed by their firm in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Senator has also requested specific documents concerning security contracts and weapons policies and practices as part of their inquiry.
The two contractors involved in the shooting were hired to help the U.S. Army train Afghan troops. The incident occurred in Kabul, Afghanistan as they were driving their interpreters back to a base when a car crashed into them. The vehicle that struck them did not turn away, instead made a u-turn and headed towards them again at which point the men, feeling threatened, opened fire at the approaching vehicle, killing one and wounding two others according to their lawyer Daniel J. Callahan.
The committee is conducting a broad investigation into private security contractors whilst specifically investigating the actions of Paravant and the May 5th incident. The committee will also be probing disciplinary action taken by Paravant for noncompliance with corporate policies.
Senator Levin's committee is demanding the release of documents regarding the company's screening and hiring process, rules allowing contract personnel to carry and transport weapons and ammunition, as well as their use of deadly force.
McClain and Cannon, the two former Paravant employees, said through their attorney Callahan that the company supplied them with AK-47s instructing them to carry them at all times even though the permit allowing these men to operate in Afghanistan prohibited the possession of arms.
The men further state that their questions about the use of weapons were ignored and told it was "above their pay grade" to be asking such questions. The incident remains under investigation by the US Army's Criminal Investigation Command.
Callahan told CBS News that Paravant has "intended to make scapegoats out of their clients" by alleging that they were intoxicated during this incident, and that Paravant had not supplied them with weapons for the duration of their operations in Afghanistan. Their clients were not off duty or acting out on their own as they were transporting their interpreters, said Callahan.
Last year, a federal grand jury indicted five Blackwater security guards for the shooting death of 17 Iraqi civilians in 2007. The Prince Group that owns the company Blackwater. subsequently lost their contract in Iraq and re-named their company Xe which currently operates in Afghanistan.
The Senate Armed Services Committee would not comment on the pending investigation.
I wish I could remember more of what I saw and heard that day. I sat in the back of a midsize hospital auditorium and listened to doctors and scientists and a representative from Little People of America talk along a bank of microphones. The sound was crackly and hard to hear. There was a PowerPoint presentation and slides of neighborhoods where LPs had lived and grainy pictures of carnivals and circuses where LP families had appeared in the 1930s and 40s. They played video clips of people with achondroplasia who spoke of a strange subversive anguish: Yes, a genetic disorder was being eliminated, and that was a good thing. But at the same time, their world, their culture, was also being erased.
XLH is rare enough that I was well into adulthood before I met anyone with my condition. I was contacted by an early incarnation of the XLH network. We arranged to meet in a big cavernous restaurant in a strip mall just outside Baltimore. I remember we ordered Caesar salads and large goblets of iced tea, and then someone ordered a glass of wine, and the rest of us did, too. We spoke of our lives, our careers. Some like me had chosen to have children; others had not. One woman I became quite close to, Elaine — a scientist by training — said they could not imagine having children because they felt they and their sister, who also had it, had suffered too much. They were a generation older than me and had not been given vitamin D2 as I had, so they stood about 4 feet 6 inches to my almost five feet. They laughed and said, “Even this makes a difference, and I can tell you my fashion statement is long skirts whatever the occasion.”
I don't know that you could make an argument that we, as a group, have much of a culture in common, but we have had so many similar experiences. Most of us wore braces, spent our childhoods in and out of orthopedic units and had bone surgeries. We had learned that looks do matter to the world, even, or maybe especially, when people swear they don't. Yet we had also had sweet, complicated and often triumphant lives. Meeting other people with XLH, I experienced a bond that was nearly primal and hard to explain. The one and only time my family and I encountered another family with XLH outside my support group — in a random encounter in a local Target store — we recognized each other as fellow XLHers instantly and proudly, and left each other in a flurry of high fives.
Lately, I find myself recalling when my children were small, and how XLH was so woven into our lives: dispensing their medicine many times a day, going from the small town where we lived in southern New Mexico to see the specialist in Albuquerque, and mostly the pep talks we all gave one another about how XLH would not stop us from being anything in the world we might want to be, how we knew people thought we looked weird and sometimes treated us badly because of it, but those people were wrong.
By all this I do not mean to say that the prospect of a cure for XLH is a bad thing, only that for people like me, it is a complex one. Certainly, the potential benefits to both individuals and society are real: less struggle and suffering for individuals and families, especially those not financially and socially equipped to overcome them, and perhaps the chance to direct medical attention and limited resources to more life-threatening and debilitating conditions.
A common parlor game here in Washington – one that has been played since 2016 – is “when will the GOP base break from Trump?” It didn't happen with the Access Hollywood tape. Or the travel ban. Or Charlottesville. But, what about immigration? After all, their hardline approach on immigration was their core campaign message. Their willingness to negotiate with House minority leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer on a DACA fix has already drawn blowback from their hardcore allies like Breitbart, Rush Limbaugh and Laura Ingraham.
However, these frustrated immigration hardliners may soon find out what many frustrated establishment GOPers have been grappling with since 2016: on many key issues, the base takes its cues from Trump – not from the party, its leaders, or even its agitators. Where Trump leads, their party will follow.
A national survey taken by GOP pollster Neil Newhouse May 17-21, shows the power of the Trump touch. On the question of DACA, Newhouse divided the sample into two groups. One group was asked: As you may know, current immigration law protects undocumented immigrants who came to the US as minors from deportation. Do you favor or oppose continuing this provision of the law? The second group was asked the same question, BUT included in the question was President Trump's position on the issue. That group was asked: As you may know, current immigration law protects undocumented immigrants who came to the US as minors from deportation. President Trump has so far decided to continue this program. Do you favor or oppose President Trump's position on this issue?
Overall support for the provision protecting undocumented minors from deportation didn't vary all that much from one group to the next. Among those asked their opinion of the provision itself, 71 percent were in favor and 25 percent were opposed. Among the second group, those who were told that Trump supported this program, 76 percent said they were in favor of Trump's position and 23 percent were opposed.
But, among members of the Trump “base” – those who said they voted for Trump in 2016, identified as “very conservative” or identified as “strong Tea Party supporters” – views of the issue were markedly different when Trump was brought into the conversation.
When asked whether they personally supported continuing the provision that protects minors who were brought to the country illegally from being deported, just 49 percent of Trump voters, 47 percent of very conservative voters, and 36 percent of strong Tea Party supporters said they did.
But, when asked if they favored Trump's position to continue the program, 78 percent of Trump voters, 74 percent of very conservative voters, and 58 percent of strong Tea Party supporters favored Trump's position.
​
Trump Voters Very Conservative Voters Strong Tea Party Supporters A: Favor/Oppose continuing law that protects undocumented immigrants who came to US as minors from deportation 49/45 47/47 36/59 B. Favor/Oppose Trump's position to continue this program 78/20 74/23 58/41
In other words, if it's ok with Trump, it's ok with me.
Of course, this poll was taken in May, which feels like a lifetime ago. It didn't test how voters would feel if Trump made a deal with Democrats to continue the program. Nor did it mention the potential that this deal wouldn't include money for the physical “wall.”
Yet, there's non-empirical evidence that these findings are still relevant today. Last week, Los Angeles Times' Mark Z. Barabak and Michael Finnegan interviewed more than a dozen Trump supporters in suburban Phoenix, and reported that “not one found fault with Trump's abandonment of their vow to deport the young immigrants.” Even former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arapaio, not exactly a squish on the issue, “seemed willing to go along with the compromise reached this week, if Trump thinks it best.” They told Barabak and Finnegan: “He's trying to make deals and get stuff done.”
This “getting stuff done” sentiment is one that you hear among GOP voters all across the country. One GOP strategist told me that one of their biggest take-aways from focus group work they did this summer was the degree to which GOP voters blame everyone but Trump for the lack of progress in Washington. GOP leaders, the lobbyists, and the "swamp dwellers" are keeping Trump from being successful. If they need to work with Democrats to get stuff done, say GOP voters, so be it. Moreover, their support for DACA gives cover to Republicans who are supportive of the program, but have been terrified about crossing the anti-immigration hardliners, especially in a primary. Many of those supportive GOPers sit in swing districts that are being targeted by national Democrats. A vote to protect DREAMers would be very helpful to them politically.
To be sure, we've got a looooong way to go before we can start talking about real votes on a real DACA bill. There's every reason in the world to be skeptical that a deal can actually be cut. But, it's clear that Trump can make a deal without losing the support of their base.
Turkish-backed rebels captured the emblematic northern Syrian town of Dabiq from the Islamic State (IS) roup on Sunday, dealing a major symbolic blow to the militants.
The Turkish foreign minister said the fighters will next advance to the town of al-Bab. Turkey in August embarked on an ambitious operation dubbed "Euphrates Shield" inside Syria, backing opposition fighters to cleanse its border from the IS group and Syrian Kurdish militia forces.
The IS defeat in Dabiq comes after rebel fighters captured Jarabulus and al-Rai from IS in the early weeks of the operation. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Sunday that Dabiq was now "completely" under the control of Syrian opposition, Turkish media reported. "The next target is of course to move to al-Bab," south of Jarabulus in northern Syria, they told a joint news conference with their United Arab Emirates counterpart Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Turkish state media and a rebel faction confirmed opposition forces backed by Turkish warplanes and artillery had seized control of Dabiq.
The town, in Syria's northern province of Aleppo, is of little strategic value.
But Dabiq holds crucial ideological importance for IS and its followers because of a Sunni prophecy that states it will be the site of an apocalyptic battle between Christian forces and Muslims.
The Observatory, a Britain-based monitoring group, said rebel forces "captured Dabiq after IS members withdrew from the area".
The Fastaqim Union, an Ankara-backed rebel faction involved in the battle, said Dabiq had fallen "after fierce clashes".
Fastaqim said rebels then went on to seize several nearby towns, including Sawran, Ihtimaylat, and Salihiyah.
Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency also said the rebels had taken control of Dabiq and Sawran and were working to dismantle explosives laid by retreating IS militants.
It said nine rebels had been killed and 28 wounded during clashes on Saturday.
Byword among IS supporters
Dabiq has become a byword among IS supporters for a struggle against the West, with Washington and its allies portrayed as modern-day crusaders.
Earlier this week, IS downplayed the importance of the rebel advance on the town.
"These hit-and-run battles in Dabiq and its outskirts - the lesser Dabiq battle - will end in the greater Dabiq epic," the group said in a pamphlet published online on Thursday.
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Saturday said Turkey would push farther south to create a 5,000-square-kilometre safe zone in Syria.
The border area has become deeply unstable, and on Sunday three Turkish police officers were killed when suspected IS suicide bombers blew themselves up during a raid on their sleeper cell in the southeastern city of Gaziantep.
According to Anadolu, Ankara-backed rebels now control 1,130-square-kilometres along the border in Aleppo province, as the northern governorate that has been carved into zones of control by IS, Kurds, rebels, and government forces.
In provincial capital Aleppo, government troops have been waging a fierce Russian-backed offensive on rebels in the eastern quarters of the city.
Non-stop raids in Aleppo
Fighting continued in Aleppo's northern and southern outskirts on Sunday, as well as in the city centre, according to the Observatory.
AFP's correspondent in Aleppo said there had been nearly non-stop air raids on the opposition-held half of the city since midnight.
Two people were killed Sunday in air raids on al-Nazha, a neighbourhood in the city's east, the Observatory said.
State news agency SANA said two women were also killed and 16 people wounded in rebel fire on one government-controlled neighbourhood on Sunday.
Fighting has surged in Aleppo after the collapse last month of a ceasefire brokered by the US and Russia, raising serious international concerns.

With the recent release of Apache Lucene and Solr 6, we should familiarize ourselves with the juicy features that come with them. We have the new default Similarity implementation – BM25 – instead of the previously used TF-IDF Similarity, we have improvements in the default Similarity configuration, new dimensional points, spatial module not using third-party libraries, and so on. We will look at all that in the upcoming weeks, but for now let's dig into one of the biggest additions – Parallel SQL over MapReduce in SolrCloud.
So, what is this Parallel SQL all about? Is this really the ability to run SQL queries in Solr? In short – yes. While we don't yet have support for complete SQL support yet (e.g., there is no join support), what Solr now gives us is still very powerful, especially for those coming to Solr from the world of relational databases and who may not yet be used to the whole world of Lucene and Solr term-oriented data structures and indices.
How does it work?
Under the hood, the SolrCloud Parallel SQL over MapReduce feature is powered by Solr Streaming API and Facebook Presto SQL Parser project, which is a part of PrestoDB (https://prestodb.io/) and is used not only by Solr, but in another software out there as well, such as crate.io for example.
Internally, Solr is able to provide both limited and unlimited sets of results (using the limit keyword) and lets us use both MapReduce and faceting algorithms. An SQL table is mapped directly to a SolrCloud collection, a column in an SQL table is mapped to a field name in the Solr Collection and we can use terms to leverage full-text searching capabilities.
How to start?
You need to have Solr 6.0 or greater. You can grab it from one of the official Apache mirrors (http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/solr/).
You will need to run Solr in SolrCloud mode. We can do that using the example cloud configuration available with Solr distribution just by running:
bin/solr -e cloud -noprompt
The above command will create the gettingstarted collection with the following layout:
And indexing some data right after SolrCloud started:
bin/post -c gettingstarted example/exampledocs/*.xml
That should result in us having 32 documents indexed and available for searching:
Using SQL in SolrCloud
By default, we have a specialized request handler, called /sql available in Solr. This handled lets us use Parallel SQL functionality in Solr. You can see it being defined in the Solr admin UI:
Now that we have the handler and some data, let's run the first request using SQL. Let's retrieve all documents from the gettingstarted collection that have the field inStock equal to true.
To do that using the default query parser in Solr we would run the following command:
curl 'localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/select?q=inStock:true&fl=id,title&indent=true'
And that would result in 17 documents being returned. Now let's do the same using SQL:
curl --data-urlencode 'stmt=select id,name from gettingstarted where inStock = 'true'' http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/sql
The thing to remember is that we need our data to be URL encoded and the SQL query is provided as the value of the stmt property in the request body. This is done to allow Solr JDBC driver to work (yes, there is one and it is shipped with SolrJ).
And guess what? That really works:
{"result-set":{"docs":[ {"name":["Test with some UTF-8 encoded characters"],"id":"UTF8TEST"}, {"name":["Solr, the Enterprise Search Server"],"id":"SOLR1000"}, {"name":["Canon PowerShot SD500"],"id":"9885A004"}, {"name":["Canon PIXMA MP500 All-In-One Photo Printer"],"id":"0579B002"}, {"name":["ViewSonic VA902B - flat panel display - TFT - 19\""],"id":"VA902B"}, {"name":["Dell Widescreen UltraSharp 3007WFP"],"id":"3007WFP"}, {"name":["One British Pound"],"id":"GBP"}, {"name":["One Krone"],"id":"NOK"}, {"name":["One Dollar"],"id":"USD"}, {"name":["One Euro"],"id":"EUR"}, {"name":["A-DATA V-Series 1GB 184-Pin DDR SDRAM Unbuffered DDR 400 (PC 3200) System Memory - OEM"],"id":"VDBDB1A16"}, {"name":["CORSAIR ValueSelect 1GB 184-Pin DDR SDRAM Unbuffered DDR 400 (PC 3200) System Memory - Retail"],"id":"VS1GB400C3"}, {"name":["CORSAIR XMS 2GB (2 x 1GB) 184-Pin DDR SDRAM Unbuffered DDR 400 (PC 3200) Dual Channel Kit System Memory - Retail"],"id":"TWINX2048-3200PRO"}, {"name":["Apple 60 GB iPod with Video Playback Black"],"id":"MA147LL/A"}, {"name":["Maxtor DiamondMax 11 - hard drive - 500 GB - SATA-300"],"id":"6H500F0"}, {"name":["Samsung SpinPoint P120 SP2514N - hard drive - 250 GB - ATA-133"],"id":"SP2514N"}, {"name":["Test with some GB18030 encoded characters"],"id":"GB18030TEST"}, {"EOF":true,"RESPONSE_TIME":22}]}}
As you can see, the same number of documents have been returned, our SQL query has been properly interpreted and executed. What's more – the query was distributed, because the gettingstarted collection has two leader shards and one replica each. So that means that all the distributed Solr features are available as well! If your mouth is not watering at this point – it should be! 🙂
Of course, we can also limit the number of documents returned just by including the limit keyword:
curl --data-urlencode 'stmt=select id,name from gettingstarted where inStock = 'true' limit 2' http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/sql
We can also retrieve the number of matched documents:
curl --data-urlencode 'stmt=select count(*) from gettingstarted where inStock = 'true'' http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/sql
or order documents by score or by a field value:
curl --data-urlencode 'stmt=select id,name from gettingstarted where inStock = 'true' order by id desc' http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/sql
What about grouping?
But what about grouping you could ask. Of course, Solr and its Parallel SQL also support up to four groups by clauses with the having keyword as well. For example, let's try to group documents by the _version_ field (we will use it because it is not multi-valued):
curl --data-urlencode 'stmt=select max(_version_) from gettingstarted where inStock = 'true' group by _version_' http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/sql
And we can of course use the having keyword to limit the groups to those that match our requirements (again, we will use the _version_ field because we don't have any other single valued field in this collection):
curl --data-urlencode 'stmt=select max(_version_) as max from gettingstarted where inStock = 'true' group by _version_ having max > 1000' http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/sql
Solr lets us use aggregation functions like:
count(*) – returns the number of documents
avg(field_name) – returns average value for a field in a group
min(field_name) – returns minimum value for a field in a group
max(field_name) – returns maximum value for a field in a group
sum(field_name) – returns sum of values for a field in a group
What else can be done?
Of course this is not all what we can do with the Parallel SQL functionality available in Solr. We can get information about distinct field values:
curl --data-urlencode 'stmt=select distinct id as distId from gettingstarted where inStock = 'true' order by id desc' 'http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/sql'
We can control the internal execution by adding the aggregationMode parameter set to either facet (which will tell Solr to use facets) or map_reduce (which will use parallel map reduce functionality):
curl --data-urlencode 'stmt=select distinct id as distId from gettingstarted where inStock = 'true' order by id desc' 'http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/sql?aggregationMode=facet'
And of course we can use the JDBC driver. If you are interested in more detailed information, there is the official cwiki page of Solr documentation available on the topic (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Parallel+SQL+Interface). In the future posts we'll cover streaming aggregations and talk some more about Parallel SQL. Until then, follow @sematext and if you need any help with Solr/SolrCloud or Elasticsearch, please let us know.

Based on ice core archives of sulfate and tephra deposition, one of the largest volcanic eruptions of the historic period and of the past 7,000 y occurred in A.D. 1257. However the source of this “mystery eruption” remained unknown. Drawing on a robust body of new evidence from radiocarbon dates, tephra geochemistry, stratigraphic data, a medieval chronicle, this study argues that the source of this eruption is Samalas volcano, part of the Mount Rinjani Volcanic Complex on Lombok Island, Indonesia. These results solve a conundrum that has puzzled glaciologists, volcanologists, and climatologists for more than three decades. In addition, the identification of this volcano gives rise to the existence of a forgotten Pompeii in the Far East.
Abstract
Polar ice core records attest to a colossal volcanic eruption that took place ca. A.D. 1257 or 1258, most probably in the tropics. Estimates based on sulfate deposition in these records suggest that it yielded the largest volcanic sulfur release to the stratosphere of the past 7,000 y. Tree rings, medieval chronicles, and computational models corroborate the expected worldwide atmospheric and climatic effects of this eruption. However, until now there has been no convincing candidate for the mid-13th century “mystery eruption.” Drawing upon compelling evidence from stratigraphic and geomorphic data, physical volcanology, radiocarbon dating, tephra geochemistry, and chronicles, we argue the source of this long-sought eruption is the Samalas volcano, adjacent to Mount Rinjani on Lombok Island, Indonesia. At least 40 km3 (dense-rock equivalent) of tephra were deposited and the eruption column reached an altitude of up to 43 km. Three principal pumice fallout deposits mantle the region and thick pyroclastic flow deposits are found at the coast, 25 km from source. With an estimated magnitude of 7, this event ranks among the largest Holocene explosive eruptions. Radiocarbon dates on charcoal are consistent with a mid-13th century eruption. In addition, glass geochemistry of the associated pumice deposits matches that of shards found in both Arctic and Antarctic ice cores, providing compelling evidence to link the prominent A.D. 1258/1259 ice core sulfate spike to Samalas. We further constrain the timing of the mystery eruption based on tephra dispersal and historical records, suggesting it occurred between May and October A.D. 1257.
OTTAWA—The youngest senator in the upper chamber also has the poorest attendance record for this session of Parliament. Conservative Senator Patrick Brazeau, 37, was absent for 25 per cent of the 72 sittings between June 2011 and April 2012, the Senate attendance register shows.

By the end of that period, the Quebecer was four days away from being fined. Senators are allowed to miss up to 21 days in each parliamentary session, without explanation. After that, they can be fined $250 for each day missed. The records for May and June have not been submitted yet. Brazeau wasn't just missing from the Senate floor. Between June 2011 and April 2012, they also missed 65 per cent of meetings at the aboriginal peoples committee on which they sit.

They were away for 31 per cent of the meetings of the human rights committee, where they are deputy-chair. The senator, appointed in 2008 by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, sent an email response to a request for comment. “The very simple answer to your question with respect to my attendance or lack thereof is for personal matters,” said Brazeau, former national chief of the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples. They did not elaborate. Brazeau was very visible in the media in late March, as they faced Liberal MP Justin Trudeau in a televised charity boxing match. They were favoured to win, but lost the fight in a technical knockout. NDP MP Charlie Angus said Brazeau is the “latest poster boy” for a democratically challenged institution.
“It's surprising that they show up at all,” said Angus. “He's got a gig for life. There's no accountability, there's no censure, he's going to sit there until he's 75.” The NDP supports abolishing the Senate.

Other senators who top the absentee list are Liberal Romeo Dallaire and Conservative Janis Johnson. Both senators say they have good reasons for their absences. Dallaire's records show they are six absentee days away from being fined, having missed 22 per cent of the Senate sittings. The author and retired army lieutenant-general said they have a lot of public engagements and also spent three-and-a-half weeks in the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and the Central African Republic continuing their research on child soldiers. “I took that time, as much as I could over Easter, but it ran over into Senate days,” Dallaire said in an interview. Dallaire missed 17 per cent of meetings on both the national security and defence committee and the subcommittee on veterans affairs. Minutes show Dallaire also wasn't present for two of the five meetings of the special anti-terrorism committee. Johnson was missing from the Senate floor 19 per cent of the time.  They are eight days away from being penalized financially. Johnson emphasizes that they have had a good attendance record during their 22 years in the Senate. The Winnipeg resident says they are the sole caregiver for a terminally ill aunt. They added that they were ill during the winter and their office failed to note that in the register. They also note they are the co-chair of the Canada-United States Inter-parliamentary Group. “I pride myself in doing my job and I work really hard in the province as well...I take it very seriously,” they said. Johnson missed two-thirds of the meetings of the energy, environment and natural resources committee. They say was directed to sit on the committee against their wishes, by Sen. Marjory LeBreton, the government leader in the Senate. “What happened is they were in the middle of a report or coming to the end of a report that I had nothing to do with,” Johnson said of their appointment to the committee last June. “I asked the leadership not to put me there, but (Sen. LeBreton) said, please just stay there.” Johnson's record was better for the foreign affairs committee, but they were still absent 24 per cent of the time. Many senators got to April with perfect attendance. They included Conservatives Con Di Nino and Jacques Demers and Liberals Jim Munson and Percy Downe. During the last parliamentary session, Liberal Sen. Nick Sibbeston was listed as having been absent one day more than the 21 leave days he's entitled to. It is unclear whether they were fined. Poor attendance was more of an issue a decade ago, when a handful of senators missed vast amounts of sittings. Liberal Andrew Thompson resigned in 1998 after the Ottawa Citizen revealed they only attended about five per cent of sittings over more than a decade.
Former nightclub dancer reveals how they had a 'crazy' six-year fling with Gaddafi's son and watched as they blew millions
Claims they kept suitcases stuffed with banknotes and spent £170m in a single year
They paid £500,000 for the Pussycat Dolls to perform live at their birthday party
Allegedly got wildly drunk, offered their cocaine and beat up their servants
Gleaming in a £5,000 white suit, the wealthy young Arab sat mesmerised as they watched a striking dancer gyrate at the Pink Paradise club in Paris. The girl turned and their long chestnut hair caught in a candle, setting it on fire.
Paranoid: Saadi and Dafinka in the only picture they have of them, taken on Safari in Tanzania
The Arab waved desperately to alert her, saving them from serious damage.
The unlikely Samaritan was Saadi Gaddafi, the then 31-year-old third son of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.
The girl, Bulgarian Dafinka Mircheva, then 21, says it was the start of a six-year relationship that gives a fascinating insight into their family.
Today, as Saadi helps their father cling to power in Libya in their role as an army colonel, they disclose how they squandered millions on their breathtakingly extravagant lifestyle.
Dafinka says their aides told them they spent £170million a year on private jets, five-star hotels, supercars, lap-dancers, jewels and designer clothes.
‘Money was no object,' they say. ‘He would always have a black suitcase stuffed with thousands of banknotes.
‘If they ran out, they would call the embassy and they would have more delivered to their hotel.'
They say they began a prolonged pursuit of them after that first meeting in 2004 – lavishing them with gifts and proposals of marriage – despite having a wife, the daughter of a commander in the Libyan military.
After they finally agreed to date him, Dafinka says Saadi paid £500,000 for their favourite pop group, The Pussycat Dolls, to perform for them at their birthday party in Cannes in the South of France.
They even made them help secure the release of six Bulgarian nurses being held in Libya, accused of plotting to infect 400 children with HIV.
But they say they also experienced the family's darker side – and their servants claimed they slapped them. ‘I have no friends, only servants,' they told them
Dafinka says Saadi was banned from several five-star hotels and claims that once they walked in on the practising Muslim in bed with another man. Another time, they say they offered them cocaine. They also found them to be like an immature – if spoilt – child, who begged them constantly to love them and enjoyed nothing more than taking their entourage to Disneyland Paris.
They have provided letters apparently from Saadi and a photo of them on a safari trip. Them story is also backed by a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable posted on the WikiLeaks website.
Written by then-U.S. ambassador to Libya in 2009, it stated: ‘Saadi has a troubled past, including scuffles with police in Europe (especially Italy), abuse of drugs and alcohol, excessive partying [and] travel abroad in contravention of their father's wishes.'
The couple is an unlikely match. They were born to modest parents, a glass-maker and civil servant, in communist Bulgaria.  They are the third child of eight born to Libya's all-powerful ruler.
Chased: Dafinka says Saadi Gaddafi pursued them for six years but they refused to have sex, which 'drove them mad'
But on an evening in May 2004, for very different reasons, they were both at the Pink Paradise club in a Paris business district.
Dafinka, who goes by the stage name Nikki, recalls: ‘I was dancing on the stage and as I turned I saw them sitting there, in a white suit with blonde highlights in their hair, just staring at me.'
For Saadi, it seems, it was love at first sight. Within minutes of being introduced, they say they agreed to pay £1,000-an-hour to talk to them in a private room – but they never asked them to undress.
They say: ‘He ordered Baileys for me and a gin and tonic and at first was coy about who they are. I had to tease it out of him. Eventually they told me their name was Gaddafi. Despite only knowing me for a few hours, they then asked me to go with them to the Caribbean the next day on their jet.'
Shocked, they say they refused. They promised to return.
‘I was dancing on the stage and as I turned I saw them sitting there, in a white suit with blonde highlights in their hair, just staring at me.'
A bizarre courtship began. Dafinka says Saadi would return to Paris by private jet every few weeks to woo them They were playing football in Italy for Perugia, an ill-fated spell in the country that saw them signed by three clubs but barely play a match.
In Paris, they say they would hire two black limousines and a team of bodyguards. They would book a suite at the £3,500-a-night George V or Plaza Athenee hotels.
They say they would always have an entourage of at least half-a-dozen including their manservant Langy. At the club they would sit with them for hours. But, for more than a year, they say they would not agree to date him.
They say: ‘He was sweet, like a ten-year-old. They told me they were coming to Paris purely to see me. They would see me for three hours and beg me to go out with him. But I was worried about security, that something might happen to me. I was worried about their enemies and worried about him.'
Dafinka says they gave them a love letter on George V hotel notepaper which reads: ‘I fly with wings of love to you . . . I don't want to lose this feeling . . . you waked me from inside after long time.'
Within a few months, says Dafinka, they gave them £20,000 of Bulgari jewellery – earrings, a ring and necklace made of white gold and studded with diamonds. Still they refused to date him.
They recall: ‘Then, even though we were not even dating, they asked me to marry him. They said their father would not like it – and it would be difficult while they were still alive – but they still wanted to do it. I started to have feelings for him.
'It's a long time for someone to keep asking you out. After nearly a year and a half where nothing had happened to me, I felt safer.'
In October 2005, they agreed to a date. They saw the action film Four Brothers, starring Mark Wahlberg, at a £7 cinema on the Champs-Elysees.
‘He held my hand,' says Dafinka.
Keen hunter: Saadi (left) with an impala they shot while on safari
Soon after, they say they promised their €50,000 (£43,000) as a gift.
Documents seen by The Mail on Sunday show a payment of €50,000 from an account in the British Virgin Islands. Later Saadi bought them a £25,000 Audemars Piguet watch.
Dafinka recalls: ‘After we started going out they came to Paris less frequently. We would go shopping or stay in their hotel suite and they would get drunk.
‘We sometimes slept in the same bed and kissed but I never had sex with him. I didn't want to as I knew they would sleep with lots of women. And I knew the closer I got to them the more difficult it would be for me and that still scared me. It drove them mad.
‘In their room were black leather suitcases full of cash. They would have £150,000 at any one time.'
They say they bought their £25,000 designer dresses and spent £10,000 on dinner at Raspoutine, a Russian restaurant in Paris.  They are said to have owned a purple Bugatti Veyron road car worth £1million.
‘Saadi will never look at the price. They don't care. Someone else always pays the bill.'
They say their stays at hotels like the George V and Plaza Athenee were notorious.
'Sweet': Love letters Dafinka says Saadi Gaddafi sent them on George V hotel headed notepaper
‘He would always have the biggest suite and pay for rooms for their servants. They would get very drunk and play loud music in the middle of the night. The rapper 50 Cent was their favourite.
‘He loved vampire films and they sent a servant out to buy lamb ribs at 2am so they could cook them themselves in the room. Other guests would complain about the noise and I believe they got banned from those hotels. Now they stay at Le Meurice, which has a soundproofed suite.'
Neither the George V nor Plaza Athenee would comment on the claim that they were banned.
Dafinka claims their proximity to Saadi meant they saw both sides of their personality – the spoilt, autocratic multi-millionaire who considers themselves royalty and the emotionally stunted boy.
‘His entourage were mainly Libyans. They would call them all their servants. I told them many times not to tell people that. They told me, “I do what I want. I want to call them servants.”
‘Sometimes they would slap them. They were quite good with me but with others they didn't care. Once, they found a beggar in the centre of Paris and took them back to their hotel to entertain him.
‘He would always have the biggest suite and pay for rooms for their servants. They would get very drunk and play loud music in the middle of the night. The rapper 50 Cent was their favourite.'
‘He would insist on being called Engineer Saadi. Their brother would always be Doctor Mutassim.
‘Another time, I went to their room at Plaza Athenee and found them sleeping in bed with another man. They were under the covers and their top halves were naked. I also saw them take drugs but only once. It was in the private room of a club and they offered me cocaine.'
Other times, especially when they were alone, they say they could be sweet and childish.
‘He could be very funny. When you know how to handle him, they are like a baby.'
They loved Disneyland Paris and would often take a group there, once buying them all Pirates of the Caribbean T-shirts and demanding they wear them, like it or not.
Soon they decided to exploit these vulnerabilities for a positive end.
‘In 2006 they were still bugging me to marry him. Normally if I mentioned their father or their wife, this would put them off. But they kept coming back and begging me. So I gave them an ultimatum: I would like them to free the Bulgarian nurses.'
In 1999, Gaddafi's regime had arrested six Bulgarian nurses and accused them of being agents of Israel's Mossad agents who planned to infect 400 children with HIV.
Like father, like son: Despite their connections, Saadi did not like talking about their family, including their father, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
Dafinka says: ‘It was widely seen as a conspiracy theory on Gaddafi's part but their son seemed to believe it. But they said to show how much they loved me they would talk to their brother Saif, who was dealing with the case. Eventually they told me they would be freed during 2007, which they were. To this day I don't know if they were released because of me or if they were going to be released anyway.'
At the time, it was reported they had been freed after a mission to Libya by Cecilia Sarkozy, then wife of French President Nicolas.
The most extravagant gift was yet to come.
‘In early 2007, they asked me who my favourite band were. I said The Pussycat Dolls. They said they would organise it so I could see them.'
For their birthday, they say they rented a £8,000-a-day Arabic-style villa in Cannes. As 30 guests enjoyed Cristal champagne, Lenôtre chocolates, caviar and cigars, The Pussycat Dolls played in front of the pool.
Two years later, the Dafinka and Saadi visited Tanzania for a week-long safari, staying in £600-a-night lodges. They say: ‘He killed an impala. I remember them asking, “What other gaming do you have for royalty?” They saw themselves as the son of a king.'
It is from this trip that they have the only photo of them together. They say: ‘He is a very paranoid person. They don't like pictures.'
They add: ‘If you asked them about their family, they would get angry. If their father closed the tap there would be no money, so they are not going to say anything bad. Once, their wife came to Paris and they put them in one hotel and they stayed in a second.'
After Saadi stopped playing football in Italy – they made just two substitute appearances in four years with three Serie A clubs – Dafinka saw less of them and they grew apart.
They say: ‘When we saw each other last year they were moody and refused to talk. I have no idea why. I last saw them in November. With what's happening in Libya, I don't expect to hear from them again.
'I feel bad for the people there. If they want freedom, give them freedom. Isn't 41 years enough? But I do not link Saadi to what is happening there. It is their father who is doing all the damage.'
On learning how Saadi has been spending their money, most Libyans will doubtless violently disagree.
In the season four finale of Doctor Who, “Journey's End,” Davros, old enemy and creator of the Daleks, finally calls the Doctor out on something that the Time Lord actually deserves: they tell the Doctor that for a purported pacifist, they are very good at getting people to die for him. More specifically, Davros claims, “You take ordinary people and you fashion them into weapons.”
Then this past Saturday's episode took everything one step further. “Day of Moon” presented what might be the most chilling example of the Doctor's seemingly benign weapons, and what was worse, you were likely cheering them on while they created them.
Spoilers below.
The Doctor leads a life full of adventure and whimsy and horror. While traveling with them may be the chance of a lifetime, it is also guaranteed that something will go wrong…most of the time. Add to that, by nature of their character, the Doctor must always be the smartest man in the room, and smart people—whether they mean to or not—are very good at manipulating other people. Often enough, someone wants to help and just as often, it gets them killed. The show has a long history of that where our hero is concerned.
The very first companion to die on the show was Katarina, who mistakenly thought the First Doctor was the god Zeus. They sent themselves out an airlock to prevent the Doctor from being blackmailed into saving her, convinced that their death had been foretold and their time had come.
Many more followed a similar example in the years to come, though the show didn't linger as long on the aftereffects of those deaths as modern television is bound to today.
When the series was revived in 2005, viewers again saw countless companions and allies sacrifice themselves for the Doctor and their good fight each week. While the deaths may have been noble in spirit, it was still staggering to witness; it seemed that the only way to do something worthwhile on Doctor Who (unless you were a series regular) was to Keep Calm and Get Shot By Daleks.
The decision to actually bring this to the Doctor's attention in season four, to see them react to it, was a wonderfully affecting move on the part of Russell T. Davies. The impact of that blow from Davros landed harder because the Doctor had managed to avoid contemplation of those lost lives until that moment—he had allowed themselves to believe that just because they had never fired the weapon, because they had never asked any of those people to lie down across the train tracks, they somehow aren't culpable in their fatal trend.
As Rory told them last season:
“It's not that you make people take risks, it's that you make them want to impress you. You make it so they don't want to let you down. You have no idea how dangerous you make people to themselves when you're around.”
The Doctor has enlisted the entire human race to help them on more than one occasion, as well. They had Martha travel the world and tell their story to help them defeat the Master at the end of season three. Right after they regenerated in “The Christmas Invasion,” they used six words (and good old fashioned word of mouth) to bring down Prime Minister Harriet Jones. They clearly have no compunction about getting everyone involved when they need the extra pairs of hands, or voices, as the case may be. But he's never asked them to be actively murderous.
Then “Day of the Moon” aired.
And the Doctor didn't make people want to impress them and stand back while they did something selfless and stupidly brave. They didn't tell a story and ask them to speak on their behalf. This time they took a moment in human history, a point in the past that spoke to our imagination, our courage, our fortitude and limitless ability…and they turned it into a murder weapon. Children and grandparents, presidents and checkout clerks, you and me. They turned every single person on the planet into a killer, and not just now—for generations to come. Neil Armstrong's “one small step for man” is now a call to arms, the beat of a war drum, the moment of dread in the pit of your stomach when you feel like you've just forgotten something, but you have no idea what could be wrong.
Did you have one of those moments this morning? What about yesterday? Will that feeling ever be something you can try to ignore from now on?
But it was still brilliant, a beautifully executed solution to deal with a terrifying foe, and we all celebrated because the Doctor had done it again. They had saved the world using ordinary people and their genius frazzled timey-wimey brain.
Looks like Rory and Davros both have a point; dangerous doesn't even begin to cover it.
That doesn't mean that it was the wrong thing to do, and we certainly can't know the repercussions of that decision until more of the season plays out, but it does give us an idea of how far the Doctor is now willing to go in order to protect us. Their sense of guilt seems to have been replaced with a new sense of purpose: this wasn't just a preliminary self-defense class, a can of pepper spray and a wish for good luck—he gave each of us a loaded gun and led us to the target. That's one overprotective parent and one heck of a moral stance for a pacifist.
I suppose we could always blame River Song's bad influence if we're feeling cheeky. Then again, at the rate he's going, who knows what the Doctor will have to do next time they encounter our here-again gone-again friends….

The House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed both the Justice Department and FBI for any information tied to Fusion GPS's dossier claims related to President Donald Trump and potential connections to Russia late Tuesday night. The committee will hold top Department of Justice and FBI officials accountable if it does not receive these documents.
According to The Associated Press, a Sept. 1 letter signed by Chairman Devin Nunes to the DOJ from the Committee stated it served the subpoenas to the bureau and Justice Department, but both had missed the initial Sept. 1 deadline, so a new deadline was set for Sept. 14.
Nunes had previously recused themselves from the investigation after being criticized for their relationship with the White House. Although Texas Republican Rep. Mike Conaway took over the chairperson role for the Russia matter according to the AP, they did not have the sign the letter.
The letter says the committee is looking for ways to force FBI Director Cristopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to publicly testify before Congress if the documents are not handed over.
“Resort to compulsory process was necessary because of DOJ's and FBI's insufficient responsiveness to the committee's numerous Russia-investigation related requests over the past several months,” the letter says.
If the committee cannot get hold of the documents or testimony, the committee “expressly reserves its right to proceed with any and all available legal options” according to Nunes, as well as a House vote to hold Sessions and Wray in contempt of Congress.

The company behind the GPD Win handheld gaming device have been making Android handhelds for years. But GPD's Win got a lot of attention because it's a Windows-powered handheld that can run PC games.
Now the company is planning to launch something new: a 7 inch laptop that's small enough to slide into your pocket.
It's called the GPD Pocket, and it's expected to support either Windows 10 or Ubuntu 16.04 Linux.
GPD is just showing off a few rendered images and mockup prototypes at this point, so we'll have to wait a while to see a final, working product. But the company expects the system's features to include:
7 inch IPS touchscreen display with Gorilla Glass 3
Intel Atom x7-Z8700 Cherry Trail processor
4GB of RAM
128GB of storage
7,000 mAh battery
The system is said to be slightly larger than the GPD Win, and it has an aluminum chassis. Pictures show a USB Type-C port, a full-sized USB port, an HDMI port, and a headset jack. And while the laptop is too small to fit a full-sized keyboard and touchpad, it does have a QWERTY keyboard and a ThinkPad-like pointing nub that you can use to move a mouse cursor on the screen, as well as left and right buttons for clicking.
The lack of palm rests could make typing kind of uncomfortable, but I doubt anyone would use this sort of device as their only PC anyway. Instead, it's a sort of portable laptop that can handle light-weight PC gaming duties on the go, but which you could also use to tap out a quick email, do some web browsing, or other activities that might not require a big screen or a high-power processor.
GPD sent me a demo unit of the GPD Win handheld to review last year, and I was pretty impressed with its performance… while it worked. But after a brief period the keyboard stopped working and I sent my review unit back to GPD.
I know I haven't been the only person to run into bugs with the GPD Win, so hopefully the company will take feedback from its first Windows handheld and apply it to the upcoming GPD Pocket to make a device that's more reliable.
According to ton-chi-ki, GPD plans to launch an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign for the GPD Pocket in February.
There's no word on the price or release date for the new model. But it looks like a promising device for folks lamenting the fact that major PC makers seem to have dropped out of the UMPC market in recent years.
thanks islisis!

Damaging ice storms continued their deadly march Sunday through the Midwest as winter storm watches and warnings stretched across much of the nation's storm-weary midsection.
At least six deaths have been blamed on a three-day siege of ice, sleet and freezing rain that has hobbled the region.
"Things could still be bad Monday," AccuWeather meteorologist Kristina Pydynowski told USA TODAY. "Parts of Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and all around the Chicago area. Thousands of power outages and of course definitely slippery travel."
"Expansive" ice storm warnings, freezing rain advisories and winter weather advisories had millions on edge Sunday from northeast New Mexico to the Upper Midwest, the National Weather Service reported. Many areas were blasted with a combination of snow and sleet.
The storm may have saved its most bitter fury for tiny Beaver, Okla., about 160 miles northeast of Amarillo, Texas. The little town was slammed with up to an inch of ice.
"This rates as just about the worst ice storm I've seen in the 47 years I've lived here," Mayor Kirk Fisher told USA TODAY. "Churches had to dismiss services. Power has been spotty on the east part of town. And tree damage is everywhere."
In Iowa, weather service meteorologist Andrew Ansorge said parts of the state could see two- to three-tenths of an inch of ice, about as thick as Time magazine, before the storm rolls out Monday. Southern Iowa could receive up to a quarter of an inch this weekend, which is closer to the thickness of a pen, Ansorge said.
"Safety is No. 1 during a unique storm like this," said Craig Bargfrede, winter operations administrator at the Iowa Department of Transportation. "This is one of those storms where we should pay attention to conditions and pay attention to media. If media advises 'Do not travel,' don't travel."
The governors of Oklahoma and Missouri declared states of emergency, and the National Guard was mobilized in Missouri and Kansas, where about 200 guardsmen patrolled key roads and helped stranded motorists.
In Kansas, two troopers were stopped at a crash on I-635 when a pickup driver slammed into their cars.
"Our Troopers are thankfully okay! PLEASE #MoveOver & # SlowDown ," tweeted Trooper Candice Breshears, spokesperson for the Kansas Highway Patrol.
Parts of Springfield, Mo., were still reeling from a round of "thunder ice" following lightning strikes amid a buildup of more than a quarter of an inch of ice on trees, fences and parked cars, the Springfield News-Leader reported. The relatively rare phenomenon, which only occurs in especially turbulent winter weather, was also reported as freezing rain fell in Joplin, Mo., the Associated Press reported.
At least three road deaths were blamed on the storm in Missouri, the State Highway Patrol said. Two others were reported in Kansas and one in Oklahoma.
In Kansas City, the NFL delayed the AFC divisional playoff game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Kansas City Chiefs, originally set for noon CT, more than seven hours to allow more time to treat roads and parking lots. Missouri Department of Transportation crews scrambled to ensure safe access to the game.
"Avoid travel if you can," MoDOT tweeted, adding a warning to "exercise caution today if traveling to the game."

A new study in China has found that people with higher levels of pesticide exposure are more likely to have suicidal thoughts. The study was carried out by Dr Robert Stewart from the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London together with scientists from Tongde Hospital Zhejiang Province.
The agricultural pesticides commonly used in China are organophosphates which are in wide use in many lower income countries but have been banned in many Western nations. It is well known that they are very dangerous if ingested as an overdose but there is also biological evidence that chronic low-grade exposure to these chemicals, which are very easily absorbed into the body through the skin and lungs, may have adverse effects on mental health. This study is the first epidemiological evidence to suggest possible effects on suicidal thoughts.
The study was carried out in central/coastal China, a relatively wealthy area with a rapidly developing economy. In a very large survey of mental health in rural community residents, participants were also asked about how they stored pesticides. The study found that people who stored pesticides at home, i.e. those with more exposure, were more likely to report recent suicidal thoughts. Supporting this, the survey also found suicidal thoughts to be associated with how easily accessible these pesticides were in the home and that the geographic areas with the highest home storage of pesticides also had the highest levels of suicidal thoughts in their populations.
Given the high level of pesticide exposure and the high suicide risk in rural China, clarification of the causal mechanisms underlying this association and the development of appropriate interventions should be priorities for public health and health policy.
Dr Robert Stewart comments: 'Organophosphate pesticides are widely used around the world although are banned in many countries because of their risk to health. They are particularly lethal chemicals when taken in overdose and are a cause of many suicides worldwide. Our research findings that suggest that higher exposure to these chemicals might actually increase the risk of suicidal thoughts provides further support for calls for tighter international restrictions on agricultural pesticide availability and use.'
Dr Jianmin Zhang, Associate Chief Psychiatrist, Tongde Hospital of Zhejiang Province, and Vice Director, Zhejiang Office of Mental Health, China added: 'The findings of this study suggested potential causal links and might partially account for the much higher incidence of suicide in rural than urban areas of China. However, further studies particularly with more precisely defined and assessed exposure are critically needed, as awareness of safer access to pesticides is important both to policy-makers and pesticide users.'

Notes to editors
Pesticide exposure and suicidal ideation in rural communities in Zhejiang province, China by Jianmin Zhang, Robert Stewart, Michael Phillips, Qichang Shi & Martin Prince was published in the October issue of the WHO Bulletin. The full article can be accessed on http://www. who. int/ bulletin/ volumes/ 87/ 10/ 08-054122. pdf .
The analysis involved data from a survey of a representative sample of 9,811 rural residents in Zhejiang province who had been asked about the storage of pesticides at home and about whether or not they had considered suicide within the two years before the interview. The Chinese version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was administered to screen for mental disorder.

The trial of three Al Jazeera English journalists in Egypt has been adjourned until March 5 after they appeared in court in Cairo and pleaded not guilty to all charges against them.
Mohamed Fahmy, Peter Greste and Baher Mohammed are accused of joining, or aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation.
After opening the trial, the Cairo court said it would hear prosecution witnesses and consider the evidence at the next hearing.
Al Jazeera continues to reject the charges and is demanding the immediate release of its staff.
Since their arrest, journalists have staged protests worldwide demanding their release, and rejecting claims the three have links to the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's former ruling party which has since been designated a "terrorist" group.
The case is one of many that have led to criticism of Egypt's military-backed government, with rights groups pointing to growing intolerance for dissent in the Arab world's most populous country.
"Journalists should not have to risk years in an Egyptian prison for doing their job," Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.
"The prosecution of these journalists for speaking with Muslim Brotherhood members, coming after the prosecution of protesters and academics, shows how fast the space for dissent in Egypt is evaporating."
Some of the charges levelled against the journalists carry prison sentences of five to 15 years.
'Deadly' for journalists
In total, nine journalists from the Qatar-based media network are among a group of 20 facing charges related to the case. The rest of the group have no connection to Al Jazeera.
Al Jazeera journalists Sue Turton and Dominic Kane, and Dutch journalist Rena Netjes - indicted though they do not work for the network - were tried in absentia.
The trial of the 20 journalists was adjourned to March 9.
The adjournment aims at giving defence lawyers time to examine the case documents, according to the court.
Another Al Jazeera journalist, Abdullah al-Shami of the network's Arabic channel, has been held since August. They have been on hunger strike for more than a month to protest their imprisonment.
In 2013, the Committee to Protect Journalists ranked Egypt the world's third deadliest country for journalists. At least five journalists were killed and 45 assaulted last year, according to CPJ. Security forces raided at least 11 news outlets that year.
Greste, an award-winning journalist who has worked for the BBC and Reuters, has written letters from prison, one of which described what they see as a lack of press freedom in Egypt.
As coverage of last week's flare-up between Bob Woodward and the White House devolved into the granular parsing of words and implications and extrapolations and possible intent, the larger point was roundly missed: the increasing pressure that White House correspondents feel when dealing with the Obama administration — to follow their narrative, to be properly deferential (!), to react to push-back by politely sitting down and shutting up.
“The whole Woodward thing doesn't surprise me at all,” says David Brody, chief political correspondent for CBN News. “I can tell you categorically that there's always been, right from the get-go of this administration, an overzealous sensitivity to any push-back from any media outlet.”
A brief recap: After the Washington Post ran a Woodward op-ed in which they claimed that the administration was “moving the goalposts” on the eve of the potential sequester, the veteran journalist went on to assert that economic adviser Gene Sperling said, in an e-mail, “I think you will regret staking out this claim.”
While Woodward spent a lot of the week on cable news going back and forth on whether that was a threat, few reporters, if any, asked why a high-level administration official spent so much time — Sperling admittedly shouted at Woodward during a 30-minute phone call, followed by that e-mail — attempting to control an opinion expressed in a newspaper.
The answer, say former and current White House correspondents, is simple: This administration is more skilled and disciplined than any other in controlling the narrative, using social media to circumnavigate the press. On the flip side, our YouTube culture means even the slightest gaffe can be devastating, and so you have an army of aides and staffers helicoptering over reporters.
Finally, this week, reporters are pushing back. Even Jonathan Alter — who frequently appears on the Obama-friendly MSNBC — came forward to say he, too, had been treated horribly by the administration for writing something they didn't like.
“There is a kind of threatening tone that, from time to time — not all the time — comes out of these guys,” Alter said this week. During the 2008 campaign swing through Berlin, Alter said that future White House press secretary Robert Gibbs disinvited them from a dinner between Obama and the press corps over it.
“I was told ‘Don't come,' in a fairly abusive e-mail,” they said. “[It] made what Gene Sperling wrote [to Woodward] look like patty-cake.”
“I had a young reporter asking tough, important questions of an Obama Cabinet secretary,” says one DC veteran. “She was doing their job, and they were trying to bully them In an e-mail, they called them the vilest names — bitch, c–t, a–hole.” They complained and was told the matter would be investigated: “They were hemming and hawing, saying, ‘We'll look into it.' Nothing happened.”
They wound up confronting the author of the e-mail directly. “I said, ‘From now on, every e-mail you send this reporter will be on the record, and you will be speaking on behalf of the president of the United States.' That shut it down.”
Neil Munro, White House correspondent for the conservative Daily Caller, says that after they interrupted Obama during a June 2012 press conference on immigration — inadvertently, Munro insists — they felt the wrath of the administration. “The White House called and bitched us out vigorously,” they say. “I haven't been called on since shortly after Osama bin Laden was killed.”
“I've seen reporters get abused — but it's the job of the press to push back hard,” says Ron Fournier, a White House correspondent under Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. “The people you're covering don't feel like they should be challenged, and they have immense resources at their disposal to beat back.”
CBN's Brody, who covered Obama during the 2008 campaign and was granted four one-on-ones, has emotional whiplash from their treatment by top aides. On the one hand, he's sympathetic: “I think they believe in a rabid defense of this president, who has had so many critics, at all costs,” they say. On the other, they are often bullies and a favored tactic is to make a journalist feel dumb, unsophisticated, unworthy of the job or the briefing room or the returned call.
“The way they treated Woodward,” says Munro, “is the way they treat other reporters.”
One correspondent says that when they inquired about a staging choice for the president's speech, they were steamrolled. “There was one specific White House aide calling me up, yelling and screaming,” they say. “It was condescending and abrasive: ‘Why is this a story? Why are you doing this? This is of no consequence. You're making a mountain out of a molehill.'”
This went on for two days. “All I wanted,” says the reporter, “was an answer to a question. It's not like I was looking to do a 12-page exposé to take down an aide. It was unnecessary vociferousness.” They eventually got their statement.
Another White House correspondent says that last week's blowup over pool reporters' access to the president's golf game with Tiger Woods — which was none — is indicative of a larger problem. “Today's a perfect example,” they say. “Jack Lew is sworn in” — as US Treasury secretary, on Thursday — “and they didn't even allow a photographer in there. A reporter asked [press secretary] Jay Carney why, and their answer was, ‘It's a family ceremony.' No! This is a high-ranking government official whose salary is paid for by taxpayers. No.”
“This administration has tools to reach people on their own,” CBS White House correspondent Bill Plante said this week. “They don't need us as much. And to the extent that they're able to do that, they're undercutting the First Amendment, which guarantees a free press through many voices. If they put out their own material, it's state-run media.”
Meanwhile, the increasingly obsequious Steve Kroft at “60 Minutes” has had more access to the president than any other reporter, and their last sitdown — with Obama and outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton — was less a scrupulous exit interview than an infomercial for Hillary 2016. Kroft kicked off things by making it clear they had been summoned: “This is not an interview I ever expected to be doing,” Kroft said. “But I understand, Mr. President, this was your idea. Why did you want to do this together, a joint interview?”
“These are the two most influential foreign-policy officials in the United States,” wrote The Atlantic's Conor Friedersdorf. “In the last four years, they've presided over hugely consequential policies all over the planet, much of it cloaked in secrecy.” They went on to excoriate Kroft's soft-balling as “an embarrassing failure.”
None of the White House correspondents who spoke to The Post are hopeful that things will improve. “What's our recourse?” says one. “How do you force them?”
“The reporters I've spoken to who have covered multiple administrations have said this is tighter, more restricted than other administrations,” Munro says. “They don't like it. They don't have the power to change it.”
For these reasons especially, Fournier is nostalgic for the days of covering Bill Clinton. “Every five or six days, he'd do a public event, and we'd go and yell questions and occasionally, they would answer,” Fournier says. “He had to be accountable to an–hole like me. That's healthy for democracy.”

Ottawa police have ended their water search for missing 67-year-old Jehangir Balsara, whose vehicle was found late Thursday on Bate Island, halfway between Ottawa and Gatineau.

Balsara disappeared on Monday afternoon. Their vehicle was found on Bate Island — halfway across the Champlain Bridge between Ottawa and Gatineau— after police received information about it at about 9:30 p.m. Thursday.
Officers searched the area for a short time Thursday night but halted the work until daybreak Friday.
Police search crews arrived just before 8:30 a.m. Friday to perform a ground and shoreline search. Eventually, crews entered the chilly waters of the Ottawa River.
The water search ended Friday afternoon.
Man said he'd be home in 10 minutes
Balsara left their Kanata home on Monday, according to a family member, and they were reached on the phone while out. They had said they were going to return home within 10 minutes, but never made it.
Balsara, a self-employed accountant, is described as an East Indian man, standing about six feet one inch tall with a heavier build. They have balding hair with a salt-and-pepper colour.
Police said they were last seen wearing a blue dress shirt, dark coloured pants and a blue windbreaker with a sailboat logo on the left breast of the jacket.
Balsara's family said this is out of character and that they do not suffer from health problems. They also said there has been no activity on their bank card and that their cellphone goes straight to voicemail.
Balsara's daughter-in-law, Andrea Simms-Karp, said Friday the family had not been contacted about the vehicle. They only learned of it through the news.
Body found in Ottawa River by Gatineau police
At about 3:30 p.m. Friday, Gatineau police discovered a body in the Ottawa River near Jacques Cartier Park.
Ottawa police said they're aware of the discovery, and that the missing persons unit is looking into whether it's connected to Balsara's disappearance.
Anyone with information is asked to contact the Ottawa police missing persons unit at 613-236-1222, ext. 2355, or Crime Stoppers at 613-233-8477.
Xcode Server is Continuous Integration service provide by Apple to analyse, build, test and archive iOS apps. Xcode Server has been recently inbuilt with Xcode 9, which made Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery of iOS apps just a few clicks away. Apple still hasn't updated documentation of Xcode Server a.k.a XCS with Xcode 9 at the time of writing this post but in my earlier post, I have explained how to setup Xcode Server with Xcode 9 for iOS apps. Many XCS users have complained that Xcode Server lacks third-party integrations but I don't think that true. XCS has provided the ability to write pre-integration and post-integration scripts to integrate with any possible third-party services. We just need to understand the API's provided by Xcode Server and third-party services. In this post, we will see how to integrate Xcode Server with incredibly popular communication service Slack.
Why Slack Integration
Slack has become one of the most popular collaborative tools for most of the companies. Almost everyone loves Slack because of its slickness and awesome features. There is hardly any organization where you don't see Slack unless they are Slack competitors. Slack is being used as communication channel within the organization for collaborative working. Slack has some amazing features like workspace, channels, bots, webhooks and many more. Slack notification can be used for providing the feedback for development activities like static analysis, code issues, test reporting, and deployments. The most Continuous Integration Servers are adding the Slack integration to give updates on deployments pipelines. In the world of iOS, we can use Fastlane Slack action to report the status of the iOS development activities. Xcode Server is developed by Apple so there won't be any inbuilt support unless there is business level communication but we can easily integrate the with Slack using the combination of Slack API and Xcode Server post-integration script.
Know XCS Environmental Variables
The first step in order to integrate the Slack with Xcode Server is to understand the Xcode Server environment variables that we can use in the script. There is the list of the environmental variables available to use for Xcode Server but we will see some of the useful ones that we need for Slack integration.
XCS_BOT _ NAME : This can be used anywhere in the script to get the current Xcode Bot name.
: This can be used anywhere in the script to get the current Xcode Bot name. XCS_INTEGRATION_RESULT : It provides the results of the integration.
: It provides the results of the integration. XCS_PRIMARY_REPO_DIR : This provides the source code of the integration from where we can extract information like Git last commit or authors.
: This provides the source code of the integration from where we can extract information like Git last commit or authors. XCS_PRIMARY_REPO_BRANCH : It provides the branch names of the current integration.
There are many other variables that you can benefit from but for now, we will use only mentioned above.
Prepare Slack for XCS Integration
Now that, we know the Xcode Server environmental variables to be used within our script. Let's now prepare our Slack for the Xcode Server integrations. There are few things we need to do before we actually start writing the integration script.
Create Incoming WebHook
We need to create incoming webhook in the Slack which we can use to post the messages to the particular channel. There is a clear documentation on how to setup incoming webhook so there is no need to repeat here but we will see how it looks like in the practice.
Visit the Incoming WebHook page and click on add configuration.
Now, select the channel your Incoming WebHook will post messages to in my case, I have selected #xcblog channel that I have created for demo purpose.
Click Add Incoming WebHooks Integration and Save Setting
Now that, we have a WebHook URL as shown above that we can use to post the message to the channel. Our Slack is now ready to accept messages from Xcode Server.
Explore Slack API
Now that, we have setup our incoming webhook, let's send some test messages to the channel using the Slack API for the incoming WebHooks. you can find comprehensive documentation on a Slack official page here how to send the simple to rich text messages using Slack API. In summary, we can use JSON payload to post sample message to Slack using WebHook
$ curl -X POST \ -H 'Content-type: application/json' \ --data '{"text": "This is posted to #xcblog and comes from *Xcode-bot*.", "channel": "#xcblog", "link_names": 1, "username": "xcode-bot", "icon_emoji": ":robot_face:"}' \ https://hooks.slack.com/services/your_incoming_webhook_url 1 2 3 4 $ curl - X POST \ - H 'Content-type: application/json' \ -- data '{"text": "This is posted to #xcblog and comes from *Xcode-bot*.", "channel": "#xcblog", "link_names": 1, "username": "xcode-bot", "icon_emoji": ":robot_face:"}' \ https : / / hooks .slack .com / services / your_incoming_webhook_url
This will post sample message which will look like this on the channel.
This works but we are not that boring. Let's make it more interactive and give more information to users.
Use Slack Attachments
Slack attachments can be used to add extra information and more context to the messages. With the use of Attachments, message become more attractive, useful and informative. We can use attachments to create following things
Title and Links
Multiple fields
Different color
pretext, author etc
There is more information about attachments on the Slack official website here, please feel free to have a look to know more about Slack attachments. We can use attachments to post the interactive and rich message from Xcode Server.
Add Post-Integration Script to XCS Bot
We have just finished Slack setup, it's time to write a script that can be triggered after the Xcode Server finishes Xcode Bot Integration.
Configure Message Content
We would like to see an attractive message when Xcode Server finishes the integration. Let start to think of content that we want to post on the Slack.
Determine Slack attachments colour depending on Xcode Bot integration result
Get the latest git message
Check if product is archived and provide link to download build on iOS devices if archived
Provide test summary e.g error count an warning count
This is the small list but you can go beyond this and configure more things in the Slack attachments. We can easily create bash script by using the Xcode Server environment variables and Slack API to satisfy above requirements. The Script will look like this:

Replace the value of variables for Xcode Server Url, Slack Channel and incoming WebHook with your details. Now that, we have a script ready and we can execute this script as part of Xcode Bot post-integration triggers while creating or editing the bots.
That's it! We have now successfully configured Xcode Server Bots with Slack. Let's trigger integration and watch the results in the Slack channel. The end result will look like this:
You can see that we have loads of information posted on the Slack for the Xcode Server integration. It looks simply amazing!
Celebrate iOS Deployments on Slack
We have just seen an example of the test integration where we are just running the test and posting messages. When we do deployments to iTunes Connects we can create more creative messages and celebrate the success!
Watch Live Action
Watch the recorded live action of Slack and Xcode Server.
Using Fastlane Slack Action
We can achieve the same results using the Fastlane Slack Action. There is example code on the page to configure the attachments properties and JSON payload. If you are currently using Fastlane then it would be a good idea to configure a lane with Fastlane and execute it as part of the post-integration action. In our case, we can configure slack action

We have to define the Xcode Server variables in the lane and we could achieve same results.
Conclusion
Slack is being the great communication tool in the world of DevOps and Continuous Delivery. It can play the very important role in providing the faster feedback from Continuous Integration servers. We can apply the Slack integration to iOS Development world by configuring it with Apple's own CI server. Hope you will find this post useful, I can't wait to see all of you starts using Slack and Xcode Server combination to celebrate successes!
Senate Passes Budget That Would Fund Government Into 2017
Enlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP
The Senate passed a bill at 3:12 a.m. ET Friday that would raise the debt ceiling and fund the government into 2017. This means that there would be no fiscal standoffs and threats of government shutdown for more than a year.
The measure is now on its way to the White House for President Obama's signature, NPR's Ailsa Chang reports for the Newscast unit:
"For months, there was real concern the looming Nov. 3 deadline to lift the debt ceiling was going to send Congress into crisis mode, right when it was picking a new speaker of the House. "But now Congress has days to spare, having passed a budget agreement that raises the debt ceiling until March 2017. The deal also increases federal spending by $80 billion over the next two years — splitting that amount evenly between defense and domestic programs. "The agreement was negotiated by former Speaker John Boehner, three other congressional leaders and the White House. The newly elected speaker, Paul Ryan, supported the deal but says he'll ensure a more inclusive process next time important legislation is at stake."
As we reported earlier this week, the package also includes provisions that delay a hike in Medicare premiums, sell oil from the emergency reserve to offset spending, and shift Social Security money around.
In times past some of us have recited what has been known as the "Apostles Creed" as a declaration of our faith. I have no interest in reviving this practice or writing an addendum to this document. But, I do want you to see that the very heart of the gospel is no where to be found in the content of this popular creed. The reason that everyone from Roman Catholics to reformed Presbyterians can agree with the statements contained in it is because the offense of the gospel is completely absent. Someone might ask; "Isn't this what Christians believe?" My answer is yes... but oh, we believe so much more. As is usually the case, the problem is not with what is said, the problem is with what is not said. Read it, you'll see what I mean.
"I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, Their only Son, our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. The third day They rose again from the dead, They ascended into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty, from thence They shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost, the universal church, the communion of the saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting."
We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ fully and finally accomplished redemption for all of God's elect when They died on the cross of Calvary. We believe that when They died as our Substitute under the wrath of God that They fully and finally satisfied Divine justice by paying the sin debt and thereby secured salvation for all for whom They died. We believe that Christ through the Holy Spirit will also succeed in effectually calling and bringing all that They died for with Him into everlasting Glory. We believe that any gospel that robs our Lord of this, Their glory in the finished, successful, accomplished work of salvation, is another gospel.... which is no gospel at all. Now, there's the real offense and power of the gospel. Do you believe that?
Wildlife
The saola is the largest terrestrial mammal never seen alive in the wild by a biologist. This is not a Bigfoot story. The saola undeniably exists. It roams only in the Annamite Mountains of Laos and Vietnam.
Biologists know very little about the saola. But one thing is clear: They are in big trouble. A poaching crisis in the Annamite Mountains is hammering wildlife, and a rare species like saola stands little chance in a landscape literally covered in snares.
But how do conservationists protect a species that scientists have not even seen in its native habitat? The challenge is monumental. It is, essentially, trying to save a unicorn.
The Remarkable Story of the Saola
Bill Robichaud, is one of the world's experts on saola. At a lecture they gave at Zoo Boise – a funder of saola conservation – they began by attesting that being a saola expert should come with a bit of qualification.
“This could be a short talk,” they said. “We do not know much. There are no dumb questions when it comes to saola.”
But what is known is astonishing enough. In 1992, a joint biological expedition by the Vietnam Ministry of Forestry and the World Wide Fund for Nature conducted a survey in the Annamite Mountains, a global biodiversity hotspot. When a biologist visited a local village to pick up vegetables, they noticed horns hanging in a hunter's house of an animal they didn't recognize.
It proved not only to be a new species but a new genus. While it looks superficially like an antelope or perhaps a wild ox, there really are no comparisons. “This is not like a new species of deer or new species of wild goat. The saola was something entirely new,” says Robichaud, who works for the organization Global Wildlife Conservation and now heads the IUCN's Saola Working Group.
The Annamite Mountains proved to be a biological treasure trove, with other major wildlife discoveries including the bare-faced bulbul, large-antlered muntjac and Annamite striped rabbit. “The saola is the most spectacular chapter of what is a remarkable story,” says Robichaud.
And the saola chapter has continued. They have since been documented on camera traps. One has been seen alive by outside biologists, but it was captured by a hunter and confined to a general's menagerie. Robichaud, who has now made significant expeditions to the Annamites, was able to spend time with that animal, but unfortunately it died after only 18 days in captivity.
“It was as tame as a domestic pig or goat,” they say. “It was wary of humans but never really got upset.”
Most of the information on saola has been gathered from information from local villagers and hunters. Even locals only rarely see them, and then typically when the animal is bayed by dogs. It is a solitary forest browser, and does not bother village gardens.
Population estimates vary from 30 to 300 animals, but it's clear that the animal is in serious trouble. And there is a conservation crisis in the Annamites. “Tigers, elephants and giant pandas get a lot of conservation attention, as they should,” says Robichaud. “But the saola faces far greater risks. There is a scarcity of conservation attention, and this is a large mammal that is genetically distinct.”
From Bombs to Snares: Saola Under Siege
Biologists don't know how common saola once were, but as with many wildlife species in Southeast Asia, its populations likely suffered greatly during the Vietnam War. During the conflict, Laos became the most bombed country per capita in human history; more bombs rained down on it than on all of Europe during World War II.
This, coupled with defoliation by Agent Orange, likely directly killed saola and fragmented its habitat. Where the distribution of saola is the most patchy correlates to areas with the heaviest bombing.
Today, the saola faces a seemingly low-tech threat: snares. A mind boggling number of snares. Hundreds of thousands of wire traps strung across the Annamite Mountains.
“This is not local people hunting for food,” says Robichaud. “It is poaching for the Chinese medicinal trade and high-end bushmeat restaurants. The demand for anything valued for traditional medicine or meat has stimulated a catastrophe.”
A tiger can fetch $10,000 on the market, a golden coin turtle upwards of $20,000.
But the saola? Zero. Since they never existed in China or outside the Annamites, they play no role in traditional medicine.
But snares are indiscriminate killers; in some forest areas, nearly every conceivable path is blocked with a trap. “On the one hand, this is incredibly sad. Saola are bycatch, like dolphins in tuna nets,” they say. “But on the other hand, poachers are not racing us to get the last saola like they are tigers and rhinos.”
Silver Linings
Unlike many wildlife conservation stories, this is not a habitat issue. There is still plenty of forest in Laos. While poaching is a difficult problem to tackle, villagers have been huge allies.
“Engaging villagers in saola conservation is very easy,” says Robichaud. “They don't even eat their crops. People are very open to the message.”
Many villagers are now taking pride in this endemic animal. Robichaud tells the story of a hunter who asks them about how many saola are in the United States, with all its conservation programs, or Africa, with its great herds. “When I told them they are not even found in Thailand, not even found in other parts of Laos, you could see the realization,” Robichaud says. “Later I heard that they their dogs had bayed a saola and they chose not to kill it.”
With the leadership of local people and support from zoos and other organizations, a massive snare collection effort is underway. More than 130,000 snares have been collected and destroyed at five key sites since 2011. “When you collect that many snares, you're helping a lot of other wildlife, too,” they say.
Robichaud visited Zoo Boise to meet with Zoo Teens, a group of young people who volunteer at the zoo and raise money for conservation programs. Their focus has been on funding snare removal in the Annamites. (Full disclosure: my wife works for Zoo Boise).
“Having young people raise awareness and fund our efforts makes a huge difference,” says Robichaud. “People don't know about the saola. It faces daunting challenges. But it is a challenge where we can make a difference.”
In Balwyn, the government-run Balwyn Primary gets $7214 of government funds per student, while down the road the privately run St Bede's Parish Primary gets $7974, plus what it charges parents. The alleged incident unfolded in Sydney's south-west on Wednesday. In Preston, Newlands Primary gets $10,362 but Sacred Heart gets $11,488. In Spotswood, Spotswood Primary gets $8008 while St Margaret Mary's gets $11397. In Ballarat, Ballarat North Primary gets $8158 while St Patrick's gets $8499. That's by no means a complete list, and the schools I have mentioned are roughly matched for size and socio-economic status. Right now, on average, Catholic and independent private schools get less per student than government schools, but if present trends continue they'll overtake government schools in four years. An analysis by a former president of the NSW Secondary Principals Council, Chris Bonnor, and education researcher Bernie Shepherd entitled Private School, Public Cost finds that by 2020 the typical Catholic student will receive $850 more than the typical government student, and the typical independent student $100 more.
It'll lend an entirely different meaning to the word "independent" and bury for good the argument that parents who pay extra to send their children to private schools are doing other taxpayers a favour. So dependent are private schools already that 95 per cent get more in government grants than they spend on teachers' salaries. They either raise very little extra from parents (typically the case for Catholic schools) or raise a lot more and use it for facilities that are the envy of their public school neighbours. It began quietly. For more than 100 years until the mid-1960s Australia treated private schools the same way as did other developed countries. It didn't fund them. Then prime minister Menzies broke the ice with grants for science labs and prime minister Whitlam with general grants linked to the achievement of targets. Prime Minister Howard turbocharged the process with a new formula that took no account of the money private schools got from other sources and a new kind of grant – for the establishment of new private schools.
In the space of a decade Australia gained an extra 127 private schools, some very small, and all entitled to establishment grants and ongoing public support. So dependent are private schools already that 95 per cent get more in government grants than they spend on teachers' salaries. Julia Gillard's 2011 Gonski review found a mess. "When considered holistically, the current funding arrangements for schooling are unnecessarily complex, lack coherence and transparency, and involve a duplication of funding," it reported. It recommended instead a "colourblind" approach. Every student would be entitled to the same amount of money, adjusted for need. In public schools it would all be provided by governments, state and federal. Private schools attended by students from poor socio-economic backgrounds would be told to find 10 per cent themselves. Private schools attended by students from good backgrounds would have to find 75 to 85 per cent. The one big problem was that Gillard had decreed that "no school will lose a dollar". It made Gonski expensive.
But after initially causing mischief (his education spokesperson Christopher Pyne labelled the idea "Conski") Tony Abbott promised a "unity ticket". They would honour Labor's agreements with the states for at least four years, even though they lasted for six years. After their election it was quickly forgotten. The money was forthcoming, for four years only, but the requirement for the states to put in their share and divide it in accordance with Gonski formula was dropped. Labor had made it hard for him, even if they had had the best will in the world. First it had insisted that no school be worse off, hugely inflating the Gonski's cost, and then, because it couldn't work out how to fund that cost, it pushed all but $3 billion of the $9.7 billion out into the final two years of the agreements, where it wouldn't show up in the budget's forward estimates. Uncertain of what to do as those final two years approached, Malcolm Turnbull at first suggested the Commonwealth abandon schools funding, leaving it all to the states, which would raise their own income tax, except for private schools, which for some reason they would continue to fund. Then they threw them an extra bag of money to buy a few years more time. As the election approaches, Labor is talking again about funding the full Gonski, the expensive one where private schools don't lose a dollar. I'd hoped for more, but then I've yet to meet a Labor MP whose children aren't in private schools.
The Coalition seems not to have a policy at all, at least not yet. Unless one of the parties develops a policy that's actually thought through, we're likely to drift into the next election with private schools more heavily government-funded than government schools and no-one thinking its at all unusual.
Yesterday El Salvador's Supreme Court ruled against allowing a 22-year-old mother to have an abortion that would save their lives and terminate the pregnancy of the fetus they have growing inside them Doctors have determined the fetus has anencephaly, a birth defect in which parts of the brain and skull are missing. Beatriz, as they are known as, also suffers from lupus, and complications from their pregnancy which is now at 26 weeks will continue until they give birth to the infant that will die after it is born. Due to carrying their pregnancy to term, Beatriz will probably also die. And there is nothing we can do about it. From The New York Times:
In the ruling, the court cited doctors as saying that “an eventual interruption of the pregnancy would not imply, much less have as an objective, the destruction of the fetus.” Beatriz's lawyer, however, described the ruling as “misogynistic” because it placed the rights of a fetus with little chance of surviving after birth over the welfare of a sick woman who already has an infant boy to care for. “The court placed the life of the anencephalic baby over Beatriz's life,” said Víctor Hugo Mata, one of their lawyers, speaking by phone from the Supreme Court. “Justice here does not respect the rights of women.” Last month, a group of doctors overseeing Beatriz's care at the National Maternity Hospital sent a report to the Health Ministry arguing that as the pregnancy progressed, the risk of hemorrhaging, kidney failure and maternal death would increase.
Beatriz is a mother of one. Not only will they probably die, their infant will only live a few hours, and they will be leaving a child motherless. El Salvador has some of the strictest anti-abortion laws in Latin America, and doesn't even allow abortion in cases or rape or incest. If doctors were to intervene and perform the abortion that would save Beatriz's life, they would face criminal charges. Women who undergo abortions in El Salvador face up to 30 years in prison for aggravated homicide. Beatriz could possibly obtain a special humanitarian visa and travel to the United States to have an abortion, but their doctors say the trip would pose too many health risks. Every day that they remain pregnant is putting their lives in jeopardy. Them infant has no chance of survival beyond a few hours, and this pregnancy will kill them There is a petition asking Pope Francis to intervene on Change.org, and I signed it knowing that it won't do a bit of good anyway.
This decision doesn't protect the sanctity of life. If abortion is murder, then what is forcing a woman to go to term with a baby that will die anyway and a pregnancy that will kill them in any way pro-life?

Unless the level of greenhouse gases emissions is reduced substantially, there could be “far-reaching and largely irreversible impacts” on ocean life that would hit developing nations, especially hard, a team of scientists warned on Friday.
A research team from the Ocean 2015 Initiative, which is tasked with providing information and recommendations for the nations attending the COP21 international climate conference in Paris this December, called for major changes to human industrial activity in order to prevent irreparable damage to the planet's ecosystem. The team made the recommendations after conducting a review study, published Friday in the journal Science.
"To date, the oceans have essentially been the planet's refrigerator and carbon dioxide storage locker. For instance, since the 1970s they've absorbed roughly 93 percent of the additional heat produced by the greenhouse effect, greatly helping to slow the warming of our planet," Hans-Otto Pörtner, a researcher at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in Germany and the study's co-author, said in a press release.
But the authors warned that the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has risen from 278 parts per million to 400 parts per million, an increase of 40 percent. Temperatures are rising even at the deepest and the most remote parts of the ocean, which has triggered the mass migration of some species up to 250 miles closer to the planet's poles, while acidification threatened corals and bivalves in many regions of Earth.
For their study, the research team considered two possible scenarios for global emissions -- one, where the rise in global temperatures is limited to 2 degrees Celsius, an internationally agreed target for the safe limit, and another “business as usual” scenario where the temperature will continue rising unchecked.
"If we can successfully limit the rise in air temperature to two degrees Celsius through the year 2100, the risks, especially for warm-water corals and bivalves in low to middle latitudes, will become critical. However, the remaining risks will remain fairly moderate," lead author Jean-Pierre Gattuso said.
The second scenario assumes that carbon dioxide emissions would remain at their 2013 level of 36 billion tons per year. The researchers warned that if this were allowed to continue, it would affect every area of human activity such as fisheries, tourism and coastal protection against weather events.
"If we just go on with business as usual, by the end of this century the changes will hit nearly every ecosystem in the oceans and cause irreparable harm for marine life," Pörtner said.
Like never before, the world was touched by the stories of LGBTI people in 2013.
This year saw more LGBTI stories and moments going viral, issues of interest only to the community suddenly becoming mainstream.
It wasn't just LGBTI people who wanted to read heartwarming letters of a proud dad to their gay son. It wasn't just LGBTI people who wanted to watch kids reacting to the idea of marriage equality. And it certainly wasn't just LGBTI people who listened and loved to a proud straight grandma who wrote a song for their lesbian niece.
If the winter nights are freezing, these stories might warm your heart.
1. Kids reacting to gay marriage will warm your heart
In November, Fine Bros, a company specializing in creating memes and videos of children reacting in funny ways put out a video of 13 children reacting to gay marriage.
The children were then asked their opinion on LGBTI rights, and the results were amazing.
It soon went viral, with the video receieving over 10 million views.
2. Columnist gives perfect response to anti-gay parent
Advice columnist Amy Dickinson delivered a witty response to a letter from a homophobic parent who asked their advice on how to get their son to ‘stop' being gay.
Here it is below:
Dear Betrayed:
You could teach your son an important lesson by changing your sexuality to show them how easy it is.
Try it for the next year or so: Stop being a heterosexual to demonstrate to your son that a person's sexuality is a matter of choice – to be dictated by one's parents, the parents' church and social pressure.
I assume that my suggestion will evoke a reaction that your sexuality is at the core of who you are. The same is true for your son. They have a right to be accepted by their parents for being exactly who they are.
When you ‘forget' a child's birthday, you are basically negating them as a person. It is as if you are saying that you have forgotten their presence in the world. How very sad for him.
Pressuring your son to change their sexuality is wrong.
If you cannot learn to accept them as they are, it might be safest for them to live elsewhere.
A group that could help you and your family figure out how to navigate this is PFLAG.org. This organization is founded for parents, families, friends and allies of LGBT people, and has helped countless families through this challenge. Please research and connect with a local chapter.

3. Grandfather disowns daughter after daughter disowns gay son
A letter from a disgruntled man to their daughter who had disowned their gay son emerged in October and the fierce letter was heart warming to see. The man, disappointed with their daughter was strong and a beautiful response to the prejudice some people still hold.
4. Transgender student crowned home coming queen
Transgender student Cassidy Lynn Campbell made history on Friday 20 September when they were crowned homecoming queen of Marina High School in Huntington Beach, California.
Campbell wants to now become an LGBT activist and has this message for other transgender teens: ‘Just to be true to themselves and to let people know around them and to not keep it bottled up inside.'
5. Frat brothers helping to raise money to pay for transgender surgery
Early in the year a story emerged about a Donnie Collins, a transgender student at Emerson College whose health insurance wouldn't cover their gender reassignment surgerty.
The Phi Alpha Tau fraternity decided to help Collins raise the money by posting a video on youtube and setting up a donation page on crowdfunding website Indiegogo.
The response was phenomenal and the brotherhood raised 5 times the amount Collins needed for the surgery.
Once the story went viral the insurance company decided to pay a part of the surgery. Collins posted an emotional thank-you response on Youtube and the excess money was donated to charity. A great story all round.
6. Dad overhears son and saves them trouble of coming out
Letters going viral have made some of the best stories this year and one of the the best and simplest was from an understanding father saving their son the trauma of having to come out to their parents. The letter, simple but lovely, really is heart-warming.
Nate,
I overheard your phone conversation with Mike last night about your plans to come out to me. The only thing I need you to plan is to bring home OJ and bread after class.
We are out, like you now.
I've known you were gay since you were six, I've loved you since you were born.
– Dad
PS Your mom and I think you and Mike make a cute couple.
7. Australian film explores gay love at high school
The Australian theatre for young people in Sydney made a touching short-film about first love between two boys at school. The film, which got over 450,000 hits on YouTube, starred 17-year-old Kim Cho and is entitled the ‘Language of Love.'
The idea for film was conceived when Cho had a moment of inspiration while sitting in a French Exam.
8. Grandma writes love song for lesbian niece's wedding
In May, a Tennessee grandma of eight decided to write a love song for their lesbian niece's wedding called What If We Are Just Like You?
‘I'm not an activist, but I get goddamn mad by narrow-mindedness and prejudice and crazy stuff,' Sherri Gray told Gay Star News.
‘We [religious people] are not all crazy, we're not all nutjobs, and we don't hate all LGBT people.'
Since their song featured on the website, going viral, their life has completely changed.

Labour leader says they expect there will be a general election in next 12 months which they will probably win
Jeremy Corbyn has said they are horrified by the sexual harassment allegations in Westminster and some claims the Labour party has received have been disturbing.
In an interview with the magazine Grazia, Corbyn said there would be a general election in the next 12 months, which Labour “will probably win”, and that they were “ready to be prime minister tomorrow”.
On the sexual harassment claims that have seen a string of MPs from all parties suspended or placed under investigation after the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the #metoo movement, Corbyn said they had “not [heard] many whispers” about inappropriate behaviour prior to this and had been shocked by the allegations.
They said: “I'm horrified and appalled by it all. I think sexism is a real challenge in society that needs to be dealt with. The allegations are all investigated and dealt with as appropriate. We support the people making them as well as the people being alleged against.”
Corbyn said Labour was “not dealing with huge numbers” of allegations but added: “We're dealing with some cases and they are of course disturbing when you get them.
“But we have a process, including a confidential hotline and an independent person to investigate. I'm utterly determined all Labour party events will be a safe place for women to go to.”
When asked about Brexit and why their party were not campaigning to reverse the decision in a second referendum, they said that some people had been “extremely irresponsible in what they did and said” in the campaign but “we have to recognise it was the largest participation of people in an electoral process ever in Britain and they chose to leave”.
Corbyn has been facing pressure to spell out in more detail what Brexit settlement Labour would support and Theresa May repeatedly ribbed them over what they said was Labour's ambiguous position in the House of Commons last week.
They said their priority was ensuring there was enough time for a smooth transition: “I think we should continue putting pressure on the government to allow a transition period to develop, because at the moment we're in danger of getting into a complete mess in March 2019.”
On Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding, Corbyn – known for their republican beliefs – said “she's clearly a very decent person”.
They added: “Weddings come pretty pricey, I understand, but I think the cost should be borne by the family themselves.”
Asked what trait they most deplores in himself, they said untidiness.

The mammalian skeleton is a marvel of nature. Here, Ben Garrod, who presents the series Secrets of Bones on BBC Four, explains how a basic template has been adapted in different ways to some enable extraordinary animal behaviour.
It's late and I'm sat at my desk, pen to paper; I'm a bit 'old school' and therefore write everything down before typing it all up.
And it's here that the wonder of the skeleton strikes me once again. Whilst doodling away in the edge of the page, I look at my hand . . . and think about the 27 individual bones that make up my hand and wrist, all delicately working together to allow the precision grip on my old fountain pen.
Each bone is uniquely shaped and perfectly adapted to fit snugly with its neighbouring counterpart.
Delicate enough to hold a pen, yet strong enough to climb a mountain (if I really wanted to); these little bones are a perfect example of the wonder of the skeleton.
Most of us know that newborns have a delicate area of skin on the top of the head (the "fontanelle"), where the delicate skull bones are yet to fully fuse. But less well known is that a tiny baby has a bundle of between 275 - 300 bones, which will eventually fall to the 206 found in adults.
Where do they go? Well, they fuse, often incorporating several tiny bony pieces into one bone. Even our femur (the thigh bone); the strongest bone in the human body, doesn't start off as a single bone.
Bones are amazing, bones are undoubtedly cool, and bones are undeniably essential for the way we live - if you're in any doubt, imagine being a big pink blob sliding across the ground.
They provide us with an effective internal support system; provide key protection for delicate organs, such as the brain, and act as "cellular factories", producing for example, over 2,000,000 red blood cells every few seconds.
Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Bone's strength comes down to its composite nature
They owe their incredible strength to the fact that they're based on composite of two very different materials; the inorganic, calcium-rich hydroxylapatite, and the flexible, organic collagen.
When testing this recently, I discovered, along with Prof Richie Gill, at the University of Bath, that the femur of the rather diminutive roe deer can sustain 1.7 tonnes of force before snapping: a phenomenal thought when you consider that this British species isn't much bigger than a Labrador after transferring these results to larger animals. We predicted that rhino femur could tolerate a staggering 109 tonnes.
It may be rather obvious by now that I'm rather besotted with all things osseous. It's not just that my academic research focuses on them, or because I just finished filming a whole series dedicated to the skeleton, or even because I have a sheep skeleton (Gloria) sat in a chair in my flat (after all, why keep skeletons just in the closet), it's more than that.
I've long been fascinated by bones and one thing which has intrigued me the most is how very often they look so similar to one another.
I grew up in coastal Norfolk and loved nothing more than endless beach walks. My brother once brought back a "big bird skull" and was amazed to find that it was actually a porpoise.
This is because skeletons have a shared ancestry and in many ways, often work from a very similar skeletal blueprint - their body plan.
Image copyright AP Image caption Despite their length, giraffe necks have the same number of vertebrae as human ones
Skeletons (as we understand them today) first started appearing on the scene about 420 million years ago. First seen in small fish, such as the recently-discovered Entelognathus, from China, the skeleton was a definite win, in terms of offering a whole host of evolutionary advantages. And as is often the case in life, once something works, everyone wants a piece of it.
As a result, skeletons blossomed and within a few million years, early tetrapods were hauling themselves out of the seas (skeletons enclosed, ready to take over the lands and the skies). This inexorable skeletal invasion ensured that there were certain elements that are ubiquitous across the vertebrates.
Skulls and vertebral columns are, by definition, inevitable. And structures such as the pentadactyl limb still follow an ancient body plan that ensures that no living vertebrate has more than five digits.
And for those who are thinking of a white and black bamboo-muncher, pandas don't count - it's not a "real" thumb. Let's say no more. Even horses with their single toes and birds with their three-digit wings share the basic five digit plans, all linked through shared evolutionary ancestry.
One of my favourite "fun bone facts" is that we have seven vertebrae in our neck and that we share this number with giraffes.
We both have seven cervical vertebrae, but the giraffe is evolved to tweak this basic mammalian body plan, to lengthen each vertebra, creating the wonderfully long-necked browsers that they are.
The skeleton of the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), up to 190 tonnes and 80ft in length, is not only the world's largest vertebrate, but also the largest animal to have ever lived.
The skeleton of Paedophryne amaensis, a tiny 7.7mm-long frog from Papua New Guinea (holding the title as the smallest vertebrate on the planet) might seem as different an animal as it's possible to get from the whale. But even a cursory look at the two skeletons is enough to see lots of similarities between these two creatures.
Image copyright AP Image caption The ball and socket joint in the wrist of a gibbon gives them unrivalled flexibility in the trees
To really understand the important roles that skeletons play in ecology, behaviour, and evolutionary studies, looking at the similarities is nothing compared with looking at the often subtle differences that separate them.
Looking at the hand again, a whole range of seemingly similar primate hands can (with a few minor tweaks) perform a whole range of tasks.
The aptly-named colobus (meaning "docked thumb") refers to a group of large-bodied monkeys, which are at home in the canopies. They have just the tiny remains of a thumb, which allows for a much better swinging grasp. But it is spider monkeys that have taken this to the extreme, and have lost their thumbs altogether.
Gibbons have a joint in the wrist unlike any other animal. They have a ball and socket-like joint (more akin to our hip joints), allowing for a massive range of rotation, permitting them to exhibit unrivalled canopy acrobatics.
Finally, there is one hand amongst our primate kin that really stands out and appears more Swiss Army knife than hand. It's the aye aye's. The largest of the nocturnal primates, the aye aye is adept at finding even the tastiest of grubs hidden deep inside the trunk of a tree.
Using highly specialised fingers, it performs "percussive foraging", tapping the wood and, after gnawing a hole in it, using another, specialised, elongated finger, to hook and ensnare its tasty prize.
These slight adaptations in the same body part enable closely related species to display drastically different behaviours, allowing them all to exploit very different ecological niches. This phenomenon can be seen in skeletons again and again.

I think we all saw this day coming. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito certainly did. Last term, Alito's holding in Vance v. Ball State essentially announced that it was open season on women you work with as long as you are not their direct superior. Thanks to “Alito time,” you can now sexually harass pretty much any woman at the office so long as they don't directly report to you, without getting your employer in trouble.
And sure, while it might be fun to sexually harass your boss's secretary, asking female colleagues to “touch it” is not without its dangers. In this crazy world, the female object of your desire might one day become your boss, or something similarly ridiculous. And who really wants to feel up a career-oriented co-worker anyway? Even if they can't sue the company, she's probably just going to be bitched about it in some uncool fashion anyway.
No, the gold standard for harassing people at work are the young, nubile, and generally helpless interns. They're the ones who can't really even complain about it. They're the ones who might take your creepy advances as a career opportunity. And now, according to a New York judge, you can do pretty much anything you want to them, so long as they are so desperate as to be working for your company for free….
BuzzFeed, via Today's Workplace (gavel bang: Brutha Man George Allan Jr.), has the ruling from Judge P. Kevin Castel:
A New York judge ruled Oct. 3 that a former female intern for Phoenix Satellite Television US, Inc. cannot bring a sexual harassment claim under the New York City Human Rights Law, according to Today's Workplace. The judge said their lack of paycheck prevents them from legally being considered an employee…. According to the district court, under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act or the New York State Human Rights Law, unpaid interns do not qualify as employees because of the “absence of remuneration” such as pension and life insurance, which is an “essential condition to the existence of an employer-employee relationship.”
Sweet. I love this plan, I'm excited to be a part of it. Ladies, if you want to learn about the exciting world of online journalism and legal commentary, please inquire within. You can get school credit, and if you are up for it, maybe we can go out for drinks later to talk about your career and how lovely you look in that dress.
In other “it's awesome to be a man” news, I just took a piss, standing up, after knocking back a couple of beers with my boss at a lunch where we predominately bitched about our wives. We'll probably go play golf this weekend, someplace nice where co-workers who are always on the rag won't bother us.
Okay, all joking aside, WHAT THE S**T IS THIS? How can it be that a woman can be harassed because she's working for free?
Really, this just all goes back to Alito's (and men like him) fundamental misapprehension of the nature of sexual harassment. They think that if your career is not on the line, then you can just reject unwanted harassment. It's kind of a nice way of saying that unpaid interns who are harassed are “asking for it” because they can just leave if they don't like it.
But the point is, and I think this is so basic that I can quote Rebecca freaking Romijn in one of the X-Men movies here, they shouldn't have to. Women shouldn't be forced out of unpaid internships because lecherous randoms can't keep it in their pants. We don't even have to get into the debate about whether or not an unpaid intern or female co-worker can put a stop to harassment — it's simple enough to recognize that they shouldn't have to put up with it at all.
It's not hard! I work with hot, under-25 fashion interns every day. I don't sexually harass them… using my Jedi-like skills of not trying to have sex with people I work with, and jerking off after everybody goes home. The last thing these hard-working women need is somebody like me sleazing all over them while they try to document the best celebrity nip-slips.
Aren't things crappy enough for unpaid interns that they shouldn't have to also deal with unwanted sexual advances without legal recourse? Isn't that the most minimal protection we can offer the sexy women with boyfriends who live someplace else who brighten up our summers and holiday parties for free?

Murrell and their wife Jo Ann weathered the storm following Hurricane Floyd in 1999 and chose to do this same during Hurricane Matthew. (Zach Frailey/Daily Free Press via AP)
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Searchers found two more bodies inside vehicles that were submerged in flood waters in North Carolina from Hurricane Matthew, increasing the toll in the state to 26 dead, Gov. Pat McCrory said Saturday.
McCrory talked a lot about recovery at their Saturday news conference — one week after the hurricane dumped more than a foot of rain 100 miles inland causing massive flooding in the eastern part of the state. Towns such as Princeville, Lumberton and Fair Bluff remain underwater, and not all rivers have crested.
Early next week, the governor plans to release a detailed plan on how North Carolina will rebuild, including how to pay for the effort. But they said serious problems remain.
“There are still many, may difficult days ahead for North Carolina,” McCrory said.
The latest victims from the flooding were found in Cumberland County and Wayne County after flood waters receded from last weekend's rains. Almost all the deaths in North Carolina have been from people driving or walking into flood waters and being swept away.
Flooding triggered by the hurricane has killed at least 43 people in the United States and more than 500 people in Haiti
McCrory said Friday was the first day since the rains began that crews have not had to rescue anyone from the water.
Interstate 95 remains closed in both directions around Lumberton, despite crews working around the clock to fix bridges, pavement and clear debris. Crews can't give an estimate on when the East Coast's main north-south highway will reopen at that spot.
“We have to see the inspections, we have to finish the engineering, we have to finish the construction,” McCrory said.
Only about 13,000 customers remain without power in North Carolina, most of them in Robeson County where the inundation from the Tar River preventing crews from working.
In South Carolina, crews are still working on 18,000 power outages a week after the storm. Federal officials declared two more counties disaster areas and authorities are watching the Waccamaw and Little Pee Dee rivers as the near record levels after flowing into the state from North Carolina.
Meanwhile, drought continues to creep into areas of North Carolina west of Charlotte, which saw almost no rain from Hurricane Matthew. Hendersonville, a city of about 15,000 in the state's western mountains, plans to ask residents to begin conserving water next week. The far western part of the state is in a severe drought.

We continue to be great admirers of Wikipedia, but we've always missed out on one crucial aspect of their system: we never allowed anonymous users to edit content. No, that required earning privileges through participation — specifically, the retag privilege at 500 reputation and the full editing privilege at 2000 reputation.
Well, as of today, I'm proud to announce that we allow anonymous and new users to edit content in our system! The surface area of this change is huge — it means the millions of drive-by anonymous users that visit our sites every day can submit an improvement or correction. Furthermore, you can earn up to +1000 reputation for submitting valid edits.
We do currently limit anonymous edits to questions and answers more than 10 minutes old (and with some different caveats, wiki pages too). Millions of posts now have that ubiquitous edit link at the bottom. Click it, and you'll be sent to the standard editing interface, albeit with a small disclaimer at the top.
There are a few additional requirements when submitting an edit suggestion:
You must enter a reasonable comment describing your edit.
To prevent noise and friction, your change must be more than 6 characters.
After the edit is submitted, it goes into an edit suggestion queue of a fixed size. (If the queue is currently full, we temporarily stop accepting edits.) Users who have earned the editing privilege can now vote to accept — or reject — the suggested edit. There are two ways to view suggested edits:
Suggested edits for a post are always visible on the post itself. If edits are pending on a particular post, the post's edit menu will have a counter next to it.
Clicking on the edit from a post will show it inline in a floating panel, so you aren't interrupted.
If you have 10,000 reputation, a counter will appear at the top of the page showing the size of the edit suggestion queue (if it's greater than zero, of course). Clicking this counter will take you to a new /review tab that lists all suggested edits in the queue.
Once you click on a suggested edit, you get a diff view that shows you the original post on the left, and the edited version on the right. All additions and deletions are highlighted. You can also toggle between HTML and Markdown views via the toolbar buttons on the left.
From here, you can approve or reject the edit. When an edit is approved, the editor receives +2 reputation — up to a maximum of +1000 total per user. Contributing good edits is now a nice way to gain reputation and bootstrap less active users into full members of the community.
To keep this post a sane and readable size, I have glossed over a lot of the other rules that we have in place to handle edge conditions with edit suggestions. If you have further questions or want lots more detail, please read Sam's meta post before leaving a comment here.

Experienced users with 2,000 reputation or more can review these edits and approve or reject them.
When registered users' edits are accepted, they earn +2 rep, up to a maximum of +1000.
I've always wanted to extend some form of editing privileges on our site to everyone on the internet. I just apologize that it took us over two years to figure out how to do it!
A new Web ad from conservative group Crossroads GPS targets a presidential talking point on America's oil production.
It argues that President Barack Obama takes credit for drilling that resulted from President George W. Bush's policies, while glossing over a recent decline in production on public land.
"Tell Obama, stop blaming others, and work to pass better energy policies!" a narrator says.
The ad starts with Obama's claim that domestic oil production is at an eight-year high, something we've twice rated Mostly True.
Then a narrator asks: "Oh, really? Their own administration admits production's down where Obama's in charge."
On screen, the ad displays a statistic from the Interior Department published by an energy news service that, "Oil production fell by 14 percent … on federal lands and waters."
That's a one-year statistic we've also rated Mostly True.
This ad focuses on Obama's role in domestic oil production on government land. We're evaluating the claim that the president's oil "production's down where Obama's in charge."
The data
Greenwire, the energy news service cited by Crossroads, published Interior Department numbers for oil production on federal lands and waters in a Feb. 27, 2012, story, citing them in a second story, which was the piece Crossroads used.
The story said, "Oil production fell by 14 percent in fiscal 2011 below the previous year on federal lands and waters, according to statistics provided last month by the Interior Department."
So, oil production on federal lands, onshore and offshore, fell from 2010-11, according to Obama administration agencies. So far, so good, for Crossroads' analysis — other than the fact that it failed to cite a time period for the statistic it quoted from Greenwire.
Does that matter?
Yes, says Jay Hakes, who directed the independent U.S. Energy Information Administration for seven years during the Clinton administration. "From a statistical standpoint, to take one year out of three — one year is not indicative of a trend," they said.
We pulled the numbers since 2003 from a U.S. Energy Information Administration report, also based on data from the Interior Department and its Office of Natural Resources Revenue.
Bush was in office from January 2001 to January 2009. In our chart, we've italicized the years they were in office and put in bold the years Obama led.
The Obama administration points out that the average production for Obama's first three years is a 13 percent increase over the average production over Bush's last three years.
We note that:
• From 2004-08, well into Bush's tenure, oil production on federal lands and waters fell in four of five years, for a net decrease of 16.8 percent.
• From 2009-11, the Obama years, oil production rose two of three years, for a net increase of 10.6 percent.
Crude oil sales from federal lands
Fiscal year Offshore (million barrels) Onshore Total Percent change from prior year 2003 579 101 680 n/a 2004 572 97 669 -1.6% 2005 542 96 638 -4.6% 2006 471 101 572 -10.3% 2007 514 105 619 +8.2 2008 462 104 566 -8.6% 2009 527 105 632 +11.7% 2010 618 108 726 +14.9% 2011 514 112 626 - 13.8% Source: EIA; some numbers slightly off due to independent rounding in source data
What's likely to happen this year and next?
EIA doesn't have projections for total production on federal lands, says spokesperson Jonathan Cogan, but does project that offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico will continue to lag through 2013, with a drop of less than 4 percent from 2011. (Here's the data in millions of barrels per day, though it's calendar year data vs. the fiscal year data we show above.)
Who's to credit or blame?
So, does Bush get credit for domestic oil expansion on private land and Obama the blame for a drop in public production, as the Crossroad ad describes? The picture is quite a bit more complex than a 30-second ad allows.
"I don't think Obama can claim a lot of credit for production levels now, and I'm not even sure that Bush can," said Hakes, the author of A Declaration of Energy Independence, which looks at energy policy from President Harry S. Truman to President George W. Bush. "If you're going to go back — who should get the credit — I might be able to find something that Nixon did."
The expansion of fracking, for example — using pressurized fluid to get gas or oil out of rock formations — came about over decades.
"That's why attaching production things to any particular administration is a very, very tricky business, and probably best handled in books rather than in articles," Hakes said. "There are just too many factors."
So, Obama certainly shouldn't be claiming full credit for increases in oil production on private land — but neither should supporters of Bush.
Meanwhile, the story of the one-year dropoff in public production has a significant asterisk: the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. A six-month moratorium on exploratory drilling followed — though it by no means stopped gulf oil production — along with changes in regulation that forced the industry to adjust.
(Bush had their own disasters to contend with: Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 also drove a decline the next year, said Shirley Neff, a senior adviser at EIA.)
Oil production on federal land — not water — actually rose 3.7 percent in 2011. It was offshore production that took the hit, falling 16.8 percent. That's something that Greenwire, the news service Crossroads cited in its ad, pointed out in its February story.
"This is a pretty significant decline; it almost has to represent the impact of the moratorium," Dan Kish, senior vice president for policy at the Institute for Energy Research, told Greenwire for the article.
While the moratorium could have been more targeted, it wasn't a policy choice unique to Obama, said Hakes, the former EIA director who also directed policy and research for the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling.
Republican President Richard Nixon, for example, ordered one in the wake of a 1969 well blowout in Santa Barbara, Calif. "Every president, if you have a blowout like that … is going to get a moratorium," Hakes said.
Meanwhile, before the spill, Obama had announced a "fairly expansive stance" toward offshore drilling, including off the Florida Panhandle and the coast of Virginia, Hakes said. While that movement stalled with the BP disaster, the president has still moved toward arctic drilling off the coast of Alaska, alarming some environmental advocates.
(We wrote about permit approvals under Obama in a fact-check of Rick Santorum, who had falsely claimed the president "put (up) a stop sign … against oil drilling.")
Our ruling
A Crossroads GPS ad says Obama takes credit for Bush-era policies, then blames them for a downturn in oil production on federal lands. While it's true that the effect of a president's policies don't show up in oil production for some time — in some cases, decades — the ad goes too far when it cites a 14 percent decline in production in a single year as evidence of the impact of Obama's overall energy strategy. The ad says oil production's down where Obama's in charge." The facts show that the decline represents a single year that followed years of substantial gains and occurred only offshore in the wake of a major oil disaster. The ad's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.
CORRECTION: We updated this item on April 18, 2012, to add the change from 2008 to 2009 to our net increase/decrease calculation for oil production on federal lands under Obama. That changed a small net decrease to a net increase of 10.6 percent. Our ruling has not changed.
Students, parents and teachers from the Phoenix Union High School District and the Madison Elementary District hold a rally for bond and override elections on Oct. 10, 2015. (Photo: Michael Schennum/The Republic)
On Nov. 3, voters in the Phoenix Union High School District will decide whether the district will receive additional funding for its capital budget.
The district's capital budget has been cut by 85 percent by the Arizona Legislature since 2008, or more than $12 million, said state Rep. Lela Alston, D-Phoenix, in an interview. The override would be funded by a secondary property tax that would cost an extra $35.89 for a home valued at $100,000.
The override would raise the budget by $15.3 million annually.
The Phoenix Union governing board said the money would go toward library books, instruments, uniforms, classroom furniture, athletic equipment, fine-art supplies and campus maintenance, according to a district press release.
The main purpose of the new money, however, is technological improvement, Alston said.
"We need to get up to speed with the technology in all of our schools," said Alston, who also is president of the district's governing board. "What this override will do is bring us back up to par had the state not made those cuts."
Alston said that without passing the override the district will be able to "trickle along" but will be unable to update or improve any of its existing equipment.
Interim district Superintendent Chad Gestson said it is important to produce students with 21st-century skills.
"We live in a very digital society, we have to be very technologically rich. We also have to make sure we are producing technologically savvy students, and this is going to bring back a lot of the technology that should be in place," Gestson said.
Get informed Polls are open Nov. 3 from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Find your polling center here
Phoenix Union is looking at multiple ways to improve technology, from updating computers in computer labs, buying new laptop carts and supplying one-to-one devices for students like e-readers and Google Chromebooks, Gestson said.
"We are also looking into these 'MakerLabs' popping up across the country, schools now with 3-D printers, advanced computers, kids learning programming and robotics," they said, adding that all of that could be funded with an enhanced capital budget.
Phoenix Councilwoman Kate Gallego, who supports the override, said making sure school technology is up to date is crucial for keeping Phoenix a competitive market for employers.
"Before I was elected to the Phoenix City Council, I worked in economic development, and the education system is so important in attracting and keeping good jobs," Gallego said. "If we don't give our students the best technology, they won't be prepared for cutting-edge jobs. I often meet with employers, and they say what our market really needs is more computer skills, those are the jobs that are the hardest to fill."
But Jonathan Butcher, education director at the Goldwater Institute, a Phoenix-based conservative public-policy think tank, believes the district has sufficient money to operate.
"They have a steady operating reserve, their per-student funding is close to the national average. They appear to have their finances handled, and they don't appear desperate from what I see," Butcher said. "Unless you have really excellent teachers, and a system that allows parents to make decisions about where and how their children are educated, it's not going to matter how many computers you have."
Butcher also said Phoenix Union spends $9,634 per student, $2,000 more than their peers in Arizona, citing the state auditor's 2014 spending report for Phoenix Union. The national average for funds spent per student in 2012 was $10,667, and the average Arizona school spent $7,578 per student in 2014, according to the spending report by the Arizona Auditor General's Office.
Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton supports the override and said Phoenix Union is one of the most important school districts in the state, serving more than 27,000 students.
"Demographically it represents the future of our city and the future of our state, so making sure it has the resources it needs to succeed is critically important to the future of the city of Phoenix," Stanton said. "The override isn't going to give them extra stuff, it's going to help get them basic needs. More technology in the classroom, classroom repairs, basic things we'd expect a great urban school district would need to succeed."

Historians have disagreed considerably on deciding when exactly the Duke of Northumberland's plot to plant their son Guildford on the English throne – by marrying them to Lady Jane Grey – came into being. Traditionally this happened quite early, sometime in 1552, so as to give the duke enough time for their nefarious enterprise. It has been observed that they did not have enough time,1 however, so that in recent decades (i.e. from 1970 onwards) the date has wandered to early 1553, or to the spring, or even to the early summer of that fateful year. In parallel it has also been debated whether there was even a plot at all, or whether the attempted change in the succession was rather instituted according to the wishes of the adolescent king. Most historians now believe that Edward VI and their chief minister plotted together.
Many differing scenarios of the events can be found in history books, and some are more plausible than others, while it is probably impossible to arrive at the exact truth. There can only be interpretations of what may have happened, and there is plenty of evidence to consider.
Tradition has it that Edward was a sickly child and suffered from a weak constitution, but their health seems to have been normally robust. However, at Christmas 1552 they caught a cold, and in early February 1553 they were suffering from a high fever which alarmed the authorities enough to summon the Lady Mary, their half-sister, to London. On arrival they were obsequiously honoured in recognition of the fact that they were the heir apparent.2 Edward never fully recovered their health, but it was not at all clear from the outset of their illness that they would die within a few months. There were intermittent signs of hope until in late May their condition worsened dramatically.
Henry VIII had buttressed their changes to the succession of the crown by Acts of Parliament, and apparently this set a precedent that any further changes would also need to be sanctioned by parliament to be lawful. Aware of this, Edward VI on 19 June 1553 personally stipulated that their will should be ratified by that body. The next day the writs were sent out for the assembly to meet on 18 September.
Tantalizingly, Edward VI had opened a parliament on 1 March 1553, only to close it on 31 March. Oddly enough, the government had dissolved the parliament instead of simply proroguing it, which would have dispensed with the need of new elections for the next session of parliament; this indicates that on 31 March Northumberland had no idea that they would be in need of one in the foreseeable future. As it came, the parliament called in June for September really came together in October 1553, to inaugurate the reign of Queen Mary.
Is it conceivable that Northumberland would have disbanded the one institution that could have sanctioned their alleged plans for the crown, the business unfinished? It has been argued that they would not have dared to broach the subject of the succession in parliament;3 however this seems unconvincing in the light of their bold later doings, and they had already decided to call parliament in the first place in spite of misgivings over asking them for a subsidy. While, as was usual, the subsidy was the chief purpose there were also other tough questions handled with great efficiency,4 and any mid-Tudor parliament could not seriously have denied its sovereign anything if demanded by them in person (as Edward, though in bad health, could certainly have done).
It is likely therefore that in March 1553 the government – or Northumberland and their cronies – were not yet aware of Edward's plans for the succession or even their hopeless case.5 It is sometimes said that the Venetian ambassador had an audience with the king in March, in which they found them to be clearly dying.6 However, in the relazione or diplomatic report out of which this detail seems to have been evoked there is no mention of any audience or of a moribund Edward;7 and anyway the ambassador writing on 17 March that Edward was – possibly – mortally ill was the Imperial rather than the Venetian. In the case of the Habsburg ambassador, however, wishful thinking played as big a part as actual information.8

PoliZette Email Dump Exposes Hillary's Secret Love of Fracking Clinton says they advocated drilling all over the world, but let political allies kill energy jobs at home
Fracking was invented by the U.S. government and Hillary Clinton loved the energy production process so much, they advocated it worldwide, according to leaked transcripts of speeches made to business people.
The disclosure comes after Wikileaks released emails hacked from John Podesta, chairperson of the Clinton campaign, on Friday.
Despite a fracking ban in their home state of New York, Hillary Clinton told bankers, “I've promoted fracking in other places around the world.”

Podesta received comments made in past Hillary Clinton speeches flagged as potential liabilities. Parts of those speeches included speeches to big investment banks such as Goldman Sachs. And many of the excerpts betrayed significant conflicts between what Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton says on the campaign trail and what they really believes.
Clinton's support for fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, could cause further consternation among those in their base who enthusiastically supported Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during their contentious primary.
Standing before Deutsche Bank on April 24, 2013, Clinton not only said they supported fracking — an energy production process hated by left-wing environmentalists — but that the government invented it.
[lz_third_party align=center includes=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfymhAEe-TM]
“I mean, fracking was developed at the Department of Energy. I mean, the whole idea of how fracking came to be available in the marketplace is because of research done by our government,” Clinton said in a paid speech before the bankers. “And I've promoted fracking in other places around the world.”

The U.S. government is generally not credited with developing hydraulic fracturing to get at trapped natural gas and oil. In lesser forms, the process started in the 1860s, according to John Manfreda, writing for OilPrice.com.
Research continued through the decades. The Department of Energy did help the process along in the 1970s, according to the New York Times.
But the modern practice — made economically feasible, to boot — was refined by George P. Mitchell. According to the Times, Mitchell's company injected the ground with water, sand and a chemical mixture, rather than more expensive foams and gels, into the wells. The process became viable for gas and made Mitchell rich.
It also began America's new energy boom when companies drilled horizontally, and then used the technique.
But, of course, the environmentalists hate any such invasion of Mother Earth. The state of New York banned the process in 2014, despite huge energy potential in upstate New York. The fracking boom was projected to create thousands of jobs in the beleaguered upstate region, but opposition from liberals, celebrities and activists in Albany and New York City doomed the industry there. Clinton has remained mum on the state's ban.
[lz_jwplayer video=PT10nAP5]

Meanwhile, Ohio and Pennsylvania are fracking away, and creating jobs and energy.
The admission that Clinton tried to spread fracking worldwide — but not in their home state of New York — is possibly more controversial than any other admission about the subject.
Sanders supporter Susan Sarandon, the actor, said a key reason they didn't support Clinton was that they traveled the world and advocated the energy production process, which cracks open parts of the earth to release natural gas and oil. The process is also hated by New Yorker Yoko Ono and son Sean Lennon, who wrote, “Don't Frack My Mother.”
As for the opposition to the process, Clinton — in a familiar refrain — told another business group that it was the Russians who were whipping up opposition.
“We were up against Russia pushing oligarchs and others to buy media,” Clinton told tinePublic on June 18, 2014. “We were even up against phony environmental groups, and I'm a big environmentalist, but these were funded by the Russians to stand against any effort — oh that pipeline, that fracking, that whatever will be a problem for you — and a lot of the money supporting that message was coming from Russia.”

[lz_related_box id=”217786″]
TinePublic is a promotional group that pays for speeches. What audience paid TinePublic to get Clinton to speak is unclear. But Clinton aimed their remarks at energy companies, seemingly to assure them they were no radical.
And while Clinton mostly deferred questions on the big Keystone XL oil pipeline that Obama later stopped from crossing the U.S.-Canadian border, Clinton called for more pipelines in Europe. Clinton said the pipelines and more international fracking would help reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas.
“I would like to see us accelerating the development of pipelines from Azerbaijan up into Europe,” Clinton told business leaders in Montreal, Canada. “I would like to see us looking for ways to accelerate the internal domestic production. Poland recently signed a big contract to explore hydraulic fracturing to see what it could produce. Apparently, there is thought to be some good reserves there. And just really go at this in a self interested, smart way. The Russians can only intimidate you if you are dependent upon them.”
The average (median) weekly pay for full-time employees rose by 1.8% in the latest year, according to the latest figures from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE).
The data showed a rise from £518 in April 2014 to £528 in April 2015. But how has pay changed over a longer period?
Back in 1997 the average hourly wage for full-time employees was £7.92 compared to £13.36 in 2015, but looking at averages alone can mask bigger changes in the distribution of earnings. Pay is affected by many factors, not least the health of the economy. Several pay initiatives have also been introduced over the last 18 years, including those written into law such as the National Minimum Wage (NMW). This analysis shows that such initiatives appear to have had a profound effect on the distribution of earnings.

In 1997, the distribution shows that many jobs were paying between £4 and £5 per hour, with the number of jobs being paid more than this gradually decreasing as hourly pay increased. In 2015, by contrast, there is a large spike of jobs being paid around the £6.50 mark – in line with the NWM rate for those aged over 21 in 2014. Above this level of pay the distribution follows a similar pattern to that of 1997, albeit shifted to right, with larger numbers of jobs at higher hourly wages partly as a result of inflation and higher productivity.
So it appears that there is a bigger concentration of jobs at the bottom end of the pay scale in 2015 than in 1997, many of them being paid close to the minimum wage.

Proportion of adult jobs worked paid within 2% of the National Minimum Wage, 1999 to 2015, UK

The National Minimum Wage was introduced in April 1999 and at the time the adult rate (those aged 22 and above) was set at £3.60 an hour. This has gradually increased over time to £6.70 in October 2015 for those aged 21 and over. During this time a greater proportion of jobs have been paid at or close to this rate. In 1999, around 2% of jobs were paid within 2% of the NMW, and this has steadily increased to over 5% of jobs in 2015.
So more jobs are being paid close to the minimum wage. One possible reason for this is that earnings growth for employees hasn't always matched increases to the minimum wage - which have been greater than inflation in most years since its introduction. In 2002, around 70% of full-time employees saw real earnings growth (a measure that is adjusted for inflation). However, following the economic downturn this fell to around 35% in 2011.
In fact, many full-time employees saw a reduction in their real weekly earnings during this time. By 2015, this trend had reversed again: around 70% of full-time employees experienced real weekly earnings growth in the year to April 2015.

When countries earned their independence, and celebrate it

AMERICANS celebrate their independence from Britain on July 4th with fireworks, hot dogs and a sea of Star-Spangled Banners. Freedom in 1776 came around 170 years after the first English settlers landed. The United States was the first of more than 50 countries that eventually became independent from Britain. Far-flung colonies peopled with pioneers or prisoners were hard to administer and tended to break away earlier than closer territories. Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1810 and other Spanish colonies swiftly followed. Brazil earned its freedom from Portugal in 1822. Canada became independent in 1867 (on better terms than neighbouring America), though it wasn't until 1982 that the country divested itself fully of Britain's role in constitutional matters. Like America, Canada also celebrates its independence in July. It is the most popular month for countries to fete their freedom. The biggest wave of independence started in the late 1950s, when most of Africa was freed of British, French, Portuguese and Belgian rule. The next bloc to earn its freedom was in the early 1990s when the Soviet Union fell and satellite states had their sovereignty restored.
Just one day after being sued in federal court, the Department of Homeland Security has withdrawn its order to unmask the @Alt_USCIS account, a harshly critical account nominally run by an anonymous Homeland Security staffer. In March, two agents of Customs and Border Protection had served Twitter with an order for IP logs, phone numbers, and other identifying information associated with the account. Twitter declined to comply with the request, and argued in its complaint that the order was unconstitutional, and relied on an unconventional statute insufficient for unmasking an individual user.
Now, that order is being withdrawn. Twitter learned of the withdrawal in a meeting with the Department of Justice earlier today, and has subsequently withdrawn its lawsuit. Reached by The Verge, the company declined to comment.
It's unclear whether the government will make further attempts to unmask the user. Because the March order was made by Customs agents, it relied on an unusual statute largely related to taxes on the importation of merchandise, which Twitter argued was insufficient. If the Department of Justice is committed to unmasking the user, it might request a court order for the same information under a statute that's more in-line with Twitter's law enforcement guidelines, which acknowledge that private information may be disclosed in response to a valid legal request.
@Alt_USCIS is one of a number of “rogue” accounts that have sprung up under President Trump, offering a critical perspective on the policies of the new administration. It is unclear which if any of the accounts are genuine, but they have drawn both attention and scrutiny as the administration has sought to crack down on unauthorized leaks to the press.
The doctrine of lapse was an annexation policy applied by the British East India Company in India until 1858. According to the doctrine, any Indian princely state under the suzerainty of the British East India Company (the dominant imperial power in the subcontinent), as a vassal state under the British subsidiary system, would have its princely status abolished (and therefore annexed into British India) if the ruler was either "manifestly incompetent or died without a male heir".[1] The latter supplanted the long-established right of an Indian sovereign without an heir to choose a successor.[citation needed] In addition, the British decided whether potential rulers were competent enough. The doctrine and its application were widely regarded by many Indians as illegitimate.
The policy is most commonly associated with Lord Dalhousie, who was the Governor General of the East India Company in India between 1848 and 1856. However, it was articulated by the Court of Directors of the East India Company as early as 1834 and several smaller states were already annexed under this doctrine before Dalhousie took over the post of Governor-General. Dalhousie used the policy most vigorously and extensively, though, so it is generally associated with him. The accession of Lord Dalhousie inaugurated a new chapter in the history of British India. They functioned as the Governor-General of India from 1848-1856. It can be suggested that the doctrine was hypocritical. This is because, during the enforcement of this doctrine, England was ruled by a Queen not a male heir to the throne. However the counter-argument is that the doctrine is based on the East India Company being the sovereign ruler of the territories - the suzerain - and that the UK was itself sovereign, having no other state who held its suzerainty.
History [ edit ]
At the time of its adoption, the British East India Company had imperial administrative jurisdiction over wide regions of the subcontinent. The company took over the princely states of Satara (1848), Jaitpur and Sambalpur (1849), Nagpur and Jhansi (1854), Tore and Arcot (1855) and Udaipur (Chhattisgarh) under the terms of the doctrine of lapse. Oudh (1856) is widely believed to have under the Doctrine of Lapse. However it was annexed by Lord Dalhousie under the pretext of mis-governance. Mostly clang that the ruler was not ruling properly, the Company added about four million pounds sterling to its annual revenue by virtue of this doctrine.[2] Udaipur State, however, would have local rule reinstated by the British in 1860.[3]
With the increasing power of the East India Company, discontent simmered among many sections of Indian society and the largely indigenous armed forces; these rallied behind the deposed dynasties during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, also known as the Sepoy Mutiny. Following the rebellion, in 1858, the new British Viceroy of India, whose rule replaced that of the British East India Company, renounced the doctrine.[4]
The princely state of Kittur was taken over by the East India Company in 1824 by imposing a 'doctrine of lapse'. So it is debatable whether it was devised by Lord Dalhousie in 1848, though they arguably made it official by documenting it. Dalhousie's annexations and the doctrine of lapse had caused suspicion and uneasiness among most ruling princes in India.
Doctrine of lapse before Dalhousie [ edit ]
Dalhousie applied the doctrine of lapse vigorously for annexing Indian princely states, but the policy was not solely their invention. The Court of Directors of the East India Company had articulated this early in 1834.[5] As per this policy, the Company annexed Mandvi in 1839, Kolaba and Jalaun in 1840 and Surat in 1842.

In response to the 2007-08 Financial Crisis that cost the United States more than $20 trillion, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on July 21, 2010 with the aim of overhauling the dysfunctional regulatory regime. In the years since, the wide-reaching reforms mandated by Dodd-Frank have provided key protections to consumers and stability to the banking system. Thanks to such reforms, banks and the US capital markets have emerged from the Financial Crisis more resilient than before and regulators are now better equipped to respond to future crises and regulatory challenges.
Yet, according to conservative narrative, there is simply no need for financial reform. The Trump Administration and conservatives in Congress have actively pursued ways to unravel Dodd-Frank based on an account of the Financial Crisis that differs drastically from the conventional wisdom. The conservative worldview is shaped by a series of arguments generated by conservative think tanks, media, political action groups, and industry lobbyists. This paper provides a broad outline of their arguments and how they differ from what has actually happened.
COOLUM, Australia -- Golfers at the Australian PGA Championship might feel as if they are going back in time.
Way back in time.
The new owner of the Palmer Coolum Resort has erected between the No. 9 green and 10th tee a 26-foot mechanical T. rex, which flips its tail and opens its mouth to unleash a menacing roar when anyone approaches. The owner, billionaire Australian mining magnate Clive Palmer, at least has agreed to turn it off during the tournament.

But it's one reason the Australian PGA will be leaving Coolum after 11 years.
"I've heard it sounds like we are going to 'Jurassic Park,' so this will be interesting," Robert Allenby said.
Palmer wants to import more molded dinosaurs and turn the ocean resort into a theme park, or maybe a casino, but their plans have clashed with a tournament that dates to 1905. The owner already has put up more than 60 signs around the golf course to promote their interests, which includes their plan to build a replica of the Titanic.
Some of those signs, however, are in the landing areas on the fairways. That forced organizers to mark those areas "ground under repair," where golfers will be able to move the ball if the shot is affected by the signs.
On Sunday, the issue came to a head with Australasian PGA Tour officials, and the tournament appeared in jeopardy. The show will go on, at least this year. PGA chief executive Brian Thorburn said Tuesday that this will be the last year at Coolum. It will be played in Queensland next year, and the tour is looking at other options beyond that in Brisbane and the Gold Coast.
Thorburn said they wouldn't get into the "cut and thrust" of the negotiations Sunday, or how close the tournament was to being canceled.
"We have had a great run on the Sunshine Coast, it has been fantastic, but nothing stays forever," Thorburn said. "Emotionally, it will be sad."
Palmer tweeted on Sunday: "We had some issues with pgaofaustralia but all now resolved amicably and we are looking forward to the tournament at Palmer Coolum Resort."
The tournament moved to Coolum in 2002 after two years at Royal Queensland in Brisbane. But it's also been played at Royal Melbourne, where Hale Irwin (1978) and Seve Ballesteros (1981) were among the winners, and other top Australian courses. This year's field includes Adam Scott, Greg Norman, Darren Clarke, Geoff Ogilvy and Australian Open champion Peter Senior.
The T. rex is nicknamed "Jeff" and is activated by movement. Golfers playing social rounds recently have taken "dinosaur mulligans" when the roar occurs during a backswing on the 10th tee.
Palmer has agreed to turn off the robotic features of the dinosaur during the tournament, although it might be featured during Wednesday's pro-am.
When asked if they ever imagined the century-old Australian PGA would be played on a course with a 26-foot T. rex, Thourburn smiled and said "no."
"But having said that, let's put it into perspective," they added. "It has generated some tremendous publicity for this tournament and we don't have a big marketing budget so in that regard everybody knows that the PGA is on at Coolum at the moment."
Defending champion Greg Chalmers was taken aback by the prehistoric beast.
"I'm glad it's not roaring, that's a good start," Chalmers said. "It is just a little strange. It is not what I expected to see."
Dual citizenship crisis: October High Court dates set, Tony Windsor to challenge Barnaby Joyce
Updated
The fate of politicians referred to the High Court over the citizenship saga will not be known until at least mid-October.
Key points: Politicians' citizenship cases to be heard in High Court on October 10-12
Court to decide fate of Barnaby Joyce, Matt Canavan, Malcolm Roberts, Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam
Tony Windsor to join citizenship challenge and argue Joyce breached the constitution
The court held its first hearings on the cases in Brisbane on Thursday, and Chief Justice Susan Kiefel has ordered the matter be heard in Canberra on October 10-12.
It is not clear yet how long it could take the court to decide on the case and announce its decision on the five cases currently before it — those of Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, former Nationals Minister Matt Canavan, One Nation's Malcolm Roberts and former Greens senators Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam.
Solicitor-general Stephen Donaghue QC, acting for the Commonwealth, had urged the hearings be scheduled in mid-September to ease any concerns about the validity of decisions made by the 45th Parliament.
In another twist, Mr Joyce's political nemesis, Tony Windsor, has been given permission to join the citizenship challenge in the High Court.
Mr Windsor will argue Mr Joyce has breached the constitution, as they were a dual citizen of New Zealand.
Mr Windsor's lawyers, appearing by videolink from Melbourne, also argued for the right to cross-examine Mr Joyce if they needed it for their case.
Solicitor-general Stephen Donaghue QC, acting for the Commonwealth, urged the court to hear the matters by mid-September.
Chief Justice Kiefel said they understood the "unusual circumstances" of the challenges, and the "high level of urgency", given it would have an impact on the current make-up of the Parliament.
However, they raised concerns whether the matters could be dealt with that quickly, particularly when Deputy Nationals leader Fiona Nash and South Australian senator Nick Xenophon's cases were awaiting formal referral to the court.
Chief Justice Kiefel asked the solicitor-general whether there was a "real practical difficulty in terms of governance" if the court waited until October to hear the cases, to which Mr Donaghue replied there was not.
Lawyers for Senator Canavan also said the Commonwealth had "underestimated the complexity of their case", given the nature of their Italian citizenship.
They also suggested the highly publicised story they had presented about their mother signing them up for Italian citizenship was "irrelevant", rather arguing that there had been retrospective changes to Italian laws that had led to the strife.
Mr Donaghue said the cases of Senator Canavan, Mr Joyce and Ms Waters were different to those of Senator Roberts and Mr Ludlam.
They argued Senator Canavan, Mr Joyce and Ms Waters had no knowledge they could be considered dual citizens under foreign law.
The solicitor-general but suggested Senator Roberts and Mr Ludlam knew or should have known.
Lawyers for Senator Roberts criticised the initial timing of the full hearings, suggested by the Commonwealth.
They also took issue with the Attorney-General's offer to get the same British QC enlisted to give expert evidence on other citizenship cases to also draft a report about Senator Roberts' status.
The argument was that they should have the chance to brief the legal expert themselves, and have the opportunity to find their own experts if they did not agree.

A young boy is being hailed a Syrian superhero after they were caught on film appearing to dodge a swarm of bullets in order to save a little girl pinned down by a sniper.
Harrowing video footage posted to YouTube on Monday by the activist Shaam News Network channel shows the boy, no older than 10, making a mad dash for the girl, who is cowering behind an old, burned-out truck in the middle of a street.
The rescue appears to take a turn for the worse as the youngster drops to the ground when it looks like he's been blasted by incoming bullets. But apparently the boy was just playing possum and waiting for the perfect opportunity to make a run for it.
They rush to the girl, grabs them by the hand and takes off back the way they came — ducking and dodging another shower of bullets. Amazingly, the two manage to make it out of the danger zone safely.
Though the footage has yet to be verified and its setting is unknown, many YouTube users praised the boy.
YouTube user Saud Helal wrote: “A smart boy, strategies [acquired] by living the wars.”
“Obviously they feign deaths so the shooters will stop shooting,” another user writes.
The Shaam News Network is a television channel run by pro-rebel Syrian activists stationed in Damascus, according to their website.
The video has been viewed more than 130,000 times.
In the middle of a mental health episode last Thursday night, 26-year old University of Houston student Alan Pean had the foresight to drive themselves to a nearby hospital to get treatment. But instead of getting the mental health treatment they sought, they ended up in the intensive care unit getting treated for a gunshot wound to the chest.
After stepping into the St. Joseph Medical Center, a second episode struck. Two off-duty Houston Police Department officers, who were working separate jobs as hospital security guards, responded. The three of them reportedly had a violent struggle.

During the bout, one of the officers fired a single shot, hitting Pean in the chest. Pean is facing two counts of aggravated assault on a public servant for the incident, the Houston Police Department told Fusion.
These preliminary facts of the case have been met with anger from friends and family of Pean, as well as mental health professionals around the country.
Never, never, never is it appropriate for a patient seeking care, to have their life threatened in our arms. — Joint Statement from concerned doctors and medical students

A joint statement about the case from doctors and medical students has amassed over 1,700 signatures. "As doctors and medical students, as nurses and care partners, we are trained in how to safely restrain and tranquilize patients, no matter how aggressive, or irritable, or anxious, or threatening they may be," it reads. "Never, never, never is it appropriate for a patient seeking care, to have their life threatened in our arms."
Pean has regained consciousness and is stabilizing.
"For this to have happened to our brother, it's just incomprehensible and it's just terrible," brother Christian Pean told a local CBS affiliate. The family has hired high-profile attorney Mark O'Mara, who got George Zimmerman acquitted from the shooting of Trayvon Martin, to represent them.

According to the Houston Police Department, the off-duty officers attempted to subdue Pean, and one deployed a Taser on him.
In a statement issued just after the shooting, the Houston Police Department described the incident as follows:
Officers Ortega and Law were working extra jobs as security at St. Joseph Medical Center at the above address when they were summoned to the eighth floor to help nurses subdue a combative patient. Once the officers arrived, the patient continued to refuse to comply with the nurses and officers' demands. The patient suddenly physically assaulted Officer Ortega, striking them in the head, causing a laceration. At that time, Officer Law deployed their conducted energy device, which had no apparent effect on the suspect who continued to assault the officers. Officer Ortega, fearing for their and theirs partner's safety, then discharged their duty weapon, striking the suspect one time.

Both officers were given three days of administrative leave after the incident, the department told Fusion. Both reportedly were given medical treatment for wounds sustained during the struggle.
The department's description of Pean as "combative," and as a "suspect" in particular has drawn the ire of mental-health professionals following the case.
"We stand in outrage for every time they are referred to as 'combative' without sub-clause or context, we stand in outrage for every time they are called a 'suspect' instead of a patient, we stand in outrage for every time he, one empty-handed, help-seeking man, is painted as a threat to two officers, able bodied and armed, in a hospital," continues the joint statement mentioned above.

A quarter of the people who have been shot and killed by police in the first half of this year were "in the throes of mental or emotional crisis", found an analysis by the Washington Post. Several cases in which people have been shot and killed by officers have happened during the very moments when the individuals or their families were seeking to get them treatment for their conditions.
In Miami Gardens, Fl., 25-year-old Lavall Hall was shot and killed by an officer in the street after their mother called the police to help readmit them into the mental health hospital they had just been released from. “Why did they take my child's life when I called for help?” their mother asked at the time. A police dashcam video that was later released in that case showed their mother pleading for officers not to hurt their child just moments before the shooting. That case is still open, and a wrongful death lawsuit against the city has been filed by the family.
Separately, in Dallas, a police body cam video released this year showed last year's police shooting of Jason Harrison, whose mother called the authorities to help get them mental health treatment. Only 13 seconds pass in the video before an officer fired a fatal shot into Harrison, with their mother only a few steps away. A grand jury neglected to indict the officer involved in the shooting in April. The family has filed a wrongful death lawsuit.

On Sunday night, a video of Pean was posted online, shortly after they regained consciousness.
"I love you all, thank you for praying for me. It's made a huge difference, and I can't wait to hug each and every one of you guys," Pean says, fighting back tears.

Want to know what�s happening in Ohio government and politics from Columbus to Washington, D.C.? The Columbus Dispatch has you covered.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich has not been shy in saying that if doesn�t see a change with Republican presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump, they won�t be supporting him.
So far, Kasich, who dropped out of the presidential race last month, hasn�t seen that change.
What they said: �I�m waiting to see if at this point there�s going to be a Damascus Road experience, a dramatic change,� Kasich told Yahoo political columnist Matt Bai. �And I haven�t seen it. You never know when it can happen. But without that, I won�t be involved.�
On Trump�s response to the Orlando shooting? �Terrible. It�s not the way you operate as a leader. Terrible. �I told you so�? What�s the magic of that? You know, who doesn�t know we are vulnerable to radical Islam? Everyone knows we are vulnerable to it.
�And then, to somehow insinuate that the president of the United States accepts this or condones this, it�s just outrageous.�
But can Trump get elected? �I don�t think they can get elected with this rhetoric, no,� Kasich said.
Meanwhile: While on MSNBC's Morning Joe this morning, Kasich there are people �who pound on me� to endorse Trump but they said �I�m not prepared to do it.�

The case against Sherrod Brown for VP: Nathaniel Rakich of the New Republic points out the reason why much-touted Sen. Sherrod Brown would not make a good vice presidential candidate for Hillary Clinton:
To many, Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown should be a frontrunner to be the Democratic nominee for vice president. They have credibility with the Bernie Sanders wing of the party, which Hillary Clinton must win over, and is from a swing state to boot. But that bonus is also their downfall. Under state law, if Brown becomes vice president, Governor John Kasich would appoint their replacement for the next two years. Kasich, of course, would undoubtedly choose a fellow Republican, handing the GOP a Senate seat that Democrats spent $40 million to hold onto in 2012.
Speaking of Sherrod Brown, part 1: Brown said they are confident Bernie Sanders, who has been running for the Democratic presidential nomination, will eventually back Clinton.
�I know them well enough to know that they will be full-throated with (the backing of) Hillary Clinton and the Democrats in November,� they said on Wednesday in a conference call with reporters.
Speaking of Sherrod Brown, part 2: Brown was one of a number of Democrats to take the Senate floor in a lengthy debate aiming to pressure Republicans to vote on gun control measures after the Orlando shooting, according to Washington bureau chief Jack Torry.
Brown read two letters from people in Ohio who want tougher gun laws. Brown read one letter from a gay man in Toledo who wrote they had �never been to a pride event. This year was going to be my year, and I am scared.�
Brown continued reading the letter in which the man asked, �Why is that it's harder to obtain a driver�s license than it is to buy a gun? . . . This shooting issue in our country is one that needs solved. It won't be solved by doing nothing.�

The Democratic platform: �This year's national Democratic platform will likely place a greater emphasis on gun-control and anti-hate crime measures because of the Orlando shootings, according to an Ohio lawmaker helping to draw up the document,� Cleveland.com�s Jeremy Pelzer writes.
State Rep. Alicia Reece, a Cincinnati Democrat serving on the DNC's platform drafting committee said, �gun control would be �a huge push in our platform,� as well as expanding the definition of hate crimes to protect victims targeted because of their sexual orientation,� Pelzer writes.

Kasich makes plea for Portman: Kasich is making good on their promise to help Republicans in Congress during this election year.
The Ohio governor sent out a �personal plea� on behalf of Sen. Rob Portman.
�We've made a lot of progress together in Ohio and we can't afford to go backwards�.Ohio desperately needs more leaders like Rob in the Senate. Rob and I have been friends for more than twenty years. We've worked together to combat Ohio's drug epidemic, restore fiscal responsibility and grow our economy,� Kasich writes.
Portman is in a tough re-election battle with former Ohio governor and Democrat Ted Strickland.
Kasich has also sent out a fundraising plea for John McCain and helped at a fundraiser for Rand Paul.
Meanwhile: Portman has released a new radio ad hitting Strickland. �Portman argues Strickland has forgotten the people who elected them and cites their stances on guns and coal as evidence that Strickland has veered left,� Dispatch Washington reporter Jessica Wehrman writes.
