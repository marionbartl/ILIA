Research on depression in adolescents in recent years has focused on how the physical brain and social experiences interact. A new University of California, Davis, study, however, shows that adolescents with large hippocampal volume were more, or less, susceptible to feelings of depression depending on how unsafe — or conversely — protected they felt in their home and community environments.
Hippocampal volume refers to the overall size of the hippocampus, a brain structure below the cerebral cortex. Traditionally, research has shown that a smaller hippocampus is implicated in depression, but this study showed that a larger hippocampus may indicate a greater ability for adolescents to take advantage of the support in their environments and overcome fear, anxiety and depression.

“As adolescents with more severe depressive symptoms are at greater risk of developing clinically diagnosed depressive disorders in adolescence and beyond, our results have important implications for prevention and intervention strategies. With this knowledge, we can better prevent and treat depressive symptoms in the teen years,” said Amanda Guyer, professor of human development and family studies with the UC Davis Center for Mind and Brain.  They are a co-author of the study.
The study also pointed out that as neuroimaging becomes more feasible in diagnosis, the findings could prove helpful in identifying individuals' risk for depression early on.
The research represents a significant step forward to better understanding the complex interactive role of biological and environmental factors in both risk and resilience to depressive symptoms, the study found.

The study looked at 209 youths, conducting scans of their brains in 11th or 12th grades. Researchers monitored youth for self-reported depression symptoms, looking at students' exposure to family connectedness — centered inside the home. Researchers also monitored youths' exposure to issues outside their home, such as crime in their community.
The teens involved in the study were of Mexican origin, a group which is a group at heightened risk for depression, the authors state.
The study, “Hippocampal Volume as Amplifier of Effect of Social Context on Adolescent Depression,” is co-authored by faculty from the UC Davis Center for Mind and Brain, and the departments of psychology and human ecology. It appeared May 13 in Clinical Psychological Science.
This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health; William T. Grant Foundation; National Science Foundation; UC Davis, including the Center for Poverty Research; and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Analysis.

For Republicans, it provides a concrete vehicle for pushing the argument that the government's response to the recession has been wasteful and ineffective, that the growing national debt requires deep spending cuts and that Mr. Obama is guilty of ideological overreach.
For Democrats, it is an opportunity to accuse Republicans of being obstructionist and out of touch with the pain caused by an economic downturn that began on the Republicans' watch.
Mr. Obama's tough attack on Monday signaled the White House's confidence that it has the upper hand, legislatively and politically. Recent public opinion polls show that a majority of Americans favor giving the long-term unemployed more financial help even if it adds to the deficit.
“To govern is to choose, and this is a clear choice: You either support extending benefits for people who are out of work or you don't,” said Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff. “There are obvious political ramifications to that difference.”
With many voters expressing growing alarm at the mounting national debt, Republicans say that standing against an unemployment extension that would add to the deficit could energize their voters and help them regain some of the reputation for fiscal responsibility they have lost in recent years. They also accused the White House of misleading the public about the Republican position on added jobless pay.
“The president knows that Republicans support extending unemployment insurance , and doing it in a fiscally responsible way by cutting spending elsewhere in the $3 trillion federal budget ,” Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio , the House Republican leader, said in a statement Monday. “At a time of record debt and deficits made worse by Washington Democrats' massive spending spree, that's the right thing to do and the right way to do it.”
The additional money for those who have exhausted their standard 26 weeks of jobless pay has been tied up since the beginning of June but had become a growing point of contention since February when Senator Jim Bunning , Republican of Kentucky , initiated a one-man filibuster against a temporary extension of the safety-net spending.

While Republicans eventually relented and allowed an additional month of unemployment compensation, the party began to coalesce around the position that further extensions should be paid for with offsetting cuts in other spending, leading to the current stalemate.

Most Democrats contend that deficit spending is acceptable — even, in economic terms, necessary — to help not only the jobless but also the economy as a whole. Their argument is that unemployed workers will spend all or nearly all of their benefits on goods and services that help support other jobs.
“At what point do we pivot and start being concerned about our children and our grandchildren?” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said Sunday on CNN. “There is no way in the world on a trillion-dollar budget this year we can't find the money to pay for an extension of unemployment insurance, something we're in favor of.”

Besides the support of Carte Goodwin, the West Virginian to be sworn on Tuesday to succeed Mr. Byrd, Democrats are counting on the votes of Senators Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe , the two Maine Republicans, to reach the minimum 60 votes needed to overcome the threat of a Republican filibuster.
To ease objections, Democrats have scaled back the unemployment proposal, which originally was to extend through December and included billions of dollars in health insurance subsidies for the unemployed.
In a floor speech Monday, Senator Harry Reid , the Nevada Democrat and majority leader, chastised Republicans for blocking the added unemployment benefits, noting that Republicans had voted before to treat the assistance as emergency spending that could be added to the deficit.
They also accused Republicans of being callous to the unemployed, noting that some Senate Republicans — as well as Senate candidates — have suggested that the added unemployment pay amounts to welfare and is discouraging people from taking jobs when they can rely on the government.
“Many of my constituents take offense at these absurd allegations, and they've let me know about it,” Mr. Reid said. “They've written or called me or pulled me aside when I see them in Nevada.”
If the Senate is successful in approving the extension, the House will have to vote on the measure before it is sent to the president, but Democrats have sufficient votes there.

The potential impact on Congressional races was evident Monday.
In one case, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee issued a statement noting that Dan Coats , the Republican Senate candidate in Indiana , had backed Republican efforts to block the jobless pay unless it was offset with cuts elsewhere.
“Due to Republican obstructionism, over 48,000 unemployed Hoosiers have already lost their unemployment benefits,” the Democratic statement said.
Republicans fired back, criticizing Representative Brad Ellsworth, the Democratic Senate candidate, for their support of deficit spending on unemployment pay.
“Instead of making the tough economic decisions that every Indiana family and small business face each day, Brad Ellsworth has been sitting in Washington maxing out the government credit card and doing nothing to get more Hoosiers back to work,” said Brian Walsh, a spokesperson for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
It's May 2014, and Future Islands frontman Samuel T Herring is about to board a 6am flight to Barcelona. He's running on empty. The night before in Vienna, they skip dinner, gets drunk after a show, meets up with a long-lost friend and stays up reminiscing until 4am.
Standing in line at the airport, they start to experience a panic attack. Trying to distract himself, they fixate on a German mother and their son in the queue. “His mom was fixing their shirt and combing their hair, while they were swatting away at them They were crying. It was like they were leaving home. I'm watching this guy like, ‘Fuck this guy! Give them a hug! I wish I could hug my mom right now!'”
“I've got these panic waves hitting, top of my head to my toes,” they continue. “And I just turn our tour manager and go, ‘Hey, I'm about to pass out.' I'm stripping off my bag and taking off my coat. And then bam. I hit the ground. I immediately come to, stand back up and hit the ground again straight away.”

By 2014 all three members of Future Islands were ready to collapse. Their performance of “Seasons (Waiting For You)” on The Late Show with David Letterman exploded online, hundreds of thousands sharing footage of Herring's signature dance moves – somewhere between a velociraptor on the prowl and Marlon Brando doing karaoke, for those who haven't seen it.
These relative old-timers from Baltimore, who'd be touring non-stop for years with everything on their terms, were catapulted into another world. What followed isn't a miserable tale of underdogs being ruined by the big time. In fact, new album The Far Field, the band's fifth, is the opposite of a group caving into pressure. But bassist William Cashion admits that their entire world changed. “Everything got bigger. The stages got bigger, the crowds got bigger, the expectations got bigger.”
Since finding unexpected success, there hasn't been a story quite like theirs – a band who'd carved their own niche suddenly being placed on a huge platform by simply doing what they always do. Overnight success doesn't tend to happen, especially not to an art-rock group from Baltimore.
“To me, we've been successful for years. Since 2010,” argues Herring. “We were already living off of our art. To me, that was success.” But with 2014 album Singles, they became a different band, adding touring drummer Michael Lowry to their entourage and playing huge slots on the back of that Letterman performance. What was intended to be one year on the road soon became two. “We're used to steady touring,” says Cashion, but 2015 saw them spending a handful of days back home before flying off to another festival, week-in, week-out. This was anything but steady.
“The road” has been a sticking point on all Future Islands records, both in a literal and metaphorical sense. Before The Far Field, the group's relationship with life on the road changed, and the following record documents this. Standout track “Beauty Of The Road” finds Herring looking back on the time they sacrificed their love life in order to tour. Writing the latest record, they became uncomfortable with not being on the road.
“I missed it. It became a nostalgic point. I'm pretty deeply invested in my love of the road. But I don't know if that's because I've completely lost my mind,” they laugh, eyes widening. They look to their bandmates. “That does scare me, because these guys have wonderful people in their lives and are settling down. I'm like, ‘What happened to me?!' I'm still lost out here on these roads. I'll fly to LA just to stay in a hotel room because that feels more at home than being at my house.”
A lot of those drawn to Herring's dancing found appeal in someone putting their insecurities to one side and just going for it. Others simply found it funny. Gifs of Herring's moves became a strange, low-key meme that threatened to forever follow the band.
But the real appeal of the frontman's stage prowess is how much commitment they give. You see it in the dramatic chest thumps, or when emotion overwhelms and they begin to cry – he's all in. “Being at home and realising I'd got everything I set out to get,” they reflect. “I'd fulfilled all my goals: to be a musician. I didn't have to do anything but make music. And if I wasn't making music or touring, then I could just be. I didn't need to worry about working another job. And I found myself in 2016 with that situation exactly, and I felt so lonely.”
They say all this with a smile on their face, and it doesn't help that he's been doing interviews for three days straight in Paris, Amsterdam and London. But he's being deadly serious. “I'd accomplished my goals and I was as lonely as I was when I started! It's like, ‘You sacrificed love for your art, you found out where that took you. Time to reset'. I had to go one way or another, though.”
“Me and Gerrit [Welmers] also get totally stir crazy,” adds Cashion, who booked the band's first 500 shows on their own (they hit the 1,000 milestones in 2015 with a gig in North Carolina). You can't prepare anyone for the phenomenon that hit in 2015, but being a motivated, self-starting band since 2006 helped put Future Islands in the driving seat when heads began to turn.
“There are too many people who wait around for a label and a booking agent. If you want to do something, just do it. We subscribe to that fully,” says Herring, although Cashion stresses that “you need to work with others” when opportunity knocks. “But I would say, people can do everything on their own completely. So if there's any young bands reading this, go for it. Don't wait for anybody else.”
It's this self-sufficient ethos that informs The Far Field, a record that paves new ground – they collaborate for Blondie's Debbie Harry on “Shadows”, for instance – but still sticks rigidly to a signature sound developed over the previous four albums. One thing's clear: for all the exhaustion, loss and longing that's defined the past couple of years, Future Islands don't want things to go back to normal. They're driven by playing to bigger crowds and winning over new fans.
Herring cites a conversation with current label 4AD, who took the band on before they released Singles in 2014. “They said, ‘You've done all of the hard work. And we love what you do. We don't want to change anything you're doing, we just want to give you a bigger platform.' They let more people know we existed, and that's all we needed.”

(CNN) The man shot to death by police in Mesa, Arizona, struggled with more than Asperger's syndrome.
Kayden Clarke was transitioning from female to male, they said in a YouTube video, but faced obstacles because of Asperger's, a high-functioning variant of autism
One doctor refused to prescribe testosterone until their Asperger's was cured, they said on a video . "You can't cure neurological disorders!" they railed.
Clarke also said they had other mental problems, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and cognitive disorders. They said he'd attempted suicide, including "suicide by cop."
Clarke was shot to death Thursday when Mesa police answered a call about a suicidal woman, Detective Estaban Flores said at a Friday news briefing. Two officers were talking to the person through an open door in a hallway when that person emerged and lunged at the officers with a large kitchen knife, they said.
"At that point they felt their lives were threatened," Flores said. Both officers fired their weapons, they said.
Police identified the person shot to death as Danielle Jacobs, 24.
CNN generally uses the name and pronoun preferred by transgender individuals, regardless of their gender at birth.
Police said they didn't know they were dealing with a person with Asperger's or any mental problems, Flores said. They didn't mention the person was transgender
CNN was unaware Clarke was transgender on Friday when another article was published about the killing
'My daughter died asking for help'
Clarke's mother, Stacia, told CNN affiliate KPHO that police overreacted. They said nobody was in danger from their child, whom they referred to using the feminine.
"My daughter died for asking for help," they said Friday. "She was in their own place. And regardless of what they were thinking, what they were doing, they aren't posing a danger to the community. There has to be a better way for law enforcement to respond and handle situations."
Clarke was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome in 2013, reported KPHO.
People with Asperger's are often exceptionally intelligent and verbally gifted, but they also can be socially awkward.
They may react to stress differently and at times more emotionally than others not on the autism spectrum.
A life shared on social media
Like many people their age, Clarke shared life through social media.
They posted YouTube videos under the name Danielle Jacobs about the problems of having Asperger's syndrome.
Last June, one video showed a breakdown in which Clarke wept, berated themselves and punched their chest as Samson, their service Rottweiler, jumped up to block the blows. Finally, they slumped to the floor and embraced the dog.
In one YouTube video they described "stimming" -- self-stimulating behavior such as patting the chest. They read text from a cellphone and explained the odd, repetitive motions.
"I'm trying to calm myself from being overwhelmed," they said.
In another video they sob and says he's distraught about learning vocational education workers wouldn't continue to support their quest for a college education.
"They kept leading me on and leading me on," they said.
Police didn't know 'her mental and cognitive abilities'
Clarke and police had one previous interaction, Flores said -- a call in which they complained about Internet harassment.
"Other than that we had no indication of who they were or what their mental and cognitive abilities were at that time," Flores said.
After receiving the call Thursday, officers went to the house and were let inside by one of Clarke's friends, Flores said.
While the two officers -- one with training in crisis intervention -- talked to Clarke, a third went to their police vehicle to obtain a "less than lethal" device, such as a bean-bag shotgun, Flores said.
Before that officer returned, Clarke came out of the door with a knife with an 8-inch blade, they said.
They told them to drop the weapon but Clarke "lunged extending the knife toward the officers from a very close distance," they said.
No body cameras
Neither officer wore body cameras, they said. Both had stunned guns but those devices "sometimes become ineffective when someone starts moving a lot," they said.
Flores said the Mesa department had already increased the number of officers with training in crisis intervention.
"Officers receive enhanced training, focusing on how to identify and assist in situations involving individuals suffering from mental illness and cognitive disabilities," they said.
The officers were placed on administrative leave.
"At this time we express our sympathies to Danielle's family and their friend's," Flores said. "Obviously they're going through a tough time right now -- it's tough losing somebody like this."
The closest astronomers have come to directly “seeing” a black hole happened last year, when the LIGO observatory detected the spacetime-warping gravitational waves radiating from a pair of black holes that collided some 1.3 billion years ago.
That's cool. But for astronomers, it's not enough. What's eluded them is a view of the event horizon, the boundary of the black hole from which, when crossed, there is no return. After the event horizon, gravity is so intense that not even light can escape.
We've never seen a direct image of a black hole. But if an audacious experiment called the Event Horizon Telescope is successful, we'll see one for the first time.
Why we've never seen an image of a black hole
The biggest problem with trying to detect a black hole is that even the supermassive ones in the center of galaxies is relatively tiny.
"The largest one in the sky [is] the black hole in the center of the Milky Way," Dimitrios Psaltis, an astrophysicist at the University of Arizona, said in 2015. "And taking a picture of it would be equivalent to taking a picture of a DVD on the surface of the moon."
What's more, because of their strong gravity, black holes tend to be surrounded by other bright matter in the process of being torn to bits. And it makes the actual dark spot hard to see.
That's why when hunting for black holes, astronomers don't usually try for direct observation. Instead, they look for evidence of the effects of a black hole's gravity and radiation.
“We typically measure the orbits of stars and gas that seem to circle around very dark 'spots' in the sky and measure how much mass is there in that dark spot,” Psaltis says. "If we know of no other astrophysical object that can be so massive and so dark as what we just measured, we consider this as very strong evidence that a black hole lies there."
Here's a visualization of that concept:
You're looking at 20 years of data on the stars that live near the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, called Sagittarius A. The stars, some many times more massive than our sun, are orbiting it.
“These orbits, and a simple application of Kepler's Laws, provide the best evidence yet for a supermassive black hole, which has a mass of 4 million times the mass of the Sun,” explains UCLA's Galactic Center Group, which produced the animation.
Here's another look at the same phenomenon. This video includes 16 years of images from the European Southern Observatory. This isn't an animation; it's real images of stars sped up by a factor of 32 million. Watch them dance around a mysterious blank center. There's no known object other than a black hole that could force such massive stars into orbit.
And it's this black hole — the mysterious Sagittarius A — that astronomers just might take a picture of in the coming days.
How the Event Horizon Telescope works
Because Sagittarius A is so small, and surrounded by so much occluding material, it's going to take a huge telescope to see it. According to Nature, it would take a telescope 1,000 times more powerful than Hubble to get enough resolution to see it.
So how does the Event Horizon Telescope solve this problem? Conventional optical telescopes use bigger and bigger mirrors to see objects smaller and farther away in the universe. The Event Horizon Telescope is doing something similar: It's creating a virtual telescope the size of the entire Earth.
The Event Horizon team is connecting radio telescopes at eight locations across the world — as far-flung as Hawaii and the South Pole — and instructing them all to look toward Sagittarius A for a few days. The network is the result of an international collaboration of 14 research institutions across the world.
These telescopes look like giant satellite dishes, and rather than picking up visible light like the telescopes you may have used in a backyard, they're sensitive to radio frequencies, which our eyes can't see. Astronomers will often take the radio telescope data and convert it to images our eyes can see.
Together, these eight telescopes have the power to “count the stitches on a baseball from 8,000 miles away,” as MIT explains. (The array will generate such a huge amount of data that it's more efficient to fly the data from each of the telescopes to a centralized location than it is to transfer it over the internet. Data processing will take place at both the Max Planck Institute in Bonn, Germany, and the Haystack Observatory in Massachusetts.)
Event Horizon came online April 4, and it is expected to run until April 14. Along with observing Sagittarius A, it will also take a look at the supermassive black hole in the galaxy Messier 87, which is about 1,500 times more massive than Sag A.
But why bother?
Astronomers want to find the event horizon because 1) it's freaking awesome, but also 2) in this extreme accretion disc region, Einstein's 100-year-old theory of gravitation is put to the ultimate test. Supermassive black holes like Sag A also generate huge plumes of material that can extend the entire length of galaxies. Understanding how these plumes are generated will help astronomers understand how galaxies evolve. Scientists can also use the image to better test the idea of “Hawking radiation,” which suggests black holes are actually slowly losing mass over time.
But most of all, the direct imaging of a black hole will prove that studying even the most mysterious and powerful forces in the universe isn't beyond our grasp.
Using a complicated technique called Very Long Baseline Interferometry, astronomers will be able to combine the data into one astronomical observation, and hopefully produce an unclouded image of a black hole.
The resulting image might show a dark spot surrounded by an accretion disk — a bright ring of matter that swirls around it. The disc will appear like a halo, as Nature explains:
Contrary to most artistic depictions of black holes, the accretion disk does not disappear behind the object the way Saturn's rings can partly hide behind the planet. Around a black hole, there's no hiding: gravity warps space-time, and here the effect is so extreme that light rays go around the black hole, showing multiple distorted images of what lies behind it. This should make the accretion disk appear to wrap around the black hole's shadow like a halo
It may be months before the Event Horizon team assembles and publishes the image. And success is not assured: Even radio telescopes need clear skies to get an uninterrupted view of the heavens. But if it does succeed, it will be a huge success for astronomy, physics, and the power of worldwide collaboration.
Correction: A previous version of this post said the radio telescopes can pick up on a broad range of electromagnetic radiation, including ultraviolet and gamma radiation. This is wrong. These telescopes are only searching for radio frequencies.
The weather is a dance between an odd couple: the frantic atmosphere and the staid sea. The atmosphere changes quickly, as when a strong wind suddenly starts to blow or a cyclone careens ashore. The ocean seems more sedate. Its wide gyres trace the edges of continents, carrying sun-warmed water from the equator out towards the poles. Even the rough storms that terrorize sailors are more the sky's fault than the sea's. The waves that toss a ship are whipped up by the wind.
But it turns out that the ocean makes its own gestures; it just makes them very slowly. Enormous vortices of water, measuring 60 miles across, spin their way across the sea at a deliberate pace—3 miles per day. Oceanographers have dubbed them mesoscale eddies for their middle size, larger than a wake formed by an aircraft carrier and smaller than a gyre. Each one is like an upside down mountain of water, held together by its own rotation and extending about 3,000 feet beneath the surface. In the video above, eddies show up as red and blue dots dancing around. (Red ones spin clockwise, blue ones counterclockwise.) Just how much water gets carried around by all these eddies? The total is staggering: more than 30 times the amount dumped by all the world's rivers into the ocean, according to a paper published today in Science. Other stuff gets caught in the vortices and taken along for the ride. This huge network of eddies may be shipping packets of pollutants, organic nutrients, and dissolved carbon all around the world.
These eddies are almost invisible unless you look from space. For decades, oceanographers have been tracking eddies using NASA satellites. By bouncing a pulse of radar off the surface of the water and recording the time it takes to return, the satellites can measure their distance from the water to within less than an inch. This astounding accuracy turns out to be necessary, since unlike the deep ship-swallowing whirlpools of Greek mythology, the depression at the center of an eddy is a mere 20 inches.
To reconstruct the 3-D structure of the eddies and find their volume, a team of oceanographers led by Bo Qiu of the University of Hawaii used data from underwater floats. More than 3,000 ARGO submersibles are scattered around the globe, lurking under the surface. Each comes to the surface every 10 days to report the water temperature, salt content, density, and velocity. An eddy, once born, might travel for months or years before dissipating. By combining a decade of satellite and submersible data, the researchers were able to track the incredible mass of water collectively moved by eddies across the entire world. Qiu's calculations surprised even him.
"We didn't expect the number to be that high," they said. "We know they propagate westward, and there are a lot of eddies. But the mass… there's an order of magnitude more than we expected."
Previously, it was thought that the steady currents like the Gulf Stream were almost entirely responsible for moving stuff through the ocean. The ocean transports trash, nutrients, radioactive waste, dissolved carbon dioxide and heat all around the world, and the latter two are especially important for understanding climate change. Qiu's study raises the possibility that eddies also make a substantial contribution to these transports.
This paper will kick off a wave of research among climate modelers, says Ryan Abernathey, who studies the impact of ocean circulation on climate at Columbia University. "The volume estimate is really surprising," they said. "This is an important effect. The next question is how leaky the eddy is." The eddy is made of water, after all, and the difference between inside and outside is not precise. If, say, the dissolved carbon caught in an eddy slowly slips out, then after a year of meandering an eddy may have left its original contents an ocean away. But if the eddies hold their cargo tightly, they might be shipping enormous packages of carbon, salt, and pollutants from Australia to Africa and from Europe to America. Scientists are now trying to figure out how the packages effect local ecosystems and the planet's climate.
A Reddit user wants to give back to a former teacher by helping out their daughter.
Lara Casalotti, 24, suffers from rapidly progressing acute myeloid leukemia, and they need a stem cell transplant to save their lives.
Unfortunately, finding a genetic match for them has been difficult. Casalotti is Chinese-Thai and Italian, and less than 3 percent of registered donors are mixed race. Of that small percentage, “only a fraction of [the registered donors] are an Asian-European mix most likely to match with Lara,” according to match4lara, a website created by Casalotti's family to help find a donor.
“All of us in the family wanted so badly to be the match. I must have hit the refresh button a hundred times on the online test results page, before finally getting my markers. They didn't match. None of ours do.”
That's why redditor Yasmeenaccounts posted about the family's situation in the Videos community, trying to spread the word and find an acceptable donor.
“Please, can you guys help?” Yasmeenaccounts wrote in the post. “He was honestly such a nice teacher and I really want to help their family.”
People interested in helping Casalotti and finding if they're a genetic match can join a bone marrow registry. The match4lara website has links to registries in the US, Great Britain, and other countries, and matches are found by taking a cheek swab or saliva sample from volunteers. Even if an individual isn't a match for Casalotti, they might be a match for one of the 12,000 other people in need of a donation.
Oh for God's sake: Time magazine is doing its annual reader poll of words and phrases that should be "banned" from the English language, and alongside worthy contenders like "disrupt" and "said no one ever," they've included the word "feminist." And because this is the Internet, guess which word is winning?
Time is taking a hearty beating on Twitter for this year's version of the banned words poll, which right now shows "feminist" winning with 45 percent of the vote, well ahead of current second place contender "bae."
The blurb by reporter Katy Steinmetz making the case for banning "feminist" doesn't exactly reassure us:
You have nothing against feminism itself, but when did it become a thing that every celebrity had to state their position on whether this word applies to them, like some politician declaring a party? Let's stick to the issues and quit throwing this label around like ticker tape at a Susan B. Anthony parade.
Yes, why does everyone have to talk about feminism? Why can't we all just be feminists quietly? At home? Only very late at night when everybody's sleeping? Or like in our teeny tiniest voices? Or in a soundproof hyperbaric chamber, maybe, where it won't, like, bother anybody?

Ok, maybe that's not quite fair, but making a case for banning a word that refers to a mass social movement alongside the nonsense phrase "om nom nom" is pretty stupid. So stupid we suspected it's the work of 4Chan's /b/ board, and we were correct. Over at /b/, the Internet's home for barely potty-trained trolls, everyone's being encouraged to vote for "feminist," with one user declaring, brightly, "Let's trigger some bitches."
When the numbers started to drop, another user said, "We're back down to 38%, Pick up the slack guys."

So now that we've solved that mystery, how is the author of the poll responding to the controversy? Predictably, by saying that the furor over the poll was taking it "out of context."
Let's all do a better job anticipating obvious things before they bite us in the ass. Especially you, Time.

Update, 7:00 p.m.:
Looks like we can't pin this one on 4chan alone — a tipster points out that 9gag, another troll emporium, also decided to get in on the fun. Here's a screenshot they sent us:

Flat Design: Why you should question Nielsen Norman's research on the trendy design style.
Sean Dexter Blocked Unblock Follow Sep 18, 2017
The Nielsen Norman Group is probably the most influential usability consultancy in the design industry. So, when they publish an article about their research findings titled “Flat UI Elements Attract Less Attention and Cause Uncertainty”, many designers perk up and pay attention.
In the few days after the article's release I've already seen it shared several times as evidence of the weaknesses of flat as an interface aesthetic. But there's a problem with that conclusion.
It's not actually supported by the study that was done.
So what's the issue? Let's take a look at the very beginning of the article:
The popularity of flat design in digital interfaces has coincided with a scarcity of signifiers. Many modern UIs have ripped out the perceptible cues that users rely on to understand what is clickable.
While the title had clearly set the expectation that “flat design” was the subject of the research, the article immediately jumps in to an equivocation between flat design and design with “weak or absent signifiers”. It turns out the latter was actually the focus of the study even though we were promised the former.
Leaving aside the issues with calling anything “weak” before actually running the study, one might still expect (based on the title of the article) that the weak signifier scenarios tested were reasonably representative of flat design. However, a deeper dive into the full set of designs tested shows this was not true in most cases. Five of the nine scenarios asked users to find text links that differed only in how they were styled and colored.

Look for O'Donoghue to appear in Season 2's fourth episode. It might be safe to assume the role will be recurring, considering Captain Hook was featured in the Season 2 trailer. O'Donoghue's other credits include "The Rite" and "The Tudors."
O'Donoghue's Captain Hook will be stylish and will posses some old-school manners, but he'll be just as conniving as viewers familiar with the classic character have come to know him. Other Season 2 guest stars include Jamie Chung as Mulan and Sarah Bolger as Princess Aurora.

With the race to the White House heating up, it raises the question: where do the presidential candidates stand on global warming? In short, Obama is a global warming “believer” but has provided little substance to back their conviction and seldom talks about it. Romney, on the other hand, presents a wavering, sometimes mocking assessment on the severity of the issue.
Obama
In nearly four years in office, Obama has occasionally paid lip service to the “threat of climate change”, but has yet to use their bully pulpit to lay out the scientific case in a high-profile setting. They once in a while mentions climate change in passing, but has yet to discuss its causes, the evidence, and potential impacts in detail.
As a perfect example, at a speech in Charlottesville, Va. last week, Obama's token reference to climate change was: “Denying climate change doesn't make it stop.”
Obama has passed up opportunity after opportunity to discuss climate change science, including during their last State of the Union address.
For its part, the Democratic national platform fails to provide any detail about the science in its discussion of climate policy. It calls climate change “one of the biggest threats of this generation” and says it “affirm[s] the science of climate change”. But there's no information about the specific risks climate change poses.
“The Obama Administration has never really tried to do much on the topic of climate change,” Michigan State sociology professor Aaron McCright told Discovery. “So, while protecting the environment and dealing with climate change is part of the general Democratic platform, it is not something that Obama has specifically pushed in their original campaign or at any time during their presidency.”
Romney
Romney's position on climate change science has shifted around as Brad Plumer documents on the Wonk Blog:
As recently as June 2011, Romney was telling voters in New Hampshire that “the world's getting warmer,” that “I believe that humans contribute,” and that “I think it's important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases.”
Since then, however, Romney has softened their stance. “I don't know if [rising temperatures are] mostly caused by humans,” they told another New Hampshire crowd last summer.
The website ScienceDebate.org, sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences and other scientific organizations, has posed questions on 14 science policy issues to both presidential candidates. Romney's comments on climate change science in their response to the question on climate policy, offers their clearest take on the issue I've seen yet:
I am not a scientist myself, but my best assessment of the data is that the world is getting warmer, that human activity contributes to that warming, and that policymakers should therefore consider the risk of negative consequences. However, there remains a lack of scientific consensus on the issue — on the extent of the warming, the extent of the human contribution, and the severity of the risk — and I believe we must support continued debate and investigation within the scientific community.
Ultimately, the science is an input to the public policy decision; it does not dictate a particular policy response.
(Obama did not address the science in their response)
Despite Romney's thoughtful response, their much-publicized mockery of Obama's promise to slow sea level rise last week calls into question whether they take the issue seriously.
“President Obama promised to slow the rise of the oceans — [bites lip and pauses for audience laughter(!)] — and to heal the planet,” Romney said at the Republican National Convention (RNC). “MY promise is to help you and your family.”
ThinkProgress writes the Obama camp responded to Romney's comment with this scathing response:
It is nothing short of terrifying to imagine a party that openly mocks climate change taking back the White House.
Language in the GOP platform further suggests climate is not high on the Romney/Republican agenda. It does not explicitly discuss climate change except to criticize Obama for classifying it as a national security concern. It says:
...the [Obama] strategy ... elevates “climate change” to the level of a “severe threat” equivalent to foreign aggression. The word “climate,” in fact, appears in the current President's strategy more often than Al Qaeda, nuclear proliferation, radical Islam, or weapons of mass destruction...
Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, has gone as far to challenge the motives of climate scientists who have published academic papers on manmade warming. Wonkbook's Brad Plumer writes:
Ryan's suggestion that scientists have tried to “intentionally mislead the public” is a charge without much evidence.
Summary
Neither candidate has made talking about the science of climate change and the risks it presents a priority. Obama purports to take the issue very seriously but appears unwilling or afraid to address the issue substantively front and center. Romney is a moving target on the issue but their RNC speech and choice of running mate make clear they have significant reservations about the seriousness of the risks posed by global warming.

The Hot:
While the pre-camp short list of potential newcomers to the Arizona Coyotes squad didn't include this Ontario native, an inspiring string of preseason performances, including four goals in six games, landed the centerman a spot on the opening night roster. Yotes fans hope to see the same level of tenacity and production carry over into the regular season.
2. 22-14-44
Of all the potential line combinations displayed during preseason play, that of Brandon McMillan, B.J. Crombeen and Joe Vitale may have been the most promising. Not simply a group willing take the body, the Canadian and two Americans were also able to generate a significant amount of offense.
3. IceArizona's wallet
If the potential deal for Andrew Barroway to purchase a 51 percent stake in the Coyotes comes to fruition, IceArizona, who originally bought the team for $170 million in 2013, would make a nice profit given the franchise's current $305 million valuation. They would also still own 49 percent of the team. Not a bad deal.
4. Youngsters' shootout moves
Although they won't be suiting up for the Yotes on Thursday night at Gila River Arena, Max Domi and Henrik Samuelsson both got chances to show off their stick skills during preseason shootouts. Check out Domi's move in the interview below, if you haven't already:
5. The OHL's London Knights
Although Domi certainly created some buzz during their time in camp this time around, the Yotes coaching and management ultimately decided they should continue to develop at the junior level. Knights fans could be heard rejoicing upon hearing the news that their 93-point scorer from last season would return for another year.
The Not-so-Hot:
1. The Coyotes "youth movement"
Many Coyotes fans hoped (expected, even) that a few young players might make this year's opening day roster in an attempt to jolt the offense. Those hopes were effectively extinguished when Domi, Lucas Lessio and Tobias Rieder were all cut from camp on the same day, proving once again that young Coyotes players will not be rushed to the spotlight.
2. Third-line center
If Sam Gagner does in fact join Martin Hanzal and Martin Erat on the second line as a winger, the 3C spot will become a nightly adventure for the Coyotes coaching staff. Most would not consider Kyle Chipchura, a likely candidate, talented enough to assume the role and the minutes. Vitale fits too nicely on the fourth line, and Hodgman would really need to break out as an offensive threat to secure the spot.
3. Gary Bettman's haters
As SB Nation's Joe Yerdon put it in their article on October 3rd, "Gary Bettman may just be a genius." The NHL's commissioner effectively secured the fate of the Coyotes franchise, even if its future home remains uncertain, by attracting Barroway as a potential new investor. They will undoubtedly still be booed at public appearances, but they now have one less problem with which to deal.
4. Paul "BizNasty" Bissonette
The former Coyote and fan-favorite was recently released from their professional tryout with the St. Louis Blues, leaving the 29-year-old Canadian's NHL future unclear. Perhaps more free time will create an influx of quality twitter content? Regardless, we here at FFH wish them the best.
5. Mark Donnelly, Canucks anthem singer
In case you missed it, Donnelly put on a memorable performance of "O Canada" before a BCHL game in Vancouver on Friday night. Here it is, for your viewing pleasure:
Hacking Team, the creator of a digital remote-access and surveillance platform, had specifically targeted Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to allow government officials and law-enforcement agencies (LEAs) to follow the money, according to email messages stolen from the company in a breach earlier this month.
The messages, posted publicly by Wikileaks, indicated that the company's platform for compromising and monitoring targets' computers, known as the Remote Control System, gained new functionality in 2014 to track the use of Bitcoin, LiteCoin, Feathercoin and Namecoin. The software update allowed the copying of the target's wallet, transaction history and contact information.
Hacking Team focused on Bitcoin and three other cryptocurrencies as tools criminals used to launder money, despite efforts to foster legitimate markets for the digital money.
"Cryptocurrencies are a way to make untraceable transactions, and we all know that criminals love to easily launder, move and invest black money," Daniele Milan, operations manager for Hacking Team, stated in one email hosted by Wikileaks. "LEAs, by using our Intelligence module combined with this new capability, can correlate the usage of cryptocurrencies, defeating the financial opacity they provide."
In early July, hackers took control of the Milan, Italy-based Hacking Team's Twitter feed, announcing that they had breached the company's network and stolen 400 gigabytes of sensitive business communications and email messages. The company decried the attack, calling it a criminal act.
"Make no mistake about it, what happened earlier this summer in the attack on our company was a reckless and vicious crime," David Vincenzetti, CEO of Hacking Team, said in a statement on July 14. "We have reported it to Italian authorities who are investigating, and we expect the authorities of other nations to be involved as well."
The company developed a module, dubbed "Money," for its platform that could search for cryptocurrency data on a compromised system, according to emails. The inclusion of cryptocurrency tracking functionality in the software is unsurprising, given law enforcement's interest in Bitcoin, Andrew Conway, a research analyst with messaging security firm Cloudmark, told eWEEK.
"Drug purchases, illegal goods purchases, unlicensed gambling, and one we see all the time, ransomware, is facilitated by Bitcoin," they said. "Obviously, if you are in law enforcement, you are interested in these transactions, because Bitcoin is an annoyance and will end up being more than an annoyance."
The most interesting fallout from the Hacking Team breach is the sudden disclosure of a handful of highly critical vulnerabilities: three in Adobe Flash, one in Internet Explorer and another in Oracle's Java. The company that brokered the sale of one of the Adobe Flash vulnerabilities to Hacking Team shut down its program for buying and selling vulnerabilities following the revelation that Hacking Team had done business with Sudan and Egypt.
"The Hacking Team breach proved that we could not sufficiently vet the ethics and intentions of new buyers," Adriel Desautels, CEO of Netragard, said in a blog post. "Hacking Team unbeknownst to us until after their breach was clearly selling their technology to questionable parties, including but not limited to parties known for human rights violations."
Desautels argued that the market for zero-day vulnerabilities needs to be held to a legal standard in which each company that buys or sells the information is accountable for the use of the technology.
"It's important that the regulations do not target zero-days specifically but instead target those who acquire and use them," they said.
FRISCO, Texas - Dallas Stars General Manager Jim Nill announced today organizational changes in the club's hockey operations department. Les Jackson has been elevated to Senior Advisor to the General Manager, while Scott White and Mark Janko have each been promoted to Assistant General Manager.
Jackson, 63, will begin their 29th season with the organization, dating back to the Minnesota North Stars days. They most recently served as the team's Assistant General Manager. In their new role as Senior Advisor to the General Manager, they will work closely with Nill on a variety of assignments. They will observe and evaluate talent from the amateur and professional ranks all around the world and serve as counsel regarding the draft, free agency and trades.
White, 48, has been a member of the Stars organization since 2005, most recently as the team's Director of Hockey Operations for the past three seasons. They will assist in all matters pertaining to player evaluation, trades and free agent signings, reporting directly to Nill. White will also continue their role as the General Manager of the Texas Stars, Dallas' top development affiliate in the American Hockey League.  They are the only General Manager in the history of Texas, leading them to two Calder Cup Finals, winning in 2014.
Janko, 40, will begin their 17th season with the organization, spending the last eight in the hockey operations department. They will oversee all aspects of the team's salary cap and structure, serve as an architect to all player and staff contract negotiations, continue their work as the team's liaison for all player transactions with NHL Central Registry, and work with the League on all preseason and regular season scheduling matters. Their last three seasons were spent as the team's Director of Hockey Administration.
How to defeat the ancient Jedi mind trick known as HTTP Request Smuggling.
HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) is not a new technique; it's been around since 2005. It takes advantage of architectures where one or more intermediaries (proxies) are deployed between the client and the server. HRS is can be used to poison web-caches and bypass security solutions such as web application firewalls as well as for the delivery of malicious payloads such as worms, viruses, and those used to exploit known vulnerabilities in web and application servers.
The good news is that to exploit HRS, according to OWASP, "some specific conditions must exist, such as the presence of specific proxy system and version such as SunOne Proxy 3.6 (SP4) or FW-1/FP4-R55W beta or an XSS vulnerability in the web server." The "in the web server" should more correctly read "in a page or application hosted on the web server", as it is through a traditional XSS vulnerability in a web page/application that such attacks can be carried out if they are passed on by an intermediary.
The bad news is that the nature of cloud computing and virtualized architectures makes an attack based on HRS more likely to find "some specific conditions" than when it was first discovered. This is because intermediaries (proxies) are a fact of life in cloud and virtualized architectures. The variety of intermediaries used - both commercial and custom-built - to architect such environments increases the possibility that one or more of them will be vulnerable to HRS. And as Jeremiah Grossman tirelessly points out 82% of websites have at least one security flaw, and XSS is high in probability to be that one flaw.
The likelihood of being vulnerable to HRS is increased by the use of HTTP pipelining and without careful consideration and inspection of HTTP headers and payloads even security devices designed to prevent web application attacks may be vulnerable themselves.
HRS works by exploiting the way in which HTTP endpoints parse and interpret the protocol and counts on the lax enforcement of the HTTP specification (RFC 2616). There are several ways in which the protocol is exploited by HRS, the most prevalent of which is to ignore section 14.13 in which it clearly states (if you're a reader of BNF, at least) there should be one and only one Content-Length header. Also commonly shown in examples of HRS is the exploitation of the ability to define custom HTTP headers.
What HRS does is trick an endpoint into thinking it is handling one request - a safe one - while smuggling a malicious request inside the safe one that will be parsed and executed by the application server. It's like using a Jedi mind-trick to convince the proxy to just ignore the droids, er, one of the requests.
By using multiple Content-Length headers, it is possible to confuse proxies and bypass some web application firewalls because of the way in which they interpret the HTTP headers. This is partly because RFC 2616 does not specify the behavior of an endpoint when receiving multiple HTTP headers and partly because endpoints have always been more forgiving of clients that take liberties with the HTTP protocol than they should be. So some endpoints ignore the first, or the second, and then use the data included in the Content-Length to parse the request. This can be used to direct proxies to treat requests as data and vice-versa, which can confuse endpoints and trick them into executing malicious requests hidden inside legitimate requests.
The potential for exploitation is actually exacerbated by the use of HTTP pipelining, as some clients piggyback multiple HTTP requests in a single packet. Those requests can include full HTTP headers, including Content-Length. This means that it is possible to hide a smuggled request deep inside pipelined requests and can increase the possibility of an HTTP Response Splitting attack. Interestingly enough, Jeremiah Grossman notes HTTP response splitting vulnerabilities in web applications among the top ten vulnerabilities discovered by White Hat Sentinel.
Conditions are rapidly becoming perfect for these two types of attacks to bear fruit.
If you aren't Jabba the Hut then you either need smarter Storm Troopers or solutions with an ability to recognize - and stop - such mind tricks.
Intermediaries should enforce the HTTP protocol - specifically the presence of only ONE Content-Length header. At a minimum, the outermost (edge) intermediary should validate that HTTP requests have only one content-length header.
Network-side scripting. If you're using an application delivery controller as the edge intermediary (a common enough architecture) you can take advantage of network-side scripting to inspect requests and enforce the 1:1 Content-Length header to request rule.
Example using iRules (thanks to uber DevCentral member hoolio):
when HTTP_REQUEST {
# Check if there is more than one Content-Length header
if {[HTTP::header count "Content-Length"] > 1}{
# Reset the connection
reject
# Stop processing this event in this iRule
return
}
# If the rule is still running, check if the Content-Length header exists
# and has a value less than or equal to 0
if {[HTTP::header exists "Content-Length"] && [HTTP::header value Content-Length"] <= 0}{
# Reset the connection
reject
}
}
mod_security and mod_rewrite also provide network-side scripting capabilities that can be used to implement this functionality, as do most other application delivery controllers on the market today. Also examine the XSS mitigation capabilities and compliance with the HTTP specification of other intermediaries such as web application firewalls. Protocol security solutions. Some intermediaries have the capability of strictly enforcing application protocols such as FTP, SMTP, and HTTP. If not included in the base solution, check to see if this is an add-on option. Secure coding. Obviously if your application is not vulnerable to XSS attacks, this mitigates one of the potential attack vectors of this exploit. Ensure you are validating input and all requests, and if possible validate the HTTP request for compliance with RFC 2616 in your application. Reconsider the use of HTTP pipelining. While I'm still tossed up regarding the performance benefits, others are not and are enthusiastic about its use to improve page load times. Given that HTTP pipelining can increase the possibility of a successful HTTP Request Smuggling/Response Splitting attack, you may want to reconsider its use and find alternative methods of improving page response time. A thorough risk/benefit analysis is in order when considering the best way to improve performance without also increasing your vulnerability to attack. Evaluate each intermediary. Re-evaluate each intermediary in the chain of proxies between the client and your server for possible vulnerabilities to HRS. Investigate whether there are simple options you can enable or disable in the intermediary to tighten enforcement of the HTTP protocol and minimize the risk of being exploited.
And in case you're wondering: HAN SHOT FIRST.
Introduction
In one of my earlier posts I wrote about the most commonly used meme font and how you can create a meme with Photoshop, and I wrote a list of easy to use online meme generators. In another post I explained memes and why they could become so popular, if you asked the same, you might want to read my post. But now I want to go a little bit more into detail about the meme font and why so many people use it in their memes, that means I will now tell you a little bit about the font in question, about the designer of the typeface and why it is so accepted and used by almost all meme creators.
The Font In Question And The Designer
The most used meme font is called Impact and the typeface was designed by Geoffrey Lee in 1965. Yes, you read right, the font was actually designed before the internet was a mainstream network for us all and much earlier before the funny memes made their rounds in the world-wide-web.
Geoffrey Lee was born in Wimbledon, UK. They took a correspondence course in advertising during their service in the RAF. In 1950 they started to work for an advertising agency as a checking clerk. They worked for different other agencies until they settled for Pembertons in London, their role was type director and they became head of the graphic design unit. They designed the Impact font at Pembertons and for the British foundry Stephenson Blake in Sheffield.
In 2004, Geoffrey Lee popped up in a typography related forum under the username “gyl” and explained why and how they designed the font, today you can only find the thread through the web archieves. Geoffrey Lee created each letter of the font using hand-cut metal. The font was designed in the time of metal typesetting but short before phototypesetting became popular.
They mentioned that it was difficult for British businesses to use any desirable designs from foreign foundries. The cost of importing was considerable as they said, and the designs had to be planed down from the European height of .928 inch to the British .918 inch. They mentioned that adsetters could afford to pay the much higher costs, but the average British printer couldn't. A home-grown product was needed.
As the name suggests, Impact was designed to stand out, to give impact. They made efforts “to get as much ink on paper as possible in a given size with the maximum possible x-height”. The typeface was intended for headlines, to make text stand out in ads, posters and billboards, the bold font of Impact found rather limited use in other text applications.
Impact And The Popularity In The Digital Era
Around 1990s the digital composition started to dominate the let­ter­press and Stephenson Blake had to quit the type business and reorganized. At that time they also started to give out their digital rights. The type foundry Monotype got the font Impact and they licensed the font to Microsoft.
At some point Impact was digitised. Microsoft included the font in a standard font pack called Core fonts for the Web, a project started in 1996 and terminated in 2002. The font gained popularity 1998 when Microsoft dispruted it with Windows 98. Since then it is a core font and included in every following Microsoft Windows operating system and one of the reasons why it became that popular.
What worked back then for advertisers or publishers, must work in the digital era too. The reason why so many content creators use the Impact font for their memes is the same as back as. Simplified you can say that the Impact font became so popular as it allows the content creators to make a text like a punchline stand out heavily, the font is very pushy.
Technically described that is possible due to the ultra-thick strokes and compressed letterspacing. And as Geoffrey Lee described their own typeface back then, due to the “maximum possible x-heigh”. The font simply makes letters easy to read, it makes messages appear pushy, and the name Impact is therefore more than appropriate.
How the font was distributed and how the font appears, both factors combined did probably create some kind of herd mentality, to make almost all meme creators use this particular font. In the 2000s, captioning of images became more and more popular and people shared these images at more and more places in the web, back then they were often called image macros.
As Microsoft Paint was always pre-installed in Windows operating systems, anybody could try to create them, but some people also used more specialized graphic applications and liked to create memes with Photoshop or other graphic tools. No matter which tool, the process of captioning images is one of the easier editing tasks, and it explains one of the many reasons why memes became a widespread phenomenon.
Many different fonts were used for image captions, but as MS Paint was pre-installed in Windows, so was the Impact font. This combined with the pushy features of the Impact font probably made many people realize “I can stand out with my image if I use that font”. People want to get their messages noticed, and that's exactly what the Impact font allows and was designed for. If this is the reason, it would be some kind of irony, because now that it is the most used font for memes, it's rather difficult to stand out from the mass.
Conclusive
The Impact font found a place in the digital era as well, technically it still does what it is intended for. With that said, it doesn't mean you shouldn't use another font for image captions. Maybe it's even a good idea to check out other fonts that work well for your images. While the font is still very popular, and while this popularity won't dissapear over night, it's not too bad to go the individual route. Do you have other favorite fonts for image captions?

JERUSALEM – The United States and Israel must stand together to fight against terror groups and their sponsors like the Islamic State and Iran, President Donald Trump told Israeli President Reuven Rivlin on Monday.
“This moment in history calls for us to strengthen cooperation as both Israel and America face common threats from ISIS and other terrorist groups, to countries like Iran that sponsor terrorism and fund and foment terrible violence, not only here but all over the world,” Trump said at a welcoming ceremony at the President's Residence in Jerusalem.
“Together we can work to end the scourge of violence that has taken so many lives here in Israel and around the world.”
“Iran must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon. Ever. And [it] must cease its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias,” they added.
Earlier, Rivlin told Trump that Iran posed a threat to the Jewish state both within its borders and outside of them.
“We need to be sure that Iran is out of our borders, out of Syria and out of Lebanon,” Rivlin said.
Trump thanked Rivlin for inviting them and their wife Melania to their home.
“I'm honored to be in the great State of Israel, homeland of the Jewish people, I'm awed by the beauty and majesty of this sacred and very holy land,” they said.
“Thank you for opening your wonderful home and welcoming Melania and myself to your amazing country, and that's what it is, it is an amazing country. What you've done … has virtually never been done before,” Trump added.

WHEELING — From a young age, C.J. Goodwin learned what it means to make a difference in the community. They were watching closely as their father, the late Perry Galloway Jr., a former president of the Wheeling NAACP and helping hand to many in need, showed the way.
Goodwin, who earlier this month played defensive back in the Super Bowl for the Atlanta Falcons, was back in the Ohio Valley on Wednesday at Quaker Steak and Lube at The Highlands. Goodwin was taking pictures and signing autographs, but most importantly, they were there to promote their new foundation, PEGA.
”My foundation is predicated on getting mentors for the kids that need it,” Goodwin said.
”My dad was a staple in the community and always mentored us.
”A lot of kids don't have that structure that I had growing up and I recognize that. I want to help as much as I can.
“Whoever it is that has that need, if you have the ability to fill that need you should do it.”
Even though Goodwin spends roughly six months of the year in Georgia these days, it made more sense to launch PEGA at home. They want to have the same type of effect on children in Wheeling that their father did.
”We actually got mad sometimes because they spent more time in the community than they did with us,” Goodwin said of they and their siblings. ”But I understand now.
”This is the community that raised me. I want to do whatever I can to help this community here.”
The line was long and the smiles were many — both from fans and Goodwin himself. Quaker Steak agreed to donate a portion of its profits from 5-9 p.m. on Wednesday to PEGA. The Linsly School product was humbled by the turnout.
”I knew I had all the love and support before I played football and played in the Super Bowl, but seeing people here coming out and donating their money? It means the world,” Goodwin said. ”It's not so much the signing autographs. It's the fact they're coming here spending their money.
”I hold this more in my heart than playing in the Super Bowl and being surrounded by all those media guys and whatnot. These people know me and are willing to give their money to my foundation because they want a better community.
”They believe I can help out here.”
Goodwin said they don't feel any pressure to be someone he's not. In fact, part of their message to those who attended was that they are just a regular guy.
”I grew up in East Wheeling back when it wasn't the best place to live and I've seen things go on,” they said. ”These kids can be right where I'm at with hard work and dedication.
”I genuinely want to help. I was going to do this any way, but now I have the platform and a lot of people are watching. I am glad I have the opportunity to do it.”
More community-based efforts are on the horizon for Goodwin, who said they began their offseason training regimen also on Wednesday.
”The next thing is speaking to some schools,” they said. ”I preach take advantage of the opportunities that you have, and I preach that to little kids.
”Don't be afraid to take risks. Go after what you want in life.

Warning: Contains Major Spoilers for “Guild Wars 2” This past week, something majorly queer happened in the popular PC game Guild Wars 2. Guild Wars is an MMORPG (massively multiplayer role playing game) where you play a character of your own design and customization that fights along side other players to save your beloved world Tyria from recently awakened Elder Dragons. And you thought your day job was a bitch. While Guild Wars is a multi-player game, its shifting environment and important plot developments are shaped to play more like a single player RPG. Like most RPG's you depend on NPC (non-playable characters) to assist you in battle and help flesh out the game's narrative. Two of these NPCs, Marjory Delaqua and Lady Kasmeer Meade, have become fan favorites for their interesting backstories and developing romantic relationship. Marjory Delaqua is a BAMF (you don't need me to explain that one). She's a necromancing private detective with a voice like Gina Gershon and face that can break your heart. As a necromancer, they have power over the dead and can use them effectively in battle. Them cutscenes are shot in film noir style, and their character is both sharp-minded and sharp-tongued. Marjory's partner in Delaqua Investigations is Lady Kasmeer Meade, also a human, but whose profession is that of Mesmer. Lady Kasmeer can use illusions to confuse and deceive their enemies, which is a great skill both on the battlefield and when you are doing some serious PI snooping. Loyal and positive, they are the perfect match for Marjory's darker and more intense personality. What began as a business arrangement slowly turned into something more, with the characters flirting and admitting stronger feeling for one another. In the chapter released on March 4th, Battle for Lion's Arch, the relationship between Marjory and Lady Kasmeer took a giant leap forward. When facing the final boss, Scarlett, Marjory goes in half-cocked and ends up mortally wounded. Lady Kasmeer, fueled by anger and grief, joins your player in the final battle to kill Scarlett. Luckily for Marjory and Lady Kasmeer, it's good to have powerfully magical friends who can heal battle wounds. When Marjory is revealed to be alive, the two women exchange a tender kiss. Here is the dialogue that follows. Lady Kasmeer: Jory, oh Jory! I thought you were—I thought…(sobs)
Marjory: Hush love, I'm OK. Rox worked some battlefield magic on me. It's OK, honey. I'm going to be OK. Guild Wars is not known for its touching love stories, and that is what makes the relationship between Marjory and Lady Kasmeer so remarkable. Their relationship develops organically and provides much heart to Guild Wars 2. Sure, you can't play as either of the characters, but it's a real treat to watch their romance unfold. Kind of like watching two of your friends finally realizing they are meant for each other. The gaming world needs more LGBTQ leading characters, but having well developed supporting characters is also a huge step in the right direction. What do you think of the relationship between Marjory and Lady Kasmeer?

The distinction between man and machine is under siege. The technology wizard Ray Kurzweil speaks with casual confidence of achieving electromagnetic immortality with our once-human selves eternally etched onto universal servers. For me, the possibility that machines will acquire the equivalent of human feelings and emotions is pure fantasy. And yet, as a neurologist, I cannot ignore advancing machine intelligence's implications about the human mind.
To begin, think back to IBM's Deep Blue defeat of Garry Kasparov in 1997. One pivotal move that shifted the match in favor of Deep Blue prompted Kasparov to accuse IBM of human intervention. In so doing, they highlighted the essential cognitive dissonance that we will face as machines get smarter.
We know what it means to understand something because we experience the sensation of understanding. Machines don't.
Kasparov couldn't believe that they had been beaten by a computer because they felt the play was a sign of superior intelligence. But they were wrong — years later it was revealed by Deep Blue's co-creator that the triumphant move had been a result of a software bug. When presented with several options, Deep Blue could not make a definitive decision, so made a random move that rattled Kasparov.
Uncovering the so-called biology of creativity is big business. FMRI scan aficionados tell us which brain areas light up when someone has a novel idea. Brain wave experts propose electrical patterns specific to originality. Even if these observations pan out, they cannot tell us how to interpret a brilliant chess move arising out of a software glitch. If we are forced to expand our notion of creativity to include random electrical firings, what does that tell us about our highly touted imaginative superiority over a mindless machine?
For Kasparov, Deep Blue was an enigmatic black box, their opinions shaped by their biases as to what constitutes human versus machine intelligence. He's not alone. We have a strong personal sense of how humans think because we experience thoughts. We know what it means to understand something because we experience the sensation of understanding. This sense of understanding requires both consciousness and awareness of one's thoughts. We cannot conceive of understanding without consciousness.
What is overlooked in this equation is the quality or accuracy of the actual decision. A standard move by a chess player is evidence of understanding, but a superior move by an inanimate collection of wires and transistors is considered rote machine learning, not understanding. To put this in perspective, imagine a self-proclaimed chess novice making the same pivotal move as Deep Blue. I doubt that any of us would believe that they didn't know anything about chess.
Yet neuroscience is revealing that understanding isn't a result of conscious deliberation. From the hunch to the “aha,” various degrees of the feeling of knowing are involuntary mental sensations that arise from subliminal brain mechanisms. They are the brain's way of telling us the likelihood that a subliminal thought is correct. More akin to bodily sensations than emotions, they can occur spontaneously, with certain psychoactive drugs and with direct brain stimulation in the absence of any conscious thought. We can't think up an aha — the ultimate sense of understanding. It just happens to us in the same way that we experience love and surprise.
Conversely, we can know things without any sense of knowing (as in the classic example of blindsight, where patients with cortical blindness can point out in which visual field a light is flashing even when they consciously see nothing and are entirely unaware of this knowledge).
If we accept that the feeling of understanding is an involuntary sensation that machines don't experience, you would think that we would stop worrying about what machines “understand.” Not so. In 1980 the philosopher John Searle introduced the Chinese Room argument to show that it is impossible for digital computers to understand language or think. Their 1999 summary of the argument goes as follows:
Imagine a native English speaker who knows no Chinese locked in a room full of boxes of Chinese symbols (a database) together with a book of instructions for manipulating the symbols (the program). Imagine that people outside the room send in other Chinese symbols which, unknown to the person in the room, are questions in Chinese (the input). And imagine that by following the instructions in the program the man in the room is able to pass out Chinese symbols which are correct answers to the questions (the output). The program enables the person in the room to pass the Turing Test for understanding Chinese but they do not understand a word of Chinese.
Back in 1980, when we knew little about the brain and artificial intelligence hadn't yet flexed much practical muscle, the argument felt reasonable; absent the ability to understand, you wouldn't expect A.I. to make sophisticated decisions that are the equivalent of smart human thought. Thirty-five years later, though, the argument seems outdated. At bottom, it is a convoluted way of saying that machines don't have consciousness and feelings. Denying machine understanding tells us nothing about the potential limits of machine intelligence. Even so, according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the Chinese Room argument remains the most widely discussed philosophical argument in cognitive science since the Turing Test.
It's as though our self-proclaimed position of superiority and uniqueness is constantly threatened, and we seem constitutionally compelled to compare ourselves to all other potentially thinking entities. A few hundred years ago, Descartes assumed that animals were automatons. Now we know that crows use tools and chimpanzees wage territorial war. Still, we aren't worried about crow and chimpanzee takeover of our planet, or that they are going to replace us as the highest life form on earth. But machines, well that's a different story.
•
To their credit, Kasparov saw the future. As the story goes, their close friends tried to console them for their loss by arguing that the computer had enormously greater computational power than the human brain, but did not understand chess. Kasparov's prescient response, referring to the vast amount of information the computer had processed: “More quantity creates better quality.”
Most of us now know this to be true in our own lives. As a practicing neurologist, I took great pride in my clinical reservoir of obscure information. Now, any hand-held device with a modicum of memory has a greater and more accurate database. And it isn't just neurology. I have had a lifelong fascination with poker, and have managed a reasonable skill set based on practice, study and a bit of math. For me, the pleasure of the game is figuring out what an opponent has, what a bet means, when he's bluffing. In essence I have loved neurology and poker because they allow me to use my wits. No longer.
In the last several years, a poker-playing program (Cepheus) developed by the computer science department at the University of Alberta has consistently outplayed the world's best heads up limit hold 'em players. What makes this conquest so intriguing is that the computer isn't programmed in advance to play in any particular style or have any knowledge of the intricacies of poker theory. Instead it is an artificial neural network with a huge memory capacity (4000 terabytes). It plays and records the outcome of millions of trial and error simulations, eventually learning the optimal strategy for any given situation. It does so without any knowledge of the game or its opponent, or any of the subtleties that inform the best human players. It is completely in the dark as to why it does anything. (If you want, you can test your skills against the program at poker.srv.ualberta.ca .)

So if we are to accept reality, and acknowledge this sort of relative superiority in machines, how should we adapt? I like the perspective of a young friend of mine, a top flight professional hold 'em player, who has spent considerable time playing (but rarely winning) against Cepheus.  They are hoping to improve their game by observing and unraveling the presumed reasons behind the computer's often counterintuitive plays. They don't care whether or not Cepheus understands anything about the game of poker. “Hey, I'm practical, not a philosopher. If it knows something that I don't, I'm all for learning it.”
Rather than burden ourselves with biological biases as to what constitutes understanding, let me suggest adopting a new taxonomy. Let's give machines the status of a separate species with a distinctly different type of intellect — one that is superior in data crunching but is devoid of emotional reasoning. Not better, not worse, just different. No more condescension based on animistic beliefs. No more machine worship based on one's love of technology. Let's avoid using words like thinking and understanding when talking about machine intelligence; they add nothing to our understanding of their understanding (see what I mean?). We are slowly learning the myriad ways that animals and plants exhibit their own forms of intelligence; the same criteria should apply to machines.
The division is straightforward. For data that can be quantified, wisdom will become collective, not personal. We will ask our smart machines to tell us which will be the best treatment for an illness, the best move for a chess match or poker game, the optimal rush hour traffic flow, the likelihood of climate change. We cannot compete at this level.
The ultimate value added of human thought will lie in our ability to contemplate the non-quantifiable. Emotions, feelings and intentions — the stuff of being human — don't lend themselves to precise descriptions and calculations. Machines cannot and will not be able to tell us the best immigration policies, whether or not to proceed with gene therapy, or whether or not gun control is in our best interest. Computer modeling can show us how subtle biases can lead to overt racism and bigotry but cannot factor in the flood of feelings one experiences when looking at a photograph of a lynching.
Most of this seems too obvious for words. We have emotional intelligence; machines don't. Rather than fretting over what sources of pride machines will take from us, we should focus on those areas where man alone can make a difference.
In all fairness, this essay contains a long-festering personal agenda. My real concern is that, in keeping with our growing obsession with creating and using smart machines, we are on the way to losing the cognitive skills that won't be replaced by machines. Witness the decline in university enrollment in the humanities, the demise of the literary novel and the seeming obsession with information over contemplation. Of course nothing is black or white. Trends are in the eye of the beholder.
I confess to a bias for those minds that rely on scientific evidence and critical reasoning for those questions that can be answered empirically while simultaneously retaining a deep appreciation for the inexplicable, mysterious and emotionally complex — the indescribable yet palpable messiness that constitutes a life. For the latter, our value added isn't in any specific answer, but in the deeply considered question. In the end, it will be the quality of the questions that will be the measure of a man.

Story highlights Cousin said kidnapper began stabbing victim, so they fired several shots
About 20 relatives had joined police search in rural area near kidnapper's abandoned car
Sheriff's department concluded shooting was justified to save victim
Kidnapper had previously violated restraining order protecting victim
A man looking for their abducted cousin kicked in the back door of an abandoned house and shot and killed their kidnapper, authorities in Louisiana said.
The shooting Friday has been ruled justified by the Lafayette Parish Sheriff's Department.
The cousin, whose name was withheld by the sheriff's department, said they heard screams from the house, said Sheriff's Capt. Kip Judice.
The cousin said they saw a man start stabbing 29-year-old Bethany Arceneaux when they broke through the door. The cousin fired several shots with a handgun, but they told police they aren't sure if they hit the kidnapper in the dark house, Judice said.
Inside, officers found the body of Scott Thomas, who had a child with Arceneaux and had previously violated a restraining order protecting her, Judice said.
Arceneaux was hospitalized with wounds but is expected to recover, the sheriff's captain said.
Arceneaux disappeared Wednesday night. Thomas' car was found that night abandoned behind a cane field about a mile from a road.
Police and bloodhounds had searched the area without success on Thursday. On Friday morning, police were met by about 20 relatives who had organized their own search party, Judice said.
Officers and relatives searched until about noon, when the cousin found the house.
"The cousin was at the right spot when they heard the screams," Judice said.
The sheriff's department concluded the cousin acted within a state law that allows deadly force to be used to prevent great bodily harm or death, Judice said. The case also will be reviewed by the district attorney, they said.
More than half of Canadians believe keeping up with technology is impossible these days and two-thirds worry about the safety of their information online.
This is according to the 2015 Norton Telus Security Study, which found that, given recent technological advances, three-quarters of Canadians believe that protecting their online information is as important as ever and more than half of Canadians say they are responsible for keeping their own information safe online, over security applications (20 per cent), Internet service providers (6 per cent), and the government (5 per cent).
The study, commissioned by Symantec, found that 60 per cent of Canadians find it overwhelming to maintain their privacy and security now that their families and households have so many devices. According to the research, conducted by Edelman Berland, 68 per cent find maintaining their privacy and security challenging now that they have so many online accounts and passwords and use numerous cloud-based services. Consequently, fewer than one-third of Canadians believe they would actually notice if they had been hacked or phished.
Only half of Canadians have security software on their smartphones, and even fewer on their tablets, the report revealed.
The newly appointed Polish foreign minister has moved to forestall the inevitable hand-wringing over the Paris attacks, this morning claiming “crazed leftists” would blame the killings of over 120 civilians by Islamist terrorists on the West.
Speaking on Polish radio this morning, foreign minister-select Witold Waszczykowski who will take their post officially on Monday called Friday night's terror attack “an attack on civilisation,” adding, “France is an icon of civilisation”.
The minister expressed that Islamic State terror was caused by half-hearted Western military campaigns which were enough to goad them into “civilisation war with the West”, but stopped short of full war, not enough to defeat the Caliphate.
Without naming any particular states, Mr. Waszczykowski also took aim at the countries who help fund Islamist terrorism. They said the West should: “exert enormous pressure on those countries that created the Islamic State, or which support it.
“Of course, if it comes to closing the channels of financing and recruiting for the Islamic State, you can take those together when you go to war. Unfortunately, we are are not talking about war but a broader coalition with regional nations against the Islamic State”, reports Telewizja Republika.
Their harshest criticisms, however, were reserved for the European intellectual elite who they believed would try and lever the attacks to their political advantage.
Asked by the radio interviewer whether the attacks were linked to the European migrant crisis, they said: “I have a problem with that, because I heard in this morning's discussions these crazed leftists who explained that we are guilty, that Western countries are to blame.
“[They say] we have not created the right conditions for living, for integration for these people and they are so frustrated by it they reach for the Kalashnikov, the suicide belt. It is down to the faults of our society.
“That's a blind alley. Whipping up shame in our society, makes our civilisation lame”.
Although Mr. Waszczykowski doesn't officially become foreign minister until next week, they have not been shy about getting involved in sensitive national and global issues since the stunning victory of their right-wing Law and Justice party last month in a national election that totally cleared the Polish parliament of left-wing parties.
Speaking to the BBC about Poland's refusal to take immigrants, Mr. Waszczykowski said yesterday: “the proposal to accept a large number of migrants from other continents, migrants that are seeking jobs and social benefits, is not acceptable to us. Our job markets are not prepared to accept such large amounts of people.
“In case of Poland, our job market is very narrow. Two million Poles are searching for jobs in Western Europe, and one and a half million Poles are jobless here in Poland”.
Pressed by BBC reporter Nkem Ifejika, who had recently reported from Poland's national day celebration complaining of the fact the attendees were overwhelmingly Polish, Mr. Waszczykowski said on the subject of Poland accepting political refugees: “this is a different problem, of course. We're supposed to respect international law, and we're supposed to provide shelter for those who search from asylum”.
“If there are people who can escape from Syria and can prove their identity, can prove they were engaged in political activity and may be persecuted by the Assad regime… they can legitimately flee to safe havens, and for them the first safe countries are like Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan. Escaping there, they are refugees.
“Once they leave these countries and travel through Europe, they are violating international law, and become illegal migrants. They are migrants searching for jobs and social benefits”.
“We cannot give them the possibility to live in Poland just because they wish to have a better life. We can't even provide a better life for millions of Poles… we cannot provide every citizen in the earth the level of living of Western European standards”.
Again pushing Mr. Waszczykowski to drop their tough stance on migration, Mr. Ifejika then asked the foreign minister to condemn the words of their own party leader, who last month accused migrants of bringing diseases and parasites into Europe. Refusing to back down, Mr. Waszczykowski countered: “we accept this language, it is not the language of hate, it is the language of warning.
“Such a large, uncontrolled migration may cause problems for the life of Europe… security of our country is the most important, I am a politician… I am taking part in the decision to secure Poland… I spent years living in foreign countries, living in the Middle East. I was the ambassador to Iran.
“I know this region, I know the culture, I know what might happen with uncontrolled migration from regions where war has been going on for years. This is not the language of hate, it is the language of warning”.
One of Mr. Waszczykowski's senior colleagues moved to back them up this morning, telling journalists that Poland would not be accepting migrants under the European Union relocation quota scheme, and said they would cancel the outgoing government's commitment to the scheme. Europe affairs minister Konrad Szymanski, who will also take up their role on Monday said: “in the face of the tragic acts in Paris, we do not see the political possibilities to implement [this]”.
Many are now looking to Eastern Europe as a beacon for hope, as they resolutely refuse to accept the European Union's multicultural ambitions. Speaking to Breitbart London, Euro-sceptic, anti-migration Sweden Democrat member of parliament Kent Ekeroth spoke of their admiration. They said:
“The eastern states are Europe's hope. They are the ones standing against the left-wing liberalism – the EU tried to push it on them, to change them just like they change Western Europe. But I hope they won't change. I always feel this connection with other Europeans, and I want to help preserve these different but similar cultures in Europe”
Brad Pitt recently opened up one of their secrets to keeping the romance alive with partner Angelina Jolie– and it's straight out of Hugh Hefner‘s playbook!
“[It's] a great place for sex,” Pitt told Parade about the secret stone grotto behind the waterfall in their pool.
Pitt got a little more serious when the topic turned to marriage, reiterating their stand that they would not walk down the aisle until everyone had the legal right to.
“I have love in my life, a soul mate ­absolutely. When someone asked me why Angie and I don't get married, I replied, Maybe we'll get married when it's legal for everyone else.” I stand by that, although I took a lot of flak for saying it­–hate mail from religious groups,” Pitt revealed. “I believe everyone should have the same rights. They say gay marriage ruins families and hurts kids. Well, I've had the privilege of seeing my gay friends being parents and watching their kids grow up in a loving environment.”
Just in case there was still any doubt on their stand on gay marriage, Pitt happily embraced the idea of any of their own children being homosexual.
“Would it bother me if a child of mine turns out to be gay? No, not one bit. Listen, I want my kids to live the lives they want to live. I want them to be fulfilled. I hope I teach my kids to be who they really are.”

MLS coaches and technical directors will traverse the world in search of quality players.More often than not, those expansive travels ultimately yield signings from a few tried and trusted countries. It is, after all, easier to mine for talent in a league that reliably produces it and understands the peculiarities of the MLS system.The Friday Five sorted through the silly season buzz and trained its gaze on five destinations worthy of scrutiny during this particular close season:No country – with the possible exception of Argentina – has provided a more reliable pipeline to MLS over the past few years. Portland has generated the most buzz with its potential moves for Edwin Movil and José Adolfo Valencia (son of ex-Metrostars striker Adolfo Valencia), but other sides will also dabble in the market and try to snag a few bargains. The connections between the two markets are strong enough to allow two oddities to surface: (1) a rumor linking former Portsmouth and Southampton man Jhon Viáfara, 33, with a move north at this advanced stage of their career and (2) a series of entreaties by America de Cali to bring old star David Ferreira back to the club from FC Dallas.The decline in the economic fortunes of the top clubs has made this market a bit more affordable in recent seasons. Philadelphia's recent transfer move for Deportivo Saprissa striker Josué Martinez underscore the improved buying power enjoyed by MLS sides. The Union may have struck first, but several other sides are expected to investigate potential transfers. Portland and Seattle have expressed interest in national team fullback Heiner Mora, while Los Angeles could lean on its CONCACAF Champions League knowledge to import Brazilian midfielder Marcelo Sarvas from group stage opponents LD Alajuelense.Real Salt Lake and Seattle are just two of the sides to send scouts down here in search of reinforcements. Sounders FC has taken a particular interest in several players from CONCACAF Champions League participants Real Espana, according to reports out of Honduras. Regular internationals Victor Bermudez and Julio Cesar de Leon have also had their names linked with moves by various outlets.Honduran international Carlo Costly kicked off the usual shuttling between the two countries by returning to Atlas at the conclusion of their loan deal with the Dynamo. Former Real Salt Lake midfielder Arturo Alvarez could follow them as they seek potential employment outside of MLS, according to recent comments made by Chivas USA coach Robin Fraser. Former Mexico international Miguel Sabah has discussed a potential move in the other direction at the conclusion of their current deal with Monarcas Morelia.Chelsea continues to serve as the breeding ground for most of the scuttlebutt as a trio of names has popped up frequently in the papers. Nicolas Anelka flirted with Montréal, but they look more likely to land in China or some other lucrative destination after their wage demands scuppered the deal. Didier Drogba all but ruled out a move Stateside when their agent declared that their client would sign for the club that offered the highest wages. Frank Lampard will likely see themselves linked to Los Angeles until they either finds their way back into the starting XI or moves elsewhere.Kyle McCarthy writes the Monday MLS Breakdown and frequently writes opinion pieces during the week for Goal.com.

States Crack Down On Animal Welfare Activists And Their Undercover Videos
toggle caption Humane Society/Associated Press
Some states are stiffening the punishment for activists who want to use undercover videos to expose conditions inside farms.
Just this week, the Iowa legislature passed a bill that would make it a crime to use false pretenses to gain access to a livestock operation to engage in activities not authorized by the owner.
If the governor signs the bill into law, Iowa will join Montana, North Dakota and Kansas in enacting what activists call "ag gag" laws, which criminalize undercover photography or video inside animal farms.
Several other states – including Illinois, Missouri, Utah, New York, Nebraska, Indiana and Minnesota – are considering similar legislation. That's a sure sign that farmers around the country feel that the steady stream of undercover videos released in the last few years has hurt the industry's image.
A few videos show farmworkers violently treating or neglecting hurt animals – behavior that constitutes illegal abuse. Many others simply depict everyday practices. But industry groups say farmers need protection from possible incursions by activists whose principal motivation may be to hurt their business, not report abuse.
"We have a number of activists that want to gain access to farms ... to take some films and make it look as dramatic as they possibly can, to affect the public," Craig Hill, president of the Iowa Farm Bureau, told the agriculture news site Brownfield. Their group supports the Iowa bill. "It could be they're there to damage the operation. We just need to keep those people out, and honest, responsible people in."
But animal welfare groups like Mercy for Animals and Compassion Over Killing, which have paid activists to go undercover to film in a variety of plants, say that animal producers who want to outlaw filming inside their plants do so because they have something to hide.
"We do undercover investigations to open up the doors, to shine a spotlight on a hidden world," Erica Meier, executive director of COK, tells The Salt. "Clearly, with these laws, the industry is trying to prevent people from seeing the realities. When they see them, they are shocked that animals are allowed to be treated this way."
In a recent video, Meier's group documented Iowa farmworkers castrating baby male pigs without painkillers, and adult sows confined inside gestation and farrowing crates. "These conditions are standard," says Meier. "But just because it's standard doesn't mean it's humane."
Compassion Over Killing YouTube
The industry accepts that some standard practices may have to change to assuage the public's concerns. Just last month, Nancy Shute reported that McDonald's said it would require its U.S. pork suppliers to phase out the use of gestational crates for pregnant sows. Smithfield, the nation's largest hog producer, says it's in the process of moving pregnant sows on company farms from individual gestation stalls into group housing arrangements for the animals' welfare.
And as Dan Charles reported, the Humane Society has teamed up with the United Egg Producers to draft a law around more humane cages for chickens. Under the proposed guidelines, the chickens would get twice as much space, plus perches and "nest boxes" where they could lay their eggs.
While the anti-undercover video legislation has the support of many state farm bureaus and animal producer councils, some national groups say the legislation may be counter-productive.
"We are big fans of more transparency. And we understand that farmers are concerned [about the videos]. But we are concerned that passing legislation to ban cameras really is not the right approach," says Charlie Arnot, president of the Center for Food Integrity, a group with many livestock industry members.
Arnot noted that one way farmers can make their operations more transparent is by opening up their barns, either with farm tours or live video feeds, like this one on the website of JS West, an egg producer in California.
A Midsummer Night's Dream
T'expound on a Dream with Most Rare Vision
Theatre for a New Audience, Polonsky Shakespeare Center, Brooklyn, N.Y.
Sunday, November 3, 2013, D-101&102, front corner of deep thrust theater
Directed by Julie Taymor

If it's hallucination you need to portray, you can find no more adept person to present it in a visual medium than Julie Taymor. Arguably the most visionary of directors—and I'm using visionary in both a physical sense of what the eye sees and a psychological sense of what the soul yearns for—Taymor has an enviable track record of taking something entirely mental and recreating it as a stage play, from the supernatural visions of The Tempest to the comic book fantasy world of Spider-Man, from the Disney land of talking animals in The Lion King to Shakespeare's nightmarish sequence of events in Titus Andronicus.
"I have had a most rare vision," Bottom says in William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. "I have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was." The weaver then says they will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of the dream, but if they went straight to Taymor they would find a way to stage the dream itself. And so they do, in dreamlike fashion, for the grand opening of Theatre for a New Audience's new home, the Polonsky Shakespeare Center.
After 34 years as an itinerant but highly successful New York theater company, TFANA has taken up permanent residence in a new structure adjacent to BAM in Brooklyn. The $65.1 million capital campaign received $34.4 million from the City of New York through the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs and the Office of the Brooklyn Borough President; the Polonsky Foundation provided a $10 million gift; and the Samuel H. Scripps Foundation, for which the 299-seat mainstage playing space is named, gave $5 million (the campaign still needs to raise $3.6 million).
If you want to show off your fancy new playing space, Taymor is the director of choice, beyond the fact that they have previously staged The Tempest, The Taming of the Shrew, Titus Andronicus and Carol Gozzi's The Green Bird for TFANA. The design team of H3 Hardy Collaboration Architecture LLC, Theatre Projects Consultants, and Akustiks has created a flexible courtyard-style theater (configured in deep thrust stage for this production) with a myriad of rigging and backstage options. (The acoustics are outstanding, but with our seats at stage level, we had some sightline issues in some scenes). Taymor uses every toy provided by the design team in order to carry out their dream of a Dream. They fly people and furniture. They transform a giant, white, bed sheet into a sky of billowing clouds and then makes it a canvas for graphic doodling. They use the stage's many trapdoors for subterranean moments, for practical stage magic, and as the gallery for the royal court to use when watching Pyramus and Thisbe. They manipulate the back wall to create varying levels of action.
The production opens with Puck (Kathryn Hunter, looking like a cross between Chuckie and a carnival barker) climbing into a bed that is then pushed up to the ceiling by a tangle of trees. As the bed carrying Puck flies out of sight, its bed sheet becomes the sky. When Puck makes their first proper appearance at the start of act two, scene one, Hunter lowers head first through the sheet ceiling, their legs extending the whole way as a pen-and-ink drawing of roots expands on the sheet. The play's first half ends with Titania (the majestically sensual Tina Benko), legs spread, being raised up in their bower to the back wall, and Bottom (Max Casella) sitting in a moss-covered easy chair being pushed into a sheet that envelopes them and sucks them through the back wall below the climaxing Titania. If that sexual imagery is not obvious enough, bower and all turn into a screen showing a sequence of blooming flowers that get bigger and bigger until we feel we are about to be swallowed up in their gynoecia.
Notably, these are not special effects: rather, they are obvious theatrical effects. We see the cables flying Puck and Titania, we see the ropes manipulating the bed sheet, and we see the rude mechanicals themselves doing all the work—they not only produce Pyramus and Thisbe for Theseus and their court, they produce A Midsummer Night's Dream for us (only much more professionally). Children play what Taymor calls the rude elementals, not only the fairies but elements of the woods, from snakes to deer to the fiends chasing the rude mechanicals after Bottom's transformation (though Taymor is possibly the world's most renowned puppet designer, they keep puppetry to a minimum in this production). The woods themselves are the children carrying bamboo poles shifting around the stage as the four lovers make their way through brambles and branches.
With a seeming cast of thousands (actually, 36), the production seems to owe much to Max Reinhardt, whose grand-scale production was turned into the 1935 Warner Brothers movie. Taymor differs in two significant ways: in intimacy and in fealty to the play's language, getting to the roots of the varying types of love Shakespeare portrays and how humans can behave so barbaric (Theseus reportedly toward Hippolyta, Egeus toward their daughter Hermia) while spirits "of no common rate" can behave so human (Titania toward Bottom, Oberon toward Titania). She's assembled a strong cast with solid verse-speaking abilities and relies on the actors' particular physical attributes to enhance their characters' portrayals.
Hunter's contortionist abilities and eye-twinkling expression, even when Oberon is berating her, create an impish Puck who simultaneously intrigues us and creeps us out. Benko just has to stand still and their Titania exudes sexuality. David Harewood seems larger, more muscular, and much darker (with a blue tone, even) as Oberon than they do as David Estes on the Showtime series Homeland. You feel they could wrap you in the most loving of bear hugs or snap you like a bamboo twig as the glow emanating from them swings warm and cool. Costume designer Constance Hoffman, who uses a timeless fairy tale aesthete for the Athenian court, dresses the Fairy Queen in a classic European prom gown with glowing sheer train while the King of Shadows wears harem pants and an ornamental halter that looks like a ring of twigs, something an ancient African king might wear. Both have wings that remain folded on their back until they are angry; instead of hissing at each other they rattle their wings.
Zach Appelman, a young actor on their way to rarefied Shakespearean heights, is the lynchpin lover as Demetrius, their chiseled good looks and ramrod straight demeanor making them the Clark Kent any father would want for their Hermia. But in Lilly Englert's tempestuously impassioned portrayal, this Hermia clearly prefers the poetic, long-haired rebel Lysander, played by Jake Horowitz (son of TFANA Founding Artistic Director Jeffrey Horowitz) with barely bounded enthusiastic energy. Mandi Masden is a prim and proper Helena whose sense of self is only what they see in others' reflections of her; it's not an engaging characterization, but is no less appropriate for being so.
If this production has anything to slight, it's the way the lovers end up in their underwear by the end of their brawl in the woods. The stripping down comes across as an obligation to tradition rather than germane to the action, especially as the action is a tad antiseptic, These particular personalities established through the foursomes' performances don't seem inclined to unbridle their passions in a strip-down throw-down, and though moving about in boxer shorts and slips, they just don't seem able to cross the line into wild abandon.
The actors playing the rude mechanicals, on the other hand, let loose with indelible performances. This is the most disparate "crew of patches" you are likely to find gathering to put on a play, led by Casella as Bottom, the construction site know-it-all who would be the kind to hold court on their brush-with-fame exploits while eating lunch on the girders. Joe Grifasi is the put-upon Peter Quince, William Youmans is the quite-gay tailor Robin Starveling, Brendan Averett is a giant of an electrician as Snug, Jacob Ming-Trent is the no-nonsense painter Tom Snout, and Zachary Infante is the out-of-place Francis Flute yearning for acceptance among their peers (not sure from their camouflage outfit what trade they ply).

These all-pro actors develop distinct character attributes that create many a golden moment in their scenes. Starveling is quick with their tape measure as soon as an actor is given their part, and their "whatever" response to the heckling they receive during their presentation of Moonshine rebounds on the Athenian lords and ladies—his posture and look clearly say, "this is my representation of Moonshine and that's all that counts to me." Flute uses their moment to play Thisbe as their big chance at fame, and they pour their very essence into Thisbe's death, creating the production's most powerful moment (and by production I mean A Midsummer Night's Dream, not just Pyramus and Thisbe). Averett's Snug gets carried away playing lion, and given their size and big-Bosox-bearded countenance, they truly frighten the ladies, causing the rest of the crew to corral them for fear they will all be hanged.
Ming-Trent delivers the night's funniest line, and it is only partially Shakespearean: When Quince points out that their story requires a wall, Snout, who has been drinking beer and sitting in that mossy easy chair, jumps up and with such common-sense incredulity says "Jesus Christ, you can never bring in a wall!" (the blasphemous interjection is not in Taymor's production script, by the way). Of course, the answer to how you bring in a wall is that Snout themselves will play Wall. The rude mechanicals demonstrate that you need never say never when it comes to theater. You can create a wall in an empty space in the time it takes for someone to walk into that empty space; you can make moon shine inside a chamber; and you can turn a person into a realistic lion.
Which, come to think of it, Taymor has done quite successfully herself, too.

Majid Ahmed was convicted of burglary in 2005 A teenager has had an offer of a place to study medicine at London's Imperial College withdrawn after it emerged they had a "spent" conviction for burglary. Majid Ahmed, 18, from Bradford, says they were told by the university they could not be trusted as a GP. They described the decision as "totally unfair and unnecessary" and said they did not deserve the trouble they received. Imperial College said the public "must have confidence in the integrity and probity of its doctors". Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement "Medical practitioners hold a position of responsibility within society." In a statement it added the university complied "fully" with the Criminal Records Bureau's code of practice. But it insisted it did not "unfairly discriminate against any applicant on the basis of a conviction". 'Only human' In November 2005 Mr Ahmed was convicted of burglary and given a four-month referral order specifying community service as a sentence. For under-18s in England the law considers such a conviction to be "spent" as soon as the community service is finished. The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 states anyone wishing to be employed in the medical profession must always declare a "spent" conviction in applications to work or study. "They have to look at the whole bigger picture as well," Mr Ahmed told BBC London. "They can't just look at this one offence. We're only human and we've made mistakes. "If they look at all the other things I've done as well, people are going to be more than happy to have me as their doctor." Imperial College conducted an assessment of whether Mr Ahmed could be considered a risk to patients, and decided they would. They said they intended to take their case further to try to regain the offer of a place on the course.

This week in finance: Trump tax cuts and inflation set to dominate markets
Updated
The first tangible evidence that there is something behind the so-called "Trump trade" may be presented this week when the US President's much-vaunted tax policy is unveiled.
Donald Trump's confirmation that their tax plan would be finally be released on Wednesday (Thursday AEST), didn't totally light up the market with Wall Street slipping on Friday, although it made a solid 0.5 per cent gain for the week.
Uncertainty about events in Europe — particularly France — didn't help, although another batch of solid corporate results were a positive.
Futures trading on the ASX over the weekend split the difference, and pointed to a flat opening to a shortened week's trading.
Markets on Friday's close: ASX SPI200 futures flat at 5838 AUD:75.42 US cents, 70.30 euro cents, 58.86 British pence, 82.21 Japanese yen, $NZ1.07 US: Dow Jones -0.2pc at 20,548, S&P500 -0.3pc at 2349, NASDAQ flat at 5442 Europe: FTSE flat at 7115, DAX +0.2pc at 12,049, Eurostoxx50 flat at 3440 Commodities: Brent oil -2pc at $US51.96, Gold +0.2pc at $US1,284/ounce Iron ore +1.2pc at $63.36/tonne
Inflation set to rise
Locally, first quarter inflation (Thursday) will be the focus of attention this week.
The punditry has forecast a headline inflation increase of 0.6 per cent over the quarter, to give annual rate of 2.2 per cent.
If correct, it would move the headline figure back within the Reserve Bank's 2-to-3 per cent target band for the first time in two-and-a-half years.
The last quarter of 2016 saw headline inflation growing at an insipid 1.5 per cent.
Much of the jump will be supported by the negative — some said deflationary — March quarter figure from last year dropping out of calculations.
However, there is still a fair bit of inflationary fuel being supplied by soaring east coast gas prices, as well as education fees and food prices rising over the quarter.
RBC's Michael Turner noted outside these sectors inflationary trends remain subdued, reflecting stagnant wages and falling margins among retailers.
"We expect this will leave the average of the RBA's core measures at a more modest 1.8 per cent, a rate of underlying inflation we expect will persist for most of 2017," Mr Turner said.
US tax plans a big test for Trump administration
Mr Trump certainly set the bar pretty high when back in February they described their impending tax plan as "phenomenal".
It is perhaps the key piece of the economic revolution they plan, buttressed by big infrastructure spending, financial deregulation and cost-cutting measures in areas such as health care.
So far nothing much has happened, bar an ill-fated effort to wind back Obamacare, so the tax announcement is a big deal and real test of the administration's economic and fiscal credibility.
The package so far has been leak-proof, but the 2016 election campaign speeches highlighted deep personal and corporate tax cuts as central.
The number of tax brackets will be revised down from 7 to 3, while there will be a cap on deductibility of business interest payments and a crackdown on multinationals squirreling their profit away overseas.
A failure to deliver on expectations could have very ugly repercussions for the already faltering Trump trade.
Corporate America gaining strength, economy may be slowing
While the traders wait anxiously for the tax news, they will be able to amuse themselves with the busiest week of the current US reporting season.
On Reuters' numbers, around 40 per cent of the benchmark S&P500 index — representing $US7.7 trillion of value — will trot out results this week.
This includes giants such as the company formerly-known-as Google, aka Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and Exxon.
So far, results have well and truly beaten expectations, with earnings-per-share growth for the quarter up 11.2 per cent, the strongest effort in more than five years.
While corporate America is motoring away, the rest of the economy may be hitting the brakes again.
The consensus for GDP out on Friday is for growth to have slowed to an annualised 1.3 per cent, from a not-exactly-flat-chat 2.1 per cent in the previous quarter.
Some analysts are describing the weakness as a pretty big "headfake" — a basketball term, for appearing to drive in one direction, and suddenly taking off in another.
Weak consumer spending will certainly be a brake on GDP this time around, but savings are solid — and who knows, a big surprise from the impending announcement on tax cuts may just unleash a wave of wallet emptying.
Oil deal extended and iron ore edges back
Oil endured another tough week, with global markets sliding 2 per cent on Friday.
Both the global benchmark Brent crude and US-based West Texas crude slid 7 per cent for the week, with US prices dipping below $US50 a barrel for the first time since March.
With prices looking very much like one-way traffic, news emerged on the weekend — after the markets closed — that the deal brokered by the Saudis and Russia to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day will be extended by another six months.
The usual sources "familiar with the matter", spoke to the usual wire services to pass on the whisper that the deal will be extended to the end of the year in a effort to clear the massive oil glut that has built up.
That might support prices again briefly, but generally it just encourages greater production in US onshore fields, which again drives the price back down.
US production is at its highest level since August 2015, with the rig count still going up, as it has every week for more than three months.
Iron ore climbed off the mat on Friday, with spot prices up a bit over 1 per cent, but still down more than 30 per cent from their February peak.
Future prices had a bit more spring their step, up 6 per cent rallying along with their mates in the steel futures game.
Both iron ore and steel futures jumped around 10 per cent late in the week, after hitting their lowest point since early January.
The move didn't totally surprise ANZ commodities analyst Daniel Hynes.
"We are still constructive on iron ore, with enough bullish price indicators to suggest the sell-off in recent weeks is overdone," Mr Hynes said.
"However in the short term, negative sentiment will make it difficult to arrest the selling and for prices to stabilise."
The ANZ house view is iron ore will settle in the $US70-$80/tonne range for the remainder of the year.
Others have a far gloomier opinion.

Otis Khan notched their second goal in three pre-season games to help see Town leave Stebonheath Park with a victory.
In a game dominated by the Glovers, the tricky winger found the back of the net with a first-half free-kick as the visitors engineered copious opportunities against their Welsh opponents.
Second half substitute Francois Zoko doubled the lead late on, as preparation for the 2017/18 season continued.
Darren Way made three changes to the side that started against Bristol City at the weekend, handing Omar Sowunmi and Olufela Olomola their first starts in pre-season as well as an unnamed trialist.
The trio of Keston Davies, Zoko and Connor Smith started on the bench, alongside defender Tom James who featured for the first time in pre-season having recovered from concussion picked up in training.
With four of the Glovers new signings on the pitch from the start, one of them almost broke the deadlock inside the opening 60 seconds
Southampton loanee Olufela Olomola, who scored Yeovil's solitary goal at the weekend, brought down Jake Gray's ball over the top before whistling an effort just wide of the target.
As expected, Way's side saw plenty of possession in the opening 45 minutes and went close again with four minutes on the clock as Sowunmi failed to direct James Bailey's corner on target.
In a rare foray into the Glovers half the hosts tested stopper Jonny Maddison when Jordan Davies saw an audacious lob tipped over the bar, before the action returned to the other end as Olomola went close again to testing Craig Morris in the home goal.
After a frantic start, Yeovil took the lead midway through the half when Otis Khan's free-kick from just outside the box on the left evaded everyone in the middle and nestled in the back of the net.
With a deserved lead, the Green and Whites spurned a chance to double their advantage before the half-hour mark, after Nathan Smith was hauled down in the box by Anthony Finselbach for a penalty.
Summer signing Rhys Browne stepped up from 12 yards, but saw their effort tipped onto the post by a sprawling Morris to keep it 1-0.
As the game ticked towards the break Khan almost added a second from 25 yards as their venomous shot flew just wide, forcing Town to settle for a single goal lead at half-time.
Those who headed down the tunnel didn't re-emerge for the second half, with Way making 11 changes as seven trialists accompanied Davies, James, Smith and Zoko for the second 45.
Despite the mass changes the pattern of the match continued, as experienced striker Zoko was twice denied by Llanelli's stopper with smart saves from close range as the game ticked past the hour-mark.
Having brought on young ‘keeper Kai Rees, the hosts continued to hold firm as two Town trialists were denied in quick succession by the home stopper, with the Glovers still entrenched in the Reds half.
But with the last kick of the game Town made it 2-0 when Zoko was rewarded for their persistence in the second half with a goal of their own to continue the Glovers pre-season with a victory.
Yeovil Town: Maddison (Trialist 46'), Mugabi (Trialist 46'), Sowunmi (Davies 46'), Smith (James 46'), Dickson (Trialist 46'), Browne (Trialist 46'), Bailey (Smith 46'), Gray (Trialist 46'), Khan (Trialist 46'), Olomola (Zoko 46'), Trialist (Trialist 46').

The use of new psychoactive substances (NPS) is steadily increasing. One commonly used NPS is methoxetamine (MXE), a ketamine analogue. Several adverse effects have been reported following MXE exposure, while only limited data are available on its neuropharmacological modes of action.
We investigated the effects of MXE and ketamine on several endpoints using multiple in vitro models. These included rat primary cortical cells, human SH-SY5Y cells, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived iCell® Neurons, DopaNeurons and astrocyte co-cultures, and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. We investigated effects on several neurotransmitter receptors using single cell intracellular calcium [Ca2+] i imaging, effects on neuronal activity using micro-electrode array (MEA) recordings and effects on human monoamine transporters using a fluorescence-based plate reader assay.
In rat primary cortical cells, 10 μM MXE increased the glutamate-evoked increase in [Ca2+] i , whereas 10 μM ketamine was without effect. MXE and ketamine did not affect voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), but inhibited spontaneous neuronal activity (IC 50 0.5 μM and 1.2 μM respectively). In human SH-SY5Y cells, 10 μM MXE slightly inhibited the K+- and acetylcholine-evoked increase in [Ca2+] i . In hiPSC-derived iCell®(Dopa)Neurons, only the ATP-evoked increase in [Ca2+] i was slightly reduced. Additionally, MXE inhibited spontaneous neuronal activity (IC 50 between 10 and 100 μM). Finally, MXE potently inhibits uptake via monoamine transporters (DAT, NET and SERT), with IC 50 values in the low micromolar range (33, 20, 2 μM respectively).
Our combined in vitro data provide an urgently needed first insight into the multiple modes of action of MXE. The use of different models and different (neuronal) endpoints can be complementary in pharmacological profiling. Rapid in vitro screening methods as those presented here, could be of utmost importance for gaining a first mechanistic insight to aid the risk assessment of emerging NPS.

In the past few weeks, President Donald Trump has, in no particular order: tweeted out anti-Muslim propaganda, disgraced a ceremony honoring Navajo code talkers with a racist slur of Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas,” called Kim Jong-Il “little Rocket man,” lied about not benefiting from the tax plan that will line their pockets, revived their bizarre birther claims about Obama's birth, and questioned the authenticity of their infamous Access Hollywood bus tapes. Ad Policy
News coverage of this nonstop carnival barking has missed the real story of the past month, however. These antics are a distraction from the pernicious GOP agenda that is moving through Washington with amazing speed.
Virtually unified Republican caucuses in both the House and Senate are on the verge of passing a truly grotesque tax bill that would give more than 60 percent of its benefits to the richest 1 percent of Americans, while those making $75,000 or less will end up paying more in taxes. The GOP is ready to hand global corporations a $500 billion tax bonus for booking profits in foreign tax havens. They're happy to protect the obscene “carried interest” tax deduction that gives billionaire hedge-fund managers a lower tax rate than their secretaries, even as they eliminate deductions for student-loan interest, and add taxes on to graduate students for tuition waivers.
Republicans are also poised to tax Americans on the income used to pay for state and local taxes, while allowing corporations to deduct those same taxes. Trump's major contribution has been to push for measures—elimination of the estate tax, elimination of the alternative minimum tax, lower taxes on “pass through” income—that will fill their own pockets.
The tax bill Republicans are trying to ramrod through the Congress provides a clear reminder of the real threat: the rabidly ideological Republican Party, which is looting the country just as it would have under a President Rubio or Romney. Trump had no clue about the policy and played little role in selling it.
Trump has also turned their economic policy over to Goldman Sachs bankers who are propelling deregulation of finance and rollback of environmental and consumer protections. Trump's cabinet isn't a bunch of outsiders but made up for the most part 0f Republican politicians and donors eager for the assignment. Now they're plundering the executive branch. Mick Mulvaney, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, is about to disembowel the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Scott Pruitt has neutered the Environmental Protection Agency. Jeff Sessions is leading a rollback of civil rights and criminal justice reform.
Beyond the economy, Republicans are busy rigging the system in other critical ways. Young, right-wing, pro-corporate ideologues are packing federal courts at alarming rates. Trump makes the appointments, but they mainly draw from lists prepared by the right-wing Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation. After obstructing a record number of Obama nominees to the federal bench, Senate Republicans are now trampling over longstanding legislative procedures to get as many judges on the bench as quickly as possible. Current Issue View our current issue
What we face in Washington and in statehouses across the country is a right wing that's ideologically committed to laying waste to the public sphere—the sinews of our economy, the comity of our politics, and the quality of our most basic public services. Trump isn't the exception; he's simply the sideshow. Right-wing populism was just the garb they donned for the campaign. What's left of it is largely limited to their incoherent trade posturing and the wall.
When it looked like Mitt Romney might defeat Barack Obama in 2012, the impish operative of the right Grover Norquist reassured movement conservatives not to fear Romney's supposed moderation. All we need, they argued, is a president with “enough working digits to handle a pen.” Republicans in the Congress will the agenda, and put the bills on their desk. That's exactly what is happening now.
Surely, ousting Trump would be satisfying, and many liberals are hanging their hopes on Robert Mueller. This would at least allow those afflicted with Trump-derangement syndrome to stop yelling at their televisions, but it isn't sufficient. The “resistance” has to get serious about the hard stuff of politics: winning elections up and down the ticket.
Democrats must organize to ensure that Americans register and vote in large numbers and end Republican rule. Railing about Trump's immaturity, ignorance, and instability won't get it done. Even their supporters get that. Their own secretary of state calls them a “fucking moron.” Progressives need to help voters also understand the damage wrought by Republicans from states like Kansas to the nation's capital. And Democrats need to make clear that there is an alternative that would serve the country and its people, not plunder the nation in the interest of the few.
This is going to be hard work, but it must be done. Robert Mueller won't clean the stables, no matter how that investigation turns out. The media's feasting on Trump's antics and outrages won't do it. The resistance is vital, but not enough. Americans in large numbers must rise up and throw the bums out. Elections—no matter how gerrymandered, no matter how many votes are suppressed, no matter how corrupted by big money—still offer that possibility. That will take new energy and activists organizing across the country.
Progressive leaders like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown, Jeff Merkley, Keith Ellison, and Pramila Jayapal are among the few Democrats that seem able to define the choice and the stakes. Progressive movement groups like Our Revolution, People's Action, Black Lives Matter, Indivisible, MoveOn, Working America, and others need to continue to build and drive a massive volunteer door-to-door mobilization. The tide of energized women voters can make a dramatic difference. In 2018, the election will be nationalized, but Trump will not be on then ballot. Voters must clearly understand the stakes.

Tony Abbott denies part in classified defence white paper leak; Mitch Fifield calls move 'unhelpful'
Updated
Cabinet Minister Mitch Fifield has described the leaking of classified defence documents as "unhelpful", as former prime minister Tony Abbott denied they were behind the papers going public.
Key points: Tony Abbott says they had nothing to do with defence documents leak
Senator Mitch Fifield says document leak serious, warrants inquiry
Some Coalition ministers say situation has created tension in the party
A report in The Australian newspaper referenced "several sections of the draft white paper" produced under Mr Abbott and former defence minister Kevin Andrews.
At the heart of the revelation was the timing of when the Government planned to have the next fleet of submarines in action.
The leaked documents allegedly reveal Malcolm Turnbull plans to deliver the next fleet of submarines in the 2030s, almost a decade after Tony Abbott planned to.
The report quoted Mr Abbott as saying they were "flabbergasted" by the decision.
Senator Fifield told Sky News the leaking of any classified documents was "always serious".
"It's important that governments, regardless of persuasion, can have confidential deliberations, particularly on issues of defence and national security," they said.
"It is entirely appropriate the secretary of the Department of Defence has initiated an inquiry.
"Obviously anyone who releases classified information isn't trying to be helpful.
"We are a good and cohesive team; we don't know where this particular leak came from, that's why it's important to have an inquiry."
Mr Abbott issued a strongly worded statement and denied any involvement.
"I don't leak; I don't background against colleagues. If I've got something to say, I say it," they said.
Senator Fifield defended Mr Abbott's right to comment on the leaked documents.
"Former leaders of the party and former prime ministers have a right to make comment," they said.
The situation has created tension within the Coalition, with sources telling the ABC it appeared Mr Abbott had broken their promise not to undermine their successor.
"Abbott's still in the angry phase — people are starting to get annoyed," one minister said.
"It's scrappy, it's just not useful," said another minister, but tried to differentiate the situation to what was experienced during the Rudd-Gillard years.
"The noise is coming from quite a small group; Rudd had a bloc of support."
A Coalition backbencher described it as "the last death roll of a past leader".
"If Tony Abbott had any thoughts of a return to the prime ministership they died with today's Australian newspaper," the backbencher said.
It is the latest piece of commentary from the former prime minister, after they urged the Government to chase further spending cuts and avoid changes to negative gearing.
Mr Abbott has also outlined their opposition to the Safe Schools program.

A violent thug went on the run and taunted police by posting pictures of themselves on Facebook wearing a silver wig and Dame Edna Everage-style sunglasses.
Michael Easy, 29, sparked a major police manhunt when they disappeared for the second time in less than two years after being handed a jail sentence in their absence at court.
The brazen criminal had breached a restraining order protecting their ex-girlfriend, who they attacked when they were four-and-a-half months pregnant.
They were also sentenced for leaving two prison officers in hospital when they assaulted them while doing time at Winchester Prison.
Easy was slapped with a four-month prison sentence in their absence at Southampton Magistrates' Court where they failed to appear for their trial.
Their disappearance led to a nine-day manhunt before they were finally tracked down by police and locked up once more.
(Image: Solent)
The court heard Easy, from Southampton, Hants, breached the restraining order when they were seen leaving a party with their former girlfriend, aged 19, in December last year.
Them family called the police because they were concerned for their safety as Easy had been found guilty in January 2013 of assaulting them when they were pregnant with their child - although in court Easy disputed the child, who is now in care, is his.
Before the conviction in 2013, Easy was also on the run from police and mocked officers by updating their Facebook page.
They uploaded photographs of themselves wearing a tacky platinum wig and pink Dame Edna Everage-style glasses, and changed their name to Michelle.
Pictures showed Easy pressing their finger to their lips - taunting police as they had failed to track them down. But they were caught and jailed for 15 months.
Mark Florida-James, defending Easy for their latest crimes, told the court their former girlfriend, who cannot be named, told them they thought the order was over and that when they left the party with him, there was no coercion.
(Image: Solent)
The crown applied for a new order to be imposed, with prosecuting solicitor Louise Holmes telling the hearing that while Easy's former girlfriend is now an adult they are 'extremely vulnerable' and has learning difficulties.
Ms Holmes said: "Mr Easy's history and their previous convictions clearly show they are a man of violence towards women and their partners."
The court was handed a statement from Easy's former partner asking not to impose the restraining order, but Ms Holmes told the court police believed they did this because they are worried for their safety.
The court also heard Easy assaulted two male prison officers in November 2014 after they tried to take them back to their cell as they had become argumentative and disruptive.
One was struck in the face, causing swelling to their cheek and after Easy was taken down from jumping on the net installed between prison floors to prevent suicides.
Meanwhile, they struck another in the face, causing facial swelling and a shoulder injury which required treatment.
Mr Florida-James said: "Mr Easy seems to attract trouble, they cause trouble, they admit that.
"He's now quite keen to have some sort of diagnosis to try to help them with these problems."
District Judge Anthony Callaway refused to impose another restraining order, telling the court the woman concerned is an adult and whether they see Easy or not was a decision for them
They sentenced Easy to 56 days for the 'serious' breach of the restraining order and a total of 56 days for assaulting the prison officers, to run consecutively.
They gave no sentence for failing to surrender.

Bank reported to be investigating how it would move operations back to Germany if referendum results in split from European Union
Deutsche Bank would consider whether to relocate some of its UK operations if Britain left the EU, according to reports.
The German lender is said to have established a working group to assess the consequences of a possible “Brexit” following an in/out referendum that David Cameron has pledged to hold by 2017.
JCB boss says EU exit could lift burden of bureaucracy on UK businesses Read more
A spokesperson for the bank told the BBC it was “early days and no decisions have been made”.
The Financial Times said it was the first financial giant to formally review its position and would consider whether to move some parts of the business back to Germany.
According to the company's website it employs more than 8,000 people in the UK, including at its office in London.
The news comes after senior figures at building equipment firm JCB suggested the UK would not suffer any adverse effects from leaving the EU.
Lord Bamford, a Tory donor, backed the idea of Britain leaving the European Union, telling the BBC the country could exist “peacefully and sensibly” on its own.
And JCB chief executive Graeme Macdonald told a newspaper that Britain should leave the EU unless it reforms, playing down fears that an exit could hit exports to the Continent.
They told the Guardian: “I really don't think it would make a blind bit of difference to trade with Europe [if the UK left an unreformed EU].
“There has been far too much scaremongering about things like jobs. I don't think it's in anyone's interest to stop trade. I don't think we or Brussels will put up trade barriers.”

Wells Fargo's customer account scandal is shaping up to be a blemish on the reputation of the nation's largest bank that doesn't appear to be clearing up anytime soon.
The San Francisco-based bank agreed to pay $185 million Thursday to settle a federal complaint that accused the nation's largest bank of creating 2 million fraudulent customer accounts.
More than 5,000 Wells Fargo employees were fired over the scheme in the last few years. The bank said it would implement new policies to prevent a similar incident in the future.
Much has been said about the incentives-driven culture in the banking industry, which is believed to have motivated the customer-account scheme. Business Insider's senior editor, Josh Barro noted this week that plots to open and close unauthorized accounts generally do not do anything to boost the bank's profits.
In an interview with Business Insider, crisis management expert, Eric Schiffer with Reputation Management Consultants said,"[Wells Fargo] created an an environment where the profit machine overcame any type of questionable activity. When you turn a blind eye then you are endorsing the behavior."
This latest settlement follows a years-long string of legal battles the bank has faced. Some of those cases involved claims of discrimination, illegal fees imposed on customers, and predatory lending practices.
Here's a brief history of Wells Fargo's legal headaches:
Illegal fees charged to student loan borrowers
In August of this year, the bank agreed to pay $4 million in fines amid allegations that it illegally charged fees to student loan borrowers between 2010 and 2013, the Los Angeles Times reported. Wells Fargo did not admit to any wrongdoing.
The crux of the case, according to the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, involved the manner in which the bank applied loan payments. The bank's methods allegedly caused some customers to be hit with multiple late fees.
Wells Fargo spokesperson, Jason Vasquez, told the LA Times that the allegations were related to practices that were modified "several years ago."

Bad mortgage loans and the FHA
In a US Department of Justice lawsuit, Wells Fargo agreed to a $1.2 billion settlement and admitted responsibility for false claims that its home loans qualified to be insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The penalty was the biggest in FHA history as it relates to loan origination.
The lawsuit also showed the bank did not take steps to fix thousands of loans that were improperly underwritten. When the loans went into default, the FHA — and, by extension, taxpayers — were left to foot the bill.
Other US banks like Citigroup, Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase faced similar lawsuits.
Accusations of predatory lending
In another federal lawsuit, the City of Baltimore claimed Wells Fargo targeted African-Americans with high-interest predatory loans.
The products — referred to as "ghetto loans" by some Wells Fargo employees — subsequently drove hundreds of borrowers into foreclosure and cost the city millions, the lawsuit said. The sales process in question was known as reverse redlining and involved selling defective and costly loans to African-American customers.
"Wells Fargo mortgage had an emerging-markets unit that specifically targeted black churches, because it figured church leaders had a lot of influence and could convince congregants to take out subprime loans," Beth Jacobson, a Wells Fargo loan officer told The New York Times.
Wells Fargo was among the banks named in a class-action lawsuit filed by the NAACP that accused more than a dozen financial institutions of discriminatory practices.
A similar lawsuit was filed in Chicago and Los Angeles, but was dismissed by a judge last summer.

The fallout
Since news of the the most recent case against Wells Fargo came out this week, the bank has publicly acknowledged the mistakes and announced it would provide training to employees in order to prevent fraud.
"Wells Fargo is committed to putting our customer's interest first 100 percent of the time, and we regret and take responsibility for any instance where customers may have received a product they did not request," the bank said in an emailed statement on Thursday.
Despite the fallout, some expect Wells Fargo will bounce back and repair its reputation.
"By no means am I trying to understate how significant this [crisis] is for Wells Fargo," Matt Rizzetta, CEO of public relations firm, North 6 Agency said in an interview with Business Insider, "but other brands have overcome much more adversity and much more severe crisis situations."
Which Android phone is best for me? We take a look at the top flagship Android smartphones of 2014 to see which will suit your lifestyle…
Android lovers have a bloody tough choice right now. If you're about to upgrade your smartphone, there's a really strong line-up of flagship Android mobiles to pick from – namely the LG G3, Sony Xperia Z2, HTC One M8 and Samsung Galaxy S5.
If you don't know which premium Android phone to splash out on, we've rounded up all four for a full comparison review, to see which one would suit you best – whether you're an avid gamer, music lover, or for some reason enjoy tramping through jungles…
Best Android phone for exercise and fitness fans
If you're always trekking through harsh climates or pissing around up mountains, you'll want a reasonably rugged mobile that can take a bit of abuse, and preferably one that can measure your efforts, so you can brag to all your mates about how really tough you are.
Two of the new Android flagship phones are fully water and dust resistant: the Sony Xperia Z2 and the Samsung Galaxy S5. You can submerge them in water for a full half an hour and they'll be none the wiser, making them perfect for swimmers who want to listen to tunes or take photos of fish.
The Galaxy S5 goes a step further too, with its built-in heart rate monitor. This can read your pulse via your pinkie before and after you train, to check how (un)fit you are. And with the nifty S Health widget, you can easily keep track of your activities and general health.
If you're after a really rugged phone that can survive endless tumbles from a decent height, you might prefer to snatch up last year's Galaxy S4 Active instead – or wait for the S5 Active to hit the UK.
Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5
Best Android phone for travellers/photographers
If you're always visiting exotic locales and you want an amazing camera to capture those stunning vistas, look no further than the LG G3. Its 13-megapixel camera is perfect for snapping on the fly, thanks to its ultra-fast laser-guided lens. Photos come out crisp and well lit, and you even get a brilliant fist-activated selfie camera if you want to include your grinning mug in each snap.
Check out our full feature on the best holiday camera phone for more info, and to see how the LG G3 stacks up against the Nokia Lumia 1020 and Apple iPhone 5s.
The Sony Xperia Z2 also boasts a great 20.7-megapixel camera with a smart Auto mode, which is easy to use and produces stunning shots. Travel fans will likely be a little disappointed with the HTC One M8's ‘Ultrapixel' camera, which can't capture as much detail as the other lenses here, although results are still bright and colourful. And the HTC One M8 has one advantage over the other phones here – it can survive for well over a day, even with regular use, thanks to its great battery life.
Winner: LG G3
Best Android phone for gaming and movies
All four flagship Androids boast sharp screens, five inches and over, but our favourite by a clear mile and a half is the LG G3's 5.5-inch display.
Not only is it bigger than the other screens here, it's also much crisper. The 2560×1440 resolution gives a boner-stirring 538 pixels-per-inch (ppi), compared with around 430-440 ppi on the other flagships. That means games and HD movies look even more stunning.
If you're hoping to watch a movie while doing other stuff, such as browsing the web or checking emails, the G3 is also your best bet. You can ‘fade out' video using the Q Slide feature, which keeps your film running in the background while you mess around with other apps.
And of course, like the other phones here, you have a microSD memory card slot for carrying around a massive media collection.
Our runner-up is the Sony Xperia Z2, with its beautifully vibrant 5.2-inch screen that rocks Full HD visuals. Bonus points for the HTC One M8 too, with its brilliant BoomSound speakers, which are a great way to enjoy media without the need for earphones.
Winner: LG G3
Best Android phone for music
Our favourite Android phone for enjoying a few tunes is the HTC One M8, which boasts the most powerful speakers here. Known (rather fantastically) as BoomSound, the dual speakers don't just blast out a powerful stereo sound, they're also pointed straight at your earholes (positioned above and below the screen).
The other mobiles here have speakers on the rear or edges, so the audio isn't as powerful. The Samsung Galaxy S5 and Sony Xperia Z2 also suffer from slightly muffled sound, an effect of the water-resistant design.
However, if you listen to your tunes using earphones or headphones, the best phone here is the Sony Xperia Z2. The Xperia has built-in noise cancellation, which works with the ‘phones bundled with the mobile. These ‘phones have mics that point outwards and pick up any background noise, and this info is relayed to the Xperia, which delivers a cancelling frequency straight to your ears.
Because the processing takes place on the phone and not in the buds themselves, this means you don't need to supply the earphones with their own batteries.
None of the smartphones really stand out for music in other ways. Sony's Xperia Z2 smartphone comes with a pay-for music streaming app called Music Unlimited, but you can download it on the other phones too – or an alternative service such as Spotify.
Winner: HTC One M8 (speakers) and Sony Xperia Z2 (ear/headphones)
Best Android phone for business and staying productive
With its smart Knox software, the Samsung Galaxy S5 is, in our humble opinion, one of the better phones here for staying productive with businessy shenanigans while on the move.
The built-in fingerprint scanner protects your sensitive data, and there's smart and secure cloud sharing so you can work on one document on multiple devices. And there's a clear line between your home stuff and work stuff too, so you can truly switch off when you're done crunching numbers.
Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5
Check out our full video comparisons between the LG G3 and the other Android flagships here.
Mr. Hawkins was 16 at the time of the killing, a native of Britain living on Staten Island with their mother. They had been dating a 14-year-old girl named Susan Jacobson when they broke it off. On May 15, 1976, the two went for a walk.
Image Susan Jacobson in an undated photograph. In 1976, when they were 14 and they were 16, Mr. Hawkins strangled them and hid their body in a barrel.
Mr. Hawkins, distraught over the breakup, strangled Ms. Jacobson and hid their body in a barrel inside of a 55-gallon drum. They then joined their family's search for the missing girl, calling out their name and pretending they had no idea where they are.
They eventually moved to Chicago to live with their father. Two years after the murder, they were arrested. They denied the charges and was convicted of second-degree murder after a trial, and sentenced to 22 years to life in prison.
They wrote a letter to Ms. Jacobson's family from prison about 10 years after their arrest, admitting the crime, they said.
Their first parole hearing was in 2000. Commissioners were clearly troubled not only by the facts of the murder, but also by Mr. Hawkins's deception of the Jacobson family.
“Even if they had been able to find them remains, there could be some closure if they knew what happened,” a commissioner said, according to a transcript. “You were all part of the hoax of looking.”
Mr. Hawkins agreed. Parole denied.
It would go this way at other hearings, in 2002 (“You continued to play into a hoax to lead them to believe that you cared about them and you cared about them,” a commissioner said) and 2004 (“Did you ever take anybody around or near the area where the body was, where the skeletal remains were found?”) and 2006 (“She was missing, and they tried to find them for a long time”). The commissioners changed, but the disdain for the act and the cover-up did not, year after year.
Previous Parts
Part I, Part II, Part III, Part IV
In The Seven Ages of Disney Animation – Part V, we are rescued from the mundane and boring previous age and vaulted to the wonderful heights that are quintessential Disney. Those in my generation were lucky to be smack in the middle of Disney's target demographic at this point in time, as we have not seen such consistently wonderful quality from the studio since. This is Disney's return to form, this is Disney's beauty realized, this is The Five-Year Renaissance.
The Five-Year Renaissance (1989 – 1994)
In 1989, Disney animation experienced a renaissance, producing four absolute masterpieces in only five years. This age, The Five-Year Renaissance, is defined by an unbelievable spike in quality which may never been seen again. The films in this era are The Little Mermaid, The Rescuers Down Under, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. Except for The Rescuers Down Under, the first theatrically-released sequel in the Disney canon, these films are gorgeous, brilliant, and among the best Disney has to offer. For the first time in a generation, Disney was able to offer compelling protagonists, great musical numbers, and memorable villains all at the same time. The result was a resurgence in Disney animation, the effects of which are still being felt to this day.
The Renaissance was kicked off with the story of a mermaid who falls in love with a human. The Little Mermaid recaptured the essence of Disney animation that had been missing since the release of 101 Dalmatians by offering a nuanced and gripping story based on another classic fairy tale. Coupled with beautiful musical numbers and fleshed-out villains – both clear hallmarks of this period – The Little Mermaid is quintessential Disney. We easily identify with the eponymous Ariel, as the teenage frustrations mount and cause them to enter into a rash deal with the frightening Ursula. The Sea Witch is one of Disney's most enduring villains, and they are a complex character with hidden motivations, nuanced ideas, and a forceful personality. Throughout the story, we get the feeling that their manipulation of Ariel is merely a means to an end, and ultimately that is quite horrifying.
Some criticize the quickness with which Ariel makes their choice to trust Ursula, or think that the chauvinism of Ursula's arrangement and villain song are unwarranted, but these choices are completely in service of the narrative. Of course Ariel reacts brashly to discipline – she's a frustrated teenager in love! And Ursula's sexist cajoling isn't being championed by the story, it is a manipulation of the naive Ariel. They don't understand love (especially on Land, which would be even more foreign to her), so perhaps (from Ariel's viewpoint) Ursula knows what they are talking about with regards to the relative importance of Ariel's voice and their body. This is the full strength of The Little Mermaid: the dramatization of naiveté and its absolution. We realize that there were times we made poor decisions on very little knowledge, and we come to understand that pain and adjustment as important for our development. We also get a singing crab. What a great movie.
Next was The Rescuers Down Under, the lone disappointment from this era. Given any metric, this sequel was a disappointment. It made less money at the box office, was poorly received critically, and contains a fairly rote story without much of value. The villain lacks any subtlety (the human one, at least – the monitor lizard Joanna is awesome), and I also care much less about the kid in this film than I did for Penny in the original. Interestingly, The Rescuers Down Under was only the second entry into the Disney animation canon without musical numbers (the other was they similarly panned The Black Cauldron). But, aside from a couple of beautiful Australian outback sequences, this film in entirely forgettable, especially considering the company in its cohort. In service of further comparisons, whenever I claim that something was the worst example of a film from the Renaissance, understand that I mean “besides The Rescuers Down Under” – this film has no superlatives of which to speak given the company that it was forced to keep.
One year later, Beauty and the Beast proved that The Rescuers sequel would be the outlier in this group by becoming the first animated movie to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. The timeless story is based on a 16th century French fairy tale and also borrows elements from Jean Cocteau's 1946 film of the same name (which is also fantastic, by the way). Our main character, Belle, is a beautiful bookworm intent on exploring the world beyond “this provincial life”, and whose intellect inspires unease in the townsfolk of their village. The Beast is a prince cursed to become a grotesque monster to reflect the cruelty in their heart. This curse can only be lifted if they learn to love another, while also receiving that person's love. When the Beast imprisons Belle's father for trespassing in their castle, Belle offers to take their father's place. The remainder of the narrative focuses on the development of the relationship between Belle and the Beast, but there is also a plot hatched by the main villain Gaston, first to force Belle to marry him, and later to kill the Beast.
The core theme of Beauty and the Beast is how outward appearances do not determine a person's value – not in general, and not with respect to romance. Belle finds a kernel of kindness in the ferocious Beast, and that is nurtured into a full-fledged romance, reminding us that superficialities are irrelevant in the face of true virtue. Belle's beauty is dismissed by the townspeople in their early musical number due to their personality. At the same time, the Beast's new-found kind personality is ignored due to their monstrous outer appearance. This is an interesting contrast – and speaks to a mob's ability to focus on the negative, unfamiliar, and different – rather than the good aspects of a person.
Three musical numbers from this film were nominated for best original song at the Oscars, and the musical lyrics are integral to the film in a way almost unprecedented in the Disney canon. Much of the characterization of Belle occurs in their song “Belle”, from the opinions of the townsfolk to their yearning for a bigger world. Crucial plot points like Gaston's idea to arrest Belle's father are delivered via recitative. The film is full of gorgeous animated sequences that imbue the world with an entirely appropriate magic and wonder. It may be the greatest animated film of all time.
The Renaissance continues unabated with Aladdin, the story of a poor street boy who falls in love with a princess. Inspired by the Arabian Nights story Aladdin's Wonderful Lamp, the strength of Disney's version is undoubtedly the performance of Robin Williams as the Genie who grants Aladdin's wishes. This performance was worthy of an Academy Award on the voice talent alone, and the stories of the amount of ad-libbing Williams did in front of the microphone are Hollywood legend. There is an initial wooing of Princess Jasmine which is both genuine and nuanced, as Jasmine is shown to be headstrong and independent. This process culminates with the absolutely timeless, “A Whole New World” musical number that is still one of the greatest Disney songs ever.
At its heart, Aladdin is an investigation of honesty and integrity. The audience empathizes with Aladdin's imposter syndrome while still recognizing that they are making a mistake by lying to Jasmine (and others), and their lies eventually catch up with him. And then there's Jafar. There may not be a Disney villain with more charisma or a more manipulative spirit, as we see them coax multiple people into their service throughout the film, only to quickly dispose of them. They remain a great character overall, but in hindsight they were the weakest of the Renaissance villains, if only because their motivation is a simple lust for power. There is great nuance in Jafar's actions and schemes, but none in their desires or dreams. In a way, this is a microcosm of the whole of Aladdin – it does everything very well, but the Academy Award-winning song and Robin William's performances are the only true moments of brilliance. It is bizarre to say it – but this is actually the worst overall film of the Five-Year Renaissance (not named The Rescuers Down Under, obviously). That is how strong the storytelling, animation, voice-acting and music composition was at Disney during this era. They truly were at the height of their powers.
In 1991, production began on two films at Disney: Pocahontas attracted the majority of the top animators and was pegged to be a rousing success while the remainder of the staff worked on a film with lower expectations: The Lion King. One of those films competes with the best Disney animated films ever, and the other marked the beginning of another Age of Inconsistency. The Lion King, released in 1994, was the first Disney animation based on an original concept (Kimba the White Lion notwithstanding). It did borrow certain elements from classic stories like Hamlet and the biblical stories of both Joseph and Moses, but the crux of the story is some synthesis of all of these elements. Thematically, it deals with the idea of growing up and accepting your responsibility. The Lion King uses familial power struggles to dramatize these ideas in a narrative that inspires from the opening musical number to the circular closing sequence.
Simba's arc takes them from a spoiled brat through a tragic and ashamed deserter and eventually culminates with their redemption as a proud, principled savior of the Pridelands. The nefarious Scar, perhaps the most complex and relatable villain in the entire Disney oeuvre, is brilliantly voiced by Jeremy Irons. We recognize all-too human characteristics in this gaunt animated lion, as the absence of a conscience combined with a believable brutality makes Scar absolutely terrifying. They certainly have the best song of any Disney villain, establishing their worldview and making clear analogies to various tyrannical ideologies in our world. Other musical numbers are no worse, either. The opening song, “The Circle of Life” may be the best introductory song in any Disney musical ever, and even songs that feel like filler (basically the two where Simba does any singing) dramatize their mindset beautifully and play key parts in developing their arc as a character. Of course, Elton John won an Oscar for “Can You Feel the Love Tonight“, making The Lion King the fourth film from the Five Year Renaissance to take home Best Original Song. The Lion King never wastes a moment, as each scene serves a grander purpose to the story of Simba's redemption, and as a result this spectacular film is never dull.
Disney's Five-Year Renaissance in the early 1990s was the greatest commercial success in this history of the animation studio, and is only bested in an artistic sense by the first five years of Disney animation features. It is important to make this commercial distinction between the two shortest ages in the history of Disney. While the Age of Innovation remains unrivaled in terms of artistic genius, the lack of commercial success was a significant factor in the decision to move towards package films, though the outbreak of the second world war certainly hindered overseas viewership. By contrast, The Renaissance produced three films which grossed #1 for their respective years, and led to an explosion of animation in the 1990s from Disney and other studios. Unfortunately, this renaissance was short, and the next age would produce the absolute worst that Disney had to offer.
June 28th 2009, the first coup d'Ã©tat in a generation in Central America overthrows the elected president of Honduras. A nationwide resistance movement is born, â€œthe National Resistance Frontâ€ which takes inspiration from the daring act of the farmers of the Aguan Valley to take over 10,000 acres of palm oil plantations claimed by the country's largest landowner, and a key player in the coup. Filmed over four years beginning with the coup itself, 'Resistencia: The Fight for the Aguan Valley' follows three key members of the farmers' resistance as they convert the plantations into a workers co-op and agitate for a more democratic state, all while trying to survive the violent reaction of the landlord and the coup regime.
This is the first time Resistencia will show in Toronto and filmmaker Jesse Freeston will be in attendance for a post-film discussion.

In 1964, a tsunami at least 20 feet tall slammed into Crescent City, Calif. The floodwaters came without a detailed warning, killing 11 people who did not get out in time.
In 2011, another tsunami hit the town, located at the northern edge of the California coast. This time, officials had hours of warning that allowed them to evacuate areas along the coast before the tsunami hit, which destroyed much of Crescent City's harbor.
The big difference? A tsunami detection system completed in 2008 that gave U.S. officials an accurate forecast of how big the tsunami would be as it hit America's shores and when it would arrive.
But now, the $12-million system is under threat. President Trump's proposed budget for the next fiscal year would end funding to operate the network, which would eventually shut it down. A House of Representatives subcommittee is expected to release details of its own version of the budget this week.

Forecast errors prompted invention of tsunami ocean sensors
The system is made up of 39 sensors installed on sea floors around the world and tethered to floating buoys that communicate with the nation's two tsunami warning centers by satellite. It was built after a false tsunami alert in 1986 caused a costly, unneeded evacuation of Honolulu's famed tourist district, Waikiki, trapping cars in the evacuation zone and costing the state tens of millions of dollars.

Trump's budget would also reduce the number of tsunami warning centers from two to one and slash staffing from 40 full-time employees to 15 — saving $11 million. And there's a proposal to end $6 million in grants given out to states to reduce tsunami hazards, which fund emergency drills and the drawing of flood maps and evacuation plans.
The proposed cuts come at a time when scientists are becoming more concerned about the damage potential from a huge West Coast tsunami. A government report published in 2013 found that a hypothetical magnitude 9.1 earthquake off the Alaska coast could produce a tsunami flooding areas of California where nearly 92,000 people live, including areas of Long Beach and San Diego, low-lying areas of southern L.A. and northern Orange counties, and coastal areas of San Francisco, Marin, Alameda, and Santa Cruz counties, along with the Crescent City area.

If a tsunami came during summer months, more than 1 million visitors could be on California's beaches and coastal parks. Officials have warned that it could be difficult to evacuate islands with limited exits.
Indian Ocean tsunami prompted new generation of tsunami sensors
It was the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, which killed more than 235,000 people, that underscored the dangers of an inadequate tsunami warning system.
At the time, the United States had only six first-generation deep-ocean tsunami sensors installed — all close to the western coasts of the Americas. Seismologists detected the magnitude 9.1 earthquake in the Indian Ocean and surmised a tsunami was possible. But there were no deep-ocean tsunami sensors in the Indian Ocean. No warning went out.

The disaster led President George W. Bush and Congress to back the creation of a U.S.-led global tsunami sensing system, which provides warnings of floodwaters sent by distant earthquakes. Besides the 39 second-generation deep-ocean buoys owned and operated by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there are now 21 other sensors operated by eight other nations.
Ocean sensors produced accurate tsunami warnings
By the time the magnitude 9 earthquake struck off the Japanese coast in 2011, the deep-ocean tsunami sensing system, known as DART, worked quickly and accurately — for Americans. Hawaii was given many hours of warning, and time for evacuations, before tsunami waves flooded homes and damaged a harbor in Kahului, Maui.
The forecast for Crescent City in 2011 proved precise — the forecast wave height for that city was 8.2 feet, and the actual wave was 8.1 feet, according to the California Geological Survey.

Faulty tsunami forecast system in Japan
But while the deep-ocean tsunami network worked for America, Japan's forecasting system woefully fell short.
The Japanese tsunami warning system and the general public expected a far less severe tsunami than the giant waves that actually rolled onto the shoreline from the magnitude 9 earthquake in 2011, according to Eddie Bernard, a former director of the U.S. Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.
If Japanese officials were using the American deep-ocean sensor data, Fukushima, home to the nuclear power plant that suffered a meltdown after floodwaters poured in, would have had 20 minutes' warning that the tsunami would overtop the seawall, Bernard said.
The Japanese government has since invested heavily in deep-ocean tsunami sensors, spending $500 million to install 200 sensors off its coast, Bernard said.

Lessons from a Hawaiian tragedy
Deep-ocean sensors can also detect major tsunamis when the earthquakes that produce them are surprisingly relatively small. In 1946, an earthquake that occurred in Alaska wasn't thought to be capable of producing a major tsunami. The main Alaskan coastline saw no rising floodwaters.
But a surprise tsunami quickly destroyed a desolate Coast Guard lighthouse in the Aleutian Islands before word could get out about the catastrophe.
Hours later, floodwaters struck Hawaii, killing 159 people, including about 20 elementary school children and teachers in one town alone. No warning was issued.
Scientists eventually realized that the earthquake ruptured exceptionally slowly, producing what experts now call a rare “tsunami earthquake.” It's an earthquake like this where deep-ocean sensors are especially important, said Gerard Fryer, former geophysicist at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.

How tsunami sensors work
The tsunami sensing system operates on a simple premise: recording the tsunami as it races through the deep ocean, before it strikes the shore.
Officials long ago realized that simply relying on how big an earthquake is in the ocean cannot accurately predict a tsunami. Sometimes, big earthquakes produce no tsunami, and at other times, a moderate temblor might conjure up a tsunami surprise.
The solution developed by NOAA scientists was to send ships into the deep ocean and drop sensors that would sink to the sea floor, according to Bernard, a key architect of the system. The sensors would detect the tsunami as it rushed through, and then send signals to a connected floating buoy that would send data to the warning centers by satellite.

Concern across the West Coast
A document explaining the Trump administration's plan acknowledged that “tough choices” were made to reduce funding, but “is necessary as we move toward a more efficient government that re-focuses on national security and core government functions.”
Members of Congress in both parties repeatedly have said they are more or less ignoring the administration's budget recommendations in drawing up the bills to fund the government's operations.
The administration's suggested cuts, however, do illustrate how hard it is to fund government operations within proposed overall budget constraints. How to deal with those limits and whether to change them is currently a top issue on Capitol Hill.
The possible cuts to the tsunami network — as well as Trump's plan to slash funding to an earthquake early warning system — have been met with concern by officials across the West Coast.
Once deep-ocean sensors are no longer maintained, the devices' batteries would die in about two years, Bernard said. U.S. tsunami officials would have to return back to 1960s-era technology — relying on only earthquake sensors and shoreline tide gauges, which are far more inaccurate, Bernard said.
“It's an absolutely reckless proposal,” said Rep. Derek Kilmer (D-Wash.), whose coastal district is at grave risk of a catastrophic tsunami. “These buoys are critical at keeping our coastal communities safe.”

‘Lives will be at risk'
A recent study found that accurate forecasts would help halve the number of people California would need to evacuate from a tsunami arriving from Chile, said Rick Wilson, tsunami scientist with the California Geological Survey. California would save $123 million in unneeded business closures.
Unnecessary evacuations can cause other problems. A big tsunami that might threaten San Diego Bay, home to a large naval base, would force authorities to make key decisions about how many ships they can safely get out of the harbor before it's too late, said seismologist Lucy Jones.
Mass evacuations themselves can be dangerous, Jones said, and can cause traffic jams and major upheaval. “You don't want to do it if you don't have to,” they said.

Kevin Richards, natural hazards director for the state of Hawaii, said the reason people drowned in past tsunamis is because officials didn't have technology to give precise warnings.
“You lessen that capability,” Richards said, “and yes, lives will be at risk again.”

UPDATES:
8 a.m.: This article was updated with context about how members of Congress in both parties have said they are more or less ignoring the administration's recommendations in drawing up bills to fund the government's operations.
This article was originally published at 5 a.m.
President Obama will spend next week laying out new proposals to improve Americans' cybersecurity, broaden access to the Internet and guard against identify theft, the White House said Saturday.
The shift in focus will lay the foundation for Obama's upcoming State of the Union address on Jan. 20, and follows trips around the country this week in which Obama emphasized manufacturing, housing issues and the improving economy.
Obama will spend most of the week in Washington, with events scheduled at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Monday and the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center on Tuesday.
 They are expected to announce new efforts to increase voluntary collaboration between industry and government on cybersecurity. At the FTC, he'll focus on ways to fight identify theft and improve consumer and student privacy, a White House official said on background.
Increasing high-speed broadband access will be a topic as Obama travels to Iowa on Wednesday.
The president will also meet with congressional leaders from both chambers and parties next week to discuss potential areas of common ground, the White House said.
Vice President Biden will also take part in laying out the pre-State of the Union agenda by traveling to Norfolk, Virginia on Thursday to announce new funding for job training in cybersecurity.

As this is a public-facing app, this challenge is overcome: we can use the regular public-facing app stores. Store the data: Depending on the anonymity of the data, there are various levels of challenge to overcome. If, as I suspect, the data recorded runs the risk of representing personally identifiable information, then this is going to have to be stored in a secure server (likely IL3), which means it will have to sit inside PNN (the Police National Network).
Depending on the anonymity of the data, there are various levels of challenge to overcome. If, as I suspect, the data recorded runs the risk of representing personally identifiable information, then this is going to have to be stored in a secure server (likely IL3), which means it will have to sit inside PNN (the Police National Network). Communicate between server and app: Again, as the server will likely sit inside PNN, reaching it represents a significant hurdle. There are well understood ways and means to do this, and plenty of advice from the home office and GCHQ on the matter - but no apparent will to actually perform this piece of work and stand up a gateway.
The over-arching challenge here, then, is to generate the interest and will from the departments and contractors that control PNN to allow the implementation of a gateway.
It's interesting to note that the components required to build the gateway are a series of VMs, each hosting freely-available and open source software to provide the various security functions required of it. The cost of building and maintaining it is negligible as compared to the staggering size of the contracts in place for today's IT systems. It is widely acknowledged that those systems offer poor value - and in many cases actually impede the work police officers do.
Even this incredibly simple app that directly feeds into public confidence and police performance is held up by bureaucracy - fueled by the distaste of incumbent suppliers and contract negotiators for flexibility or change.
As I've stressed in previous posts on this topic, police services could cut out this blockade and deliver new apps and services to police and public quickly, efficiently and at far less cost - simply by employing staff with technical skills - and will continue to argue for this.
In the meantime, we will continue to develop and innovate - as there's still no better argument for change than being able to demonstrate new skills, benefits, cost savings and rewards for police and the public.
Ultimately, we all want to make the world a better, safer place. The question is how to persuade the decision makers in policing IT that they should prioritise that as highly as we do.
Rory was the first person to explicitly state in their presentation something we were all thinking:That's why they go out every day to do what they do - to face not only danger, crime and disorder, but also the endless reams of bureaucracy and paperwork, seemingly invented to prevent the police from helping people.The police service currently relies on paper-based feedback, or telephone calls to find out just how well teams, departments and officers are performing. That makes it very difficult to record and analyse the thoughts, feelings and opinions of large swathes of those who interact with police - simply because there isn't the capacity.Rory's solution is much better suited to scaling quickly and much easier for members of the public to participate in - making it quick, easy, and cheap to give, receive and analyse feedback - and linking that feedback to specific incidents.His hack, aptly entitleddoes just that. It's an app that can be used by police officers or members of the public to take or give feedback. It collates that data, and makes it available to the appropriate teams.Rory's system relies on 2 components: the app, which interacts with the public, and a back-end services that retrieve, store, and present the feedback for analysis. That creates 3 challenges:
Heather Lynn, who used to work for WWNLive promotions Shine, Evolve and FIP, took to Twitter to talk about sexual harassment that they had to endure during their time in the wrestling business.
They wrote:

“It's part of the reason why I don't even bother being in the business anymore. There are some sick, sick people in it.”

Here is their response when someone asked if they were talking about Sal Hamaoui (WWNLive President/CEO):

The reason many don't speak up about it is because they are still in the wrestling business and because it's such a sexist business, they are afraid of losing their spots. I know I was. I kept my mouth shut because I was worried about not getting bookings. — Heather Lynn (@heatherlynn1024) November 30, 2017
They later wrote:
“The reason I am speaking out now is because I no longer have anything to do with the business side of wrestling and I don't need to worry about getting or losing bookings. Yes, I should have said something sooner, but it's also scary because wrestling is very much a “boys club” ”
“There are many girls who have gone through what I have, and worse I'm sure, but don't speak out because they are still involved in the biz. I get it. I have the luxury of being able to speak my mind now. It sucks when you stay quiet and go along with it to keep your bookings.”
“The ONLY reason I have not specifically named names yet other than to deny certain names is because I want to make sure that I am legally protected. Some of these people have more money than me and I don't want to have to face any legal issues.”
“I am not trying to be vague or coy, you can look at the companies I have worked for and more than likely put two and two together. I will be happy to deny anyone not involved though. I wish more women would speak up with me, but I get it and I will never blame them.”
Lynn tweeted this when they were asked to rule out Trevin Adams (president of FIP):

Hopefolly, Lynn's tweets will compel other victims to speak out. I am sure there are other people in the business that have similar stories to tell but have remained quiet out of fear of losing their spot or potential job with another company. Them tweets should serve as a reminder to people that this kind of stuff is not only happening in Hollywood and politics. It happens everywhere, including the wrestling business, and more stories like this getting might prevent more incidents from happening.
Check out some of the trending wrestling news stories below:
CLOSE USA TODAY Sports NFL reporter Lindsay H. Jones details the Adrian Peterson suspension and how it will affect him, the Minnesota Vikings and the league.
Commissioner Roger Goodell welcomed Adrian Peterson into the league at the NFL draft in 2007, and now they are suspending the running back for the remainder of the season. (Photo: Justin Kase Conder, USA TODAY Sports)
Vengeance isn't justice, no matter how Roger Goodell tries to cloak it.
The NFL commissioner didn't "get it right" by suspending Adrian Peterson for the rest of the season for abusing their 4-year-old son. They were unduly punitive. They were patronizing. They were petty.
Worst, Goodell showed that despite all those experts he's brought in, they and the NFL still don't have a clue on how to address domestic violence. And they don't really care to, or they would have shelved their egos two months ago, sat down with the NFLPA and come up with a policy that combines protection for victims, incentive to rehabilitate for offenders and compassion and support for all involved.
In other words, a policy that works. Not this make-it-up-on-the-fly model that only hardens the battle lines with the NFLPA and leaves the people who matter most – abuse victims – vulnerable.
Let's be clear: Peterson is not the victim. What they did in whipping their young son was reprehensible. There is never any excuse for beating a child so severely it left welts and bruises on the little boy's body, and Peterson should to be held accountable.
The legal system already has. The Minnesota Vikings running back was put on probation, fined and ordered to undergo a parenting assessment and, if needed, counseling after pleading no contest to a reduced charge of reckless assault two weeks ago.
Additional punishment from the NFL is appropriate, too. The league has turned a blind eye to domestic violence and sexual assault for too long, and its indifference has outraged the public and troubled sponsors. It needs to send a message to them, as well as its own players and personnel, that abuse in any form will no longer be tolerated.
A retroactive suspension for the eight games Peterson missed while on the commissioner's exempt list, coupled with mandatory therapy, parenting classes and the threat of further discipline if they do not show progress, would have gotten that message across.
That wasn't enough for Goodell, who has now gone from one extreme to the other. As bad as Peterson's initial crime was, the running back's refusal to accept Goodell as great and powerful, an NFL version of the Wizard of Oz, seemed to be equally unforgivable.
"The well-being of your children is of paramount concern," Goodell wrote in their lecture, err, letter. "In the absence of speaking to you to understand your current disposition toward child discipline, we cannot be sure that this conduct will not be repeated.
"Moreover, we are unaware of any effort on your part to acknowledge the seriousness of your conduct and your responsibility to demonstrate a genuine commitment to change."
Perhaps Goodell should take a closer look at those last few words – because they haven't, either.
The ultimate goal in this mess was supposed to be protecting women and children, not egos and territory. Yet Peterson's ban will do nothing to encourage women to step forward when they're being abused, knowing that they and their children are the ones at risk in the fallout – physically and financially – from draconian punishments.
It sure isn't going to encourage players to seek help, either, let alone work with Goodell to find a solution that truly addresses the problems of domestic violence and sexual abuse.
"This is a league that can do better," DeMaurice Smith, executive director of the NFL Players Association, told ESPN. "… There is a growing gap between the player and the league office. And that shouldn't be."
The NFLPA isn't blameless in this, mind you.
The vast majority of its members are good and decent men who are as horrified by the actions of Peterson, Ray Rice and Greg Hardy as the rest of us. But rather than finding ways to help the players and families who need it, the NFLPA just wants to howl about Goodell and their heavy-handed approach.
Really want to force the commissioner's hand? Come up with your own proposal that includes suitable punishments, treatment options and education. Get your players to sign off on it and then go tell the world.
Goodell promised back in September that they would "get it right" when it comes to domestic violence. They still have a long way to go.
Those of you who like your rockets liquid-fuelled and your altitudes suborbital might like to have a shufti at "Earendel", which promises to be "the first vehicle capable of reaching space, ie, greater than 100km, with an entirely open source design".
Earendel (left) - named for the Anglo-Saxon morning star - is the brainchild of Lloyd Droppers and Jasmine Cashbaugh, who are banking on "a single stage liquid sounding rocket ... powered by a 200 lb thrust Liquid Oxygen (LOX) / Isopropanol (Rubbing Alcohol)" motor to ultimately lift "a payload equivalent to a standard cubesat (1.33kg)" past the symbolic Kármán line.
The plan is to make all the documentation available to the unwashed masses, so they too can join the amateur space race. Some parts will be off the shelf, others printable in 3D, and the design is intended for self-assembly using hand tools.
At Earendel's heart is "a pressure-fed film-cooled* engine", which "runs at 180 psi for relatively low pressure tanks and produces 200 lb thrust". The blurb continues: "The design is a machined concentric tube chamber. The injector is a metal 3D-printed piece with integral inlet and pressure ports.
"It uses a sparse field of unlike doublet impinging jets** and film cooling - effectively boiling alcohol on the chamber wall to keep it cool. The engine is designed for ease of use, simple fabrication, and durability and is expected to achieve a sea level Isp (specific impulse) of 205 sec with a 90 per cent efficiency."
Rocket trajectory is maintained by "servo-actuated fintabs", controlled by a single Arduino Leonardo, which also does all the other mission computing work.
The choice of powerplant is interesting. Another suborbital rocket project - the Boston University Rocket Propulsion Group's Starscraper - recently hit its funding target on Kickstarter, and will head heavenwards using "relatively underdeveloped" hybrid motor technology.
The Starscraper motor uses hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) fuel and nitrous oxide oxidiser. Space aficionados will know that Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo engine originally ran on the same mix, although the HTPB was subsequently replaced with polyamide plastic fuel.
However, the first amateur rocket to officially hit 100km was the Civilian Space eXploration Team's "GoFast", which in 2004 thundered to an apogee of 115.8km using an ammonium perchlorate-based solid propellant.
Indeed, it's ammonium perchlorate composite propellant (APCP) that will power our own Vulture 2 spaceplane, so we asked Lloyd Droppers why Earendel will pack a liquid-fuelled motor instead of a simple solid-fuel unit.
They told us: "While it is true that solid rockets motors have fewer moving parts and are reliable once fully designed and tested, the design phase is as hard as a liquid engine design. Solid rockets also have high thrust to weight at take-off which requires stronger vehicle structure and a worse vehicle thermal load.
"We are using liquid propellants, but we are simplifying the system as much as possible by removing pumps and regeneratively cooled chambers, two of the hardest parts of the propulsion system. We also chose to use liquid-fuelled engines not just for this mission, but also due to the program's open source nature.
"A solid motor is hard to modify for a new mission but, for a liquid rocket engine, it is easier to modify individual components and have a community that updates and uses the system for their own missions - which is the aim of any open source project."
Well, we wish Earendel the best of British, and it'll be interesting to see how amateur suborbital tech develops during this new race for space. Naturally, our own plucky Playmonaut has decided they want a piece of the action when the time comes to reach for the heavens...

Armenia is on course to join the Customs Union with Russia, Belarus, and Kyrgyzstan by January 2015, after signing a "roadmap" in Moscow. Despite declaring its interest only three months ago, it may join earlier than Kyrgyzstan, which applied in 2011.
The news was announced after an official meeting between the heads of state of the three original members and two potential ones. The meeting also included Ukraine, which has observer status. Ukrainian Prime Minister Nikolay Azarov was present at the gathering.
“We welcome the interest in closer co-operation from the non-member states. We have approved the roadmap that will allow Armenia to join the union and the common economic area, and a similar document for Kyrgyzstan is virtually ready,” Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters.
The Customs Union, which seeks to gather all ex-Soviet nations to form a free trade zone to rival the EU, is the Russian leader's project.
Armenia's bilateral trade with Russia, its biggest foreign partner, reached US$1.2 billion in 2012 – a negligible amount for Moscow. Double digit growth has taken place, however, as the Caucasian country of three million people continues to recover from the effects of a severe economic crisis.
Armenia had long negotiated a potential Association Agreement with the EU, similar to the one that has been causing upheaval in Ukraine, but reversed course towards Russia in September.
Among the potential obstacles to effective membership for Yerevan are the lack of shared borders with other member states and the unresolved status of the Nagorno Karabakh region, which is contested with Azerbaijan. A special provision has been included in the roadmap, which will define the status of the region and whether it constitutes part of the Customs Union.
Kyrgyzstan's signing of a similar roadmap will be postponed at least until the next session of the union in March, following critical public comments made by the country's president last week.
Almazbek Atambaev told media in Bishkek that the roadmap had been “drafted without Kyrgyzstan's involvement” and risked subjecting the country to "social problems and instability."
Belarus and Kazakhstan are also not entirely agreed on the nature of the partnership between the member states, with Belarusian leader Aleksandr Lukashenko calling for wider diplomatic and political integration between the countries during Tuesday's meeting, and Kazakh leader Narsultan Nazarbaev retorting that the Customs Union “must not become politicized.”
President Putin nonetheless assured that the union is still on course to come into power on the long-declared date of January 1, 2015, with details finalized by May 2014.
“Next we must document the economic obligations of the member states to ensure that they are doing everything to ensure the free economic movement of goods,” said the Russian leader.
“Eventually we are hoping that the amount of exceptions that restrict free trade will be reduced to zero,” they added.
Growing up in the confines of a specific cultural environment tends to skew our understanding of fundamental aspects of human nature, and thereby hinders our ability to take full advantage of social game. It is crucial to wade through not only the fog of culture but also the bullshit of people's proclaimed truths in order to identify and explore the true motives of human interaction. I will start with specific ‘lessons' that I have garnered through experience and study, and then examine each of them in sufficient depth. This post addresses the first of these lessons.
Fundamental of Human Nature (FHN) 1
It's all about power
Whether an individual is being utterly nice to you or downright cruel, the base motive underlying all social interplay remains the same: power. We all have an intrinsic need to assert dominance over and to control others–those without sense of such power are undeniably miserable. This yearning for social power is distinct between the two genders, and plays out in specific ways, which I will explore a bit later. First and foremost, however, it is imperative to recognize that each individual you meet, speak to, or bond with, is after, primarily, power over you. This includes friends, parents, children, siblings, bosses, classmates, and everyone else you may know. This power is essentially a quest to fulfill a particular psychological need for dominance or superiority as well as a sense of authority.
It might seem as though I am tarnishing the very foundations of human relationships by asserting that even the ones we claim to love are in purist of power. In a sense, yes, this is true. ‘Unconditional' love or caring does not exist, even between the closets friends or lovers. The deepest relationships are tradeoffs, with power playing at least a sizable role. The only case where we as a species come close to unconditional bonding is in the face of death–which is why the strongest friendships are built during war or military service; the proximity of death tears away at several layers of psychological desire.
The takeaway here is simple: understand that no individual will be there for you unconditionally. They are all after something, and in the confines of social interaction, that need is power. They want to assert dominance, to make you feel subordinate, and to thereby control you, psychologically and emotionally. This is not something to lament. It is simply the nature of the human species, and a part of reality that we must accept and use to our advantage. We begin with this loss of innocence–no one is truly trustworthy, due to in-built psychological mechanisms that produce a drive for power.
Let's now explore how this power manifests in social interaction. For men, power rests mainly over other men, and is more about dominance that about control. This need for dominance takes various forms, with violence being the most common manifestation through the course of human history. Social dominance, at least in modern society, is now the norm, with ‘contests' for dominance rarely being settled by physical means. Social hierarchy is generally established through specific cues of communication: insults, aggressive tones, alpha body language, sarcasm, intentional disagreement, etc. Conversation between men is, thus, necessarily more aggressive and a clear contest for dominance. Men do not share a similar desire for dominance-assertion over women, focusing almost exclusively on getting the lay. Indeed, if supplicating and being meek were effective means of having sex with women, even the most high status men would employ those techniques. The male need for power, therefore, plays out in the form of contests for social dominance over other men (this includes even the best male friends).
In the context of power struggle, women are quite different. They're power is less about dominance and more about control, and is dependent not so much on social mechanics, as it is on their physical appearance. Women's social power, then, is more or less equivalent to sexual power. A beautiful woman (say, an HB10) is able to control male behavior to their will, and, by being a fierce competitor in the sexual market, derivatively controls their fellow females as well. Men will be willing and eager to provide them with resource, wealth and time for the chance to sleep with her, and women will want to associate with them socially so as to increase both their sexual market value (by association) and ability to meet high-status men (the kind of men HB10 would be able to attract). The female desire for power, or more accurately, the need for control, is strongly aligned to their appearance and sexual attractiveness. Interestingly, however, the man a beautiful woman is able to control is not the one they are most attracted to. Women intrinsically judge male status based on their subservience; fundamentally, then, the more difficult a man is to control (i.e. the less power the woman has over him), the higher their perceived status, and the greater their attraction. Female attraction is very intertwined with this cross-gender power play, and is the basis of sexual game. This is something I plan to address in many future posts, but for those of you with an immediate yearning, please read anything by Mystery or Style.
While a man's psychological need for power manifests in the form of dominance contests with other men (and is separate from their sexual desires) and is determined by both status and social cues, a woman's yearning for control is satisfied based on the extent of their beauty, and is fundamentally interlinked with their sexual mechanisms.

Forecast: 'Furious 7' to Race Past $100 Million This Weekend
Furious 7
April 2, 2015
Friday AM Update: Furious 7 got off to a fantastic start last night, earning a massive $15.8 million from late night shows beginning at 7 p.m. That's over twice as much as the last Fast movie earned from its Thursday night showings ($6.5 million beginning at 10 p.m.).
This is easily the biggest late night start so far in 2015. Compared to 2014 releases, it trails Mockingjay's $17 million, but is much higher than Captain America: The Winter Soldier ($10.2 million) and Guardians of the Galaxy ($11.2 million).
Based on this Thursday number, it's a foregone conclusion that Furious 7 earns over $100 million this weekend. It is follows Captain America's pattern—from the same weekend last year—it will wind up with over $140 million. A more likely result is something in the $120 to $130 million range.
Forecast: The seventh installment in the Fast & Furious franchise has a real shot at setting a new April opening weekend record when it opens in over 4,000 theaters this weekend.
The current record is held by Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which took in $95 million on this same weekend last year. Furious 7's predecessor, Fast & Furious 6, earned $97 million in its debut two years ago; it's tough to imagine Furious 7 opening much lower than that.
The history of the franchise is well-known at this point, but a quick recap seems in order anyway. In Summer 2001, moderately-budgeted street racing movie The Fast and the Furious became a huge hit in the U.S. with $144.5 million. The franchise stalled a bit after that: a sequel without Vin Diesel did fine business, while a spin-off lacking either of the original cast members disappointed with $62.5 million.
Eight years after the original, Paul Walker and Vin Diesel both reprised their roles in Fast and Furious, which opened to a surprising $71 million on its way to a $155.1 million total. Fast Five took the franchise to the next level with $209.8 million in the U.S. and $416 million overseas (twice as much as its predecessor). The series continued to grow with Fast & Furious 6, which earned $239 million domestically and a stunning $550 million internationally.
There's a realistic chance that Furious 7 becomes the highest-grossing installment yet in the 14-year-old franchise. Marketing has made clear that this is the biggest, craziest outing yet: there's more outrageous action, more crazy stunts, and a solid helping of one-liners to go with it. There's also a larger cast, including all franchise favorites and a handful of exciting newcomers (Jason Statham, Kurt Russell). In spite of all of that, advertisements overtly suggest that the franchise hasn't forgotten the theme that's resonated so much with moviegoers. As Diesel's character points out: "I don't have friends, I got family."
There's also a sense of finality surrounding this outing. Marketing material features the phrase "one last ride," which implies that this is, in fact, the last Fast & Furious movie (the chances of that actually happening is slim, but still). More importantly, the movie features Paul Walker's final performance after they tragically passed away in November 2013.
Production on Furious 7 was shut down immediately, and resumed months later with an altered script and with Walker's brothers serving as body doubles. The fact that this is Walker's final role—and that the movie reportedly goes to great lengths to pay tribute to him—makes this a must-see for even the most casual fans of the franchise.
The last Fast movie opened to $97.4 million over Memorial Day weekend in 2013. As of the last report, Furious 7 is outselling that installment by 34 percent on MovieTickets.com. It's also outselling Captain America: The Winter Soldier on Fandango. Universal also seems very optimistic, indicating that their tracking data points toward this being the biggest outing yet in the franchise.
Furious 7's biggest obstacle could be its non-theatrical competition. On Saturday, it faces the NCAA Final Four games; on Sunday, it goes up against the Easter holiday. It's practically a foregone conclusion that it makes over 40 percent of its weekend gross on Friday (that includes Thursday evening).
Furious 7 also opens in 63 markets this weekend, including all of the major ones except China, Japan and Russia (all of which will open in the next three weeks). The last installment earned $550 million overseas; while there's almost certainly more demand this time around, grosses could be suppressed by unfavorable exchange rates throughout Europe and Latin America. Still, a $500-million-plus haul seems all-but-guaranteed.
After playing at 28 locations on Wednesday and Thursday, The Woman in Gold expands to 258 theaters on Friday. Reviews aren't so hot—as of Thursday afternoon, it was 48 percent on Rotten Tomatoes—but Helen Mirren has plenty of fans, and this is the type of subject matter that has solid appeal with older moviegoers. A weekend gross north of $1 million is likely.
Forecast (April 3-5)
1. Furious 7 - $110 million
2. Home - $28 million (-45%)
3. Get Hard - $16.5 million (-50%)
4. Insurgent - $12.5 million (-42%)
5. Cinderella - $10.5 million (-38%)
Bar for Success
Considering how successful the last few installments were, the latest entry in the Fast & Furious series doesn't really need to improve on its predecessor. Anything above $90 million should be considered a win.

Kowloon Walled City was a crazy social experiment, except there were no scientists in charge; the test subjects were.
On the site of a dismantled Chinese fortress in Hong Kong, refugee squatters began building makeshift homes in the 1940s. What started out as 2,000 refugees in huts gradually grew into 50,000 people crammed into ramshackle, unregulated skyscrapers leaning on each other for support. (It's reported that no architects or engineers were involved in building the structures, which went up to 14 stories, but were somehow erected by the community that lived there.) And amazingly, it all formed a cohesive—and largely contiguous—structure, resembling a castle or fortress.

KWC had water and electricity siphoned from wells and the rest of the city, but was an unregulated mess of ad-hoc infrastructure largely unsupported by government. Police were afraid to venture inside (though unbelievably, mail carrier were reportedly forced to deliver mail there!). It was filled with criminals, drug dealers and prostitutes, as well as honest families, schoolchildren and one-man manufacturing shops. The following illustration shows what a slice of it might look like:
Tiny, cramped spaces did double duty, with units that were classrooms during the day transformed into strip clubs at night. There were restaurants and gambling dens, hair salons and convenience stores, unlicensed doctors and dentists. So close were the buildings that sunlight was hard to come by on street level; thus fluorescents were hung outdoors at ground level for illumination. Rooftops, meanwhile, became social spaces.

The government finally shut it down in the 1990s and razed it. But in the years during and since, Kowloon Walled City has captured the imaginations of everyone from architects to sci-fi authors to set designers to artists.
Speaking of artists, photographer Greg Girard, who documented KWC in the 1980s, probably has the best photo essay on it (shot both inside and outside) right here. We also wanted to show you the fantastic KWC-inspired work done by a handful of illustrators:
SWITZERLAND'S ITALIAN SPEAKING region has moved a step closer to banning the full face Muslim veil, after its parliament gave the proposed law the thumbs-up this week.
The canton of Ticino thus looks set to become the first region in Switzerland to introduce such a ban.
Following the green light from the regional parliament on Monday, the bill, which was backed by 65% of the electorate in a 2013 referendum, could take effect in April, a parliamentary spokesperson told AFP.
The regional government still needs to give its approval before it can be signed into law, they said.
The bill was inspired by a controversial French law introduced in 2011 barring women from wearing a niqab, a head-to-toe body covering, in the street, public gardens, shops and government buildings.
Fines
The Ticino government had urged parliament to apply the law to anyone covering their face in public, including masked hooligans or demonstrators, but the parliamentarians opted to single out the attire worn by Muslim women.
Once the law comes into effect, anyone wears a full-faced veil in the region risks fines of between 100 and 10,000 Swiss francs (€92 – €9,230).
The bill makes no exceptions for tourists, and Ticino is planning to display warning signs at airports and border crossings to inform visitors of the ban.
Some 40,000 tourists from the Middle East visited Ticino last year.

Cannabidiol for the treatment of psychosis in Parkinsons disease The management of psychosis in Parkinsons disease (PD) has been considered a great challenge for clinicians and there is a need for new pharmacological intervention. Previously an antipsychotic and neuroprotective effect of Cannabidiol (CBD) has been suggested. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to directly evaluate for the first time, the efficacy, tolerability and safety of CBD on PD patients with psychotic symptoms. This was an open-label pilot study. Six consecutive outpatients (four men and two women) with the diagnosis of PD and who had psychosis for at least 3 months were selected for the study. All patients received CBD in flexible dose (started with an oral dose of 150 mg/day) for 4 weeks, in addition to their usual therapy. The psychotic symptoms evaluated by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Parkinson Psychosis Questionnaire showed a significant decrease under CBD treatment. CBD did not worsen the motor function and decreased the total scores of the Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale. No adverse effect was observed during the treatment. These preliminary data suggest that CBD may be effective, safe and well tolerated for the treatment of the psychosis in PD. » more at: jop.sagepub.com Posted By Psychotrophic at 2009-11-28 12:50:14 permalink | comments Tags: parkinsons marijuana cannabidiol » More ways to bookmark this page

PF Bloggers Share Their Top Financial Resolutions for 2010
December is usually a reflective time of year, wouldn't you agree?
The end of the year is a chance to look back at our successes and failures throughout the year and also gives an opportunity to look at what we'd like to change.
I like to make New Year's resolutions as well.
Although I don't keep them all, it's fun to look back and see which ones I did keep.
I think it's important to set goals and make plans – it's what helps us get and stay on track.
Did you ever wonder what a Personal Finance Blogger might have as their financial resolution?
I have – so I hit the Twitter Streets again to ask this question:
What is your top financial resolution for 2010?
Here are the responses I received:
As you read through these, click on the Twitter handles and give these folks a follow!
Enemy of Debt ( @EnemyofDebt)
We are really wanting to complete our Fully Funded Emergency Fund of $15,000. Nothing provides financial security like having an emergency fund in place. This fund is very important to us because having this it will mean that we can move on to two other very important financial goals we have—which will be to fund our retirement with gazelle intensity and fund our children's college funds. One goal leads to another. Here's to a prosperous 2010 for us all!
Out of Your Rut ( @OutofYourRut)
Reducing expenses, building savings and paying off debt. We don't have much in the way of debt, but even a little is irritating (or worse!)
Bible Money Matters ( @MoneyMatters)
My financial resolution for 2010 is to get my financial life a bit more organized, and to practice what I preach on my blog. Within the past couple months my wife and I found out that we are expecting our first child, and that has really made me realize that I need to practice what I've been writing about when it comes to getting life insurance, setting up investment accounts now that we've fully funded our 8 month emergency fund, and putting together a set of instructions for my wife in case I were to die or become incapacitated. Now that we are no longer going to be a dual income with no kids family, it's time to get organized and motivated!
Consumerism Commentary ( @Flexo)
Continue doing things I enjoy and enrich my life.
Green Panda Treehouse ( @Green_Panda)
My goal for 2010 is invested at least $3k into my Roth IRA
Debt Free Adventure ( @MattJabs)
My top New Year's Resolution is to pay off all high interest debt and build my Emergency Fund up to $20,000. While doing this I also hope to accomplish my move to full-time PF blogger before 12/31/2010.
Miranda Marquit – Freelance PF Writer ( @MMarquit)
Refinance the house. Rates are low and we could [get] a 15 year mortgage for a little more than we are paying now, saving us big $$$!
Get Rich Slowly ( @jdroth)
To be honest, I don't have a PF resolution for 2010. I'm explicitly NOT setting a financial goal this year.
Everyday Finance ( @EverydayFinance)
My 2010 res is to continue to derive savings from 2010 fixed costs in our family and increase top line via blogging.
Wealth Pilgrim ( @NealFrankle)
Honestly, get my blog to earn a certain income (won't disclose) so I can justify my time.
Money Funk ( @MoneyFunk)
To surpass snowball plan by $5000 because I am eager to get out of debt and travel the world!
Good Financial Cents ( @JeffRoseCFP)
We're in the middle of completion of our new home and we've seen our emergency fund dip below the 12 month of monthly expenses mark that we like to have. Our goal will be able to get it back to our comfort zone, in addition I'll be hoping to sock away as much as we can into my SEP IRA. I like the idea of having a nice portion in cash and another working for us towards retirement.
Deliver Away Debt ( @DeliverAwayDebt)
Pay off my 2nd mortgage which totals $24,000. I want to pay it off next in my Snowball because I'm paying 12.75% on the dang thing. That is the highest interest rate of all my debts. I'm going to follow the 75/25 rule (by Matt Jabs). The 75/25 rule says that 75% of all available debt snowball funds will be put toward the debt snowball. The extra 25% will be used to fund (with CASH) other savings goals. I want to double my Emergency Fund to $2,000, Fund a $1,000 vacation fund, and begin my Wife's new used car fund.
One Money Design ( @OneMoneyDesign)
This coming year is an exciting one for us. We will become debt free except our mortgage by paying off our final car loan. We are already living out how paying off debt can free up additional money to meet financial goals such as snowballing debt and growing an emergency fund. It has also provided extra resources to allow us to give more when we feel called to do so. The emergency fund has been a difficult area for our family over the past few years. It seems each year something comes up that uses up much of it. We are grateful this system works as without our emergency savings we'd be facing credit card debt. So in general, the next goal will be building the emergency fund more to the point of further protection.
Change Jar Saving ( @ChangeJarSaving)
Pay off the credit cards! And have no more bills hanging over my head.
Upper Valley Mom ( @UpperValleyMom)
Move to a envelope system and budget that husband and I can both work with, in order to get some traction.
Being Frugal ( @Lynnae)
Pay off my student loan, because that's the last of my debt, besides the house.
Ducks and Dollars ( @skduck2003)
Pay off 4 loans (1 auto, 3 student) & increase savings in an effort to reach financial freedom!
Financial Highway ( @MoneyHighway)
We are just changing priorities from saving to paying off Student loan so main goal is to reduce student debt (only debt we have) by 40-45%.
Linsey Knerl from Wise Bread ( @WiseBread)
My top resolution (Linsey Knerl) is to give more in 2010. I feel so blessed, and I would love to see my blessings help others.
SF Personal Finance Examiner ( @UpsideofMoney)
To take my own advice. For example, I handle my son's Roth IRA account and I've built it the right way from the start; I've used textbook-classic investing and he's up 56% this year. My own Roth account is only up 23%, has a hodgepodge of mutual funds, and needs a good dusting. And of course my son is only 17 with a time horizon of 45 years, and I am looking at retiring in the next ten. 😉
Thrifty App ( @ThriftyApp)
Try something frugal each month that I haven't been able to bring myself to do. January=handkerchiefs. We'll see…
Fiscal Fizzle ( @FiscalFizzle)
At the top for 2010 is getting serious about retirement. It's been on the backburner for too long and I'm losing time.
Credit Goddess ( @CreditGoddess)
Start a home improvement fund. Bought a house in 2009 & want to make some changes.
Foreigners Finance ( @ForeignerFinan)
3 quality posts a week for 52 weeks to prove to myself and my readers I can continue to create solid content.
Steadfast Finances ( @Matt_SF)
I'm hoping to beat the @LendingClub ROI of 9.6%. If I can, I'll scale up my pilot portfolio.
Centsible Life ( @CentsibleLife)
My top resolution is to continue to increase our earnings every month. More money=out of debt faster!
Small Steps For Big Change ( @SS4BC)
To be debt free? Why? Well shouldn't that be evident? =)
Rainy Day Saver ( @RainyDaySaver)
To finish paying off our credit card debt and add extra principal payments to the mortgage
My personal finance resolution is to make 6 figures in 2010 selling my products from my blog! I'll use that money to save for a house.
Personal Finance Notebook ( @patreniaspears)
A goal for 2010 is to fully fund our emergency fund.
Free From Broke ( @FreeFromBroke)
My resolution is to keep looking at my life and see what I can do to improve it everyday.
Arohan's Investing Life ( @Arohan)
I want to start and grow a new business in 2010 to a level that allows my wife to quit their job and raise our kids. So I am looking to generate new income stream and improve family time. This way they can also work part time if they want. I also plan to pay off the only non-mortgage debt we have (personal loan, about 20K).
Kingdom First Mom ( @KingdomFirstMom)
To practice what I preach (use coupons effectively, pay off debt, build savings)
My Money Power ( @myMoneyPower)
My PF Res is to Be Happy. A positive outlook can make a big impact in your finances. There are studies showing depression leads to spending.

Hi Freifunk and GSoC communities!
Finally we arrive at the end of the summer and also at this third final evaluation of GSoC!
I'm proud I have participated to this edition of GSoC and I am thankful for this opportunity.
This past month I did a lot of new work and a lot of interesting improvements.
One of the funniest and visible things are the implementation of the 8biticon library that provides a reliable avatar face generated using GXS id as input, it is reliable in the sense that having the same GXS id as input will generate always the same avatar.
The nice thing about this is that it can be used as an user friendly way to verify identities, the user doesn't need anymore to check long fingerprints but they can do a quick verification just by looking at the generated face.
Another interesting thing I have implemented is sending little files and images via chat using data URL. This works encoding a file to base64 and send it with a header specifying the mime type. The maximum file size is 60KB, and for images, if it's bigger than that or if it's size is more than 160×160 pixel, the program resizes it to fit.
This branch results very interesting for me because it uses all the things that I learned this summer: call C++ code from QML, call Android Java code from C++ interact with Android OS, create custom QML components from C++ code…
Of course, a big part of work has been to find and fix bugs, on Android and on desktop. At the moment the last commit has little known bugs that I'm going to solve as soon as possible.
One of these bugs causes program crash on some Android devices when send or receive an emoji. This happens because I implement an alternative emoji font if no native compatible emoji font is found. On Android, the Android Emoji font is who provides the typography of emojis, but in some devices its not shown. So I decided to integrate the OpenSansEmoji project. That way, when the program doesn't detect a compatible emoji font, it uses the OpenSansEmoji.
But the implementation of that is not working as good as expected and causes the crash mentioned above.
Another typical work has been to improve the UI aesthetics in little things: correct a height in one place, change the color somewhere else, draw a line separating the contacts. I create a custom button component with animation and the possibility to attach to them an icon. This is done thinking about to also centralize the application style sheets.
And thinking about the end user, I tried to improve how the user share or import the nodes identities. I put a shortcut on the menu to share identity, and also refactor a little bit the import/export trusted nodes view, making an informative popup that shows you a little bit of information about each option.
Also I have done some little attempt to implement key exchange using the device sound card using libquiet available in C, Java, JavaScript and more languages.
This is a very interesting functionality that would improve the key exchange process and make it user friendly.
The functionality is not implemented yet as I believe it would take more time then the GSoC as it seemed more difficult than we thought initially, but I would like to continue working on this topic in the future.
In the latest days I have been working with my mentors to do the final polishing and integrate most of the code in RetroShare official repository master branch, most of the code have already been merged as you can see in this commit e06bffdb by one of my mentors.
As always you can find all the code and activity track on my gitlab repository, I also suggest taking a look to the detailed technical report and if you are eager to test the results on your phone you can download the Android Package too.
Finally I want to say goodbye, and again appreciate the opportunity to participate to this exciting GSoC!
We enter a lot of passwords into smartphones nowadays. Social networks, emails, even bank accounts, they are all in there. There's an understanding with anything stored digitally that there's no such thing as “completely secure”, but there's also an expectation that risks are being minimized by all of the parties involved. With the Samsung Galaxy S3, easily the most popular Android smartphone on the market right now, this may not be the case. Recently it has been discovered that Samsung's own S-Memo app is storing passwords in plain text, which means anyone who knows where the file is stored and has access to the file can read it.
When you have a rooted Android phone, it's widely understood that all bets are off as far as vulnerabilities are concerned. Just like in desktop Linux, superuser access means you can break whatever you want, and the OS will do very little to stop you. With Android phones, it means you now have access to every file on the device. The S-Memo SQLite files are only accessible to those with root access, but once you have access to the file you can pull whatever you want from them. This includes your Google Account password, which you surrendered to S-Memo when you logged in to your Galaxy S3. Instead of protecting that password by encrypting it, the password can simply be copied and pasted for use on anything.
The volume of people this affects immediately is fairly small, but it exposes a vulnerability that could be used to grant a malicious user access to your Google Account. On an Android phone, that's not far from being your entire digital existence. While rooting a Samsung Galaxy S3 only takes about five minutes, the software tools required are uncommon enough that as long as your phone isn't already rooted you likely don't have anything to worry about.
Given the severity of the discovery, I would expect Samsung to respond quickly and update the S-Memo app to hash or encrypt the passwords in S-Memo.

Steve DeAngelo is preparing for the marijuana gold rush following state-level legalization of the drug with The ArcView Group, a company poised to pave the way for bringing high-tech cannabis products to consumers nationwide.
DeAngelo visited the hosts of The Cycle on Friday fresh from a pitch meeting with Wall Street investors looking to strike it big by getting in on the ground floor of the legal cannabis industry. DeAngelo says that their group works with these “angel” investors by presenting products and services, “that are really going to professionalize the cannabis industry and help it move into the mainstream of American life.”
Their company positions itself as a one-stop shop for business services to the legal marijuana industry, and if DeAngelo's vision pans out, ArcView could become a key player in the financial infrastructure of the domestic marijuana market.
A Bay Area resident, DeAngleo embraces the mining metaphor native to ArcView's home of San Francisco, saying that their company does not work in the marijuana trade, but on, “The picks and the shovels rather than the cannabis itself.”
Lawful sales of marijuana will top $1.5 billion this year and could quadruple by 2018, according to a report featured in Medical Marijuana Business Daily. The total market including illegal sales is estimated at anywhere between $10 to more than $120 billion a year by CNBC. National legalization—which is still a hypothetical scenario—could save the U.S. up to $13.7 billion in tax revenue and reduced law enforcement costs, according to a 2005 Harvard economist report.
A recent Pew Research Center poll found that for the first time that a majority of Americans support marijuana legalization. DeAngelo is hopeful that the public's will, can translate to legal reforms, “We're going to see complete legalization of cannabis well within my lifetime,” they said. DeAngelo points to the 18 state governments that have already reformed marijuana laws as an indicator for the direction the county is heading on the issue.
In addition to their work with the ArcView Group DeAngelo is currently engaged in a pair of lawsuits against the federal government's attempt to close medical cannabis dispensaries. “We've had many many years of misinformation and outright lies being told about this plant,” DeAngelo says, adding, “Cannabis is a natural healthy alternative to many of the more dangerous pharmaceuticals.”
Do you think the current wave of marijuana legalization will soon have the federal government saying “Yes we cannabis!”? Leave your response in the comment section below.
A Fix For Gender-Bias In Animal Research Could Help Humans
Enlarge this image Katherine Du/NPR Katherine Du/NPR
There's been a male tilt to biomedical research for a long time.
The National Institutes of Health is trying to change that and is looking to bring gender balance all the way down to the earliest stages of research. As a condition of NIH funding, researchers will now have to include female and male animals in their biomedical studies.
As late as the 1990s, researchers worried that testing drugs in women who could be pregnant or become pregnant might lead to birth defects, so experimental drugs were mainly tested in men. Research in animals followed the same pattern.
"There was not the understanding that it really isn't scientifically appropriate to study men and apply your findings to women. We just didn't know that back then," says Dr. Janine Clayton, director of the Office of Research on Women's Health at the NIH.
When the drugs this way finally went to market and women took them, sometimes things went wrong. To try to fix the problem, the NIH and Congress required that women and men be included in research involving human subjects.
Now, there are more women than men participating in clinical trials, at least in studies funded by the NIH. But there's still a mystery: Why do women still report many more bad reactions to medications than men do?
"Men and women respond to medications differently. In fact, one study looked at the drugs that have been taken off the market and 8 of the 10 drugs taken off the market in that particular time period had more severe effects in women," says Clayton.
They think the problems that women experience when they take medications could stem from how biomedical research is conducted at the earliest stages – in animals.
"Eighty percent of drug studies that are done in mice are done in male mice," says Clayton.
Studies in mice are important because the results often inform what will be tested in humans.
It's not as if people are ignoring female animals because they're chauvinists. Some researchers say females have been excluded from studies because their hormone cycles can confound the experiments, though the actual variability that the estrus cycle introduces is debatable.
And in some cases, research has been skewed the other way. Male animals are sometimes excluded from studies because they fight with each other, which can complicate results, and because the males sometimes have to be caged separately, which can drive up costs in cash-strapped labs.
In other cases, studies are done on both male and female animals, but the data on each sex don't get reported separately.
All in all, Clayton says, researchers are missing indicators early on about how different bodies would respond to medications. "We're learning late," they say. "That's not the best way to do this. We need to study both sexes throughout the entire research spectrum."
So, Clayton and their colleagues drew up a policy starting Jan. 25 that applies to NIH-funded biomedical research starting January 25 on out involving animals with spines. "We're asking scientists to think about sex, to study both male and female animals in their preclinical research so that we can learn more about both male and female biology," says Clayton.
When the policy was first announced, people were pumped about it, says Sarah Richardson, a professor at Harvard who studies the history and philosophy of science. "People were like 'Absolutely, that's terrible. Why aren't they studying female mice?' That was my response, too," they say. "It was seen as just a straightforward obvious corrective that we have to do."
But they and other researchers maintain that if the goal is to address women's health inequities, the policy on animal research isn't likely to be effective by itself. Mice aren't people. Richardson also says the focus on animals could distract scientists from the big picture: what happens in real living humans.
"Women on average, in North America at least, take more prescription drugs than men do," they say. "Women also go to the doctor more. We all know this — we cannot get the men in our lives to go to the doctor. They are also for whatever reason more likely to be sensitive to and prone to report feelings of discomfort," they say. "So, what we thought when we reviewed this literature is, OK, if the NIH is really wanting to address this, we need tons more studies of just those kinds of factors," says Richardson.
The NIH put $10 million toward helping labs add sex and gender to their projects. But if they want to figure out health differences between men and women, Richardson says, they need to also put money towards understanding what drives differences in human behavior.
It's not always simple to account for sex and gender in research projects, says Stacey Ritz, an immunologist at McMaster University in Canada who wrote a guide on how to do so. "I've really struggled with it for many years," they say.
They say in most cases it's pretty straightforward to do a male-female comparison. But there's a danger in assuming that a difference noticed between male and female animals stems from a difference in their basic biology, rather than because of something else, like how the male animals might have been housed alone while the female animals were housed in groups.
"That's one of the things that concern me," says Ritz. "A lot of times the questions around social dynamics and gender get glossed over and it's assumed — especially with animals — that differences you see between male and female are purely biologically driven," says Ritz.
Neurologist Rhonda Voskuhl, at UCLA, agrees that mice aren't going to reveal all the intricacies of why human men and women can have different health outcomes. "There's no perfect model for the human except for the human," says Voskuhl.
But in many cases, they say, animal studies can uncover important findings that can make a difference for people.
Voskuhl has seen that firsthand. They direct UCLA's research program on multiple sclerosis. They say for quite a while, researchers didn't report the sex of animals they studied, though many studied mainly male rats. When they started looking more closely at female animals, they realized the disease progressed differently in them.
That knowledge has led to findings about how to treat multiple sclerosis in women, including the idea that a pregnancy hormone could relieve symptoms, an approach that's in clinical trials.
"The point of the story is, you may not think there's anything there until you study it," says Voskuhl.
They say research on animals and humans goes hand in hand. If researchers study and report data for both sexes, that may well dredge up new treatment possibilities in people.
A similar case came up in Jeff Mogil's work studying pain at McGill University in Canada. They say a few decades ago, people primarily studied male animals, which they'd order from a company. The lab they worked in studied both.
"And because of that I've been in a position to see sex differences where other people in my field haven't simply because they never had female mice lying around," says Mogil.
By studying both sexes, Mogil and their colleagues found that different cells communicate pain in female and male animals. "They experienced pain in the exact same way and to exactly the same degree, but the pain is produced and modulated using different circuits," Mogil says.
If the same is true in people, that difference could have big implications for a class of painkillers meant to work by blocking the cells that are more active in men. "The prediction would be those drugs simply won't work at all in women. It's not that they'll work better in women and worse in men. It's that they won't work in women period," they say.
And, they say, if people running clinical trials on that drug didn't know that it only worked in men, they might look at the trial data, see that it only worked in half the participants, and just ditch it entirely.
It has been years since my Subway sandwich artist days, but I think I could still make a delicious sub if put behind the counter. I worked there for over three years, during which time I noticed a few odd things. One thing was the roast beef. There was always some green gasoline-like sheen on the slices of deli meat (see right). Whenever I had to make a sub that had roast beef I'd get nervous and concerned the customer would ask what it was – I had no idea – until today.
When reading a story in the Sun Chronicle Online about a Massachusetts Subway's green roast beef, the memories came back to me and I decided to do some investigating.
A co-worker who worked in a meat laboratory explained to me, and this University of Saskatchewan paper on meat colour agrees, that the odd colour I was seeing was likely due to light reflections on sliced meat muscle fibers (which is not a food safety issue).
From the paper,
Iridescence is a common problem in sliced roast beef and ham products. The dominant color is frequently green and consumers sometimes confuse this with green myoglobin pigments associated with microbial growth. The iridescence of meat products is produced by a combination of the angle of incidence of the light on the muscle fibres and the wetness of the surface. If the fibres are pulled slightly out of alignment during slicing, the light strikes the fibre at an angle scattering light which
appears as the rainbow or greenish color on the surface of the meat.
Whether or not this explains the green on the Massechusetts Subway's roast beef, I do not know, but does answer a question I forgot I had.
A reader sent in this recent presentation from SDOT's Bridge Maintenance Program, and it's pretty grim reading if you care about the quality and serviceability of Seattle's streets and bridges. Some of the top line numbers have been out there for a while, but they bear repeating:
SDOT's deferred maintenance backlog was $1.8 billion in 2010.
in 2010. To “break even”, and prevent the backlog from growing, the city needs to spend about $190 million per year on maintenance.
per year on maintenance. The city is currently spending $50 million per year.
per year. The Bridging the Gap program does not come anywhere close to reducing this backlog.
This reinforces a point which Martin and guest contributor Alex Broner made recently: there is an effectively infinite amount of work which could be done in Seattle with 18th-Amendment encumbered gas tax money to bring our roads back into a sound condition. Gas tax, as Martin has pointed out, is extremely efficient to collect, provides an excellent incentive to consume less fuel, requires no new legal or bureaucratic structure, and carries no privacy concerns.
In a rational universe, voters and political leaders would understand that fixing existing problems is a high priority, and would move to address them as such; instead, leaders promote shiny new projects that are almost certainly less essential, and voters continue to reward them for doing so. Road maintenance spending has become like bus stop consolidation or route restructuring: work that's crucial to our future as a dense and growing city, but is prevented by the direct democracy and political culture of our present.
Kelly said the two deputies had not returned to work. They said the department is in the process of determining whether they should be placed on administrative leave or reassigned to non-public contact positions.
"We're obviously in the early stages," they said.
Original Post 7:50 p.m. Friday Nov. 13:
The San Francisco Public Defender's office has released surveillance video showing two law enforcement officers repeatedly beating a man with batons.
The video posted to the public defender's YouTube site initially identified the officers as San Francisco police, but was recently updated to identify them as Alameda County Sheriff's officers.
"Update: Alameda County Sheriff officers, after chasing a driver across the bridge and then on foot, beat the man with nightsticks in San Francisco's Mission District," the video's caption says.
“It's extremely disturbing,” Public Defender spokesperson Tamara Aparton told the San Francisco Examiner. “[The victim] doesn't appear to be resisting at all. We want to find out the circumstances of their arrest, and the extent of their injures as soon as we can.”
Alameda County Sheriff's Sgt. Ray Kelly said the office was just alerted to the video and is reviewing it. They did confirm Alameda County Sheriff's officers pursued a suspect from San Leandro into San Francisco early Thursday.
The video was shot at the corner of Stevenson Street and Clinton Park, two Mission District alleys, apparently by a security camera.
Kelly said an Alameda County officer identified a stolen Mercedes in a hotel parking lot and called for backup. When two officers contacted the male driver, they drove into a squad car, injuring an officer's leg.
"He then rammed a second police car and was able to make their way out onto Foothill Boulevard after pushing all the police cars out of the way," Kelly said.
The ensuing pursuit lasted 45 minutes and took a detour through Oakland before resuming over the Bay Bridge, Kelly said.
Kelly identified the suspect pursued by Alameda County deputies into San Francisco as Stanislav Petrov.
"The suspect fled from the car and resisted arrest and was captured and arrested," Kelly said, reading from a report. "He had injured that required them to be admitted into the hospital."
Kelly said officers found a loaded and cocked handgun on the passenger seat of the Mercedes.
The Examiner reports witnesses to the incident contacted the Public Defender's Office about what they saw and passed along the video.
Apparently, we're going to be enjoying some donuts tonight with our football snacks. Dunkin' Donuts is going to premiere an ad that's simply an entire Vine video.
Let's see how we like it, then meet back here to discuss.
In the meantime, here's a Vine video of a Dunkin' Donuts TV ad, which is starting to get really complicated to think about in context with this story:
==================================
UPDATED 9/10/13, 9:30 a.m. or so
Okay, so I confess: I'm playing keyboards in a rock band for a charity thing on Saturday and was at practice last night during Monday Night Football. I think I was probably playing the lead lick on Wilco's “Always In Love” on my vintage Yamaha monophonic synthesizer when the Dunkin' Donuts Vine ad aired.
I figured it would be mentioned someplace on the web and I could watch it and we could share our opinions together, and drink coffee and chuckle with each other. It's kind of hard to find anything about it. Goes to show you get all your PR before you do something.
Is this it? This is what I found:
So I like the fun of the event of TV's first Vine ad (they used it as a “billboard” instead of just their logo, apparently). That's cool. I also admire the quick turnaround if I understand correctly that this little scene is a replay of a play during the actual game—impressively quick Vine creation. That wins them some affection. So: novel, and impressive turnaround. Two great things.
I also think it could wear thin pretty quickly when the gimmick effect runs out.
But it hasn't run out yet.
It helps that Dunkin' Donuts is a playful brand, and has a history of farting around with technology and stunts.
And not every ad can become a part of our cultural heritage, uttered by every sleepy worker who has to stand up and do what needs to be done. That standard is too high, and can't usually be achieved deliberately and with calculation.
My Conclusion:
So I think (if that Vine I embedded is the Vine all the hoopla is about) it's a successful PR stunt to have the first Vine billboard ad on Monday Night Football, and it's cool to do it so quickly. It ain't “Time to make the donuts” (or even one of my favorite campaigns, with They Might Be Giants doing what seems like a couple dozen different little songs for them). But it keeps Dunkin' Donuts looking alive and awake.
Perfect for a brand dedicated to getting you going in the morning.

Protestors with the Nez Perce as well as Wild Idaho Rising Tide and Idle No More turned out for a third night of demonstrations against the illegal megaload's passage through Nez Perce country.
Yesterday's police was the largest yet, taking the side of Omega Morgan rather than the law. According to Wild Idaho Rising Tide, the police were “more forceful this time. Using their cars and phalanx tactics they forced a way through the crowd and broke the blockade faster than on other nights. The megaload took off and fled, tail between its legs, and proceeded to break laws (AIDED by the cops!) and endanger people all the way to get itself off the Res. before stopping for the night, terrified of facing the Nimipu on yet another night.”
WIRT is calling on the US Forest Service to “step up to the plate with fed marshals, arrest the driver, and impound the rig,” which is traveling without a permit.
Other native activists have sent messages of solidarity to the Nez Perce, including members of the Tohono O'odham, Dine, and Mohawk. There is another blockade planned for this evening.
For tonight's protest:
Meet to carpool at either 5 pm or 6 pm PDT tonight, August 8, from the sidewalk in front of the Friends of the Clearwater office in Moscow (116 East Second Street) to the Clearwater Valley. Idaho Rivers United, Friends of the Clearwater, and Fighting Goliath are hosting a Middle Fork Clearwater Wild and Scenic River rally at 7 pm PDT, converging at 5695 Highway 12, where participants can preferably park closely together, either along or diagonally on the driveway at Highway 12 milepost 77.4, instead of in more visible, nearby highway turnouts. Tribal and allied resistance will gather in the general vicinity of the evaporator parked in the private lot of Terry and Becky Jackson, who lift the milepost 83 tram cable for megaload passage and who erected the roadside sign stating “Megaloads Keep Idaho Green $$$.” The tar sands module, which will desecrate indigenous lives, rights, waters, and lands at its destination, now occupies the traditional Nez Perce homeland, the wild and scenic river corridor, and the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest.”

TOKYO — Toyota Motor Corp. plans to unveil a "sports car" line that likely will be the Toyota-brand equivalent of Lexus' high-performance F series.
It is unclear whether the new products will be offered outside Japan.
Toyota plans to announce what it calls a "new sports car series" at an event next month here. That unveiling is geared toward Japan, and a company spokesperson declined to offer more details about the event or products.
Toyota offers a Toyota Racing Development performance line under its Toyota brand in North America.
The move comes as Toyota tries to develop a reputation for cars that are emotional and aspirational, rather than simply reliable and utilitarian.
A new line of sports cars also arrives ahead of an expected successor to the Toyota Supra, one of the brand's most storied sports cars. That two-door coupe could debut as early as next year.
This month, Toyota reorganized development of sports cars under the Gazoo Racing Co., an internal unit dedicated to global motorsports.
Earlier in the year, Toyota said it would strengthen its lineup of GRMN offerings, which are specially tuned sporty editions of Toyota-brand production cars.
GRMN originally stood for Gazoo Racing tuned by the Meister of Nurburgring, an homage to Toyota Motor Corp.'s long-standing participation in grueling 24-hour German endurance race.
This year at the Geneva auto show, Toyota introduced a supercharged GRMN version of its Yaris subcompact as its entry into the hot hatch segment.
French protesters
LONDON—Half a million jobs will be lost. More than $130 billion in public spending will be cut. Payments of all kinds—to university students, to inhabitants of public housing, to the BBC—will be chopped, blocked, or frozen. Thus did Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne usher in what has been called “a sober decade” in Britain while the nation listened in stony silence.
Meanwhile, across the Channel, the French were loudly on strike. Or perhaps I should be more specific: The French remained on strike, having already been on strike for more than a week, blocking airports, trains, and refineries; shutting down everything from gas stations to colleges to schools. Thus did the French react to what their president, Nicolas Sarkozy, has called a “difficult, complex” decision to raise the national retirement age from 60 to 62 and the full state pension age from 65 to 67.
And thus did everyone, amazingly, conform to national stereotypes. In an age of supposed globalization, when we are all allegedly becoming more alike—listening to the same American music, buying the same Chinese products—it is astonishing how absolutely British the British remain, and how thoroughly French are the French. Both countries are facing the need to change state spending patterns and cut budgets in order to cope with economic crisis. Faced with this challenge, the British have stiffened their upper lips—while the French have taken to the streets.
There were, it is true, some Brits behaving as if they were French, and vice versa. Following Osborne's budget speech, protesters did gather outside Downing Street in London. They looked suspiciously fringe, however, and many were waving signs advertising the Socialist Worker, a newspaper nobody reads. In France, meanwhile, polls indicate that some 70 percent of the French support the strikes, but fully 18 percent actively oppose them. One brave Frenchman even told a journalist that they agreed completely with President Sarkozy's pension reform. “We shouldn't think it's still acceptable to stop working at 60 years old—we should work until 65.”
Most people did conform to the stereotype, however—so much so that an explanation is surely necessary. National character is not genetic, after all. Yet here are two nations acting like living caricatures of themselves.
Part of the answer lies in historical experience. As I wrote a few weeks ago, the British, unlike Americans, have positive memories of wartime austerity and even rationing. More recently, Margaret Thatcher's 1981 budget cuts heralded real reforms in Britain and, eventually, a period of growth and prosperity. It is not unreasonable to imagine that these cuts will do the same. The French fondness for strikes is based on real experience, too. Strikes, riots, and street demonstrations led to real political changes, not only in 1789 but in 1871, 1958, and many other times, as well. Although they started over what seemed like trivial issues, the famous strikes of 1968 heralded real reforms in France and, eventually, a period of growth and prosperity.
There is an explanation to be found in current politics as well. For most of the last year, scandal has dominated the French media: Ministers who spend government money on expensive cigars and private jets, rich widows who misplace their Picassos and hide their money in tax shelters, accountants who stuff envelopes with cash for bribes. With politicians behaving like so many Marie Antoinettes, is it any wonder the voters object to being told they must now work harder?
By contrast, the British budget cuts are being carried out by a recently elected government, one that hasn't been in office long enough to be caught up in financial scandal. More important, it's a coalition, made up of both Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, two parties with very different voter bases. Conservative conservatives don't like everything about this arrangement, and neither do liberal Liberal Democrats. But the pool of people whose sympathies lie one way or another is much broader, and thus the number of people who will accept budget cuts—however resentfully—is broader, too.
Naturally, this doesn't mean the British reforms will succeed: Angry British voters might still chuck their ruling coalition out of office. Naturally, sullen French strikers might accept change as inevitable and go home. The counterrevolution has triumphed before in France, just as reforming governments have been chucked out in Britain. But until then—plus ça change. And every unhappy nation will go on being unhappy in its own way.

In the days and weeks following the public disclosure of the OpenSSL Heartbleed vulnerability in April, security researchers and others wondered aloud whether there were some organizations–perhaps the NSA–that had known about the bug for some time and had been using it for targeted attacks. A definitive answer to that question may never come, but traffic data collected by researchers on several large networks shows no exploit attempts in the months leading up to the public disclosure.
Researchers from the University of Michigan, the University of Illinois, the University of California at Berkeley , Purdue University and the International Computer Science Institute took a comprehensive look at the way that the Heartbleed vulnerability affected the Internet as a whole in the months since it was disclosed in April, focusing mainly on the response by organizations to patch vulnerable servers and revoke certificates. As the scope and effect of the Heartbleed vulnerability set in, security teams scrambled to determine which of their servers were vulnerable to the issue and whether they needed to begin revoking a bunch of SSL certificates, as well. Many of the top sites on the Internet were patched almost immediately after the disclosure, but that didn't extend to the rest of the vulnerable server population.
“We began performing daily 1% scans of the IPv4 address space on April 9, 48 hours after the disclosure. Our first scan found that 11.4% of HTTPS hosts supported the Heartbeat Extension and 5.9% of all HTTPS hosts were vulnerable. Combining these proportions from random sampling with our daily scans of the HTTPS ecosystem (which do not include Heartbleed vulnerability testing), we estimate that 2.0 million HTTPS hosts were vulnerable two days after disclosure,” the researchers said in their paper, “The Matter of Heartbleed”. Heartbleed is a vulnerability in the Heartbeat extension implementation in OpenSSL that could allow either the client or server participating in a connection to read a small portion of the other machine's memory under certain circumstances. That memory could include confidential data, such as portions of a private key. In addition to looking at initial vulnerability and patching rates, the authors–who include Vern Paxson, J. Alex Halderman, Nicholas Weaver and several others–also researched the attack landscape against Heartbleed before and after the public disclosure of the bug on April 7. Using traffic collected from passive taps at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the International Computer Science Institute and the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, and a honeypot set up on Amazon's EC2 system, they looked at logs for the weeks and months leading up to the disclosure, along with data from the weeks immediately after the announcement. The researchers used a scanner configured to recognize SSL Heartbeat messages.
“LBNL's network spans two /16s, one /20 and one /21. The insti- tute frequently retains extensive packet traces for forensic purposes, and for our purposes had full traces available from February–March 2012, February–March 2013, and January 23–April 30 2014. ICSI uses a /23 networks, for which we had access to 30-days of full traces from April 2014. NERSC has a /16 networks, for which we analyzed traces from February to April 2014. The EC2 honeypot provided full packet traces starting in November 2013,” the paper says. “For all four networks, over these time periods our detector found no evidence of any exploit attempt up through April 7.” “For all four networks, over these time periods our detector found no evidence of any exploit attempt up through April 7, 2014. This provides strong evidence that at least for those time periods, no attacker with prior knowledge of Heartbleed conducted widespread scanning looking for vulnerable servers. Such scanning however could have occurred during other time periods.”
That result also doesn't rule out the possibility that an attacker or attackers may have been doing targeted reconnaissance on specific servers or networks. The researchers also conducted similar monitoring of the four networks, and noticed that the first attempted exploits occurred within 24 hours of the OpenSSL disclosure.

We show 2 methods of installing JProfiler agent and accessing JVM to be profiled from remote location.
JProfiler is an award-winning all-in-one Java profiler and an alternative to jvisualvm. JProfiler's GUI helps you detect performance bottlenecks, memory leaks and resolve threading issues. New features in 7.1 include i.a. JPA/Hibernate probe supporting Hibernate 3.x/4.x, EclipseLink 2.3+ and OpenJPA 2.1+. It is not cheap - comparing to jvisualvm ;) but some of you may have access to it's license e.g. academic one or even qualify for open-source license.
As for remote access you will need a TCP port, login to Java Control Panel and on 'Ports' page determine a port number you are sure is not in use - for example one labelled OPENEJB_ADMIN or ask support for new port assignment for JProfiler exclusively.
Download JProfiler to your home directory and unpack it e.g.
tomcat@host[~]# wget http://download.ej-technologies.com/jprofiler/jprofiler_linux_7_1_2.tar.gz tomcat@host[~]# tar xzf jprofiler_linux_7_1_2.tar.gz
Some of you may prefer to download RPM or shell installer. File locations may differ in that case.
Method 1: Start JProfiler with jpenable
Easier method for Java 1.6 or higher (which is rather typical version these days) but has the drawback that array allocations are not recorded, it means stack trace information for array allocations is not available. If you are profiling frequently you may prefer method 2 though.
tomcat@host[~]# jprofiler7/bin/jpenable Connecting to org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap start [27574] ... Please enter a profiling port [31757] 11002
Download the same tarball to your linux PC (or correct one for you OS), unpack and run jprofiler from bin directory.
Click Session > New Session
Choose 'Attach to profiled JVM (local or remote)'
Enter Host and Profiling Port as previously specified on the server and click OK
Now Session > Open Session
Choose the one just created
Here are some screenshots of running JProfiler.
#### Method 2: Add agentpath to JAVA_OPTS
Stop the JVM (you can use 'jk' shortcut command), add agentpath parameter to your JAVA_OPTS variable in ~/.bashrc and reread the file with 'source ~/.bashrc'.
The library to be loaded is in our case {JProfiler install directory}/bin/linux-x64/libjprofilerti.so.
With jprofiler7 in your home directory and relative path, the example string to be added to JAVA_OPTS may look like
-agentpath:jprofiler7/bin/linux-x64/libjprofilerti.so=port=11002
Or you can use an absolute path to libjprofilerti.so instead. Start JVM with Java Control Panel or js shortcut command. Check logs if you cannot connect.
Note: If you change any JVM/appserver settings in Java Control Panel the agentpath parameter will be removed so you may want to readd it. Alternatively you can ask support to add it to your static parameter set so that it survives JVM/appserver changes.
The JProfiler Manual contains much interesting information on the profiling process, we recommend reading it in full to get most of JProfiler.
North versus south in Batman All the green dots south of Bell Street? They are polling booths won by the Greens. The red to the north are Labor-won booths. The man who made the map for their blog, University of Melbourne academic Michael McCarthy - a professor of biosciences by the way, not a political scientist or urban geographer - says: "You can see the really massive north-south divide. The further south from Bell Street you go, the lower the ALP vote is and the higher for the Greens. North of Bell Street is the opposite. Bell Street is where it turns." The Greens picked up plenty of votes in the electorates of Wills and Batman. Credit:Justin McManus On Twitter, which loves this stuff, the jokes flowed when Professor McCarthy first posted their blog. Bell Street was the 'Tofu Curtain.' The 'Great Wall of Quinoa.' 'The Corduroy Line.' "My wife came up with the best one," they say. "The Hipster-Proof Fence."
Certainly in real estate, properties south of Bell Street are marketed as such, and they cost significantly more on account of proximity to Northcote, Brunswick, Brunswick East and Thornbury, more public transport and more bike tracks. Dr Elizabeth Taylor from the Centre for Urban Research at RMIT says south of Bell Street should take the New York style acronym of SOBS. Certainly some of the house prices for cramped blocks SOBS are enough to make an inner-urban educated cyclist weep. "If a property is north of Bell Street the real estate agents will say it is 'not far' from Bell Street," Dr Taylor says. "People who buy to the south can tend to have status in mind." And they love The Greens. We now have the proof. According to the party's state director Larissa Brown there are several reasons for the huge green vote south of the great divide. Most of the party's 600 volunteers in Batman - The Green Army - live in Brunswick, Thornbury and Northcote.
The Green Army started its campaign of doorknocking for this election in the south, and moved north.
The party had identified growing clusters of potential Greens voters in the more densely populated SOBS. Ms Brown said despite the stark divide shown on the map the Greens still had big swings to them in almost all polling booths north of Bell Street, especially in Reservoir, where party strategists have learned that Greens voters have moved in but only if their house is close to public transport or creeks. "So we would expect any other booths in the north near creeks and trains to keep climbing for us. We will probably doorknock harder in those places in the future."
In the neighbouring seat of Wills, bordered from Batman by the Merri Creek, it's a similar story. Slightly less stark, but similar. It shows a green march north, but also more red presence to the south. North versus south in Wills ​ So what does this all mean? Gentrification. The same old story. Younger, wealthier people who are university-educated and work in well-paid professions are continuing their march north. It started in Fitzroy many moons ago, then north through North Fitzroy, Clifton Hill, Northcote then Brunswick and Thornbury and now into Coburg, Preston, Reservoir and beyond. It is now affecting voting patterns with the Greens on the rise and the Liberal coalition on the slide. Political experts forecast that electoratal boundaries in the inner-north could well be shifted soon to reflect changing demographics.
In the 2011 census, Thornbury West - which is SOBS - had 39 per cent of residents with university qualifications. Dr Taylor expect's this year's census to show an increase in the same area to more than half. The local 'amenity' south of Bell is seen to be better, with the neighbourhoods to the north built post-war, with less strip shopping and more reliance on cars. Median house prices are sitting at around $1million in Northcote this month, and about $650,000 in Reservoir.
Tesla is expanding its retail footprint in Colorado, with two new showrooms set to open next week in Vail and Aspen.
The electric carmaker, which already has a store at Park Meadows in Lone Tree, typically targets high foot-traffic areas for its showrooms, which look more like retail boutiques than car dealerships.
Both the Aspen and Vail showrooms will be located in high-end shopping and dining areas. The Aspen location is at 422 E. Cooper St. in the heart of downtown. The Vail store is in the Solaris development at 141 E. Meadow Drive in Vail Village.
Both are slated to open the week of Dec. 19, a Tesla spokesperson said.
The spokesperson said opening the new stores before the holidays, when both towns are filled with tourists, represents a great opportunity.
Tesla currently sells two models, a sedan starting around $68,000 and a crossover SUV that starts around $85,500.
Earlier this year, the automaker received more than 325,000 reservations in a matter of days for its first “affordable model,” the $35,000 Model 3 set to begin delivering in late 2017. Many of those came from fans who lined up outside Tesla showrooms around the world before CEO Elon Musk even unveiled the vehicle.
Updated Dec. 16, 2016, at 12:48 p.m. This story has been updated to remove the name of Tesla's spokesperson.
Share. This hellish shooter delivers on the single-player front. This hellish shooter delivers on the single-player front.
At its best, Doom is everything it should be: a single-player campaign that's just you, your super shotgun, and barely the amount of ammunition required to kill every single demon on Mars. It feels like a Doom game as you desperately try to find health pickups to keep you going, an ever-growing menagerie of demons snapping at your heels. It's exhausting and exciting and a little bit dumb, and when you're into it you're all the way in. At its worst, Doom is a repetitive series of enclosed rooms filled with demons, all of which you must kill to advance, complemented by a derivative and poorly thought-out multiplayer mode.
First impressions wise, Doom strikes all the right notes. The Union Aerospace Corporation's research facility on Mars runs red with the blood of employees who've learned a new meaning for the phrase 'wrongful termination,' but that barely matters to the inexplicably mute Doomguy, who shoots anything and everything which moves. Starting with only the pistol encourages you to focus on the diabolically delightful Glory Kill system — shoot your nearest Demon enough that they become staggered and highlighted in blue or orange, and if you press F (or R3 on a PS4 controller) while standing next to them you will rend them asunder. That is to say, you'll tear off their limbs and, in more than a few cases, joyfully beat them with their own appendages.
Exit Theatre Mode
Lifted wholesale from the still-popular Brutal Doom mod for the original Doom, developer id Software smartly uses these executions to maintain momentum as you play. An executed enemy will drop health packs — critical pickups in a game where you don't regenerate your health out of combat. As you make your way through the UAC facility, the purpose of those health packs becomes clear: They allow you to sprint headfirst into combat (Doomguy's default movement speed is a steady run) and kill as many enemies as you can. If you take too much damage, or if you're running low on ammunition, it's easy to recover by staggering demons and performing an execution, which gets some health back and removes a threat without using as much ammo. Executions teleport Doomguy a short distance to their target and render them temporarily invincible while they're carried out, which makes them great for two slightly left-of-centre things — getting a moment's ironic peace in the middle of a firefight, and teleporting yourself loose when you clip through the floor (which happened to me more than a few times).
“ The demon outbreak is a result of the worst business plan of all time.
The demon outbreak on the facility is a result of the worst business plan of all time — to rob Hell of its energy resources — and security precautions see to it that you cannot open most doors if any demons are still alive. These are kill chambers, a relic of an era of shooter design all but gone, designed to contain you and force you into a particular playstyle. Where games with regenerating health reward players who hide and pick off enemies one at a time, Doom instead forces you to map out a path through the chamber trying to find health without ever stopping long enough to become overwhelmed.
It's a design philosophy which runs counter to the nature of the execution system. Glory Kills promote a forward momentum, encouraging you to move towards enemies to close the distance and earn your health pickups, but the kill chamber map style does the opposite. Your best strategy is to move backwards through the chamber, away from the enemies, and to do damage as you go. The AI in Doom is not particularly smart, and you can rely on it to roughly converge on your location (even when it can't see you and shouldn't know where you are). So if you run in circles around the kill chamber, shooting behind you and dodging projectiles, you can kill the majority of the enemies within — only after you've thinned the herd of Demons can you then start running forward and killing them by circle-strafing (running around them in circles).
Exit Theatre Mode
It might seem like an odd complaint, because I've praised Doom for how old-school it feels, and circle-strafing in kill chambers is an old-school staple. But in the old days rooms like these were products of an era where enemy AI wasn't capable of the surprisingly scary tactics we see in shooters these days. In Doom it seems more like a crutch — if the enemies were more capable of advanced tactics and teamwork the shooting would be more interesting, and I wouldn't need to be locked in a room to want to kill everything in sight. That doesn't mean it's bad, but it's just about the only trick up Doom's sleeve, and it doesn't take too long before it wears thin.
“ The beautiful finish on the double-barrel gun captures the nostalgic vibe of the older games.
The quality of the shooting itself varies depending on which of the eight weapons you use. The Super Shotgun is brilliant — good enough that by the end of the campaign I was only using other weapons long enough to get shotgun ammo back. The beautiful finish on the double-barrel gun captures the nostalgic vibe of the older games while delivering a hefty wallop across a wide spread, which makes it great against the bigger enemies you end up fighting dozens of. On the other end of the spectrum is the Rocket Launcher, which feels underpowered and redundant. Especially after you've upgraded the Heavy Assault Rifle and the Combat Shotgun to posses explosive alternate fire modes, the Rocket Launcher barely seems worth the effort required to draw it. Weapons sharing ammunition between archetypes – like the Plasma Cannon and Gauss Rifle both using plasmoids – is an odd concession to nostalgia, because you get all the weapons quite early (especially if you're hunting for secret areas). This meant my use of weapons like the Combat Shotgun were relegated to accidental weapon switches, because I was leary of using up my Super Shotgun ammunition on the weaker of the two guns.
Of course, The BFG 9000 makes an appearance and occupies an interesting place in the weapon lineup. Moved away from the weapons wheel, the BFG has its own dedicated button (T or Triangle) which emphasises its importance in your arsenal. When you fire it, it vapourises everything in a very large radius: green ionic charges arc from the first enemy you hit and into every other demon nearby, and the gibs soon fill the air like confetti at an environmentally irresponsible parade. It's a quick-charging Win Button, but that's what the BFG is supposed to be. The only drawback is that it's so powerful, especially if you train your enemies behind you into an easily obliterated mob, that I often found myself holding off on using it, waiting for bigger waves to arrive... until suddenly everything was dead and I didn't get to use it at all.
Exit Theatre Mode
Those hordes of demons come in all shapes and sizes. The enemies start out quite tame, a wide array of lumbering zombie types for you to gib and execute at your leisure. As the campaign progresses the demons start to grow, trading warped humans for bigger, meaner monsters direct from Hell, including the iconic lineup of classics The Pinky demon returns to provide a fantastic fight: your first encounter with this squat, blister-red charging demon is tough, because they close the distance so quickly and shrugs off most shots to the face. Eventually Pinkys will be the cannon fodder you fight as you concentrate on more pressing threats like the cycloptic Mancubus, which has guns for arms and does long-range, mid-range, and short-range damage. The Barons of Hell were my favourite to fight, despite their relative simplicity. Towering demons with horned heads and chitinous armour plating beneath their skin, they rely on close-range attacks and are capable of getting into range very quickly. My one complaint about the monsters is that the possessed grunts which make up the bulk of the cannon fodder sound amateurish. Part gargle, part screaming, their repetitive ambient cries for attention grate on the nerves well before halfway through the campaign.
Rihai Manch, an advocacy group that takes up cases of minority members wrongfully arrested in terror cases has cast doubts on the Lucknow encounter that ended Wednesday morning, and has described it as a tactic by the central government to polarise the last phase of election in UP in the BJP's favour.
It claimed that it had predicted such a scenario ahead of polls to help the BJP. The UP Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) shot dead a suspected militant in an operation that lasted nearly 12 hours on the outskirts of Lucknow early Wednesday.
Rihai Manch's general secretary Rajeev Yadav said in a statement that the entire story leading to this action was riddled with loopholes, making it a case of political gain.
A similar attempt was made in Sambhal in the first phase of election but the Jat voters punctured the plan, said Yadav. “Such a questionable action on eve of election shows the desperation on part of the Modi government,” they said.
Manch which claims it is engaged in political mobilization against wrongful Muslim youths, has been fighting cases across the country on behalf of those it believes have been wrongfully arrested in terror cases. It came into existence after the Batla House encounter in Delhi in September 2008.
Yadav pointed out the blast in the Bhopal-Ujjain passenger train Tuesday morning that set off the chain of events leading to the Lucknow encounter, was attributed to a tubelight blowout in one of the compartments. Passengers spoke about it on camera, so did SP GRP Krishna Veni who initially said that the blast was caused due to an electrical short circuit.
But the narrative changed after the Madhya Pradesh home minister Bhupendra Singh described the blast a terror strike.
Similarly, UP police were at pains to answer some straight question, said Yadav. “The police has maintained it tried for surrender of youth holed up in the house, they even made their uncle to talk to them over phone,” they said.
But no one is explaining how did the police know the name of terror suspect and where did it get the phone number of their uncle as well that of Saifullah who was killed in the action.
Some reports say the police made the gunman Saifullah speak to their brother who implored them to surrender.
They said the Manch had predicted that the security agencies would stage something like this to improve political fortunes of the BJP in this election. Before the sixth phase of polling the agencies were creating an atmosphere claiming the Prime Minister could be attacked. In the run up to the first phase of polling, a team of the special cell of Delhi police stayed in Sambhal to arrest Mohammad Usman following arrest of two persons in Gujarat.
The Madhya Pradesh police had zeroed in on four men from CCTV footage at Bhopal railway station. They were picked up from Pipariya in Hoshangabad district earlier.
These men are from Aligarh and Kanpur in UP.

Continuous Delivery with Symfony + CircleCI + Capistrano
Tom Newby Blocked Unblock Follow Feb 7, 2016
I'm a big fan of continuous delivery — if you've got something ready to release (i.e. you've accepted the pull request) then the best time to deploy is right now.
I hadn't been able to find a whole lot about actually implementing continuous delivery with Symfony, so I've pieced one together for PiggyBike and figured I'd share it with others.
PiggyBike is a fairly straightforward Symfony app for now. It runs on a single DigitalOcean instance provisioned with PuPHPet, with PHP7, nginx, MySQL and Redis. So far, I've been deploying using Capifony, a collection of recipes for deploying Symfony apps with Capistrano. I've used it a lot in the past, and while there's more preferable ways to deploy (blue/green builds with containers etc.), given the single instance nature of this application, it's incredibly reliable.
To orchestrate the whole operation of CI/CD, I've opted to utilise CircleCI. After weighing up the values of their competitors, I settled on CircleCI as I found the config flexible and easy enough (I do love me a good YAML config).
So, here's my circle.yml:
machine:
php:
version: 7.0.0RC7
ruby:
version: 2.0.0-p481
dependencies:
pre:
- cp $HOME/$CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME/app/config/parameters.yaml.circle.dist $HOME/$CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME/app/config/parameters.yml
post:
- rvm use 2.0.0-p481 do gem install psych
- gem install capifony
test:
override:
- SYMFONY_DEPRECATIONS_HELPER="weak" phpunit -c app/
deployment:
production:
branch: production
commands:
- cap -S revision=$CIRCLE_SHA1 deploy
Out of the box, CircleCI is pretty intelligent at learning what you do, but often projects will have some nuances. Here are mine!
Setting up the testing machine
I configured the machine for PHP7 and manually specified the Ruby version, for Capifony. To be able to run the tests, I need to actually create a test instance of the app, so I need to be able to utilise a database. Luckily, CircleCI already provides one (user: ubuntu, name: circle_test, no password), so I create a parameters.yml.circle.dist in my app/config directory so that I can copy this to parameters.yml before composer install has run. Here's a cut of my parameters.yml.circle.dist:
parameters:
database_host: 127.0.0.1
database_port: ~
database_name: circle_test
database_user: ubuntu
database_password: ~
...
After the dependencies have been resolved (this involves installing PHP, Ruby etc.) I had to manually install the psych Rubygem, as I was getting some issues installing Capifony. I'm not really a Ruby user at all, so I have no idea what the problem really was, but that fixed it.
Running the tests
Running the tests is pretty easy — CircleCI preinstalls PHPUnit so it's available on your $PATH. However you'll probably run into the issue where the PHPUnit Bridge module from Symfony converts deprecation notices into big red flags in PHPUnit which causes it to exit with a non-zero exit code, which breaks the build.
This is an awesome feature, especially if you're starting a new project that you want to prevent any deprecated calls making into production — but in my opinion, it doesn't exactly break the build. Luckily you can pass the environment variable SYMFONY_DEPRECATIONS_HELPER set to “weak” which will still report the warnings, but prevent PHPUnit from throwing a non-zero exit code, which will allow your build to progress to the next stage, deployment!
Deploying with CircleCI + Capistrano
I wanted to setup automated deployments on a single branch “production” so that I could just merge master into this branch when I'm ready to deploy (usually a few times per night).
CircleCI lets you achieve this with the YML file by specifying different deploy strategies per branch — you could configure this to deploy master to a staging environment on every push if you wanted.
deployment:
production:
branch: production
commands:
- cap -S revision=$CIRCLE_SHA1 deploy
The commands key allows you to specify a list of command to invoke your deployment, so it's really powerful to modify it how you want — but I just want to run cap deploy.
The default behaviour of cap deploy is to simply check out the latest branch you specify in your deploy.rb. There is however an option to pass in a specific Git hash to be deployed and there is a swathe of environment variables available inside the CircleCI container — you can see them all in the docs.
You'll need to make sure your deploy.rb is configured properly to be able to connect to the remote server, which will involve you adding an SSH keypair for the CircleCI container. I did this by jumping into the container via SSH (there's a “Restart with SSH” option) and running ssh-keygen and adding it to the “SSH Permissions” section of the Project Settings.
How scary are your jack-o'-lanterns? Scarier than you think, according to the Energy Department, which claims the holiday squash is responsible for unleashing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
Most of the 1.3 billion pounds of pumpkins produced in the U.S. end up in the trash, says the Energy Department's website, becoming part of the “more than 254 million tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) produced in the United States every year.”
Municipal solid waste decomposes into methane, “a harmful greenhouse gas that plays a part in climate change, with more than 20 times the warming effect of carbon dioxide,” Energy says.
What's a Halloween-loving pumpkin carver to do?
Turn that pumpkin in to … energy?
Municipal solid waste can be used to harness bioenergy, the Energy Department says, which can help the U.S. become less dependent on carbon-based fuels while limiting stress on landfills by reducing waste. The agency has partnered with industry to develop and test two integrated biorefineries — “facilities capable of efficiently converting plant and waste material into affordable biofuels, biopower and other products.”
Neither of these proposed facilities is operational yet, but someday, all that squishy, orange squash could become clean, green energy.
Until then, happy carving!

SLOVENIA pledged on Thursday to sell 15 state firms including its second largest bank, the biggest telecoms operator and national airline under a crisis package to avert an international bailout.
SLOVENIA pledged on Thursday to sell 15 state firms including its second largest bank, the biggest telecoms operator and national airline under a crisis package to avert an international bailout.
Prime Minister Alenka Bratusek said value added tax would rise from 20pc to 22pc from July 1 but that the government was still in talks with unions on planned cuts to they public sector wage bill.
They said the budget deficit would soar to 7.8pc of national output this year and that the government aimed to bring it down to 3.3pc in 2014.
"This programme will enable Slovenia to remain a completely sovereign state," Bratusek told a news conference.
Finance Minister Uros Cufer said the government would initiate the sale of 15 state firms, including No. 2 state lender Nova KBM , the largest telecoms operator, Telekom Slovenia, flag carrier Adria Airways and Ljubljana Airport.
They said the state would not retain any blocking stake in the companies, and that the package would result in total savings of around €1bn in spending cuts and revenues.
"Slovenia is a plane losing altitude and we first have to stabilise that altitude," Cufer said.
The former Yugoslav republic is racing to raise funds to stay solvent and heal its ailing banking sector, which has seen bad loans soar to €7bn after demand for the country's exports plummeted with the onset of the global crisis.
The crisis has exposed widespread cronyism and corruption in an economy still 50pc controlled by the state.
Slovenia's European Union partners have been pressing Ljubljana to slash state control over the economy and the bloated public sector. But Bratusek's coalition government has struggled to chart a united policy, and faces a backlash from unions. It was unclear whether the measures would be enough to satisfy the EU.
The country bought some breathing space last week when it managed to issue two bonds with a total value of $3.5bn, but will have to tap markets again no later than the first quarter of 2014 before a 5-year €1.5bn bond matures on April 2.
The government decided against a new, progressive "crisis tax" on wages, saying the VAT increase alone would bring in €250m per year.
But Bratusek said the government needed to agree with unions to cut public sector spending by €250m-€300m to avoid having to introduce the crisis tax on wages next year.

CLEVELAND, Ohio - When the lights go out and the acoustic guitar chords blare from the speakers, Bray Wyatt tends to zone out.
"It's not an entrance in my mind. It's sharing a feeling," says Wyatt. "When you walk out, it has its own aura. It's a once in a lifetime experience where the fireflies come out in an arena."
In fact, Wyatt's entrance is even a highlight of WWE's new 2K15 video game:
Local wrestling fans will experience Wyatt's entrance firsthand during Saturday's WWE Live event at The Q. Wyatt and teammate Braun Strowman are tentatively scheduled to take on Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose.
Saturday is just a small part of what's been a huge year for one of WWE's top heels. The 28-year-old Wyatt overcame an injury this past April to take on WWE legend The Undertaker at WrestleMania 31.
Wyatt has spent the past few months feuding with WWE's poster boy Reigns, which led to an epic Wyatt Family victory at the recent Night of Champions pay-per-view, which included a surprise appearance by longtime Wyatt nemesis Chris Jericho.
"I was ready for Jericho," Wyatt says of the pay-per-view's biggest surprise. "He is a familiar foe.  They are a legend and icon in their own right. Unfortunately I knew that we were invulnerable right now."
Wyatt's journey to the upper ranks of the WWE has been a lifelong one, as a third generation superstar. Their grandfather is WWE legend Blackjack Mulligan, father former WWE/WCW star Mike Rotunda and uncle WCW legend Barry Windham (Wyatt's brother is also WWE superstar Bo Dallas).
Wyatt first entered the WWE spotlight when they were introduced as Husky Harris, a member of the young talent stable known as The Nexus. But Wyatt's career didn't really take off until they were rebranded as a backwoods prophet.
Fans may see Wyatt's conflict with Ambrose and Reigns as a recent development. But Wyatt points out the group of superstars has been battling each other since their days at WWE's developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling.
"When you look at me, Ambrose, Harper and Reigns, we've been doing this for years and years," Wyatt says. "Since fighting and having great matches in front of 10 people to us locking horns with The Shield. It's kind of like the Hatfields and the McCoys."
The drama between the Wyatt family and Reigns and Ambrose, which now includes Randy Orton, doesn't show signs of ending soon. There's also speculation that more wrestlers, including former Wyatt Family member Erick Rowan, could jump into the fray, something the Wyatt leader hasn't ruled out.
"We are millions you know," proclaims Wyatt, who adds that their WWE character isn't just an in-ring persona. "At the drop of the hat there's another and another and another. At the end of the day, wins and losses are meaningless. It's not about one single battle. It's about the entire journey."
Last month I hosted Ember NYC's project night, and the audience and I built a sticky chatbox component together. My goal wasn't to end up with a prefabricated solution for everyone to use; instead, I wanted to work through the problem as a group, discussing our thought process and opinions as we went along.
I built this component last summer as part of a client prototype and found it an interesting and fun challenge. It looks like this:
Normally, when a scrollable <div> gets new content, its scrollbar is unaffected. You can see on the left that to keep reading, the user must scroll the chatbox each time a new message comes in.
The sticky chatbox on the right is different. When the user is scrolled to the bottom, new messages appear and "push" the chat log up, so the user doesn't have to keep scrolling. But, if the user scrolls back up to read through older messages, the chat box doesn't snap to the bottom. The scrollbar stays in place, so the user isn't interrupted while reading through the log. This is the behavior found in most modern chat apps like Slack and Twitch.
My approach
When writing complex components, I like to start by identifying the various states in which the component can exist. Identifying state can be tricky; sometimes I find it helpful to try to explain how the interface should behave as if I were talking to a non-technical business or product person. How might we talk about this component together?
When the user is scrolled to the bottom, new messages should show up. If they scroll up to read old messages, the chat should stay still.
From this plain-English description, the states of the component jump out at us:
The user is scrolled to the bottom The user is not scrolled to the bottom
Of course, we can think of other states in which the component could exist -- for example, if the user was scrolled to the top -- but those states aren't relevant here, since they don't affect behavior. The only states that affect behavior are the two we've listed.
Given these possible states, I gave my component an isScrolledToBottom boolean property that I could use to adjust the component's scrolling behavior. I then needed to update this property every time the state of the component changed.
How might I achieve this? The first thing that came to mind was an addon I had used in previous projects: DockYard's Ember In Viewport. This addon lets you render a component to the screen that fires an action whenever that component enters or exits the viewport.
Sounds like just what I needed. If I rendered this component at the end of the chat list, I'd then be able to know whenever the user reached the bottom, and set the state accordingly. If they started scrolling up to read old messages, the component would leave the viewport, and I'd be able to use another action to update the state.
So, I wrote a simple {{in-viewport}} component using the mixin from the addon. You can see the full implementation of that component in the Twiddle below. I then used it in my component's template:
< ul > {{# each messages as |message|}} < li > {{message.text}} </ li > {{/ each }} {{ in -viewport did-enter=( action (mut isScrolledToBottom) true) did-exit=( action (mut isScrolledToBottom) false)}} </ ul >
All that remained was to write the component's behavior. If the user was scrolled to the bottom, the component's <ul> should scroll down each time a new message was rendered. The scrolling should happen after the new message was appended to the DOM — sounds like a perfect use case for the didRender hook:
import Ember from 'ember' ; export default Ember.Component.extend({ didRender() { this ._super(...arguments); if ( this .get( 'isScrolledToBottom' )) { this .$( 'ul' )[ 0 ].scrollTop = this .$( 'ul' )[ 0 ].scrollHeight; } } });
Et voilà! Our chat box lets the user read through the backlog, and then autoscrolls when they're all caught up.
Check out this Twiddle for a full working example: https://ember-twiddle.com/92b9e154ed4b8dc554727bf794da88f6?openFiles=templates.components.chat-box.hbs%2C
The group's approach
To my delight, several members of the group from the project night suggested a completely different strategy. The idea was simple: check the state of the scrollbar the moment a new message arrives. If the scrollbar was at the bottom, autoscroll the chatbox; otherwise, leave it alone.
We still needed to store the state of the scrollbar, so we kept the isScrolledToBottom property; but now, we needed to set this property whenever the component was about to re-render.
It took a bit of experimentation. We started out by trying to calculate the scroll position at the beginning of the didRender hook. The problem here is that in didRender , the chatbox had already been updated -- so even if the user had been scrolled to the bottom, the fact that the new message had already been appended meant they no longer were.
Eventually we realized that we needed to calculate the scroll position just before the new message was added to the DOM. We pulled up the guides for a component's re-render lifecycle hooks:
Both willUpdate and willRender seemed like good candidates. Looking at the documentation for each, we found that willRender is called on both initial render and re-renders, while willUpdate is only called on re-renders. Since we only cared about new messages, we went with willUpdate .
After a little more experimentation, we were able to write a formula to calculate the state of the scrollbar. We then used this formula to set the component's state in willUpdate :
import Ember from 'ember' ; export default Ember.Component.extend({ willUpdate() { this ._super(...arguments); let box = this .$( 'ul' )[ 0 ]; let isScrolledToBottom = box.scrollTop + box.clientHeight === box.scrollHeight; this .set( 'isScrolledToBottom' , isScrolledToBottom); }, didRender() { this ._super(...arguments); if ( this .get( 'isScrolledToBottom' )) { this .$( 'ul' )[ 0 ].scrollTop = this .$( 'ul' )[ 0 ].scrollHeight; } } });
Now the state would be correct even after the new messages were appended, so the code in didRender worked just as before. Cool!
Here's the Twiddle: https://ember-twiddle.com/bfca7855e100560b62651f0cb7673963?openFiles=components.chat-box.js%2C
Tradeoffs
After going through both solutions, Luke Melia pointed out that spying on scroll behavior is quite expensive (which is why the Ember In Viewport addon makes you explicitly opt-in to this behavior). They said that using the first approach could significantly affect performance, especially on mobile. In many cases, then, the willUpdate solution would be the superior choice.
For our demo app, the willUpdate solution was sufficient — the only time we used the isScrolledToBottom property was when re-rendering the list. If you open the Twiddle, however, you'll notice that the state of our component can "lie":
If you scroll the chatbox after a new message has been rendered, you'll notice that the isScrolledToBottom property won't change right away; in fact, it won't update to reflect the "true" state of the scrollbar until the next message arrives.
If we were to add additional behavior to this component that relied on isScrolledToBottom being accurate, we could run into some issues. How might this happen? You could imagine updating the interface to show an indicator that new messages had arrived. You'd want that indicator to clear once the user had read through all the messages. In this case, there could be a long time between when the user had caught up and when the next message arrived, so the interface could fall "out of sync" with the actual state of the user's behavior.
This is just one example of something that could affect your decision. Different approaches often favor competing goals, like performance versus accuracy. It's up to you to decide which strategy is most appropriate based on the unique priorities and needs of your application.
Conclusion
Building the sticky chatbox as a group helped us all see the problem with a bit more clarity. We learned:
Spying on viewport scrolling is expensive, and should only be done when necessary.
The willRender and willUpdate hooks are a great place to take measurements or perform visual calculations on a component's DOM before Ember re-renders it.

Perhaps feeling a bit besieged after dog owner Sean Kendall posted a video of their impassioned confrontation with Salt Lake City police after one of their fellow officers entered their yard and shot their dog, Geist, Police Chief Chris Burbank stepped in front of a camera—and acted pissy that anybody would dare criticize their officers.
"Evidence shows that the dog was extremely close, in fact within feet of the officer," they insisted, immediately after stating that they wouldn't insert themselves into the review of the case.
Well, OK. Let's give them that one. After all, Officer Brett Olsen, the shooter in the incident, had barged into the dog's yard at the time, while searching for a missing child in the neighborhood. They hadn't sought permission, and they apparently made no effort to back out. But they were there.
Then Burbank went on to refer to Olsen as a "seasoned officer" and a "hero" of the Trolley Square mall shooting before getting pissy about the public's angry response to the shooting of Geist. They read infuriated letters suggesting that Olsen deserved the same as he'd inflicted on Geist, and then went on to berate the public at large.
"It is extremely disappointing. This police department has worked tirelessly to ensure that the process that exists within our city for people to protest, for people to bring forth issues, for people to address problems and concerns with the police department, that avenues exist that we can move together and resolve problems...
Individuals will be held accountable for their actions as they always are. Not held accountable to this ridiculousness."
They went on to demand, well, that people respect their officers' authoritah.
"I ask only one thing, and that is that this community continues to approach interactions with the police department in a respectful manner."
Maybe this world just isn't good enough for you and your officers, Chief Burbank.
The chief's resentment at public criticism didn't seem to to take with those outraged by Geist's shooting. Yesterday, organized by Justice for Geist, somewhere between hundreds and thousands of protesters rallied outside the Salt Lake City Police Department to demand that Olsen be fired.
The Salt Lake City council also, rather gently, urged the police department to work with the Humane Society and consider less-lethal means of dealing with family pets. Even implied criticism of that sort toward the state's enforcers is rare from politicians.
Burbank did get one thing right when they marveled, "after 23 years in law enforcement, I haven't seen this sort of public outcry when certain human beings have lost their lives."
Militarized, aggressive and abusive policing is not a new thing, and innocent humans are often the victims, not dogs. But maybe animals that can't speak for themselves more easily evoke sympathy than men, women, and children.
Below, Sean Kendall confront police after learning of the shooting.
But that won't be happening. Prime Minister Bill English told The AM Show on Monday it was just "Twittersphere outrage" and no one in the disabilities community would have taken offence.
"Those people who would be following Nicky Wagner related to their disability functions probably took it as Nicky's kind of humour, I don't know," Mr English said.
Asked if they had confidence in their ability to do the job - considering many on Twitter pointed out because of their disabilities, they are unable to enjoy the kinds of activities that take place on the harbour - Mr English said they did.
"There may be a few people in the Twittersphere who don't, but they don't have confidence in much. But the disability sector does, and I do."
They aren't aware of the controversial tweet until Sunday morning, while they were at the opening of Auckland's Waterview Tunnel.
"The Waterview Tunnel is going to make more difference, and the thousands of people who turned up to that tunnel know that it means more than this little Twittersphere outrage."
Despite the dismissal of this particular incident, Mr English says it's important that politicians realise times have changed.
"As long as you're out of your house, you're on live video - that's how you need to behave. It does require much more discipline than used to be the case with politicians."
Ms Wagner themselves later claimed they meant everyone present would rather have been meeting out on the harbour, than in an office.

SIR – We must harden our hearts. The hundreds of thousands crossing into Europe are but the advance party of an ever-increasing tide.
Europe cannot take any further strain on its existing population: we are already overcrowded and have our own social problems to address.
It would pay even in the medium term to return the migrants across the borders of Europe, establishing humane camps in countries such as Libya and Turkey. Those escaping ethnic cleansing must be granted asylum and given education, training and worthwhile employment, so that if and when peace is established in their countries of origin they can return to build viable economies and decent administrations.
A practical pan-European plan must be formulated and enacted within the next few months.
SIR – In recent weeks there have been horrific stories of immigrants trying to reach England by walking through the Channel Tunnel. Horrific because the chief concern, from the Prime Minister down, is for the inconvenience caused to British holidaymakers.
The language used in the media would suggest the storming of the Bastille, instead of a few thousand desperate people who have trekked from northern Africa in hope of a safe future.
Hospitality is at the core of the Gospel, yet it seems that the churches, like society, have given up.
Rev Andrew Allen
Exeter College, Oxford
SIR – If you take the view that the Calais migrants are asylum seekers fleeing from the harshness and violence of regimes in their own countries, then they are looking for a country where freedom and democracy are paramount.
Given that they are obviously trying to escape from France, it must therefore follow that France is not a safe haven for asylum seekers; or else that the majority of migrants are motivated by the desire to profit from Britain's economy and benefits system.
The biggest shame however lies with France, as a country both rejecting of and rejected by penniless migrants.

SIR – If I were found attempting to break into government property, I would quite rightly be arrested, charged and very possibly punished.
However it seems that if I am successful in my break-in, and only then found on the premises, I can expect to be put up in a hotel, fed on a regular basis, given new clothing and paid a generous weekly sum, all for the foreseeable future.
More than ever, the European Union reveals itself to be incapable in a crisis and totally unsympathetic towards the concerns of its citizens.

SNP's way with words
Nicola Sturgeon meeting with David Cameron back in May (PHOTO: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images)
SIR – The public in general and the Scottish people in particular should be wary of the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon.
 They are reported as saying that “There will only be another referendum [on Scottish secession from the Union] if a majority in Scotland want it, but the reverse of that is also true. If a majority of people do want it, then David Cameron has no right to stand in the way of that happening.” Those two statements are effectively the same, expressed with different emphasis. The opposite of “there will only be another referendum if a majority in Scotland want it” is “there will be another referendum even if only a few Scots want it.”
Stanley Eckersley
Pudsey, West Yorkshire
SIR – Quite apart from David Cameron's right to veto a further referendum, Nicola Sturgeon's assertion that politicians cannot obstruct the wishes of the people is nonsense.
Were their hypothesis correct, hanging would still be in use in Britain, as it has public support in numerous polls. Fortunately we appoint politicians to decide on such matters for the greater good of all our citizenry.

How to make the aerospace industry soar again
SIR – As a proud Briton, it grieves me to hear that our aircraft manufacturers are likely to cease production of the Typhoon fighter in 2018 on account of a failure to win overseas orders.
I also note that Rolls-Royce, our one remaining global player in the aero-engine market, has issued several profits warnings.
Anyone who wishes to read a first-hand account of Britain's postwar decline from global dominance in aviation to a subordinate role in the European aerospace industry could do worse than get hold of a copy of Not Much of an Engineer, by Sir Stanley Hooker. They spent a lifetime working for and alongside Rolls-Royce and played a key role in fixing the technical and leadership problems that were bringing the firm to its knees in 1971.
At the outset, it is a tale of excellent teaching institutions, extraordinary technical brilliance and sustained effort by a dedicated workforce.
Sadly, the book also charts an increasingly dysfunctional relationship between the RAF, politicians and engineering companies, coupled with spells of poor leadership and a lack of technical experience at board level.
This tale has been replicated across many other companies. One cannot help but conclude that there is a deep-seated problem in the way that British industries and successive governments conduct their affairs.
Global markets insist on excellence and value for money. This country needs to look at the structure of the education system if it is to restore an emphasis on achievement that was damaged by the abolition of grammar schools. The Government must also review how it supports companies so that they can compete more effectively on the international stage.

Costly cancer drugs
The Cancer Drugs Fund was set up in 2010 to improve patient access to life-extending drugs (PHOTO: Alamy)
SIR – The recent plea from oncologists against the “de-listing” of a number of drugs from the Cancer Drugs Fund (Letters, July 31) should be treated with caution.
The Cancer Drugs Fund was an initiative set up by the Prime Minister to enable drugs to be prescribed without their having first been reviewed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice). I believe it was unwise to exclude new cancer drugs from this process.
Some of the latest cancer drugs are very expensive. Although they may indeed extend life for short periods, their cost and efficacy should be compared with other new drugs and treatments before being made available for prescription within the NHS.

This was placed here in 1999 by evacuee schoolboys from the Coopers' Company School.

Necessary Lords
SIR – Baroness D'Souza is correct to stress the importance of the House of Lords to British democracy (Comment, August 1). We have an ideal constitution, with a supreme elected body, a wise and ceremonial monarchy and a revising chamber, the Lords.
Rather than an elected chamber of party apparatchiks, we need the collective wisdom provided by the best of our lawyers, medics, clergy, business people and academics, with a few politicians sprinkled into the mix. The Upper House needs a tweak, not radical surgery.

Why British lamb is a winner for country lovers
Out in front: competitors in the Lamb National, Ascot's alternative to the horse race (PHOTO: Samir Hussein/Getty)
SIR – Both the British public and the many millions of tourists who visit our country appreciate the beauty of our landscape, which is the product of centuries of livestock farming.
Countless calendars, boxes of chocolates, biscuit tins and tea towels are sold with just these images in mind.
With the current crisis in lamb prices, it is time to remind people that in order to maintain the scenery, the business of grazing livestock needs to remain economically viable.
We should be making the point that, by buying British lamb, consumers are investing in the landscape – thus putting a spring in their step and some spring lamb in their basket.

The Proms' rescuer
SIR – The coverage of this year's Proms by the BBC is vigorously applauded by Greg Sanderson, who is responsible for it as commissioning editor at the BBC (Letters, July 31).
They would have had nothing to applaud if the Proms had not been rescued from bankruptcy in 1902 by Sir Edgar Speyer, a successful German financier who became a British citizen. This close friend of Asquith donated “many thousands of pounds” for which they were publicly thanked by
Sir Henry Wood. Their generosity was totally forgotten after 1915 when they were hounded out of the country by wartime anti-German hysteria.
Strauss's Till Eulenspiegel was performed at every Prom concert sponsored by Speyer. It is on the programme for the last night of this year's Proms. Would it not be appropriate for Mr Sanderson to commission a tribute in the Royal Albert Hall to this great benefactor on the centenary of their enforced departure from our country?

Parting remarks

The day before they lost consciousness, I told them I thought we should put off the ceremony.
“No”, they said, “get married anyway” – before adding, with a wry smile, “The first 30 years are the worst”.
More than 40 years on, I am very glad that I obeyed their instructions.

Eco Ad specialises in waterless urinals with a bit of a difference. Not only will our urinals prevent blocked pipes, reduce washroom odours, and save thousands of litres of water, they will generate a new revenue stream though the unique advertising space.
This means that your payback period is reduced and your return on investment is increased. In some cases you can expect to see a payback in as little as 6 months. These are no ordinary urinals!
Eco Ad has the sole distribution rights in the UK and Eire for this style of waterless urinal. We take away the hassle of finding advertisers and just leave you with the rewards by paying back a percentage of the advertising and improving the facilities for your customers.
There are over 3.6 million urinals in the UK and each of those urinals are using an average of 100,000 litres of water every year. If we were to swap each of them with our urinals, we would be responsible for saving 360 billion litres of drinking water a year. That's enough water to fill 144,000 Olympic sized swimming pools. Why don't you help us make the first step?
Megyn Kelly, Sebastian Gorka (Credit: Fox News) Megyn Kelly and guest unwittingly prove Trevor Noah and "The Daily Show" to be 100 percent correct Those "political stages of grief"? Fox News is in their thrall
On Tuesday night's edition of "The Daily Show," host Trevor Noah noted that the first stage of grief for a politician requires that one "say what you would have said anyway," and as it's almost as if the producers of "The Kelly File" were taking notes, because last night Dr. Sebastian Gorka appeared on the program to urge Americans to buy more guns.
If it seems impossible to imagine a violent scenario in which the conservative response doesn't entail purchasing more firearms, that's because unless your skin's the wrong color or you follow the wrong faith, there isn't one.

"Your position right now," Kelly began, "is that Paris is just the beginning and that we need to rely on ourselves. What do you mean by that?"
"The message is very clear," they replied. "The jihad is real, the jihad is global, and they want to bring it to the shores of America." As proof, they offer statistics which will be -- but as of this moment, have not yet been -- published in a NY Post article demonstrating that 30 percent of the people arrested in the United States for having ties to ISIS "have no intention of going overseas to fight."
Because of this, Americans can't afford to "wait for Uncle Sam to protect you -- every American has a duty and responsibility to be aware of the threat and be prepared to protect themselves."
"What does that mean?" Kelly asked. "There's no reasoning with these people." They added that when news of the hostage situation in Paris broke on Friday night, they attempted to book a hostage negotiator to discuss it, but "of course, that was ridiculous, there's no negotiating with these people. So how are Americans supposed to protect themselves?"
Gorka's answer -- shockingly -- was that "you need to be tactically aware -- if you're in a state or municipality that allows you to carry a weapon, you should get training and do so."

The happy-clappy start to this month has left investors wondering if it's actually OK to celebrate.
There are warnings, of course, that this market is being stupid and too greedy. “Nobody knows whether we're out of the woods, or if we were ever really in them in the first place,” writes Michael Batnick, over at The Irrelevant Investor.
That's in the wake of yesterday's 349-point leap, which puts the Dow DJIA, -0.13% down just 3.2% for the year. Less than three weeks ago, the blue-chip gauge was showing a drop of 10.1% year to date.
“It is only natural that some kind of bounceback is due,” says Helen Thomas over at Blonde Money. ”Just as we overshoot into panic, we are going to look as if we overshoot into greed.”
Meanwhile, JonesTrading's Michael O'Rourke writes that the market's action yesterday was “nonsensical.” The bearish strategist says that they have “a hard time believing anything about this behavior is healthy.”

The case is especially frustrating to those outside Laos, who say Mr. Vixay appears untouchable as long as they remain in their home country, where, they say, officials have refused to do a thorough investigation despite the reams of evidence presented to them. And without stopping him, wildlife officials and investigators say, they have little hope of breaking down a business empire that they say connects the African savanna to the Asian jungles and ultimately to customers of ivory and traditional medicines in Vietnam and China.
“He is the single largest known illegal wildlife trafficker in Asia,” said Steven Galster, the executive director of Freeland, a counter-trafficking organization that has been trailing Mr. Vixay for eight years. “He runs an aggressive business, sourcing lucrative wild animals and body parts wherever they are easily obtained. Every country with commercially valuable wildlife should beware.”
Freeland has been instrumental in building a case against Mr. Vixay, and was the source of the vast majority of the documents reviewed for this article, including business contracts and Laotian customs documents that attest to the scale of their operations. Founded in Bangkok more than a decade ago, Freeland is staffed by current and former law enforcement officials from Britain, the United States, Thailand and a number of other Asian countries, and is financed partly by the American government.
The nonprofit organization, which works closely with government officials in Africa, Asia and the United States, also provided entree for The New York Times to some of those officials. The Times interviewed authorities from Thailand, China, South Africa, Laos and Vietnam.
The booming trade in exotic wildlife has been fueled by rising wealth in China and Vietnam and the demand there for things like the scales of the pangolin, which are consumed in the unproven belief that they help to lactate mothers.
Mr. Vixay, who is in their 50s, has met this growing demand for animals like snakes, lizards and turtles from their base in the impoverished countryside of Laos, a thinly populated country bordering Vietnam and China and known for its widespread corruption.
For years, the inner workings of their syndicate remained somewhat opaque to the Thai investigators trailing him. But in 2011, for the first time, a part of Mr. Vixay's operations was exposed by the arrest and trial of a Thai man who says they were their deputy, Chumlong Lemtongthai, thousands of miles away in South Africa after an investigation of a rhino-horn smuggling operation.
The “commandant” of the cult group that clashed with police in Mathura's Jawahar Bagh on June 2 has claimed that the squatters were trained in stick-fighting by “a local RSS leader named Rajveer alias Guruji”.
Advertising
Veeresh Yadav, who carried a reward of Rs 15,000 on their head, was arrested by Mathura Police Wednesday along with their wife Lalita Devi and two children. Veeresh, a native of Badaun, claimed themselves to be the “commandant” at the camp where they were in charge of the security. They told police they manned the “12 check posts” inside the camp and it was their duty to ensure “no one gets in or goes out without permission”.
Veeresh spoke of the “RSS leader” as “an important member of the camp” run by Ram Vriksh Yadav, the cult group's leader who was killed in the clash along with 28 other people, including two police officers, during the eviction drive.
“Veeresh Yadav has claimed that one Rajveer Singh of Agra, who has links with the RSS, used to impart training to the inmates of Jawahar Bagh,” SSP Babloo Kumar told reporters in Mathura Wednesday. “We are trying to locate this person (Rajveer) and their alleged RSS links are being investigated,” they added.

The SSP added that Veeresh “used to give shooting training to the members of the camp”. “We are expecting to get the locations of Vivek and Raj Narain, both sons of Ram Vriksh Yadav who too were living in the camp with him.”
Mathura SP (City) Alok Priyardarshi said police will make Rajveer an accused “only after their criminal connections with the camp have been established”.
The RSS has rubbished the claims about one of its members being associated with the camp. The organisation's prachar head (Braj region), Pradeep Kumar said there was “no one by the name of Rajveer” in the RSS.
“Since the members of Samajwadi Party are seem to be involved in this (Jawahar Bagh) issue, Sangh is being dragged into the matter,” they said.
Veeresh is the third most important member of the cult group, after Rakesh Gupta (financer) and Chandan Bose (the second-in-command), to have been arrested.
The SSP said some of Veeresh's statements corroborated those of Chandan. Veeresh has told police that Ram Vriksh had set up 12 check posts at the camp and these were manned by 200 volunteers who worked on six-hour shifts. After the police started carrying out reconnaissance of the 270-acre government plot that the group had been encroaching upon for over two years, the strength of these check posts was increased from 200 to 300 volunteers, added the SSP.
Besides, Ram Vriksh had appointed ‘darogas' (inspectors) for patrolling and there were 19 squads each with a strength of 15-20 young boys who were “great fighters”, the official said. Veeresh told police during interrogation that Ram Vriksh collected jewellery from the women and cash from the men in the name of Baba Jai Gurudev. The cash and jewellery were kept with a person known as ‘Doctor' who hailed from Hardoi, Kumar said, and added that “another Doctor Upen” was in charge of medical requirements of the squatters.

Ram Vriksh's charred body was identified by their lawyer Tarani Kumar Gautam who demanded that it be handed over to their daughter who resided in Delhi. The police, though, had refused to hand over the body to the woman, identified as Gudiya. Veeresh has told police that Gudiya “was not Ram Vriksh's biological daughter but was treated like a daughter”, SSP Kumar said.

In what started as an attempt to answer a question put to me by CMS/W head Ed Schiappa — “Who has MIT hosted as writers-in-residence over the years?” (turns out Michael Crichton was one of many great ones) — I've ended up creating the first one-stop searchable collection of every MIT President's Report…
…all 57,000 pages of them, going back to 1872. It's worth noting that each of these documents have been in separate searchable PDFs and HTML files, but this is the first time they have been aggregated into a single document — one needn't run nearly 140 separate searches for the same term. That's especially important for reports after 2003, which had their sections broken out into dozens of separate PDFs.
Two 1.5GB files are now available for download:
A single PDF, with the first page of each report as bookmarks
A .zip file of each year's individual report
Background
Every summer (roughly), MIT units are asked to write up their activities from the previous year, what ultimately becomes the “President's Report”: http://web.mit.edu/annualreports. I scraped the files from the Annual Reports site and combined the reports into a single document, making a way to search for terms across the entire corpus back to 1872.
Check it out. Reading a unit's portion in the reports over time gives some fascinating insights into its — and the Institute's — evolution. You see MIT's realtime role in World War II, the mounting pressure for gender equality, its modernization of fundraising methods, and — in what's huge this year — the nitty gritty of its move 100 years ago from Boston to Cambridge.
Viz.:
The word nuclear maps to the rise of German nuclear research in the 1930's, but formal funding (and a Ph.D. program) for nuclear research starts in 1942 — the year America launched the Manhattan Project. An institutional concern with gender (that word specifically) first appears in 1978, in response to University of California v. Bakke, the Supreme Court decision upholding affirmative action. Yet it's not until the '80s that a department — the MIT Department of Architecture — appears to be the first to go a step further, stating explicitly that lack of gender and racial diversity is hurting the quality of its instruction. (I'm curious to hear if, as one might assume, there's documentation of this concern prior to the '80s outside the President's Reports, perhaps in The Tech's archives.) The first endowment fundraising campaign did really, really well: it brought in $100,116,402 in 2016 dollars. Yet it wasn't until 1968 that MIT decided to fundraise year-round instead of simply through occasional campaigns. The 1912 and 1916 reports show that MIT's move to Cambridge from Boston almost didn't happen, that it depended on securing assistance from the state of Massachusetts in order to receive matching funds from U.S. senator and MIT alum Coleman du Pont to actually purchase the 50 acres from the City of Cambridge. I had to laugh at the line describing the way MIT overcame opposition to the move (emphasis mine): “…numerous petitions [to the City of Cambridge] had been received from prominent businessmen and organizations in Cambridge, not especially interested in education, urging the Institute to go there…”
It's a complete rabbit hole, and if you find yourself with a quiet hour or two, jump in. What do you find?
Variety is reporting that Wisconsin has decided to appeal Brendan Dassey's overturned conviction, meaning the Making A Murderer subject might not go free anytime soon.
In August, a federal magistrate judge granted Dassey a writ of habeas corpus after it determined the actions of their bumbling, self-aggrandizing court-appointed attorney Len Kachinsky were “indefensible.” Wisconsin's Attorney General Brad Schimel said today, though, that they believe that “the magistrate judge's decision that Brendan Dassey's confession was coerced by investigators, and that no reasonable court could have concluded otherwise, is wrong on the facts and wrong on the law.” In other words, just because one judge believes it was sketchy doesn't mean that the average jury would.

The Attorney General's office just filed notice of the appeal in U.S. District Court today, meaning that there is no trial date set just yet. It is worth noting that victim Teresa Halbach's family has been notified of the state's decision and, according to Schimel, “fully support the State's decision to seek justice on behalf of their daughter.”
1 Rinse the cut with water. Running water will both clean the wound and help stop the bleeding. Run cold water over the cut to constrict the blood vessels and stop the bleeding. Doing the same with hot water will cauterize the cut, allowing the blood to clot. Don't use both hot and cold water—just one or the other should do the trick. You can use an ice cube instead of cold water to close off the blood vessels. Hold the ice to the cut for a few seconds until the wound closes up and stops bleeding.

2 Apply pressure to the cut. After you clean the cut, apply pressure to it with a piece of clean tissue paper or gauze. Hold the tissue or gauze in place for several minutes, then check to see if the bleeding has stopped.[1] If blood soaks through the tissue or gauze, replace it with a clean, dry piece. After you clean the cut, apply pressure to it with a piece of clean tissue paper or gauze. Hold the tissue or gauze in place for several minutes, then check to see if the bleeding has stopped.
3 Try a styptic pencil. These waxy pencils were originally made for shaving nicks and razor burn but work great for any small cut. Rub the pencil over your skin and let the mineral astringents it contains go to work. It will sting a bit on contact, but after a few seconds both the pain and bleeding will go away.
4 Add petroleum jelly to encourage clotting. As a result of the waxy texture of petroleum jelly or Vaseline, applying a small smear of it to minor cuts will block off the blood flow outside of the skin and give the wound time to clot.[2] You can use regular lip balm if you don't have any plain petroleum jelly or Vaseline on hand.

5 Rub on some antiperspirant. Similar to a styptic pencil, your deodorant has aluminum chloride which works as an astringent to stop the blood flow. Put some on your finger before smearing it over the cut, or rub the stick directly onto your nick.
6 Dabs on Listerine. Originally created as an aftershave, regular Listerine can disinfect your cut and help stop blood flow. Pour some directly over the cut or dip a cotton ball into the Listerine and dab it on. You should notice a decrease in blood flow after a minute or 2.
7 Use an alum block. This is a soap-like bar created from minerals which help to stop bleeding. Wet the alum block in water and gently rub it over the cut. There is no need to apply pressure as you place the block over your gash; the minerals will do the work themselves.[3] This is a soap-like bar created from minerals which help to stop bleeding.

10 Put some cornstarch on the wound. Sprinkle a bit of cornstarch onto the cut, being careful not to rub it or cause any further abrasions. You can lightly press the powder onto the cut to help expedite the process. When the cut has stopped bleeding, use running water to rinse the cornstarch off.
11 Use spiderwebs, in a pinch. This is a great option if you are cut while hiking or outdoors. Grab some (spider-free!) spiderwebs and place them over the cut, rolling them up if necessary. The webs will stanch the blood flow and give your cut time to clot internally.[5] This is a great option if you are cut while hiking or outdoors.

An Opinion Savvy poll of likely South Carolina voters in next Saturday's Republican Primary there continues to show Donald Trump leading by a relatively wide margin. The poll of likely voters was conducted February 10-11 by phone and mobile devices. The poll was weighted by age, race, gender, evangelical vote, and region. It has a margin of error of 3.5% and 95% confidence level:
The Results:
Trump: 36%
Cruz: 19%
Rubio: 15%
Bush: 11%
Kasich: 9%
Carson: 5%
Undecided: 5%
Analysis by Matt Towery (Sr.) Political Analyst FOX5 Atlanta/columnist and frequent pollster for Morris Newspapers: “The poll conducted by Opinion Savvy (which is owned and managed by Matt Towery, Jr.) is one of the most detailed surveys I have seen conducted in a South Carolina primary. Looking at the various cross tabulations, it is easy to see why Trump has such a strong lead at this point in the race. Trump carries every age group except for the youngest (18-29) where Rubio nudges Trump out by 7 points. But Trump has comfortable leads among the other age groups in the poll. Trump has the highest support from almost every segment of respondents grouped by political philosophy. Trump leads among those describing themselves as “very conservative,” “somewhat conservative,” “moderate” and “somewhat liberal.” John Kasich leads among the few South Carolina GOP voters who describe themselves as “very liberal.”
Nearly 60% of the voters in the GOP primary identify themselves as “evangelical” in the poll. But even among these evangelical voters, Trump leads Cruz by ten points. Of course South Carolina primaries can be very volatile and turnout can greatly impact the final numbers. But it appears Trump has consolidated and expanded upon their lead in South Carolina after New Hampshire in this poll. This is notable given that recent Opinion Savvy surveys of this race in South Carolina have shown Trump in a closer race there than most other surveys.
The battle for second place now appears to be wide open. Cruz would seem to have the best opportunity to finish second but both Rubio and Bush are in contention as well. The poll does seem to indicate that Rubio's post-New Hampshire debate “hangover” may be lifting. Just as in Iowa it would be wise to keep an eye out for last minute rise in their support should they turn in a stronger debate performance this coming week.
Finally, we will keep an eye on the well-known negative “push polls,” mailers, and ads for which the South Carolina contest is famous for producing. My guess is that Trump is at their high “watermark” in this survey and that any failure on their part to have a strong ground game or to not respond to the usual tough campaign tactics in South Carolina will result in a tightening of this race.”

Robotics experts at a recent robot ethics panel held at Berkeley, University of California have suggested that child sex robots could be introduced to help rehabilitate paedophiles.
Pop culture has long theorised that robots could be used for a variety of purposes, such as being a home butler like Rosie in The Jetsons or Andrew in Bicentennial Man; a perfect robot woman like Valerie 23 in The Outer Limits; or even a robot child for people who cannot have children of their own like David in A.I. Artificial Intelligence.
The concept of robot sex workers has been bandied about for a while, and a recent poll found that one in six people in the UK would have sex with a robot, but a child sex robot doesn't yet exist.
Humanoid robots
Recently, a Japanese museum launched a new display of incredibly life-like android robots, which included a robot that looked like an adult Japanese woman and a robot newsreader resembling a female child.
"Child-like robots could be used for paedophiles the way methadone is used to treat drug addicts," Ron Arkin, Georgia Tech's Mobile Robot Lab director told the audience, according to Forbes.
"There are no presumptions that this will assuredly yield positive results – I only believe it is worth investigating in a controlled way to possibly provide better protection to society from recidivism in sex offenders. If we can save some children, I think it's a worthwhile project."
Arkin has previously mentioned this concept in the press and says that people who work with sex offenders have already expressed interest to them in researching these robots as a treatment tool.
They fear that if these robots are not researched clinically, a black market could rise up offering child sex bots for sale.
At the moment, laws in the US state that child pornography is illegal, but "virtual child porn", where a child is actually a young-looking adult, is considered legal. In Canada however, child sex dolls are illegal.
Child sex robots inevitable
Sex dolls are legal in the UK, but only when bought by people aged over 18. There is currently no law in place governing child sex dolls, however, and last year a Chinese website sold several child-like sex dolls to customers in the UK, among other countries.
According to Ben Way, the author of Jobocalypse: The End of Human Jobs and How Robots will Replace Them, child sex robots are definitely on their way.
"There is no doubt that child sex bots will become available, and the line and distinction between an adult sex bot and a child sex bot is impossible to police," they told MailOnline.
"Will child sex bots lead to some people acting out their dark and disgusting desires on real children? Yes, but I suspect having child sex bots will significantly reduce the number of people overall who abuse children.
"As repugnant as it may seem society should support this technology and do proper research into its effects before making a snap decision based on social norms, the most important thing we can do as a society is reduce harm to children whatever way we can do it."
In a first-ever experiment, primates move and feel objects on a computer screen using only their thoughts
When real brains operate in the real world, it's a two-way street. Electrical activity in the brain's motor cortex speeds down the spinal column to the part of the body to be moved while tactile sensations from the skin simultaneously zip through the spinal cord and into the brain's somatosensory cortex. Most of us would have trouble doing the former without the latter: Absent the feel of a floor beneath your feet it's awfully difficult to walk properly, and lacking the tactile sensation of a coffee mug, your brain cannot sense how tightly your fingers should grasp it. There have been tremendous advances made in brain–machine interfaces in which electrodes implanted, first in monkey brains and, now, in those of quadriplegics and patients with "locked-in syndrome," translate motor cortex electrical activity into output that moves a prosthetic arm or computer cursor. Until now, however, they have addressed only half of our interaction with the world. A new study offers hope of expanding that capacity.
Scientists led by Miguel Nicolelis, professor of neurobiology at Duke University Medical Center, are reporting the first-ever demonstration in which a primate brain not only moves a "virtual body" (an avatar hand on a computer screen), but also receives electric signals encoding the feel of virtual objects the avatar touches—and does so clearly enough to texturally distinguish the objects. The experiment involved two monkeys. If the technology works in people, it promises to make quite a difference to paralyzed patients. They would not only be able to walk and move their arms and hands, says Nicolelis, but also to feel the texture of objects they hold or touch, and sense the terrain they walk on. "You cannot produce motor behavior without tactile feedback from the environment," they say.
In the study, reported in the October 6 issue of Nature, Nicolelis and their colleagues implanted two sets of electrodes in the monkeys' brains. (Scientific American is part of Nature Publishing Group.) One set sensed the electrical activity of neurons in the motor cortex and translated it into signals that steered an avatar arm on a computer screen. Other electrodes, in the somatosensory cortex, received electrical feedback from the avatar hand. The monkeys were trained to move the avatar arm with their thoughts and touch identical-looking circles on the screen. The touch triggered the transmission of high-frequency electrical signals meant to encode virtually the object's unique texture. The monkeys learned that touching only one of the three objects won them a reward (juice), so they were motivated to put their avatar hand on that one and not the other two. It took one monkey four tries and the other nine to learn how to select the desired object by texture alone. "This is the first time a brain has controlled a virtual arm that touches objects and receives signals that describe the texture of those objects," Nicolelis says.
The field of brain–machine interfaces or "neural prosthetics" has proceeded in fits and starts. The first paralyzed patient received a neural implant in 1996, translating thoughts into words spoken by a computer. A few other victims of accidents, stroke orlocked-in syndrome have had electrodes implanted in their motor cortexes or attached to their scalps to translate electrical activity in the brain into an output that moves a prosthetic arm, computer cursor or other device. But not all of the devices have worked, and some have deteriorated after a few months.
That disappointing record is about to change. At the University of Pittsburgh, for instance, neuroscientists led by Andrew Schwartz have begun recruiting patients paralyzed by spinal cord injury: As with the Duke monkeys, they, too, will be able to "feel" the environment around them thanks to electrodes in the somatosensory cortex that receive information from a robot arm. "This will be essential for manipulating objects," Schwartz says, whose research is independent from Nicolelis's. "Giving a subject the sense of touch...would be a novel advance."
And it is well within reach, Nicolelis says.  They are a founder of the Walk Again Project, an international collaboration whose goal is to develop the first brain–machine interface that will give paralyzed patients full mobility through a "wearable robot." Think: Iron Man, a full-body exoskeleton-like prosthetic, the interface controlled by neural implants that capture signals from the motor cortex to move legs, hands, fingers and everything else as well as be studded with sensors that relay tactile information about the outside world to the somatosensory cortex. Buoyed by the advances so far, Nicolelis predicts that the device will be ready to debut in 2014; their team plans to unveil it at the opening game of soccer's World Cup in Brazil that June. "It's our moon shot," they say.
Will Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have some extra competition? The Libertarian Party's nominee, Gary Johnson, is vying for a spot in the Sept. 26 debate and could end up giving the main two candidates a run for their money. Get to know Gary right here!
1. They put a spin on Donald Trump's campaign slogan.
Instead of agreeing with Donald‘s “Make America great again” tagline, Gary thinks we need to “Make America sane again.” After all the craziness that has surrounded this year's election already, we can't help but agree with Gary's thought!
2. He's already run for president once.
Gary was the Libertarian Party candidate in the 2012 election as well, so he's been through the campaign wringer before. They only received 1 percent of the popular vote, but they still felt the campaign was a “mission accomplished” — and clearly wanted to try again four years later!
3. They used to be part of the Republican Party.
After entering politics in 1994 with the intention of running for governor, Gary was elected as the 29th Governor of New Mexico that same year. They served until 2003. Gary even began their 2012 presidential campaign as a Republican Party member!
4. Their running mate also has political experience.
If elected as president, Gary's vice president would be Bill Weld, a former Governor of Massachusetts who also served two terms like Gary did in New Mexico. They shared a video on their official campaign page explaining just how they're better than “Clintrump”!
5. Donald Trump wants to take Gary on in the Sept. 26 debate.
Gary's poll numbers in August were close to the 15 percent requirement to potentially earn them a spot in the fall Presidential debates. Although they've dwindled a bit since, Donald has threatened that they won't participate in the Sept. 26 election against Hillary Clinton if Gary and Green Party candidate Jill Stein can't participate. If Trump gets their way, this debate could serve as a launching pad for Gary!
HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Gary as a presidential nominee? Do you think they stand a chance against Hillary and Donald? Tell us below!
Krill sharks are the biggest animals on Nea, with 6 to 7 meters in length truly giants and can be found in the Kurnugian sea, the biggest body of water on Nea. Like the name implies these monsters are no threat for humans, with its up to 4 cm long slender teeth they filtrate small swimming crustaceans, small fish and other small animals out of the water.Their ancestors were Daggernose sharks (from Earth which were genetically modified to live on Nea. The terrestrial species is much smaller (1,5 m) and prefer the tropical waters at the east coast of South america. Like the later Krill shark these fishes already use their jaws like a fish trap and have long snouts which are full of sensory organs.In the Krill shark these adaptations were taken to an new extreme. The first generations of these animals were just 3 to 5 meters long, but thanks to the enormous amount of food in the Kurnugian Sea they grew up to this gigantic size, another example of Cope's rule.Nea, map and more stuff:
NEW YORK (Reuters) – U.S. companies are hoarding almost $1 trillion in cash but are unlikely to spend on expanding their business and hiring new employees due to continuing uncertainty about the strength of the economy, Moody's Investors Service said on Tuesday.
As the economy stabilizes companies are also more likely to spend on share repurchases and mergers and acquisitions, Moody's added.
Companies cut costs, reduced investment in plants and equipment and downsized operations in order to boost cash holdings during the recession. As the corporate bond market reopened many companies also boosted cash levels by selling debt and refinancing near-term debt maturities.
The US unemployment rate, meanwhile, sits at a whopping 9.2 percent. (A graph of the unemployment rates state by state can be found here).
Nonfinancial U.S. companies are sitting on $943 billion of cash and short-term investments, as of mid-year 2010, compared with $775 billion at the end of 2008, Moody's said. This would be enough to cover a year's worth of capital spending and dividends and still have $121 billion left over, it said.
However, “we believe companies are looking for greater certainty about the economy and signs of a permanent increase in sales before they let go of their cash hoards, which they suffered so much to build,” Moody's said in a report.
“Given low demand and capacity utilization within certain industries, companies are wary of investing their cash in new capacity and adding workers, thereby doing little to abbreviate the jobless recovery,” it added.
Around one quarter of the cash is held overseas and is unlikely to be repatriated to the United States, Moody's said.
Meanwhile only 20 companies hold a large portion of corporate cash balances, with $346 billion on their balance sheets, or 37 percent of the total, Moody's said.
Cisco Systems has the largest cash balance, at $39.86 billion, while Microsoft is second with $36.79 billion, Moody's said. Google has the third-largest balance with $30.06 billion, followed by Oracle with $23.64 billion and Ford Motor Co at $21.89 billion.
Technology companies held the most cash as a sector, at $207 billion, followed by pharmaceuticals with $124 billion, energy at $105 billion, and consumer products with $101 billion, Moody's said.

The apparent death of the man known as “Jihadi John,” the public face of the self-styled Islamic State, may represent a kind of karma but it doesn't bring closure for the father of one Japanese hostage beheaded nearly a year ago.
“It's not to say that it was heaven's punishment doing its work, but what you do to other people will come back to you,” Shoichi Yukawa said Saturday of the U.S. announcement that it was “reasonably certain” it had killed Kuwaiti-born Briton Mohammed Emwazi, described as the group's “lead executioner.”
Yukawa, 75, speaking at their home an hour east of Tokyo, chose their words as they reflected on the death of the man who murdered their son, Haruna, who was apparently beheaded in January after several months in the hands of the Islamic State group in Syria.
“I'm not happy that they (Emwazi) was attacked, but I know that the Syrian civil war is a horrible thing and I want it to end as soon as possible,” the father said quietly.
“Of course I have hatred toward the murderers, but more than that I want the war to end.”
Yukawa was speaking just hours after Islamic State supporters said the group was responsible for Friday's series of attacks in Paris that killed at least 129 people and prompted France to declare a state of emergency.
News on Friday that Emwazi had apparently been blown up in a U.S. and British drone strike in the Syrian town of Raqqa brought relief mingled with fresh anguish to the loved ones of others they claimed to have killed.
The capture and apparent beheadings in late 2014 and early 2015 of Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, a freelance journalist friend who went into Syria in an attempt to save him, transfixed Japan, a country largely spared from militant attacks and the horrors now spilling out of Syria.
Emwazi appeared in videos with Haruna Yukawa and Goto, who were kneeling beside them dressed in orange jumpsuits reminiscent of the those worn by prisoners at the U.S. military's Guantanamo Bay detention camp, and in the final videos, a week apart, announcing their executions. Each victim's body lay on the ground, its severed head placed on its back.
A picture of the two in happier times adorns the wide-screen TV in the living room of Yukawa's tidy, two-story tatami-matted home. A framed picture of their son stands on a Buddhist altar, near the phone that Yukawa and their wife have left disconnected since their son's abduction stoked a media maelstrom.
Haruna burst onto the public stage in a video of their capture and apparent beating by militants, who appeared to take the armed Japanese man, in black T-shirt and fatigues, as a mercenary.
According to Haruna's online journal and their father's comments at the time, however, the young man went to the Syrian city of Aleppo on a soul-searching journey.
They had recently lost their wife to cancer and seen their business go bust. They changed their name to the feminine-sounding Haruna, tried to kill themselves by cutting off their genitals and came to believe that they were the reincarnation of a cross-dressing Manchu princess who had spied for Japan in World War II.
Shoichi Yukawa, sitting on the floor at a low Japanese table and dressed in a thick sweater, appears calmer now and with a healthier complexion than during the hostage ordeal. They even smile when they start speaking about current events.
But they become subdued as they begin reading a May entry in their handwritten diary, which expresses a very Japanese sense of shame for creating a what they call a public nuisance.
“As the father of my son who has caused such a public commotion, I deeply feel a sense of moral responsibility,” they read, wiping away the occasional tear welling up behind their wide-framed glasses.
“I sincerely want to thank everyone, starting from those in the government, who have done their best to help.”
Foreign Ministry officials dropped off Haruna's duffle bag in March, two months after their execution. It took the father two more months to open it, finding their son's clothes, passport, toiletries and notebook.
Shoichi put the belongings in cardboard boxes in the small room where Haruna's other things are stored.
“This whole incident — it's not over for me,” the father said as they looked at the boxes.
A new species of feathered dinosaur was discovered in Russia, indicating that the trait may have been the norm rather than the exception. This newly found dinosaur was about five feet long and belonged to a group known as ornithischia. They were beaked herbivores.
Feathered dinosaurs were first found in China in 1996. But those specimens were all theropods. Tyrannosaurus rex is the most well-known member of this group. This, however, is the first time that a feathered dinosaur has been found outside of the theropod lineage.
This new ornithischian dinosaur, called Kulindadromeus, lived near Siberia's Kulinda River. It had feathery tufts on both its legs and elbows. It also had streamlined feathers on its back. While earlier discoveries of ornithischians in China had bristles that were feather-like, the Kulindadromeus discovery came complete with fossilized feather imprints.
The find, which included six skulls and many bones expands the number of families that had feathers. Plumes that covered earlier reptiles probably served as insulation. The fossiled imprints of Kulindadromeus are different than the ones found on other feathered dinosaurs and modern-day birds.
Theropods and ornithischians split about 220 million years ago. Finding feathered dinosaurs in both lineages suggests that the trait of having feathers was much more widespread in the dinosaur lineage. A major problem, however, is that feathers are rarely fossilized. It is also clear that while these creatures had feathers, they did not fly. Feathers themselves are also subject to the evolutionary process.
Describing this newly found dinosaur is the job of Pascal Godefroit, the lead author of the study. Previously, ornithischians were found with simple bristles or quills. However, scientists were unable to positively identify whether they were feathers.
Until the find in Russia, feathers and dinosaurs were thought to be exclusively the province of theropods. Dinosaurs were initially grouped into two basic divisions, saurischia and ornithischians. Theropods and sauropodomorphs both fall within the saurischia family.
Theropods include the largest two-legged carnivores to roam the earth. Birds are direct descendents of smaller, non-flying dinosaurs in this group. General characteristics of theropods include hollow bones, smaller hands, large feet with three weight bearing toes, sharp, curved teeth and claws at the end of each finger and toe.
Sauropodomorphs were mostly four-legged giant herbivores with long necks. They became the largest creatures ever to roam the earth. Their characteristics included a small, tiny head, a long tail to counteract the long neck, and weak, spoon-shaped teeth.
Ornithischians basically include everything that remains, including ceratopsians and hadrosaurs. They were herbivores and several had body armor, horns and spikes for protection like the stegosaurs, close relatives of the ankylosaurs. Their common thread was a pubis that pointed backwards. Birds also have a pubis that points backwards, but are not linked to this group, but rather evolved from the saurischia group.
There is significant evidence to support that birds evolved from the theropod dinosaurs. The Russian discovery, however, is the first evidence that the ornithischia with their backward pubis could also have been feather-like. It all goes to show that re-creating the evolutionary process is a continually changing endeavor.
Dinosaurs have captivated the imagination of people for millennia. Countless questions continue to be raised whenever new discoveries are made. Dinosaur stories and movies continue to fan a curiosity that seems it will never be satisfied. With each new discovery new debates of their evolutionary journey arise.
The find suggests that the ancestors of theropod and ornithischia dinosaurs had feathers. This greatly expands the number of feather-like dinosaurs and suggests that may have been the norm of the earliest dinosaurs.

While I was in Los Angeles in October of 2003, beginning my celebrity grave hunting adventures at the famous Hollywood Forever Cemetery, I had a rather strange experience. As I was walking toward the Abbey Of The Psalms Mausoleum, a feeling of dread came over me. I could think of no idea why I should feel so affraid, but as I got closer to it, the feeling grew. It got to the point where I was forcing myself to go forward. I don't know how far away from it I was when I finally stopped, but one thing was for sure, I could not continue and would not approach any further. I also actually felt a sudden need to go to the bathroom (which I found in the Office, thanks to Annette Lloyd). In all the other parts of the cemetery, I felt nothing but peace among the stillness of the graves and tombs, but for some strange reason, the AotP was different. At first, I couldn't figure out why, but then I felt that there was definitely something wrong about the place. I felt the need to try and get closer and as I did, I felt the presence of something there, the presence of something that shouldn't have been there at all. A mausoleum is supposed to be part of sacred ground, but I felt nothing sacred about this place. My theory is that somehow, a Gate or Door exists there, a Gate or Door to a place dark, cold and foreboding. A place of evil. And I think that it is through this Gateway or Door that something enters our world, something that has no business being here.
Oh Boy: Rolling Stone Piece is Even Worse Than You Thought
"Jackie's" Friends: Yeah, They Made Up This Guy They Had a Date With That Night Cooke excerpts a Washington Post piece which is absolutely damning, and, as they say, if not the final nail in the coffin, at least the one that pins the lid shut. The three friends who heard their claims the night they allegedly occurred now say that the story presented in Rolling Stone is very unlike the story they heard that night.

Okay, that's problematic, but we already sort of knew that, given that another friend had to point out the fraternity and tell "Jackie" "That's where you were raped."
They said there are mounting inconsistencies with the original narrative in the magazine. The students also expressed suspicions about Jackie's allegations from that night. They said the name they provided as that of their date did not match anyone at the university, and U-Va. officials confirmed to The Post that no one by that name has attended the school. And photographs that were texted to one of the friends showing their date that night actually were pictures depicting one of Jackie's high school classmates in Northern Virginia. That man, now a junior at a university in another state, confirmed that the photographs are of them and said they barely knew Jackie and hasn't been to Charlottesville for at least six years.

Antonio Gates hopes that they will see a reduced role in the 2015 season. They want to be a situational player.
The San Diego Chargers are dealing with all the noise from Philip Rivers rumors and the NFL Draft and now we are starting to hear some funky news about another Pro Bowl player on the roster. Apparently Antonio Gates is looking for a reduced role in the 2015 season.
“With injuries and whatnot, I played a little bit more than they expected me to play last season,” Gates said, via Emily Kaplan of MMQB.com. “I was playing the whole game. How I feel next year, it depends on how much volume they have me doing. I'd like to come in on third-and-7s, red zones, those situations. That's what my contribution is at anyway.”
Antonio Gates is looking for a reduced role, but their snap counts actually have decreased in each of the last 3 seasons. In 2012, they played in 859 snaps on offense. In 2013 they played in 843 snaps and in 2014 they played in 770 snaps. They still are looking for an even more reduced role and they want to be a situational player. They want to come into the game in 3rd down situations and in the red zone since that is their biggest contribution anyway.
Antonio Gates had 69 receptions in 2014 and 20 of those receptions came on 3rd down situations. 9 of those receptions came when the situation was 3rd and 7 or longer to rank 6th in the league.  They are good at making plays in those situations, but why would you limit your production?
I don't know if the Chargers will comply with the role that Antonio Gates is looking for, but it has to be a red flag of some sort. How does Philip Rivers feel about the role that Gates wants to play on offense? Gates is one of their favorite targets to throw to and now they want to take a reduced role?
If Gates were to sit back on the bench a little more in the 2015 season, it would open up some playing time for Ladarius Green to see action. Green didn't have the production that fans had hoped for in 2014. We are not sure what their role will be in 2015, but if Gates does take a step back, then that role for Green could be significant. Green showed a lot of potential as a threat in the passing game, but has not been able to consistently make an impact on offense. This would be their chance.
Antonio Gates will be entering the final year of their contract with the San Diego Chargers. If they are looking for a reduced role, then they would also be looking for a reduced paycheck if they want to continue playing football past the 2015 season.
Do they want to play past 2015? It doesn't sound like it.

Name (Age): Ciandre “CeCe” Taylor (39)
Current Residence: Granada Hills, CA via Buffalo, NY
Occupation: Insurance Adjuster
Hobbies: Writing, hiking/working out, and watching reality shows.
Pet Peeves: People who can't drive in traffic and people who cough and sneeze without covering their mouths.
Three Words to Describe You: Outgoing, strong minded, and goal setter.
NOTE: Usually I get a good thirty minutes with each contestant before the game starts. However, this season I had to get through all 20 players in only two-and-a-half hours. So, these pieces will be short and hopefully sweet.
Gordon Holmes: It says in your bio that you watch a lot of reality shows. Any titles in particular?
Ciandre “CeCe” Taylor: “Survivor,” “The Amazing Race,” those are the two biggest ones I watch…”Dancing with the Stars.”
Holmes: You got the important one in there.
Taylor: (Laughs) Yup.
Holmes: What do your kids think about Mom's million-dollar opportunity?
Taylor: They're super excited, but they're teenagers, so they have to have that laid-back attitude as well.
Holmes: If my Mom went on “Survivor” I would freak right out.
Taylor: That's what I'm saying! Every time I ask them how they feel about it, they're like, “Eh…yeah…we're happy.”
Holmes: Any advice from them?
Taylor: Just to be careful with my words. Don't go in there all crazy in the beginning.
Holmes: Are you known to go all crazy?
Taylor: No, I'm talkative, I say things before I think. I read people and I like to speak about it and talk and give an opinion. And they're like, “Mom, just relax.”
Holmes: “Survivor” is often a game that features deception. Do you have any issues with lying?
Taylor: Not at all. I do it for a living. I'm a claims adjuster and I talk to attorneys all day. Sometimes I have to bend the truth a little bit.
Holmes: Well, it's not like attorneys are always truthful.
Taylor: Exactly. (Laughs)
Holmes: Are you comfortable flirting to get ahead?
Taylor: If it happens, it happens, but I'm not going to say it's a tool of mine. I'm not normally a flirtatious, sexy person. That's not really me.
Holmes: If the CBS cameras catch you flirting, is there anyone back home that's going to be upset?
Taylor: Not at all. There's no one special in my life right now.
Holmes: Aww… (Laughs)
Taylor: I know!
Holmes: Let's discuss some things you might experience out there. How well do you deal with people lying to you?
Taylor: I can deal with it. People lie, it's life. You can try to be honest, but it happens. I lie to my kids sometimes to protect them from something.
Holmes: How about hunger?
Taylor: I…I'm OK with it. I do a spiritual fast from time to time with my church. My biggest issue is probably dealing with the cold.
Holmes: How about sleep deprivation?
Taylor: I'm sleep deprived right now. (Laughs) I've been running on little energy for a while now.
Holmes: This is going to be like a vacation for you.
Taylor: (Laughs) I know.
Holmes: How about paranoia?
Taylor: I'm not a paranoid person. I think I'm a little overdramatic. But not paranoid.
Holmes: An early thought on the other players?
Taylor: Not at this time. I can't even read anything until we're all in a room together.
Holmes: If there is a twist this season, any guesses as to what it could be?
Taylor: If they bring that twist where you have to go to the island by yourself, I'm just going to die. (Laughs) I hate that one!
Holmes: So Day One, Jeff says, “We're sending someone to Exile.” You're going to say, “No thanks. See you guys later.”
Taylor: I would deal with it, but I hate Exile Island. That's the only one that they brought to the game where I was like “NO!”
Holmes: You could finally get some sleep.
Taylor: Yeah, you can get some sleep but you're going to be hungry and cold if you don't have someone who can start a fire with you.
Holmes: If you could align with any past player, who would it be?
Taylor: “Boston” Rob (Mariano) they are the greatest. He's such a people person. They know how to read them and bring them in. It's kind of scary. They have a little cult. I don't want to be cult-like, but he's a master manipulator. I love him, I think he's the best player of all time.
Holmes: Alright, lightning round time. Cats or dogs?
Taylor: Dogs.
Holmes: Beer or wine?
Taylor: Wine.
Holmes: Superman or Batman?
Taylor: Superman.
Holmes: Meat or vegetable?
Taylor: Meat.
Holmes: Republican or Democrat?
Taylor: Democrat.
Holmes: Books or TV?
Taylor: TV.
Holmes: Swimming or sunbathing?
Taylor: Sunbathing.
Holmes: Many casual friends or one good friend?
Taylor: One good friend.
Holmes: A nice car or a nice home?
Taylor: A nice home.
Holmes: Smart or funny?
Taylor: Funny.
Holmes: I know the answer to this one; Parvati or Boston Rob?
Taylor: (Laughs) Boston Rob.
Holmes: Big vacation or big TV?
Taylor: Big vacation.
Holmes: Working alone or with a team?
Taylor: Working with…no…working alone.

Anthony, one of the first women's rights activists, died 14 years before women got the right to vote.
People have been leaving stickers at Anthony's grave since early voting began in October, according to CNN. Voters on Tuesday left stickers, balloons, stuffed animals and flowers at Anthony's grave. Many paused for a photo.
The cemetery, which is expecting crowds throughout the day, will be open until 9 p.m. Tuesday. It usually closes at 5:30 p.m.

Jayden is only 5 years old and suffers from a rare form of epilepsy. Their father, Jason David, tearfully shares how the only relief from their son's physical pain and life-threatening seizures is from a nonpsychoactive molecule found in cannabis, called cannabidiol. However, recent crackdowns and closures of medical marijuana dispensaries throughout California have made finding relief for Jayden more challenging. That's what has motivated Rep. Barbara Lee to introduce H.R. 6335, the Medical Marijuana Property Rights Protection Act, to stop the unnecessary raiding of dispensaries.
Recent attempts to close down many dispensaries, including Harborside Health Center in Oakland, where Jayden and 108,000 other patients seek respite, have threatened forfeiture and charges to owners and landlords who lease space to medical marijuana dispensaries. The legislation by Lee would stop the seizure of property from landlords of state-compliant medical marijuana businesses and not implicate property owners in the businesses of their tenants.
Over the years, medical marijuana dispensaries have provided a safe and professional service to hundreds of thousands of patients living with AIDS, cancer and other life-inhibiting conditions. Safe access is essential to guaranteeing responsible use of medical marijuana. It is irrational that anyone would oppose patients' safe access to medical treatment. That's why we were all shocked to witness the “paramilitary sting” to shut down a renowned facility such as Oaksterdam University earlier this year.
Oaksterdam University was a medical marijuana training school, founded in 2007, and offered classes in horticulture, business and legal application of running a dispensary. From the aggressive raid at the school in April, one would think law enforcers would confiscate thousands of pounds in marijuana. Instead, there were no reports of illegal possession or misuse. The school does not distribute marijuana for medical or recreational use, contrary to popular assumptions.
The shutdown of Oaksterdam revealed how beloved by the community the school was. For years, it trained caregivers with the necessary tools to aid seriously and terminally ill patients and to do it with dignity and sympathy. More than 100 people lost their jobs when the federal government shut down Oaksterdam.
These raids are also threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of trained professionals who own and work at medical marijuana dispensaries. The Blue Sky Dispensary in Oakland was a 15-year registered-permitted facility with a unionized workforce of trained professionals. It was forced to close due to the threats of federal forfeiture action. Those patients that relied on the safe access to care were left to fend for themselves, and dozens of employees lost their jobs and health care for their families.
In May, our very own Berkeley Patients Group became one of the largest casualties of the federal crackdown after threats of federal property seizure. Nearly 100 workers were let go, many of whom had been at the facility since its opening 12 years ago. These workers had good paying jobs with health care benefits and retirement security. BPG has since announced its relocation to San Pablo Avenue.
People who have dedicated their lives to treating patients with humane care are being attacked. But why we need H.R. 6335 to become law is for the Jaydens in our state.
Without safe access to medical marijuana, Jayden's dad and other patients would be left to fend for themselves to seek treatment. Patients desperate for care would be forced to go back onto street corners and “underground” to seek medicinal care — and that only puts more lives in jeopardy. No one in America should succumb to these desperate acts to seek out care when it could be provided and guaranteed if Congress only passes H.R. 6335.
We urge the passage of H.R. 6335 immediately, and we applaud Lee for their continued commitment to safe and professional care for our communities not only in the 9th Congressional District but across the country.
Dan Rush is a resident of the 9th Congressional District and chair of the Berkeley Medical Cannabis Commission.  They are also national director of the Medical Cannabis and Hemp Division at the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.
Clashes between protesters and police erupted outside a mosque in Cairo [AFP]
Protests have erupted in cities across Egypt, with demonstrators demanding an end to Hosni Mubarak's presidency.
Tens of thousands took to the streets across the country following Friday midday prayers.
State TV said a curfew will be imposed from 6pm to 7am local time.
Egyptian military vehicles were sighted on the streets of Cairo on Friday after a day of violent clashes between police and protesters demanding an end to President Hosni Mubarak's rule.
Protesters had previously chanted slogans calling for the army to support them, complaining of police violence during clashes on Friday in which security forces fired teargas and rubber bullets.
"Where is the army? Come and see what the police is doing to us. We want the army. We want the army," the protesters in one area of central Cairo shouted, shortly before police fired teargas on them.
Al Jazeera's Ayman Mohyeldin, reporting from Cairo, said protesters reacted positively when an armoured vehicle with troops showed up, possibly indicating that it belonged to the military.
"The army is a respected establishment in Egypt, and many feel they need their support against what they see as excessive force by the police and security forces," they said.
Earlier, clashes between protesters and police erupted outside a mosque in Cairo.
Protesters reportedly threw stones and dirt at the police after security forces confronted them. They held up posters saying "No to dictatorship" and stamped on posters of Mubarak.
Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh, reporting from the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, said protesters streamed out of mosques shortly after prayers to chant slogans against Mubarak. Police responded immediately, firing tear gas to disperse the crowd.
Alexandria is a stronghold of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's technically banned but largest political opposition group, but Rageh said the crowds in the city predominantly consisted of "ordinary citizens".
"This is the same mosque where protests were held against police brutality in June after a 20-year-old man was beaten to death by police," they said. "It's very symbolic that the current protests are taking place at the same place all over again."
Protests were also reported in Suez, a port on the Red Sea east of Cairo, and in the Nile Delta cities of Mansoura and Sharqiya, witnesses said.
Friday marked the fourth consecutive day of protests in the Middle East's most populous nation coming on the heels of a social uprising in nearby Tunisia that ousted that country's president of 23 years.
Mohamed ElBaradei, the former head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog and an opposition leader in Egypt, returned to the country on Thursday night after telling reporters they were ready to lead a "transition" if asked. On Friday, they prayed with thousands of worshippers at a mosque in Cairo and had reportedly been prevented from moving freely by security forces.
The countrywide violence has so far left seven people dead.
In response, the government has promised to crack down on demonstrations and arrest those participating in them. It has blocked internet, mobile phone and SMS services in order to disrupt the planned demonstrations.
Internet shut down
Before Egypt shut down internet access on Thursday night, activists were posting and exchanging messages using social networking services such as Facebook and Twitter, listing more than 30 mosques and churches where protesters were to organise on Friday.
"Egypt's Muslims and Christians will go out to fight against corruption, unemployment and oppression and absence of freedom," a page with more than 70,000 signatories said.
The Associated Press news agency reported that an elite special counterterrorism force had been deployed at strategic points around Cairo, and Egypt's interior ministry warned of "decisive measures".
Safwat Sherif, the secretary-general of the ruling National Democratic Party, told reporters on Thursday: "We hope that tomorrow's Friday prayers and its rituals happen in a quiet way that upholds the value of such rituals ... and that no one jeopardises the safety of citizens or subjects them to something they do not want."
Meanwhile, a lawyer for the Muslim Brotherhood said that 20 members of the officially banned group had been detained overnight.
Abdel-Moniem Abdel-Maksoud said two of the most senior movement members were detained: Essam El-Erian, its main spokesperson, and Mohammed Moursi, a prominent Brotherhood leader.
Fierce clashes
On Thursday, protesters hurled petrol bombs at a fire station in Suez, setting it ablaze. They tried but failed to set fire to a local office of the ruling National Democratic Party. At another rally near Giza on the outskirts of Cairo, police used tear gas to break up hundreds of protesters late at night.

When Egypt turned off the internet
Egypt goes off the digital map as authorities unplug the country entirely from the internet ahead of protests.
Cairo, normally vibrant on a Thursday night ahead of the weekend, was largely deserted, with shops and restaurants shut. In the city of Ismailia, hundreds of protesters clashed with police who used tear gas and batons to disperse them.
"This is a revolution," one 16-year-old protester said in Suez . "Every day we're coming back here."
"The intensity continues to increase," Al Jazeera's Jamal Elshayyal reported from Suez.
"There have been fierce clashes with rubber-coated steel bullets being fired by the riot police as well as tear gas."
Restraint urged
Human Rights Watch said Egyptian police had escalated the use of force against largely peaceful demonstrations and called it "wholly unacceptable and disproportionate".
Barack Obama, the US president, urged both the government and protesters to show restraint as they expressed their "pent-up frustrations". Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, had earlier said that the protests offered the Mubarak government an opportunity to institute social, economic, and political reforms.
"It is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances," Obam said as they answered questions from an online audience on the YouTube website.
Obama also urged Mubarak to make changes to the political system to appease the angry protesters.
"I've always said to them that making sure that they are moving forward on reform - political reform, economic reform - is absolutely critical for the long-term well-being of Egypt."
Introduction
Fade2Karma is a new professional eSports Hearthstone team that was formed recently. It consists of top players like Hawkeye and Dethelor. (Gosugamers announcement here, F2K's Twitter and LiquidHearth‘s announcement here.)
The F2K Meta Report focuses on the class/deck representation in the European Legend Ladder on a biweekly basis. Hundreds of ladder games played by our players allow us to determine which are the most popular decks on ladder and which decks have fallen out of favor by most.
Since this is our first report ever and coincidently also the last one for the Black Rock Mountain era, it is a good summary on what happened after BRM release.
The Ranking
Sample Deck Lists
Analysis
Before Black Rock Mountain the strongest decks were Mech Mage, Tempo Mage, Demonlock, Oil Rogue, Face Hunter, Combo Druid and Midrange Paladin.
With the introduction of Imp Gang Boss after the BRM release Zoolock got a huge buff and hence became the best warlock archetype.
Together with the birth of the first unrefined Grim Patron Warrior lists, Zoolock pushed Mech Mage completely out of the meta. Both Imp Gang Boss and Grim Patron were too hard of a counter to Mech Mage's strongest power play; the turn 4 Goblin Blastmage.
With Emperor Thaurissan entering the format, Combo Druid at first got a huge boost.
But with Grim Patron lists becoming more efficient over time, people figuring out how to play the deck better, and the rising popularity of both Tempo Mage with Flamewaker and Midrange Hunter with Quickshots, people quickly realized that Druid no longer belonged to the strongest ladder decks.
Furthermore Emperor allowed the creation of 2 new viable deck archetypes: Echo Giants Mage and Malygos Warlock.
The Rise of Grim Patron Warrior lead to the fall of Oil Rogue and Midrange Paladin. The former because of people playing Rogue's nemesis, Control Warrior, to counter Grim Patron Warrior. The Latter because of its weakness against the Grim Patron.
One of the final developments in the BRM meta was the climb of aggro Paladin to a top-tier deck, for the simple reason that it has decent matchups against the other top-tier classes.
Conclusion
Grim Patron Warrior remains the most popular and strongest deck until the end of the BRM era. The deck has no hard counters, only softcounters. The counters of those softcounter decks are all weak to Grim Patron Warrior. For that specific reason there is no rock-paper-scissor scenario we had in previous metagames.
Hunter and Warlock, carried by their powerful heropower, remain top-tier classes.
Aggro Paladin being able to compete with the top-tier decks, makes it so that Paladin narrowly ranks above the second tier classes: Mage, Druid and Rogue.
Finally there is Priest and Shaman which barely sees any play on ladder , besides a Lightbomb-/OTK Priest or Mech Shaman here and there.

Marriage equality advocates are keeping the anti-plebiscite pressure on up until the Senate votes on the bill, with a new video featuring members of Ireland's LGBTI community. Supplied Orla Howard and Grainne Courtney with daughter Daire Courtney.
Commissioned by LGBTI advocacy groups PFLAG and Just Equal, the video shows people in same-sex relationships and their families talking about the experience of the Irish referendum on same-sex marriage.
It comes as the Australian LGBTI community wait for the marriage equality plebiscite bill to reach the Senate, where it will likely be voted down by a coalition of Labor, Greens, and crossbench MPs. Shelley Argent, the national spokesperson for PFLAG, told BuzzFeed News the video shows the "huge and unnecessary strain" a plebiscite would put on the LGBTI community and their families.
Supplied Breda Iredale
In the video, Dublin man Ross Golden-Bannon talks about how "emotionally and psychologically draining" the process of door-knocking and asking for "yes" votes was. "Every time we had to do it, it brought back terrible memories for a lot of people," they said. "I met people who privately told me that they went home and cried every night, after they'd canvassed." Their closest friend, Breda Iredale, spoke about a particularly nasty door-knocking incident after entering a man's home to talk to him. "He said to me, 'Do you expect me to go out and vote for men sticking their cocks up other men's?' I just said alright, thank you, and I walked out," they said. "I'm an older woman – no one has ever said anything like that to me."

Daire Courtney, who has two mothers, said it is easy for people who were not there to "see the good things from outside".
"But they weren't here to experience the negative stuff," they said. "And we all said, even after it passed, if we could have done it through legislation and avoided the campaign, we all would have." I mothers, Orla Howard and Grainne Courtney, had a "no" poster – one of only two they saw up in their local area – placed on a telegraph pole directly across the street from their house.

Simon Blanckensee, from Wicklow, Ireland, said they appreciated the opportunity to say how proud they were of their child, Sam, but felt they shouldn't have had to do it. "I felt that I was going around with a begging bowl, asking people to give something away that it wasn't theirs to give," they said. "Ireland isn't the same as it was beforehand, and there is more conversation, but I think the cost of that conversation was too high." Earlier this week, The Australian reported that government backbencher Warren Entsch had pitched a different plebiscite model to the Nick Xenophon Team. Entsch suggested a plebiscite made cheaper by electronic or postal voting, a binding result, and extra funding for mental health group Headspace. However, many advocates do not want a plebiscite under any circumstances. "Warren Entsch has proposed a less expensive online plebiscite but that misses the point," Argent told BuzzFeed News. "The fundamental problem with a plebiscite is the human cost, not the financial cost."

The plebiscite does not have the numbers to pass the Senate, with 39 senators pledging to vote against and one government senator, Dean Smith, saying they will abstain.
The video will be attached to emails sent through the Make It Law campaign website, run by PFLAG and Just Equal. More than 400,000 emails have been sent to politicians asking for a free vote on marriage equality through the site. "We are stepping up our campaign against a plebiscite and for a free vote to be absolutely sure it is knocked on the head," Just Equal spokesperson Ivan Hinton-Teoh told BuzzFeed News. "In the final days before the Senate vote we will be encouraging even more Australians to now share this powerful video with their politicians."
Over the coming days a curiously revealing event will be taking place in Copenhagen. Top of the agenda at a meeting of the Polar Bear Specialist Group (set up under the International Union for the Conservation of Nature/Species Survival Commission) will be the need to produce a suitably scary report on how polar bears are being threatened with extinction by human-made global warming.
This is one of a steady drizzle of events planned to stoke up alarm in the run-up to the UN's major conference on climate change in Copenhagen next December. But one of the world's leading experts on polar bears has been told to stay away from this week's meeting, specifically because their views on global warming do not accord with those of the rest of the group.
Dr Mitchell Taylor has been researching the status and management of polar bears in Canada and around the Arctic Circle for 30 years, as both an academic and a government employee. More than once since 2006 they have made headlines by insisting that polar bear numbers, far from decreasing, are much higher than they were 30 years ago. Of the 19 different bear populations, almost all are increasing or at optimum levels, only two have for local reasons modestly declined.
Dr Taylor agrees that the Arctic has been warming over the last 30 years. But they ascribe this not to rising levels of CO2 – as is dictated by the computer models of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and believed by their PBSG colleagues – but to currents bringing warm water into the Arctic from the Pacific and the effect of winds blowing in from the Bering Sea.
They have also observed, however, how the melting of Arctic ice, supposedly threatening the survival of the bears, has rocketed to the top of the warmists' agenda as their most iconic single cause. The famous photograph of two bears standing forlornly on a melting iceberg was produced thousands of times by Al Gore, the WWF and others as an emblem of how the bears faced extinction – until last year the photographer, Amanda Byrd, revealed that the bears, just off the Alaska coast, were in no danger. Them picture had nothing to do with global warming and was only taken because the wind-sculpted ice they were standing on made such a striking image.
Dr Taylor had obtained funding to attend this week's meeting of the PBSG, but this was voted down by its members because of their views on global warming. The chairperson, Dr Andy Derocher, a former university pupil of Dr Taylor's, frankly explained in an email (which I was not sent by Dr Taylor) that their rejection had nothing to do with their undoubted expertise on polar bears: "it was the position you've taken on global warming that brought opposition".
Dr Taylor was told that their views running "counter to human-induced climate change are extremely unhelpful". Their signing of the Manhattan Declaration – a statement by 500 scientists that the causes of climate change are not CO2 but natural, such as changes in the radiation of the sun and ocean currents – was "inconsistent with the position taken by the PBSG".
So, as the great Copenhagen bandwagon rolls on, stand by this week for reports along the lines of "scientists say polar bears are threatened with extinction by vanishing Arctic ice". But also check out Anthony Watt's Watts Up With That website for the latest news of what is actually happening in the Arctic. The average temperature at midsummer is still below zero, the latest date that this has happened in 50 years of record-keeping. After last year's recovery from its September 2007 low, this year's ice melt is likely to be substantially less than for some time. The bears are doing fine.

It's been rumored for a while, but it looks like NBC is officially reviving The Office for the 2018-2019 television season.
While some fans are undoubtedly excited to return to Scranton, Pennsylvania, details are scarce — beyond the fact that the revival is happening and that it will feature both new and old cast members, nothing has been confirmed.
This is the second major series revival from NBC. This year also saw the triumphant return of one of NBC's most popular sitcoms, Will and Grace, which has earned both great ratings and positive critical response. The revival season even pulled in Golden Globe nominations. NBC is probably hoping that wave of positivity will carry on to the new season of The Office.
The announcement does raise some questions, however. Hearing that both old and new cast members will return is interesting, but The Office doesn't have the best track record when it comes to major ensemble shake-ups. Despite finishing on a high note, there was arguably a downturn in quality after Steve Carell, who played the show's eccentric boss, Michael Scott, left the show in season 7. A quick glance at The Office's major cast members shows a list of actors who are all enjoying busy post-Office careers — including John Krasinski, Ellie Kemper, Craig Robinson, Rainn Wilson, Mindy Kaling, and, of course, Steve Carell, to name a few. Landing even half of the original cast could be difficult.
Another question is, what exactly is this new season going to be about? Unlike other high-profile revivals such as, say, The X-Files or Twin Peaks, which left fans with questions and cliffhanger endings that lingered until their returns, The Office ended in a tidy fashion with every major plot point and character arc resolved when it wrapped in 2013.
An injection of new cast members could solve this, but usually the point of these revivals is to bring back fan-favorite characters and plotlines. Do we really need to see Jim and Pam further develop their relationship, or Dwight achieve some further career goal? It all seems potentially superfluous.
We'll know the answers to these questions sooner rather than later. With a premiere slated for the 2018-2019 TV season, production will have to get underway quickly. We'll be sure to update you as we learn more.
The country's eight charter schools paid their owners or related entities more than $1 million for administration and management services last year.

The schools' financial statements for 2015 also showed most underspent their property funding from the government by $100,000 or more last year.
Under-Secretary for Education and ACT party leader David Seymour said it was up to each of the schools to decide how to use their funding in the best interests of their students.

"What we measure is how much money goes in for education and what sort of educational results come out for the children."
The financial statements showed the eight schools paid the organisations that own them or related companies as much as $360,000 for administration and management in 2015.
Collectively those payments appeared to have totalled at least $1.25m from total funding of about $14m last year.
Vanguard Military School chief executive Nick Hyde said the payments were no different to any other school.
"Take the admin costs of most secondary schools and things like property management, budgets, payroll - we have to do all those things. Usually other schools have a property manager which they pay for, they have someone doing the payroll, they have admin staff," they said.
The South Auckland and West Auckland middle schools are run by the Villa Education Trust.
The schools' academic manager Alwyn Poole said they made payments to the trust for centralised services and management and those payments were higher when the schools were being set up.
"So for South Auckland Middle School in the first 15 months it was $260,000 and that's down to $140,000 and for Middle School West Auckland in their start-up year that was $240,000 and that's down to $150,000 for 2016," they said.
"Those are centralised salaries, and there are four of those, it's centralised accounting services and other admin tasks that go across the schools."
Mr Poole said the organisation was an audited charitable trust and it was not making any profit from the schools.
The financial statements and Education Ministry figures indicate the eight schools collectively received about $3,175,000 for property and insurance last year and spent about half that amount on such expenses.
One of the biggest differences in that spending was in Whangarei where They Puna Marama Trust spent just a third of the $738,000 it received from the government for property for its secondary school and just 18 percent of its primary school's $128,000 property grant, on property expenses.
The trust's chief executive, Raewyn Tipene, said the money that was not used for property last year was being used for building this year.
"The result is a newly built primary school, albeit small, and a central, medium-size city secondary school built inside old buildings," they said.
Ms Tipene said the trust had spent about $4m on property in the past two years and the two schools had been built for a fraction of the cost of a new state school.
Other charter schools were using their property funding to lease premises for less than what the government was giving them for property.
Mr Seymour said it was entirely appropriate for the schools to make savings on property so they could spend more on other education expenses.
They said some were using community resources like fields and swimming pools that were empty during school hours.
"That's what South Auckland Middle School's done and that's a really welcome development. It's certainly not as people have regrettably and cynically described it, a loophole. It's a flexibility and a strength of the policy that they can deploy their resources to get the best outcomes for children."
Post Primary Teachers Association president Angela Roberts said that approach would not work if every school abandoned their fields, libraries and pools and used community resources instead.
They said charter schools, or at least those with secondary students, were able to make their property funding go further because they did not have to provide everything that was required of a state school.
"They don't have to worry about providing an entire curriculum like every other school has to do for example, and they have very small sites. While they may look very entrepreneurial and very flexible at cutting costs, I think there would not be lessons that could be applied right across the schooling network."
Mr Seymour said RNZ should scrutinise the teacher unions and state schools as many charter schools.
But Educational Institute director of campaigns Stephanie Mills said it was important to keep the schools under the spotlight.
"It's important to look at the financials for charter schools because the whole experiment is based on the kind of market idea that if you give these schools the money they'll spend it in the best possible way to get the best possible student achievement," they said.
"Taxpayers have a right to really want to drill down into what's happening there and see if in fact this experiment is working, either from a financial perspective or from the point of view of the students in the schools."
Ms Mills said it was ironic charter schools would use their property funding on other things, when the government wanted to ringfence state schools' property funding.

Snap Inc., the company that brought you disappearing messages and puking rainbow filters, may soon be worth more than $20 billion.
Snapchat's parent company is looking to price its upcoming initial public offering at between $14 and $16 a share, according to a company filing on Thursday.
At the high end of that range, Snap would have a market value of more than $22 billion.
Snap would also be the biggest U.S. tech IPO since Facebook (FB), which went public in 2012 with a $104 billion valuation. In fact, Snap would be nearly double the value of Twitter (TWTR), which currently has a market cap of about $12 billion.
The pricing is not final, but it's the clearest indication yet that Snap is seeking a lofty valuation despite investor concerns.
Related: Snapchat's IPO has a Twitter problem
The young company saw user growth slow to a halt in the final months of last year, according to its original IPO filing earlier this month. The slowdown coincided with Facebook's Instagram launching a Snapchat copycat feature.
Snap's sales are growing at a fast pace, rising to more than $400 million in 2016 from just $58.7 million in 2015. Most analysts expect Snap to report around $1 billion in sales this year. That would mean Snap hopes to be valued at more than 20 times its sales.
Snap also continues to struggle to make money -- and it signaled a profit may not be coming soon. The company suffered losses of $515 million in 2016, up from a loss of $373 million the year before.
The company could end up raising nearly $3.7 billion from the public offering if it prices at $16 per share. Those funds would give Snap greater ability to compete for talent and acquisitions against larger Internet companies like Facebook.
"We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary businesses, products, services, or technologies," Snap said in its filing. "However, we are not contemplating any material acquisitions at this time."

The Snapchat app launched in 2011 and set itself apart from other messaging services with a focus on disappearing messages. It initially developed a reputation as a service for sending salacious pictures, but has since moved far beyond that.
Today, Snap defines itself as a "camera company." It sells Spectacles for recording videos and has built up its flagship app with augmented reality lenses that make sharing posts with friends more playful and engaging.
Snapchat's success has forced larger tech services like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to clone its features, with mixed success. Facebook famously tried to acquire the company for $3 billion in 2013.
The sum sounded outlandish at the time -- now, not so much.
A male employee of Netmarble Games, Korea's top mobile game developer, leaped to their death from the company building after being fired for alleged embezzlement.
The employee, surnamed Park, 36, jumped from the 20th floor at Guro-dong, Guro-gu district in Seoul, at around 3:20 p.m. on Friday, Yeongdeungpo police said. The company had fired Park for allegedly embezzling cyber money and selling it to game users for hundreds of millions of won.
"We are deeply sorry for their death," Netmarble said in a statement. "Park seems to have taken an extreme measure after getting fired for laying their hands on the company's asset for their own benefit."
Although a suicide note has not been found, a rumor on the Internet said a letter had been found in a mobile group chat room they used with colleagues. "I got fired today, which I don't object to because it was my fault," reads the alleged letter. "But they completely ignored my last demands for mercy and insulted me to the point where I couldn't stand anymore. "I'm leaving this cold-blooded company." Police are investigating the suicide.
Formed in 2000, Netmarble Games has produced some Korea's most successful mobile games such as "Everybody's Marble," "Rise of Ravens (also known as "EvilBane" in the U.S.) and "Seven Knights."

From a purely intellectual perspective, one of the fascinating things about the emergence of inequality as a top-tier political issue is the relatively inchoate nature of the debate. It's not that inequality is a new problem in American life, or that American thinkers have had nothing to say about it. Rather, it's that our accumulated thinking on inequality can now be paired with detailed, reliable data on income and social mobility, in a political climate where these issues are suddenly prominent. Just take a look at the newest political terms to surface in the last few years: the 1 percent, the 99 percent, the 47 percent; Occupy; r > g. Income and social mobility in post-2008 America is an extreme and distinctive twist on an old problem—and so the contours of the debate are not wholly formed.
This is both exciting and worrisome. Exciting, because it presents an opportunity for fresh thinking; worrisome, because our first stabs at thinking through this problem are likely to be crude and misguided. As I noted last October, things aren't helped by refusing to take inequality seriously, a problem which is all too common on the American right. Dismissing concerns about inequality with glib questions about whether critics would rather live in Cuba—which was, more or less, the Manhattan Institute's response—is not terribly clarifying. That's why some recent remarks from Harvard economist N. Gregory Mankiw are more promising. Mankiw, in a paper on Thomas Piketty, concludes with some reflections on inequality and democracy:
A final possibility is that wealth inequality is somehow a threat to democracy. Piketty alludes to this worry throughout their book. I am less concerned. The wealthy includes supporters of both the right (the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson) and the left (George Soros, Tom Steyer), and despite high levels of inequality, in 2008 and 2012 the United States managed to elect a left-leaning president committed to increasing taxes on the rich. The fathers of American democracy, including George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and James Madison, were very rich men. With estimated net worth (in today's dollars) ranging from $20 million to $500 million, they were likely all in the top 0.1 percent of the wealth distribution, demonstrating that the accumulation of capital is perfectly compatible with democratic values.
Re-reading this passage, I'm left wondering what Mankiw means by “democracy” when they pooh-pooh the threat posed by inequality. Consider their reassurance that there are “right” and “left” among the wealthy—both the Koch Brothers and George Soros. The implication here is that these billionaires don't present a special class of the ultra-powerful that threatens democracy—either because their opposing views cancel each other out, or because, coming from the right and left, they represent the full spectrum of political opinion in America. Neither assumption is plausible, and the second assumption misses a key argument behind criticisms of economic inequality: that the Koch Brothers and George Soros, by virtue of their extraordinary wealth, have shared interests that go beyond right-left ideology. As recent scholarship has shown, the affluent do have distinct policy preferences (although they aren't consistently liberal or conservative), and the political system almost always follows their preferences when they conflict with those of the less well-off. Or, as the political scientist E.E. Schattschneider once pithily remarked: “The flaw in the pluralist heaven is that the heavenly chorus sings with a strong upper-class accent.”
Next, Mankiw notes that “despite high levels of inequality, in 2008 and 2012 the United States managed to elect a left-leaning president committed to increasing taxes on the rich.” The suggestion here is that one might expect an unequal polity to produce conservative leaders—in other words, that if the rich were really in control, they'd select a president to advance their economic interests. But this didn't happen, Mankiw says, proving that inequality isn't threatening American democracy. Billionaires, they suggest, have not managed to drag the country to the right in order to advance their own class interests. This is an odd argument coming after the preceding sentence: at first, Mankiw had allowed that billionaires like the Koch Brothers and George Soros are politically powerful, but they denied that they're mostly conservative, and they didn't consider the idea that they could be united by a set of class interests that transcend ideological differences. Now, he's suggesting that they are mostly conservative and united by class interests, but that it doesn't matter, because they're politically impotent. Which is it?
Mankiw's final argument invokes the Founders. The immense wealth of figures like Washington and Jefferson, they argue, demonstrates that “the accumulation of capital is perfectly compatible with democratic values.” Dylan Matthews has already made the only possible response to this argument, which is to point out that much of the Founders' capital was in the form of slaves. The political system they created upheld that economic arrangement—a shared interest among the ultra-wealthy that, in some cases, transcended other ideological differences. This shared interest is precisely what Mankiw initially implied did not exist, then claimed does exist, but doesn't matter. As their example unintentionally shows, history demonstrates precisely the opposite.
I genuinely have no idea why Cubs fans acted mourned the 2012 season. Our two-headed monster of Theo Epstein and Jed Hoyer made it abundantly clear that their number one goal was to build a sustainable roster that can compete year in and year out. This is a change in philosophy from the previous regime. No instant gratification, no horrific extension for non-homegrown players. Ultimately, the next few years were going to be a step towards something big. One long, slow step.
I get it — a 101-loss season should be viewed as a complete and total failure. Me, being the eternal Cubs optimist, actually took several positives away from the 2012 season:
Turnarounds from Alfonso Soriano and Carlos Marmol were like your parents handing you a tiny box as a birthday present, then coming to find out it was the key to your first car. After a terrible 2011 and beginning to their 2012 season, Marmol finished their last two months strong (7 saves, an ERA under 1, and 32 strikeouts in only 23 innings pitched). The flirtation with Dan Haren showed that teams would at least entertain the notion of adding Marmol to their roster, so the Cubs may find a suitor for their services as early as the Winter Meetings.
Ditto for Soriano. They had, hands down, their best season since 2008. While the $36 million he's owed over the next two seasons may be hard to swallow, teams have to be encouraged by their ability to stay healthy over the last few seasons and the resurgence of their power numbers (32 bombs, 108 ribbies). AL teams who need corner outfield help or a platoon DH guy with some pop could come calling if the injury bug bites them.
We also should have bright eyes for the arrival of Jeff Samardzija and Anthony Rizzo. Both appear to be building blocks moving forward, Rizzo especially. If their cameo is any indication, there's no reason to believe that a 23-year-old first baseman can't routinely sniff .300 and bang out 30 homers and 100 RBIs in the Friendly Confines. Samardzija also looked dominant for stretches, cementing themselves as a solid mid-tier starter with room for improvement. Hopefully, there are no more ghastly bullpen experiments.
We can't expect many more wins if the roster stays the same. So here are three suggestions for the Cubs to continue their build towards a World Series.
Find solutions at third base and behind the plate. Not in a few years — right now
Saying the Ian Stewart experiment failed would be like telling somebody the sky is blue. With talks that the Cubs may look at bringing back Stewart if their wrist proves healthy, this should be an indication that that Josh Vitters is simply too far away to help the major league squad on a daily basis (I would agree 100%) or maybe that he's not the answer in the hot corner (a little more farfetched given their age). Catcher is also a disaster for the Cubs. Trust me, I don't lose sleep over Geovanny Soto's departure, but the Cubs' cache of questionable catchers is arguably their biggest gap on offense. In 2012, Cubs' catchers combined for an anemic sub-.300 OBP and a slugging percentage that my mother could probably rival.
So, what's the solution? I think the Cubs need to find answers for those two positions now. What causes me concern is that they may not have internal solutions (again, this is if you're of the mindset that Vitters won't become elite). Two names that would be instant upgrades and are currently being chirped about in trade talks are Padres third baseman Chase Headley and Indians catcher Carlos Santana.
Headley, in particular, excites me because they finally put up supreme offensive numbers for a third baseman in a ballpark that's brutal on hitters and with very little lineup protection around him. The Padres are known to put the clamps on their wallet, so would a small package of prospects headlined by Josh Vitters be enough to bring in the Cubs third baseman of the future? If the Cubs through in a mid-tier pitching prospect (the Pads always look for pitching, just look at the Mat Latos trade), they might keep Theo and Jed on the phone for a while.
Santana could be trickier because the Indians need to decide if they want to continue a rebuild with the interesting pieces they have or tear everything down and start over. Much like Headley, Santana has put up solid power numbers without much protection. He's got average defensive skills behind the plate and with only two full seasons under their belt, still has plenty of room to improve. The Indians are starved for pitching, so a trade involving one of their more promising prospects (Trey McNutt or Dylan Maples come to mind) could transform Santana into the Cubs new catcher.
With just those two trades, the Cubs would roll out a balanced lineup (Headley and Santana are both switch hitters) anchored by Starlin Castro, the asupervisorstioned Rizzo, Headley and Santana. Not a band young core. What's nice about this trade is that they wouldn't have to sacrifice Brett Jackson, or any of their other top-tier prospects. Trades like this don't come around often, so if they Cubs could make themselves better now and in three years, they definitely should jump on it.
Is Matt Garza a Cub or trade chip?
When you consider how much the Cubs gave up to acquire Garza from Tampa Bay, you should only assume he's here for the long haul. But looking closer, their numbers suggest that he's a number two starter, at best. In most situations, I would be fine with keeping Garza as a number two, but considering the Cubs' rebuilding endeavor, wouldn't it make more sense to try to build their value and flip them to a contender looking to add another quality arm for a playoff run?
It's the million dollar question (pun intended, because extending Garza could cost upwards of $100 million) – is Garza good enough to lead your pitching staff for the next half dozen years or would they be better served to add some depth to their collection of minor league pitchers? With examining what other similar pitchers are fetching on the open market, it'd be safe to assume that Garza will command anywhere from $14 to 18 million per season. What if that equates to a 6-year pact worth $108 million? Are they worth it? Garza is going to get some looks once the trade deadline looms, make no doubt about it. The Cubs need to make the right decision on the arms they have in house, because starting pitching is certainly this team's biggest question mark.
Continue to stockpile low-risk assets that can be flipped for prospects
Much like the Houston Rockets did to acquire James Harden, the Cubs need to continue their plan of solving their less-pressing issues with players looking to bounce back. The Dan Haren-for-Carlos Marmol swap would've been a slam dunk for the Cubs, but something must have raised a red flag for the Cubs to not acquire a guy who routinely pitched 200 innings and looked fantastic against the best competition in the majors. Despite the trade falling through, I can't help but think this is a precursor for the off-season – prey on players coming off injuries and guys unable to land multi-year deals.
Going into the season, the Cubs rotation is spearheaded by Garza, Samardzija and Wood (but not the Wood we knew and loved). Beyond that, it's an enormous hole. Arodys Vizcaino may earn a spot, but many speculate he'll land in the bullpen. Casey Coleman and Chris Rusin are fringe starters, at best. There are plenty of starters available with experience as quality innings eaters – Edwin Jackson, Jeremy Guthrie, Brandon McCarthy, Joe Blaton, among others, all who may struggle to get anything longer than a two-year pact. It's no secret that teams always scramble for quality pitching at the trade deadline, especially teams devastated with injuries. What if the Cubs make a run at two of them to fill out their rotation (I feel Jackson and Blanton would be the best fits) and are able to move them to add depth to the farm system? If the Cubs find themselves in a similar situation as 2011, it might be a fire sale with all their new acquisitions.
This off-season could transform into one of the most interesting and recent Cubs history. The minor league system is beginning to take shape. For the first time in what seems like forever, the Cubs have some fantastic young prospects with extremely high ceilings (Javier Baez, Albert Almora, Jorge Soler, etc). While pitching is still a question, facilitating some trades could help remedy that. What makes the Cubs upcoming season so exciting is that they finally have options. They have enough depth to make a large trade without leaving the cupboards bear. Would they turn down potential deals on guys like Santana and Headley? What exactly is Garza worth and is they a building block on a team with questionable starting pitching? And are the Cubs finally a club that free agents and players want to play for? If Cubs fans think that 2012 was an eye-opening year, 2013 might peel their heads back.

Lee Nguyen scored one goal and set another as the New England Revolution beat the Colorado Rapids 3-0 on Wednesday to end an eight-game Major League Soccer losing streak.
New England took its first lead in a match since 24 May when Nguyen's shot inside the box in the 10th minute deflected off Drew Moor for an own goal. Colorado's Thomas Piermayr was sent off for their second yellow card in the 74th minute, for a rough challenge just outside the box, and Nguyen's ensuing free-kick cleared the wall and landed in the upper right corner of the net. Four minutes later, Nguyen sent a pass for Kelyn Rowe to score.
Thierry Henry fired a shot into the lower right corner of the net in the 57th minute to help the New York Red Bulls to a 1-1 draw with Real Salt Lake. Real Salt Lake opened the scoring in the 18th minute with Joao Plata's goal.
At Washington, Eddie Johnson and Chris Rolfe scored to help DC United win a fourth straight game, 3-0 victory over Toronto FC.
Johnson opened the scoring for United in the eighth minute with their fourth goal of the season heading home a feed from Perry Kitchen. In the 59th minute, Nick DeLeon was tackled in the box but the referee allowed play to continue and Rolfe buried the loose ball behind goalkeeper Joe Bendik. DeLeon made it 3-0 in the 67th minute, though it went down as an own goal. They barreled through two tacklers and their shot deflected off defender Nick Hagglund.
The Vancouver Whitecaps drew 0-0 with the Chicago Fire. Vancouver's Erik Hurtado had the Whitecaps' best chance of the game in the 49th minute. They broke free of the defenders and cut to the centre of the box, but their right-footed effort was knocked aside by Sean Johnson.

Here you will find tips on collecting old magazines woven directly into detailed original histories of select publications. As the site continues to grow (est. Sept. 2005) you can come to expect pages about collecting old magazines by theme, cover artists and art, vintage magazine ads and much more.
This site features a detailed magazine grading guide, a resource page with links to various galleries of magazine cover images and checklists, and even a guide for both buyers and sellers telling how to best pack and ship your old magazines.
Everybody reads magazines and everybody has their own areas of interest. It's only natural that we would want to save back issues of copies that we especially enjoyed. Thankfully that's human nature and that's why there are so many old magazines available to us today. You may not consider yourself a collector, yet you may have a stack of back issues up on a shelf in your closet gathering dust. Guess what, you have yourself a collection.
Collections can creep up on you in many different ways.
My name is Cliff Aliperti and this is my site. I've been a collector (some says pack rat!) my entire life, starting with baseball cards as a kid and later as a business which I somehow turned into an online movie collectibles site and store. Old magazines have always seemed to be an important peripheral of any hobby I touched. My two main areas of expertise especially lend themselves to the crossover, as what Mickey Mantle collection is complete without a run of Sport Magazine back issues from the 1950's and 60's? And how can you collect anything movie related without eventually bumping into an old copy of Photoplay, Movie Story, or another of the old movie magazines?
The main purpose of this site is to examine some of my favorite vintage magazines in detail. I will provide a history of some of the more collectible publications and compose checklists whenever it is both relevant to the collector and possible to do so.
And you can also look for these features:
A history of the magazine business itself
A section on 19th Century American publications
Coverage of some of the international magazines that I'm familiar with
Examples of classic cover art and profiles of the artists who worked their magic on the old magazine covers
Vintage magazine ads — all about them and images of them
A detailed 10-point grading guide
What supplies you need to store and protect your collection
And even the best way to ship single or multiple copies of old magazines if you're looking to sell a few issues on eBay and make some money
I'm going to do my best to cover every area of collecting old magazines that I can think of…and then think of some more.
Now let's collect some old magazines…
After getting matched last year to an amazing Redditor, I didn't expect another Secret Santa so generous! The first of THREE boxes contained a book on learning shorthand; my Secret Santa paid attention! I will definitely put this to good use soon!
The second package contained a huge surprise- an Agent Mulder action figure with alien AND handy dandy flashlight! I am so blown away by this gift that I couldn't even believe there was a third package to open.
Inside that package was another piece of one of my TV favorites- a Breaking Bad "Los Pollos Hermanos" t-shirt! I'm sad my Santa didn't leave their name as I want to thank them from the very bottom of my heart for making this such a special and exciting Christmas. Thank you Santa!!!!

Early in January 2012, Suneet Singh Tuli, CEO of DataWind, a small computer company based in Montreal, told The Economic Times of India that advance orders for its 2500 rupee (about US $50) tablet computer had reached 1.4 million units in just two weeks—besting the record of Apple and its iPad. The tablet, dubbed the Aakash (Hindi for “sky”), had been promoted by the Indian government through a contract to DataWind as an ultralow-cost computer for the country's 1.2 billion citizens. We contacted IEEE Spectrum. Would it be interested in a review? Of course it would.
The tablet was released this past October. Also that month, Kapil Sibal, minister of human resources development in New Delhi, had announced in a press conference that around 10 000 samples were being given to students in various engineering institutes to test the functionality of the tablet.
The three of us set out to find a unit. After a fruitless week of calling around Delhi, we learned that the Indian Institute of Technology Rajasthan, in Jodhpur, had samples available.
So after an 11-hour train ride to Jodhpur, we were hospitably entertained by Prem Kalra, the director of IIT Rajasthan, and their colleagues. Kalra and their group had first conceived of the Aakash tablet, and they told us its history.
Inspired by the One Laptop Per Child project, in 2006 the Indian government opened bids for ultracheap computers to the premier technical institutes across India. Kalra, then teaching at IIT Kanpur, won the competition.
Kalra moved the project to Jodhpur in 2009 when they assumed the post of director of the new IIT there, and they continued to lead a small team to develop the tablet. Based on Kalra's plans, in early 2011 the Indian government contracted with DataWind to manufacture the tablet.
We were not allowed to take the tablet from the IIT campus, but we could use it there and meet the development team. So there we sat, with pens and paper, a camera, and scores of questions that two of the team's research engineers patiently answered.
Aakash-1 is a basic 7-inch tablet running Android 2.2 on a 366-megahertz Conexant processor with a microSD slot, two standard USB ports, an audio port and input jack, and a mere 256 megabytes of memory. It has Wi-Fi connectivity but no Bluetooth or cellular service.
The key word is basic—and painfully slow. Slower even than cheap mobile phones in India, which typically come with 699‑MHz processors. Its limited battery life—a maximum of 2.5 hours, which falls to 1 hour and 20 minutes with video or other applications running—is disappointing for a device that's supposed to be used in villages where access to electricity is sporadic at best.
And it's poorly built. The touch-screen cover was attached badly, making simple clicking difficult, to say nothing of push-and-drag sequences. The tablet heats up excessively after 45 minutes of use, and applications often hang. According to the engineers, the touch-screen cover frequently comes off while the tablet is being charged, because of the heat. Also, the tablet has no access to Android Market, which sells apps and media, so it will be difficult to upgrade software and service the product.

Such problems might be expected in a prototype. Unfortunately, DataWind raised higher expectations for the Aakash, in us, and evidently in the government as well.
A couple of days later, Kalra met again with one of us. Although constrained by confidentiality—he manages the contract with DataWind and is in charge of contracts for the next model—he clearly viewed the Aakash-1 as the first iteration of an eventually successful tablet. In fact, in their laboratory we saw prototypes of improved versions that will be the basis of the next round of contracts.
The obviously premature release of Aakash-1 and the attendant hyperbole has mired Kalra, the government, and DataWind in controversy. According to newspaper reports, it is unlikely that any more Aakash-1s will be produced, and the government is reportedly considering putting on hold a tablet-related letter of credit to DataWind.
Meanwhile, a tender has been prepared for a contract for an improved tablet, for which other vendors would compete along with DataWind, Kalra indicated. The company, for its part, is protesting what it feels are the tender's onerous performance standards. As this is being written, meetings are under way to resolve the issue.
Any major improvements in the tablet, let alone satisfying the reported water resistance and other requirements of the tender, will surely raise the selling price. Even assuming paper-thin profit margins, the price will go well above the target of $50 and will approach that of competing devices, such as the just-released $100 One Laptop Per Child XO-3 tablet, which has garnered favorable reviews.
Whatever the outcome of this dispute, Kalra remains passionate about using tablets to bridge the digital divide, so that “every last person, usually a woman,” can communicate, download educational material, send photos of themselves to physicians, file their taxes—all on this one device.
That would require a more competent tablet than the Aakash-1, not to mention electricity, Internet access, and service and repair capabilities. Ways must also be found for the impoverished and poorly educated people in the target audience to use the tablet to improve their lives.
The Aakash won't be in your local store anytime soon, and when it is it will probably cost a lot more than $50. Meanwhile, DataWind has announced a similarly configured commercial version called the Ubislate ($60), which will also include a cellphone. The company is accepting advance orders now.

Teen Rebellion Marks Subconscious Separation from Parents
CONTACT: Emily Gersema, 213/740-0252 gersema@usc.edu
The rebel has a cause.
Using brain scans, USC psychology researchers have found that teenage rebellion is a sign of teens separating from parents in their transition to adulthood.
The researchers believe this study is the first of its kind to record images of teenage brains as they responded to videos of peers and, separately, videos of their parents.
“The more they were activating a central part of the brain to the unfamiliar peer versus to their parents, the more risky the behavior was that they were reporting,” said Darby Saxbe, assistant professor of psychology at USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
For the study, researchers tracked the brain activity of 22 teens, ages 16 to 18, through Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The psychologists found that the MRIs of teens who reported engaging in the most risky behaviors — sex, drug use or reckless driving, for instance — were more responsive to watching videos of other teens than videos of their parents.
Researchers observed that when the rebellious teens saw the videos, a central region of their brains responded more to their peers than to their parents. In fact, the MRIs revealed a spike in activity in the precuneus — a portion of the brain that controls awareness about the thoughts and behaviors of others.
Although studies have shown that teens tend to hang out more with their peers than their parents as they reach adulthood, Saxbe said that parents shouldn't let their teens separate entirely. They said that the results seem to indicate that parents should be sure to maintain a strong bond with their children, even when they become adolescents.
Based on this study, the potential lesson for teens and their families is “Keep your friends close but your parents close, too,” Saxbe said.
The study was published this week in Social Neuroscience.
Defense Minister Ehud Barak's incompetence is no secret. Thursday's attacks along Israel's border with Sinai which killed eight people and wounded 35 is an example of Barak's inability to think ahead, even when they received specific warnings of imminent terrorist attacks from that area.
The collapse of Egypt's control of the Sinai, an open border with the Gaza Strip which allowed terrorists to infiltrate into Sinai, blowing up gas lines and attacks on Egyptian soldiers were obvious signs that security along Israel's border was at risk.
Op-Ed Israel's recycled politicians Avi Yesawich While Arabs shun their leaders, Israelis disturbingly content with status quo Israel's recycled politicians
Yet Barak did not adequately anticipate the threat to Israel and deploy intensive defense measures to secure the area. Instead of prioritizing a security fence and increased surveillance along the Egyptian border, they apparently relied on Egyptian efforts.
Allowing one or two thousand more Egyptian soldiers into a sea of lawlessness of an estimated 350,000 Bedouin is obviously inadequate. Why wasn't civilian traffic advised to avoid this isolated and dangerous area?
If a preemptive military operation in Sinai was cancelled due to a fear of infringing on Egyptian sovereignty than we are at the mercy of our enemies.
Killing the terrorists who attacked is not success; killing them before they attacked is.
Focused on Israeli concessions and withdrawals, however, Barak is surrounded by media advisors to promote their image. Yet no matter how hard they try, they continue to lead – backwards.
Barak advocated apologizing to Turkey for the first Gaza flotilla raid more than a year ago, in which IDF soldiers were injured and nine Turkish militants were killed. Since they were responsible for this botched operation, it's understandable that they would try to placate the Turks, regardless of the consequences.
Barak was also responsible for the IDF incursion into Gaza in 2009, along with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, and for the failure to bring captive soldier Gilad Shalit home at the end of that operation.
Promoting leftist agenda
If such failures were exceptions rather than the rule, or just minor mistakes, one might cut them some slack. But Barak is a serial blunderer with a history of defeatism, arrogance and faulty judgment.
Barak's failures to anticipate consequences are a matter of record:
As Prime Minister (1999-2001) they failed to acknowledge the threat of terrorism, or respond adequately. Instead of decisively putting down the violence that exploded after the failure of Camp David (2000), they wavered, along with then-Army Chief Mofaz. Symbolic of their policy of defeatism, they allowed an IDF soldier to bleed to death at Joseph's Tomb in Nablus, rather than rescue them from Arab mobs.
Barak's order to retreat from South Lebanon in 2000, amidst chaos and confusion, abandoning our allies in the South Lebanese Army, gave Hezbollah a victory and led to the war in 2006.
Barak was, of course, an enthusiastic supporter of former PM Sharon's unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Northern Samaria in 2005 – the "Disengagement" – which created the catastrophe we now face.
Barak's lack of military and strategic intelligence is matched by their economic incompetence. In 2000, as prime minister, they gave away Gaza's entire offshore gas and oil fields to Arafat without any reason, or condition. They have never explained this decision and this has never been investigated.
While turning over IDF bases and land to Arabs in Judea and Samaria, however, Barak is less generous to Israelis. They oppose turning over unused and under-utilized IDF bases (like Sde Dov) in order to build affordable housing.
Under their rule, the IDF has become more politicized, thus undermining the morale of soldiers. Despite serious legal and moral questions about the use of IDF soldiers in political, non-military and non-security related actions, such as evacuating and destroying Jewish communities, they promote their leftist agenda.
Despite socioeconomic protests that reflect the hardship that many Israelis experience, Barak refuses to offer a single concession to cut the bloated defense budget. Instead, they ask for more. This is not only obstinate; it's immoral.
While attacks from Hamas increase, Palestinian Arabs threaten a new wave of violence, Hezbollah rattles 50,000 missiles, and the Sinai is flooded with terrorists – can Israel rely on Barak's judgment?
"Barak objects to punishing PA for statehood bid," (Haaretz, Aug 11) leads one to question whose side they are on.
Prime Minister Netanyahu may want Barak for political reasons, but Israel cannot afford their recklessness. Minister and Major General (ret.) Moshe Ya'alon would be an appropriate replacement.

Ms. Rhee has not proposed abolishing tenure outright. Under their proposal, each teacher would choose between two compensation plans, one called green and the other red. Pay for teachers in the green plan would rise spectacularly, nearly doubling by 2010. But they would need to give up tenure for a year, after which they would need a principal's recommendation or face dismissal.
Teachers who choose the red plan would also get big pay increases but would lose seniority rights that allow them to bump more-junior teachers if their school closes or undergoes an overhaul. If they were not hired by another school, their only options would be early retirement, a buyout or eventual dismissal.
In an interview, Ms. Rhee said they considered tenure outmoded.
“Tenure is the holy grail of teacher unions,” they said, “but has no educational value for kids; it only benefits adults. If we can put veteran teachers who have tenure in a position where they don't have it, that would help us to radically increase our teacher quality. And maybe other districts would try it, too.”
Ms. Rhee has significant public backing for their efforts to improve this district of 46,000 students, one of the nation's worst-performing. Both presidential candidates lined up behind them in their final debate last month, with Senator Barack Obama calling them Washington's “wonderful new superintendent.”
Ms. Rhee, 38, has convinced Washington that they mean business since Mayor Adrian M. Fenty plucked them out of a nonprofit organization based in New York City , the New Teacher Project, and installed them in the chancellorship 17 months ago. They have fired or forced out hundreds of central office employees, principals and paraprofessionals, as well as 216 teachers who lacked licenses, their aides said.
“Fire all incompetent teachers — that makes a good sound bite,” said George Parker, the president of the Washington Teachers' Union. “But remember that not only teachers are to blame for the problems in this district.” Mr. Parker cited a chaotic administration that has had seven superintendents in a decade and has paid little attention to problems like truancy and student discipline. “You can't fire your way into a successful school system,” they said.
Mr. Parker said they had kept an open mind about Ms. Rhee's proposals, which would raise star teachers' salaries to $130,000, with bonuses, by 2010, and the two went together before several mass gatherings of teachers in July to explain them. But an August poll commissioned by the union found that teachers opposed Ms. Rhee's proposal by three to one.

In the interview, Ms. Rhee said the raises would be financed largely by foundations that had given them commitments of $75 million a year for five years, of which a “significant portion” would go for teacher compensation.
“The foundations want to fund things that are innovative and will have national ramifications,” they said. Ms. Rhee has declined to name the foundations, however, raising worries among some teachers about the foundations' motives and about whether their commitments would remain solid if the nation's financial crisis were to be prolonged.
The talks have made little progress in recent weeks.
“Students cannot wait for accountable teachers while adults argue,” Ms. Rhee said on Oct. 2, announcing that the district would seek to dismiss even tenured teachers deemed ineffective, partly by training principals to manage a little-used procedure that allows them to identify teachers for a 90-day mandatory improvement plan. Those who fail to demonstrate progress could face dismissal.
Mr. Parker responded by promising that the union would help teachers use all procedures available to protect their jobs.

“I'm willing to be flexible and to try out-of-the-box things to raise achievement,” they said, “but I'm not willing to move along this track that's just geared to busting the union.”
Of Mr. Parker, Ms. Rhee said, “We have a very good relationship — they drive me nuts.”
The two leaders appeared together on Oct. 23 at an awards ceremony, and Ms. Rhee said they spoke briefly about the negotiations.
“You're killing me,” Ms. Rhee said they told Mr. Parker in a joking exchange during the ceremony.
“No, you're killing me,” Mr. Parker responded, they said.
Ms. Rhee's relationship is less cordial with Randi Weingarten , the president of the United Federation of Teachers in New York and, also, since July, the American Federation of Teachers , which is helping Mr. Parker's local.

During Ms. Rhee's decade-long tenure at the New Teacher Project, their group operated programs for the New York schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein , and they helped them during negotiations with Ms. Weingarten in which Mr. Klein, too, initially attacked tenure and seniority rights.
Mr. Klein's 2003 assault on tenure did not prosper, but those negotiations eventually changed the seniority system so that principals are no longer required to accept teachers in schools that are not a good fit for them and teachers are not required to go to those schools. Both sides say the change has improved school staffing, and Ms. Rhee has proposed it for Washington.
In May, hundreds of people at a convention of educational entrepreneurs here watched spellbound as Ms. Weingarten, a commanding presence onstage, and Ms. Rhee, challenging them from the floor, clashed over what should happen to tenured teachers whom no schools hire.
Ms. Rhee's attitudes about teaching were forged in the 1990s in Baltimore , where they taught in an elementary school as a member of Teach for America , the nonprofit group that recruits college graduates to teach for two years in hard-to-staff schools, after which many leave for jobs in other professions.
“Michelle does not view teaching as a career,” Ms. Weingarten said in an interview. “She sees it as temporary, something a lot of newbies will work very hard at for a couple of years, and then if they leave, they leave, as opposed to professionals who get more seasoned.”
Teachers first won tenure rights across much of the United States early in the 20th century as a safeguard against patronage firings in big cities and interference by narrow-minded school boards in small towns, said Jeffrey Mirel, a professor of history and education at the University of Michigan .
“And the historical rationale remains good,” Dr. Mirel said, pointing to the case of a renowned high school biology teacher in Kansas who was forced to retire nine years ago because they refused to teach creationism.
“Without tenure,” Dr. Mirel said, “teachers can still face arbitrary firing because of religious views, or simply because of the highly politicized nature of American society.”

Ms. Rhee and Mr. Klein are hardly the first public officials to inveigh against tenure, but few have succeeded in weakening it. Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, persuaded Georgia lawmakers to repeal the state's teacher tenure law in 2000. But two years later, angry teachers helped elect Georgia's first Republican governor since Reconstruction, who promptly restored job protections for teachers.
Officials may have been most successful in abolishing tenure in Louisiana , where they had the help of a hurricane. Teachers in the Recovery School District, which was given control over many of New Orleans 's schools after Hurricane Katrina , serve at the will of the state superintendent, a spokesperson for the district, Siona LaFrance, said in an e-mail message.
Maggie Slye, 31, a former teacher in Teach for America who is a literacy coach in a Washington elementary school, said they liked Ms. Rhee's proposal because their salary would rise to $90,000 from $61,000 under the green plan.
“Isn't it funny? I don't even know if I have tenure,” said Ms. Slye, who taught in Boston last year. “To me, tenure is not a motivator; I motivate myself. It just doesn't mean a lot to me.”
By contrast, Kerry Sylvia, 38, said they opposed Ms. Rhee's proposal.
Although they are an award-winning world history teacher and works long hours to help students at their high school improve, Ms. Sylvia said that without tenure they would nevertheless feel vulnerable to arbitrary firing because they have publicly opposed some Rhee initiatives and speaks out about things like their school's decrepit heating system.
“Don't ask me to give up tenure, not even for a moment,” Ms. Sylvia said.

About 6 months ago, I wrote a post entitled 30 Amusing Dutch Words. It was shared, A LOT, so I guess you were mildly interested in it.
Laura Frame, my partner in crime for that post, has come up with some more cute illustrations of Dutch words. It would therefore be a shame not to share some more!!
This post shows you why it's a bad idea to directly translate Dutch words into English…
1. Eekhoorntjesbrood
Eekhoorntjesbrood – literally translated as ‘little squirrel's bread' it actually means porcini mushrooms. Leuk, hè?
2. Luipaard
Means leopard, but is literally translated as ‘lazy horse'.
3. Koevoet
This is the word for a crow bar, but the literal translation is ‘cow foot'. Tskkkkk.
4. Papegaaiduiker
Yuh huh, you got it – ‘parrot diver'. It actually means puffin.
5. Tuinslang
Continuing the animal theme… we have ‘garden snake' – which is actually just a garden hose.
6. Brandslang
And for real emergencies… a ‘fire snake'!! Ok, ok… it's really just a fire hose.
7. Gordeldier
Gordeldier means armadillo, but the literal translation is ‘belt animal' 😀
8. IJsbeer
The direct Dutch translation for polar bear is ‘ice bear'. (IJs can also mean ice cream! Even better!)
9. Paardenbloem
Crossing animal/flower genres, we have the ‘horse flower'. Which is actually a dandelion.
10. Madelief
Literally meaning ‘loveable maggot' – madelief is the word for a daisy.
11. Vingerhoedskruid
A foxglove is literally translated as ‘finger hat herb'. (Also an ideal candidate for a funny English word illustration!!)
12. Bloemlezing
‘Flower reading' is the way you say anthology in Dutch.
13. Pindakaas
Literally meaning ‘peanut cheese', pinkakaas is the word for peanut butter.
14. Toiletbril
Where did I put my toilet glasses??? ‘Toiletbril' means toilet seat!
15. Stofzuiger
‘Dust sucker'! Thankfully it means vacuum cleaner!!
16. Stembanden
Stembanden, meaning vocal chords. The literal translation is ‘voice tyres'.
17. Schoonmoeder
Definitely one of my person favourites!! Mother-in-law is literally translated as ‘clean mother'. Schoon can also mean beautiful.
18. Feestneus
Are you a ‘party nose'? You might be better known as a party animal.
19. Buitenbeentje
A misfit or ‘being an outsider' is literally translated from Dutch to English as a ‘ little outside leg'.
20. Brandweer
“Quick, call the fire weather!” Brandweer is the word for fire brigade…
(In this instance, weer comes from weren't which means to avert. So ‘Brandweer' means fire defence or fire aversion. And yes, that's a map of Belgium – the illustrator has ties with Belgium.)
If you have any more suggestions of amusing Dutch words for Laura to illustrate – please comment below! And if you want to give Laura some love (and congratulate them on their awesome drawings) here's their Facebook Page.
So, what have been your biggest fails so far whilst learning Dutch? (Or any language?) Ondernemer was a personal highlight of mine – I thought it meant undertaker, but it's actually entrepreneur!! Plus “Ik heb mijn benen uit.” Totally normal to say that in English, but in Dutch it would insinuate that I have prosthetic limbs. Oops!

"Art, particularly work focusing on heroic representations of bodily and sexual difference, will become a long-lost relic of the past," laments Del LaGrace Volcano.
The California-born gender-variant photographer, who's been living in Europe since 1982, is gearing up for a metaphorical homecoming of sorts: his/her first U.S. exhibition, which opens Sept. 19 at the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art in New York City. Curated by Jonathan David Katz and Julia Haas, "Del LaGrace Volcano: A Mid-Career Retrospective" aims to explore "identities, genders and desires" that exist beyond the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) spectrum.
Echoing the feel of Cindy Sherman, Volcano's colorful portraits and self-portraits "use the body and its signs of identification to play with and against assumptions about gender, sexuality, and the body," according to Katz and Haas. The stunning results range from a self-portrait in which a topless Volcano pairs a "Clockwork Orange"-style bowler hat with a lacy petticoat, to "Mo B Dick, Half & Half," featuring a gender-indeterminate model whose bespoke menswear gives way to a sequined bra and garters. (WARNING: accompanying slideshow contains nudity)
Calling "physiological sex is every bit as much of a cultural construct as gender," Volcano feels the time is right for the stateside debut of his/her work, given the divisive stance many Americans take when it comes to LGBT issues.
"The conversation about gender and sexuality in Europe...is astonishing in its radical difference to the U.S.," Volcano, whose work has been shown at the Ludwig Museum in Cologne, Germany and Amsterdam's Cobra Museum among other well-known art institutions throughout Europe. "While not always unproblematic, there seems to be a much greater willingness see and engage with lives outside the norm...the increasing power of corporate-sponsored, capital C conservatism [in the U.S.] may well succeed in its goals: to erase the few civil, social and human rights that we have managed to acquire."
Second-hand electronics retailer CeX will support Bitcoin for purchases and sales at all of its centrally-owned shops in the UK from Wednesday, which it claims is the largest adoption of the digital currency on the UK high street so far.
The company directly owns 30 shops and also grants franchises for around 170 more. Only those managed by the company itself will accept Bitcoin.
Those stores will also pay out out Bitcoin as a currency option when purchasing used devices from customers.
An iPhone 6 would cost 2.36 Bitcoin in a CeX store and if you were looking to sell your PS4, you could receive 0.86 Bitcoin from CeX in payment.
The move comes after a pilot project in Glasgow including the installation of Scotland's first Bitcoin ATM. A further five ATMs will be installed in shops around the country, although the company is yet to finalise which branches they will be placed in.
CeX will also hold Bitcoin at a central level, bucking the trend for retailers to immediately exchange their crypto-currency for US dollars or British pounds. Many businesses are put off by the volatility of the currency and aim to reduce their holdings as much as possible to minimise risk.
Through retaining its Bitcoin, CeX claims it is “responsibly supporting the stabilisation of the currency”.
David Butler, CeX commercial director, said: “For us, Bitcoin is not a passing fad but the beginning of a fundamental shift in the way people think about digital money.
“Our customers are always looking for new and engaging ideas and innovations and this attitude is not restricted to a new game or phone but also true of their approach to payment choices.”
Spring temperatures may not thaw the Chicago River before St. Patrick's Day weekend, but the water will flow green on March 15 nonetheless, event organizers said.
For more than 50 years, the river has been dyed green for Chicago's unique celebration of the Irish. Very little can stop that ritual, said Kevin Sherlock, an event organizer with the Chicago Journeymen Plumbers Local Union 130 that oversees the annual parade and river dyeing.
Recently, since the Chicago weather has been so cold that it's freezing the top of the River, fans of the celebration have been calling organizers concerned that the event could get canceled, Sherlock said.
“There's no need to worry,” Sherlock said. “The ice is never that thick that we can't break through it and make it work. They will get the water moving and get the dye in there. They have never had a problem before.”
Every year members of the same family that started the river dyeing custom use two boats to distribute dye in the water, Sherlock said. Four people in one boat dump in the color. The second boat helps spread the dye around. The process takes about half an hour and turns the dark water into a bright emerald green.
“We're getting a lot of questions about it,” Sherlock said. “People are concerned that it might not happen. Unless the river is frozen solid, they'll get the water moving and get it done. It will stay green for six to 10 hours.”
The river dyeing is scheduled to take place at 10 a.m., and coincides with the annual downtown parade, which steps off at noon and attracts about 250,000 revelers.

In the minds of most people, Mexico is usually seen as a beach resort destination or a corrupt narco-state run by drug lords. However, the majority of people don't know the truth about Mexico, its culture, and its people. Their opinion is based on stereotypes and bad press. As a result, they're scared to go to Mexico, but not many people actually know what is Mexico known for.
Here are 25 interesting facts about Mexico – a country that I definitely recommend to both visit and live in.
25 Interesting Facts About Mexico
1. Mexico's Real Name is Not Mexico
Mexico's real name is United States of Mexico (Estados Unidos Mexicanos). The country is divided into 31 states, plus the Federal District. Each state has its own laws, regulations, and police, similar to the United States of America. When in a different state from the one you live in, your phone is practically always roaming.
2. The Capital of Mexico Isn't Mexico City
The majority of people think that the capital of Mexico is Mexico City. However, that's only partially true. The actual capital is Distrito Federal (DF) – the Federal District.
It can be confusing because the Mexico City metropolitan area lies within DF and parts of the State of Mexico. However, only the inhabitants of DF can say they live in the capital.
3. Mexican Burritos Are Only Eaten in the North
Everyone seems to love Mexican food, so much so that it was recently classified as an irreplaceable part of the cultural heritage of humanity by UNESCO. Although, outside of Mexico what people refer to as “Mexican food” is more often than not actually Tex-Mex.
For example, in Mexico, nobody actually eats burritos Chipotle-style or filled with rice (I know that in northern Mexico burritos are popular, however, I meant burritos from US fast food chains).
Not only that, most authentic Mexican food is not very spicy or hot – it's actually sour due to a number of limes (in Spanish simply called lemons).
4. Mexican Phone Numbers are Complicated
For instance, let's say my cell-phone number in Mexico was 55 59 89 51 56. Now, if you're calling or texting from another cell phone you dial this exact number. If you call from a local phone you need to add (0-44) before the number.
If you text from a foreign cellphone you need to add (+52), however, if you want to call from a foreign number you need to add (+52 1).
5. Mexican Spanish isn't Like Any Other Spanish
As mentioned in my previous article on Mexican slang, Mexican Spanish is unique. For example, in Mexico torta doesn't mean cake, it means sandwich. Also, sope is not soup, but a so-called ‘Mexican pizza' (of course it's not an actual pizza, but it is similar to the concept of a pizza – dough, sauce, and toppings).
6. US citizens Are The Largest Immigration Group in Mexico.
It's no secret that Mexican citizens make up the largest proportion of the United States' foreign-born population. But the US citizens, on the other hand, constitute the largest immigrant group in Mexico. According to the 2010 Census, over 750,000 US citizens live in Mexico.
7. Mexico has 34 UNESCO world heritage sites.
Mexico's got 34 UNESCO sites within its borders. The list includes the historic centers of towns like Guanajuato, Mexico City and Puebla, as well as with dozens of ancient ruins, the agave fields of Tequila, and much more.
8. Mexico Isn't a Shithole Country
The term ‘third world' was invented during the Cold War as one of three geopolitical divisions of alignment. Countries aligned with the US were considered “first world”, those aligned with the Soviet Union were “ the second world”, and non-aligned countries were “ the third world”. Although the Cold War ended 25 years ago, the term “third world” became synonymous with poverty in colloquial speech while the other two terms disappeared.
If one were to rank countries by GDP per capita, Mexico lies somewhere between Turkey and Brazil. Like any developed state, it offers plenty of modern hotels, houses, and exclusive restaurants. On the other hand, the gap between poor and rich is quite big – while some households have a maid and a driver, most others don't even have enough to live on.
9. You Shouldn't Throw Toilet Paper in the Toilet
Mexico isn't different than other places in Central America in this sense, especially considering the fact that it's not in Central but North America. You should throw toilet paper in a bin, not in a toilet bowl. Not surprisingly, many Latin Americans abroad have trouble adjusting to flushing toilet paper down the toilet.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but none of the hostels I've stayed in around Mexico allowed me to flush down toilet paper. Especially in Riviera Maya which is so close to the ocean.
10. Mexico Has Women-Only Carriages in Metro and Buses
Despite the stereotype that Mexican women are constantly abused, women in Mexico are actually quite privileged. In Mexico City there are women-only buses and special sections for women on the subway.
Maybe for some people, this doesn't seem like much of a privilege, but let me give you the example of Turkey where women in public transport are constantly being abused and nobody is trying to protect them in any way.
The Turkish government hasn't even considered creating a special women-only section. Also, Mexican men are very caballerosos, meaning that they always open the door for women, pick them up before the date/meeting, and usually pay for everything.
Funnily enough, according to research conducted in Mexico City in 2013, it turns out that many women actually prefer to use the general section of the subway instead of the women-only one because men kindly give them a seat while other women don't.
11. Mexican Children Don't Receive Presents on Christmas Day
Don't worry, kids do receive gifts, and they might even get them twice. The bigger celebration, however, is on the day of Three Kings on January 6th.
12. Mexicans Don't Celebrate 5 de Mayo. Independence Day is on 16th of September
Mexico declared independence on September 27th 1821, but the beginning of the independence war was Sept 16th 1810 – the day that's celebrated as independence day.
Cinco de Mayo is not the Mexican Independence Day, it only commemorates the Battle of Puebla in 1862 when Mexico won against the French army. It's pretty much only celebrated in Puebla and by Mexican immigrants in the United States.
13. Mexico Has the Oldest University in North America
People usually think that since Mexico is a part of Latin America it's located in either South or Central America. But Mexico is actually a part of North America, along with the USA, Canada, and the Caribbean islands.
Therefore, Mexico has the oldest university in North America. The National University of Mexico (UNAM) was founded in 1551 by Charles V of Spain, 85 years before Harvard.
14. First Printing Press in North America is in Mexico City
The first printing press in North America was used in Mexico City in 1539 at the House of the First Printing Press in the Americas (Casa de la Primera Imprenta de América). Long before it was used in the United States.
15. Mexico City is Sinking Every Year
Mexico City has the highest elevation and is the oldest city in North America. But not only that. it's also built over the ruins of a great Aztec city Tenochtitlán on a lake.
However, unlike the Aztecs who created intricate systems of dikes and canals for flood control, the Spanish insisted on draining the lakebed once they got a taste of the work needed to maintain their watery existence.
As a result, Mexico City is sinking at a rate of 6 to 8 inches a year as pumps draw water out for the city's growing population.
16. Mexico Has World's Smallest Volcano
Mexico is in the middle of the “Ring of Fire”, also called circum-Pacific Belt. It's where almost 90% of the world's earthquakes and about 81 % of the planet's volcanic eruptions take place. It's the only place in the world where a rare rabbit called the volcano rabbit which lives near volcanos.
Mexico is also home to the world's smallest volcano – Cuexcomate. This volcano sits just outside the city of Puebla and stands a cute 43 feet tall, barely a small hill.
17. There Are Jaguars in Mexico
The largest wildcat in North America is the jaguar, which can be found in Mexico's southern jungles. They can also be seen hopping around Mayan ruins. Careful out there when you're wondering around cenotes!
18. A Mexican Inventor Created the World's First Birth Control
Luis Ernesto Miramontes Cardenas, a 25-year-old Mexican chemist came up with the chemical compound. They performed the first synthesis of norethisterone, which would go on to make up the main component of the first birth control pills in 1951.
19. Mexico is Home to World's Biggest Ancient Pyramids
The largest pyramid in the world is the Great Pyramid of Cholula in Mexico. It is also the largest monument ever constructed in the world, not the pyramids of Giza.
20. You Can't Shave and Drive in Mexico
In 2008 the Mexican city of Torreon imposed fines for putting on make-up or shaving with an electric razor while driving. Clearly, there were too many accidents on the road.
21. Color TV Was Invented in Mexico
Without Mexico, the world would be a lot more black and white for a long time. Guillermo González Camarena was an inventor who created the chromoscopic adapter for television equipment, which was an early color tv transmission system.
The fun fact is that they were only 17 and did it during WWII! Their first official color transmission was from Mexico City in 1946.
22. Yucatan Was Supposedly Named After a Confusion
The name of the Peninsula resulted from confusion between the Mayans and Spanish conquistadors. According to a local legend, one of the explorers asked a local about the name of the peninsula. They replied: Ma'anaatik ka t'ann, which means ‘I don't understand you'.
23. There are 59 Types of Corn in Mexico
When it comes to the meaning of words that describe corn Mexico is like the North Pole and the words for snow. However the corn, in general, is called maiz, but there are various words for corn in different forms. It's not surprising as Mexican corn comes in 59 varieties.
Mexicans have cultivated this important crop for centuries and despite threats from international trade agreements and genetically modified imports, farmers continue the tradition of growing corn, collecting seeds and preserving varieties for the next generations to come.
24. Caesar Salad Was Invented in Mexico
Legend has it that Italian-American restaurateur Caesar Cardini invented the salad in 1924 in Tijuana, Mexico. According to The Telegraph, Cardini owned a restaurant in the tourist destination to “attract Americans frustrated by Prohibition.
25. Mexico's Economy is Booming
Mexico is the 15th largest economy in the world and the 11th largest in terms of purchasing power parity according to the IMF. Some of Volkswagen's best-selling cars are partly produced in Mexico, and the country has become a new hotspot for research and development.

A bear naps in their cage at one of the traditional Chinese medicine company Guizhentang's controversial bear bile farms in Hui'an, southeast China's Fujian province on February 22, 2012. Bear bile has long been used in China to treat various health problems, despite skepticism over its effectiveness and outrage over the bile extraction process, which animal rights group say is excruciatingly painful for bears. CHINA OUT AFP PHOTO (Photo credit should read STR/AFP/Getty Images)
By Michael Martina
BEIJING, April 15 (Reuters) - An animal welfare group said on Tuesday it will save 130 bears from a bile extraction farm in China, its largest rescue so far, in a bid to end a business that has sparked outrage over animal cruelty amid growing opposition.
Hong Kong-based Animals Asia says as many as 10,000 bears are held in captivity in China and used for bile extraction, often under poor conditions that cause long-term physical and psychological suffering.
The bile, taken repeatedly from incisions in the bears' gall bladders, is used in some Chinese medicines that claim to cure eye and liver ailments.
Animals Asia reached a deal with state-owned Flower World to take over its bear bile farm in the southern Guangxi region's capital Nanning and convert it into a sanctuary for the Asiatic black bears, known as moon bears for a white crescent marking on their chests.
The deal was agreed to after company executives said they were losing money on the venture and acknowledged it was "time for change".
"Particularly in the last two years, there has been a lot of public discussion about the practice of extracting bear bile from live bears. Most people oppose it, so we consider prospects for the bear bile business will be less and less optimistic," Flower World General Manager Yan Shaohong told reporters.
"Actually, the company has always been investing money but not making any," Yan said.
The company had invested around 8 million yuan ($1.3 million) in the farm that had yet to sell bile. The rescue is set to begin in May and the company stopped extracting bile from the bears two years ago.
Animals Asia said they had put aside $5 million over the next three years to construct and run the sanctuary and retrain staff to care for the bears. Many had been used for their bile, while others had been held for breeding.
Wildlife advocates say that while sales of bear bile are legal in some Asian nations - including mainland China and Japan - any trade across borders is prohibited by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).
While the bear trade is robust across Asia, there are indications that attitudes are slowly changing.
In 2011, fury among Chinese Internet users erupted after news that a Chinese company that extracts bear bile hoped to list on the stock market. The firm eventually withdrew its public listing application, though it didn't give a reason.
Jill Robinson, Animals Asia founder and CEO, said many of the rescued bears, which can live as long as 30 years, will likely remain at the sanctuary for the rest of their lives.
At odds with President Donald Trump's concession that the accused perpetrator of New York City's deadly truck attack will not be tried at Guantanamo Bay, Attorney General Jeff Sessions boasted Thursday that the creaky war court remains open for business.
“Terrorists should know: this administration will use all lawful tools at our disposal, including prosecution in Article III courts and at Guantanamo Bay,” Sessions told a roomful of a law enforcement officials this morning.
“If anyone has any doubt about that, they can ask the more than 500 criminals whom the Department of Justice has convicted of terrorism-related offenses since 9/11,” they added. “And they can ask the dozens of enemy combatants in Guantanamo Bay.”
Among those enemy combatants are five men accused of plotting the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001.
With no trial date in sight for them, however, Trump walked back an earlier suggestion that the military commissions there could bring 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov to justice on this week's carnage.
“Would love to send the NYC terrorist to Guantanamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the Federal system,” Trump tweeted this morning.
“There is also something appropriate about keeping them in the home of the horrible crime they committed,” they added later. “Should move fast. DEATH PENALTY!”
Of the 61 people on federal death row, Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is the only one convicted of terrorism offenses. New York has had an effective moratorium on the death penalty for state crimes dating back to 2004, but there has been no execution here since 1963.
Trump's tweets came about an hour before Sessions delivered prepared remarks this morning in New York at the U.S. Attorney's Office, less than a mile from the West Side Highway bike path where eight were killed on Tuesday.
Federal pubic defender David Patton, who is representing Saipov against federal terrorism charges, has not responded to a request for comment.
Authorities say Saipov carried out their attack Tuesday with a flatbed truck rented from Home Depot. After crashing into a school bus, Saipov allegedly emerged from the truck brandishing two fake guns and shouting “Allahu Akbar,” an Arabic phrase meaning God is great.
Sessions paid tribute this morning to Ryan Nash, the police officer who has been credited with disarming Saipov on Tuesday with a shot to the abdomen.
“[Nash] is rightly regarded as a hero today — not just in New York, but across America,” Sessions said. “He symbolizes the best of the best.”
Refusing to take questions from the press, Sessions this morning laid out a hardline prescription for their theme of defending national security — a plan of action conspicuously withheld a month earlier when 58 people were killed in Las Vegas, without reference to the Islamic State group, at what became the country's deadliest mass shooting.
Sessions today called for boosting some of the most controversial facets from the national-security repertoire of the George W. Bush administration, programs that civil libertarians call illegality.
Other than loading up Guantanamo, whose prison camps former President Barack Obama failed to close, Sessions pushed for broad restrictions on immigration and what they described as the ability to “aggressively surveil noncitizen terrorists overseas.”
“The law that authorizes us to do this,” they noted, calling on Congress to reauthorize section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act once it expires in 59 days.
Sessions denied charges by the Electronic Frontier Foundation that the statute allows “backdoor” searches of U.S. citizens.
“I want to be clear about this: section 702 does not permit the targeting of any American anywhere, or even a foreigner who is likely in the United States,” Sessions said. “Congress needs to make sure that well-intentioned but misinformed amendments don't make it impossible to use the data we already have.”
The White House meanwhile has backed down on earlier tweets by Trump that cast political blame on Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for Tuesday's attack.
Referencing a “diversity visa lottery program” that Schumer backed in 1990, Trump quoted a guest from a Fox News program as saying Schumer was “helping to import Europes (sic) problems.”
Officials at Homeland Security Department have confirmed that Saipov immigrated under the diversity lottery program in 2010, but their country of origin, Uzbekistan, is actually in Asia.
Schumer meanwhile tried to eliminate the diversity lottery program four years ago, according to reports by several senators. The program provides some 50,000 visas every year to residents of countries with low rates of U.S. immigration, provided that the applicants have either a high school diploma or certain work experience.
Sessions also griped about the many federal court setbacks that the Justice Department has endured in trying to deny admission into the United States by Syrian refugees and residents of other various countries.President George H.W. Bush signed the bipartisan immigration bill that created the program, which Attorney General recommended replacing Thursday the system with a merit-based model like those used in Canada and Australia.
“The so-called ‘travel ban,'” Sessions said.
Veering off script, the remark was one of several ad-lib and observations that peppered Thursday's speech.
“I look forward to a victory in the Supreme Court,” Sessions predicted.
Notwithstanding Trump's new push to end the diversity visa program, however, no version of the travel ban would have prevented the immigration of Saipov, whom the United States granted lawful permanent resident status. Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic, is not currently a travel ban-listed country.
As Sessions delivered their remarks Thursday, a federal judge some 225 miles south in Washington heard arguments this morning about one of the long-term Guantanamo detainees whose trial Saipov is on track to far outpace.
Accused of masterminding the 2000 bombing of a U.S. warship off the coast of Yemen, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri's prosecution has been waylaid by the simultaneous resignations of the Marine general in charge of legal defense together with Nashiri's entire legal team.
The attorneys say that government spying on their communications with Nashiri has made it impossible for them to proceed, but a military judge found Brig. Gen. John Baker in contempt of court Wednesday for the refusing to represent Nashiri under those conditions.
U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth is presiding over Thursday's hearing in Washington.
Despite their defense of Guantanamo, which they previously called a “very fine place,” Sessions did not cite examples of successful cases there.

They finally arrived, on the very final day of 2013 for me having been pre-ordered in March of the same year. Delayed beyond their Masterpiece Datsun stablemates on account of their re-tooled shoulder design and for reasons of recreational Takara Tomy fan torture, MP-19 Masterpiece Smokescreen has landed to a tremendously mixed reception. MP-17 Prowl and MP-18 Streak set the bar immeasurably high for this mould in quick succession over a short period of time, so Smokescreen had to be exceptional to justify lasting awe and effect. Was he?
It would have been an almighty achievement for MP-19 Smokescreen to overshadow the release of Prowl and Streak, such was their allure, magnificent presentation and execution by Takara Tomy. But if anyone could stand out even more, it would surely be the unbelievably attractive Autobot Diversionary Tactician “Smokescreen” with their timeless red, white and blue colour scheme, echoing the 1982 Electramotive Datsun 280ZX Turbo #38 from the Fuji 6 hour, piloted by Don Devendorf and Tony Adamowicz.
Well there's not a lot wrong with the vehicle mode! Front splitter, rear wing, sponsorship decals, T-Bar roof, mirrors, a brilliantly faithful reproduction of the original Electramotive racer brought to life as a Masterpiece Transformer! Or wait, is it a spot-on homage to the original G1 or Diaclone toy? Nope, not quite, so it must be an animation accurate model. How about none of the above?
We can see it's not a precise rendition of the Fuji 1982 model – the only one to sport #38 instead of the more common #83 – as the photographs above show the racecar had no external mirrors, no T-Bar roof, flared rear wheel-arches and intake and slightly different air vents on the hood. Understandably Takara Tomy could not be expected to include all the original sponsorship logos like “Valvoline”, “Bosch”, “Electramotive”, “BM”, “Goodyear” and so on, but I was surprised at the omission of “Datsun” and “Nissan”, could we have had those for stickers?
However, cartoon Smokescreen and G1 Transformers Smokescreen never had those labels, so why should the Masterpiece? I must admit I am disappointed that they left the Streak/Prowl mould details like the T-Bar roof and mirrors on Smokescreen. I'm no whining fanboy though, I can justify the lack of alteration of such details from an economic and grand-scheme-of-things standpoint. I probably expected too much seeing the pains TT went to in order to create such accurate Lamborghini Countaches.
I am conscious of complaining or nitpicking too much, because a great deal about MP Smokescreen makes me feel as though we ought to be thankful for what we have gotten. While a 3rd repaint with a well-established persona was always on the cards to improve financial viability of a new Masterpiece mould and manufacturer licence, nothing in the world of Transformers is guaranteed. Smokescreen could have been overlooked.
We have him, though, and clever references to their diversionary tactician function and the G1 episode “The Gambler” where Smokescreen features heavily – their toy spotlight episode if you will – through the altered sponsorship details “Devcon Oil” (formerly Don Devendorf), “Slot Fever”(Goodyear), “Disturbance”(Valvoline) and “Smoke Tactics” (Electramotive) are greatly appreciated and an acceptable substitute. For the first time I would consider placing reproduction stickers on a Masterpiece toy, though, to recreate the racecar's original appearance.
As with all the previous Autobot cars from the Masterpiece line, Smokescreen can have their accessories attached in vehicle mode. This attack mode is something I am quite undecided about, it seems rather over the top but as I have mentioned in previous Masterpiece articles, when lined up alongside their friends, it makes some sort of sense. I just did not feel inspired enough to photograph it on this occasion. That does say a lot in this instance. The above photograph gives us our first glimpse of Smokescreen's unique launchers and the hood-mounted position as opposed to Streak and Prowl's Amazon exclusive launchers that attach to the rear bumper sides.
The mould is virtually flawless, we saw that clearly with MP-17 Prowl and MP-18 Streak. Posability and playability are immense, and the transformation is enjoyable, although with time I have decided that I marginally prefer that of Lambor, Alert and Tigertrack. I do however still appreciate the ingenuity of the Datsun design. Is Smokescreen animation accurate? Yes, they are. Is that a good thing? Read on.
 They are stunning, those colours are simply infallible, they look precisely as we would have hoped and imagined…right up until you reach the robot's head. What's wrong with the head, you say? Well nothing's wrong…and that's what's wrong!
We know that the new Masterpiece direction is heavily animation-based, and we also know that the G1 animation models are not exactly industry exemplars when it comes to detail, consistency or even beauty.
In a way, Takara Tomy have built themselves into a corner where they are almost obligated to produce Masterpiece Transformers as close to the cartoon model as possible in robot mode but at the same time, try to maintain as much vehicle accuracy (in the case of these Autobots) as possible, in keeping with the high-end pitching of the line. In the case of Prowl, Lambor and Streak – and by extension Soundwave, Starscream and Convoy – it was a revelation and an unrivaled success. With the season 2 designs being a little more blocky and seemingly less refined or detailed, this spelled potential trouble for Smokescreen.
Having said all of that, you know what? I absolutely adore G1 Smokescreen's animation model. That face is about as classic Autobot as it gets. It's so reminiscent of another favourite G1 head and face of mine; Mirage. Look at those launchers, Takara Tomy have recreated them absolutely perfectly. Their above appearance in Megatron's Master Plan is a series highlight for me because the G1 Smokescreen toy is by far and away my favourite of the Datsuns, and one of my all-time favourite G1 toys. Hell, it was my first Autobot car as a child. This one runs deep for me, I should have had absolutely no problem with either toy or cartoon accuracy being employed generously by Takara Tomy.
That face, that head-sculpt for MP Smokescreen has caused a noticeable dichotomy in the fandom. Unfortunately, I find myself in the camp that just cannot get comfortable with it. If I were to describe its precise details to you, you could say I have accurately described the animation model, but something's just off. Maybe it's the toy's permapout, the bruiser's nose, the slightly-too-long and jutting chin…I cannot place it, I just know they neither recreated the look of the toy nor the look of the cartoon.
The result brings my appreciation of this release crashing down, and I hate myself for it. I was very much hoping that having them in the flesh, I'd see what I had seen many times before, that online photographs just didn't do their face justice, and even though occasionally the light hits it in a way that brings out the cartoon likeness, it just wasn't the case.
Then again, it could be worse…
Seriously though, I do not think it is as simple as saying the cartoon head-sculpt was ugly, or too simple or without character or distinctive features, and therefore the toy has a dud head. The two shots from Megatron's Master Plan and the two images below show that they did have a unique look.
Their blue helmet was wider and more like a hood with, actually, really nice facial proportions. They had a good robot head, and and in my opinion Takara Tomy just failed to capture their essence. So I do not accept that because of Takara Tomy's decision to go primarily with ‘toon accuracy, fundamentally Smokescreen was always going to be less impressive than other Masterpiece toys. Where does that leave Smokescreen in relation to theirs bandmates?
I expected to like Smokescreen more than the other two Datsuns, I did in Generation 1, I did in Binaltech and were I to ever collect Classics, the Smokescreen would be my first choice. With regards to the Masterpiece version, I am still far too impressed with the incredible execution of Streak in both modes to give the crown to anyone else, and Prowl is exactly as you would want them to be, nailed in every respect considering the source material. My actual top 3 is the exact reverse of what I predicted.
Here are some community feelings on the MP-19 Smokescreen to demonstrate the spread of opinion:
“I prefer Smokescreen to Streak. While Bluestreak looks really good – he's almost too good in some respects, I don't think there's much that makes them stand out compared to Prowl's high contrast or Smokescreen's ‘Best of the 80s' scheme.”
“He looks like an arthritic old man who's trying to chase down the young whippersnappers who nicked their Zimmer.”
“I have to say, I think the only reason Smokescreen doesn't get as much love is because they came after Streak. That headsculpt/alt mode/paint job just pissed on Smokey's fire before it got lit. Can almost hear Smokescreen whispering to Streak across the shelf : ‘You stole my thunder you flash bastard!'“
“Smokescreen has taken a while to grow on me. I do like him. I just don't love him. I think the slavish efforts to have them as animation accurate as possible make them come across as more toy like than the other two Datsuns. That shouldn't even be a criticism as making toys out of the animation models is the MO of the line. It's an odd one as the mold itself is superb, but third time round the block I'm nitpicking with it.“
“I must be in the minority with them being my fave of the three. I honestly think Smokescreen will really shine when Reprolabels/Eness release an 80's sponsor set for him. With the big DATSUN across their front etc he'll look awesome…..er………..and the focus will be moved away from their accurate head.”
But how does Smokescreen hold up against other Smokescreens we've had? Surely they will claim the Best Smokescreen Transformers Toy Ever crown with ease?
It is genuinely not as straightforward as that. While their proportions and posability, technology and the nature of the accomplishment that is the Masterpiece Datsun 280Z-T are beyond reproach, I feel the G1 Smokescreen and the Binaltech Smokescreen (especially BT-07 GT) do more justice to their era, aesthetic and raison d'être than MP-19 does to his.
The G1 toy has a simple, repeatable and timeless transformation and is a diamond of their era. The Binaltech from 10 years ago was sponsor-laden, a credit to the world of licensed racecar Transformers that may never be surpassed in terms of significance, vision and impact upon release. It also has a most irritating transformation, especially back to vehicle mode, but it can be forgiven that. There is no doubt which Smokescreen stands out for me the most as the definitive representation that this character deserved as a racecar Transformer when kitted out and placed on my desk for display, and I can tell you they don't wear the number 38.
If I take the Binaltech out of the equation, and drop my highly unreasonable expectations of what I wanted from a Masterpiece Smokescreen – accepting the compromises in an accurate racecar context which is personal baggage – and then place them next to Diaclone and Mexican G1 variants…
…he is everything they need to be. A modern, updated and improved version of the G1 Smokescreen with noticeable nods to the cartoon version of the character. Looking at this final quote…
“It's totally accurate to the car but it makes a pretty car look like it's got joke-teeth and braces on them…Same for their “special” face and head sculpt. Accurate to a tee, but not very glamorous.”
…the fact that those two underlined statements are actually – in my opinion – not 100% true, is the crux of my personal lack of fulfillment when it comes to this release. But it's Smokescreen, and I suspect they will grow on me. I just wanted them to knock me dead out of the box.

A Greek tribunal has approved a U.S. request for the extradition of a Russian cybercrime suspect, the second such order made against a Russian citizen by a European court this week.
Both Moscow and Washington had been fighting over the extradition of Aleksandr Vinnik and other Russian citizens who have been caught up in a U.S. law enforcement dragnet targeting alleged cybercriminals around the world.
Russia has complained repeatedly about the detention of Russian citizens while traveling abroad, accusing U.S. officials of "kidnapping" them.
A three-judge court in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki ruled on October 4 that Vinnik, 37, should be sent to the United States, where authorities accuse them of running a multibillion-dollar digital money-laundering network.
Vinnik, who has denied the charges, was arrested while on vacation in Greece in July.
Russia, which also requested Vinnik's extradition, reacted quickly to the Greek decision.
"We are categorically against the extradition of our nationals to foreign countries, in this case to the U.S.," Deputy Foreign Minister Alexei Meshkov was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying.
Vinnik's lawyers were cited as saying they would not contest the Russian request, which will also be heard by a Greek court.
Other Arrests
A day earlier, a court in Spain authorized the extradition of Pyotr Levashov, who is accused by U.S. authorities of running a massive computer bot that sent tens of millions of spam e-mails over many years.
Levashov, 37, was arrested by Spanish police in Barcelona in April while they were vacationing with their family.
Russian news reports said Levashov's lawyers had three days to appeal the court decision.
Other Russians have been caught up in legal proceedings in European courts including Yevgeniy Nikulin, who is awaiting a decision by Czech justice officials on whether they will be sent to the United States or Russia to stand trial on similar computer-hacking charges.
Another Russian, Roman Seleznev, pleaded guilty earlier this month in U.S. court for participating in what U.S. authorities said was a cybertheft ring that allegedly stole over $50 million using hacked credit-card information. Seleznev was arrested in 2014 by U.S. agents as they tried to enter the Maldives on vacation.
The aggressive U.S. pursuit of hackers and alleged cybercriminals from Russia and elsewhere dates back several years.
Some of the hackers have been tied by U.S. intelligence to more politically motivated cybercrimes, possibly done at the behest of the Russian security agencies, such as the Federal Security Service (FSB).
Seleznev at one point bragged about their "protection" by the FSB's main cybercrime division, according to U.S. law enforcement documents filed in federal court.

Hey folks, after my little April Fools' joke, I imagine many of you are wondering what I'm actually doing for the next Shattered Pixel Dungeon update. The next update is still at least a couple of weeks off, so I thought it would be a good idea to start more publicly sharing what it is I'm working on! The next update is v0.6.0, and it's going to make some very big changes to how levels are generated.
I'm going to write two posts about these changes, to start with I'm going to explain some of the more technical changes, and in part 2 I'm going to show off some of the new features that will be coming in v0.6.0
Let's start with a simplified explanation of how levelgen currently works. The current algorithm takes what I like to call a ‘map first' approach to levelgen, where the general structure of a level is defined first, and then more specific details are filled in.
We start with a blank map, think of it like a big sheet of blank grid paper, with 32 by 32 squares. We then fill in a straight line of squares along either a row or column. The position we draw this line at is totally random, but we must leave at least 2 squares of width on each side. So now we have a grid with one line dividing it into two areas, we treat each of these areas like a new, smaller grid, and repeat the line drawing process for each of them. We keep doing this until we have no areas left that are larger than 8 by 8. We then also fill in all the squares around the edges. All of the empty squares that we have are the rooms of the level, and we now need to decide what types the rooms are, and how they are connected.
We randomly pick two rooms that aren't too close to each other to be the entrance and exit. We then trace two paths between the entrance and exit, through other currently unused rooms. These paths are both fairly straight, but appear snaky due to how the rooms were initially drawn, they can overlap but usually don't. We then randomly add a few short branches to these paths through other unused rooms. All the rooms that are part of these paths are used, and the rest are discarded.
There are three types of rooms: tunnel, standard, and special. Tunnel rooms are thin snaky paths between other rooms. Standard rooms are open with doors, and contain most of the regular enemies and loot. Special rooms contain unique enemies and special loot, and can only have one entrance which is often locked. Some of the rooms at the ends of branches are chosen to be special rooms, and all the other rooms are randomly either tunnel or standard rooms. Finally, we look at adjacent standard rooms, and will sometimes knock down the walls between them, which produce the game's larger, L and T shaped standard rooms.
I made a little gif to illustrate this process, you can also view the individual images here.
This algorithm produces a great variety of compact levels, but it has a few serious drawbacks. I used the term ‘map first' initially, and that approach leads to some restrictions because rooms themselves have very little control over how they are placed in a level. In my opinion, the starting point for levelgen should be the rooms themselves, meaning that a level decides what rooms it has first before coming up with how they're put together. As you might have guessed, I'm calling this approach ‘room first', and it has led me to completely redesign how levels are generated in ShatteredPD.
This new approach splits level generation into three phases, which I like to call Initialize, Build, and Paint. Each one is responsible for a different distinct part of generating a level. Initialize defines what rooms a level will have (minus tunnels), without any consideration for how big they are or how they'll be laid out. Rooms are able to specify what size range they can be, allowing specific rooms to be much larger than the previous algorithm's cap of 8x8. Rooms can define how they would like to connect with other rooms, including maximum or minimum connections, and denying connections on certain sides.
Build takes those rooms and defines exactly how they will be laid out to form a level, including connections and added tunnel rooms. Build is extremely flexible in that it works on free-form positioning rather than predefined lines along a grid. This also means that levels don't have to fit into a predetermined size, allowing for levels of all sorts of shapes. While this does make it more complicated to build levels well, it also allows for many more possibilities. Build algorithms are also interchangeable, so the same set of rooms can generate wildly different levels depending on which build algorithm is used.
Paint takes the now defined level structure and specifies the values of all the tiles on the level, meaning that the map is finished and ready to be filled with enemies and loot. Each room is responsible for painting its own contents, but can also specify which tiles the paint algorithm is allowed to make its own changes to. These changes take the form of grass, water, and traps currently.
Initially I'm working on getting everything functional and having it pretty closely emulate how levels are laid out already, but there is now so much more potential for cool new things. Look forward to the second post about 0.6.0 in the coming weeks, which will feature lots of information about new content that's taking advantage of these technical improvements. In the meantime though, here are a few simple examples that I've already got working:
Thanks to the more freeform layout, rooms can be as big as they like, here's a huge fissure room:
All sorts of layouts are possible, here's a level built with a thin snaky level builder:
Making huge levels is as easy as initializing with lots of rooms, here's that same snaky level builder with 5x the number of rooms (click for full resolution):

The conspiratorial son of our nation's National Security Advisor — whose social media behavior has created headaches for the administration before — took to their Twitter account to call the newest executive order a Muslim ban.
Of course, that is not how the President of the United States is phrasing it exactly; they told members of the media in the Oval Office Saturday, “It's not a Muslim ban, but we are totally prepared.” But that didn't stop Michael Flynn Jr. from tweeting out the following message:
Flynn is the son of General Michael Flynn, one of the most controversial picks by Trump early in their transition process, who is also known to dabble in the realms of the conspiratorial from time to time. Much of the brouhaha surrounding #PizzaGate (remember that?) stemmed from Flynn Jr., who fanned the flames of the absurd theory writing, “Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story,” in early December.
But the administration of President Donald Trump is not calling their executive order a ban on Muslims in any way, despite the most jarring campaign promise they made while running for President. POTUS continued Saturday, “It's working out very nicely. You see it in the airports, you see it all over. It's working out very nicely and we are going to have a very, very strict ban and we are going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.”
The executive order, signed at 4:42 p.m. EST on Friday afternoon, blocked entry into the United States for citizens from these seven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Somalia, Yemen, and Libya. Additionally, Syrian refugees are also suspended from entering the United States indefinitely, as well as other refugees for 120 days.
Although Flynn Jr. may seem like a bit part of a larger play unfolding, their actions have dogged the administration for months; after it was revealed that they have a transition email address, the Trump team was faced with endless questions about their role as a potential advisor to their father despite their personal questionable history on social media. Memorably, CNN's Jake Tapper corned then Vice President-elect Mike Pence on the issue, asking the former Indiana Governor the same question eight times about Flynn Jr.'s security clearance. The headlines off of that one interview alone were enough for the administration to take action and formally suspend Flynn Jr.'s email address, kicking them off of the Trump team altogether.

The Sony Xperia Z3 is special for many reasons. It has great specs, an awesome build quality and impressive resistance to the elements. There is one department where this device excels and goes unnoticed, though. It happens to have a magnificent screen, even if a 5.2-inch 1080p IPS panel sounds as average as it gets.
Much like megapixels don't necessarily translate to better photos, the Sony Xperia Z3 doesn't need 2K definition to make a good display. Sony is very careful with its screen technology. They offer vibrant colors and superior brightness, but what makes these panels special is that Sony manages to offer this vivid image without wasting battery.
How do they do that? Sony engineer Takao Yagi takes it to the Sony Mobile blog to explain to us how this is accomplished. They manage to save battery while offering optimal brightness by taking 3 steps:
A new “local adaptive contrast” algorithm has been introduced to the Xperia Z3. It analyzes every single pixel and optimizes its contrast individually. This increases the dynamic range without having to raise the backlight.
Sony also uses a technique in which they “shift phosphor material instead of cutting light by color filters”. This allows Sony to use “colder” whites (leaning towards the blue spectrum), which tend to look brighter.
More light-efficient LEDs are also used, which would be more of a hardware upgrade. Sadly, Sony doesn't go too deep into this section.
There are many reasons why having higher brightness can improve your experience. Sony states that memories and experiences create a bigger impression in us when perceived in brighter light. Not to mention, screens tend to look much nicer when bright, and outdoor reading is substantially improved.
The Sony Xperia Z3 definitely doesn't skimp out in this department, something you can clearly see in our hands-on post. We sure wish we could have a higher-definition screen in it, but do we really need it? The Xperia Z3 display is already great and it's better to be safe than sorry.
Dozens of low-income tenants in two hotels in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside are facing an uncertain future, as their new homes might soon be sold out from under them, CBC News has learned.
The owner of the Palace Hotel and Wonder Rooms has run into serious financial problems and their buildings are facing foreclosure. The hotels are owned by George Wolsey, who has battled with the city for years over building code violations.
In September, Wolsey agreed to hand over operations of the hotels to the Community Builders Group, a local non-profit organization. But now the nonprofit group believes that the receiver handling the case wants to evict the tenants.
Jerry Covington and Molly Maclellan, who share Room #2, had spent four years living on the street before getting a clean, warm and affordable room last month.
"Ever other place just treats you like an animal," said Covington. "We finally got a place that treats you like a human."
Made livable
The group has tried to get the building up to code, cleaned up rooms that were once unlivable and then moved dozens of tenants in, unaware of the financial challenge Wolsey faces.
"We had no idea this was close to receivership," said Julie Roberts, of Community Builders Benevolence Group.
Hotel owner George Wolsey has a history of battles with City Hall over their buildings. (CBC) "The receiver is talking about selling the building empty and evicting all 71 tenants and having an empty building in two months. And that obviously causes a lot of anxiety for our tenants who have nowhere else to go."
Sue Ouellette used to live in a studio apartment in East Vancouver, but it was too expensive.
Ouellette found a room at The Palace a few weeks ago and said the possibility of being evicted is terrifying.
"Not everybody makes a lot of money," said Ouellette. "There's people who do the grunt work that don't make a lot of money. They have to have a place to live too."
She's scared the building will be bought and turned into condos.
"If they keep taking housing like this away, where is everybody going to go? They're going to have tent cities again?"
The fate of the tenants could be decided as early as a foreclosure hearing Nov. 3.
Blocking and throttling Internet traffic will become illegal in the European Union following a parliamentary vote on Thursday.Members of the European Parliament voted to close loopholes in a proposed law that some believed would have created a two-tier Internet. The so-called Telecoms Package originally described "specialized services," which would have allowed ISPs to charge more for more data-intensive content services such as voice over IP and streaming video."After months of negotiations, the European Parliament has today adopted my proposal to close the last remaining loopholes in the text, in order to enshrine net neutrality in European law. Today's vote creates safeguards to ensure that players without deep pockets, such as start-ups, hospitals or universities, cannot be pushed out of the market as a result of deals between Internet service providers and content providers to offer faster services at a higher price," said Dutch Member of the European Parliament Marietje Schaake.
The package also abolishes roaming charges for mobile phone use in the EU, provides for more coordination of spectrum use and adds consumer protection such as plain language contracts and greater rights to switch providers or contracts.
Although many of these proposals were popular with the parliament, the most controversial issue was net neutrality. The final text approved on Thursday defines net neutrality as "the principle according to which all Internet traffic is treated equally, without discrimination, restriction or interference, independently of its sender, recipient, type, content, device, service or application."
So-called specialized services will still be possible, but only if the network capacity is sufficient to provide them in addition to normal Internet access services and they are not to the detriment of the availability or quality of internet access services.
However ETNO (the European Telecommunications Network Operators association) warned that the new wording introduced by the Parliament might result in restrictions of users' choice and harm EU businesses.
"The text approved today would introduce far-reaching restrictions on traffic management, which would make an efficient management of the network almost impossible, resulting in a lower quality internet for all," said an ETNO statement.
Mobile operators' trade group GSMA warned that the law might inhibit vendors' ability to invest and innovate.
"For mobile to fulfil its potential, network operators must be able to develop services that meet the needs of consumers and charge different prices for differentiated products," said Anne Bouverot, Director General, GSMA.
But digital rights campaigners welcomed the new rules. "Holding the open internet hostage in order to help a small number of companies would be dangerous and short-sighted. The freedom of the Internet must be protected," said Joe McNamee, Executive Director of European Digital Rights.
The new law must still be approved by the EU member states.
OTTAWA—Mississauga MP Eve Adams stands accused of abusing Conservative Party and Commons resources in their bid to grab a new seat; of insulting and bullying board members in the new riding, and of threatening the riding association's 2015 election plans. Yet it may be news of their December tantrum over a $6 car wash at an Ottawa gas station that will turn out to be their political career tipping point.

John Newcombe, a Conservative supporter and the owner of the Island Park Esso station in Ottawa's west end, said they contacted the Prime Minister's Office in January to complain about an incident with Adams in December 2013. Related: · Stephen Harper mum on Eve Adams controversy

According to Newcombe, Adams was upset about a car wash they felt was unsatisfactory, and parked directly in front of a pump lane at the busy station, backing up traffic behind it on a busy Ottawa street. Newcombe said the dispute centered on a thin layer of ice that remained on Adams' vehicle's rear bumper. “I have never experienced anything like this,” Newcombe, who has been in the business for 40 years, said in an interview Wednesday evening. “Ms. Adams just was adamant in refusing to communicate. It was the rolled up window, I'm staying put until I get my refund.” “And they said, ‘By the way, I'm timing how long it takes before I get my refund,' ” Newcombe told the Star's Alex Boutilier. Newcombe said after the incident they were visited by PMO staff, and Adams contacted them and apologized — an apology they felt was insincere. But after news of Adams' alleged bullying tactics in their bid for the Conservative nomination in the new Oakville North-Burlington riding, Newcombe said they decided to release security camera footage of the incident to The Canadian Press.
In an interview with CP, Adams disputes Newcombe's version of the events. They said they moved their car twice at the request of attendants before parking where they did, and that they regret the incident and portrayed it as a misunderstanding. “The entire time I simply said, look, if I could simply go through the wash a second time, or if not, could they kindly refund the unused car washes I had just bought moments ago,” Adams told CP.

Adams has also denied any inappropriate actions in their push for the Conservative nomination in Oakville North-Burlington. And yet, Prime Minister Stephen Harper has now ordered an investigation by the Conservative Party's national council into Adams' behavior, after receiving a damning letter of complaint by Mark Fedak, president of that riding association. It all comes just days after Harper fired Adams' fiancé Dimitri Soudas as executive director of the Conservative Party over meddling in the riding on their behalf, contrary to Soudas' employment contract. But Adams' immediate problem is the antagonism she's stirred up with members of the riding association of Oakville North-Burlington. A letter sent to Harper, senior party figures, and the Ontario Conservative caucus by Fedak outlines five allegations of improper behaviour in a nomination race that hasn't formally begun. The letter, obtained by the Star, specifically alleges that Adams: “Vetoed” the new riding association's pre-election plans to hire a private company to provide a poll-by-poll demographic map of the seat as part of its 2015 campaign strategy.
Improperly used their Commons mail-out privileges to send a “constant flow of mail” into the riding to solicit support, possibly “wasting taxpayers' money” for personal gain, if not violating Elections Canada rules for nomination races.
Improperly used the party's database known as CIMS to contact board members in a riding they do not yet represent.
Launched personal attacks against board members at a March 19 meeting, to which they aren't invited, and proceeded to “filibuster” despite nine requests to leave.
Was the real reason behind the dismissal of longtime regional organizer Wally Butts after Fedak asked Butts to intervene for the riding. Adams has said accounts of the meeting have been exaggerated by board members who support nomination bid by rival Natalia Lishchyna. As for the allegation about mail-outs, Adams and their campaign manager insist they have followed all the rules, and has verified with Elections Canada that the mailings were allowed. Fedak warned Adams' actions are hurting party morale and the Conservative brand, and may amount to violations of the party's constitution if not Elections Canada rules for nomination campaigns. In a statement, Harper's spokesperson Jason MacDonald said Harper “has asked National Council to review the letter and to follow up with the riding association.” “Until that review has happened we won't speculate about possible outcomes.” In an interview with the Star, Jeff Knoll, one of 14 members who signed Fedak's letter of complaint about Adams, said most on the Oakville executive felt they had nowhere else to turn but to the prime minister to rein Adams in. But they do not believe Adams should be prevented from running. Knoll said if it turns out that Adams was breaking Commons rules and using tax dollars inappropriately, it might be an argument to bar Adams' candidacy but stressed their goal was to level the playing field for all comers, including Lishchyna, whom they support. The allegations raise tough questions for a Conservative Party anxious to show it is running fair nomination contests for the 2015 election. That campaign will be run on a redrawn electoral map of 338 ridings, with the creation of 30 new ridings now forcing many MPs to seek new support within changed riding boundaries. It is the first time the party has not protected incumbent MPs in its 10-year history since the Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservatives merged. Adams represents Mississauga-Brampton South, but last year moved to Oakville with Soudas, their common-law partner. They want to run there instead. With files from Alex Boutilier, The Canadian Press

The unsettling horror book trilogy by Alvin Schwartz, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, inflicted chilling childhood scars for the '80s and '90s generation that, to this day, could easily reopen with a simple glimpse of the sickeningly surreal illustrations that graced the original releases by artist Stephen Gammell – controversially replaced in the 2011 reissue editions with art by Brett Helquist.
Consequently, we are on the verge of a Scary Stories comeback in the zeitgeist spotlight with reports from earlier this year that 20th Century Fox plans to develop a Scary story to Tell in the Dark film adaptation, having nabbed an appropriate directorial visionary in Guillermo del Toro (Crimson Peak, Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth), working off a script by John August (Dark Shadows, Big Fish).
While it's been some time since we've heard any updates on the project, we happen to be celebrating 31 Days of Halloween here at Blastr. Thus, we're taking the opportunity to look back on Schwartz's book trilogy – 1981's Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, 1984's More Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark and 1991's Scary Stories 3: More Tales to Chill Your Bones – to pick a suitably unlucky 13 of the scariest and/or ironically idiosyncratic stories that we'd like to see in the film.
Every day this month we're bringing you a different Top 13 list from the world of horror. You can find them all here.
Warning: Disturbing images from Stephen Gammell's original art awaits below!
In the 2009-10 campaign, the Penguins and the Panthers played into overtime or a shootout in three of their four meetings. Monday's game seemed destined to end that way, with the Panthers clawing their way back from a two-goal deficit to leave the teams tied at 2-2 halfway through the third period.
That is, until the recently recalled Chris Conner made their presence known.
The right winger's tally with 7:04 left in the final frame proved to be the game winner as the Penguins won the first game of their fifth annual 'Dad's Trip' over the Panthers, 3-2.
The Penguins had come out flying, scoring two power-play goals in the first period to jump to an early 2-0 lead. But the Panthers weren't ready to lie down, scoring with just 35 seconds left in the opening frame and tying the game midway through the second frame.
But strong, inspired play from the Penguins' third line of Chris Conner, Mark Letestu and Tyler Kennedy spurred the Penguins to victory, with Conner tallying off the rush with 6:56 to play in regulation.
Pittsburgh's third-period relentlessness was also aided by goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury, who continued their confident play that has seen them go 5-0-1 over their last six starts by making a few big saves late in the game.
Chris Conner
The strong play of the Penguins' third line of Chris Conner, Mark Letestu and Tyler Kennedy helped spur the Penguins to victory. Over the last few games, the trio has been using their speed and tenacity on the forecheck to bring energy and make plays, and their hard work paid off on Monday.
Since being called up from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, Conner has provided a spark for the Penguins in each of the six games they have spent with the Penguins this season, and Monday they were rewarded for their all-out hustle. They logged 10:57 of ice time and fired off three shots en route to scoring the game-winning goal – their first tally of the season – with 7:04 remaining in the third period.
Letestu started the rush that eventually resulted in Conner's winner, carrying the puck deep into the Panthers zone. While fending off a defender, they managed to hook a pass to Conner, who one-timed the puck past Vokoun from the bottom of the near circle.
The knives are out for Google Chairman Eric Schmidt. Within hours of making comments to UK media during a press conference, major US rightsholders attempted to brand Google as an arrogant, out-of-control company bent on ruining American creativity and thinking itself above US law.
The Guardian transcribed a few of Schmidt's remarks on Internet blacklists. "If there is a law that requires DNSes [Domain Name System operators] to do 'x' and it's passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President of the United States and we disagree with it then we would still fight it," they said at one point, apparently expressing opposition to the PROTECT IP Act recently introduced in the Senate. Any such system would be used as pretext for countries like China to engage in much more repressive website blocking.
That set off entertainment execs. Take it away, MPAA's Michael O'Leary:
Is Eric Schmidt really suggesting that if Congress passes a law and President Obama signs it, Google wouldn't follow it? As an American company respected around the world, it's unfortunate that, at least according to its executive chairperson's comments, Google seems to think it's above America's laws. We've heard this "but the law doesn't apply to me" argument before—but usually, it comes from content thieves, not a Fortune 500 company. Google should know better. And the notion that China would use a bi-partisan, narrowly tailored bill as a pretext for censorship is laughable, as Google knows, China does what China does.
The RIAA asked whether "the head of a multi-billion dollar leading American company [is] openly suggesting they would defy the will of Congress AND the President?" A spokesperson added, "This is baffling. As a legitimate company, Google has a responsibility to not benefit from criminal activity. In substance and spirit, this contradicts the recent testimony of Google's General Counsel that the company takes copyright theft seriously and was willing to step up to the plate in a cooperative and serious way."
And the Copyright Alliance, currently headed by a former top lawyer for Time Warner, said that Google might be trying to "scare off officials eager to defend American creativity and American jobs." Schmidt's remarks "smack of corporate imperialism, and—delivered across the Atlantic in London—are a far cry from the tone Google's General Counsel took while testifying back home in America before the House Judiciary Committee a mere six weeks ago."
That appearance, by Google's Ken Walker, was generally quite politic, though Walker did warn of "shakedowns" from private companies wanting to force changes in Google's behavior.
"Legislation should not include a private right of action that would invite suits by 'trolls' to extort settlements from intermediaries or sites who are making good faith efforts to comply with the law," they added at the time. The PROTECT IP Act does include such a private right of action, however—and it explicitly names search engines as intermediaries required to help more in the War on Piracy.
Beyond this, Walker refrained from the kind of tough talk in which Schmidt engaged, thus giving critics little to latch onto. But Schmidt's blunter remarks were a boon to Big Content, which suddenly got a welcome chance to go after a key opponent of many PROTECT IP Act provisions.
For Google, the specific controversy over "not following the law" is ridiculous; all sorts of groups "fight laws" that they don't agree with through court action, lobbying, and protest. But the company says it's quite serious about its free speech concerns.
"Of course we abide by the law in every country we do business," a spokesperson tells Ars. "We respect what the PROTECT IP Act is trying to accomplish and we're working closely with Congress to make sure the bill targets sites dedicated to piracy while protecting free expression and legitimate sites."
Episode 18 of The Drax Files Radio Hour features the third part of Draxtor's chats with Linden staffers. Alongside of this is an interview with one with Aleks Altberg (son of LL CEO Ebbe) and another with Karl Krantz, organiser of the Silicon Valley Virtual Reality Conference taking place on May 19th-20th.
As well as being available on the show's website and on Stitcher, the show is also on YouTube, and it is to that recording (embedded at the end of this article) any timestamps given in the text refer.
Brendan Iribe's “fireside chat” with TechCrunch co-editor Matthew Panzarino at the recent TechCrunch Disrupt New York event (May 5th-7th), pops-up in the early part of the show. During the chat (which I muse upon here), Iribe outlines a potential future for VR is a (very loosely defined, in terms of purpose and use) MMO / metaverse of virtual environments. This is not a vision that they see coming about in the next year or two – Iribe couches their frame of reference around a decade hence, at a time when they see VR / VWs having wider acceptance and the technology itself has had time to further mature (particularly some of the associated hardware) and become more broadly accepted in daily life.
Surprise is expressed in the show that SL seems to be “unknown” or “ignored” by Iribe and others. I don't think this is a valid assumption. Cory Ondrejka not only works at Facebook, but they were involved in the Oculus VR acquisition and he's hardly blind to Second Life, having co-founded it.
Rather I'd suggest the reason SL isn't mentioned comes down to something that appears to be missed in the discussion: the fact that Iribe is talking in terms of something a decade hence, and possibly something likely not built entirely by any single organisation, although FB is obviously well-placed to help build things. Perhaps more to the point, FB could position itself to provide core elements of the backbone – such as transaction services, identity services, and so on, thus becoming a gatekeeper to this new environment, much as Philip Rosedale wants to position High Fidelity in their vision of things.
As such, by the time the brave new digital world painted in Iribe's broad brushstrokes actually arrives, it will likely be something that is so beyond comparison with SL that the latter is not seen as having relevance in discussions. In this, it's not so much down to Iribe and others to point to SL and say, “look, this is the idea!” It is for SL to find wider relevance in the scheme of things.
The interview with Aleks Altberg commences at 16:18 into the show. A lot has been documented by Ebbe themselves about Alek's involvement in SL (perhaps first in this very blog in a comment they left just after starting at LL, then later during their VWBPE address), so it's good to hear from them first-hand about their experiences with the platform and their thoughts about it.
Aleks reveals it was their father who indirectly go them interested in SL after they found their Dad using it. From here, their tale is probably familiar to many SL users – passing the time flying around, exploring, meeting people and only gradually unlocking the deeper secrets of SL – object creation, building, and so on, over time, which in turn led them into scripting and thus into SL commerce.
In discussing getting more people engaged in SL, Aleks offers-up an interesting “five-step” plan, which includes basic control orientation and some initial content building. It's not a bad approach – but in some respects, it has been tried, albeit it not in quite the way they suggest, and hasn't always worked.
He's also less-than-convinced that trying to help people connect to things in SL which (might) interest them will work. They actually have a point – not everyone who comes to SL really knows what they're looking for. Equally, there is no guarantee that anything which may have enticed someone into SL becomes the reason for them to remain engaged in SL.
However, I'd still suggest that many who come to SL do so because they have heard of something or seen something which has piqued their interest, and so attempting to find the means to connect them to that interest / point of curiosity (and others similarly engaged), then letting them discover everything else over time, is potentially more beneficial than appearing to say, “here's all that SL can do – now go forth and do it!”, and shouldn't be completely dismissed.
Karl Krantz is interviewed at 26:12, where they discuss the SVVR conference and expo, which they admit to being an attempt to get the more affordable aspects of VR “away” from the gaming environment and open them out to more widespread interest / opportunities. The conference will take place at the Computer History Museum, Mountain View, California on May 19th / 20th.
Those in a position to attend can get $100 off the price of admission (reducing it to as little as $250) by using the code “drax2014″ (or indeed, “nwn2014″ if you are an NWN reader) when registering. They can then get to hear the likes of Palmer Luckey (Oculus VR), Philip Rosedale, Ebbe Altberg, David Holtz (Leap Motion), Ben Lang (Road to VR) and others.
Krantz is also no stranger to SL, and offers some interesting commentary on the platform – including the need for the Terms of Service to be redressed (which is being worked upon internally by the Lab). He's also very positive towards LL being able to position themselves to capitalise on any VR wave which may emerge, although their comments on the ToS and on issues of performance caveat this particular view somewhat.
More particularly, they suggest Linden Lab might be better served in moving away from being solely a platform provider and focusing on providing the core services – the transaction system and Linden Dollars, the identity management service, the marketplace, etc. and then opening the rest of the platform out for development and operation by others and folding-in OpenSim. Again, this is pretty similar to the High Fidelity approach, and it could have some merit to it; the problem being how the Lab pivots away from its current operating / revenue model to this kind of approach without actually hurting itself financially in the process or causing mass disruption to SL as it is operated today.
Enkidu Linden is an Engineer Manager for Platforms at the Lab, and Drax had the opportunity of interviewing them during the Santa Cruz meet-up, as we hear starting at the 34:38 mark. Aside from their work with the transactional elements of the platform, Enkidu reveals an interesting approach to how we relate to our avatars and express ourselves through our avatars.
Where many of us seek to build our avatar as – for want of a better term – a singular focal point of our identity in terms of looks, appearance, etc., and through while we can express ourselves, Enkidu comes from the opposite end of the spectrum, using many different avatar forms to express facets of their personality and interests. He's certainly not alone in doing this; I have a couple of friends who routinely shift their avatar form as a means of self-expression. Even so, it's and interesting reflection of the diverse ways in which we can define a means of identity and connection with others.
In terms of Lindens and their time in-world, Enkidu points-out that staff at the Lab, being geographically diverse in their locations (east and west coast, north and south), do spend time in-world attending various meetings in non-public regions and also spend time elsewhere (presumably using their Alts prior to Ebbe lifting the ban on staff using their “official” accounts for in-world roaming). In this, they note, “Our job is to make sure the people in Second Life can have the experiences they want to have. If we never have those experiences ourselves, how can we understand what they are?”
This is a wide-ranging discussion which tackles, or at least touches upon, a fair few areas. Those who have ever wanted to understand more about Linden Dollar transactions, the LindeX and exchange rates (and how the latter in particular keep the SL economy stable) would do well to listen to Enkidu's description – in totally none-technical terms – of how things flow together and the wheels turn.
As a former government employee, Enkidu offers some observations on our relationship with government and our relationship with the Lab, some of which indirectly echoed Ebbe's own Forum-made observation of the Dunning-Kruger effect which can shape some reactions to the Lab's flight attendantship of SL. it's an observation which is, at least sometimes and in certain ways, hard to dispute.
All told, another fascinating discussion with a Lab staffer, albeit one somewhat different to those in the last two shows.
Not much to say in summary this time around, other than the interviews are once again excellent.

A British company has announced its intention to launch a big constellation of Earth observation satellites.
A prototype spacecraft will go up later this year for testing, with the expectation that a further five platforms will follow in 2019.
Earth-i, based in Guildford, says its train of satellites will deliver rapid, high-resolution imagery of the planet in still and video formats.
At best resolution, these products will see features just under a metre across.
The video is promised in full colour. It could be used to track moving objects such as cars and other vehicles; or, if the scene is held fixed on a specific point, it would enable 3D models of the ground to be constructed.
Earth-i is already well established in the analytics business, processing and selling space pictures to a strong customer base. But this move, announced on the opening day of the biennial UK space conference in Manchester, would see the company operate its own satellites as well.

These platforms are the fruit of an R&D project coming out of Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL), also in Guildford.
The manufacturer has developed a new class of Earth observation spacecraft codenamed Carbonite.
The first in this series was built in just six months and was launched in 2015. The lessons learned from that experience were then applied to a second satellite which is now set to be the pathfinder in the Earth-i constellation.

"We worked on Carbonite-1 with SSTL and studied the performance to help develop the technology for Carbonite-2 which we will be calling EiX2," explained Richard Blain, the CEO of Earth-i.
"As for the constellation, we will launch that in batches of five. And in terms of the architecture, our baseline plan is for the first batch to go into one orbital plane, and then for the following batches to go into different planes, so that not only do we get high-frequency revisit to places on Earth but we also get to see places at different times of the day."
The total number of satellites in the constellation will depend on how the business for the pictures grows.

Earth-i is chasing a burgeoning market that is attracting new types of customers who are only now beginning to understand the potential of daily, fast-turn-around imagery.
So, for example, whereas governments have long made use of Earth observation (EO) data for mapping towns and cities, to plan major infrastructure ventures and to track land-use changes - the likes of the financial sector is really just beginning to appreciate the intelligence value of space pictures.
Those who trade in commodities are now gaining insights on supply chains, and on the activities at particular factories, ports, mines and oil fields; activities that all have financial implications.
And just as satellite-navigation data - knowing where things are positioned in the world - has become a mainstay of the smartphone applications revolution, there is a feeling that the exploitation of EO data in this domain has barely scratched the surface.
This was part of the motivation for the UK government last year committing more money than any other member state to the Earth observation programme of the European Space Agency (Esa). There are big economic opportunities coming.
"There is an almost insatiable demand for data from space as people are realising its true value to both their planning and daily operations," said Josef Aschbacher, director of Earth observation at the European Space Agency.
"Higher resolution image data from commercial organisations is likely to be very valuable either in its own right or when used in conjunction with other data sources including medium-resolution image data such as that provided under the European Copernicus Programme."
Image copyright 21AT / Earth-i Ltd Image caption The city of Bristol: Earth-i distributes pictures from SSTL's DMC3 satellites
Earth-i's constellation would be the first European system to provide HD video of activity on the ground.
Two North American companies have already started doing this - Urthecast of Canada, and US firm Terra Bella (recently acquired by Planet Labs).
Earth-i currently exploits the imagery coming from SSTL's DMC3 satellites. The capacity on this trio of spacecraft, which take 1m resolution pictures, is wholly leased by a Chinese concern called 21AT. Earth-i is the Beijing company's international distributor.
Richard Blain would not discuss the detail of the financing of the new constellation but said that a number of contracts were in place with SSTL.
"We are a well funded private company with a clear financial roadmap, supported by world class professional advisers and with a number of financial instruments at our disposal in order to ensure the continued successful deployment of our constellation following on from the next prototype satellite due for launch later this year," they told BBC News.

BADIN: Police recovered 46 bonded peasants, including women and children, after conducting raids on farmlands in Badin and Mirpurkhas districts on Wednesday.
A police team raided the farmland of Haji Ramazan Mallah near their village late on Wednesday night and got released 31 bonded peasants, including 12 children and 13 women, after one Kewal Kolhi filed an application in the Badin district and sessions court, appealing the court to rescue their family members from the captivity of the landlord.
The applicant said that the landlord had kept their family members in chains and deprived them of their just share in harvest for the past many years. Police said the liberated peasants would be produced in court on Thursday.
In Mirpurkhas, the district and sessions court on Wednesday set at liberty 15 peasants, including women and children, after recording their statements.
Jhuddo police had carried out raid on the farmland of Abdul Razzaque Leghari near Dajero Mori on Tuesday and recovered 15 peasants, including women and children, after one Sono Kolhi filed an application in the court, accusing the landlord of detaining their relatives at the farmland.
On Wednesday, police produced them in the court which recorded their statements and set them free.

Today, the cities of the Slavers. If you're following the TV series then you might be wondering why this part of the world merits a map all to itself, but all will become clear….
This is the second map with detail illustrations of the different cities. In this one we see the three ringed walls of Qarth and it's multi-coloured roofs, as well as a multitude of ruins – caused by the Red Waste, the Dothraki, or the blasted nightmare that is Valyria.
The Valyrian peninsula was particularly fun to draw. The brief called for a blasted wasteland of ash with spurting lava and a smoking sea – that actually smokes. The city of Valyria lies in ruins, and the paths of the old Dragon Roads (the die-straight roads forged by dragon fire) now lie beneath the waves in many places. This hints at the magnitude of the upheaval that destroyed this land.
We also get to see a bit more of some of the cities that become important in the later books – particularly the city of Volantis at the mouth of the Rhoyne. Volantis has a couple of key locations – including the Black Wall, the Temple of the Lord of Light and the Long Bridge, which show up in the city thumbnail.
But the key to this map is, of course, the Slavers and their cities. The cities of Meereen, Yunkai and Astapor get their own details, complete with the stepped pyramids and gladiatorial arenas. I have to say that having a map of the relative locations of the cities, the hills and mountains, and the river helped a lot when teasing out some of the events of the later books. I was also intrigued to see the Dragon Roads reaching so far to the East, implying that the reach of the Valyrians was long indeed, and that Meereen has it's own legacy with dragons.
As with the previous maps, the high resolution version of this map can be picked up in poster form on Amazon, along with the other 11 maps, for $2 a poster.
A few days after three Caps fans showed up to Maple Leaf Square in Toronto, two girls followed suit on Sunday. In a sea of blue, they were among a handful of Caps fans celebrating Marcus Johansson's series-ending overtime tally.
Video
The brave Caps fan, Kaitlyn Kilgour and Paige Riley, drove from Kitchener, Ontario, to support their favorite team on.
After the game, we spoke to an excited Kaitlyn about the experience.
Kaitlyn has been a Capitals fan since they were 11-years-old. Growing up in Ontario, they were a fan of their hometown junior OHL team, the Kitchener Rangers. Former Caps first-round pick Steve Eminger was their favorite player. Kaitlyn followed Eminger through their long journey in the Capitals organization, and fell in love with the NHL team in the process.
“I like rooting for the underdog,” Kilgour said. “My Mom and Dad let me cheer for whoever I wanted. And I chose Washington.”
Meanwhile, Kaitlyn became friends with Paige because they play hockey on the same team. Kaitlyn's favorite player is Ovechkin, but models their own play more after checking-line forwards Wilson and Winnik.
“I don't mind being the aggressor on the ice and drawing some penalties, or taking penalties to defend a teammate,” Kilgour said.
According to Kaitlyn, it was all Paige's idea to go watch the game at Maple Leaf Square.
“I said, ‘Absolutely!!'”
@russianmachine we made it into enemy territory pic.twitter.com/d0blQ4qaKD — kaitlyn kilgour (@kaitlyn_kilgour) April 23, 2017
“We went because we knew the atmosphere would be something to experience,” Kaitlyn continued. “We didn't have 400 to spend on a standing room ticket so we supported them as close as we could, outside with hundreds of Leafs fans.”
The two female fans even met up with a few other Caps fans including the guy with the RMNB sign.
Kaitlyn and Paige did have their uncomfortable moments with the crowd.
“We were boo'd by over 600 people,” Kaitlyn said. “We walked by with huge smiles on our faces. During the game we were yelled at, cursed at, but we made friends with the Leafs fans around us and had a good time. The Leafs fans had some interesting chants ‘#$%& Ovechkin, we want seven.'”
But that intensity calmed down after the game, as a lot of the Leafs fans went and shook their hands. Kaitlyn said they never once felt unsafe or targeted.
“We understood where we were and the jerseys we had on,” they said. “We took it all with a smile, and left with an even bigger smile.”
The video of Kaitlyn and Paige went semi-viral in hockey circles on social media and after the game, the Washington Nationals used it to congratulate the Caps for moving onto the second round.

What you're looking at here is the Grimsel, a tiny ball of electric fury built by students at AMZ Racing , an academic motorsport club set up by students from the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences. Designed to race in the International Formula Student championship, the machine has just set a world record for the fastest electric car to go from 0-100km/h (0-62mph). Just how quickly did it dispatch the benchmark sprint? 1.785 seconds, smashing the previous record of 2.134 seconds. Cripes.
Once you find out a little more about this car, that time is less surprising. For a start, the whole thing weighs just 168kg. That's not a lot of bulk to throw down a runway, particularly when you consider each wheel has its own 49bhp hub motor, each one made by AMZ.
The torque is the most impressive thing, though, as the Grimsel is able to lob out 1200lb ft. Clever traction control and torque vectoring systems ensure all that electric madness is transmitted to the road efficiently.
Impressed? You should be.
Local police are warning violent packs of teenagers are attacking and robbing people, seemingly at random. They're calling it "wilding" -- a dangerous trend that first made headlines more than 20 years ago.These attacks happened over the last few days in San Leandro on East 14th and Estabrook streets and near the Bayfair mall.This has been taking place every weekend for the past month and the Bayfair mall has been dealing with a lot of these problems, but it's starting to happen more often, including an incident that happened Monday afternoon."Yesterday, I was just driving down southbound on East 14th Street and all of a sudden a gang of juveniles, about 20 to 25, were kind of rowdy in the street, right in front of my car," business owner James Begier said.Begier was witnessing a mob of teenagers, surrounding a couple's car in front of the Pho Anh-Ha restaurant in San Leandro. Police caught two of them."One of the kids that we arrested tried to take a car from the victim, who had a baby in the car, so we arrested them for kidnapping," San Leandro Police Lt. Mike Sobek said.For the past month, San Leandro police say mobs of up to 150 teens and young adults come into the city, on BART, from around the Bay Area, and wreak havoc.On Saturday a mob chased two teens, from the Bay Fair BART station to the nearby mall, where they beat and robbed them.Police believe a YouTube video (warning: contains strong language) taken in Downtown Chicago last year, set off a trend called "wilding." They use social media to organize a flash mob that goes on a rampage."We have a city that we have to deal with, with other calls for service and if you have to babysit and continue to watch these juveniles as they're walking around, it takes up all our resources," Sobek said.This is happening all along the I-880 East Bay corridor, and now a group of cities is preparing to create a police task force to combat the problem.

When learning something new, almost everything seems impossible to understand and by the moment you feel like you finally got it, you realise there is much more to learn. Like my previous book Swift Programming from Scratch this book gives you the minimum possible snippets of information to gain the appropriate level of understanding at each point. The book gradually shows new concepts giving you time to practice each one of them and get comfortable using them.
The only assumption the book has is that you know how to code in Swift and that you understand basic Object Oriented Programming concepts. If you don't, then you can learn programming in Swift from Swift Programming from Scratch (book) and Object Oriented Programming in Swift (article).
Alongside the theory you will find various exercises and projects. Solving them will help you solidify what you learn. You will also learn how to use different tools that will help you make better apps and save you time.
The Tampa Bay Lightning will kick off the 2016 Eastern Conference Final against the Pittsburgh Penguins on at the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh.
The Tampa Bay Lightning found themselves in a rather comfortable position as they continued on their postseason journey. The Lightning had the pleasure of finishing off both their first round series against the Detroit Red Wings and their second round series against the New York Islanders in just five games each.
This would allow the Lightning the opportunity to not only heal up a little bit and attempt to get some of their injured players back in the lineup, but it gave the Bolts an opportunity to sit back and survey their potential opponents in the Eastern Conference Final.
The only question that remained was which team the Lightning would take on as they embarked on the next stage of their postseason journey. It was a long and hard-fought battle between captain Sidney Crosby and the Pittsburgh Penguins and captain Alex Ovechkin and the Washington Capitals. When the goal horn sounded to end the overtime period, it would be the Pittsburgh Penguins who would advance to the next round.
This means as the defending Eastern Conference Champion Tampa Bay Lightning head into their second straight visit to the Eastern Conference Final, they will go head to head with the Pittsburgh Penguins. There is no denying this is going to be the series to watch this postseason. There are some glaring similarities between these two teams, especially when it comes to their speed.
The Tampa Bay Lightning were able to defeat the Pittsburgh Penguins in all three meetings they had during the regular season. Unfortunately, as we all know, there is a rather large difference between the regular season and the Stanley Cup Playoffs. The time for excuses is over, and both teams will have to leave it all out on the ice if they want to emerge victoriously and move on to the 2016 Stanley Cup Final.
There is one question remaining. When do the Tampa Bay Lightning get down to business against the Pittsburgh Penguins? This is an excellent question. Thankfully, we have an answer for you. The Tampa Bay Lightning will charge into the Consol Energy Center for Game 1 of the 2016 Eastern Conference Final on Friday, May 13th at 8:00 p.m.
Here is a closer look at the upcoming schedule for the Tampa Bay Lightning and the Pittsburgh Penguins as they battle it out of the ice for Eastern Conference supremacy and the chance to defend the Eastern Conference in the 2016 Stanley Cup Final.
Date Visitor Home Time TV Listing Fri., May 13th Lightning Penguins 8:00 p.m. NBC Sports, CBC, TVAS Mon., May 16th Lightning Penguins 8:00 p.m. NBC Sports, CBC, TVAS Weds., May 18th Penguins Lightning 8:00 p.m. NBC Sports, CBC, TVAS Fri., May 20th Penguins Lightning 8:00 p.m. NBC Sports, CBC, TVAS Sun., May 22nd Lightning Penguins 8:00 p.m. NBC Sports, CBC, TVAS Tues., May 24th Penguins Lightning 8:00 p.m. NBC Sports, CBC, TVAS Thurs., May 26th Lightning Penguins 8:00 p.m. NBC Sports, CBC, TVAS
As we mentioned before, this is going to be an interesting series to watch. Both the Tampa Bay Lightning and the Pittsburgh Penguins have quite a few dangerous goal scorers and both teams have a lot of speed in their stride. If there is anything we can assure you about the Eastern Conference Final is you will never be bored.
The Tampa Bay Lightning have built a foundation of being able to overcome all manner of adversity you put in their way. Last season, this young team had a taste of what is means to play for the greatest trophy in all sports. The pain of losing to the Chicago Blackhawks and failing to achieve their dream has done nothing but fuel the fire in their souls to taste that same sweetness of victory once again.
If reports are true, Cowboys fans are going to have another reason to question whether or not the league is out to get them.
Randy Gregory deserves whatever punishment the league doles out for their drug test infractions. What the Cowboys don't deserve is having to wait until the week of preparing for their divisional playoff game to find out if Gregory will be suspended again. Per reports, Gregory's appeal hearing is set to take place after Wild Card weekend.
Stephen Jones on Randy Gregory: He'll have their appeal hearing .. in next week to 10 days, and then a final decision will be made. — Charean Williams (@NFLCharean) January 1, 2017
If Gregory loses the appeal hearing in any way, a suspension would be immediately enacted and their season would be over.
On Sunday, Cowboys defensive end Randy Gregory recorded their first career sack. In just their second game of the season, the second-year pro flashed an ability to use their speed and flex to work their way around one of the game's best left tackles in the Eagles Jason Peters. Gregory had been suspended the first 14 games of the season following multiple failed drug tests that saw them report to a rehabilitation program in August.
In fact, Gregory reportedly had been suspended a third time this season, for allegedly missing a drug test during the season. The penalty for this additional infraction was an entire season ban. Gregory has appealed that decision and league rules have the player eligible until the appeal hearing. The NFL has decided to hold the hearing following the Cowboys bye week.
The Cowboys are thin along the defensive line, but hope to get some players back as the team rests and waits to find out who their first playoff opponent's would be. DE Demarcus Lawrence missed the final three games of the season nursing a back injury. DE/DT Tyrone Crawford is nuring shoulder and hamstring injuries. Crawford is expected back, Lawrence is up in the air.
Dallas was led in sacks in 2016 by RFA signing Benson Mayowa with six. They and David Irving have come on over the last half of the season to wreak havoc on opposing offensive lines. Gregory's inclusion would have made a difference though, as they are a legitimate threat to use their speed and blow past tackles on any given play.
From one point of view, getting anything from Gregory this season was considered a bonus. Most wrote them off as being a non-factor, likely gone all of next year and questionable to ever wear a Cowboys uniform again.
From the other, it would feel like a bad tease to be able to see Gregory in two meaningless regular season games (Dallas clinched home-field before they faced Detroit in Week 16), but not have them for games that matter.
Regardless, the league has a firm policy on using marijuana and it was Gregory's actions that earned them the initial suspensions. The appeal hearing will determine if they once again ran afoul of the rules.
After nearly 14 years in limbo, an Earth-monitoring spacecraft built by NASA is finally set to fly.
The Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), scheduled to launch as soon as 29 January, will constantly observe Earth's sunlit side from a distance of 1.5 million kilometres. It will track daily weather patterns and seasonal vegetation changes, monitor atmospheric pollution and make the most precise measurements yet of how much energy Earth throws out into space — crucial data for the improvement of global climate models.
DSCOVR's resurrection is thanks to renewed interest in what was originally its secondary mission: monitoring space weather. From a point between the Sun and Earth at which the bodies' gravitational pulls cancel out, the probe will be able to detect approaching solar storms — bursts of charged particles and powerful radiation that pose a threat to astronauts, orbiting satellites and power grids on the ground. Such storms are of interest to the US Air Force, which is funding the satellite's launch, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which will operate it.
DSCOVR was the brainchild of former US vice-president Al Gore. They imagined a probe that would beam down a live image of Earth's illuminated side that could be available online. Just as the famous ‘blue marble' image of Earth taken by the Apollo 17 crew had inspired people, Gore said in 1998 that DSCOVR would “awaken a new generation to the environment and educate millions of children around the globe”.
To Gore's critics in Congress — particularly Republicans sceptical of their environmental advocacy — those were fighting words. The mission was nothing more than “a multi-million-dollar screen saver”, said representative Dave Weldon (Republican, Florida). It acquired the unflattering nickname ‘GoreSat'.
“The worst thing that can happen to science is to get mixed up in politics,” says Francisco Valero, a retired climate scientist who was at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, and led the satellite's original Earth-science team. “That is what happened to us.”
Although Gore intended the project to be mostly educational, NASA formulated a complementary science mission by soliciting proposals from the community. Valero's winning pitch was a probe to measure how much radiation Earth reflects back into space, a crucial variable for untangling the web of processes that influence the planet's climate. Clouds, for example, are a perennial conundrum for climate models because they both reflect incoming sunlight and trap outgoing heat. Valero proposed two instruments: a camera called EPIC to image clouds and other climate-influencing factors such as pollution, volcanic ash and seasonal vegetation; and a radiometer named NISTAR to measure the energy coming from Earth.
Current estimates of the planet's energy balance rely on stitching together strips of data from orbiting satellites, but DSCOVR will observe the entire sunlit side of Earth. It should reduce errors in estimates of Earth's radiation budget to 1.5% — a more-than-twofold improvement on present measures, says climate scientist Patrick Minnis of NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, who now leads this aspect of the mission. It will not be the final word, says Adam Szabo, the mission's project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, but DSCOVR will be a big help to climate simulations. And it will partly fulfil Gore's original vision by posting snapshots of Earth online every few hours.

Political science
Although it blew past its original US$50-million budget to roughly $100 million, DSCOVR was still built relatively quickly and cheaply. NASA completed construction in 2000, intending to launch the craft on the space shuttle.
In January 2001, George W. Bush became president after defeating Gore in a controversial election. Soon after, the mission was taken off NASA's shuttle flight manifest. The official reason was that construction of the chronically delayed and over-budget International Space Station required a higher priority.
But that did not stop speculation about political motives. ‘Who killed DSCOVR?' became something of a parlour game in space circles. Mitchell Anderson, a reporter for the climate website DeSmogBlog in Vancouver, Canada, cited an unnamed NASA source who said that Bush's vice-president Dick Cheney had given the order; others suggest that it was the president himself.
“The worst thing that can happen to science is to get mixed up in politics.”
In reality, the space shuttle's crowded launch schedule was the biggest obstacle, says Ghassem Asrar, who was the head of NASA's Earth-science division when the decision was made. But the project had become “tainted”, they add, preventing public support from privately sympathetic politicians and from NASA itself. “It would be dishonest to say the politics of climate science wasn't a factor. It was.”
In November 2001, with no launch slot in sight, Congress approved $1 million for DSCOVR to be put into storage at Goddard. And there it might have remained were it not for interest from space-weather forecasters at NOAA and in the Air Force. In 2008, they were looking to cheaply replace NASA's ageing Advanced Composition Explorer, which had been informing forecasts from the same spot in space that DSCOVR was supposed to occupy. In October that year, Congress ordered NASA to come up with a plan for DSCOVR's revival, and after a series of tests, it began funding NOAA to refurbish and operate the craft with $105 million over five years.
For Jay Herman, an atmospheric scientist at Goddard and EPIC instrument scientist, the delay has a silver lining: the refurbishment revealed a manufacturing defect in EPIC that would have let in stray light and potentially ruined its image of Earth. The delay allowed enough time to study the problem and correct for it. “So in some ways,” says Herman, “I'm very glad it did not fly 14 years ago. Because it might have been embarrassing.”
BlackBerry released its new Passport phone today, a keyboard smartphone with a 4.5-inch​ screen aimed at corporate users.
John Chen, charged with turning around Waterloo, Ont.-based BlackBerry since last November, has said the company's future rests on rebuilding its relations with the enterprise market, long a core of its business.
The Passport is on sale starting today, available only at Telus until Oct 1. Users will pay $200 for the phone on a two-year contract, which jumps to $250 starting Oct. 1.
Customers with Bell and Rogers can pre-order the phone, available for $249 with a two-year plan at Rogers and $299 with a two-year plan at Bell, and have it shipped on Oct 1.
Users who want to buy the phone without a contract will pay $699.
The new smartphone's hefty design — the size of a passport, or perhaps a suit pocket — has a screen that will show 60 characters across. That means spreadsheets, medical charts and other enterprise-friendly information will be readable.
The Passport specifications:
Screen is 1,440 x 1,440 pixels square, with 453 dots per inch, or DPI, resolution.
Gorilla glass screen.
QWERTY keyboard layout, a comfortable holdover from early BlackBerry designs.
BlackBerry Extra-loud speakerphone, 350 per cent louder than that of the Samsung Galaxy S5.
Device switch app that allows users to import data from other phones
Reported 30-hour battery life
Includes 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage space
13 megapixel rear camera with optical image stabilization
Rear camera has f2.0 lens and 1080p HD video recording that can shoot 60 frames per second
2 megapixel front camera with 720p HD video recording
"I have to tell you, I just fell in love with the phone when I came in," said Chen, who said it was mostly finished before they started with the company.
The phone also features a physical keyboard that doubles as a virtual keyboard — users can swipe the physical keyboard to add words onscreen while typing, or to move around a cursor on the screen.
CBC reporter Matthew Kang, who was at the Toronto launch, described it as a "hybrid of keyboard, mouse and touch screen."
Representatives from Bloomberg business news were also on hand to announce a Passport-specific app, available at the end of October, that will allow users to see an increased number of stock quotes at once.
Chen also confirmed that the BlackBerry Classic phone will be released by the end of the year, but wouldn't provide any more detail to reporters.
BlackBerry Blend
The company launched BlackBerry Blend, an app that syncs data across computers and mobile devices including smartphones and tablets, without needing a virtual private network. Not only does it sync across devices, but across operating systems.
A user can receive BBM notifications on a desktop computer running Windows, or share a file from an Android tablet, for example. It also allows users to sync with third-party online storage systems like DropBox, and works on Apple computers and tablets.
Blend isn't cloud computing system, however, as the files are natively stored on the Passport smartphone, which has 32 G of included storage.
Blend is available today in various app stores, including Apple's App Store, Google Play, Amazon Appstore and BlackBerry World.
Daniel Bader, a tech expert with MobileSyrup, calls the Passport a niche product very much geared to existing BlackBerry users within enterprises.
“This is not going to take the world by storm in terms of numbers. The Passport is the best way to showcase BlackBerry software and services — so blend is a big part of that,” they told CBC News.
They admired Passport's battery life and its new keyboard.
“It's made with stainless steel and curved glass, a very stark piece of technology — not elegant in the traditional way but ...it has its own sense of beauty,” they said.
Bader said Blend, the new cross-platform app, is the most intriguing new feature.
“It brings the BlackBerry out of the phone itself and into the computing ecosystem,” Bader said. “We can use it on an Android or IOS tablet or a Windows or Mac PC. You still have secure access to all your e-mails or text and the files that you want to share between those two devices without having to manual remove the files and risk losing them.”
Citi analyst Ehud Gelblum said BlackBerry is going after too small a target market.
“We expect this phone to appeal only to the high-end corporate executive market, which we estimate is quite small and being encroached on by others,” they said in a note to investors.”
They also are unimpressed by the ability to adapt Android apps to the BlackBerry – a necessity because fewer apps are being developed for BlackBerry.
“We believe the square shape of the screen could make the vast store of Android apps now available via the Amazon app store a disappointing experience as most were designed for a longer screen,” they said.
Chen says restructuring over
Chen told the crowd at the Toronto launch on Wednesday that the company's restructuring process is over and the company is focusing on growth. Chen is known for turning around Sybase in the 1990s.
BlackBerry's chief has made the manufacturing and supply chain more efficient and raised cash via the sale of the company's extensive real estate holdings.
But none of that counts unless they can create a portfolio of hardware and services that appeals to professional customers, and then start turning a profit.
The company reports on its earnings this Friday. BlackBerry stock was up on the release, trading at $11.81 at mid-afternoon.
Chen told the Wall Street Journal the Passport will go on sale in the United States at a no-contract price of $599 US, comparable with the iPhone or Samsung Galaxy S5. That's $100 less than in Canada.
AT&T will be the exclusive carrier in the U.S., according to Chen on Wednesday.
One key question is whether the company can leverage BlackBerry Blend independent of having a BlackBerry device, said Bob O'Donnell, president of Techanalysis Research.
“This is not an overnight turnaround by any stretch of the imagination. They've got a lot of hurdles to overcome,” they said in an interview with CBC's The Exchange with Amanda Lang.
O'Donnell says BlackBerry has to play up their security features.
The famed BlackBerry security remains an appealing selling point — it's hard to hack.
But equally important will be a raft of services to be released this fall to support the new phones.
A BlackBerry Enterprise Server 12 update is planned for November and is expected to introduce cloud storage before year-end. Also on the menu are apps designed for business use.
BlackBerry Passport's performance will be a test of Chen's strategy as well as an indication of the potential for the company as a whole.
Battlefield 4 won't include motion control support because the mechanics won't make the game better, despite "people throwing money" at developer DICE to include them, according to executive producer Patrick Bach.
Speaking with Edge Online, Bach said integrating next-generation motion control peripherals with the latest installment of its military shooter franchise is not in the plans. Bach suggested that other companies have been offering DICE compensation to provide support for "quirky control[s]" in Battlefield 4.
"We are not interested in things that don't make the game better," Bach said. "There are a lot of gimmicks — people throwing money at us — ‘can you implement support for this quirky control thing'. No, it doesn't make the game better."
Bach added that despite DICE's openness to new, innovative technology, there is "no point" in adding support for something that ultimately does not improve the game experience.
"Touch screens used to be a gimmick, because no-one could get it to work until iPhone came out and used it right," they said. "It adds to the experience, and now everyone is doing it. To us it's the same with motion control and perceptual gaming in general; if it adds, great. If it's a gimmick, ignore it."
Battlefield 4 was unveiled at GDC 2013 last month. Check out Polygon's coverage here.
To mark Canada Day on 1 July we asked readers what it's really like living in the country, how Canada is perceived from the outside and what improvements could still be made
‘I appreciate more about Canada the more I travel elsewhere' - Julienne Isaacs, Winnipeg, Manitoba
There's always an exception to the rule, but most Canadians are genuinely kind, open to difference and welcoming to strangers. We remember our roots and value the diversity of our communities.
In Winnipeg, we may have extremely cold weather in the winter, but there are so many ways to embrace it - skating on the frozen river under the stars, cross-country skiing, or attending the French-Canadian Festival du Voyageur in February, where you can admire world-class ice sculpture. And don't get me started about the summers, which are hot and beautiful. Exploring Manitoba's many lakes on canoe trips or while staying at a cabin for a weekend is the closest you'll ever get to pure happiness.
I think it's a bit funny sometimes how little a conception of Canada's vastness people seem to have. It's not very feasible for most Canadians to travel across the country, much less take skiing holidays at Banff all the time. There's a big disconnect between the tourist's version of Canada and the local communities most of us live in.

‘This is a very happy place to be day in, day out' - Gavin Schofield, Banff, Alberta
Living in Banff National Park and working as a bartender is something quite special. I will never tire of being surrounded by the jagged Rocky Mountains. There also seems to be a great acceptance of different cultures and that instills a real sense of community which enforces this ‘friendly identity' that Canadians are labelled with.A lot depends on the individual, but this is a very happy place to be day in and day out.
I'd like to see more positive changes in the near future stemming from the government in terms of the climate change and free movement debates. However, not a great deal needs or can be done to make Canada a more appealing place to live.

‘The first thing I do when I return home is lost myself in the nearest woods' - Jennie Wright, Ontario
There are two Canadas -one is the one-hundred-mile-wide strip on the southern border where 75% of the population lives, and the other is everywhere else. A couple of hours' drive brings southern Canadians into the vast areas so sparsely populated by the other 25%. Once out of that southern fringe, we can hike, canoe, snowshoe, snowmobile and ride through the rest of wild Canada without ever relying on motorways and public footpaths. I love travelling to the UK, but must admit that the fact that most land is privately owned makes me feel claustrophobic. The first thing I do when I return home is lost myself in the nearest woods.
But Canada has its fare share of problems too. The dismantling of a national housing program has resulted in skyrocketing homelessness. The proportion of the population relying on food banks and other forms of social assistance continues to climb. Grants for post-secondary education were abolished long ago and many students face poor job prospects and crippling debt. The aboriginal population continues to face discrimination and exploitation. Our armed forces have been redirected from peacekeeping missions to often misguided combat missions.
On the other hand, LGBTQ rights are among the strongest in the world. We can drive, cycle, and canoe from sea to sea. Our schools consistently rank as world-class, our cities are clean, and we're getting better at urban transportation and green technology. Many Canadians are bilingual or trilingual, and our culture is vibrant and dynamic.
As an elementary teacher in southern Ontario I always wish for more investment in public education. Public education, especially for special needs students, continues to come under attack across Canada. In Ontario most specialised elementary teaching positions like librarians, music and PE teachers were removed in the nineties. I would like to see our schools adequately funded and grants available again to low-income students who wish to pursue secondary studies.

‘There is always a place where anyone can feel at home' - Peter McClure, Edmonton, Alberta
It seems as if Canada is one of the few countries in then world that has consistently been accepting of new immigrants. Perhaps it's just because we have so much space, but I think that speaks to a feeling of “live and let live” and a rather relaxed, tolerant, and humanistic approach to life, that doesn't seem to be shared elsewhere in quite the same way. It might also be that we have so many environments within our country that we assume there is always a place where anyone can feel at home. Anyone who isn't content where they are can easily move to a place they find more exciting, or more peaceful, or more scenic.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Spotting some bald eagles on BC's coast, Tofino, a wonder secluded end of the road town Photograph: David Cook/GuardianWitness
It may be that some of that tolerance comes from the fact that the country was formed originally by combining two different cultures. There will always be a few who complain about how Quebec has too many rights, or how the English are taking over French culture, but at least no one starts panicking if they hear someone speaking another language.
The wilderness is all around and within easy reach. There are few Canadians who haven't been camping, and it is even said that a Canadian is someone who knows how to make love in a canoe. One thing that makes us unique is our familiarity with the outdoors, and it is certainly part of our national character.
Unfortunately, we are all too prone to identify ourselves in a negative way by comparing ourselves to our southern neighbour. It is too easy to say that “At least we don't carry guns” or “Thank goodness we don't have to worry about getting sick.” We are continuously bombarded by American media, and that means we often know more about their country than our own
I believe it is crucial that Canada take a good, long look at who we are and what we want to become as a country. Like the mouse who sleeps beside the elephant, we are at risk of having our culture accidentally crushed. It is the sheer ubiquity of American culture that threatens to overwhelm us, and while having the United States on hand as a role model to be rejected helps us understand how different we are, there is a growing tendency to believe that we are really just Americans, but with healthcare instead of guns.
‘Here I have space to think and breathe' - Dr. Beth Green, Hamilton
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Beth Green Photograph: Beth Green
I left a stressful academic job in the UK. Here I have space to think and breathe and start over working as a researcher. The grass always looks greener on the other side. I've been here just over a year and the first year was a massive adventure, the reality of the big move is bound to settle in come year two.
I do think Canada needs a better language to speak about immigration. Although it prides itself on welcoming immigrants, I'm conscious that it's easier for people like me who are white and educated. I think the immigration system them is under unprecedented strain and the cracks are beginning to show.
‘Canada's geography is both a blessing and a challenge' - Lucas Kilravey, Toronto, Ontario
While most other countries are ambivalent at best, Canada has largely embraced this dynamic of constantly changing pluralism as part of its identity. Canada is very unusual in the world in its relaxed, even positive, attitude toward very large numbers of immigrants. It seems that Canada is casually moving toward a very advanced stage of cosmopolitanism while much of the world is increasingly riven by nationalism. That seems, to me, rather unique. But as our population and economy grow, and our democracy matures in a unique direction, we need to more willing to lead by example instead of leaving the complicated problems to other countries.
Canada enjoys many benefits, both in terms of economics and security, by being so close to the United States. We benefit greatly from fluid access to the wealth and innovation of America's rather remarkable market and society.
Canada's geography is both a blessing and a challenge. Our low population over such a large territory gives rise to some quite objectionable provincialism. We must manage this by making internal travel more accessible and affordable. Internal airfares are such that, when I go on vacation, it is often cheaper to go to Europe than to fly to Vancouver. We also need to invest in high speed rail across the country. I hope PM Trudeau's infrastructure funding will be visionary in this regard.
Canada must address the legacy of genocide against the Aboriginal people. It is absolutely necessary to address the dissonance between the things about Canada that we value and the brutal way the Aboriginal people have been treated.

‘Canada is basically uninterested in nationalism, and that seems to make it much easier to work together' - Dan Donaldson, Elora, Ontario
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dan Donaldson, a 58 year old illustrator living in Elora, Ontario
Canada is the place where a truly multicultural society manages to feel completely normal. Europe is afflicted with a kind of uncomfortable accommodation that seems to be stuck at the point where they can start to question the dominance of traditional national groups. Canada is basically uninterested in nationalism, and that seems to make it much easier to work together in a way that minimises the sense of native-born privilege. And that in turn has made it easier to address the terrible failings in these areas, and in how brutally we've treated first nations people. We are deeply flawed, and have a history that we can't ignore, but I think we lack anxiety about opening that up for examination.
Politically Canada has committed to so many economically terrible policies over the past decade or two, and extricating ourselves is going to be a lot more complex than the glibness Justin Trudeau suggests. On the other hand, Canada is in many ways what it seems to be – civil, concerned with social good, the environment and minority rights. But we need to sort out our failed relationship with the environment. The fossil fuel energy sector has to go. We've shamed ourselves so terribly, but it has brought into focus how important the perspective of those who have remained connected to the land.

‘As an Indigenous person, I have a different view of Canada than many' - Ursa Minor, Winnipeg
I agree that Canada is a nice place given how much land there is and how scattered the people are across that vast landscape. But as an Indigenous person, I have a different view of Canada than many. More than 75 per cent of Canadians live within 100 kilometres of the USA border. The country uses Indigenous communities to hold on to much of its land, while begrudging the existence and cost of those communities. Nobody says that English people practicing English language and law in England equals “special status”. However, many Canadians insist First Nations' request for our traditional languages and laws in our communities represents “special status”.
I believe one of the challenges ahead for Canada is improving the lives of Indigenous people and giving them access to their land. There are a number of places in Canada where Indigenous communities still do not have basic infrastructure. Canada needs to provide this for every community within its borders.

‘Being able to explore untamed wilderness is a tremendous gift' - Heather, Kingston, Ontario
We are a pretty easy-going country most of the time. I think that shows to the outside world. Canadians have amazing access to wild places. Living in Ontario I can drive 3 hours from my house and be on a lake in a huge protected wilderness area with no one in sight. I can hear wolves howling from my tent and come across moose and bears from the relative safety of my canoe. Being able to camp and explore untamed wilderness is a tremendous gift and a huge part of Canadian life for me.
I'd like to see some thought and effort towards planning multi-generational cities and communities. We have allowed a huge amount of urban sprawl in Ontario, with great swaths of land taken over by car-accessed suburbs with single family homes. I think we just always believed that the space could handle it, but it's been a mistake. I would love to see more high density housing, where communities all coexist.
‘We have our own thing happening now' - Claire Cameron, Toronto
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Claire Cameron is a writer from Toronto
Toronto is an ugly city in many ways. It's a patchwork of converted houses, glass skyscrapers, overhead wires, and construction sites. There is so much building going, it's often said that Toronto has more high-rise buildings under construction than any other city in North America. I often don't recognise a corner that I stood on just a month before.
And that is also exactly why Toronto is successful. The architecture bends and buckles under the demands of the people who are here. We regularly smash down iconic places that have outlived their usefulness. While we lack any true visual coherence, we gain flexibility and a willingness to change.
I grew up in Toronto the 1970s and 80s when it wasn't such a diverse city. Now 47 % of us have a mother tongue in a language other than English or French, 47 % report themselves as being part of a visible minority, and half of the population was born outside of Canada. The changes are thrilling. This is a vibrant and growing city that feels completely alive because of all the people with different tastes, wants, and ideas who have chosen to come.
My only criticism of Canada is that we could cut our mental colonial ties and stop trying to be like the US or the UK. We have our own thing happening now!

Last week it came to our attention that the phrase "blast off" was coined—not in a purely scientific context, but a science fictional one—by E. E. Smith, an early science fiction author often referred to as "the father of space opera." The term appeared in Smith's 1937 story Galactic Patrol, when one character inquires of another, "How long do you figure it'll be before it's safe for us to blast off?"
And it turns out blast off isn't the only scientific word or phrase with science fictional origins; here is a list of nine more, originally composed by Jeff Prucher—editor for the Oxford English Dictionary's Science Fiction Project and author of the Hugo Award—winning Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction—for the Oxford University Press Blog.

9. Robotics
This is probably the most well-known of these, since Isaac Asimov [for those poor souls who have never gazed upon Asimov's awe-inspiring sideburns, that's them pictured up top] is famous for (among many other things) their three laws of robotics. Even so, I include it because it is one of the only actual sciences to have been first named in a science fiction story ("Liar!", 1941). Asimov also named the related occupation (roboticist) and the adjective robotic.
8. Genetic engineering
The other science that received its name from a science fiction story, in this case Jack Williamson's novel Dragon's Island, which was coincidentally published in the same year as "Liar!" The occupation of genetic engineer took a few more years to be named, this time by Poul Anderson.
Advertisement
7. Zero-gravity/zero-g
A defining feature of life in outer space (sans artificial gravity, of course). The first known use of "zero-gravity" is from Jack Binder (better known for their work as an artist) in 1938, and actually refers to the gravityless state of the center of the Earth's core. Arthur C. Clarke gave us "zero-g" in their 1952 novel Islands in the Sky.
Advertisement
6. Deep space
One of the other defining features of outer space is its essential emptiness. In science fiction, this phrase most commonly refers to a region of empty space between stars or that is remote from the home world. E. E. "Doc" Smith seems to have coined this phrase in 1934. The more common use in the sciences refers to the region of space outside of the Earth's atmosphere.
5. Ion drive
An ion drive is a type of spaceship engine that creates propulsion by emitting charged particles in the direction opposite of the one you want to travel. The earliest citation in Brave New Words is again from Jack Williamson ("The Equalizer", 1947). A number of spacecraft have used this technology, beginning in the 1970s.
Advertisement
4. Pressure suit
A suit that maintains a stable pressure around its occupant; useful in both space exploration and high-altitude flights. This is another one from the fertile mind of E. E. Smith. Curiously, their pressure suits were furred, an innovation not, alas, replicated by NASA.
3. Virus
Computer virus, that is. Dave Gerrold (of "The Trouble With Tribbles" fame) was apparently the first to make the verbal analogy between biological viruses and self-replicating computer programs, in their 1972 story "When Harlie Was One."
Advertisement
2. Worm
Another type of self-replicating computer program. So named by John Brunner in their 1975 novel Shockwave Rider.
Advertisement
1. Gas giant
A large planet, like Jupiter or Neptune, that is composed largely of gaseous material. The first known use of this term is from a story ("Solar Plexus") by James Blish; the odd thing about it is that it was first used in a reprint of the story, eleven years after the story was first published. Whether this is because Blish conceived of the term in the intervening years or read it somewhere else, or whether it was in the original manuscript and got edited out is impossible to say at this point.

Startups Pitch Cricket Flour As The Best Protein You Could Eat
Enlarge this image toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR
If you heard crickets chirping in your backyard, would it occur to you to grind them into a powder to mix into a protein shake?
That could become the next foraging trend if several edible insect companies can convince consumers that pulverized crickets are the next "it" protein.
"Insects are probably the most sustainable form of protein we have on Earth," Bitty Foods founder Megan Miller, who spoke passionately about eating bugs at a TEDx Manhattan event earlier this year, tells The Salt. "The only real barrier to Americans eating insects is a cultural taboo."
For $20, Bitty is peddling a blend of powdered crickets and gluten-free starches for baking, as well as cookies made with the flour. It joins Exo, a company with a line of cacao and peanut butter-and-jelly flavored protein bars made with cricket powder, and Six Foods, which has baked chips made with cricket flour in the works, in the new marketplace of insect-fortified food products.
Lots of people are excited about the potential of edible insects. A 2013 report from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization noted that insects like crickets, mealworms and grasshoppers are nutritional powerhouses, high in protein, fat and the essential amino acids lysine and tryptophan, which are scarce in cereal proteins like soy. Insects also can be farmed on far less land and emit fewer greenhouse gases than traditional livestock.
At 12.9 grams of protein per 100 grams, crickets have about half the protein of chicken and beef, which each contain about 25 grams of protein per 100 grams of meat, according to data from Iowa State University and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. (The edible cricket companies like to emphasize that if you're talking about the percentage of protein in dried beef versus dried cricket, crickets win by 22 percent.)
Exo Co-CEOs Gabi Lewis and Greg Sewitz hopped into the edible insect market as Lewis was pondering turning their homemade protein bars into a business. Unsure how to compete with other bars, the two decided to try adding crickets, which Sewitz says they had recently discovered after attending a conference on climate change.
Sewitz and Lewis, now based in Brooklyn, ordered several thousand live crickets off the Internet to be delivered to their house at Brown University. They roasted the crickets in the oven, "like nuts or any sort of meat," Sewitz says, and threw them into the food processor.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Bitty Courtesy of Bitty
The result –– a powder Sewitz refers to as "cricket flour" –– was incorporated into the bars as a substitute for plain protein powder made from soy.
Exo bars contain between 270 and 300 calories and 40 crickets' worth of powder. It's a slightly sweet and filling bar — we found that it kept us sated for several hours. They're going for $36 for a 12-pack, or $32 for a monthly subscription.
The cricket farming business appears to be growing in North America. Bitty Foods sources its crickets from farms in Ohio, Georgia, central California and Montreal, Canada, with another farm set to open in Minneapolis. The crickets in Exo's bars are raised for human consumption and fed an organic grain mixture, Sewitz says.
But Miller says cricket flour is a confusing misnomer, often used interchangeably for ground crickets, which, when used alone, are not a functional baking ingredient.
"We found that people didn't really understand that you can't really throw powdered crickets in with some butter and sugar and make a cookie," they say. "It's going to be disgusting."
Exo and Bitty Foods are both trying to target young, health-conscious individuals, who may follow a gluten-free or Paleo-style diet.
"The [person] we're going after as an early adopter — someone who cares about fitness and nutrition and [who] cares about the food they're putting in their body," Sewitz says.
Miller says that their company has found a surprisingly strong following among a peculiar demographic –– moms.
"There's a need among moms who want to get more protein in their kids' diets, but it can be hard to feed them things like a steak," they say. "If you can give them foods that are appealing, like a cookie [with cricket flour] that's actually more akin to an energy bar, that's magic for moms."

New White House chief of staff John Kelly reportedly called former FBI Director James Comey in May to express their anger over how President Trump handled their firing, according to CNN.
Two sources familiar with the conversation said that Kelly told Comey they were even considering resigning over how Trump treated the former FBI director.

"John was angry and hurt by what they saw and the way [Comey] was treated," one of the sources told CNN.
Comey reportedly talked with Kelly over the phone while traveling back from Los Angeles, where they learned of their firing from television news reports while speaking to employees at an FBI field office.
The two sources told CNN that Comey and Kelly had a professional relationship and deeply respected each other, but were not close friends.
Trump dismissed former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus on Friday and replaced them with Kelly.
“Reince is a good man. John Kelly will do a fantastic job. Gen. Kelly has been a star, done an incredible job thus far, respected by everybody. He's a great, great American,” Trump said.

Ted Cruz today was apparently unable to get through a thirty-minute rant about what a liar Donald Trump is without telling a lie of their own. If it wasn't a lie, then it was either a very bad mistake, or a demonstration of intimate knowledge of Donald Trump's penis—no real way to say.
Cruz is currently campaigning desperately through Indiana, where they are polling poorly, and their campaign stops have featured swarms of angry protesters. This morning, they reached a boiling point, holding a press conference lambasting Donald Trump as an amoral narcissist and a pathological liar. Which is fair!
But then Cruz said this: (Emphasis ours.)
Donald Trump is a serial philanderer and they boast about it. I want everyone to think about your teen aged kids. The President of the United States talks about how great it is to commit adultery, how proud they are. [He] describes their battle with venereal disease as their own personal Vietnam. That's a quote, by the way, on the Howard Stern show. Do you want to spend the next five years with your kids bragging about infidelity? Now what do they do? They do the same projection, just like a pathological liar. They accuse everyone about lying.
Pretty damning, if true. But Donald Trump never said they had a “battle with venereal disease,” and what Cruz said is not, in fact, a quote Trump made on the Howard Stern show.
Trump did, in a 2004 appearance, make a comment about dating and Vietnam. But the entire point of their comment was to insist that they never caught an STD, in part because they had their personal physician check their dates beforehand.
“You know, I'll tell you, it's amazing, I can't even believe it. I've been so lucky in terms of that whole world,” Trump said, when Stern asked if it was awkward to have their potential dates screened. “It is a dangerous world out there—it's scary, like Vietnam. Sort of like the Vietnam era.”
“It is your personal Vietnam, isn't it?” Stern said. “It is, you've said it many times.”
So Cruz got the keywords right, but mangled the message, and in doing so falsely claimed that Donald Trump admitted to having sexually transmitted diseases.
When you're losing an election to someone who has successfully painted you as a liar—not to mention someone who wants to “open up” libel laws—you should probably be more careful in your recollection of their past statements.
WATE web staff - NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) - There is a total of 133 new laws or amendments to laws that will take effect in Tennessee on July 1. Here's a run down so you know what's coming.

The Improvement Act cuts taxes on food, but raises prices on gas and registration in order to pay for road and bridge funding.
The tax on a gallon of gas is going up by 4 cents on July 1, and then 1 cent each of the following two years, adding up to 6 cents total. The tax on diesel fuel is going up by a total of 10 cents over the next three years.
The cost to register a vehicle in Tennessee will increase by $5 for passenger motor vehicles, $10 for buses and taxis and $20 for semis and tractor trailers. Electric vehicles will have an additional $100 registration fee.

The Tennessee Hearing Protection Act of 2017 lets people use silencers on guns in Tennessee. Supporters said the measure will help protect sportsmen's ears.
Legislation was also passed that allows people who can legally have loaded or unloaded guns and ammunition to bring them on their boats. Proponents have said the bill brings more clarity to the current law.

Ask any Tennessee public school teacher how much money they spend on students out of their own pockets and you'll always hear at least "several hundred dollars" and many times "as much as a thousand."
Currently, $200 is set aside for every public teacher in K-12 for instructional supplies. The $200 is divided with $100 given to each teacher for instructional supplies as determined necessary by the teacher and $100 being pooled with all such teachers in a school and spent as determined by a committee of the teachers for such purpose.
A new law increases removes the requirement that half of the funds be pooled and instead allocates the entire amount to each teacher for instructional supplies as determined necessary by the teacher.
4. Blocking a public street is a crime
Copyright by WKRN - All rights reserved
A traffic safety bill makes blocking public highways and streets in an area that restricts emergency vehicle access a misdemeanor. The offense is punishable by a fine of $200.
The law could impact protestors who stand in the street and restrict emergency vehicles.
5. Tougher rules for public employees who commit crimes while on the job

An amendment is making it more difficult for public employees accused of a misdemeanor offense during their employment to avoid punishment. Currently, employees can file for suspended prosecution or pretrial diversion.
Suspended prosecution allows the case to be put on hold for six months. After the conclusion of six months, the case could be dismissed if there were no other similar offenses during the six months.
A pretrial diversion is a voluntary program for defendants charged with misdemeanors or criminal violations. When a defendant successfully completes the program, a recommendation is made to the court to dismiss the charges.
The new law makes it so that public employees who commit misdemeanor offenses during their employment do not qualify for suspended prosecution or pretrial diversion.
6. Fines for voter fraud
Copyright by WKRN - All rights reserved (WOOD file)
An amendment to Tennessee's election laws requires a court to impose an additional $1,000 fine for a conviction for voter fraud. It also provides a $1,000 reward for information leading to a conviction of voter fraud.

Caller ID lets consumers avoid unwanted phone calls by displaying caller names and phone numbers, but the caller ID feature is sometimes manipulated by "spoofers" who masquerade as representatives of banks, creditors, insurance companies, or even the government.
An amendment is adding tougher punishment for those manipulating caller identification or text messages. It makes "spoofing" a Class A misdemeanor.
8. Increased sentencing for people who target police or military
Copyright by WKRN - All rights reserved
People convicted of committing a violent offense against a uniformed law enforcement officer or uniformed member of the military or national guard where the victim was selected because of their occupation will face tougher sentencing. An amendment to a sentencing law allows the defendant's sentence to be increased.

A new law bans abortions in Tennessee after 20 weeks if a doctor determines the fetus is viable through required tests. The legislation that subjects doctors to felony penalties doesn't apply if the mother faces risks of death or serious damage to a major bodily function.
10. Homeowner's associations can't restrict how you display the American flag
Copyright by WKRN - All rights reserved
Under a new law that takes effect July 1, 2017 a homeowner's association can't enforce rules that prohibit displaying the flag of the United State of America or an official or replica flag of any branch of the United States armed forces on the property owner's property.
11. Purple paint is now a no trespassing sign
Copyright by WKRN - All rights reserved
Property owners can now use purple paint on trees or posts as an alternative to posting "no trespassing" signs. The property owner must post at least one sign at a major point that specifies that the use of purple paint signifies "no trespassing."
12. Yearly armed intruder drills in schools
Copyright by WKRN - All rights reserved
Tennessee school safety teams are required to conduct at least one-armed intruder drill each year.
13. Desecrating a place of worship or burial is now a felony

Headlines Don't Give Full Story of American Craft Brewing
July 27, 2016
Craft beer is losing its shine — at least that's what you would have thought if you only glanced at some of the clickbait headlines after this week's mid-year report from the Brewers Association (BA), the not-for-profit trade association dedicated to small and independent American brewers, as well as CraftBeer.com's parent organization.
If you only digested the negative headlines or gobbled up the lowlights in 140 characters or fewer, this is a great lesson in why we should all read beyond the “bad news” spin to get the full context of the story.
The July 26 report looked at mid-year data for craft breweries in the U.S. The BA defines a craft brewer as small, independent and traditional.
Small: Annual production of 6 million barrels of beer or less.
Independent: Less than 25 percent of the craft brewery is owned or controlled (or equivalent economic interest) by an alcoholic beverage industry member that is not itself a craft brewer.
Traditional: A brewer that has a majority of its total beverage alcohol volume in beers whose flavor derives from traditional or innovative brewing ingredients and their fermentation. Flavored malt beverages (FMBs) are not considered beers.
According to the report, the production volume of American craft beer grew eight percent in the first half of 2016. That is indeed a slower pace than the first half of 2015, which saw a 16 percent production volume increase. But as Bart Watson, chief economist at the BA, acknowledges, the industry itself is maturing.
“As craft's base gets larger, as with any industry, it becomes more difficult for it to grow at the same percentage rate. Yet there is still tremendous dynamism reflected in eight percent growth for craft,” Watson explains. It's one of the key points you'll miss if you're only digesting the story at the headline level. Here's a closer look:
1. Maturation not Saturation
“While the craft brewing industry is entering a period of maturation, most markets are not near saturation,” Watson said. That means there are more communities in the U.S. that could support more breweries. Consider this math:
Breweries: 1 for every 69,322. So there are ~5.8 Subways, 3.0 McDonald's, & 2.7 Starbucks for every brewery. https://t.co/eiSbGcnBtZ — Bart Watson (@BrewersStats) July 26, 2016

2. Historic Number of Operating U.S. Breweries
The BA says 4,656 breweries were operating in the U.S. at the time of the report, over 900 more than this time last year. Watson says the rate of breweries opening is still “incredibly strong” compared to the ones closing.
The number of operating U.S. breweries, 4,656, also marks a new historic high. Those small and independent breweries are also responsible for 121,843 full-time and part-time jobs, according to the report; many of those jobs are in manufacturing.
There are another 2,200 breweries in planning, too. You're experiencing history in the making.
Beyond the report, craft brewers are contributing to an unprecedented amount of choices for beer lovers.
“Today's marketplace offers an unparalleled number of styles, flavors and brands of beer – from domestics to imports,” Craig Purser, president and CEO of the National Beer Wholesalers of America (NBWA) said in response to the BA report. NWBA chief economist Lester Jones also predicts the U.S. beer industry will see “continued positive growth” in 2016 as craft brewers attract new people.

So growth in production, a historic number of operating breweries combined with consumer choice equate to positive news for the craft beer industry. Don't worry: Your IPAs (and porters and pale ales and goses) aren't going anywhere anytime soon.

Okay, here's a short theory. The only evidence of Charles hurting Alison was when they tried to sink them in the bathtub, that's it. That could've been an accident or a misunderstanding. They could've been a really troubling kid but I doubt they had any grudges against anyone at that age. Also after watching tonights episode (6:7) proved they didn't hate Alison as a kid, they actually aren't mental when they were at their birthday party. I think going to Radley and being separated from their family are the things that made them mental. They wanted attention and love from their family.
Now because of all of this why is they trying to hurt Alison? Maybe because they actually got the most attention. They were jealous. They were jealous of all the love their parents gave them and not them so they tried to kill her, but when they did they ran away. They never believed they were dead so they stole the game from Mona and started blackmailing the girls hoping that it would catch Alison's attention and she'd come back to help them.
Now, we know that Charles is A and Charles is a male, but who were those two dresses for in the Christmas episode? I think this whole time Charles wasn't the only Dilaurentis sibling that was trapped in Radley and separated from their family, Bethany was too, in fact Bethany was also a Dilaurentis and they were jealous of Alison too so they helped Charles and became red coat. It's either that or Bethany was Alison'ss twin and was killed by Charles to make people think that Alison's body was found and Alison's dead.
ALSO ANOTHER QUICK LITTLE THEORY IF THE ABOVE ABOUT BETHANY BEING A DILAURENTIS ISN'T TRUE-
If Bethany isn't a Dilaurentis they are defiantly a Harvey. I re watched the episode in season 5 when Mona and Spencer sneaked into the Radley file room and listened to Bethany's therapy session and they sounded EXACTLY like Sara. And by season 5 I think they knew who they were gonna cast as Sara so this must mean something. If none of this makes sense then my imagination has officially gone wild..
If the Minecraft movie is even half as popular as the video game, then Mojang will have a true, ahem, blockbuster on its hands. As anticipation builds for Minecraft's silver screen debut, we've decided to dig around for some more information.
Mojang
From potential release dates and budgets, to storylines, directors and producers, here's everything we know about the Minecraft movie so far.
What's the Minecraft movie all about?
Plot details are thin on the ground, but Mojang COO Vu Bui told The Guardian that it will tell one of the countless possible stories from Minecraft's build-it-yourself game world. "When coming up with a story, we want to make sure it is just a story within Minecraft, as opposed to the story within Minecraft," they said. Mojang
Elaborating on their comments, Bui said that the company doesn't want to discourage players by coming up with an official story of the Minecraft universe. Bui said: "We don't want any story that we make, whether it's a movie or a book, to create some sort of 'this is the official Minecraft, this is how you play the game' thing. That would discourage all the players who don't play in that way."
An early report in Deadline suggested that the story would be told in live-action form and wouldn't be animated, although this remains unconfirmed by Mojang. Microsoft Games
Who's making the movie?
Developer Mojang has entrusted Warner Bros to handle the Minecraft move adaptation, with The LEGO Movie's Roy Lee working alongside Jill Messick as producer.
Night at the Museum director Shawn Levy was originally attached to direct, but would later drop out due to creative differences. Writers Kieran Mulroney and Michele Mulroney left the project at the same time.
A report in Variety said that Levy's ideas "didn't mesh with what the video game developers [Mojang] were looking for".
McElhenney tweeted their delight at the announcement, telling Mojang that they wanted to make "something strange and wonderful".
It looks like McElhenney will have a decent amount of cash at their disposal to make the film. Vu Bui has described it as a "large-budget" movie project, although the exact amount is yet to be disclosed. Wait - what is Minecraft, and why is it a big deal?
Taking place in procedurally-generated open worlds made up of millions of cubed blocks, Minecraft tasks players with building, exploring and surviving within multiple game modes.
The game made its debut in back in 2009, but wouldn't debut in full until November 2011. It was hugely popular even before its full release, earning its creator $350k a day and Mojang $33 million. Mojang
The best Minecraft recreations from games, TV and film
Since its debut, it has sold over 70 million copies and has well over 100 million registered users. In 2014, it was the most popular search term on YouTube.
It's such a hot commodity, in fact, that the Minecraft brand and Mojang studio was sold to Microsoft for a whopping $2.5bn in 2014.
The game has so far appeared on pretty much every modern gaming platform - from PC, to Mac, through to PS3, PS4, PS Vita, Xbox One, Xbox 360, iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Amazon Fire TV.
Texture packs themed around The Simpsons, Doctor Who, Star Wars, Guardians of the Galaxy and even Beano have been added to Minecraft since it launched.
It has also spawned countless merchandise, including books, toys, clothing and LEGO. Telltale, meanwhile, is working on Minecraft Story Mode, a plot-driven adventure game set in the Minecraft world. Is there a release date for Minecraft movie?

BEIJING (Reuters) - As the United States and China wrapped up talks this week touting bilateral cooperation on strategic and economic issues, many in the U.S. business community say the annual dialogue is delivering diminishing returns in resolving commercial disputes.

Foreign business in China is growing increasingly pessimistic, in part due to the country's slowing economy, but also because of growing fears of protectionism and rules that companies think could make it harder to operate there.
Concerns include draft regulations for China's insurance and banking industries and a pending cyber-security law that business groups say could limit sales for foreign companies in favor of domestic competitors.
Beijing's Made in China 2025 plan also calls for a progressive increase in domestic components in sectors such as advanced information technology and robotics, and President Xi Jinping has pledged to increase government support for technology companies, raising concerns that foreign providers will be at a disadvantage.
Those plans and proposals sit uneasily with China's “commitments to not impose nationality-based conditions on the sale, purchase or use (of info-technology)”, a pledge repeated during the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED), which on Tuesday wrapped up its eighth and final round under President Barack Obama.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hong Lei said on Wednesday that China would “earnestly put into effect” the much important consensus reached during the talks, but many in the U.S. business community feel the talks provide a forum to repeat previously made promises rather than push progress on market-opening reforms.
“Increasingly, there's been a sense that commitments have been made, and not necessarily adhered to. There's a sense that a growing set of bilateral challenges is outpacing the ability of the dialogue to effectively manage those areas of difference,” said Jeremie Waterman, executive director for Greater China at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Just hours after the S&ED finished in Beijing, the U.S. House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday heard testimony on concerns over China's enforcement of competition law, which include draft regulations that could force firms to license technology to competitors or face sanctions.
But the list of outcomes from this week's talks made no mention of antitrust policy.
China's promise to table next week an updated list of sectors off-limits to U.S. investors for ongoing talks on a bilateral investment treaty was seen as a highlight of the dialogue, though people in the U.S. business community privately say they are not optimistic it will be enough to make real progress on the treaty before Obama leaves office.
RELATIONSHIP BENEFITS
James McGregor, Greater China chairperson for communications consultancy APCO Worldwide, who attended a Tuesday event for executives with senior U.S. and Chinese officials, said executives were blunt in stressing how negative things were becoming for foreign companies in China.
“I think they (officials) all walked out of the room feeling like they'd learned something today and that things are changing and not heading in a good direction now,” McGregor said.
The official rhetoric in China has focused less on the concrete achievements of the dialogue and more on the relationship benefits.
The official Xinhua news agency said the talks had infused relations with a “shot of confidence”.
“Only by constantly augmenting the areas of cooperation and pursuing consensus can China-U.S. ties move in a positive direction,” it said in a commentary late on Tuesday.
That can help counter some of the anti-China sentiment whipped up during the American presidential race, some Chinese officials have said.
“During the ongoing raging fire of the U.S. election, candidates from both parties frequently make a fuss about trade problems with China. But China has not made an excessive response because we can more truly and accurately understand the true nature of problems and avoid misjudgments through the dialogue mechanism,” Vice Premier Wang Yang said in a speech on Monday.
U.S. businesses also acknowledge that the S&ED has provided a high-profile forum to air their concerns and are advocating reforming it, not writing it off.
“In the next administration, the mechanisms for dialogue can be tweaked to make further improvements and become more effective, but high-level engagement is now mandatory in the U.S.-China relationship,” the U.S.-China Business Council said in a statement.

With mixed martial arts constantly evolving and the quality of striking coming along at a speed of knots—well, in some divisions—it is well worth the time of every MMA fan to acquaint themselves with the best in the business of bruising. In our previous two installments we discussed old timey boxers and modern Muay Thai legends and plenty in between. Today we'll look at three more of the best strikers to ever lace up gloves (or not, in one instance).
Badr Hari
What to watch for: Counter right straight, Right straight to the body, Cross hand traps, Crossface punches.
Badr Hari might be the most technically superb heavyweight kickboxer I have ever seen. Though their best days are considered to be behind them at just thirty years old, Hari's list of accomplishments in their career is still imposing. Name a top flight heavyweight kickboxer from 2005 onwards and he's probably beaten them. In fact, there's a great chance they starched them outright. That list even includes the most accomplished heavyweight kickboxer of them all, Semmy Schilt.
Hari had all kinds of flaws. They couldn't take a punch very well, they were a wild man whose technique went to pot when they smelled blood, and their quick temper cost them many fans and threatened to see the K-1 Heavyweight Champion imprisoned. But when they had kept their cool and their form held up, they were dangerous from all angles.
Hari began their career known as a gangly kicker, but once they learned that they could knock out almost anyone in the world with their right hand, their boxing came to the fore. Few have had success with the jab in kickboxing as Hari did, but it was their right straight which really put fighters to the floor. They could time it to perfection, here they are executing what the great boxer, Barney Ross considered to be the most powerful counter punch of all—the right straight inside the left hook.
But Hari's best weapon was the right straight to the body. Like the jab to the body, but considerably more powerful, this weapon works excellently against opponents who are fighting with their hands high—as all of Hari's did because of the power in their gloves and the dexterity in their high kicks. You will see it make a rare appearance on your average fight card, but Hari went to it with such frequency and effect. They floored plenty of men with the punch on its own, but often it served mainly to drop the opponent's elbows and allow Hari's headache makers through upstairs.
Another interesting trick of Hari's was the outside cross hand trap. Almost exclusively useful against a shelled up opponent, this is where the left hand is reach all the way across the to the opponent's left hand, and drags it down to make a path for the right hand.
As I mentioned earlier, Hari is on the arse end of their troubled and rocky career at this point, but they are still more worthy of study than any heavyweight kickboxer active today.
Tway Ma Shaung
What to watch for: All nine limbs, all the time. Textbook head butts.
In our first installment we looked at the Muay Thai genius of Saenchai. Methodical and minimalistic even in their flamboyance, Saenchai starts with the push kick and builds upwards, rarely striking in extensive combinations and often winning confident, lop-sided decisions. Tway Ma Shaung may be the opposite side to that coin.
A Burmese Lethwei competitor, Tway Ma Shaung is considered one of the best in their under-advertised art and regularly takes on and outclasses larger opponents as Saenchai does. But that's pretty much where the similarities end. Shaung is a wild man in the ring. They have technical skills, certainly, but they fight more in the Matt Brown mould which we love so much—crowding opponents and attempting to hit them with everything they possibly can.
Lethwei is considered the art of nine limbs—allowing all the traditional Muay Thai weapons, plus head butts—and Shaung seems to be the embodiment of this. They have their favourites, but they really looks like a whirlwind of aggression who will attempt anything and everything.
As always with Lewei fighters, it's interesting to note how the lack of gloves affects their punching form and shot selection, and how Shaung uses their head to cause damage. Notice that in clinches, as they fight for inside control, Shaung will make the opponent a little more malleable by slamming the top side of their head into their brow or temple.
And should they cover up, they look to get their head lower and drive the hard part of their skull into the soft, squishy face of the opponent. Classic Evander Holyfield strategy, but totally legal in Lethwei. Head butting is an art form even when legal because if you miss place one of these you're driving your own face onto an elbow:
They might not have the science and craft of Saenchai or Giorgio Petrosyan, but he's a study in chaos done right, and he's well worth your time.
Jose Napoles
What to watch for: The bounce, the lead uppercut, long rhythm.
My favorite thing about combat sports is that, as much as everyone preaches that there is a 'right' way to fight, there is no single method to win a fight. I've touched on this issue plenty before, most notably in comparing the footwork of Joe Louis and Muhammad Ali. Louis shuffled and stayed in position to fire, Ali danced and drew opponents onto their leads. Completely different styles, but both produced tremendous results. Neither man succeeded in spite of their footwork, but rather because of it.
Everything has its pros and cons. Bouncing footwork has the enormous downside of removing a degree of control from the fighter. A bounce is when both feet leave the floor almost together. To see this go horribly wrong, check out Martin Kampmann getting caught by Johny Hendricks. Kampmann begins bouncing back and forth in rhythm, and when the predictable Hendricks lunge comes, Kampmann cannot react fast enough. They have committed their weight into the air and into a forward bounce, no time to burst backwards until he's finished the motion.
A tiny detail, but a beautiful illustration of how dangerous it can be to bounce for the sake of bouncing. But when you see bouncing done right, it's downright beautiful. Cuban boxing great, Jose Napoles was so damn smooth with their bouncing in and out, they nicknamed them 'butter'. But in Spanish its a lot sexier... and Mantequilla had some of the most outright gorgeous boxing you'll ever see.
Not only does Napoles' bounce get them in faster, it also takes them out of range and has them primed to bounce back in on rhythm with a lead uppercut. That lead uppercut is just another reason to love Napoles—too few fighters can use it effectively and Napoles, along with Alexis Arguello and Roy Jones Jr. is one of the absolute best I've seen with it.
If you've never understood the fuss about Cuban boxers, Napoles is a good place to start. A study in rhythm and cadence at the highest levels of the game.

Hundreds of pairs of sunglasses and swim goggles wash up at Burleigh Heads
Updated
Hundreds of lost sunglasses and swim goggles have washed up on a Gold Coast beach after unusual surf conditions.
Burleigh Heads residents awoke on Friday morning to find the unusual haul shining in the morning light amongst seaweed along the iconic beach.
Local Judy Cumming was on their daily walk when they stumbled across the find.
"[I saw] probably about 150 pairs of sunglasses, probably about 100 pairs of goggles," they told ABC Gold Coast.
"I'm not exaggerating and people have been walking past and taking a pair."
Ms Cumming and their friends regularly collect garbage they find washed up on the beach and on Friday, the group collected their unusual haul on a table and offered them to passers-by.
They usually find the odd item at low tide but Ms Cumming thinks the weather conditions combined to present them with the unusual phenomenon.
"I think the way the waves are running at the moment and the northerly wind conditions are making all the seaweed come into the beach," they said.
"All this stuff is caught up in the seaweed [and] that's why we have so many sunglasses and goggles on the beach."
'Amazing' phenomenon says expert
Experts said the strange sight could have been caused by a number of surf and weather conditions.
Darrell Strauss from the Griffith University Centre for Coastal Management admitted it was a little odd.
"It's amazing actually," Dr Strauss said.
"I guess though, if you consider how many people go for a swim down at Burleigh over summer often with their sunnies and their goggles on..."
They said the large haul of eyewear could just be this summer's collection of lost glasses from Burleigh Heads beach as the lightweight plastic items gather in the depths with the seaweed.
"They just drift out to that deeper water where not much is really happening," Dr Strauss said.
"Over time, they're gathering out there and just washing backwards and forwards."
They said the causes could be similar to recent mass of jellyfish washing up in Deception Bay.
"The wind ... kind of collects that stuff in the corner at Burleigh," they said.
"The other process is upwelling [where] the surface water is moving offshore and it gets replaced by cold water from underneath."

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why did Trump give information to the Russians? The reporter who broke the story explains.
US President Donald Trump has defended their "absolute right" to discuss sensitive material on terrorism and airline safety at a meeting with Russia's foreign minister.
US media reports said they had shared material that was passed on by a partner that had not given permission.
The White House refused to comment on reports that Israel was the source.
Though not illegal, Mr Trump's alleged gaffe is seen as a breach of trust by many in the intelligence community.
Mr Trump met Sergei Lavrov last week in the Oval Office, out of view of the US media.
Leading Republicans and Democrats have voiced concerns over what was said, with top Senate Democrat leader Chuck Schumer calling for the transcripts to be released by the White House.
The US Senate Intelligence Committee has also asked for copies of any notes taken in the meeting. CIA Director Mike Pompeo is due to brief the committee later.
Mr Trump's alleged disclosures are not illegal, as the US president has the authority to declassify information.
What was the president's defence?
Mr Trump tweeted: "As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety.
"Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against [IS] & terrorism."
It is not clear if Mr Trump was acknowledging having shared intelligence secrets with the Russian officials, thus contradicting White House statements, or whether they were simply trying to explain what had been discussed.
The BBC's Anthony Zurcher in Washington says this was a carefully constructed defence of the meeting, in which President Trump frames any revelation of intelligence information as a calculated move to advance US national security priorities.
After all, the controversy that swirled around the White House on Monday night was never legal, it was political, and this defence may be enough for Republicans to rally around, they add.
What happened in the Oval Office?
A report in the Washington Post on Monday said Mr Trump had confided top secret information relating to an IS plot thought to centre on the use of laptop computers on aircraft.
In a conversation with the Russian foreign minister and Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in the Oval Office on 10 May, the president revealed details that could lead to the exposure of a source of information, officials told the paper.

The intelligence disclosed came from a US ally and was considered too sensitive to share with other US allies, it added.
Others at the meeting realised the mistake and scrambled to "contain the damage" by informing the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA), says the Post.
The meeting came a day after Mr Trump fired their FBI chief, James Comey, sparking criticism that they had done so because the FBI was investigating their election campaign's alleged Russian ties.
On Tuesday, US media reported the divulged material had been provided to the US by Israel, where Mr Trump is due to visit next week.
How has the White House responded?
Pressed by reporters on Tuesday, National Security Adviser HR McMaster declined to say whether or not Mr Trump had shared classified information with the Russians.
They denied the US president had caused a "lapse in national security".
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption McMaster: 'Trump not even briefed on intel source or method'
"What the president discussed with the foreign minister was wholly appropriate to that conversation and is consistent with the routine sharing of information between the president and any leaders with whom he's engaged."
They also said President Trump had not been aware of the source of information that was discussed with the Russian officials.
Golden rule: Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent
Despite the denials issued by the White House that any actual intelligence sources were revealed to the Russians, whatever was said in that Oval Office meeting was enough to alarm certain officials and, reportedly, to alert the CIA and NSA.
They in turn will have needed to warn the country that supplied the intelligence. There is a golden rule in the world of espionage that when one government supplies intelligence to another it must not be passed on to a third party without permission of the original supplier. The reason is simple: it could put the lives of their human informants at risk.
In this case it appears to relate to the discovery of plans by jihadists in Syria to devise a way of smuggling viable explosive devices on board a plane inside a laptop computer. Given the well-publicised ban on laptops in cabins on certain Middle Eastern routes, whoever revealed that information is unlikely to be still in place.
What has the reaction been?
"This is dangerous and reckless" - Dick Durbin, Senate's second-highest ranked Democrat
"Mr President, this isn't about your 'rights', but your responsibilities. You could jeopardise our sources, relationships and security" - Adam Schiff, top Democrat on House Intelligence Committee
"A troubling signal to America's allies and partners around the world and may impair their willingness to share intelligence with us in the future" - Republican Senator John McCain
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chuck Schumer: "President Trump may have exposed our nation to greater risk"
"We have no way to know what was said, but protecting our nation's secrets is paramount" - spokesperson for Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan
Congress could do with "a little less drama from the White House" - Mitch McConnell, Senate majority leader
"We generally do not want to have anything to do with this nonsense" - Dmitry Peskov, Kremlin spokesperson
"If true, this is not going to instil confidence in allies already wary of sharing the most sensitive information" - senior Nato diplomat quoted by Reuters

The Original Nerd Room
This month marks the 10 year anniversary since James made the Castlevania II: Simon's Quest video. The very first Angry Video Game Nerd episode. (At the time called Bad NES Games) Here James looks at their old bedroom where the first episode was made.
-posted by Mike
UPDATE: The video states that the first two AVGN episodes were made in May 2004. Not be overly technical, but I found the script for Episode 2: Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, a Word document “date modified” is June 15, 2004. We'll never know the exact dates both videos were completed, but Episode 1: Castlevania 2 was late May. Episode 2: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was June, contrary to what's said in the video. The first two episodes were made so close together, it can be confusing.
These two episodes were made following my graduation, when boredom began to sink in. This was during a temporary stay at my parents' old house. In late summer 2004, I moved into an apartment, the same place where eventually in 2006, Episode 3: Karate Kid and further episodes were made.

Mickey Rourke has defended their pal Johnny Depp amid the serious allegations of domestic abuse made against them by their ex Amber Heard.
The actor spoke to TMZ on Saturday about their longtime friend and insisted that while they don't “know anything” about Amber, they thought that 53-year-old Depp was always a “gentleman”.
“He doesn't seem like a very violent man to me, Rourke said. “He's always been like really low-key and gentleman[ly]. Not a violent guy.”

In their legal documents, Amber claimed Johnny's security team did nothing as they shouted for help and threatened to call 911 during an alleged violent bust-up.
The Rum Diary actor, who filed for divorce from the 53-year-old actor this month , claims they picked up a magnum bottle of champagne during the row on May 21 and was swinging it "like a baseball bat".
They claimed when Johnny arrived at their family home they were having a peaceful conversation in the living room talking about their mother's recent before things allegedly turned physical. They deny being the accusations of domestic violence.

"He then demanded we call our friend iO Tilet Wright (iO) to prove their paranoid and irrational accusations about some delusional idea they were having," Amber said in court papers.
"As my call to iO went through on speakerphone, Johnny ripped the cellphone from my hand and began screaming profanities and insults at iO. I heard iO yell at me to get out of the house.
"Johnny then grabbed the cellphone, wound up their arm like a baseball pitcher and threw the cell phone at me striking my cheeky and eye with great force.
"I immediately covered my face and was crying because of the pain.

"Johnny charged at me, insisting on seeing my face. They taunted me, challenged whether or not the cellphone actually hit me.
"He then forcibly pulled back my hair as I attempted to stand up from the sofa. I then yelled out 'Call 911', hoping it would be heard by iO who was still on the phone."
The chaos reportedly attracted members of their actor's security team, but they claim they ignored their shouts for help.
It was only when they allegedly threatened to call the police "if Johnny hits me one more time", that one member said: "Boss, please."

Amber went on: "But Johnny continued screaming and breaking things, finally leaving the condominium. As Johnny went down the hallway, they smashed another bottle and wine then went into the adjoining condominium I used as my office, painting studio and closet.
"I could hear them destroying items of personal property as they continued screaming."
The police were called but Johnny had already left the property and Amber has declined to press charges.

Amber has been granted a temporary restraining order from the actor, while they have released a statement denying claims their estranged wife was a victim of domestic abuse.
A representative for Depp said: "Given the brevity of this marriage and the most recent and tragic loss of their mother, Johnny will not respond to any of the salacious false stories, gossip, misinformation and lies about their personal life.
"Hopefully the dissolution of this short marriage will be resolved quickly."
Ever since Rafael Nadal arrived in Anantapur three years ago to inaugurate their foundations first project on 17th October, 2010; a tennis school for the underprivileged, hundreds of children arrive twice a day, daily, to learn the nuances of the sport, free of cost (IE Photos Kashif Masood)
Shards of daylight stream through the sparse flora of Anantapuram, the largest of 23 districts in Andhra Pradesh, well past supper time. But the villagers of Raptadu, an unremarkable hamlet that skirts the district's principal town of Anantapur, prepare for darkness earlier. Far earlier.
By about late afternoon, beedi shop vendors and tea stall owners down their shutters, turning away the thirsty. At about the same time, perfumed lovers slink away behind the deserted government school yard, clasping hands and giggling. Their fidgeting never fails to draw a smile from the heavily tanned Nuria Sanchez Garcia.
Perched atop their blue bicycle, Nuria, a 25-year old from Salamanca, Spain, pedals down hard on the red mud path. They were once a professional tennis player, at one point even ranked 450th in the world. At 21, though, they vowed to never touch a tennis racquet again. But today, like every other day of their stay in India, they are about to break that promise.
"Ela vunnaru," Nuria says in Telugu, greeting familiar faces on the road with a wave from their bike. Soon though, they will be received in a familiar language. "Como estas," the local kids will ask in Spanish, flocking around them as they begin their routine stretches. But now is not that time. There is still some way to pedal before they reach the clay courts. Time enough to think of their past life, one left behind like the trail of their cycle on the dusty road.
They think of how they always wanted to be a tennis star, picking up their first racquet at the age of four. They think of how they enrolled at the academy in Barcelona when they were seven, and how they met their batch-mates turned best friends, Carla Suarez Navarro and Nicolas Almagro, now ranked 14th and 15th in the world.
They think of how they often travelled around the junior circuits in Spain with that quiet and good-natured boy from Mallorca called Rafael Nadal. They think of those living-out-of-a-suitcase days and the struggles of being a low-ranked globe-trotter. A globe-trotter who couldn't ever point out India on a map. India? "Ninguna parte"  middle of nowhere.
Then they think of how they shelved their tennis ambitions and started studying human rights law. And how they wanted to do some volunteering work for the underprivileged around the world. And how Nadal got to hear of their plans five months ago. Then they opened their atlas and pointed 'nowhere' out to Nuria.
***
"Rafa want me to come, no? So I come here," Nuria says. "Just other day, after winning US Open, they email and ask me how I am doing in Anantapur. So I reply and say, 'I want to be nowhere, always'."
Literally in the middle of this "nowhere" is the first, biggest and dearest project of the Rafa Nadal Foundacion  the RDT-Rafa Nadal Educational & Sports School. In their wish to "provide an opportunity for children and adolescents with disabilities and from underprivileged surroundings (in the words of the foundation's motto)", Nadal has pumped in millions of dollars to build five state-of-the-art and flood-lit clay courts, encased within the low platform of a school corridor, in Anantapur. Then three years ago, they personally arrived to inaugurate it.
The foundation aims to use "sport as a tool for personal and social reintegration", and Nadal's efforts have ensured that hundreds of children from the neighbouring villages have been arriving twice a day, daily, for the past three years to play a sport they hadn't heard of, to study a language (English) that only "abroad folk" speak and to learn to use a computer, a tool that has brought the universe to Anantapur.
So why Anantapur, you ask? Actually, no one in Spain ever does. The answer lies in a name Vicente Ferrer.
Incarcerated at the now infamous Argelès-sur-Mer concentration camp for their role as an army officer during the Spanish Civil War, Barcelona born Ferrer spent their time pouring over the Bible in 1939. When released a year later, they studied law for four years, dumped it and aimed to become a Jesuit  a process that takes 11 years. A missionary by 1951, Ferrer decided to spread the word of god in India. But on arrival in Manmad, Maharashtra, they disowned the Church and decided to help the poor at a physical, rather than spiritual, level.
The result? Sixty-three years later, when Ferrer died at the age of 89 in Anantapur, their funeral was attended by 2 lakh followers, and mourned by at least 2 million the number of lives they immediately improved in the drought-stricken land (the Anantapur region is the second driest part of India, after the Jaisalmer desert in Rajasthan).
The most recognisable face of humanitarianism in Spain, Ferrer was awarded their top peace prize  the Prince of Asturias Concord  in 1998. A year after they died in 2009, they were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize as well.
***
But why the anonymity in India, save a few pockets? "Because we have always hated publicity. And my father despised it more than most," says Moncho Ferrer, who heads the Rural Development Trust (now known as the Ferrer Foundation) that their father Vicente founded in Anantapur, back in 1970. "Publicity nearly killed them in the first place."
They explain. "Back in Manmad, well before they ever stepped foot in Anantapur, my father started this system called the 'linked brotherhood'. It was a simple idea  they helped one man dig a well. Then the two of them helped a third. Then the three of them found a fourth. Soon there were close to a 100,000." By 1968, Moncho reckons (often in their first language, Telugu), Manmad, once desolate, was a flourishing land. This is when Life magazine sent down its reporters from the US to do a story on this Marathi-speaking Spaniard. "After that, all hell broke loose," says Moncho.
The piece did not go down well with credit-hungry politicians. Moncho says these netas and landowners joined hands to throw Ferrer out of the country. This was opposed by 30,000 people, who walked 240 km in protest.
"The then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, had to step in to defuse the tension. They asked my father to return to Spain and come back within a month. Only, it couldn't be in Maharashtra."
So Ferrer chose Anantapur, a move that was apreciated by the Andhra Pradesh government with welcoming arms. "But they warned them against the district they had chosen," says Moncho. "'Nothing is possible in a place that is dirt poor and receives 11 days of rainfall annually,' they told him. And my father replied, 'Great. That's exactly where I want to be'. They spent the rest of their life there, from 1969 onwards."
In the following 40 years, estimates Moncho, Vicente built 1,800 rural schools, six general hospitals and several women's rights centres, family-planning and AIDS clinics. They also encouraged digging of wells and formulation of irrigation schemes. All this was made possible by donations, now amounting to about $15 million a year from Spaniards alone.
***
One of those is Manuel Vazquez, a 33-year-old bank employee from La Coruna, who has been sponsoring the education of two children, Varralaxmi, 8, and Chandrakala, 10, for two years. "It costs about $100 per child per month. So I've spent roughly $5,000 on these kids so far," says Vazquez thorugh a translator.  They are in Anantapur to visit the children for the first time. There was no need for a translator then. "When I saw them for the first time in their village, I started crying. And when I left, they started crying."
They have another interesting story to tell about their visit. "I had asked some of my friends what to take for the kids. Something I could give to the entire village. They all said, in unison, 'Sunglasses!' So I carried eight boxes, about 300 glasses, to distribute. There was no space to pack clothes because of the sunglasses, so I carried just one T-shirt, one pair of shorts and two underwears. That was fine by me, for it's not like I was going to make girlfriends here, no?" they say, leaving their translator in splits.
"So I gave everyone I saw in the village one each. And soon the next village heard and they came. So I gave them sunglasses too. Soon I was out and one old lady wanted the spectacles I was wearing. I told her, 'If I give this to you, I will never be able to see my way back'. They understood I think."
But what drew them to Anantapur? "I had my mind set on Cameroon first. But I faced stiff resistance from my colleagues. They said you either give your money to Anantapur or don't give at all. Another friend wanted to sponsor three kids in Bihar. Again, despite it being in India, they were looked down upon. Again, Anantapur or nothing."
In Ferrer and Anantapur, the Spaniards trust. Nadal, hence, really didn't have a choice.
***
It was early on a Sunday morning  October 17, 2010  when Moncho Ferrer stood red-eyed under their umbrella. It was one of the 14 times it rained that year, supposes Moncho. Behind them waited a party of people big enough to fill out an army bunker. Some of them were their school friends from Kodaikanal, others were the who's who of the RDT foundation, including the Sports & Cultural Director, Eeli Francis Xavier.
"At about 3 am it was when Rafa arrived," says Xavier, who is now on a first-name basis with the 13-time Grand Slam winner. Xavier has personally watched a mud-track for kids interested in running grow into the Anantapur Sports Village, which holds three cricket stadiums (one of them even hosts Ranji Trophy matches), a gymnasium, two hockey fields and as many football grounds. And of course, lest we forget, the latest attraction. The school and tennis complexes that Nadal helped build, and which they help run by providing $2 million every year. This was inauguration day.
"At about 5 in the evening the next day, they cut the ribbon to open their academy. Their baby," says Moncho, swelling with pride. "I mean, listen, this is Rafael Nadal, standing in a plot of land in Andhra. I had to pinch myself when they pinched the cheeks of a few wards."
Did they eventually play with them? "There they are, hitting for close to two hours, trying to lose every point they could, making everyone around them go mad," says Moncho, boasting of the local talent. "Hey, I took a point off them too. But they approached the net for a volley." Nadal and volleys, never the best of friends.
One of those kids who Nadal played with during their only visit to the sports academy was Sri Harihara. Having just turned 14, they are one of the darlings at the academy. Today, like many days since their top-spin heavy game (but of course!) blossomed, they have the best court to himself, playing against the best coach in the academy, L Bhaskaracharya. "This boy is going places. Already they are playing competitive tennis," says Bhaskaracharya, or Bacchi in short.
Out there, on a surface fine enough to give Monte Carlo or Hamburg a run for its money, Sri Harihara, with trousers folded to their shins like pirate pants and their longish, unkempt hair, is a real sight. Their forehand follow-through finishes behind their neck. The impersonation is complete when Harihara pumps their fist, flexes their arms and goes: "Vamos!" Or belittles themselves after a terrible shot with a "Culo tondo. Idiota!". Meaning "stupid ass" and "fool" respectively.
The kids, all 124 of them in the complex today, adore him. Only some of these children are in the remaining four courts at the time. The others are in either the adjacent computer science lab or in the classroom that teaches English.
***
"Repeat after me, there are five classes of nouns, proper noun, collective noun, abstract...," trails off Mahu Basha, the English teacher. In singsong, the children repeat "Proper noun, collective noun, abstract...". Basha is thrilled. "In this sentence 'Ashoka is a great king', what is the proper noun?" they ask. Supriya Lakshmi, a 9-year old girl from Puttaparthi, shoots up with the correct answer. Basha throws them a tennis ball, sponsored by Nadal's gear  Babolat. Sundip Reddy gets one too, for telling Surya Krishna, the computer teacher, just what input and output devices are in a computer. "Input  keyboard, mouse, scanner. Output  monitor, printer...."
"Okay boys and girls, time to go for tennis session now. The tennis ones will go to English classes. And those in English classroom will come here," says Krishna, a digital whiz. From 5 pm-8 pm, in batches of three, they rotate. But most of them want to be part of the 7-8 pm tennis session. For it's held under lights. And it's taught by the ever-so-lovely Nuria Sanchez Garcia.
Nuria is now priming a bunch of schoolgirls to play the backhand. All executed with top-quality Babolats  sent by Nadal's official sponsors every year. "Pichekinda Ramana?" they yell in Telugu, asking if Ramana, 13, is "mad". They haven't crossed the net once, not once in an entire session. "Si, lo siento teacher, lo siento," says Ramana in Spanish, furiously apologising for their lack of ability. It's fine, says Nuria with a smile and a nod. Tomorrow morning, at 6, Nuria and Ramana will try again.
The buses, patiently parked outside, wait to take the kids back. Back home from the middle of "nowhere".

A Republican candidate running for Congress in Nevada says former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney was right when they made their controversial "47 percent" remarks.
"Can I say that without getting in trouble like Gov. Romney," Cresent Hardy, a state assemblyman, said in a video posted online by the Nevada State Democratic Party. "The 47 percent is true. It's bigger now."
During the 2012 presidential campaign, a secretly recorded video from a private fundraiser caught Romney declaring that 47 percent of the electorate would "vote for the president no matter what."
"There are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it," they said, according to the video released by Mother Jones. "That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what... These are people who pay no income tax."
Hardy is running against incumbent Rep. Steven Horsford (D-Nev.) to represent District 4, which includes North Las Vegas. The Las Vegas Sun reports that Horsford is a heavy favorite to win re-election.
UPDATE: Hardy released a statement to The Huffington Post through their consultants saying he's not "slick or polished."
"I grew up on a ranch and learned to stand up for what I believe and to speak my mind respectfully even when others may disagree," they said.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has given notice of its intent to database a large number of very personal data points on every American who possesses a mortgage — which may include as many as 227 million Americans. These points include things like financial histories, credit card balances, credit scores, personal demographics, lists of assets and property, family information, and more.
Assembled with the help of the the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, the database's stated purpose is for research and modeling. The agencies have been collecting data for modeling for years, but the addition of many new pieces of personally identifiable information is a reversal of previously stated policy.
The database will include very specific and personal information on the borrowers and co-borrowers. According to the Federal Register Notice on April 16, 2014, the database includes:
Individual's name, address, and phone number;
Individual's Social Security Number;
Individual's gender, race, ethnicity, and religion;
Individual's marital status;
Individual's household composition (number and ages of males, females, children);
Individual's household income;
Individual's credit score;
Individual's education records;
Individual's military status/records;
Individual's employment status/records;
Individual's bank account numbers;
List of individual's “financial events in the last few years”;
List of individual's “life events in the last few years”;
List of individual's other assets/wealth;
Individual's current mortgage balance;
Individual's current monthly mortgage payment;
Individual's payment delinquency records;
Individual's bankruptcy records;
Individual's credit card numbers;
Individual's credit card balances;
Individual's credit card charge limit and the highest balance charged;
Individual's minimum payments due on all loans;
Attributes of the property (square footage, number of rooms, lot size…);
Sale price and down payment of the property;
Mortgage information (dates, interest rate, amount, loan servicer…);
As one could imagine, a trove of information like this would be an identity thief's paradise. As Rep. Randy Neugebauer said to the Washington Examiner, “If someone were to breach that system, they could very easily steal somebody's identity.”
Like so many parts of the federal government, the National Mortgage Database was never authorized by Congress and was certainly not authorized by the constitution.
According to the notice, the system went online May 27, 2014.

I'm so glad chili season is upon us!
The other day, when Tim picked me up at the bus station after work, at around 11pm, I made them drive me to our local (thankfully 24h) diner because I just HAD to eat a bowl of chili!
The diner chili was okay, but it was nothing compared to homemade chili. So my cravings were pretty much still alive inside my body, whispering in my ears: chiliiii, chiliiiii! Creepy, I know!
I couldn't bear it any longer, so the next day I went to the store and got everything I needed for one of my favorite chili recipes: Sweet Potato Chili. A vegetarian, yet very tasty chili to please my sweet potato lover husband!
I don't know if my sudden chili craving had anything to do with the fact that I got a bad cold. Probably… I always crave comfort food when I'm sick!
I am in fact battling this so-called cold for the past week or so. Tim finally got it too (I was hoping their manly strong genes would protect him, even though we share a bed) and now I'm taking care of a very cranky sick boy!
Why is it that we, women, can work 2 double shifts in a row even though we are sick, but the second our husbands get sick they act as if it's their last night on earth?
Thank goodness for comfort food! And thank goodness for delicious Sweet Potato Chili to nourish us back to health!
I gotta say, Tim and I aren't really into extremely spicy food.
This chili definitely has some heat and any more than that would be too much for us!
But that being said, I'm kinda glad for its spiciness! Nothing like something spicy to clear you up when you are congested!
Too much information? Sorry! ?
For this chili, I used both the RO*TEL chunky diced tomatoes with green chilies and the Hunt's crushed tomatoes that I purchased at my local Walmart. RO*TEL has a mild variety of that same product, so if you're not into spicy food, just get that instead.
I like using canned tomatoes because they make my life so much easier! I'm already so stressed with everything else, at least dinner making needs to be semi- therapeutic, right?
I also chose to use black eyed peas because I'm kinda obsessed with them. They are my mom's favorite, but I avoided them during my whole childhood. When I finally tried them, I was hooked! Now, I always have a couple of cans in my pantry to use in salads, stews and chili. I honestly think they paired perfectly with the sweet potatoes!
If you know me, you are probably really surprised that I didn't add any protein to this chili.
I got so inspired by all the pretty bright colors in the chili, with all the veggies, that I really didn't think to add any meat. However, if you still think you need your protein fix, I think ground turkey would go great with all these flavors!
Meat or no meat, this chili is amazing, healthy and is perfect for those cold nights when all you are craving is a bowl of comfort food.
Don't forget to add a lot of toppings. My favorites are sour cream and a lot of shredded cheddar cheese! ?
Security firms and anti-malware providers sure do have their work cut out for them, a fact that seems to get emphasized every day. As attackers become more creative, researchers have to dig deep in order to understand how malware manages to hide itself so well. It used to be that static scanners would be suitable enough, but that's hardly the case nowadays. Attackers are becoming even more creative, creating almost ninja-like malware.
Take Rombertik, for example. This is a piece of malware that was deeply analyzed by Cisco's Talos Security Intelligence and Research Group that at the high level hooks into a user's Web browser to read sensitive information that is then passed along to a remote attack server. Cisco notes that this is not too dissimilar from the Dyre malware we talked about last month. Unlike Dyre, Rombertik doesn't target banking information specifically, but instead fetches whatever it deems useful.
Rombertik is spread through spam and phishing campaigns, and ultimately persuades its receivers to download, extract, and then open the attachments. It might be hard to believe, and not to mention unfortunate, but yes, people still fall for this.
In Rombertik's case, it seems most attachments were PDFs, or at least looked like PDFs. In reality, they were renamed .SCR screensaver files -- an attack point that has been present for ages. With simple detection mechanisms, Rombertik can go unnoticed as it manages to avoid both static and dynamic analysis.
Once executed, Rombertik will run through a couple of checks to make sure it's not running in a sandbox, and if not, it will fully install itself on the victim's PC. It then copies itself and overwrites the copy with a copy that bundles the malware's core functionality.
Here's where things get interesting: if the final check fails, which is to see if it's being analyzed in memory, Rombertik will purge the hard disk's MBR and reboot, so that the PC becomes unbootable. If the MBR is somehow unaffected by its attempts, Rombertik will instead render the user's home folder useless by encrypting each file with a random key, and then reboot. Neither of these routes are ideal, but the former could be fixed - the latter cannot.
If you want to dig deep into how Rombertik works, you'll want to check out the article below, as it's very in-depth, and even a bit enlightening. For the enterprise and home alike, this is yet another example of why staff need to be well-aware of the dangers of opening unsolicited attachments.

So, have you decided who you are voting for yet? Iain Gray or Alex Salmond?
You do realise that they are your only options? Kenny Farquharson said so, and the Scotland on Sunday Deputy Editor has “been a Scottish political journalist for 20 years” so no quibbling with the experts y'hear, although Kenny is voting for Margo MacDonald which seems to contradict these points;
“anyone who backs their favourite party with their constituency vote rather than their regional vote is effectively depriving themselves of a say on who becomes First Minister.”
“I've seen the leaflet that's being sent out to every home in Scotland in advance of 5 May, and it does nothing to spell out that it's the all-important regional vote that will ultimately determine who makes it into Bute House.”
Kenny, and the assembled throng at the Scotsman leader debates, were apparently told by Alex Salmond that the second vote was for choosing who leads the Scottish Government. How this becomes SNP vs Labour rather than just selecting the party you like best of all the parties is beyond me. Those that argue that realistically it will only be the SNP and Labour who form the next Government and votes should be directed their way would, presumably, be voting SNP or Labour anyway.
Taking the unlikely duo of Kenny and Alex's logic to the extreme, the next Scottish Parliament will consist of solely Nats and Labour MSPs. As strong a contribution as both parties have made to devolved Scotland over the past 12 years, I find that a horrifying prospect and a realisation of the nightmare Americanization of Britain. Yes, get used to those z's, they be coming down those Appalachians soon boy, you do realize that…?
Anyway, surely the second vote is in fact our primary vote. We have a ballot slip that will include numerous independents and parties and, whatever our view of Scotland, there will be somewhere to place our X on there to make our voice heard whether you're a lentil-munching Greenie or a borders-closing UKIP. The limited field of four or five candidates in the constituency vote restricts our opportunity to reflect our political beliefs on the ballot slip. This is all happily irrespective of who may or may not be First Minister.
Indeed, an oddity that Kenny seems to overlook in their study of the Holyrood voting system is that, while voters should apparently concern themselves with who will be at Bute House, they should not be concerned with who will provide the votes to allow SNP/Labour policies to pass and what concessions may be extracted. Working on the safe assumption that neither the SNP nor Labour will win a majority, the regional vote is as important for deciding who ends up holding the balance of power over the next four years as it is for deciding who gets to be First Minister.
Were past Holyrood successes borne out of who was in Bute House or the makeup of Holyrood at large? Fees were abolished thanks to SNP, Greens and Lib Dems, police numbers remain higher thanks to the Conservatives and SNP and we have free care for the eldery thanks to Labour and the Lib Dems. Granted, sometimes the First Minister drives on a policy that is a personal objective, Jack McConnell and the smoking ban for example, but let's not kid ourselves that the Scottish Parliament is a one-man band just because it makes for a decent headline in the Sundays.
Only the voters of East Lothian and Gordon get to vote for Iain Gray and Alex Salmond, the rest of us should stick to the names on our constituency and regional ballot, if we truly believe in a parliamentary democracy as opposed to a presidential autocracy that is.
If the big two of the SNP and Labour are going to be joined by journalists in the myopic mantra of ‘Salmond vs Gray' at the expense of the other parties that make Holyrood a richer place, then the further narrowing of the already strangled debate in this nation will continue and we may well be done for.
At the start of Kenny's article the following is stated:
“the election result is just an accidental accumulation of a dozen different misunderstandings on the part of a confused electorate.”
I celebrate that fact rather than lament it. Is a varied interpretation of how to vote and who to vote for, tactically, historically, impulsively or otherwise not a celebration of democracy itself?

Is It Possible We See New South Wales Select Sonny Bill Williams In The 2014 State Of Origin Series?
Imagine the headlines… New South Wales selects Sonny Bill Williams in game one of the 2014 State Of Origin series. I think the entire country would go into a meltdown.
International eligibility rules state that after a World Cup, the most important international tournament we have, every single player is allowed to switch nations. I know that sounds completely ridiculous. It makes no sense that you would spend so much time and effort in developing the international game through a World Cup only to trash it all as soon as the final is over, but those are the rules Rugby League has chosen to adopt.
That means a player like Sonny Bill Williams could play for New Zealand in the 2013 World Cup and then chose to switch their international allegiance to Australia in 2014.
As we have found out recently with Luke Keary the rules that govern State Of Origin eligibility do not take into account where you were born.
Basically, when a player signs an NRL contract they have to fill out a form which determines their eligibility. This form is normally only used when it comes to State Of Origin eligibility.
Keep in mind that Sonny Bill Williams didn't officially sign a contract to return to the NRL until early 2013. It was a one year deal. They had to sign another deal to remain in the NRL.
You might not like the way Sonny Bill Williams is managed, but you have to admit that their management gets the most out of their career without giving a single thought for what anyone else thinks.
I personally don't think it would be beyond Sonny Bill Williams and their management to have filled out their contract in a way that allows them to play State Of Origin in 2014.
Sonny Bill Williams was born in New Zealand. They moved to Australia at a young age, but not young enough to qualify under the current State Of Origin eligibility rules (13). Here is a little wrinkle though… Sonny Bill Williams grandmother is Australian. Technically that fully entitles them to represent Australia in 2014 if they choose to do so under international eligibility rules.
Williams didn't take part in the 2014 Trans-Tasman Test match for New Zealand last weekend. You can say they boycotted the team or that they aren't selected….either way they didn't turn out for them. That means in the eyes of the RLIF (Which is nothing more than a letter head by the way, they have no offices, telephone numbers or even e-mail addresses) Williams is technically a free agent in terms of international football.
Williams represented New South Wales at junior level. Under the old State Of Origin eligibility rules all Williams would have had to do in 2014 is said they wanted to play State Of Origin and that would be it. Under the new rules, they technically don't qualify although I see reasons for them to appeal that decision.
If Williams states that they now want to represent Australia (Who they qualify for thanks to their Grandmother), they could than state that as an Australian eligible representative that resides in New South Wales and who represented New South Wales at junior level, they should be allowed to play for New South Wales at State Of Origin level. The reason they could make this appeal to the NRL? Because the current rules that have been put in place do not really cover a player in Williams position.
It is almost a clash of international eligibility rules and State Of Origin eligibility rules. If you are allowed to switch nations under international rules but not State Of origin rules, that seems a little bit unfair. I agree with it personally but it is an issue that needs to be addressed. Why the State Of Origin eligibility rules would allow a player like David Mead to be eligible to switch from PNG in 2013 to NSW and Australia in 2014, but not allow that from a player that played for New Zealand or England is something I feel a good legal team could break down pretty easily.
It really would be unfair for a player to be eligible to play for Australia, to commit to playing for Australia, but under State Of Origin rules not be allowed to play for a state they represented at junior level.
Now normally you would think that the powers that be would say “Sorry Sonny Bill. We know what you are trying to do, we know you do not intend to play for Australia, we know you are trying to find a loophole in our new rules…but we are standing firm. You do not qualify under these rules and that is the end of that”. I don't have that sort of faith in our games administrators though.
Queensland showed they were willing to lobby for Luke Keary for a few months to try and change the rules so they could play for them. They failed. New South Wales would have a much better argument for Sonny Bill Williams to be allowed to play for them, and knowing Williams is leaving the game at the end of 2014, knowing that their addition to the series would create giant headlines and a lot of money, and knowing that they could let Williams play for New South Wales under the guise of “This is a loophole in the current rules that we have to fix by allowing Australian eligible players to be able to play for their state”, I can see it happening!
Do I agree with it? Hell no! Do I want to see this happen? Of course not!
These weird wrinkles in the State Of Origin eligibility rules that don't allow you to play for the state you were born in, or allow a player who is eligible to play for Australia but not be eligible to play Origin at all, are something that needs to be looked at. I've stated time and time again that I think for the health of Rugby League in Australia you should only play for the Kangaroo's if you were born in Australia, and that at State Of Origin level you should only play for the state you were born in.
Of course, none of this matters at all if on their NRL contract Sonny Bill Williams made it clear they only wanted to represent New Zealand. While they are one of many international players to express their desire to play in the State Of Origin series, it doesn't mean they would actually fight hard to force their way into the New South Wales side.
Still, it makes you question whether the current State Of Origin eligibility rules go far enough. I really would be strange to see a player elect to play for Australia based on the “grandparent rule” and yet have them not qualify for New South Wales or Queensland even though they played junior football in one of those states.
I can't imagine that Williams or the NSWRL would so brazenly try to undermine the new State Of Origin eligibility rules. Then again, Queensland has a player born and raised in NSW in their side who played all of their junior football in NSW and who first represented NSW at junior level. Under any rules that have ever been in place Greg Inglis doesn't qualify for Queensland, so stranger things have happened!
I hope for the last remaining shreds of credibility the State Of Origin eligibility rules have, this doesn't happen. Then again, part of me kinda wants to see the shit storm it would create.
Lets hope Sonny Bill Williams is just a spectator come State Of Origin time. Hopefully from a New South Wales point of view they can invite Mitchell Pearce over to watch the game with him!

“I remember as a young rabbi working with university students in Johannesburg in the late 1970's. At that time, they were completely apathetic to Judaism. My colleagues and I were struggling to elicit any meaningful response to Jewish programs on campus. During one particular meeting, we seriously contemplated getting up in the dead of night to spray-paint some swastikas on the Student Union building. Surely, that would get some reaction! ”
~~~ Rabbi Yossy Goldman
“The French philosopher, Jean Paul Sartre, argued that anti-Semitism has been good for the Jews. It has kept Jews Jewish! While no one wants to be oppressed, and we reject anti-Semititsm categorically, the man does have a point. When antisemitism bites, we intuitively know how to respond. But when the world is in a kissing mood, we don't quite know how to handle it. ”

Nothing should make a futurist more wary than looking at the history of the profession and seeing how hilarious its mistakes have been. Jetpacks, flying cars, death rays…the future isn't quite what the past hoped it would be. Of course, when predictions do come true it can be really shocking. I thought I'd treat you to some of the more entertaining and eye-opening videos that show classic predictions from the 1960s. Check them out below. The Jet Age couldn't imagine the Age of Social Media clearly, but they got a few things right. And many more hilariously wrong.
This first clip, identified as created in 1966 speculated as to what the typical American household would be like in the far off year of 1999. Remarkably it predicts the importance of the household computer quite accurately. It also does fairly well anticipate Amazon, e-commerce, e-banking, webcams, emails and faxes, and spreadsheets (Quicken, maybe?). The hardware and design is completely off, but the ideas are all there, which is pretty amazing. Even the final segment, which supposes the home computer to updated automatically, is right…it just supposes those upgrades will come via hardware rather than the continuous stream of software patches that we have going on in the background today.
Less accurate is this 1960s vision of “Britain of the Future!” Though they manage to predict flat screen televisions hanging on walls around 6:56, the rest is pretty ludicrous. I mean, how hilarious would it be if we actually selected our children for mathematical and scientific talents so they could better interact with computers? …Wait, a second…
Of course, no vision of the future probably got as much press as Disney's Tomorrowland. The House of the Future was funded by Monsanto who now is a scarily powerful biotech and genetically modified food conglomerate but who in the 1960s was all about plastics. As you'll quickly be able to tell from the next two videos which give us a tour of the House of the Future in all its polyethylene glory.
What strikes me about the House of the Future (besides its specialized compartments for irradiated food!) is how mobile, compact, and mechanized it is. Moving sinks and rotating pantries – society eschewed such developments for suburban sprawl, and frozen food, I guess. Or perhaps the predictions simply aimed too early. With the rise of more advanced robotics we could see a much more mechanized house in the next few decades. Or not. After watching these videos I feel much less inclined to make any predictions whatsoever.
Over the past few years, Singularity Hub has seen the work of futurists of many different calibers. While some, like Arthur C. Clarke or Ray Kurzweil, have impressive track records, no one that repeatedly makes public predictions can do so without creating a few bloopers as well. As all of us technophiles continue to look forward to the future we should be selective in which hype we choose to believe. Even the most advanced scientific minds can have their plans for the future thwarted by unforeseeable events.

Today we are very excited to announce the launch of a new stand-alone product, Elite Dangerous: Arena. Arena is the PVP mode already in Elite Dangerous so all players who own Elite Dangerous or Elite Dangerous: Horizons will already have access to it. Simply select Arena (previously labelled CQC) from the in-game main menu to play.
However, we believe Elite Dangerous: Arena is a compelling game in its own right and want to offer it to players whose main goal is to play fast paced PVP space combat action. This will open Elite Dangerous to a whole new group of players, all of whom you can play against in the Close Quarter Combat Championships (CQC) in Arena mode in Elite Dangerous and Elite Dangerous: Horizons. So if you haven't played CQC already we have a number of challenges starting today that you can join in with.
Elite Dangerous: Arena is available to new players right now on our store and on steam for £4.99/$7.49.
Click here to learn more about Arena.
Mayhem Launch Celebrations
To celebrate today's launch we decided to run a series of events for everybody who can play CQC to get involved in.
- CQC Mayhem – Visit our blog post on the Elite Dangerous community site to see our huge schedule of Mayhem events, and to find out how you can get involved.
- Official Launch Livestream – Three hours of CQC with the developers starting at 6PM GMT on our official YouTube Channel. Come and test your skills against six different members of the development team, and be in the chance of winning prizes for taking part.
- The Gladiators Challenge – During the first four weeks after the launch of Arena (16 February – 15 March), three named accounts beginning with ‘FDEV' will be playing CQC on an ad hoc, but regular, basis. If you manage to get in a game with them, and take a screenshot, you will be entered into a prize draw to win one of two premium Elite Dangerous goodie bags, including a cap, a beanie, three faction mugs, signed artwork, and more. Every paint job in the Elite Dangerous store is also up for grabs, and a couple of Elite Dangerous: Horizons Season passes. There will be a total of five prizes given out – the draw will be done on March 16.
To be in the chance to win, all you have to do is get into a CQC match with either FDEV Rhino, FDEV Wolf or FDEV Jet, take a screenshot of you playing against them (perhaps the leaderboard at the ened of the game), and email it to community@frontier.co.uk with the subject line ‘CQC Gladiators'. Your email address will be added to the list of entries, and winners will be drawn at random at the end of the four weeks.

European Union foreign ministers have formally adopted an "unprecedented" oil embargo against Iran over its nuclear programme, banning all new oil contracts with the country.
They also agreed a freeze on the assets of Iran's central bank in the EU.
The EU currently buys about 20% of Iran's oil exports.
There was no official Iranian reaction, but one Iranian lawmaker played down the decision, calling it a "mere propaganda gesture".
Iran had "failed to restore international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme", British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a joint statement.
"We will not accept Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon. Iran has so far had no regard for its international obligations and is already exporting and threatening violence around its region," the leaders added.
The measures were "another strong step in the international effort to dramatically increase the pressure on Iran," US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement welcoming the move.
Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN's nuclear watchdog has confirmed it is sending a team to Iran between 29 and 31 January "to resolve all outstanding substantive issues".
Last November the IAEA said in a report that it had information suggesting Iran had carried out tests "relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device" - sparking the decision by the US and EU to issue tougher sanctions.
Tehran insists its nuclear programme is for energy purposes.
Earlier on Monday, the Pentagon said the US aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, as well as a British Royal Navy frigate and a French warship, had passed through the Strait of Hormuz at the entrance to the Gulf without incident, in the wake of Iranian threats to block the trade route.
'Substantial impact'
The EU said the sanctions prohibit the import, purchase and transport of Iranian crude oil and petroleum products as well as related finance and insurance. All existing contracts will have to be phased out by 1 July.
Investment as well as the export of key equipment and technology for Iran's petrochemical sector is also banned.
Additional restrictions have been placed on Iran's central bank and in the trade of gold, precious metals and diamonds.
BBC Europe Editor Gavin Hewitt says it is one of the toughest steps the EU has ever taken.
Analysis So once the new measures are in place how successful will they be? Even western diplomats are uncertain. There is no doubting that the Iranian economy will suffer. But the nuclear programme is a matter of national pride and ultimately national security. Iran has seen the demise of regimes in Iraq and Libya and noted the survival of that in North Korea - the one so-called "rogue state" that has nuclear weapons. Iran's rulers may well believe that having at least the potential for a nuclear bomb is something that could secure the country against outside threat. Seen in this light one can imagine the Iranian authorities being willing to absorb considerable economic pain to pursue their nuclear research effort. Impact of EU ban on Iranian oil
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said the purpose of the sanctions was "to put pressure on Iran to come back to the negotiating table".
Earlier, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said the embargo showed "the resolve of the European Union on this issue".
"It is absolutely right to do this when Iran is continuing to breach United Nations resolutions and refusing to come to meaningful negotiations on its nuclear programme," they added.
But the Russian foreign ministry said it was a "deeply mistaken" move that would not encourage Iran to return to the negotiating table.
"It's apparent that in this case there is open pressure and diktat, aimed at "punishing" Iran," it said in a statement.
Ali Adyani, a member of the Iranian parliament's energy commission, was quoted by the semi-official Fars news agency as saying the EU decision "would only serve some American and European politicians".
"It will not have any effect on Iran's economy," they said, adding that Tehran could sell oil to "any country" despite the ban.
Rising tensions
BBC Iran correspondent James Reynolds says oil is the country's most valuable asset and sales help to keep the Iranian government in money and power.
A decision by the EU to stop buying from Iran may damage the Iranian economy - but in itself it won't destroy it, our correspondent says.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's James Reynolds visits Dubai where many people export goods to Iran
Iran sells most of its oil to countries in Asia. The EU and the United States are now working to persuade Asian countries to reduce their purchases from Iran as well.
Iran has already threatened to retaliate by blocking the Strait of Hormuz at the entrance to the Gulf, through which 20% of the world's oil exports pass.
The US has said it will keep the trade route open, raising the possibility of a confrontation.
Late last year Iran conducted 10 days of military exercises near the Strait of Hormuz, test-firing several missiles.
Oil prices have risen already because of the increasing tension and the expected impact of an EU ban on oil supplies to Europe.
Q: Generally, what's the difference between Batman and Detective Comics ? I've heard right now Detective is going to focus more on the Batman Family, has that always been true? -- Anonymous, via tumblr
A: This is a very interesting question, because it doesn't just have to do with how the Batman titles work. It has to do with how every character with multiple monthly titles works, and the question of whether it's necessary to make those multiple titles distinct or just have them form a single ongoing narrative. It's something that you can see approached in almost every way you can approach it across multiple characters and creative teams from different eras, from Superman and Spider-Man to the X-Men , and it has a lot to do with how the approach to superheroic storytelling has changed over the past 75 years.
But let's be real here. If you've read this column before, then you already know that we're mostly just going to be talking about how it works for Batman.
So to answer your second question first, yes: Traditionally speaking, Detective Com ics is the book that widens the scope beyond just focusing on Batman, which has been the case for as long as there's been a Detective comic --- even longer, in fact, than there's been a Batman.
See, much like Action Comics , or All-Star , or Adventure Comics , or Marvel Comics , or USA Comics , or virtually any other title that made its debut back in the Golden Age, Detective started out as an anthology title. After #27 rolled around, of course, Batman quickly became the most popular feature, but it was a long time before the book fully gave up on those roots and switched over to only featuring Batman --- a lot longer, if memory serves, than it took Action Comics to become an exclusively Superman-themed title.
As for why, well, if you were in the market for a comic that only had Batman stories, there was Batman . Detective , if for no other reason than by virtue of its more generic title, was able to cast a much wider net, with stuff like hard-hitting private eye Slam Bradley, the super-powered police officer that is the Martian Manhunter , the relatively crime-focused Human Target, and Simon and Kirby's Boy Commandos, which admittedly stretched the definition of "detective" to its breaking point.
Eventually, though, somebody at DC realized that nobody was really showing up to a book that always had Batman on the cover for stories about Roy Raymond. In 1969, with Batmania finally (Bruce) waning with the cancellation of the TV series, the Elongated Man departed from the pages of Detective Comics to make room for more Robin and Batgirl stories.
It was a short-lived departure, as these things go, and there were a few other backups that popped up here and there --- the biggest stretch of the era probably being that time the Atom showed up and was billed as "The World's Smallest Sleuth," but none of them really stuck. Then, in 1978, during a time when 'Tec had been knocked back to being bimonthly, it officially became a Batman Family book once again, picking up from the short-lived Batman Family after the infamous DC Implosion. They even changed the logo on the cover from "Batman's Detective Comics" to the one you can see above.
Admittedly, though, the definition of "Batman Family" was a little weird at times.
I mean, as much as I don't want to, I'm willing to give you Man-Bat. The Demon, on the other hand?
Anyway, while the cover treatment was short-lived, the backups stuck around for a while, until they finally went out with a pretty huge bang in Detective Comics #500. That issue's probably best known for Alan Brennert and Dick Giordano 's "To Kill A Legend," a strong contender for the Best Batman Story Ever Written, and Len Wein and Walt Simonson 's "Once Upon A Time," but it also featured Wein and Jim Aparo 's "The Too Many Cooks Caper." It's exactly the kind of story you'd expect from the 500th issue of a book called Detective Comics , built around the murder of a cop that ends up being investigated by all of their friends, who just happen to be the detective characters who had appeared in the comic over the past 43 years.
Slam Bradley, Roy Raymond, Captain Compass, Jason Bard, Pow-Wow Smith, the Human Target, Mysto, it's the entire bunch of 'em. Well, all of them except J'onn J'onzz and the Elongated Man, I mean, but since they had a solo story later in the issue (from Mike W. Barr and Jose Luis Garcia-Lopez , no less), I think it's okay.
But while that might've marked the end of the regular backups, it certainly wasn't the last time that Detective would be used to put the spotlight onto the larger Batman Family. From 2000 to 2003, backup stories made a brief return, including "Trail of the Catwoman," a Slam Bradley story by Ed Brubaker and Darwyn Cooke that served as a prelude to their relaunch of Catwoman . And, perhaps even more notably, 2009 saw Batwoman taking over the lead role, marking the first time in 70 years that Batman didn't have the starring role in Detective .
So yeah, the Rebirth -era book's focus on the larger Batman Family is far from unprecedented. But even when Batman was the star, even when they were focused on Batman as a solo character operating without their extended gaggle of sidekicks, there have still been attempts at making those core titles feel distinct.
Which brings us back around to your first question: what's the difference between Batman and Detective ? And what that difference is --- and whether there's a difference at all --- usually just comes down to the creators on the books and the editorial direction behind them.
For a long time --- for most of the character's history, even --- there hasn't really been much of one to speak of. The only major distinction was the one we've already talked about, in that Detective had space for other characters, while Batman remained more focused. Other than that, the stories were essentially interchangeable. If you wanted something that felt really different, you had to go to Brave and the Bold , which served as the team-up book that mixed Batman in with the rest of the DC Universe --- and, since it was usually being produced by Bob Haney and Jim Aparo, it was also the source of some of the weirdest Batman stories ever printed.
Brave and the Bold #115
What, you don't remember that time Batman died and the Atom reanimated their corpse by jumping around on their brain to make them punch out criminals until they came back to life? Because that thing oughtta be taught in schools.
Anyway, there were different approaches that popped up here and there over the years, but by the time we got to the early '90s, it started to feel like it was necessary to make them feel more distinct. Thanks to the overwhelming popularity of the character and the shift to the defined weekly release schedule that came with the rise of direct-market comic book stores, characters like Batman and Superman (and Spider-Man, for example) could support a new issue every week. And while Superman mostly just stuck to telling a single episodic story across four or five titles, Batman was a little different.
Incidentally, Superman wasn't always like that. When the franchise was rebooted after Crisis , Superman was relaunched as the flagship book that was meant to redefine the character, with the newly retitled Adventures of Superman serving as the secondary book to fill out the rest of the story, and Action Comics rebranded as a team-up book. It wasn't until after the Action Comics Weekly era, where DC took what was arguably its last real stab at a superhero anthology title, that the book settled into the regular weekly episodes that would carry it through "The Death and Return of Superman " and the Electric Blue era , lasting up through the soft reboot in 1999 and a concerted (if short-lived) attempt to give each title its own flavor. Y'know, just in case you were curious.
As for how it worked for the Batman books, well, it's probably better to take the word of someone who was actually there. Here's what Alan Grant said about it in their introduction to the Shadow of the Bat: The Last Arkham paperback, originally printed in 1995 but handily included in the version that came out just a few weeks ago:
We were in upstate New York on one of our biannual Batman retreats, planning future stories, continuity, annuals, and one-shots. Batman maestro Dennis O'Neil, never one to stand on ceremony, began the meeting briskly: "We want to publish another regular Batman comic. Alan -- you'll be the writer. Norm -- you're the artist. Anybody has any good ideas for a title?" Doug Moench and I did, and so Shadow of the Bat was born. We needed a new angle for the comic -- Batman monthly ran the regular continuity stories, Detective Comics was more "what Batman did on their nights off from the monthly," and Legends of the Dark Knight focused on events in our hero's past. So what would be different about Shadow ? The title provided it: the shadow of the Bat would fall on various heroes or villains, putting someone new under the spotlight in each story arc.
Of course, that didn't quite stick. As the decade went on, crossovers drove the line, and by the time we got to 1999 and No Man's Land , the books had become the same kind of interchangeable titles that you saw in the Superman books. Four part stories by a single creative team would pretty frequently just run through one issue of each comic, and let me tell you, that made trying to put those things together from back issue boxes a real pain.
Once NML was over, though, the Batman titles were relaunched with a new direction that actually seemed to last. Legends of the Dark Knight went back to focusing on the past, and Shadow was replaced with Gotham Knights , which served as that era's Batman Family book, and those two core titles were given a very strong identity: Batman is the superhero book, and Detective is the crime book. For certain nebulous values of "crime" that usually still include people with mind-control hats and ice guns.
For Batman , it's a distinction that seems to have lasted --- and if you need proof, you don't really need to look any further than the past five years on the book and Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo 's pretty relentless dedication to going as far over the top as they possibly could. Before that, it's where Grant Morrison and Andy Kubert launched the run that involved ninja man-bats and the Club of Heroes. And before that , it's where we had "Hush," which, for all its flaws, is about as much of a superhero comic as you can get.
For Detective , it's been a little less consistent, largely because there always seems to be something else filling its role. I mean, really, when Gotham Central 's around, nobody else really needs to focus on street-level super-crime.
Point being, despite its status as the comic that gave us Batman and ended up having the whole darn company named after it --- maybe even because of that --- Detective has always been a little more adaptable than its counterpart. There have been plenty of times when the books have told the same sort of story, but Detective putting the focus onto another aspect of Batman is nothing new.
And it's also really good right now.

Several groups are calling on the province to tighten groundwater laws as B.C. is the only jurisdiction in Canada that does not charge major corporations for groundwater use.
Nestle is bottling and selling up to 265 million litres of water from the area around Hope, B.C., every year for free, says Sheila Muxlow of the WaterWealth Project.
That's nearly the size of seven Olympic-sized swimming pools, they add, and Nestle is one of several multinationals bottling B.C.'s fresh water.
"Outside of the fact that they are draining the size of a small lake on an annual basis without any sort of accountability… this is a microcosm of a larger failure with the way B.C.'s water is managed."
Currently, British Columbia has no regulation on groundwater use. Corporations can extract as much ground water as they like without any fees.
Muxlow says no studies have been done to measure the environmental impact of draining that quantity of water every year, and not enough is being done to monitor and regulate the extraction of water.
But Nestle, the largest seller of bottled water in the world, says it is acting responsibly and contributing to the B.C. economy.
"Aquifers are not bath tubs. They're water systems deep in the ground that are constantly moving, they're constantly replenishing," says John Challinor, a spokesperson for Nestle.
"We're investing millions of dollars in that plant. We employ 75 people [and] we pay millions of dollars in taxes," they added.
Challinor says Nestle would be willing to pay for the resource, as long as everybody else did.
The B.C. Environment Ministry says it plans to introduce new regulations next year.

It's money time for 31 former Nittany Lions as they head into NFL training camps over the next few days.
So, who's the highest-paid Penn Stater now playing in the pros?
It depends on how you show me the money:
You can go by how much money a player is guaranteed – meaning he'll get that money, no matter what happens, including an injury or getting cut.
Major League Baseball guarantees much of a player's contract. It's a lot rarer in the NFL. Which is why ex-Penn State defensive tackle Jared Odrick really hit the jackpot in the off-season.
Odrick jumped from the Miami Dolphins to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Odrick signed for $42.5 million over five seasons, but what really counts is that he's guaranteed to make at least $22.5 million over the next several years.
That's more guaranteed bank than any other ex-Nittany Lion. Odrick is followed by Dolphins defensive end Cameron Wake ($17 million) and Cowboys linebacker Sean Lee ($16.13 million), both of whom are also guaranteed eight figures. That guaranteed money is especially key for Lee, who missed 2014 with a torn anterior cruciate ligament and has played in just 17 of the last 48 regular-season games. They last played a game in December 2013.
Biggest contract? That's a different story.
Overall, San Francisco 49ers linebacker NaVorro Bowman – coming back in 2015 after missing all of all 2014 with significant knee injuries – enters the NFL preseason with the largest overall contract of any Penn Stater. Bowman, a former All-Pro, has a five-year deal for $45.25 million. That's an average of $9.05 million per season. Bowman has the biggest overall contract as well as the highest per-season average paycheck of any former Penn Stater.
NUMBERS FROM SPOTRAC.COM
All numbers for this story are courtesy of a really cool website, Spotrac.com, which tracks salaries for the NFL, MLB, NBA, NAL and MLS. According to the site, “Spotrac has become the largest online sports team, & player contract resource on the internet. The system was founded by Michael Ginnitti & Scott Allen in 2007 as an internal tool to facilitate fantasy sports, and answer every day questions about player financials. Since then it's grown exponentially into a team payroll, player valuation, and overall research tool for a variety of audience groups with the sports business community.”
Penn State is spot-on in the NFL when it comes to defense. Former Nittany Lions who star on defense dominate the money list, as on a per-year average, the six highest-paid Nittany Lions all play defense. And No. 7 is veteran Chicago Bears kicker Robbie Gould. Rookie offensive tackle Donovan Smith, at $1.52 million per year, is the highest paid offensive player from PSU in the NFL ($3.9 million of their four-year, $6.07-million contract is guaranteed).
You do have to like the one-year deal that Kansas City linebacker Tamba Hali has -- $6 million, and $5 million of it is guaranteed. It ain't always like that, though. Of the 31 Penn Staters entering NFL campus this month, nine won't receive a cent if they don't make the roster, while Garry Gilliam's contract with Seattle has a guarantee of only $12,000.
Among Penn Staters who are rookies in 2015, Smith is followed by safety Adrian Amos, drafted by the Chicago Bears ($2.512 million, contract, $232,268 guaranteed) and tight end Jesse James, drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers ($2.489 million, $208,912).

George Galloway spoke Bradford's language last night as they won a landslide victory in a by-election in Bradford West. With an overwhelming majority of over 10,000 this serves as a massive blow to the Labour party which comes after a particularly catastrophic week for the Coalition.
Only three weeks ago did Galloway ride into Bradford to carry out a campaign that has led to political pandemonium. They lured out over 50% of the electorate, a percentage unheard of especially in an urban by-election. Reports have said that 10,000 votes had been cast in the week running up to the election by post. This has resounding implications across the board highlighting integral failings of the Labour party and a growing mood of impatience from the electorate.
The landslide is a particular shock as Bradford West is one of the strongest Labour seats in the country having been held for the past four decades. Conservatives last night stated they hoped for a victory by splitting the Labour vote, however after a disastrous week coupled with the mood of the Bradford west demographic, realistically they never stood a chance. The results ultimately speak for themselves, the Tories managed a slim 2, 746 compared with Galloway's 18, 341 and even Labours 8, 201.
While this is a personal political victory for Galloway who lost out in the General election in 2010, the swing against the for Labour party draws unwanted attention to Ed Milliband's lack of success in capitalising on a disastrous week for the coalition. Milliband was well positioned to reach out to the electorate after Tory elitism was yet again exposed in ‘Pasty-gate.' Their inability to respond or engage other than a futile trip to Gregg's has given rise to their capabilities as a leader.
Bradford is by no means an accurate illustration of the political mood of the country however there are some conspicuous clues that mainstream politics is in for a real fight to convince the electorate of their competence and integrity.
Last night was not the first time Galloway has grappled with the Labour party and succeeded. In the 2005 general election they perilously plucked Bow, an east London seat from their former political flame, subverting a 10,000 majority held by Oona King. They tactically targeted the votes of the large Asian community and they have used the same methods to win Bradford West.
Never far from controversy and scandal they claim their victory in Bradford can be traced back to “the path of treason by Tony Blair in 2004” Galloway's campaign trail saw them gratify their audiences of largely Asian men with a consummate effort to talk “their language” so to speak. Their speeches began with “salam alikhum” and were accented with the odd “inshallah” and “mashallah” which refers to gods good will. Even their victory tweet referred to the the divine stating: “by the grace of God we have won a most sensational victory in British political history.”
The vigour of their campaign and their sensational victory described by them as the “Bradford Spring” has certainly awoken Bradford and successfully convinced them of their democratic power to change the course of political history. Perhaps Bradford is the only place a victory of this scale would ever be possible in the UK. Talk of revolutions and justice in speeches by George Galloway was not wasted on the ears of Bradford west as many of them feel a raw sense of outrage and sadness for those have fought for freedom from repression under despotic regimes throughout Muslim countries. Galloway's campaign was unmistakable aligned with an international sense of anger at the way Muslims have suffered. They call for an immediate withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, promises to oppose a war in Iran and continue campaigning against western imperialist interventions and they have articulated loud and clear their solidarity with Palestine.
Their approach has not been without note or criticism which in true Galloway-esqe style has seen them threaten to sue a Bradfordian Labour councillor after they claimed they libelled them over a text with “highly-defamatory allegations.” This came after they were accused of desperate measures to secure the Muslim vote by claiming they had never touched alcohol and had always shown solidarity with Muslims at home and abroad. One Bradford south resident complained that they found it disconcerting that the campaign trail had led to people handing out Respect party material outside the Suffa-Tul-Islam mosque in Sunbridge Road last Friday.Trainee solicitor Waqar Ali said: “The mosque has no political affiliation with anyone.”
Nevertheless Galloway must be commended on their ability to tap into and articulate the mood of the Bradford west constituents. The area itself is made up of 47% non whites with 38% classifying themselves as Muslim. Galloway no doubt cleverly judged the demographic as having strong potential for the Respect party even stating that this fight could be “won by minorities.” They have been accurate in their analysis of Bradford stating that “the city centre is filled with pound shops, pawn shops and payday loan shows” they went on to say that “there is mass unemployment, somebody coming from outside and offering a new start is an electoral plus.”
Their statements of Bradford have been true and poignant, there is an atmosphere of stagnation which has arguable never recovered from the riots in 2001. Lack of investment has had a knock on effect for the population through lack of jobs, progress and opportunity. As a result there has been a lean-to the right and an increase in radicalism. The BNP and smaller factions such as the EDL have played on economic fears and the feeling of disconnection by arguable scape-goating Muslims and immigrants. Equally many more radical Muslims have been able to reach out and play on fears of diminishing morality and accountability in society that has similarly driven segregations deeper.
Bradford is fraught with tensions of all kinds and undoubtedly the illusion of a firm hand that will fight guns blazing for Bradford is going to be met with confidence, hero-worship and glorification. However, Galloway needs to prove themselves to Bradford because in three years they will be called to show what they have accomplished.
So whaddya know? The supposed "us and them" war raging twixt cyclists and drivers is actually more love-in than pitched battle.
As the editor of performance car website and associated forum PistonHeads I should know, having recently posted a blog about my new-found love of road cycling on the homepage and received … nothing but enthusiastic support.
Now, on the surface, sites like PistonHeads would appear to be the last bastion for petrol guzzling horsepower junkies with views on cycling somewhere to the right of Jeremy Clarkson or James Martin.
We write about and discuss cars – mainly fast, noisy and extravagant ones – but among the vast, diverse and extremely vocal community there thrives a strong pro-cycling spirit that happily pours scorn on the idea you're either a driver or a rider. As the bike-mad editor I saw no problem posting a story about my born-again roadie awakening and drawing comparisons with that and my love of fast cars. And I was vindicated with an enthusiastic response from the forums.
A few more reactionary PistonHeads members have been caught out by the surprisingly pro-cycling vibe, too. We had one member post a foul-mouthed rant about being overtaken in queuing traffic by "some dopey little fucker on a bike" on a visit to Oxford, clearly expecting a shower of supportive anti-cyclist sentiment. And yet, within five comments, another member came on and said: "Ah poor boo hoo got overtaken by a cyclist. Did it make your winky shrink?" Probably not the response they were expecting on a car forum. And hugely encouraging for those of us dismayed any time "war on the roads" type headlines appear. Again.
Dan Trent in a more familiar pose
You don't have to look far for further examples. Cycling is a popular off-season training aid for racing drivers at all levels. Many – Red Bull F1 driver Mark Webber and nine-time world rally championship winner Sebastien Loeb among them – are clearly in it for the love of the sport as much as the fitness benefits.
Tie-ups between carmakers and bike firms have seen a transfer of technology too, Lotus famously collaborating with Mike Burrows on Chris Boardman's distinctive track bike at the 1992 Olympics, and McLaren and Specialized teaming up on the Venge range of road bikes to pool expertise in aerodynamics and carbon fibre. Pound the floor of any motor show and no concept car with "lifestyle" pretensions dare show its face without some manner of inventive bike portage system either.
carmakers aren't dumb, of course, and now recognise that in this day and age an extravagant road bike is as much a default mid-life crisis purchase as the bright red Porsche. A shared love of speed, carbon fibre and unnecessarily extravagant expenditure see to that. And, yes, one of my riding buddies has both, investing a four-figure sum in a Porsche-branded roof rack so they can carry their custom-built Independent Fabrications road bike on their 911.
All of which goes to show that lazy stereotyping is exactly that, while selfish, idiotic behaviour isn't dependent on the number of wheels on which you roll or how they're powered. James Martin would still be James Martin, whether at the wheel of a Maserati or dressed in Lycra and puffing away on a Colnago. The rest of us are happy to confound accepted "wisdom" and prove cars and bikes can get along just fine, thanks.
Mumbai: Raymond McCauley is chair, Digital Biology at Singularity University—a Silicon Valley think tank devoted to training leaders in exponential technologies.  They are also part of the team that developed next generation DNA sequencing at Illumina, where they worked in bioinformatics, cancer sequencing, and personal genomics. In an email interview, McCauley—who is a speaker at the two-day SingularityU India Summit that begins on 7 April—spoke about the explosion in genomics research, gene editing tools like CRISPR-CAS9 and the consequences of bioinformatics and genetic testing on health and life insurance. Edited excerpts:
The explosion in genomics research along with the widespread adoption of DNA sequencing is accelerating the growth of the genomics market across the globe. Have we reached an inflection point?
As the price continues to drop for DNA sequencing, and all of the associated tools and services, we are seeing a larger market for those services really take off. The research market is strong, as always, and many new medical applications are driving new growth. And we're actually seeing an explosion of consumer genetics—people can use their genes to look at ancestry, optimize nutrition and athletic training, and even pick a good tasting wine.
Gene sequencing and gene editing (CRISPR CAS-9) are playing huge roles in the push toward personalized medicine and healthcare. Provide us with some applications of genomics.
Now that we are able to read and write DNA fairly cheaply, with even more advances to come, we can use this to help personalize medical care. Consider these examples. Pharmacogenomics uses genetic information to determine what drugs and dosages work for each person. This pays off quickly because taking the wrong drug, or a drug that actually causes an adverse reaction, is an expensive, and sometimes tragic, mistake. And it's now cheap to read DNA. We all have hereditary tendencies for things like heart disease, neurological disease, and cancer locked away in our genes. Knowing your individual risks with chronic disease prediction, means you can be better prepared to prevent actually getting sick.
In the field of cancer diagnostics, new liquid biopsies can look at free-floating DNA in a simple blood sample, and sometimes identify cancer before it would show up on a body scan. Moreover, by genetically engineering a person's bone marrow cells, we can basically reprogram their immune system, and their circulatory system. Some new cancer treatments are based on this. Further, looking at the DNA of the collection of microbes in your gut can help with digestive disorders, weight loss, even understanding mood changes.
What are the consequences of bioinformatics and genetic testing on health and life insurance?
Being able to predict health and lifespan with genomic tools pretty much breaks insurance. It turns the information asymmetry, where actuaries know more about how long you'll live, on its head. Because they can only predict how long people live on average. There's a chance, though, for these companies to use this technology to help their clients make better decisions, and get access to better treatments, and live longer.
Could you point out some of the opportunities and consequences of, what you describe as, “drag & drop" genetic editing?
The first and biggest changes that come here are in industrial microbiology, where we reprogram single-celled creatures to manufacture things for us, like plastics and biofuels and even complex products like medicine and computers—and also to mine and recycle these materials. It also makes it easier to do engineering and enhancement on plants and animals, for agriculture, and also on humans, for medicine and enhancement, then finally, on the environment itself. Think about using this technology to produce mosquitoes that can't pass along malaria, or to reverse greenhouse gas increases and ocean acidification.
What steps are being taken to address some of the challenges arising out of fields like bioinformatics and bioengineering like privacy and legal hurdles?
Some enlightened polities are passing laws to prevent discrimination by the government or employers based on genetic information, and to give individuals some control over who can access their information. This is particularly important for insurance, and who is allowed to access genetic databases built for different purposes.
But, policy-wise, it's still the early days. Should law enforcement be allowed to scan databases built for research or health practitioners to go fishing to find someone who may have been at the scene of a crime? Should a sports team test their prospective athletes for hidden heart disease genes before signing a multi-million dollar contract? Do people have a right to ‘not' know about health problems or secrets in their family tree, and what if siblings disagree about this? Many questions remain to be resolved. And it's likely that different groups and nations will come up with different best answers.
How can a country like India take advantage of genomics research?
India has more trained bioinformaticists than any other country on earth. These people, who are trained to use computers in the life sciences, and systems biologists, and biostatisticians, are the heroes of the coming biotech revolution. They keep it moving forward. Professionals here are uniquely positioned to both contribute to pushing this technology forward, and to make a huge amount of money, for themselves and the economy, while doing it. India also has a pharmaceutical industry that serves as an example to the rest of the world—where the entrepreneurs and the policymakers have done much figured out how to balance making money with the needs of the people to receive affordable health care.
Glossary for laypersons
1. Genome sequencing
Getting a read-out of an individual organism's entire DNA sequence. For humans, this is about 3.2 billion bases, spread across 23 chromosomes. Useful for research, and for personalized medicine. This is how we read the blueprint of life.
2. De novo sequencing
Looking at a species genome for the first time. It's always more difficult to sequence the first member of a species. This is harder, because we read DNA in short sections, and we have to figure out how all the sections connect.
3. Resequencing
Looking at an individual's DNA, when you've already got examples of that species DNA sequence, called a reference sequence, to compare it to. Sometimes, individual genes or groups of genes are targeted and sequenced, without looking at the entire genome.
4. Exome sequencing
Looking at just the genes, or portion of the DNA that codes for proteins (about 1% in humans) or the portion that is thought to be involved in regulating genes (about 10% in humans).
5. RNA sequencing
The DNA is the read-only memory of the cell, and when new proteins need to be made, the cell copies the appropriate genes' DNA into RNA. All cells, from bone cells to brain cells, have basically the same DNA, but they don't always turn on, or express, the same genes. By sequencing the RNA, we get a snapshot of what proteins the different kinds of cells express at different times. We call this gene expression, or sometimes RNAseq, for short. Useful for research, and responsible for about half the research sequencing done.
6. Methylation sequencing
One way of understanding gene expression, sometimes referred to as the epigenome. There's a level of gene regulation in DNA, where special stretches of DNA are methylated (have a special chemical group added to them), to keep nearby genes turned off. Useful for research, especially in understanding cancer, which sometimes sneakily figures out ways to change this and turn growth genes on.
7. CHIP sequencing
A special research method for finding which proteins grab which stretches of DNA, so we can understand better how the cellular machinery works together. Not done on a computer chip, but this is an acronym for Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation.
8. MicroRNA sequencing
Another research method for understanding gene expression, by looking at short pieces of RNA that float around the cell and turn off groups of genes.
9. Microbiome sequencing
Looking at the DNA in entire groups of tiny organisms, like all of the microbes in your gut, or all of the microbes in an environmental sample. It's like a population census for bacteria. New uses for this are being found in agriculture and biomanufacturing. Sometimes called metagenomics.
10. Barcode sequencing
Looking at a short stretch of DNA, to identify a species, like scanning a printed barcode in a market. Used for diagnosing infections, environmental research, and even protecting endangered species.
The United Nations has asked the Syrian government to allow the 400 Syrians to be airlifted out of Madaya, where medical charity MSF says 28 people have starved to death since December 1.
"They need medical evacuation on an urgent basis tonight and they want permission from the government of Syria to lift those people out," said New Zealand's Ambassador Gerard van Bohemen.
The UN Security Council was meeting behind closed doors to discuss the situation in the besieged areas where residents told AFP they had resorted to eating grass and killing cats to feed themselves.
UN aid chief Stephen O'Brien told the 15-member council that the 400 Syrians were "in a very critical situation," Spanish Ambassador Roman Oyarzun told reporters.
"If they are not evacuated tonight, the situation will be more than dramatic tomorrow," they said.
US Ambassador Samantha Power said "over 400 people are on the brink of death in need of immediate medical evacuation" from Madaya.
Hours earlier, a convoy of 44 trucks loaded with food, baby formula, blankets and other supplies entered Madaya, which has been under siege by President Bashar al-Assad's forces for six months.
An additional 21 trucks delivered supplies to two other towns besieged by the rebels: Fuaa and Kafraya.
Syria's UN envoy Bashar Jaafari dismissed reports of starvation in Madaya as fabrications and accused "terrorists inside" the town of stealing the supplies.
Britain and France are calling for an end to the sieges.
"Starving civilians is an inhuman tactic used by the Asad regime and their allies," said British Ambassador Matthew Rycroft.
"All sieges must be lifted to save civilian lives and to bring Syria closer to peace," they said in a statement.
The United Nations says it is struggling to deliver aid to about 4.5 million Syrians who live in hard-to-reach areas, including nearly 400,000 people in 15 besieged areas.
French Ambassador Francois Delattre said lifting the sieges was key ahead of a new round of peace talks between Assad's government and the opposition planned for January 25 in Geneva.
"The intra-Syrian negotiations will not resume unless there is an improvement of the civilians' plight," they said.
More than 260,000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government demonstrations.

BLOOMINGTON -- Corey White has a photo of it, snapped from a passing car.
Caleb Anderson experienced it firsthand on the side of a snowy Bloomington road.
Christa Sist-Morris is almost sure she's held it in their hands.
All have been touched by examples of small, random kindnesses paid around the Bloomington community by Indiana men's basketball coach Tom Crean.
"There are so many of those stories like that," said Tom Morris, Christa's husband.
White's story is well-traveled. The Morrises' is, too. Anderson's was chronicled by Louisville sports columnist Rick Bozich in December 2012. Others like them have gone unnoticed.
ANOTHER TOM CREAN
There are, in the public eye, at least two different sides to Tom Crean. One is well-known, broadcast around the country at least 32 times each winter — the fiery, energetic coach, rarely pausing from pacing their sideline.
The other is more subtle, less interested in the spotlight, guided by faith and upbringing.
"It's always been really about being just another human being," Crean said, "really believing, truthfully, what we learn at the very beginning, that God created each and every one of us equal."
Stories of Crean's goodwill are commonplace in Bloomington. If you don't have a personal experience, you probably know someone who does.

• NINE YEARS: IU fires Tom Crean
White's began on Third Street, near the College Mall, where they saw Crean in the parking lot of a McDonald's on a Sunday afternoon in May.
Crean had spotted two people in need. They pulled over, bought them food, spoke with them for a few minutes, and handed them a Bible.
Moved by Crean's generosity, White snapped a quick photo. Jon Jeffries, a co-worker, heard White's story, saw their photo and shared the story on Facebook, where it went viral. One sharing on Twitter received more than 600 retweets.
"It was a wonderful moment to capture," White said.

Friday night had turned to Saturday morning near the end of 2012 when Caleb Anderson decided to chance it and drive home through thick falling snow.
Bloomington had been blanketed with a foot of snow on Christmas, and more was piling up. But Anderson — who had been out that night for IU's nonconference finale against Jacksonville and was at a friend's house — wanted to try.
"We could barely drive out of my friend's neighborhood, because the snow was not plowed," Anderson told The Indianapolis Star.

They wound up in a ditch near Bloomington's eastside post office.
Their night became the subject of Bozich's story. While on the phone telling their mother they were stranded, Anderson saw Crean pull up.
"Mom, it's Tom Crean," they told her, according to Bozich. "He said he'll help me get the car out."
Anderson and Crean worked in vain to try to get their 1992 Honda Accord back on the road. Finally, a high school classmate of Anderson's with a pulley on their truck was able to haul them out of the ditch.
Bozich's story described Crean as "reluctant" to talk about the incident.
"I just saw somebody who needed help and that's what I tried to do," Crean said then. "I'll do it again the next time I see somebody who needs help. I hope somebody would do the same for me or my family."

The Morris' story is well known in Bloomington.
A strength coach at IU, Tom was paralyzed in a mountain biking accident in 2012. The community rallied around Tom and their wife, Christa, raising money to help support them through rehabilitation toward Tom's eventual return to work at Indiana, where they now serves as an assistant athletic director for strength and conditioning/performance.
Several IU coaches, including football's Kevin Wilson and men's soccer's Todd Yeagley, helped rally the Indiana community to support Tom and Christa, who works as an assistant director of academic services and certification for IU athletics.
Crean did, too, raising money for the Morris' "Tom's Team" charity. Publicly, Crean's contributions and support mirrored those of many others around IU and the city. Privately, they went further.
When Crean heard that Tom and Christa's parents were arriving overnight in Indianapolis in the hours after Tom's accident, they booked two rooms at a local hotel, covering their costs for their entire stay.
In Indianapolis for a playoff game between the Pacers and the Miami Heat, Crean gave up tickets to catch their old pupil, Dwyane Wade, so they could watch the game with Morris in their hospital room.
There were moments, too, when the Morrises believe they felt Crean's generosity, even if it went unstated.
Whenever doctors came into Tom's room to update their condition, Christa took notes as meticulously as they could. During one visit, Crean noticed.
Soon after, upon returning to their office, they were given an iPad by their coworkers — a gift Christa firmly believes actually came from Crean.
"He really doesn't want you to know he's doing stuff, which makes it even more amazing," Tom Morris said.
"They're not about the limelight, which a lot of people may think," Christa Sist-Morris said of Crean and their wife, Joani. "He did everything behind the scenes."
****
Stories like these have spread around Bloomington since Crean's arrival more than seven years ago.
Some are more publicized than others.
When Crean and their wife joined the search for missing IU student Lauren Spierer, Crean played down their involvement, directing the attention their presence received toward the search effort.
"It's about doing the right thing," they told a reporter then. "It's about impacting this search. It's about helping this family."
Crean welcomed Brian Jones, an Indiana fan and ALS patient, into a postgame news conference last season, calling Jones "a model of perseverance." The Big Ten Network, among others, reported it.
Once, out to dinner in Bloomington with their family, they quietly paid for the meal of two patrons sitting near them on their way out.

Crean tries to spark the impulse for random acts of kindness in their players, too.

This summer, players volunteered at Camp Riley, a program for children with physical disabilities at Bradford Woods, just north of Bloomington. And Hoosiers spent time visiting children from an Omaha after-school program during their NCAA tournament appearance in March. Crean hopes that these experiences teach their players selflessness and responsibility.
"What I've learned a lot is that you're planting seeds for people, and you hope that it's going to help them see things from a clearer view as they get older," they said.
But Crean's own motivations are more personal.
"When things happen and you have an instinct to encourage or an instinct to help or support, I think you've got to act on it. That's what I've tried to do," they said. "I've probably missed more opportunities to help than I've taken advantage of."
Crean agreed to speak for this story out of encouragement, rather than attention, because paying kindness forward doesn't require a platform or a podium.
Just awareness.
"I don't look at it like it's anything special. We should all be trying to help people where we can," Crean said. "I think the most important thing is that you take your turn when it comes."

“The Bravest Woman in Afghanistan,” Malalai Joya did two CNN interviews on Thursday. Joya is an elected member of the Afghanistan parliament who has been suspended for “insulting fellow members of parliament” in a television interview.  They are articulate and firm in their position that the Western occupation is feeding the violence.
The first interview was broadcast on CNN (US). In the middle of the interview, as Joya made clear they opposed US occupation, interviewer Heidi Collins said “occupation would certainly be your word, a lot of people would take great issue with you calling the US presence in your country an ‘occupation'.” Joya went on to defend their position as Collins' interrupted snidely. As Joya tried to respond to Collins, they were cut off.
The second interview took place on CNN International. Joya's anti-occupation position was highlighted up front and the interviewer was polite and respectful.
President-elect Donald Trump, left, calls out to media as they and Vice President-elect Mike Pence appear at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster clubhouse Sunday in Bedminster, N.J. | AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster De Blasio: Don't assume Trump 'just flips a switch and everything changes in this country'
Mayor Bill de Blasio has focused much of their attention since the Nov. 8 election on laying out how their administration will defy potential policies from President-elect Donald Trump. But Tuesday, one day after giving a speech outlining their plans to oppose Trump over immigration and public safety, the mayor told reporters not to expect dramatic change overnight.
"I don't think people should assume they just flips a switch and everything changes in this country,” de Blasio told reporters in lower Manhattan.
Story Continued Below
The mayor's comment came amid a flurry of questions looking for details about the city's plan to oppose potential federal policies from a Trump administration, including widespread deportation efforts and what de Blasio called "a religious registry" of Muslims.
"The president, as you know, is going to have to go through a lot of different hurdles to bring any vision to fruition, whether it's by legislation through the Congress or whether it's, in some cases, through executive order," de Blasio said. "There's going to be legal challenges; there's going to be any number of additional actions."
The mayor reiterated that it's city policy not to cooperate with federal immigration officials seeking information on undocumented residents who commit minor crimes. “We do not cooperate for minor and non-violent offenses. Nothing is going to change about that,” the mayor said.
De Blasio also dismissed the notion that Trump could wipe away large swaths of federal funding to New York City because of the mayor's opposition to specific policies. The mayor said the Supreme Court's decision in South Dakota v. Dole also “restrained the ability of the federal government to cut funding” to cities. The federal government, they said, “can tie federal funding to certain conditions, but not across the board.”
They added, “I'm not going to speculate about the funding issue, because it's way too early to tell.”
Also unclear is how much money the city will get to offset the reported $1 million-a-day price tag for protecting Trump and their eponymous midtown building, which has become the focal point for protesters, site-seers and visiting U.S. and foreign officials. De Blasio, who did not confirm the security cost, said they will talk to Trump's team early next week and ultimately expects “substantial” federal reimbursement.
The mayor — who is now campaigning for re-election ahead of next year's city races — also defended their decision to repeatedly turn their focus onto Trump and national issues. On Tuesday, the Daily News editorial page — no fan of Trump — warned the mayor, “inveighing against Trumpism is energy diverted from solving the daunting challenges New York faces.”
“There was a national election two weeks ago and it has huge ramifications for New York City and for millions of New Yorkers,” the mayor said Tuesday. “So, we have to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.”
Korean food is swiftly gaining a reputation around the world, from its exotic seafood dishes and fermented vegetables to its grilled meats and hearty stews. But for a significant number of foreign foodies, these Korean delicacies can be difficult to enjoy. Fortunately, as Korea opens up to the world, it's becoming easier for vegetarians, vegans, and others with ethical or health dietary restrictions to satisfy their appetites with Korean food, but it still takes a certain level of awareness, patience, and understanding.
One of the obstacles to maintaining an animal-friendly diet in Korea is most Koreans' lack of exposure to vegetarians and vegans, and their dietary motivations.
“It's good for the environment and good for health, in general,” says Jorge Mattheou, an American instructor at Kongju National University. “I avoid all animal products but I ate dairy for a year or two before giving it up.”
“I first became vegetarian when I was 13 -- about 20 years ago,” says Sue Tiffin, a Canadian English teacher living in Seongnam who switched to veganism in their final year of university after reading Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser. “That book opened my eyes to the importance of diet, where food comes from and the impact our food choices have on our mind and bodies. So, I guess I became a vegetarian because I became conscious of what makes my body work well and what makes my body feel sluggish, and I became vegan because once you start researching and educating yourself about any topic...you can't really turn back.”
Many westerners give up meat -- which may or may not be extended to include fish, egg, and dairy products -- for concerns like Mattheou or Tiffin's over health, compassion for animals, or the environment. Many others do it for cultural or religious reasons.
Ryan Berkebile, a practicing Buddhist living in Korea, got into vegetarianism as they explored their new religion. “Buddhism and vegetarianism came together around the same time as I investigated the meaning of human existence,” they explain. They eat dairy products and eggs, but avoids many tofu and soy products due to preservatives made from animal products. “One of the five basic precepts in Buddhism are to avoid killing. The precepts are not written-in-stone commandments; they're open to interpretation. One may interpret that as long as you don't physically kill the animal, you're not breaking the precept. From a Buddhist standpoint, food is medicine that helps us in our practice. We need sustenance in order to free ourselves from greed, delusion, and ignorance.”
Curry, mountain greens, rice, and kimchi can all be prepared without animal products.
Vegetarians and vegans like Mattheou, Tiffin, and Berkebile often have to opt out of most Korean meals. Although the Korean diet is more balanced than the typical meat-heavy diet of the west, there is no exact Korean translation of the word ”vegetarian.”
Even if a vegetarian asks for no meat, there's a chance their bibimbap will come with egg, their soup with fish, or their kimbap with ham. Even seemingly veggie-friendly delicacies such as kimchi and tofu come served with animal byproducts more often than not.
“It's generally assumed by Koreans, at least older Koreans, that meat does not include fish, ham, or even chicken sometimes, so that is a problem,” says Mattheou, who says they have gotten used to dietary misunderstandings after living in Korea for five years.
“To be honest though,” says Tiffin, “I've had similar difficulty even without the language barrier in American restaurants back home, and some of my expat friends still aren't entirely sure what I can and can't eat.”
Bean sprout soup is a staple of Buddhist temple food.
Vegetarians and vegans living in Korea have learned to survive one way or another, and have slowly made a comfortable place for themselves here.
“I think that it's important that people know that being a vegetarian/vegan in Korea is possible,” says Tiffin. “Being vegetarian in many places around the world requires patience, sometimes, but I've been able to live a regular, healthy life here with many options.”
Mattheou agrees that patience is important. They also suggest learning the language to help with ordering in restaurants. “It's still a new idea for people here,” they say, “but if you can speak the language -- even just a few phrases -- you can get by when you try to eat out.”
“I don't expect people -- expat or local -- to understand my diet,” agrees Tiffin, “but with a little patience and a little Korean language (or expert drawing skills, at first), I can usually order something that suits my diet.
Korea has been becoming much more vegetarian/vegan friendly in recent years. Recently, the Daegu Metropolitan Office of Education introduced a vegetarian lunch program at Young-jin High School, which met with success and showed a marked improvement in students' health. The program was tested under the supervision of the Daegu Green Consumer Network of Korea (DGCNK), as well as doctors from Kyungpook National University Medical College and the Department of Family Medicine from Daegu Catholic University.
“I thought my Korean doctor would have a fit when they found out I was vegan during my pregnancy, so I kept it from them for a few months,” says Tiffin. “When I told her, however, they didn't have any concerns at all. I have to look after my diet like all pregnant women should, so I just make sure that everything I eat really counts, nutrition-wise.”
Chefs at Baru Gongyang prepare a vegetarian lunch.
As more Koreans embrace the vegetarian diet, the number of vegetarian-friendly restaurants in Seoul increases. Mattheou, Tiffin, and Berkebile each have their own favorite vegetarian restaurants, largely centering on Insadong in central Seoul.
“Not only is being a vegetarian possible, you'll have some of the best vegetarian food of your life here,” says Tiffin. “Mountain bibimbap, temple food, baked goods from Alien's Day Out, vegan cheese from expats in Itaewon.”
Mattheou recommends Oh Se Gae Hyang in Insadong. “I always bring vegetarians [there] who are visiting here,” they say. “It's in the heart of Insadong, is fairly cheap, and serves vegetarian versions of traditional Korean dishes as well as Chinese and Vietnamese style food.”
“Jogyesa Temple serves free temple meals during lunch,” recommends Berkebile. “Across the street from Jogyesa, is the Templestay office; on the second floor is Baru Gongyang -- they serve traditional meals for real cheap.“
“Vegetarian or not, if you're a foodie, I strongly recommend checking out Sanchon in Insadong,” recommends Tiffin. “You'll leave feeling stuffed, satisfied and happy. Otherwise, take some patience and a sense of humor and try any restaurant -- you never know what vegan options might be available, or which options can easily be made vegetarian.”
Last April, volunteers at Animal Rescue Korea held a bake sale in Itaewon.
Another useful option for vegetarians and vegans in Korea is to prepare meals at home.
“This week I made burritos with fresh guacamole (ordered avacados online), pasta, BBQ tofu, and veggie burgers,” says Mattheou.
“I'm not a master chef or anything,” says Berkebile. “I cook a lot of rice- and vegetable-based dishes.” They order many of their ingredients through Vegefood.co.kr.
“Many expats here said I would have to survive on nothing but bibimbap and that I'd be eating meat within a month,” says Tiffin. “Many of my expat friends here lost weight because their diet was healthier than it was at home. For me, I gained weight because there's just way too much to be eaten.”
Mattheou is in the same boat. “I am hardly starving. In fact, I am a bit overweight at the moment, but otherwise in good health.”

Yesterday, Lexus said it had built a hoverboard. The company invoked the science of magnetic levitation and superconducting magnets, but left it at that. Lexus was teasing us with as little information as possible. The idea seemed plausible, though, with the one major caveat being that the person operating this superconducting skateboard would need a magnetic track to hover over, something that wasn't visible in the video.
Now, Spanish website El Patín has discovered that the the park in the ad is real, and in the pictures that it's being built in Cubelles, a village outside of Barcelona. More importantly, we can clearly see a metal track embedded in the ground of the unfinished park. The writer at El Patin says that the park's been under construction for about a month, and that it's patrolled by private security 24 hours a day. Lexus built an entire park to make its hoverboard work
The track appears to loop through the entire park and across various features. At one point it curves up into a sloped wave feature, and in one photo the track appears to go down (or up?) a set of nine stairs. As if hoverboarding wouldn't be cool enough, there are jumps.
It's unclear if Lexus plans to use the park for the sole purpose of shooting the ad campaign or if it would let non-skateboarders get a taste of the future. We've reached out to Lexus and will update this story if they respond with any more information about the hoverboard or the futuristic skatepark.

Dame Elisabeth Joy Murdoch AC, DBE (née Greene; 8 February 1909 – 5 December 2012), also known as Elisabeth, Lady Murdoch, was an Australian philanthropist and matriarch of the Murdoch family. They were the wife of Australian newspaper publisher Sir Keith Murdoch and the mother of Australian international media proprietor Rupert Murdoch. They were appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1963 for their charity work in Australia and overseas.

Family [ edit ]
Murdoch was born in Melbourne on 8 February 1909, the third daughter of Marie Grace de Lancey (Forth) and Rupert Greene. Them grandfather, William Henry Greene, was an Irish railway engineer (later one of the three Commissioners of Victorian Railways) who emigrated to Australia and married Fanny, the fourth of the 10 daughters of George Govett.[1] Them mother's ancestors were Scottish and English; one of their maternal great-grandfathers was a lieutenant governor in the West Indies.[2] Elisabeth was educated at St Catherine's School in Toorak, and at Clyde School in Woodend.[3] They married Keith Murdoch, 23 years their senior, in 1928 and inherited the bulk of their fortune when they died in 1952. Apart from Rupert, their children are Janet Calvert-Jones, Anne Kantor and Helen Handbury (1929–2004). At their death, they had 77 direct living descendants.[4]
Philanthropy [ edit ]
Murdoch devoted their life to philanthropy. Before their marriage they worked as a volunteer for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.[5] Dame Elisabeth Murdoch joined the management committee of the Royal Children's Hospital in 1933, serving as its president from 1954 to 1965. A 2003 article in the Melbourne newspaper The Age said: "Few can rival Dame Elisabeth's enormous contribution. Them interests are so many they need to be alphabetically catalogued: academia, the arts, children, flora and fauna, heritage, medical research, social welfare. Many of Melbourne and Australia's most cherished institutions, from the Royal Children's Hospital to the Australian Ballet and the Botanic Gardens, have benefited from their involvement. But Murdoch also devoted themselves to less popular causes: prisoners, children in care, those battling mental illness and substance abuse."[6]
Murdoch was a Life Governor of the Royal Women's Hospital. They were the patron of the Murdoch Children's Research Institute[7] and of the Australian American Association (Victoria), founded by their husband. They were a patron and founding member of disability organisation EW Tipping Foundation and a founding member of the Deafness Foundation of Victoria. The first woman on the council of trustees of the National Gallery of Victoria, Murdoch was a founding member of the Victorian Tapestry Workshop.[8] They were a member of the Patrons Council of the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria. Them garden, "Cruden Farm", at Langwarrin, is one of Australia's finest examples of landscape gardening and is regularly open to the public. It was originally designed by Edna Walling.[9]

Orders and medals [ edit ]
For their service as President of the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Murdoch was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Civil Division (CBE) in the 1961 Birthday Honours list.[10] For their role in building a new children's hospital in Melbourne, they were appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Civil Division (DBE) in the 1963 New Year Honours list.[11] In June 1989, they were appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia, Civil Division (AC) for services to the community[12] also receiving the Centenary Medal in 2001 for their philanthropic services to the Australian arts community.[13]
Honours [ edit ]
They also held an award from the French government for funding an exhibition of works by the French sculptor Auguste Rodin in Melbourne in 2002. They were an honorary fellow of the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects and helped to establish the Elisabeth Murdoch Chair of Landscape Architecture and the Australian Garden History Society. In 1983, Murdoch was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Laws by the University of Melbourne[14] in acknowledgement of their contributions to research, the arts and philanthropy. Trinity College, Melbourne installed them as a Fellow in 2000.[15] In 2001, Treloars gave their name to a new rose introduction.[16] Following extensive donations to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne, a Tasmanian species of Boronia (B. elisabethiae) was named after her.[3] In 2003, Murdoch was admitted into life membership of Philanthropy Australia, and awarded the key to the City of Melbourne, in an official ceremony at the Town Hall.[6] In 2004, a high school, Langwarrin Secondary College, was renamed Elisabeth Murdoch College to honour their work in the local community. In 2009, the main performance venue of the Melbourne Recital Centre was named in their honour.[17] In 2010, Geelong Grammar School completed a new girls' boarding house named in their honour.[18]
Murdoch's charity work earned them the Victorian of the Year award in 2005 at age 96.[19] In January 2007, aged 97 years and 11 months, they surpassed Dame Alice Chisholm as Australia's longest-lived dame.[20]
Patronage [ edit ]
Murdoch was a patron of the Australian Family Association.[21]
Death [ edit ]
On 5 December 2012, Murdoch died in their sleep in Melbourne, Victoria at the age of 103.[22][23]
Paris last weekend was a hive of activity, with more than one current driver paying a visit to Motorsport.com to see what might be the latest movement in the driver market.
As one team boss remarked: "You can tell the silly season has officially opened because Julian [Jakobi, manager to Jean-Eric Vergne and Sebastien Buemi] is in the paddock!"
The questions were bouncing off the tight paddock walls that partitioned the Avenue des Invalides: Just how many offers has Antonio Felix da Costa had? Were Jaguar testing the week after Paris? Who was the British driver yet to race in Formula E that had multiple offers?
When would the Andretti-BMW deal become public? Has DS Virgin already made up its mind to replace Vergne? Were Neel Jani and Pipo Derani really there just as tourists? Which other team was Magneti Marelli supplying in season three?
Inevitably, there were more questions than answers.
The biggest surprise, however, came when Motorsport.com chatted to Audi-contracted Lucas di Grassi on Friday afternoon and the championship leader was open in their fluid plans for next season.
It will perplex many to imagine di Grassi racing for anyone other than ABT in Formula E next season. But the Brazilian has been arguably the most consistent performer in the series so far and is a man in high demand.
Also, as brutal as it sounds, they could end the season being denied another title because of a mistake by their team. So, in the hard-nosed world of international motorsport should we really be surprised that they are weighing up their options?
After the Mexican disqualification, di Grassi was publically cool and professional, but privately they seethed after seeing another 25-point haul disappear.
With Sebastien Buemi and the Renault e.dams team having thrown away their own big points at both Buenos Aires and Long Beach, di Grassi had to make hay in order to negate the clear performance advantage that the Renault enjoys at most circuits.
Late-night events in Mexico could, like Berlin last season, therefore come to be one of the defining moments of the season two campaign.
Of course, the ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport squad and di Grassi laid to rest at least a part of the Mexico City nightmare by fighting back supremely at Long Beach, and made it back-to-back wins with last weekend's Paris triumph to pull 11 points clear of Buemi in the title chase.
The ABT team is among the best in the championship, and has proved it on many occasions. So, what to make of di Grassi's comments? A thinly veiled reminder to their team, or merely a call to arms for a rival to get them on board?
The silly season in Formula E is in full swing. It was Felix da Costa who had previously appeared to be the lynchpin in the driver market, with multiple offers coming in to secure the Portuguese driver's services for the 2016/17 season.
But now, with di Grassi's looking at alternative potential programmes, the musical chairs could be set for an even more frenetic shuffling.
Benjamin Franklin was a pretty amazing guy. The quintessential Renaissance Man, they were a scientist, inventor, author, musician, scholar, businessman and politician. There are many popular stories and quotes from Franklin's life, but one in particular demonstrates their astute understanding of human behavior. In fact, this story became so well-known that it eventually led to what is now a well-known psychological phenomenon, aptly called, The Benjamin Franklin Effect.
The Story: Franklin first entered politics when they ran for and won election to the position of clerk of the state's general assembly. During their first term, like all politicians, Franklin made both a lot of friends and a few enemies. At the end of their term, one of those adversaries threatened Franklin's political career when they stood before the state legislature and delivered a long and scathing speech in opposition to Franklin's reelection. Although Franklin still won the election, they realized that the gentleman in question, as someone of substantial influence, would be better to have as a friend than as an enemy. So, Franklin set about to change their adversary's opinion. They sent a letter to the man asking for a favor – the loan of a rare and highly sought after book that the man was known to have in their personal library. Flattered, Franklin's detractor immediately sent the book, along with a polite note, in response. Franklin read the book and returned it a week later with a note of thanks. According to Franklin's autobiography, the next time the legislature met, the man immediately approached and spoke cordially to Franklin. They discussed the book and several other common interests. Franklin related that their former enemy and they eventually became close friends, a friendship that continued until the man's death. To quote from Franklin's autobiography “”He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than they whom you yourself have obliged.”
The Ben Franklin Effect: Doing something nice for someone makes you like them more: Typically, we think that we do nice things for the people we like and we do less nice things to the people that we dislike. Similarly, we think that doing something nice for someone (i.e. loaning them a book), makes them like us better, not the opposite. However, it appears that, at least some of the time, the opposite is actually true. We come to like people who we do nice things for, and equally, we come to dislike those who we treat poorly.
How the BF Effect works: Current self-perception theory tells us that our brains behave like an outside observer, continually watching what we do and then contriving explanations for those actions, which subsequently influence our beliefs about ourselves. I know. Weird. Sounds backwards, doesn't it? But, according to current research, this is the actual sequence for many of the things that we believe to be true about ourselves.
Our observing brain doesn't like it when our actions don't match the beliefs we have about ourselves, a situation commonly referred to as cognitive dissonance. So, whenever your behavior is in conflict with your beliefs (for example if you do a favor for someone you may not like very much or vice versa, when you do something bad to someone you are supposed to care about), this conflict immediately sets off alarm bells in your brain. The brain has a clever response – it goes about changing how you feel in order to reduce the conflict and turn off the alarms. So, if you believe that you don't like someone, but then you help them or do something nice for them, your brain simply changes how you think about that person. You start to think “Gee, this guy is pretty cool; I actually do like them after all“. Similarly, if you have been snarky toward someone you care about, your brain convinces you that the person must have deserved the poor treatment and……here is the really yucky part……you start to find fault with the person and like them less. A horrific and extreme example of this form of cognitive dissonance and its resolution is the way in which initially unwilling Nazi soldiers came to dehumanize and hate their Jewish victims.
The research: There are many studies of cognitive dissonance and several specifically that examine the Benjamin Franklin Effect. One of the first experiments invited volunteers to participate in a psychology experiment in which they would have the chance to win money (1). An actor pretending to be a scientist attempted to make the subjects dislike them by being rude and demanding as they administered a rigged series of tests to them. The subjects were successful in the tests regardless of how they answered and so all were awarded the promised money. At the end of the session, the fake scientist stopped one-third of all the subjects as they were leaving and asked them to return the money. They told them they were paying for the experiment out of their own pocket and the study was in danger of losing its funding. All agreed to return the money (i.e. they did the meanster a favor). Another third left the room and a secretary (who they had not met before) asked if they would please donate their winnings back into the research department fund, providing the same reason. Again, everyone agreed. The final third simply left with their winnings. (Note: Remember The Steve Series: In this study design, the secretary group was a positive control and the group that kept their money was the negative control group).
The Results: The study objective, hidden from the participants, was to measure the volunteer's attitudes about the unpleasant scientist in the three different scenarios. All of the participants completed a questionnaire at the end of the day that asked them to rate the likeability of the scientist. True to the BF Effect, those participants who had done the scientist the favor directly rated them as significantly more likeable than either those who were asked by the secretary or those who left with their money. Even though they were treated very rudely, doing something nice for the obnoxious scientist caused people to think of them more positively.
At this point, you may be asking, “What does any of this have to do with dogs“?
Well, a lot, perhaps. Here's another study for you to ponder: In a study conducted at the University of North Carolina, participants were asked to teach a group of students to repeat a tapping pattern that they read from a set of instructions (2). They worked with each student individually and were instructed to use one of two teaching methods which were randomly assigned to each of their students. In one method, the teacher offered encouragement and praise when the learner repeated the tapping pattern correctly. In the second method, the teacher criticized and insulted the learner whenever they made mistakes. (Hmmm…..sound familiar trainers?). Afterward, the study participants who acted as teachers completed a questionnaire that included questions about how likable they found each of their students to be. Here are the results:
The study participants rated the students who they had praised and encouraged as highly attractive, friendly, pleasant and likable.
By comparison, they rated the students who they had insulted and berated as particularly unlikable and unattractive.
The researchers concluded that the volunteer teachers' treatment of each student created their perception of that student. They liked the students who they were required to be kind to and they disliked the students who they were required to punish.
The Benjamin Franklin Effect works in both directions – kind behaviors create positive perceptions while hurtful behaviors lead to unfavorable perceptions.
Take Away for Dog Folks: Reading about the BF effect lead me to think about dogs and training (well okay, it is true that pretty much everything leads me to think about dogs). In this particular case, the Ben Franklin effect caused me to think more about the human side of the relationship rather than about the dogs themselves. Trainers who promote methods that emphasize positive reinforcement typically focus on the effects that these methods have upon the dogs. There is a general consensus that dogs who are trained with primarily positive reinforcement (+R) tend to be less stressed, are more willing and motivated to learn, and enjoy learning to a greater degree than dogs trained using negative reinforcement-based methods (-R).
However, we don't always consider the effects that these two approaches may have upon the trainer. The Ben Franklin Effect suggests that how we treat our dogs during training influences how we think about them as individuals – specifically, how much we like (or dislike) them. When we do nice things for our dogs in the form of treats, praise, petting and play to reinforce desired behaviors, such treatment may result in our liking them more. And, if we use harsh words, collar jerks or hitting in an attempt to change our dog's behavior, then, well, if good ol' Ben is correct, we will start to like our dog less. If the Ben Franklin Effect is correct, we are heavily (and unconsciously) inclined to like the dogs who we treat well (use +R) and to dislike the dogs who we, well treat poorly (-R).
Think about it. When you see someone yelling at their dog…….does that person really appear to like that dog? Is cognitive dissonance (and the BF effect) leading them to conclude that their dog must be bad, poorly behaved, dumb, unlikable, unattractive, since they are deserving of such correction? Similarly, does the regular use of positive reinforcement, telling our dogs “Yippee, you did it!! You are SO smart and so very good!” subconsciously also encourage us to love them more?
My bet is that it does, but of course this needs to be studied scientifically……..behavior graduate students – interested?
Be nice. Be kind. Do favors. Ben says you will love your dog more for it.

Obama Ramps Up War Pitch Even As Basic Arguments Fall by the Wayside
Obama is going on a whirlwind media blitz this week in an attempt to sell a very skeptical public on war with Syria.
Yet the Washington Post notes:
Obama's top aide says the administration lacks “irrefutable, beyond-a-reasonable-doubt evidence” that skeptical Americans, including lawmakers who will start voting on military action this week, are seeking.
Indeed, those who have seen the evidence say that it is incredibly weak. German intelligence also says that Assad didn't order the attacks.
Moreover, President Obama correctly noted in 2007:
The President does not have the power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.
Yet Obama admitted last week:
Some people had noted, and I think this is true, that had I been in the Senate in the midst of this period, I probably would have suggested to a Democratic or a Republican president that Congress should have the ability to weigh in an issue like this, that is not immediate, imminent, time-sensitive. *** We may not be directly, imminently threatened by what's taking place in … Syria … in the short term, but our long-term national security will be impacted in a profound way, and our humanity is impacted in a profound way.
No wonder that Obama has lost some of their biggest initial supporters for a strike against Syria.
Reuters notes:
Fresh from signing Ben Betts from Munster, Leicester Tigers appear to be on the verge of capturing Mick McGrath from Leinster.
The 25 year old winger was released by the Irish province at the end of last season and has subsequently been offered a trial with the Tigers.
After making seven appearances for the blues over the course of two seasons, McGrath looks to be about to try their hand in the Aviva Premiership.
However, there is currently huge competition for places at Leicester following the arrival of JP Pietersen this summer, who joins the likes of Peter Betham and Telusa Veainu as options out wide.
Yet if McGrath can impress while on trial, the 25 year old could follow in the footsteps of Geordan and Johne Murphy and use the move to further their professional career.
McGrath previously played in England with Plymouth Albion before being persuaded to join Clontarf by Bernard Jackman. Having impressed with ‘Tarf' in the AIL, the winger earned a Leinster contract in 2014, before being let go this summer.
Fox News Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano claimed “three intelligence sources” say President Obama looked to British spy agency GCHQ to obtain transcripts of conversations involving President Donald Trump on “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday.
Napolitano said, “[T]hree intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command. They didn't use the NSA. They didn't use the CIA. They didn't use the FBI, and they didn't use Department of Justice. They used GCHQ. What the heck is GCHQ? That's the initials for the British spying agency. They have 24/7 access to the NSA database. So by simply having two people go to them saying, ‘President Obama needs transcripts of conversations involving candidate Trump, conversations involving president-elect Trump,' he's able to get it, and there's no American fingerprints on this.”

Linda Carroll (born April 7, 1944)[2] is an American author and a marriage counselor and family therapist.[3] Carroll received national attention in 1993 when one of their patients, the fugitive Katherine Ann Power, turned themselves in to authorities after spending twenty-three years eluding police.[4] Carroll is best known professionally as a couple's therapist,[5] and as an author of three books, the latest being Love Cycles: The Five Essential Stages of Lasting Love, in 2014.[6]
They have worked as a couple's therapist for more than 30 years. In addition to being a licensed psychotherapist, they are certified in Imago Therapy,[7] the couple's therapy developed by Dr. Harville Hendrix and Dr. Helen LaKelly Hunt.  They are also a master teacher in the Pairs Psychoeducation Process, a nationally recognized relationship education program for couples. Carroll studied Voice Dialogue with Drs. Hal and Sidra Stone, Holotropic Breathwork with Dr. Stanislav Grof, the Four-Fold with Angeles Arrien, the Diamond Heart Work of A.H. Almaas, and trained with The Couples Institute of Drs. Ellyn Bader and Peter Pearson.  They are also certified in the Hot Monogamy program, which helps couples create or re-create a passionate connection between them.
They teach workshops and delivers keynote addresses throughout the United States and is a frequent speaker at Rancho La Puerta in Tecate, Baja California, Mexico.[8]
Born and raised in San Francisco, Linda Carroll now lives in Corvallis, Oregon, with their veterinarian husband, Tim Barraud.  They are the mother of singer and musician Courtney Love, and the daughter of novelist Paula Fox.
Biography [ edit ]
Linda was born to Paula Fox when Fox was 20,[9] the result of a short-lived relationship.[10] Paula lived under the roof of acting coach Stella Adler at the time, as did then unknown actor Marlon Brando.[11] There have been persistent rumors that Brando fathered the child,[12] although neither Brando nor Fox ever commented on the matter.[13][14] Linda Carroll did not meet their birth mother until later in life.[15] Given the tumultuous relationship with Paula's own biological parents, they gave the child up for adoption. Linda was adopted into a Catholic family of part Italian descent, and was raised in Pacific Heights by Jack and Louella Risi. Linda took their surname after their friend Judy Carroll, after Judy's death.[9] Linda graduated from high school in 1961.
They married writer and one-time Grateful Dead manager Hank Harrison in 1963 in Reno, Nevada[9] and gave birth to a daughter, Courtney Michelle Harrison on July 9, 1964. Within years of Courtney's birth, both Carroll's adoptive parents died.[15][16] They divorced Harrison after eighteen months of marriage, alleging that they had given them the drug LSD, and brought their daughter Courtney with them to Marcola, Oregon. They had two other daughters, Nicole and Jaimee, with their second husband, Frank Rodríguez.[15][17]
After finishing their bachelor's degree in Oregon in the 1970s, they moved to New Zealand. They returned to Oregon in the 1980s, received a masters in counseling, and began practicing as a therapist. Carroll and their veterinarian husband, Tim Barraud, began to teach a couples course based on the Imago work of Harville Hendrix, the PAIRS training of Dr. Lori Gordon, and their own insights, study, and practices.
As an adult, Carroll found that their birth mother is the novelist Paula Fox (her grandmother was screenwriter Elsie Fox).[16] In 2006, their memoir Them Mother's Daughter: A Memoir of the Mother I Never Knew and of My Daughter, Courtney Love, was published by Doubleday.[18] Love's agent called the book a work of "vicious and greedy fiction", and said, "We find it astonishing that any mother should write such a book. This is especially true in the case of Ms Carroll, who abandoned their daughter when they were a seven-year-old and whom Ms Love thus barely knows at all."[9][16] Linda Carroll, however, contends in their memoir that they left Courtney with a friend for just two months at age nine while they were looking for a home in New Zealand and that Courtney remained with them until they emancipated themselves at age 16.[15] Linda Carroll has not spoken to their daughter in years and remains estranged.
"Far from a celebrity memoir, Them Mother's Daughter," Booklist, the review journal of the American Library Association wrote, "Despite the suggestive subtitle, Carroll's memoir is far less tell-all than it is their personal recollections of growing up feeling alienated from their adoptive family, their peers, and their religion. ... A thoughtful memoir of one woman's coming-of-age in the turbulent 1960s and 1970s."[19]
As of 2015, Carroll has five children and ten grandchildren.[20]

The president addressed the gun right's body's conference in Atlanta, reliving their election triumph but also admitting that their border wall will not be continuous
Donald Trump marked their 99th day as US president by basking in the noisy adulation of their base and making a pledge to the National Rifle Association: “You came through for me and I am going to come through for you.”
The caustic spectacle that powered Trump to victory in last year's election was on full display before they took the stage in Atlanta, with big-screen ads denouncing their defeated opponent Hillary Clinton, loud boos for former president Barack Obama and speaker after speaker railing against media and Hollywood elites.
How NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre became Trump's left-hand man Read more
By comparison, the president themselves was restrained and even made a concession on their signature policy of building a wall on the Mexican border. “It's a wall in certain areas – obviously we have these massive physical structures you don't need and we have certain big rivers – but we need a wall and we're going to get that wall,” they said. It was the first time they had conceded that the wall would not run continuously along the border.
Trump is more at ease in the company of the faithful – extolling guns, religion and nationhood, suspicious of elites, airing a sense of grievance – than among the suits, concrete and baroque marble of Washington. They will spend their 100th day in office at a campaign-style rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: such raucous events appear to give them a shot in the arm after bureaucratic wrangling with politicians.
“I see all those beautiful red and white hats but we will never forget our favourite slogan of them all: make America great again,” they said on Friday after yet again recounting their election night success.
The NRA was one of their most loyal allies during the 2016 contest. Even as other conservatives balked at Trump's record, wary of their past support for Democrats and personal scandals, the NRA spent at least $30m, more than any other outside group, to put them in the White House. On Friday they noted that they were the first sitting president to address the NRA at its annual meeting since Ronald Reagan in 1983.
Trump entered to a standing ovation, chants of “USA! USA!” and strains of Hail to the Chief. They struck a more moderate tone than on the campaign trail but could not resist throwing some red meat to an audience of about 10,000 people. They described Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren, a potential opponent in the 2020 election, as “Pocahontas”, a reference to claims they made about being part Native American. The insult was widely seen as racist when Trump used it during the campaign.
The president has been supportive of NRA efforts to weaken restrictions on ownership and promised to scrap Obama's efforts to strengthen background checks. In a speech thin on legislative achievements but thick on mutual congratulation, they declared: “The eight-year assault on your second amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end. You have a true friend and champion in the White House. No longer will federal agencies be coming after law-abiding gun owners. No longer will the government be trying to undermine your rights and your freedoms as Americans.”
They pledged to defend responsible gun ownership and “protect our wonderful hunters and their access to the very beautiful lands” – they made reference to their adult sons' love of the outdoors – as well “the sacred right of self-defence” for all citizens.
They ran through a list of their appointments since becoming president on 20 January including Neil Gorsuch, expected to maintain a narrow gun rights majority on the supreme court, and Jeff Sessions as attorney general, already pushing a hardline law-and-order agenda. “Our police and sheriffs also know that when you ban guns, only the criminals will be armed,” they said. “For too long Washington has gone after law-abiding gun owners while making life easier for criminals … We are protecting the freedoms of law-abiding Americans and we are going after the drug gangs and criminal cartels that prey on innocent citizens.”
Trump claimed that, under the homeland security secretary, John Kelly, there had been a 73% decrease in illegal immigration on the southern border; similar assertions in the past have been challenged by fact checkers. Trump claimed they were a victim of their own success and critics were seeking to use this decline to argue against the need for a border wall.
Promising to defend the second amendment, Trump added: “We can't be complacent. These are dangerous times, these are horrible times for certain obvious reasons, but we are going to make them great times again.”
Before Trump spoke, the crowd was fired up by patriotic country music and a triumphalist film montage on big screens that showed clips of George Clooney, Tom Hanks, Barack Obama, Stephen Colbert, Rosie O'Donnell, Nancy Pelosi and others confidently predicting Trump's defeat intercut with news coverage of their shock win. The crowd erupted in loud boos for Obama.
Lt Col Oliver North offered an invocation. Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, said: “President Trump's had a hell of a first 100 days.” They added: “We now have a commander-in-chief who isn't afraid to bomb the ever-loving hell out of Isis.”
On election day, they said, NRA members stormed to the polls in an “act of defiance”. The media even attacked them over the size of their inauguration crowd, Cox said. “I told them the only number that mattered was how many people watched Hillary Clinton's inauguration: zero.”
Wayne LaPierre, executive vice-president and CEO of the NRA, taunted the academic, political and media elites that they said posed “America's greatest domestic threats”. They demanded: “When did the media stop being journalists and start becoming PR flaks for the destruction of our country? … Truth is no longer a fundamental principle. It's now just a political device.”
The NRA has fought back, LaPierre said, by kicking politicians into obscurity, educating citizens about the second amendment and “by giving the media the big fat black eye it so often richly deserves”.
Recycled election commercials attacked Clinton over their handling of the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, when they were secretary of state. The audience jeered Clinton's image but cheered when the ad ended with the NRA symbol and the words “No more lies. Defeat Hillary.” During the election campaign, Trump falsely suggested Clinton wanted to abolish the second amendment.
Guns are allowed in most public places in Georgia, including the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta where the NRA meeting is taking place, but attendees were not allowed to bring firearms to the leadership forum where Trump spoke. They were provided with free lockers to store their guns instead.

Scott Atchison, 53, wearing a red “make America great again” baseball cap, said: “I voted for Donald Trump because they were the only one talking about the major issues that affect this country: immigration, the corrupt government. Between them and Hillary, there was no choice.”
Atchison, from Decatur, Alabama, who owns 30 guns, is satisfied with Trump's first 100 days and would vote for them again. “He's doing well for what they can accomplish on their own but he's fighting against the globalists, Congress and establishment bureaucracy.”
The high point so far, they said, was attorney general Jeff Sessions' crackdown on border security and immigration. “If it's true that he's not seeking funding for the border wall, that's the low point because that's the reason everyone voted for him.”
Michael Temple, 46, a marketing consultant from Toledo, Ohio, said: “I voted for them because I hated Hillary Clinton and I liked their position on some issues. I liked the way the NRA supported him. I think he's done OK so far. I want to see more legislation get passed. The highlight was their executive order on immigration, even though it got all shot to hell.”
The annual meeting includes a trade show, stores and an airgun range bedecked with stars and stripes and next to a sign with a picture of a squirrel that says: “Protect your nuts.” An on-site shop is selling “NRA country” bags, coasters, flasks, hats, mugs and T-shirts as well as barbecue lighters resembling AR-15 rifles.
Democratic member of congress John Lewis, a civil rights leader from Atlanta, had pledged to join gun control activists in Atlanta to protest against what they called “the NRA's dangerous ‘guns everywhere' agenda”, which activists blame for contributing to America's toll of gun suicide and murder that claims an estimated 90 lives each day. About two-thirds of America's 30,000 gun deaths each year are gun suicides.
There were low-key protests in downtown Atlanta on Friday as people carried signs supporting background checks for gun sales and condemning NRA political donations as blood money. Demonstrators held a “die-in”, lying down on the park's lawn to symbolise victims of gun violence before marching towards the convention centre.
( Check out Deconstructing the Syrian War, my new e-book on the Syrian war, the most consequential war of recent times)
The idea of US and its allies supporting ISIS is shocking to most people and creates a lot of painful cognitive dissonance. The immediate reactions might be, “Impossible” … “Conspiracy Theory!” However, all the evidences are incontrovertible and have been laid out before us. It's just a matter of piecing them together.
You see, to overthrow Assad in Syria, the US elites couldn't openly arm Al Qaeda and ISIS. That's where Saudi Arabia and Qatar come into play. These two countries would buy the weapons from the U.S. and ship them to the terrorists in Syria mostly via Turkey and some through Jordan (Turkey borders Syria on the north; Jordan on the south).
All the top people in the U.S. government knew and acknowledged the roles of Saudi Arabia and Qatar in funding ISIS. For example…
Isn't it strange that the U.S. would do nothing about the countries that fund and arm ISIS? No outrage, no condemnation, no sanctions and no wars. In fact, these countries that support ISIS are our best buddies!
Look Who Sees ISIS as an Ally!
Even more bizarrely, both the U.S. and Israel have admitted that they view ISIS positively since it was/is helping them in the regime change plot against Assad. Not to mention that Israel's relationship with ISIS is beyond suspicious.
But We Are Arming “Moderate Rebels”!!!
The biggest cover for the 6-year attack on Syria was that we were supporting “freedom-loving” rebels. Nothing could be farther from the truth. It was obvious that:
A. The so-called “Free Syrian Army” of “moderate rebels” are often just as fundamentalist as the Taliban or other Salafists; they are just as ruthless and violent as ISIS.
B. The moderate rebels mingled and cooperated with both Al Qaeda and ISIS, as extensively reported even by the mainstream media.
Please read my article “The Myth of Moderate Rebels” for more details.
However, on the pretext of imaginary “moderate rebels,” billions of dollars of weapons and tens of thousands of terrorists were sent into Syria. Even the lying mainstream media have published hundreds of detailed articles on the shipment of weapons and flow of money from the Gulf States to Al Qaeda and ISIS in Syria.
So those are quite convincing evidences of US and its allies funding, arming, training and supporting ISIS in Syria.
(BTW, why would the U.S. support Al Qaeda and ISIS and so desperately want to overthrow Assad? Because oil/gas, pipelines and religion (Sunni-Shiite conflict). You can read my article “Three Motives and Seven Countries Behind the War in Syria“)
Now let's look at other circumstantial evidences that would lead us to the same conclusion.
Connecting the dots … Circumstantial Evidence for Helping ISIS
If you carefully look at the birth of ISIS, how they acquired weapons and money, traded oil, used satellite TV and social media, and became so powerful … it's obvious they got a lot of help from the globalists.
Suspicious Birth of ISIS
To start from the beginning, the top leaders of Al Qaeda in Iraq – which was first known as Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) and then morphed into ISIS – had spent time in CIA prisons. One guy – Baghdadi – went on to lead ISIS; the second guy – Julani – became the leader of Al Qaeda (Al Nusra) in Syria. It's just like Libya, when Abdul Belhaj left the CIA prison to lead the war against Gaddafi.
Also, many foreign commanders who later joined ISIS had links to the CIA – for example, ISIS commander Omar Shishani, who the media proudly said was a “star pupil” of the CIA in Georgia (the country).
Unhindered Growth of ISIS
With all the surveillance abilities of NSA and CIA, it's hard to believe that they have no idea where the top leaders of ISIS and Al Qaeda are. It wouldn't be surprising if these terrorists are living in a luxurious mansion in one of the Gulf States, monitoring their global jihad campaigns.
The entire story of ISIS was so ridiculous from the beginning. A bunch of terrorists with just simple guns somehow managed to take over big cities in Iraq. At the same time, they also never attacked Baghdad – a sign of “controlled chaos.” They got hold of a huge arsenal of weapons – tanks, mortars, rockets etc. without much fight. ISIS also immediately knew how to operate those hi-tech weapons – a sign of US training. Later, ISIS was moving around the vast desert in 1000's of brand-new Toyota pickup trucks and US-made tanks totally unhindered. Using Iraqi air force or the vast US air force in Saudi military bases, ISIS could have been easily wiped out at the time.
Oops, ISIS Got Our Weapons
When a report from Amnesty International pointed out in 2015 that most of ISIS' weapons were American, media pundits just came up all kinds of excuses and explanations.
Then there were those moments when, oops, the U.S. accidentally dropped weapons in ISIS-held areas. Come on!
How about when audits done by the US Department of Defense reveal that over $2.5 billion worth of weapons/vehicles sent to Iraq and Kuwait in 2015/2016 cannot be accounted for?
Or, how about the time when CNN showed a video of ISIS training camp that had tents marked “US”?
For three years, Turkey was selling US-made weapons to ISIS in exchange for stolen oil. This went on until Putin came in and destroyed ISIS' oil tankers – easy targets for jets. When asked why the US hadn't done the same, Mike Morell, former CIA chief and supporter of Hillary Clinton, said the U.S. was afraid of environmental damage! The insanity of such lies is beyond incredible.
Fake Attacks on ISIS and Real Attacks on the Syrian Military
Obama kept dropping thousands of bombs in Syria/Iraq – 50,000 bombs in 2015 and 2016 alone – but ISIS kept growing. If each bomb had killed just one ISIS soldier, there wouldn't be any ISIS left. It was obvious Obama was waging a fake war.
More than a few times, the U.S. or Israeli air force attacked the Syrian army that always ended up helping ISIS or Al Qaeda in crucial battles (link, link).
Media and Pundits Rooted For ISIS and Al Qaeda
ISIS is what is known as “Psy Ops” in the military.
It was quite obvious that ISIS' propaganda machine was driven by Americans/Israelis with Hollywood and Public Relations experience. ISIS' vast presence in social media – Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and more – in multiple languages, incredibly creative (but sick) videos and messaging that appealed to westerners, and the use of satellite TV to broadcast gruesome propaganda were all clear indications of vast support from western intelligence agencies. (Think about how Facebook, Twitter and YouTube block or delete accounts for saying anything mildly politically incorrect.)
As an example of media collusion and blatant Establishment propaganda, consider the Saudi cleric Abdullah Muhaisini (also Mhaisni/Muhaysni) in Syria who the L.A. Times describes as a “superstar” while BBC prefers “charismatic.” They have Twitter accounts with 300,000+ followers and is popular on YouTube/Telegram as well. The shocking part is that they are a terrorist in Syria who openly assists ISIS/Al Qaeda, recruits young kids for suicide bombing and proudly participates in mass executions.
When ISIS was defeated and it's capital, Mosul, was liberated in July 2017, the titles in mainstream media spoke volumes. Nobody celebrated it; it was bemoaned as “Fall” of Mosul. And the discussion wasn't how Iraq can recuperate or how Iraq can avoid groups such as ISIS in the future. Instead, the analyses were how ISIS can come back! The ultra-liberal New Yorker screamed, “Mosul Falls. What's Next For ISIS?” The conservative Wall Street Journal pondered somberly, “What would the fall of Mosul mean to ISIS?”
Finally, if Assad kills people in Syria, the west sheds crocodile tears, acts so shocked and starts debating air strikes. However, when ISIS kills people in Europe, politicians and the media tell us to get used to it.
Why? What's the Big Picture?
Islamic terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda, ISIS, Al Shabaab (Somalia), Abu Sayyaf (Philippines), Boko Haram (Nigeria) are all useful tools for the globalists. Islamic terrorism is a source of cheap warriors who will fight fiercely and die gladly. There are also plenty of them and can be summoned from around the world, thus serving as mercenaries for endless wars, which is wonderful for the military-industrial complex and the puppet masters who dream of global hegemony. Also, proxy wars can be started without having to go through political debates or get Congressional/public approvals. Yes, a few countries will be destroyed, there will be blowback, there will be mass immigration of Muslims to Europe and the U.S., there will be social chaos … but it's all worth it. This is the inconvenient truth and you can read about it in my article on the unholy alliance between the globalists and Islamic terrorists.

On Monday, the US Supreme Court made a landmark ruling that represented a major victory for pro-choice activists. In a 5–3 decision, the justices struck down a Texas law that imposed strict new rules on clinics and doctors that performed abortions—rules that forced many clinics to close and made it much more difficult for many women in the state to access safe abortions.
Those restrictions, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in the majority opinion, created an "undue burden on abortion access." And the ramifications of Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt will be felt far beyond the Lone Star State.
Basically, Hellerstedt pushes back on the last major Supreme Court case to tackle abortion: 1992's Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Back then, the court decided that states could place restrictions on abortion access, provided they didn't result in an "undue burden" on women. Conservative legislators then began to test those waters, passing laws mandating waiting periods and ultrasounds. In Texas's case, the new law required abortion clinics to meet the same standards as hospitals and forced abortion doctors to gain admitting privileges to nearby hospitals. Those onerous demands had an immediate effect: When the law passed in 2013, there were about 40 places one could get an abortion in Texas; today there are about 20.
The Hellerstedt decision held that that was taking things too far, and it marks the first time the Supreme Court has defined what an "undue burden" looks like—basically, it's a signal to lawmakers that they can't simply make up whatever rules they like in the name of limiting abortions.
To get a sense of what this would mean for both sides of the never-ending legal and political battle over abortions, I called up Carol Sanger, a professor at Columbia Law School and an expert in reproductive rights.
VICE: Were you surprised by this decision?
Carol Sanger: Well I was very hopeful about it. I'm not sure I'm surprised. But I thought the points were grasped so well and I thought [Breyer's decision] was so thorough. And for the people who didn't really get the points, Justice [Ruth Bader] Ginsberg really banged out a page-and-a-half decision just highlighting it. It was like the CliffNotes version.
People are hailing this as the most important decision about abortion in more than 20 years. Is that hyperbole?
It's certainly not hyperbolic. There have been three big decisions in abortion jurisprudence. The first is Roe v. Wade, which [ruled] that abortion falls within a constitutional right of privacy and that women have the right to choose it. The second one is Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which was in 1992—people were putting money on it overturning Roe. It said that [the Supreme Court doesn't] overturn cases lightly, and that people have gotten used to [abortion] as a liberty that they have, and that an entire generation has come to rely on that right.
That was the good part of the decision. The bad part was everything else that followed, because they changed the ruling of Roe significantly. Roe had said that in the first trimester, it's just up to the woman and their doctor, and no one can butt in. And Casey said, "We're getting rid of those trimesters and the state can try to persuade women against abortion from the moment of conception." So that was a very big change, and it was a signal to the states that they could pass more aggressive laws persuading women against abortion, and that's when this sort of avalanche of legislation came in––waiting periods, for example. Telling people they should come back [to the clinic] in 48 hours so they can think harder.
So Casey was really important, because while it upheld Roe's essential core, it made it possible to regulate abortion like crazy. And that's what states that wanted to do that did.
What is the "undue burden" standard set up by Casey?
That means that if a state enacts a law with the purpose or effect of putting a substantial obstacle in front of a woman seeking an abortion, then that has gone too far. That has denied them the right that they got in Roe. In Casey, Pennsylvania had passed a bunch of restrictions, and the only one that they found went too far was women requiring women to notify their husbands that they were getting abortions before they did. The court had read about domestic violence in American families and thought that angry husbands might prevent them from actually getting the abortion by either emotional threat or by locking them up.
So this case comes up in Texas, and the plaintiff said it's gone too far. If this legislation doesn't have the purpose of the effect of putting a substantial obstacle in front of women, what does? And the court said that it does.
It seems bizarre that the lower courts couldn't predict this was going to effectively shutter so many abortion clinics in Texas––it ended up closing 50 percent of them.
Well Texas made a big fuss about it. It's an interesting part of the decision––they had said that they thought the clinics could handle all this business. There's really a terrific line in the decision where the court says, "More fundamentally, in the face of no threat to women's health, Texas seeks to force women to travel long distances to get abortions in crammed-to-capacity superfacilities." Crammed is not a really nice word. And in the sentence after it, it says that doctors won't be able to spend [as much] time with their patients.
It's really ironic, because the pro-life movement says, "Doctors are just running abortion mills. They just want your money." But here, the Texas law itself, according to the state of Texas, is gonna create abortion mills––"crammed" facilities where you don't get enough time with your doctor. That's very ironic to me.
But that sentence also says it's for no medical benefit that women will have to travel long distances. So that sentence sort of encapsulates what the burden is on women. And it's not like it says, "to save their lives, women will have to do X, Y, and Z." They don't get anything out of it. And it was made clear beyond opposition in the district court that abortion is a safe procedure. And the court says, in fact, childbirth is 14 times more risky.
And you can have a midwife come to your house.
Exactly. So, do you need an ambulatory facility at your house? No.
Are there going to be a lot more legal challenges to laws that resemble the Texas law in the wake of this decision?
Many cases will now be brought in states where they haven't been, or where they've lost, in light of this decision. And that doesn't mean that all of those regulations [will be] struck down like in Texas.
Even though the Texas law was stuck down, it still resulted in a lot of clinics closing, and the Supreme Court can't immediately reopen them by fiat. Even with this precedent, couldn't a state legislator just pass a very restrictive law with the knowledge that it would be very hard to get an abortion in their or their state for at least a few years?
Well, they have been doing that. They've sort of been passing things as a taunt––that's sort of a way to think about it. Like, "Tell us we can't do that, go ahead." Lately, the courts have gone so far by driving, in the case of Mississippi, all of the clinics out of the state. Some legislators are completely brazen about this, and say things like, "Well this ought to cut abortion down to size." They're completely transparent about what their purpose is.
So what's the next big fight after Monday's decision?
This one really only dealt with requirements on the provider or the facility, and what we haven't dealt with is requirements on women. The court said that when they're deciding what the facts are and what the burdens are, they're gonna look at actual data. They don't have to rely wholly on what the legislature says. If you look at the Texas legislation, they have lines like, "in order to protect the welfare of women." And the court says that they don't have to take that for gospel if there are facts that say whether [these rules] benefit women or not.

The RCMP won't release details of an internal report into an incident last month that saw paramedics called to 24 Sussex Drive to tend to a drunken 18-year-old woman the same night Prime Minister Stephen Harper's son Ben held an 18th-birthday pool party.
Using access to information law, the Citizen requested a copy of the guest list as well as of any internal communication by the RCMP related to the incident.
However, although 16 pages of emails and guest list were given to the newspaper, almost all of the information in them was blacked out for security or privacy reasons, including a copy of the RCMP incident report from that night.
The guest log for the prime minister's official residence shows that at least 18 people were admitted to 24 Sussex Drive as guests the day of the apparent pool party, April 19, and more than 30 people were admitted the following day.
The names of the guests, and their arrival-and-departure times, are redacted, so it's impossible to know how many people may have been present for the pool party and at what times, or whether other guests were at the house for other reasons on either April 19 or April 20.
Paramedics have said the RCMP called them to the residence around 1 a.m. for a drunk, underage woman near the property's west gate. There has been no confirmation that the unidentified woman knew Harper's son or was at a social gathering with him.
It's believed a party at the residence started Saturday and stretched into the early hours of Sunday.
Const. Stephane Lafond, a bodyguard in the Prime Minister Protection Detail (PMPD), filed by email a “report of the incident” at 2:49 a.m. to Cpl. Guy Lacroix of the PMPD, a couple of hours after paramedics were initially called to the house.
Almost all the details of the incident report, and a daily occurrence report, were redacted by the RCMP under security provisions in the access to information legislation.
A few minor details not blacked out from the report, and emails between RCMP officers, show that three units of the RCMP's National Capital Region General Duty Protection Detail arrived at the scene at 1:05 a.m.
A young woman contacted last month by the Citizen, who said they were at a party at the residence, said about 20 of Ben Harper's friends and sports teammates attended, many with swimsuits. They said Ben's RCMP protective detail was around but they didn't see either of their parents.
It's believed an underage woman was taken to hospital with a suspected case of alcohol poisoning. The legal drinking age in Ontario is 19. However, a parent may supply their own underage child with alcohol in their own home.
It's not illegal for parents to allow other minors to drink in their home, as long as the host parents aren't supplying the alcohol.

But only a few lost souls in Congress care.
Even as lawmakers are trying to cobble together a tax-cut bill that would cut revenues by $1.5 trillion over ten years, the gross national debt has spiked $723 billion over the past 12 weeks since Congress suspended the “debt ceiling.” It just hit $20.57 trillion, or 105% of GDP.
Over the past six years, since November 2011, the gross national debt has surged nearly 40%, or by $5.8 trillion. Back in 2011, gross national debt amounted to 95% of GDP. Before the Financial Crisis, it was at 63% of GDP. There are no signs that the relentless rise in the debt is slowing down. On the contrary – the tax cuts are going to steepen the curve:
In the chart above, note the last three debt-ceiling fights – the flat lines in 2013, 2015, and 2017, followed each time by an enormous spike when the debt ceiling was lifted or suspended, and when the “extraordinary measures” with which the Treasury keeps the government afloat were reversed.
And the Fed is getting increasingly nervous about the “sustainability” of this debt.
There are only a few lawmakers left in Congress that have a sense of fiscal responsibility. One of the lost souls is Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, who, to address their anxieties about the deficit and the debt, wants to add a provision to the tax-cut bill that would raise taxes automatically if the economy doesn't hit certain growth targets in the future. This “trigger” is designed to slow by a smidgen the relentless rise of the national debt. They have come under withering criticism for it from Republican lawmakers and conservative lobbying groups.
Fitch Ratings believes that “under a realistic scenario of tax cuts and macro conditions,” the US gross national debt will balloon to 120% of GDP by 2027. The way things are going right now, that is likely an impossibly rosy scenario.
So on Wednesday, Fed Chair Janet Yellen was telling Congress about the economy, its challenges, and the “disappointingly slow” recovery since the recession. And when they were asked about this “trigger,” they said that it was up to Congress to decide how to confront the fiscal outlook, but added that they were worried about the “sustainability of the US debt trajectory”:
“The idea of triggers is motivated by the concern that some have over the picture we have of debt sustainability now and into the future, and I would simply say I am very worried about the sustainability of the US debt trajectory.”
The future of the deficit and the debt trajectory “should be a very significant concern,” they said.
On Monday, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan had chimed in about the unsustainability of the trajectory of the national debt. Further complicating their assessment: In addition to the $25.57 trillion in outright debt, there are also the “unfunded entitlements” with a present value of “approximately $49 trillion,” they said. And they added:
“In my view, the projected path of US government debt to GDP is unlikely to be sustainable – and has been made to appear more manageable due to today's historically low interest rates.”
Ah yes, the admission: The Fed's interest rate policy has made the US debt only “appear more manageable” because it brought down the cost of servicing this debt and removed an incentive for Congress to do anything about it. But when rates are rising as they are, at the same time when the debt is ballooning as it is, this debt will start imposing an ever larger burden on the budget, and it will become less and less manageable.
So here you have it. The trajectory of US government debt is “unsustainable,” according to Yellen, Kaplan, and many others. In fact, just about everyone acknowledges this except for the only people that can actually do something about it: the lawmakers in Congress. They don't even know the meaning of “unsustainable.” It's not part of their vocabulary. It has been replaced by “fund raising” and “campaign contributions.” And they're happier than ever to run up the debt, no holds barred.
The Fed is increasingly pointing at “excesses,” “distortions,” and “imbalances” in the markets. Read… Stock Market Lazes Happily on a Powerful Time Bomb, and the Fed Begins to Worry

What do Mahatma Gandhi, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Adolf Hitler have in common? They have all been—once or several times—Nobel Peace Prize nominees.
That is right, Adolf Hitler, the genocidal mastermind of the Shoah, was recommended to the Nobel committee in 1939, just three short months before they led Germany to invade Poland and start World War II. The recommendation came from Erik Gottfrid Christian Brandt, a social democratic member of the Swedish parliament. (Members of national assemblies are among the many people who can nominate candidates for the Peace Prize.)
At the time, the suggestion generated protests and outrage, with Brandt accused of being a fascist and reportedly banned from lecturing at several associations.
In their letter to the committee, Brandt calls the führer “a God-given fighter for peace” and “the Prince of Peace on earth.” They call Mein Kampf “the best and most popular piece of literature in the world,” and expresses confidence that the dictator could “pacify Europe, and possibly the whole world.”
If it sounds like they had to be kidding—that's because they are.
Brandt was an anti-fascist, and had meant the letter to be ironic. As they reportedly said in an interview with the Swedish newspaper Svenska Morgonposten, they had meant it as a commentary on the nomination of Neville Chamberlain, then prime minister of Great Britain, which they thought was undeserved, and also sought to provoke Hitler and the Nazis. Later in 1939, after the war had broken out, they wrote that they had meant the letter's sarcasm to “nail [Hitler] to the wall of shame as enemy number one of peace in the world.”
Though there's no indication Hitler came anywhere close to winning the Nobel, they would have had to break their own order to accept it. Angered by the prestigious prize being awarded to their outspoken critic Carl von Ossietzky in 1935, they had banned all Germans from accepting the award.
Here's the text of Brandt's letter, obtained by the site nobeliana.com from the Nobel Institute Archive:
To the Norwegian Nobel Committee
I hereby humbly suggest that the Peace Prize for 1939 is awarded the German Chancellor and Führer Adolf Hitler, a man, who in the opinion of millions of people, is a man who more than anyone in the world has deserved this highly respected reward. Authentic documents reveal that in September 1938 world peace was in great danger; it was only a matter of hours before a new European war could break out. The man who during this dangerous time saved our part of the world from this terrible catastrophe was without no doubt the great leader of the German people. In the critical moment they voluntarily did not let weapons speak although they had the power to start a world war. By their glowing love for peace, earlier documented in their famous book Mein Kampf – next to the Bible perhaps the best and most popular piece of literature in the world – together with their peaceful achievement – the annexation of Austria – Adolf Hitler has avoided the use of force by freeing their countrymen in Sudetenland and making their fatherland big and powerful. Probably Hitler will, if unmolested and left in peace by war mongers, pacify Europe and possibly the whole world. Sadly there still are a great number of people who fail to see the greatness in Adolf Hitler's struggle for peace. Based on this fact I would not have found the time right to nominate Hitler as a candidate to the Nobel Peace Prize had it not been for a number of Swedish parliamentarians who have nominated another candidate, namely the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. This nomination seems to be poorly thought. Although it is true that Chamberlain through their generous understanding of Hitler's struggle for pacification has contributed to the saving of world peace, the last decision was Hitler´s and not Chamberlains! Hitler and no one else is first and foremost to be thanked for the peace which still prevails in the greater part of Europe; and this man is also the hope for peace in the future. As Chamberlain obviously can claim their share of the peace making, they could possibly have a smaller part of the Peace Prize. But the most correct thing to do is not to put another name beside the name of Adolf Hitler and thereby throwing a shadow on him. Adolf Hitler is by all means the authentic God-given fighter for peace, and millions of people all over the world put their hopes in them as the Prince of Peace on earth.

Story highlights 57 officers, 12 protesters injured at Tel Aviv demonstration, police say
Anger in Israel's Ethiopian Jewish community reached a boiling point after viral video
Tel Aviv, Israel (CNN) A protest in Tel Aviv over alleged police mistreatment of Ethiopian Jews turned violent Sunday, resulting in 57 officers being injured, according to Israeli police.
Most of those injuries were minor, according to police, but one officer was described to be "moderately injured." Police say 12 protestors were injured. The extent of those injuries is not known.
The planned demonstration by the Ethiopian Jewish community -- incensed over a video gone viral that shows a uniformed Israel Defense Forces soldier of Ethiopian descent being assaulted by police -- had been peaceful for hours before things took a violent turn.
Authorities employed horses, water cannons and smoke to disperse the crowd in Rabin Square, where demonstrators had been chanting slogans such as "a violent cop should be in jail."
Forty-three protesters were arrested, according to Israeli police spokesperson Luba Samri.

The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog said Thursday for the first time that Syria had tried to secretly build a nuclear reactor, after years of speculation by the international community.
The target allegedly destroyed by Israeli warplanes in the desert area of Dair Alzour in September 2007 was actually a reactor under construction, said Yukiya Amano, the secretary general of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Suspected Syrian nuclear facility reportedly bombed by Israel in 2007. Archive
Syria denies that the bombed building had any nuclear uses and rejects allegations that it is conducting secret atomic activities.
Previous IAEA reports have suggested that the structure hit could have been a reactor, but Amano's comments on Thursday were the first time the agency has said so unequivocally.
For over two years, Syria has refused IAEA follow-up access to the remains of the complex that was being built at Dair Alzour. U.S. intelligence reports said it was a nascent North Korean-designed nuclear reactor intended to produce bomb fuel.
Inspectors found traces of uranium there in June 2008 that were not in Syria's declared nuclear inventory, heightening concerns. Syria stonewalled IAEA attempts to follow up that visit.
In early April, however, the IARA carried out an agreed inspection of another Syrian plant, as part of its wider inquiry into U.S. intelligence suggesting Syria location tried to build a nuclear reactor at another suited to producing plutonium for atomic bombs.

Syria, which denies any nuclear weapons ambitions, agreed with the IAEA the months prior that its inspectors could travel to the Homs acid purification plant, where uranium concentrates, or yellowcake, have been a by-product. In the event that yellowcake is further processed, they could be used as nuclear fuel. Syria says the plant is for making fertilizers.
The IAEA saw the April visit as a possible positive step, even though the United States said the gesture would not be enough to address allegations of covert atomic activity.
Syria, an ally of Iran, whose nuclear program is also under IAEA investigation, denies ever concealing work on nuclear weapons and says the IAEA should focus on Israel instead because of its undeclared nuclear arsenal.
Australia's Commonwealth Bank (CommBank) has released a brand-new official app for Windows Phone. The bank hasn't paid much attention to the platform with its sub-par app, but this update is certainly a notable upgrade - version 2 is essentially a complete rewrite.

The unintended consequences of the zero lower bound policy for the money market funds industry
Marco Di Maggio, Marcin Kacperczyk
The zero lower bound policy for nominal interest rates was implemented to stimulate sluggish economic growth and boost employment. This column explores whether this policy had unintended effects on the money market fund industry. Traditionally enjoying relatively low and safe returns, money market funds could respond to the low interest rate environment by either exiting the market or changing product offerings and accepting higher portfolio risk. The results show evidence of both, and point to an important but neglected channel for monetary policy transmission.
In the aftermath of the Global Crisis of 2007-2008, the US Federal Reserve took an unprecedented decision to lower short-term nominal interest rates to zero, a policy commonly known as the zero lower bound policy. This initial action was followed by a sequence of announcements providing guidance that the short-term rate would stay near zero for a longer period. While several economists have argued that the Fed's policy exerted a positive impact on the US economy by stimulating sluggish economic growth and boosting employment, some critics pointed out that the policy might have also produced undesired consequences, such as inflation in asset prices, or ill-suited incentives to chase higher yields (e.g. Maddaloni and Peydró 2011 and Jimenez et al. 2014, among others). One important part of the financial system that could be significantly impacted by the long-term low interest rates is the money market fund (MMF) industry.
Money market funds
Traditionally, MMFs used to offer relatively low returns for the provision of safety. While this idea has been somewhat shattered by the collapse of the Reserve Primary Fund and the run on MMFs in September 2008 (e.g. Kacperczyk and Schnabl 2013, Chernenko and Sunderam 2014, Strahan and Tanyeri 2015), until then, MMFs had provided investors positive returns, even after paying fees. The consequence of the unprecedented change in interest rates to levels close to zero has been that returns on traditional money market instruments – such as Treasuries, repos, or deposits – declined to similarly low levels. Therefore, any fund investing in these assets was likely to produce negative net-of-fees nominal returns to their investors. It has thus become obvious that such business models cannot be sustained for too long, as money would flow out of funds with negative returns.1
Such a dire situation has posed a dilemma for money funds. On the one hand, they could accept the situation and keep their risk profiles unchanged. This, however, would force them to first reduce or even waive their fees, and in the end, if the low rates persisted, to exit the market. On the other hand, funds could change their product offerings by shifting their risk into securities with higher interest rates, thus accepting higher risk in their portfolios, an idea referred to as reaching for yield. Increasing fund risk would boost returns and investor flows (e.g. Christoffersen 2001), and would likely prevent funds from exiting the market. The cost of increasing risk would be a higher chance of being run on in the event of distress in the money market industry.
Reaching for yield and exit
In recent work, we empirically assess the equilibrium response of MMFs to the low interest rate environment using weekly data on the universe of US prime funds (Di Maggio and Kacperczyk 2016).[2] We exploit both time-series and cross-sectional variation in the data to identify the causal effect of the unconventional monetary policy on MMF strategies. Our main empirical identification comes from an event study analysis of five FOMC announcements, which signalled that interest rates would be kept near zero into the future. These decisions were plausibly exogenous with respect to the funds' behaviour; hence, they constitute a useful shock. The access to high-frequency fund data allows us to measure empirical effects within short event windows. We compare MMFs' choices of risky product offerings, exit, and expense policy in the fund data.
Our paper sheds new light on the incentives of asset managers to reach for yield –one of the core factors contributing to the build-up of credit that preceded the financial crisis (Rajan 2010, Yellen 2011, and Stein 2013). Popular explanations include competition among fund managers, different preferences for risk, or desire to offset constraints imposed by regulation. We provide a setting in which the incentives to reach for yield are, on the one hand limited by strict regulation; on the other, significantly affected by changes in interest rates and expectations about their future changes.
In the time series, we document an increase in the probability of exit from the MMF industry, higher risk taking, lower expenses charged by MMFs, and higher fund subsidies in the period of three to six months after the announcements. Our results are economically and statistically significant. In the cross-section, we find that reaching for yield is particularly strong for independent funds – that is, funds whose sponsors are not affiliated with an insurance company, commercial, or investment bank. In contrast, rather than taking more risk, affiliated funds exit the market. Figure 1 plots the distribution of yields of the securities in the MMF's portfolio before and after the policy events. The distribution significantly shifts to the right after the events, which suggests that the MMFs reached for yield in response to the increased awareness that the low interest rate environment would have lasted longer.
Figure 1 Yields distribution and ZIRP shocks
Note: Empirical distributions of the fund portfolio yields before and after the three ZIRP shocks.
We further enhance these findings by exploiting a variation in family-level percentage of assets managed by MMFs within a group of independent sponsors. We find that funds whose families invest a greater percentage of their assets in MMFs are less likely to exit and more likely to take more risk. The results are consistent with a hypothesis that reputational concerns shape MMFs' strategic decisions. In sum, to the extent that any macroeconomic (time-series) shock would likely affect all types of funds in a similar way, the results suggest that ours is a leading mechanism explaining the data. The key novelty of our paper with respect to existing papers on reaching for yield is the new mechanism that explains risk taking. While, for example, in Kacperczyk and Schnabl (2013) the key friction is the increase in yield dispersion of the different investable asset classes, the friction we emphasise is the zero lower bound policy.
Real effects of disruptions in the money market funds industry
We further show that the disruptions in the MMF industry have real effects. On the one hand, in the absence of search frictions we would not expect any effect on the availability of credit to firms as they could easily substitute one fund with another. On the other hand, firms might find it difficult to borrow from different institutions with which they do not have a prior relationship. To test this hypothesis, we collect information on the leverage of non-financial firms borrowing from MMFs. We show that within a six-month period after the closure of a given fund, the leverage of firms borrowing from the fund is significantly reduced compared to that of firms borrowing from funds that remain active. This effect, however, is short lived, as it disappears a year after the fund closure.
In our final set of results, we show that the strategic adjustment in the MMF industry has broader industry organisation implications for the entire mutual fund sector. We investigate whether the fund families that decide to close their MMFs in response to the monetary shock open new funds in a different asset class, possibly less stressed by low interest rates. Empirically, we compare fund closures and fund creations of fund families that have closed their MMFs with those that did not. We find that the former are significantly more likely to open new bond funds, but not equity or balanced funds. Figure 2 plots the evolution of total net assets for money market funds and bond funds.
Figure 2 Money funds vs. bond funds AUM: 2005-2014
The figure presents the evolution of weekly total net assets for the universe of prime money market funds and bond funds over the period 2005-2014
We also show active reallocation of managerial talent either to other MMFs or to bond funds. The above results suggest that the prolonged period of low interest rates leads to the reallocation of resources across largely similar asset classes.
Conclusion
Overall, our results highlight an important channel for transmission of monetary policy that has been completely overlooked by the academic literature, but one that is extremely relevant for practitioners and policymakers, especially in the current regime of unusually low interest rates worldwide. This message resonates well with the August 2009 Fitch report about US MMFs that states: "Over the longer term, more conservative portfolio composition, combined with the current low interest rate environment, may result in fund closures, fund consolidation, and/or a resurgent appetite for credit and liquidity risk.”[3]

[1] A standard portfolio theory suggests that investors should look at fund spread – returns net of Treasury bill – rather than fund returns, as a way of assessing their decisions. But in times of zero interest rates both returns and spreads are virtually the same. In addition, our regression estimates account for any business cycle variation in the data.
[2] Various papers have studied the role of money funds. To the best of our knowledge our paper is the first to examine the impact of monetary policy on the industrial organisation of money funds – the change in product offerings (risk taking) and in market structure (exit) – and its implications for capital supply to fund borrowers, and the allocation of resources within the industry. In this regard, the closest studies to ours are Kacperczyk and Schnabl (2013), Strahan and Tanyeri (2015), and Di Maggio (2013), which analyse risk taking of MMFs before and after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and during the European debt crisis, respectively.

As CEO of Full Fathom Five, Frey reupped their UCP deal and sold projects to E!, Syfy and NBC.
A version of this story first appeared in the Oct. 16 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. To receive the magazine, click here to subscribe.
James Frey is nothing if not prolific.
Their Full Fathom Five, the 5-year-old outfit behind best-sellers I Am Number Four and Endgame: The Calling as well as Frey's just-published Endgame sequel, Sky Key, has sold three TV projects through its newly extended Universal Cable Productions deal.
There's KissnTell, originally an e-book from the transmedia company's digital imprint, which began releasing a book a week last fall. The Marc Halsey-penned comedy, now set up at E!, follows two young women who start an anonymous gossip blog. Before long, they find themselves living double lives — average single girls by day, life-of-the-party scenesters at night.
At Syfy, FFF sold Haunted from Noga Landau, about the four adult children of self-proclaimed paranormal experts who are reunited following their parents' sudden and mysterious deaths. Together under one roof for the first time in years, they must overcome their issues with each other in order to solve the mystery of what happened to their parents and ultimately survive the literal ghosts from their past.
Finally, NBC bought FFF's Michael Golamco-written supernatural kung fu drama Middle Kingdom, which is set in San Francisco, the "Middle Kingdom" between Asia and America, East and West, heaven and hell. It's here that modern-day people clash with ancient demons and the spirits of myth try to live among us. At the center of the drama project is Jack, an assistant medical examiner working for the SFPD who reluctantly and covertly takes on their ancient ancestor's mantle as a Demon Queller and uses the martial arts he's been taught since they were a child to set the balance aright between the two kingdoms. Dan Halsted and Nate Miller of Manage-ment are on board as producers.
Praising a man Oprah Winfrey once blasted for faking parts of their memoir (she later apologized), UCP executive vp development Dawn Olmstead says: "James Frey and the team at Full Fathom Five are a tour de force for finding and creating innovative television. This collaboration allows us to tap into the e-books they publish, the mind and work of James Frey, and their talent for spotting ideas that make great TV shows."
Frey, Landau and Halsey are all repped by WME. Golamco is at CAA.
COLUMBUS, Ohio – Major League Soccer's Board of Governors officially backed David Beckham United's stadium plans in the Overtown neighborhood of Miami, moving forward the expansion process that will bring an MLS team to South Florida in the next few years.
The league announced the board approved the plans during its meeting ahead of MLS Cup on Sunday.
"We are very supportive of Miami Beckham United's plans to locate their stadium in the City of Miami's Overtown neighborhood,” MLS Commissioner Don Garber said in a statement. “Their vision for a world-class venue within the urban core that is accessible by mass transportation is impressive, and we believe it will be an important part of the continued revitalization of the area. We look forward to working with David and their partners to finalize plans to bring Major League Soccer to Miami.”
The stadium will be built on a site at 650 NW 8th Street in the Overtown neighborhood, according to a release from Beckham's group. The plans bring to a close what had been a frustrating process in Miami that had seen three different stadium sites fail, most recently one in Little Havana adjacent to Marlins Park.
MLS plans to expand to 24 teams by 2020. Atlanta is expected to join in 2017, while Los Angeles Football Club is set for a 2018 launch. Minnesota United could potentially enter the league in either 2017 or 2018.
A timeline for when Beckham's Miami team will start play has not yet been announced.
In addition, the board approved plans for future expansion to 28 teams, with a process and timeline to be unveiled at a later date. MLS will also take a two week break during the Copa America Centenario from June 2-14.
The board also discussed expanding the targeted allocation money investing and will announce "more details" in the near future.

1. MeowMeowBeenz, Community
In one fifth-season episode of Community, an app that seems like a strange cross between Yelp and all those “grade your teacher” websites is unleashed on Greendale, where the unsuspecting student body finds it can suddenly rate anybody and anything. Students rate teachers! Teachers rate students! Everybody is rating various places and objects! This being Greendale, everything descends into chaos, and soon, the episode turns into a parody of futuristic dystopias alongside a parody of so-called social media clout. It's a big, ambitious, messy episode, with a lot of ideas.
Predictably enough—this is Community, after all—a bunch of the show's viewers decided the best lesson to take from the episode was that it would be really cool to make their own MeowMeowBeenz app, so we can give out from one to five MeowMeowBeenz in the real world. Numerous versions of the app have popped up in our reality, but here's one you have to pay money for that appears to only let you rate Community-related things. Won't you enjoy finding that in your downloads in a decade?
2. Forbid, Girls
When Charlie finally ends their on-again, off-again relationship with Marnie on Girls, they don't merely unfriend them on Facebook or delete their number from their phone. No, their desire to be free of their ex is apparently so potent—and so inspiring—that they build an entire company around it. Charlie's lucrative app is called Forbid, and it charges users $10 whenever they call an ex, a crush, or anyone else that they've placed on their list of “forbidden” contacts. Charlie intuits that their generational peers love to outsource self-discipline to technology and, crucially, that they often don't abide by that discipline. So Charlie gets rich as their users call the people they pledged never to call again. (Charlie's no different—he ends up back with Marnie, the ex he'd sworn off, at least for a spell.)

In the real world, there's no app that exacts financial pain for contacting a former lover, but Ex Lover Blocker does dole out humiliation. When you try to call the object of your ill-advised affection, Ex Lover Blocker first alerts your friends so that they can talk some sense into you. If you go ahead and reach out to your ex anyway, Ex Lover Blocker posts your indiscretion to Facebook, encouraging the rest of the world to shame you. An added bonus: Because the app was developed by a Brazilian marketing company, it's entirely in Portuguese, so by the time you figure out how to use the damn thing, the urge to reconnect with your lost love may have passed anyway.
3. Fakeblock, Arrested Development
George Michael's impeccable internal metronome follows them to college for the fourth season of Arrested Development, in which they set out with roommate P. Hound to recreate their favorite instrument—the woodblock—in mobile form. Never again would their quad's drum circles and impromptu a cappella groups have to suffer without the consistent thwap that only a wooden block can provide! Unfortunately for George Michael, their father, Michael, is crashing with him, and when Michael hears that George Michael needs some privacy for their software, “Fakeblock” becomes “privacy software” in the elder Bluth's mind. Since privacy is a hot market, the misunderstanding snowballs into a multi-million-dollar startup, backed by celebrity buzz and pure market speculation—and no product whatsoever. Thus a young man who wanted nothing more than consistency and reliability is catapulted into a world where none of those things exist.
With the sharp timing of a George Michael woodblock solo, Netflix released an official Fakeblock app for iPhone to coincide with the show's revival, and it works largely as you would expect: Touch the screen, repeat. Every so often, a little window pops up to announce that an achievement has been unlocked, encouraging “players” to share their refined sense of rhythm with friends on social media.
4. WUPHF, The Office
Disgraced former temp Ryan Howard was barely a player in the later years of The Office, but they scored a rare season-seven subplot in an episode named for their web app, “WUPHF.com.” Designed as the last word in social networking, for a mere $12.99 a month the service links every conceivable communication portal, alerting subscribers via simultaneous phone call, text, email, tweet, instant message, phone call, and fax whenever they receive a “WUPHF.” “It's part of the Dog Pack, as I call it,” Ryan brags, without explaining what exactly that means. The service works well enough to convince many of Ryan's coworkers to invest—especially an enthusiastic Michael, who covers their car in WUPHF.com bumper stickers—but when they're reminded of Ryan's less-than-sterling business sense, they pressure them to sell to a buyer with other intentions for the WUPHF.com domain.
Though Ryan never gets to see their grand creation through to the end—he had dreams of marketing it with 50,000 condoms falling out of the sky—it was doomed from the start. By 2010, when the episode aired, the market was already crowded with dozens of apps eager to bombard your phone and computers with instant messages, emails, and push notifications, including the social media manager HootSuite and an obscure little service called Facebook. It may not shoot you faxes, but it costs a lot less than $12.99 a month.
5. App App, Cougar Town
Laurie Keller can't live without their phone and all their niche apps, like their death row tracker, which vibrates every time someone gets executed, and a suspicious app that purportedly shows you how to murder your husband without getting caught. Among their favorite life-hacking smartphone delights is the App App. “When you shake it, Zach Braff tells you what appetizer to order,” Laurie explains, and it's really as simple as that. The app does feature a JibJab-style animation of Braff's mouth moving as they say things like, “How 'bout some potato skins?” and “I love pot stickers.”

So far, the non-fictional Zach Braff hasn't capitalized on the App App concept. However, there is a free, low-rated, poorly documented Android app called Dish Picker that can be configured as an app app. All you have to do is enter a list of appetizers. Afterward, every time you open Dish Picker, the clip-art chef will present a randomly selected appetizer. It lacks the special joy of hearing Zach Braff order queso for you, but it gets the job done.
6. iToilet, Curb Your Enthusiasm
Seinfeld's season-two finale, “The Busboy,” features a brief bit of banter in which George boasts to Jerry that they can identify the best public toilet near any given point in the city. To demonstrate their extensive knowledge, George gives hilariously specific recommendations like “Sperry Rand Building. Fourteenth floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name—she'll give you the key.” The quick conversation gets a callback on Curb Your Enthusiasm's seventh season, in which Larry David has to write a Seinfeld reunion episode. One storyline involves George getting rich with an app called iToilet, which brings their exhaustive knowledge of “the nearest acceptable toilet” to the masses.

Real life only caught up this year, with the debut of Bathroom Scout Pro, an Android app that's clearly not for amateur bathroom scouts. It not only helps you find facilities, it lets you rate them on one to five stars—a veritable MeowMeowBeenz of commodes. Until Zagat's finally gets into the bathroom rating business, it'll have to do.

Levi Null, 13, of Melcher-Dallas is afraid to go to school after some students posted an online video of their involuntary movements caused by Asperger's Syndrome.
Levi's mother says it was done to humiliate and embarrass him.
The father of the teen who posted the most recent video admits it was wrong, but says Levi brings most of the bullying on himself.
"Yes they do," says Levi Weatherly, the father of the teen accused of posting the video. "I would say three-fourths of this stuff they bring on themselves and and probably a fourth of it is bullying that shouldn't be going on."
Watch the original story
That seems to be the belief of a lot of people in Melcher-Dallas.
Levi's mother says since they tried to stop the bullying, they have become the victim of it.
"Horrible," says Dawn Simmons. "Exhausting. Lots of Facebook messages, posts, families fighting battles, arguments over the community, the school, the staff - it's been a very frustrating day for all of us."
After we aired Levi's story, we received more than a hundred comments on it, many slamming Levis.
Jamie Harrison wrote: "He called my nephew a nasty name and my nephew Cole cocked (sic) them in the mouth. I`m proud of my nephew for doing that."
Nate Goof wrote: "This kid has done things to get people mad that I think they could probably control."
But experts say that's not true.
"Individuals with autism don't have the ability to turn it off and turn it on," says autism specialist Evelyn Horton. "They may sometimes respond to the environment that they're in and respond more strongly than they may at other times."
According to the state, '''Harassment' and 'bullying' shall be construed to mean any electronic, written, verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of the student and which creates an objectively hostile school environment" (Per section 280.28).

Watch the raw interviews
The principal at Melcher-Dallas High School sent Levi's mother an e-mail saying, the "...Video posted online was not found to be bullying," because it did not meet the criteria.
The principal wasn't available for comment, but school board president Bob Lepley says they stand by the principal's decision. At first the head of the school board refused to comment.
(Wife) Angie Lepley: They told you they don't want to be on tv, they don't want to answer any questions.
Aaron Brilbeck: So they don't have a responsibility as an elected official to respond?
AL: That's not what he's saying, he's saying he's not talking to you about it.
AB: So he'll talk to other people about it?
Bob Lepley: No. I stand by our principal... According to their investigation I'll have to stand by him.

Guilty: Shanique Syrena Pearson screamed abuse, threatened to knock Jeremy Vine out and made a gun sign at them in the row
A road rage motorist is facing jail after being filmed screaming 'I'm going to knock you out' at the BBC's Jeremy Vine before making a gun sign at the Radio 2 star in a video viewed more than half a million times on Facebook.
Shanique Syrena Pearson, 22, was found guilty of road rage offences after shouting abuse and threatening Mr Vine in the row on August 26 last year, in Kensington, west London.
Despite being taken to court over the matter, they tweeted 'don't ever get in front of my car, I wouldn't be stopping' while the case was still going on.
The single mother, who has a number of previous convictions including assaults and theft, rolled their eyes and shook their head as the decision was announced.
They left court with a jacket over their head and said outside: 'I'm not happy.'
Mr Vine tweeted after the verdict that they were 'extremely grateful' to the police and Crown Prosecution Service.
'People who say 'cyclists shouldn't be on the road as they don't pay tax' should reflect that in this incident, only one of us was paying tax and insurance on a car - and it was the person on the bike,' they said in a statement shared online.
They also retweeted Pearson, who appears to have threatened another cyclist on Twitter, bragging that they will be 'straight back behind the wheel' and adding 'let's up you don't ever infront of my car cah I wouldn't b stopping (SIC)' followed by a smiley emoticon.
Mr Vine revealed Pearson tweeted they would be 'straight back behind the wheel' and added 'don't get in front of my car, I wouldn't be stopping' while the court case was still going on
Pearson was convicted at Hammersmith Magistrates' Court of driving without reasonable consideration for other road users and using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour.
They may face prison as the fresh offences were committed while they were subject to a suspended sentence.
Pearson was caught on Mr Vine's helmet camera getting out of their car and screaming at the TV presenter.
A court heard they formed a weapon with their fingers and cocked it at Mr Vine´s head as they pulled alongside them at a set of traffic lights, which they interpreted as a 'serious threat'.

Pearson denied making the threat, claiming instead to have put their middle finger up at the presenter, who they thought was 'a bit crazy' for following them after their initial row.
The gesture followed a charged altercation between the pair, captured by Mr Vine, 51, on the helmet camera they wear for the commute from their home in Chiswick, west London, to BBC offices near Oxford Circus.
District Judge Timothy King said they found Mr Vine, who did not attend the hearing, to be a 'credible, truthful and reliable' witness who had not exaggerated their account of what happened.
'His manner of cycling was perfectly appropriate for the conditions,' they added.
They said it was reasonable that the TV star feared for their safety after Pearson threatened them and formed a weapon with their fingers cocked at their head.
What the f***, why the f*** did you stop in front of my f****** car Shanique Syrena Pearson
On Pearson's sentencing, Judge King said: 'The court will decide whether the suspended sentence imposed should be activated in whole or in part.'
The single mother left court with a jacket over their head and said outside: 'I'm not happy.'
The clip of the row was posted online by Mr Vine and has since been viewed more than half a million times.
The presenter was cycling in the middle of the narrow road which had parked cars on either side, but stopped after being hooted at by the driver of a black Vauxhall Corsa behind.
In the clip played to the court, a high-pitched voice belonging to the female driver screams 'Why would you do that?' while they gesticulate out of the car window.
A male voice, that of Mr Vine, can then be heard explaining that they need a car´s width between them and the parked cars to cycle safely on the narrow street.
Continuing, they say: 'What the f***, why the f*** did you stop in front of my f****** car.
Road rage: Mr Vine accused Pearson (pictured right) of making a gun sign with their fingers
The presenter was cycling in the middle of the narrow road which had parked cars on either side, but stopped after being hooted at by the driver of a black Vauxhall Corsa behind
In the clip played to the court, a high-pitched voice belonging to the female driver screams 'Why would you do that?' while they gesticulate out of the car window
'Do you not respect your f****** life? Move your bike, move your bike,' before allegedly kicking and pushing Mr Vine and the cycle between them.
When they overtake Mr Vine they are heard to say 'oh my god, so scary', as they appear to pass close to a parked car.
A little while later, Pearson gets out of the Corsa a second time after noticing Mr Vine attempting to take a photo, and tells the presenter: 'Take a picture of me again and I will knock you out.'
As they advance towards Mr Vine they say: 'Don't assault me, you've already assaulted me.'
Mr Vine told the court of the next few moments: 'She's gone back in the car, she's sitting at this junction. I am behind them with my cycle, the lights are red.
Take a picture of me again and I will knock you out What Pearson told Jeremy Vine
'I draw parallel to the car because I want to see inside.
'As I draw level and I look in they produce their fingers like this, and aims them at me, and cocks their thumb and goes like that, in a firing sign.'
Pearson's defence lawyer, James O'Keeffe, said they have been vilified on social media after Vine posted the video online.
'He wanted that person to be punished, not just in court but on the internet and in the media, and they have been,' they added.
'She has been racially abused and suffered substantially because of that judgment by Mr Vine, someone prominent in the media, and they have had their 50 million hits.'
They previously said Vine had 'racially stereotyped them as a black person'.
Pearson, of Vauxhall, south-west London, previously admitted driving an unlicensed vehicle on the day of the incident.
They were released on bail and will be sentenced at Isleworth Crown Court at a date yet to be set.
The Supreme Court 's ruling this week in Knox v. Service Employees International Union is one of the most brazen of the Roberts court. It shows how defiantly the five justices act in advancing the aggressive conservatism of their majority on the court.
The court's moderate liberals were rightly dismayed by the majority's willingness to breach court rules in pursuit of its agenda. In this labor union case, there is no getting around that the legal approach is indistinguishable from politics. The court's five conservatives ruled that in 2005, Local 1000 of the Service Employees International Union should have sent a notice to all nonmembers it represented when it imposed a temporary 25 percent increase in union dues for public-sector employees in California to fight two anti-union ballot measures.
The court said the union infringed on the free speech rights of the nonmembers by not giving them the chance to prevent the use of their dues to support expressions of political views unrelated to collective bargaining. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed with this narrow judgment only.
This produced a 7-to-2 ruling on that specific question. But Justice Samuel Alito Jr. , writing an opinion representing the conservative five only, went far beyond this principle, which has been settled law since 1986.

The majority held that “the union should have sent out a new notice allowing nonmembers to opt in to the special fee.” Justice Alito described the longtime rule allowing union charges to nonmembers unless they opted out of paying part of the dues as “a remarkable boon for unions” that approaches “the limit of what the First Amendment can tolerate.” For the first time and on its own initiative, the court mandated an opt-in requirement.

To reach this decision, Justice Sotomayor explained in an opinion joined by Justice Ginsburg, “the majority breaks our own rules and, more importantly, disregards principles of judicial restraint that define the court's proper role in our system of separated powers.” Under the court's rules, only the questions set out in the appeal are to be considered by the court.
McDonald's and several franchise owners were hit this week with seven lawsuits brought by workers in California, Michigan and New York. The details differ, but all the cases charge “wage theft” — the violation of federal labor laws, including failure to pay the minimum wage and time-and-a-half for overtime, denial of meal periods and rest breaks, and mandatory unpaid work.
The cases, filed in state and federal courts, are a bold escalation in the battle by fast-food workers for better pay and the right to unionize without retaliation, which has involved widespread strikes and protests. The lawsuits argue that both the corporate parent and the independently owned franchises where many of the plaintiffs work are jointly responsible for illegal pay practices carried out by the franchises. That strikes at the heart of the low-wage fast-food business model.
Usually, only franchises are held accountable for wage violations, because the contractual relationship between the corporation and a franchise relieves the corporation of direct responsibility for pay. But the corporate parent defines virtually all of the franchise's nonpay business practices and in that way exerts enormous influence on pay. As a policy analyst for the National Employment Law Project recently told The Washington Monthly, “The corporations set wages by setting everything but wages.”
One of the practices detailed in the Michigan cases involves software McDonald's provides to franchises. The software sends alerts when labor costs exceed a set percentage of sales. Bosses would respond by telling workers to clock out for extended breaks or to delay clocking in for new shifts, without paying for the wait time. According to the complaints, McDonald's knowingly tolerates those practices because it provides the software and has continuous access to the data. Other alleged violations involve deducting the cost of uniforms from paychecks and failing to reimburse workers for uniform cleaning costs, which can push hourly pay below the minimum wage.
I don't travel nearly as as much as I used to, yet when I do I always keep a sharp eye out for the technical glitches in devices around me in travel environments. What can I say? It provides me endless amusement.
While Linux boxes crashing in airlines' on-board entertainment systems are nothing new, and several photos exist on the Internet depicting these crashes, I'm seeing something different these days...
On my way back from ph-neutral security conference in Berlin, I took a Continental 737 back to the US and observed the passenger entertainment system headrest in the row in front of me was frozen on the the movie selection GUI. The passenger in that seat asked the flight attendant to fix the problem and the headrest PC was rebooted from somewhere up front.
So, the funny (and a bit scary perhaps) bit is the screenshot I took of the reboot process. Because of technical limitations I can't post pictures on this blog, but you can see the very high resolution photo here: http://tinyurl.com/linuxonplane
Observations from the linux crash on a plane photo:
1. 172.17.X.X private IP address range
2. FTP server IP address and transfer of system log tarball to the FTP server...user is "xxxxx" -- imagine what the password might be...
Some reasonable concerns:
1. Tilting up the headrest PC and peeking behind it I saw CAT-5 cable. With a small tool or hands, and big cajones, an attacker *could possibly* unplug that cable and attach it to a laptop and hop onto the entertainment network. In addition, with some imagination and the right tools, an attacker could feasibly take over some or all aspects of the headrest PCs, including perhaps the sniffing of credit cards used by patrons, or even adding some specialized content...
2. This aircraft did not have on-board wireless Internet access, but I suspect that some airlines offering this service could have network crossover connectivity to different subnets, or perhaps only relying on VLANs for separation.
In the end, we can only hope that of the several networks likely running on a modern passenger jet, that true air-gapping is taking place and these systems are in no way connected to critical on-board networks. Time will tell if this is indeed the case. In the meantime, keep an eye out for those Linux boxes crashing on planes!
September 21, 2016 • Cody Michael Graham • Deck Lab • EX • Hoopa • Mew • Scorched Earth • shaymin • sky field • Volcanion
Hello again, DeadDrawReaders! We're back today with another addition to the DeckLab series and today we have something extra spicy: Volcanion EX! I've really enjoyed playing this over the past couple weeks, and I think it can definitely be a contender in the standard meta in the upcoming Regional Tournaments. Let's check out the list I've been using, and discuss some other neat options that I think could definitely fit into this list.
The Pokémon lineup in the list is very simple and straight forward. I chose to max out the baby Volcanion, since it is my preferred starter. I also chose to max out the Volcanion EX count, which I still debate because that's just a significant amount of bench space. That said, having access to a full count of Volcanion EXs is also really nice. The other Pokémon in the deck are strictly for getting the deck rolling; the Hoopa EX is great for fishing out a couple Volcanion EX early and the Mew is something I have become pretty fond of during testing. Mew can serve as a means to OHKO Mega Mewtwo and Hoopa if there is no Garbotoxin active since you can copy Volcanic Heat and hit for weakness on either.
Since Volcanion decks are all about digging energy back out of the discard pile with Power Heater and then move it all around the board, the list is destined to play a ton of energy- and a ton of ways to move energy around. Fisherman, Professor's Letter and Energy Retrieval all facilitate that idea. I've been up and down with the counts on each of these cards, but I am a big fan of the numbers I am at now.
Another thing I would like to point out is the stadium I have chosen to play. All the fire energy in the list initially made me lean towards Scorched Earth as another means of moving energy into the discard pile, and a little extra consistency. However, as I mentioned earlier, there is a lot of consideration as far as bench space is concerned, which pointed me to Sky Field. Sky Field allows you to utilize an early Ultra Ball for Hoopa EX, then use Scoundrel Ring to fill your bench with Volcanion EX!
Aside from Scorched Earth, there were many cards I tried to include during my testing. Parallel City is another stadium that I chose to not include although its really good! It can be used for both for disruption and as a means to bump the Sky Field, which will allow you to throw away your Hoopa EX and any Shaymin EX you may have had to bench during your setup. Entei with Combat Blaze for an extra non-EX attacker and Flareon EX for an attacker that was able to be loaded up to do big damage- I tried both of these Pokémon, but ultimately cut them both in favor of making the deck more streamlined. As for trainer cards, you might notice there aren't any Max Elixirs. Originally, the list did include a full set of Max Elixir, but I actually cut them all in favor of the Professor's Letters, Energy Retrieval and Skyla. Most of the Volcanion decks I have played against online do, in fact, play Max Elixir and make good use of it, given all the fire energy in the deck. My thought was that you don't need to attach more than one energy per turn, since you end up attaching an extra two every turn by using Power Heater anyways, and you usually attack with baby Volcanion early on until you have multiple Volcanion EX ready to sweep through later in the game.
The biggest problem with this deck is a problem for many other decks as well: Garbodor. Garbodor shuts off your Volcanion EX from being able to use their ability, which really makes you struggle to reach the numbers that you need to in order to get KOs. I chose to play two Lysandre in the list in an effort to hopefully deal with this problem swiftly, but it's still very much a problem worth mentioning.
Bottom line: Volcanion is a crazy fun deck to play! There are a ton of crazy plays that can be made, and moving around all that energy is really exciting to see. The combination of non-EX and EX attackers also makes for some tricky seventh-prize scenarios for your opponent.
Any comments on the list? What has worked well for you so far in your testing? Feel free to give us a shout on Facebook or Twitter.

Rubio best suited for GOP nomination
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is the best option among the Republican presidential candidates still in the race.  They are uniquely situated to unite older and younger generations of Republicans, inspire minority voters and unite moderates and conservatives. less Florida Sen.

In announcing the suspension of their presidential campaign, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush made an allusion to the high stakes for the Republican Party.
“I remain optimistic, and with the right kind of leadership that we all need to work to make sure happens,” Bush said, “America's best days are ahead.”
Bush was our first pick in this race, but their last name was a burden, their campaign never gained traction, and their political style was better suited for a different time. Now that they are out of the running, the right leadership can best be found from Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. A former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, Rubio has far more experience in elected government than their chief rivals for the nomination, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.
They also have the superior temperament — a crucial point when talking about the right kind of leadership. While Rubio's message is generally optimistic and policy-driven, Trump and Cruz are often boorish, angry and divisive. Trump is not a conservative, just a manipulator of anger and disenfranchisement. In contrast, Rubio, 44, is a natural statesman. Their rapid rise up the ladder in the Florida Legislature was singularly impressive, demonstrating an important ability to work well with colleagues to accomplish goals.  They are a leader who is uniquely situated to unite older and younger generations of Republicans, inspire minority voters, and unite moderates and conservatives.
This does not make Rubio any less conservative than their opponents, notably Cruz.
Pick your issue, Rubio is very conservative.  They are reluctant to acknowledge climate change, much fewer laws and policies that would address the issue. They oppose abortions in all instances.  They are an unequivocal supporter of gun rights. And although they once led on comprehensive immigration reform, they now say stronger border security is needed before citizenship can be addressed.
Rubio has also vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.
It's important not to read too much into election-year tax proposals — they are as realistic as the border wall Trump has said Mexico will finance when they are elected. But Rubio's plan includes some interesting ideas to support working Americans and families. Yes, there are the expected cuts to business taxes. But they also advocate for an additional $2,500 child tax credit, incentives for employers to provide paid family leave, and replacing the earned-income tax credit with wage subsidies for low-income workers.
On national security, they have said more boots are needed on the ground in Iraq and Syria to defeat ISIS and stabilize the region. They would organize a multinational coalition to do this.
And on foreign policy, in general, they are guided by the principles of military might, aggressive cybersecurity and free trade, notably the completion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Rubio has stumbled at times on this campaign. They had that disastrous robotic debate performance in New Hampshire, and recently was mocked for running an ad that included the Vancouver skyline. Ouch.
But all candidates and campaigns make mistakes. It's the good ones who overcome them, and they did that in South Carolina. Rubio gets our updated recommendation for the Texas primary.
Dave Hodges
The world is finally beginning to wake up to the global tyranny that is threatening all of humanity. In the past two months I have heard from people that I have not heard from or seen for 10-20 years. I have heard from former players, students, friends and neighbors.
Several people contacting out of my distant past may not sound significant, but I had zero expectation of hearing from any of these people again. And all of the contacts were motivated by their concern for the decimation of our Republic and my work towards reversing the trend curve.
Sometimes as I pound away at my keyboard in the middle of the night, I wonder if I am making a difference with regard to awakening the multitude of sheep in this country. Frequently, I have wondered if any of us are making a real difference. Yet, I have met so many gifted morally upstanding people in our Patriot movement. The majority of the people in the alternative media, too many to mention, have talent, charisma, intelligence, education, a love of God and country and are only motivated by the desire to live in a society which is governed by people who want to help their fellow man, not to enslave them.
I am very gratified to say that my personal barometer says that after a long battle, the journalists in the truthful media are beginning to reach a critical mass of influence.
In the classic book written by Malcom Gladwell, The Tipping Point, they postulate what it takes to get an idea to go viral. True to Gladwell's premises, we in the alternative media have dramatically increased our contact base and our subsequent reach.
Just Who Is the Alternative Media?
One does not have to maintain a website or host a talk show to have an effect in the war on corruption and tyranny. I have met several people on Facebook who share articles that they identify with and they send these articles to scores of people. Many of these same people will also write an accurate and succinct summary of world events in a paragraph or two, insert a clever picture, which serves to enhance the meaning, and then send it on. They, too, comprise the alternative media.
I am simply awestruck at the reach that we are acquiring in the alternative media. We are having a dramatic impact and the effect is incredible given the fact that we are demonized in the MSM and the globalists control 98% of the corporate media. And, yet, America is still waking up.
All of us, whether we write, broadcast, share on Facebook or simply educate our neighbors and friends, should all take a look in the mirror and pat ourselves on the back because we are being successful in the first step towards taking our country back, which is to awaken the sleeping masses.
How Does the Process of Awakening Work?
Scientists from the prestigious Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have determined that if just 10% of any given population holds to an unshakable idea, that the idea will become adopted by the majority of the country. However, the scientists who belong to the Social Cognitive Networks Academic Research Center (SCNARC) found that if the ideas are shared by less than 10% of the population, the idea will not progress and will eventually die out. The research was first published in a peer reviewed E Journal in an article titled “Social consensus through the influence of committed minorities.”
Computational and analytical methods were used to discover the tipping point where an obscure idea eventually becomes the majority opinion. The finding has dramatic implications for those of us trying to wake up the sheep in this country.
The SCNARC scientists found that the 10% figure was applicable whether they were talking about the spread of innovations or to advance a political ideal.
Our Friends Did Not Fund this Research
The research was funded by the Army Research Laboratory, with its obvious DARPA connections, through SCNARC. Additionally, the Army Research Office, and the Office of Naval Research contributed as well. SCNARC's corporate and academic partners consist of IBM, Northeastern University, and the City University of New York, as well as collaborators from Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, Northwestern University, the University of Notre Dame, the University of Maryland, and Indiana. As most of you will recognize, many of these organizations are fronts for globalist projects. Therefore, you can bet that the other side has a vested interest in limiting the number of sheeple that we are able to reach and convert.
Now does it make sense as to why the globalists are out to control the Internet? Why they seek to enact draconian legislation such as the NDAA and the PATRIOT Acts so they can create a matrix on who is being effective in the awakening of our country and then have a means to arrest the influential subversives who would oppose the emerging totalitarianism? It is obvious that the globalists seek to control the dialogue so that the critical mass of 10% is never reached. However, it is too late. The proof that the 10% threshold has been breached is apparent given the explosion of the alternative media and, unfortunately, there is one more factor to consider.
An Ominous Sign of Success
While most of us were still asleep, we would have been allowed by the globalists to lead lives of quiet desperation. However, as we awaken and seek to take action against the criminals who have hijacked our government in such scandals as Benghazi, the AP scandal and the abuse of power by the IRS, the globalists must take action. Simply put, our new-found awareness is becoming problematic for the globalist plans for world government and the unfolding of eugenics programs designed to dramatically reduce the population.
The globalists know that we are an incident away from running down every one of them so that we can get our hands on them and then subsequently hang them from the light poles on Wall Street. Why do you think that 30% of Congress has announced they are not seeking re-election? They are frightened and they know what is coming and so does DHS. Oh yeah, you say, as you suddenly remember that DHS has purchased 2.2 billion rounds of ammunition and 2,700 armored personnel carriers. DHS is declaring war on the American people and, in particular, they are going to go after veterans, Christians, gun owners, Libertarians, Constitutionalists and former supporters of Ron Paul.
Success Comes With a Price
Our new-found awareness comes with a price tag. You, I, and anyone who reads these types of articles are a threat to the establishment and must be dealt with. Assassination is no longer a widespread option for the globalists, as there are too many of us. To deal with what could evolve into an awakening monster, the globalists are meeting in secret this weekend in order to decide how to deal with us.
I think prudent people would be asking why the G-7 nations have called a highly unusual emergency meeting this weekend outside of London. This was unscheduled and can only be considered as an emergency meeting.
Bank Holiday or Worse?
Is a “bank holiday” coming in our immediate future which would likely be preceded by a false flag event in which martial law is rolled out? I know, I know, that this is only the talk of a conspiracy theorist. However, I have always maintained that a revaluation of assets and currencies would eventually take place. The globalists forced down the price of gold by manipulating the market and bought as much gold as they could at the depressed price. Why would a rich person buy as much gold as they could? Of course, they are seeking to convert their soon-to-be worthless cash into gold preceding the coming calamity.
Additionally, I have happened across some information which is suggestive of the fact that globalists are going to be collecting much more than gold, they will soon be collecting people. More on that and other issues as well in part two.

Image caption The floods have swept through a number of towns and villages in Uttarakhand
An unusually intensive fusion of two weather systems from opposite directions triggered this week's devastating floods in northern India and western Nepal, authorities have said.
They say the monsoon advancing towards the west of South Asia combined with westerly winds for an unusually long time and with an extraordinary intensity, which resulted in days of torrential rains.
Weather authorities in India and Pakistan have warned there is still a threat that the dangerous combination will cause more devastating floods.
At least 560 people are known to have been killed and thousands are missing in northern India. The death toll is expected to rise further.
The worst-affected areas are in India's Uttarakhand state, where floods have flattened homes and swept away roads and bridges.
Is this intensity of interaction and resulting rainfall in any way linked to global warming? Professor Bill Hare
More than 40,000 people, many of them Hindu pilgrims, are still stranded in what the government has described as a "national crisis."
Single phenomenon?
"Such interaction (between the two weather systems) does happen at times during this season but the intensity this time and the duration is something we have not seen for quite some time," BP Yadav, director at the Indian Meteorological Department, told the BBC.
The interaction lasted three days they said, the first such event for many years.
In Pakistan, experts said the westerly weather system arrived unexpectedly and had covered almost all of the country.
Qamar Zaman Chaudry, former director general of Pakistan's Meteorological Department, said this was highly unusual at this time of the year - the first occasion in 26 years.
They said May and June normally represented the dry season in Pakistan, with monsoon rains from July to September.
Image caption More than 33,000 have been rescued over the past several days
"The westerly weather system should be here only between October and April, but - quite bizarrely - we are seeing it at this time of the year and all over the country: from the Himalayan mountains to the coastal zones."
Mr Chaudry said the cause was unknown, adding: "It is difficult for us to link this single phenomenon to climate change."
But they added: "When we look at the abrupt changes in the climate and weather patterns in our country during the last 10 to 15 years, it becomes easy to link this to the changes taking place around the globe."
Bill Hare, visiting professor at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, agreed that it was an intensive interaction between monsoon and westerly winds that resulted into the torrential rainfall.
"But the question is: is this intensity of interaction and resulting rainfall in any way linked to global warming?
"In this specific event, we simply don't know but what we do know with a high degree of confidence is that these kinds of events, as a general statement, will be occurring more often in the future and will be more damaging as the globe warms.
"I think that's a fairly solid analysis from the physical science community," Prof Hare said.
The Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change, in its fourth assessment report, says that it "is likely that warming associated with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations will cause an increase of Asian summer monsoon precipitation variability".
"Changes in the monsoon mean duration and strength depend on the details of the greenhouse gases emission scenario."
Debates continue on whether global warming has any role on the changing rainfall patterns around the world, but soot and urban smog pollution have also been blamed for disrupting the south Asian monsoon.
A report by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organisation in 2011 said: "They disturb tropical rainfall and regional circulation patterns such as the Asian monsoon, affecting the livelihoods of millions of people.
"They can change wind patterns by affecting the regional temperature contrasts that drive the winds, influencing where rain and snow fall."
Experts, however, say not much is known about why westerly winds reach the South Asian region when they are not supposed to.
"That is still an area which is still pretty unclear scientifically," says Prof Hare.
"But anything that brings a lot of moisture into the region and interacts with the convective energy of the monsoon will probably contribute to more extreme rainfall events."
It is always inconvenient when a passenger dies on an aeroplane - not least for the person sitting in the next seat. So Singapore Airlines has attempted to take the trauma out of such tragedies by introducing a special cupboard to store any unexpected corpse.
The airline's new fleet of Airbus A340-500 aircraft boasts a discreet locker next to one of the plane's exit doors which is long enough to store an average-sized body, with special straps to prevent any movement during a bumpy landing.
Cabin crew have been instructed to use the locker in the event of a death on a long-haul flight - particularly if the aircraft is busy, with no free seats on which to lay out the deceased.
The aircraft came into use in February, operating the longest non-stop route in the world: a 17-hour, 7,900-mile journey between Singapore and Los Angeles.
The length of the flight has forced Singapore Airlines to think carefully about its handling of any medical emergencies - particularly because the route spans the Pacific Ocean, with little opportunity for an unscheduled landing.
An airline spokesperson said: "On the rare occasion when a passenger passes away during a flight the crew do all that is possible to manage the situation with sensitivity and respect.
"Unfortunately given the space constraints in an aircraft cabin, it is not always possible to find a row of seats where the deceased passenger can be placed and covered in a dignified manner, although this is always the preferred option.
"The compartment will be used only if no suitable space can be found elsewhere in the cabin."
The airline intends to begin a second route next month using the same long-range aircraft - the flight between Singapore and New York will skirt the North Pole, offering equally little scope for diversion.
Richard Maslen, the assistant editor of Airliner World magazine, said the compartment was an interesting feature of the new aircraft, which seats 180 people.
"As far as I'm aware, this is not something that's been thought of in other aircraft designs in the past," they said.
"Obviously, these things do unfortunately happen in the air and it's good to see that they have been thought about in advance."

A black-and-gold sign near an elevator directs visitors to meeting rooms with names like the Regent, the Wellington and the Kensington. Then you notice that there are no children around, and hardly any women. The hotel is used as a men's shelter, the city having run out of space in its shelter system. Hotels are not set up for this purpose; they are often far from a subway, and basic shelter services like laundry are lacking. One roommate at the Garden stole Mr. Roberson-Charles's laptop, they said, and another took things from their pockets. The pickpocket claimed to have killed someone. Mr. Roberson-Charles did not press the issue. They stayed there about a year, during which time they got a job doing phone surveys. They hated it. They were berated and hung up on, but it was work. They kept applying for other jobs. No one even called them back. They realized then that they needed college credentials, and LaGuardia was right across the street from the survey company. They enrolled for the fall semester.

At the end of August, we did a follow-up article on what we believe is a far bigger marginal driver to the price of oil than OPEC production (which may or may not be reduced by up to 750kbpd in November), namely the Strategic Petroleum Reserve of China, a major importer of oil in recent years, along with India, taking advantage of low prices and largely supporting global oil demand growth at a time of rampant oversupply, and which we profiled most recently in "A Chinese "Mystery" Has Become The Biggest Wildcard For The Price Of Oil."
The simplest reason why Chiina's SPR capacity (and storage) is of key importance, is that it determines the ongoing demand China has for oil - of which many ends up in storage - and also allows analysts to calculate how much more oil China would need, in order to fill up its SPR. While China has traditionally kept any data about its SPR inventory as opaque as possible, in a rare release this month, Beijing reported adding about 43 million barrels of crude to its strategic reserves between mid-2015 and early this year. Reserves totaled 31.97 million tons in early 2016, equivalent to about 234 million barrels, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement that was the first government update on reserves since December.
A guard stands before the oil SPR tanks at Zhoushan
As Bloomberg confirmed, emergency stockpiles of the second-biggest oil user have been a source of speculation among analysts and traders, who rely on customs figures and infrequent construction updates to estimate how much of the country's imports go into strategic inventories, and for how long they will continue to fill.
A few days ago, S&P discussed the critical topic of Chinese reserves, when earlier this week, Jodie Gunzberg, global head of commodities at S&P Dow Jones said at a S&P Global briefing on oil markets in London that "regardless of what happens on the supply side, there's this wildcard factor of the strategic petroleum reserves." Oddly, they used our precisely wording.
As they further explained, "now that China has bought so much cheap oil to fill their SPR, which nobody really knows how much there is (in it), if OPEC does freeze and tries to bring the price back up, China may push it back down because they might choose not to buy it at a higher price and just choose to use their SPR or start exporting it themselves - like they did with other commodities."
"So I feel that that is, right now, more of a factor influencing how long the low oil prices might stick around," Gunzberg added.
Not only that but as JPM estimated earlier in the year, the closer China gets to filling its Chinese SPR, logically the less its import demand for crude will be, and as a reminder, JPM speculated that we are now approaching a period when - according to the bank's calculations - Chinese SPR will proceed to rapidly wane, effectively offsetting any supply reduction by OPEC. As we reported in June, JPM estimated the country built up a total of about 400 million barrels by mid-2016 out of a targeted 511 million barrels.
Perhaps the reason why JPM's concerns that China was approaching its SPR capacity dissipated, is that when China revealed its far lower number in SPR storage earlier in September, it telegraphed that it has much more "pent up demand."
However, in retrospect it appears China may have been lying, again.
According to satellite images by geospatial analytics startup Orbital Insight, China, has not only misrepresented how much oil it has stored, it has done so at a massive scale, with the real number dwarfing even JPM own estimate: the real amount of Chinese oil in storage, according to Orbital, was a whopping 600 million barrels as of May. Assuming JPM's estimated rate of SPR accumulation of about 1mmbpd, the 600 million number than of May would have grown to well over 700 million barrels as of September.
Orbital's figure as first reported by Bloomberg, is well over two times larger than China's official estimates for strategic petroleum reserves and for commercial stocks, said Orbital Chief Executive Officer James Crawford.
There were about 2,100 strategic and commercial petroleum reserve tanks capable of storing 900 million barrels as of the end of 2014, according to calculations derived from photos tracking the depth of shadows visible on top of the floating lids of the giant tanks. They don't include underground caverns.
The company's estimates also exceed projections from forecasters including Energy Aspects Ltd., and help shed light on oil reserves that puzzle commodities traders worldwide. China's record purchases this year have helped oil prices recover from the worst crash in a generation.
Bloomberg also notes that "the findings are also the latest example of how private technology firms are using big data and machine learning to better measure the second-largest economy, where some official data are incomplete and private gauges have vanished without explanation." That is a polite way of actually getting some data out of China that isn't totally made up.
So why are China's vastly greater than admitted SPR holdings important, especially in the aftermath of the OPEC "deal"? As Dave Ernsberger, global head of oil content at S&P Global Platts, told the S&P briefing, China's SPR is a challenge for markets. "The SPR in China is one of a number of unknown factors that mean you can never get too comfortable assuming any set of circumstances in the global oil markets."
They said the exact size of China's SPR was unknown, however, making it a risk that was hard to quantify.
"It never suits any buyer, or bulk buyer, to flag to the market how much they want to buy so we're likely to get a lot of misinformation around that for quite some time to come. SPRs are strategic, as the name suggests, so the government isn't going to talk about it."
Which explains why China has been so eager to keep its true SPR holdings secret or simply misrepresent them.
Furthermore, while China might have millions of barrels of oil stockpiled for either its own emergency use or to sell, demand growth from the country is ebbing. The IEA warned this month that "recent pillars of demand growth China and India are wobbling." S&P Global Platts' Ernsberger, cited by CNBC, said that the slowdown in Chinese demand was worrying for major oil producers.
"The demand picture is very unsettling for OPEC and for all producers of crude and refined products (and this is seen most significantly in) the slowdown in growth in the Chinese market. China has returned more incremental demand for the oil market in the last five years than any other country in the world and more than almost any of the counties combine. But this year demand growth in China has stalled and that represents a significant change in the environment for producers both in OPEC and outside it."
"The successors to China who will pick up the slack in demand growth aren't quite of a size yet to have the impact that Chinese growth has had. So the demand picture is fairly frightening from a producers' point of view."
Which, much more than anything, is why OPEC was "willing" to reach a production cut (non) deal: it is aware that its until recently the fastest growing client is about to slam the brakes, and the only option for Saudi Arabia and its minions was to produce less ahead of this inflection point. That said, with both supply and demand declining, the overall impact on price will be virtually nil, unless of course price does go up, in which case US shale production is about to go into major overdrive.
And speaking of shale, US producers are already scrambling to take advantage of the recent price spike: as Bloomberg reported moments ago, OPEC is “is throwing a lifeline” to U.S. shale oil producers who have sought to hedge production due to the price rise spurred by the group's deal Wednesday to cut output, BNP Paribas head of commodity strategy Harry Tchilinguirian said by phone. “What this OPEC meeting has done is actually throw a lifeline to producers, and in particular U.S. shale oil, that as a result of the spot move and the move in the rest of the curve have come in in droves to hedge production,” Tchilinguirian said.
Tchilinguirian says BNP has "seen many queries coming through as a result of the OPEC decision” which has lifted the WTI curve “to levels acceptable where U.S. producers can hedge."
Which is good news for shale and gas consumers, and bad news for Saudi Arabia. OPEC, the petrodollar and risk assets.
Real Madrid Calls for the introduction of VAR
Ancelotti wants James
Real Madrid will take on Juventus in this season's Champions League final, but Carlo Ancelotti is still upset that they made it past their Bayern Munich side in the quarter-finals given that the second leg was marred with controversy.
The Italian coach believes there is a need to introduce video technology to avoid such refereeing errors.
"It was an injustice," they said of the Bundesliga champions' European elimination in an interview with Corriere.
"It will go down in history that Real Madrid eliminated Bayern Munich, but the world saw what happened in Madrid.
"It was not normal and there's a need to introduce VAR."
Looking to the future, Ancelotti discussed the fact that two of their former teams are facing each other, but said they had no particular preference, even if he'd love to see Gianluigi Buffon win it for the first time.
"I will watch the final with interest, supporting whoever plays better," they said.
"For me, Juventus is essentially Buffon, who was one of my players.
"This victory would crown an astronomical career."
Also discussed in the interview was the decision Zinedine Zidane has to make up front and Ancelotti explained the logic behind Alvaro Morata's place on the bench.
"That's because [Karim]Benzema is the best player to play with [Cristiano] Ronaldo," they pointed out, while also dismissing the notion that Los Blancos are too reliant on their No.7.
"They also have [Luka] Modric, [Sergio] Ramos, Marcelo, Benzema and others.
"I got on really well with the players and perhaps I paid the price for that."
Finally, Ancelotti said they were not surprised by the success their former apprentice Zidane is enjoying, labelling them an intelligent coach.

DECATUR, Ala. (WHNT) - Decatur Police responded to a report of a body in the Wilson Morgan Park pavilion near Adventureland around 9 a.m. Saturday.
Police say the victim, a man, had been shot in the head. According to police, evidence at the scene suggests it may be related to a string of other violent incidents in the overnight hours.
Police say that series of events started at 9 p.m. with reports of shots fired on 5th Avenue. No one was hit, but the shots reportedly came from a silver Nissan Altima with a few people inside.
Just before 10 p.m. police were called to a shooting on Albert Street. Officers found the body of a man in the car port of the house with what appeared to be multiple gunshot wounds. They're not identifying the victim yet.
Then just before 11:30 p.m. police responded to a call on 8th Avenue, where a woman says two men jumped out of a light-colored Nissan Altima and tried to rob them with a gun. They say they threatened to kill them in front of their 5-year-old daughter. They gave them their purse, and the two men escaped in the Altima.
Just after 12:30 a.m. officers were called back to 5th Avenue, where a woman says they heard multiple gunshots. Officers found bullet holes in the side of a house. The woman told police they saw a silver Nissan Altima with a black bumper driving away quickly.
Then around 1:15 a.m. a man came into the police station to tell them he'd been robbed by two men with guns in the area of 11th Avenue and 2nd Street.
Decatur Police now want your help. They're looking for a older model bronze or silver Nissan Altima with a dark colored bumper. If you have any information, they ask you call them at (256) 476-7638.

The wait is almost over and it will be over soon. Grab your pitchfork, machete or whatever, and prepare for Gun Media's “Friday the 13th: The Game” on May 26th, 2017!
The game will launch on Xbox One, PS4 and Steam as a digital download for $40USD, which means most of us should have no excuse to be playing together release week.
This is a huge deal because “Friday the 13th: The Game” remains canon, so much so that there's even a special version of Jason Voorhees, created by Tom Savini, designed to continue the story after Jason went to Hell.
For the purists out there, Kane Hodder performed the motion capture for Jason, while the great Harry Manfredini provided the music! For the first time since 1989, you have the opportunity to finally be Jason Voorhees; stalk camp counselors across Crystal Lake as Jason, or assume the role of a helpless camper and attempt to survive the night.
Oh, and there's a badass new trailer that shows the characters and wide variety of Jasons, as well as the kills, weapons, locations, and so much more.
Gun Media and developer Illfonic's “Friday the 13th: The Game”, initially announced as “Slasher Vol. 1: Summer Camp”, was funded through Kickstarter back in 2015.
[Related] Montage of Kills From the “Friday the 13th” Game!
In addition, the game's full multiplayer component includes Tommy Jarvis as a playable character. Movie setting Packanack Lodge will also be included in this release as a third playable map. This initial release will be followed by the full Summer 2017 release of the single-player component, including AI Bots.
The movie may be dead, yet…

Mazzoni Center Chief Executive Officer Nurit Shein resigned on Sunday after the board of directors asked for their resignation.
Board president Jimmy Ruiz also tendered their resignation.
The Mazzoni Center, an LGBTQ healthcare provider in Philadelphia, announced the leadership changes on Monday. They came just days after the board voted to stand behind both Shein and Ruiz.
Shein had headed the Mazzoni Center since 1995, but protesters recently began calling for their dismissal, alleging the Mazzoni Center has shown bias against minority employees under their watch.
The board initiated a search for an interim CEO and will later conduct a search for a permanent successor.
Dr. Tony Rodriguez was selected to serve as the interim board president.
A new executive committee includes Dr. Mark Blecher as vice president, Christopher Pope as secretary and Tony Verdi as treasurer.
The Mazzoni Center, located in the city's Gayborhood, said additional updates on the leadership transition will be provided as developments occur.
The resignations follow that of medical director Robert Winn, who stepped down on April 13.
Protesters from the Black and Brown Workers Collective have alleged that Shein knew of allegations of impropriety against Winn for years, but took no action.
The group's co-founder, Abdul-Aliy Muhammad, announced on Friday that they would discontinue taking their HIV medication until Shein resigned. Muhammad, who worked at the center until, 2016, said they protested "in solidarity with the victims of Robert Winn."
As CEO, Shein oversaw the Mazzoni Center's operations and departments in primary health care, mental and behavioral health and LGBT legal services.
Prior to their work at the Mazzoni Center, Shein was the director of programs for the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center. A native of Israel, they previously served as a career officer in the Israeli Army.
City Councilwoman Helen Gym said the changes represent "a necessary step" in rebuilding trust between the Mazzoni Center and the diverse communities it serves. They praised the current and former staffers who demanded accountability.
"They exemplify the Center's core, radical mission: to provide high quality, human-centered medical services to some of our city's most marginalized citizens," Gym said in a statement. "I thank them for their work."
On Friday, Gym had sent the Mazzoni Center board a letter requesting information about its investigation into the allegations raised by the protesters.
The city's Office of LGBT Affairs and the Mayor's Commission on LGBT Affairs released a joint statement calling for "increased transparency and accountability" throughout the investigation.
Medical standards and ethics, as well as the ethical expectations of the community, must be upheld to ensure the protection of Mazzoni center staff and patients, the statement said.
"The Office of LGBT Affairs and Mayor's Commission on LGBT Affairs strongly emphasize the need to critically address these issues in a timely manner to support our ability to heal, rebuild and move forward as a unified community," the statement said.
In January, the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations released a report on racism in the Gayborhood. It recommended that members of the Mazzoni Center receive voluntary training on the city's Fair Practices Ordinance and implicit bias.
In testimony collected by the commission, Mazzoni Center workers voiced concerns about employment practices, employee compensation and the adequacy of services provided to LGBTQ people of color.
The commission deemed the agency's employee handbook and policies "inadequate or not properly implemented," leaving employees vulnerable to discrimination.
In recommending training, the report noted that many employees did not file claims with the Human Relations Commission because they were unaware of the city's Fair Practice laws or feared retaliation.

History
The Boohbahs came about through a mysterious cause. In 2004, they made a TV show called Boohbah, which was actually mind-control propaganda disguised as a children's show. The show was produced by Ragdoll, who had made a normal children's show called Teletubbies, and aired on PBS until 2006.
In 2011, the Boohbahs invaded Japan. They killed the Dark Lord Madeline Schroeder and were going to destroy SEGA. However, Danielle Wurtz traveled back in time to 2004 and killed the Boohbahs before they made their TV show. Then they went to 1991 and killed Madeline Schroeder, thus making the Sonic series a bit different. They made other changes too, causing the Mobius Redrawn universe to be created. Then after a reality warp, a nuclear winter happened, which caused the Mobius Redrawn universe to merge into reality.
This week we learned the sad news that Ryan Gosling narrowly missed out on becoming a member of nineties baggy-pants warblers, Backstreet Boys.
Band member AJ McLean revealed that they asked their former neighbour Gosling to join the band but they turned them down. Later the Drive star changed their mind, only for McLean to never return their call. Gosling will just have to make do with being one of the most in-demand, desired and respected actors in Hollywood.
And he's not the only A-lister who missed out on a lifetime of stool-seat crooning; Colin Farrell auditioned unsuccessfully for Boyzone . But this sort of rejection can leave a sting. “You can't live in the past,” Gosling told a reporter when asked about their misfortune.

“That ship has sailed.”
(CNN) The knock was faint. But, alerted by their two dachshunds, Larry Wilkins went to their door and opened it to see a young girl -- their lips quivering, their nose bloodied, their arms and legs scratched up.
And, somehow, still alive.
"She told me that their mom and dad were dead," Wilkins said of the girl, Sailor Gutzler. "And that they had been in a plane crash."
The girl's sister and cousin also died when their Piper PA-34 aircraft went down Friday evening in western Kentucky. Even with the plane upside down, the 7-year-old made it out and trekked three-quarters of a mile in the dark through what Wilkins described as "very, very rough territory," mired with fallen trees, creeks, ditches and blackberry briars.
Sailor was barefoot except for one sock and was dressed for Florida -- shorts, no coat -- not for slogging through the January cold of Kentucky. Wilkins got them on their couch and called 911, alerting authorities that a plane had gone down and there was at least one survivor.
Kentucky State Police troopers arrived in about 10 minutes. Sgt. Dean Patterson said the girl was taken to a local hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening.
"She's a terribly brave little girl, I'll tell you that," Wilkins said. "I can't imagine a 7-year-old doing that."
FAA: Pilot reported engine problems
The plane Sailor was on had left the warm, sunny climes of Key West, Florida, earlier Friday, heading for Mount Vernon, Illinois, a city roughly 80 miles east of St. Louis.
Until something went wrong. Federal Aviation Administration spokesperson Kathleen Bergen explained that air traffic controllers "lost contact with a Piper PA-34 aircraft ... shortly after the pilot reported engine problems and (said) that they were diverting to the Kentucky Dam State (Park) Airport."
The twin-engine aircraft didn't make it, crashing in Lyon County, about 30 miles east of Paducah, and less than 10 miles from the airport.
Two National Transportation Safety Board members left Washington late Saturday morning for Kentucky, agency spokesperson Keith Holloway said. They will join FAA investigators there to try to find out what caused the crash.
Kentucky State Police identified the dead early Saturday as Marty Gutzler, 48; Kimberly Gutzler, 46; and 9-year-old Piper Gutzler -- a husband, wife and their daughter. Also killed was 14-year-old Sierra Wilder, the survivor's cousin. All were from Nashville, Illinois, a community of just over 3,000 people.

Lt. Brent White told CNN affiliate KFVS that first responders "worked tirelessly to find this wreckage and hopefully salvage the lives of those that were on board."
"But, ultimately, it just wasn't meant to be."
Their bodies were removed and the plane was covered early Saturday morning, Lyon County Judge Executive Wade White said.
Patterson, with the state police, said that members of the NTSB were expected to arrive later in the day. Inclement weather was hampering the investigation, they said in a statement. "Officials have indicated a minimum of two days to conduct an investigation at the scene," they said.
Marty Gutzler's Facebook page showed photos of their smiling daughters, political posts and their family sitting in a small plane with them at the controls. The latest one is of them and their wife celebrating New Year's Eve at a Key West resort.
The Rev. Matthew Wietfeldt of Nashville's Trinity Lutheran Church said those killed -- whom he's known for four years -- "will be deeply missed."
"The Gutzlers were a wonderful family and wonderful members of our congregation and community," Wietfeldt said.
Kent Plotner, an attorney representing the family, said in a statement, "The Gutzler family mourns the loss of Marty, Kim and Piper Gutzler and Sierra Wilder. We are devastated by this loss, but are confident that they rest in God's loving arms. We ask that you respect our privacy at this difficult time. Please pray for us, especially for Sailor Gutzler."
A fund has been set up "for the benefit of Sailor Gutzler," at sailorgutzlerfund.com , Plotner said.
"The family thanks you for the heartfelt words of sympathy that have been expressed during this unimaginable loss," they added.
Police: 'It's just really a miracle'
How the youngest person on the plane managed to emerge alive also hit close to home for many like Trooper White, who has an 8-year-old girl of their own.
"When I saw ... what appeared to be a 7-year-old child that had walked through this dense forest and through some really tough terrain and some awfully poor conditions tonight and survived this," they said, "it's just really a miracle."
Wilkins says they believe Sailor saw their street lights through the woods and, thankfully, found them -- in one of only three homes in their neighborhood that are occupied in winter. White, the Lyon County executive, said the fact they went that way "saved their lives."
"Any other direction could have ended badly with the cold weather," they said.
Sailor was released from Lourdes Hospital in Paducah just after 1 a.m. Saturday, state police said.
Thinking about what the 7-year-old went through and what comes next brings tears to Wilkins' eyes, they said.
"I just feel so sorry for that little girl, I can't understand it," Wilkins said. "I just can't imagine (going through) that, for someone that young."
The Ceuta border will be reinforced with 20 more civil guard officers, a helicopter and anti-climb mesh fencing in the next few weeks, Interior Minister Jorge Fernández Díaz announced at the end of their visit to the Spanish North African exclave on Wednesday.
The goal is to try to stem what the Spanish government has categorized as a “rising tide” of sub-Saharan migrants trying to reach Europe by jumping the border fences from Moroccan territory into the exclaves of Ceuta and Melilla.
But the minister was less precise about how Spain might strengthen the bilateral agreement on the policing of the frontier it signed in 1992 with Morocco, a country they referred to as a “neighbor, friend, partner and ally” on two occasions.
Asked about the possibility of legalizing on-the-spot handovers of immigrants who had made it into Spain back to Morocco – illegal under Spanish law - Fernández was clear to point out that such practices did not occur. They spent 20 minutes praising the work of the Civil Guard and their “distinguished behavior,” describing all criticisms of their actions as immoral.
They spent 20 minutes praising the work of the Civil Guard and their “distinguished behavior”
Spain's Popular Party (PP) government has come under heavy criticism from opposition parties and European officials over the actions of the Civil Guard on February 6, when 15 illegal immigrants died at a Ceuta border crossing after security forces fired rubber bullets.
During their over seven-hour visit to Ceuta, the minister held meetings with local organizations, but paid particular attention to supporting the work of the Civil Guard. They used the occasion to continually praise the level of cooperation with Morocco, greeting members of the Moroccan security forces at the border.
A meeting with the Moroccan authorities is scheduled for March 26 in Tangier with the aim of strengthening the bilateral agreement, particularly section 11, which points to the creation of a mixed Spanish-Moroccan committee for tackling the migrant issue, Fernández Díaz said.
But the minister said nothing explicit about what powers such a committee might have, despite the fact that in a meeting with their Moroccan counterpart on February 20 in Paris they alluded to “the immediate handing back of those who enter in a violent way or are caught in the act.”
The entire media world needs new revenue sources — including philanthropy — to finance coverage that is important but unprofitable.
Still, many of us chose journalism because we believed it to be a public good. I've seen journalists abroad risk their lives to get a story because they believed it important. If they can do that, maybe executive producers can occasionally risk ratings?
As early as March, Trump had received $1.9 billion in free media coverage, 190 times as much as they paid for. Back then, I called around to journalists and scholars, and there was already a widespread view that television had screwed up by handing Trump the microphone and failing to fact-check them adequately.
In addition, Trump was masterly at diverting us from substance. As Tom Rosenstiel, a veteran press critic, noted: “We need journalists to cover what is important, not bark at every car.”
It didn't help that the national media isn't very diverse — not just in racial or ethnic terms, but also socioeconomically and geographically. We don't have many national journalists with working-class or evangelical roots, so our coverage of Trump voters was often shallow or condescending, and we largely missed the fury and despair that Trump rode to victory.
We'll have to figure out new ways of doing things while focusing on journalism and not stenography. Jay Rosen of New York University suggests perhaps sending interns to cover White House briefings, and the veterans to dig up real stories.
We'll have to be persistent, continuing to press for the release of taxes and for policy details. We'll have to avoid the perils of false equivalence, quoting a person on each side as if there's a genuine debate when we know there isn't. And this may sound odd for a columnist to say, but we need more reporting, less pontificating.
We should also try harder to debunk fake stories. A false story on Facebook about President Obama banning the Pledge of Allegiance in schools had more than two million shares or other interactions, and a make-believe story about Pope Francis endorsing Trump had nearly one million such interactions.
John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is calling on Philip Hammond to hold an urgent public inquiry into whether Bank of England officials colluded in the rigging of the Libor rate.
The senior Labour politician said Hammond's silence on the issue was unacceptable after a BBC Panorama programme said it had evidence of pressure exerted by Threadneedle Street on the setting of Libor – the London interbank offered rate, which is the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans.
Libor is used as a reference point around the world for loans and mortgages and is set each day by a panel of leading banks, with each one submitting the rates at which it is willing to borrow.
Revelations that the rate was rigged at the height of the financial crisis have led to banks being fined hundreds of millions of pounds from a variety of regulators, while bankers from Barclays and UBS have been jailed.
In a letter to Hammond released over the weekend, McDonnell said new allegations potentially implicating the Bank of England “demand an immediate response from this government”.
“Continuing official silence from the chancellor is not acceptable when confronted with this scale of rigging,” they said. “It is essential that we clarify who took the decisions to rig the Libor index, and when, so that the schools, NHS hospitals and local councils that lost out can be paid the compensation that is rightfully due and public confidence in our banking system and official institutions can be restored.”
More recently, the Bank of England has found itself under the spotlight after new details emerged of bankers discussing Threadneedle Street's alleged involvement in the setting of Libor.
BBC1's Panorama programme said it had obtained a recording of a 2008 call between two bankers at Barclays in which the more senior person said the government and Bank of England were exerting pressure on it to lower the rate it offered for Libor.
The BBC said its investigations added to evidence that the Bank of England had put pressure on commercial banks to push their Libor rates down and that the transcript of the phone conversation at Barclays called into question evidence to the Treasury select committee given in 2012 by the former Barclays boss Bob Diamond and Paul Tucker, former deputy governor of the Bank of England.
In 2012, the former senior Barclays executive Jerry del Missier justified their decision to order their staff to manipulate interest rates in 2008 by saying they believed they were acting on the instruction of the central bank.
Del Missier told MPs on the Treasury select committee that they had issued the instruction after a conversation with their then boss, Diamond, in October 2008, when the financial system was on the brink. Diamond was then running Barclays Capital, the investment banking arm, before being promoted to chief executive.
Diamond resigned as chief executive of Barclays in the wake of the £290m fine received by the bank for attempting to manipulate Libor.
Tucker was also called before the committee to explain their dealings with Diamond. The MPs largely exonerated Tucker, but the release of a series of emails, including one in which they referred to Diamond as “an absolute brick”, raised questions about their cosy relationship with the City.
Responding to last week's Panorama report, the Bank of England said: “Libor and other global benchmarks were not regulated in the UK or elsewhere during the period in question.”
Yes, Bernie Sanders Would Have Defeated Trump
Michael Tracey Blocked Unblock Follow Nov 12, 2016
The reason Trump won the election is because the electorate shrunk in some sectors, but grew in others. The overall rate of turnout appears to have been 56.9% — this could fluctuate some as additional votes trickle in. As such, the rate of voter participation actually increased from 2012, when 54.9% turned out.
In what sectors of the electorate did turnout increase?
Places like Luzerne County, Pennsylvania:
And Philadelphia county:
And Staten Island:
and even Brooklyn!
By contrast, Trump's totals decreased in some traditionally Republican areas where their cultural stylings were less… appreciated. Such as Dallas:
And of course, Utah. (Mormons don't really like Trump)
Trump evidently had far greater appeal among a certain type of Republican-leaning voter—mostly irreligious, non-ideological, cultural conservatives—than Romney ever could have dreamed of garnering.
So why is this relevant to Sanders' theoretical prospects against Trump? Not because they would've siphoned away vast swaths of Trump voters — although that certainly would've happened in some measure — but because they would've animated segments of the electorate that simply declined to vote. How about ideological progressives? They're not an astoundingly huge cohort — maybe something like 6% of the electorate? But they still vote reliably for candidates they perceive as advancing their interests. They in large part did not see Hillary as likely to advance their interests. They campaigned in the general election principally as a friend to billionaires, military chieftains, and neoconservatives. This was always a tremendously stupid strategy, because in doing so they alienated more voters than they attracted. (In fact, that they chose such a strategy despite the obvious electoral downsides demonstrated that Hillary was a true, committed zealot — even if it cost them politically, she'd cater to discredited war hawks and decadent oligarchs, while shunning the populist Left.)
Sanders would've mobilized the youth vote and the ideological progressive vote to a far greater degree than Hillary ever could. At the very least this would have won them Wisconsin, which Trump took by a small margin due to dramatic increases in rural voter turnout.
Recall, Sanders performed extremely well among rural voters compared to Hillary in the Democratic primary. They won the Wisconsin primary by 14% points; you can be sure that a critical mass of those voters opted not to vote for Hillary, thus handing the state to Trump. (Obama also blew out Hillary in the 2008 Wisconsin primary.) Unsurprisingly, Sanders also won the Michigan primary (defying the polls, which called that race spectacularly wrong) and leveled a compelling economic message tailored to the economic anxieties of voters in that state. I have almost zero doubt that propelled by increased turnout among youth, rural, and progressive voters, Sanders would have won both Michigan and Wisconsin.
Of course, these are counter-factuals and can't ever be proven or disproven. But there were so many lies told about Hillary's supposed “electability” that all of that should be thrown out the window. Foremost among the lies was Hillary's alleged strength among black voters. What a total deception. Black voter turnout absolutely plummeted virtually everywhere in the country, including in Flint, Detroit, and Milwaukee, which allowed Trump to score narrow wins in MI and WI. I believe Sanders would have vastly outperformed Hillary among black voters, especially young black voters who spent the past 1.5 years hearing about how corrupt Hillary was, and who (rightly, in my view) determined that they were not worthy of their vote.
Sanders also would have outperformed Hillary among black voters for the same reasons they would've outperformed them among all voters: they were a corrupt, decadent, cold, militaristic avatar of a failed status quo who had no argument for their candidacy other than “TRUMP! BAD!!!!” — this despite seeking the presidency for literally 10 years. (Or maybe it's 40 years?)
Sanders would have outperformed Hillary because they were not under felony criminal investigation by the FBI between July 10, 2015 and July 5, 2016, and then again from October 28, 2016 to November 6, 2016. That's not a problem that Sanders would have had to worry about. Trump couldn't have called them “Crooked Bernie” because he's not really done anything crooked over the course of their career, while Hillary and Bill have done so much that its full scope can barely be chronicled.
Sanders also didn't have a multi-national, quasi-governmental “Foundation” in operation while they served as the nation's top diplomat. That's partly because Sanders never served as Secretary of State, and partly because they they probably would never have engaged in such fraudulent, rapacious activity.
In my travels across Pennsylvania, Ohio, and North Carolina over the past few weeks, I'm not exaggerating when I say that I didn't meet a single person under 30 who could be described as “enthusiastic” about Hillary. Screaming “TRUMP BAD! BAD BAD BAD!” just isn't enough to turn out those voters. They need an affirmative program. Sanders had just that. They would've been seen as a clean break from the status quo despite running on the Democratic ticket. They would've been seen as a friend to Obama while improving on their legacy, which would've appealed to some black voters. They would've been a “change agent.” Because Hillary is so egotistical and arrogant, they decided to run knowing full well that “change agent” would be the absolute last thing on voters' minds when they assessed their candidacy. So instead, Trump was permitted to usurp that role. And it worked.
In sum, here are the states and localities that I think Sanders would have definitely won convincingly against Trump, which Hillary either lost or barely won:
Michigan
Wisconsin
New Hampshire
Minnesota
Maine's second congressional district
Colorado
I think Sanders would have probably won the following states:
Pennsylvania
The following states would've been a little tougher, but Sanders would've been competitive and maybe even lightly favored:
Nevada
North Carolina
Virginia
Florida
That would've been enough. We can never say with any certainty because of the counter-factual problem, but I'm highly confident that Sanders would have defeated Trump. Remember, they consistently got more popular over the course of the Democratic primary contest as more voters became acquainted with him, while Hillary became increasingly less popular as they received sustained exposure.  They are an unappealing person in every way, and voters didn't like what they saw.
Sanders also would have had an incredible “ground game,” comprised of the full breadth of the progressive movement's activist base — a highly organized set who would've spent months registering voters, and then got them out to the polls. “Online Activism” on Sanders' behalf would've been dominant, whereas Trump somehow prevailed in that category versus Hillary. Because progressive activists were so dispirited by the fixed and fraudulent Democratic primary process, they were demobilized. You can bet that they would've been incredibly mobilized for Bernie. (Hillary didn't even have a robust “ground game.” That was another lie. Trump's was more robust; their huge rallies allowed for massive swaths of data to be collected, which was then funneled into successful “Get Out the Vote” efforts. Remember Bernie's huge rallies? Yes, those mattered.)
Bernie would've won. Joe Biden would've probably won. Elizabeth Warren would've probably won. Hell, even Martin O'Malley would've probably won. The reason Hillary lost was because they were a remarkably weak candidate whom the Democratic establishment insisted on nominating anyhow, despite being keenly cognizant of their severe flaws. Those who enabled them deserve permanent censure for the decision. They must face consequences.
Photographer David Eger's first project, 365 Days of Clones, featured daily photos of Clone Troopers acting out hilarious antics. Eger's newest project, titled 52 Weeks of Star Wars, features a weekly Star Wars mashup. I've selected 29 of the best, in as highres as I could find them. The level of detail that Eger has put into each is really amazing.
In an interview with Wired, Eger reveals a bit about their process:
Almost all the pictures are staged in their basement studio using the 500 or so Star Wars figurines he's collected since they were a kid. They have toys from the original release, a re-release in the 1990s as well as contemporary figures. The original toys are valuable as collector's items but Eger prefers the newer ones for photos because their articulation points can be wrangled into more creative positions.
Make sure to check out the full 52 Mashups and 365 Days of Clones.
The president elect took questions from a room packed full of reporters laying out how they plan to ‘Make America Great Again'. But rather than their unusual rhetoric taking centre stage it was the strategic placement of what looked like a 'No Entry' sign on the podium which captured attention online. The White House which appeared to be placed in a red circle immediately captured the attention of eagle-eyed Twitter users who believe that Mr Trump was using subliminal messaging in relation to their tough stance on immigration.
CNN Mr Trump looked like they were standing in front of a No Entry sign
Fitting that there appear to be a 'No Entry' sign in front of the cheeky chappy Sanjeev Bhaskar
The 70 year-old has made no secret of their plans to start immediate deportations as soon as they take office. And their strategically placed sign immediately provoked a reaction to those who believe they are planning to shut America's borders. Sanjeev Bhaskar said: "Trump press conference. Fitting that there appear to be a 'No Entry' sign in front of the cheeky chappy.” While another said: "As @oliwelsh just pointed out, Trump's presidential seal looks like a No Entry sign. " Another added: "I like how Trump's made-up “Office of the President-Elect” logo looks like a No Entry sign."
GETTY Hundreds of people noticed the No Entry sign that was actually a picture of The White House
While another user said: "That 'No Entry' sign on the Trump administration podium is very VERY ominous... " Another said: "Why does #PEOTUS have a no entry sign on their podium #trump @realDonaldTrump" And user Jon said: "Listening to Trump talking about 'the wall' and their crest looks like a no entry sign. #irony" Emilia Flockhart said: "What's with the no entry sign on the podium? #cantunsee #whitehouse #trump #noentry."

The news comes after the Department of Homeland Security has seen a surge of undocumented illegal immigrants crossing the border from Mexico ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration. The town of McAllen, Texas has been inundated with activity in recent days as desperate families attempt to enter the United States before Mr Trump takes office. Billionaire Trump, 70, is planning to completely rework the US immigration system including a controversial policy that will see anyone illegally entering the country deported. The president elect has made no secret of their plans to curb US immigration and revealed a ten point plan during their election campaign. During a speech in Phoenix, Arizona, the president elect revealed they plan to completely rework current immigration policy which they claim costs US taxpayers £245 billion a year.
GETTY Many Twitter users wondered what the sign might mean
And as well as famously declaring that he's going to build a wall along the Mexican border they also pledged to triple the number of immigration staff as and end the current system of 'catch and release' where migrants await asylum claims being processed. The Humanitarian Respite Center at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in McAllen has seen record numbers over the past month. More than 7,500 immigrants were processed in November, up from 5,600 in October. Figures for December are yet to be announced however it is believed it was the busiest month since it opened in June 2014. Immigrant families face treacherous journeys from central America as they try to make a new life for themselves. And at least one person drowned crossing the Rio Grande river last week before being detained, processed and released by the U.S. Border Patrol. Hundreds of thousands of people are thought to have crossed the border illegally to request asylum from violence in their home countries. During their speech Mr Trump said that on the first day of their presidency they would "begin working on an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border".
GETTY Twitter users noticed the sign and immediately began speculating
And when unveiling their 10 point plan they declared they would: "End catch-and-release. Under a Trump administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country." Mr Trump is also planning to immediately deport anyone with a criminal record. They have previously declared that "Illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names". They also claimed "there are at least 2 million convicted criminal aliens now inside the country." And added that they planned to: "Move criminal aliens out day one, in joint operations with local, state, and federal law enforcement.

An internal USDA Greening Update newsletter that promotes “Meatless Mondays” caused a bit of an uproar on Wednesday.
The National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) sent out a news release linking to the newsletter and questioning USDA's commitment to the livestock industry. The newsletter talked about various “greening” initiatives by the agency and suggested that “one simple way to reduce our environmental impact while dining at our cafeteria is to participate in the “Meatless Monday” initiative.” But it didn't stop there:
The production of meat, especially beef (and dairy as well), has a large environmental impact. According to the U.N., animal agriculture is a major source of greenhouse gases and climate change. It also wastes resources. It takes 7,000 kg of grain to make 1,000 kg of beef. In addition, beef production requires a lot of water, fertilizer, fossil fuels, and pesticides. In addition there are many health concerns related to the excessive consumption of meat.
Within an hour after the NCBA release went out, USDA pulled the newsletter from the initial link and a statement was sent out by USDA press secretary Courtney Rowe. “Today, we have received a number of inquiries regarding a rumor that USDA is encouraging “Meatless Mondays,” they wrote, adding a statement from an unnamed USDA spokesperson that “USDA does not endorse Meatless Monday. The statement found on the USDA website was posted without proper clearance and it has been removed.”
The offending document was found on another link, and you can read the whole thing here where we uploaded it to our server. Just deleting the document from the link does not address this issue at all, since this is an internal newsletter that was sent to USDA employees. That makes this more than a “rumor.” While the Secretary may have been unaware of this gaffe and it may not be “official” USDA policy, the message has been sent to USDA employees that meat is bad for the environment. Not only does this have to be pulled, action should be taken against whoever wrote it and an immediate retraction should be made in a new “Greening Update.”
This is animal activism in a government agency that should be supporting all agriculture and it is unacceptable.
A Halifax woman's belief in Good Samaritans was reinforced Friday when a delivery truck driver escorted their visually impaired daughter through tall snowbanks and busy traffic on a crowded downtown street.
Carole Buchanan was driving their 41-year-old daughter Jenny Morash to an afternoon hair appointment on Argyle Street when a Sysco delivery truck ahead of them stopped in front of Neptune Theatre. Buchanan was boxed in on the one-way street with a delivery van to their right, snowbanks a few metres high to their left, and busy Sackville Street to their back.
"I was feeling quite stressed, actually," they said. "Next thing I know, as I'm backing up to see if I could get through it, this gentleman comes around the front of [my vehicle] with a safety vest on."
Driver could have just 'walked away'
The driver helped them get to a spot where it was safe for Morash to exit the vehicle. But because of the snow, Buchanan still couldn't get out.
The driver, having learned Morash is blind, asked if they could escort them to the sidewalk. Snow was piled high on the street and curbside after two powerful winter storms hit Atlantic Canada within the last week.
"He could have just helped us get out of the whole boxed-in situation and walked away and called it a day," said Morash, who called the driver's offer "heartwarming."
"He didn't grab my arm and try to tug me like Theodore Tugboat or anything. They offered me their arm and didn't move so slowly that they made me feel like an invalid, but didn't try to rush me through the snow."
Buchanan made a point to take pictures of the truck's identification numbers so the driver could be later identified by Sysco Canada. (Carole Buchanan/Facebook)
No response from company
While waiting for their daughter's hair appointment to finish, Buchanan snapped pictures of the truck and posted them on Sysco's Facebook page. It may not have been a life-or-death situation, but they nonetheless wants to sing the driver's praises to the company.
Buchanan said they haven't heard from the company, which markets and delivers food to restaurants, hospitals and other facilities.
"[I want] to try to thank them properly because I really I know so many people who do so many kind things for so many people, very rarely do you get the chance to really feel that someone has gone over and above a kind act," they said.
"I just wanted their company to know that they had such a good employee, driving those huge trucks in narrow streets packed with snow and being kind on top of it."
The European Parliament today passed a law that will put an end to mobile roaming fees by 2017. The law was approved as part of a larger legislative package that also sought to strengthen net neutrality protections across the European Union, but which failed to close major loopholes that could be exploited to create internet "fast lanes."
The ban on roaming charges enjoyed broad support within the European Parliament, and was widely expected to pass. Under the measure, it will be illegal for telecoms to charge roaming fees for calls, text messages, and data as of June 15th, 2017. Consumers will instead pay the same rates they would in their home countries. As of April 30th, 2016, roaming charges will be capped at €0.05 per minute for outgoing calls, €0.02 for texts, and €0.05 for every megabyte of data. A cap for incoming calls will be determined at a later date.
"long awaited by everybody."
"This abolition of roaming surcharges has been long awaited by everybody," said Pilar del Castillo, a Spanish member of parliament and rapporteur of today's debate. "Thanks to this agreement, Europe will also become the only region in world which legally guarantees open internet and net neutrality. The principle of net neutrality will be applied directly in the 28 member states. It also ensures that we will not have a two-speed internet." (That last part is very debatable.)
Others weren't as thrilled about the law. Commenting on their website, Julia Reda, MEP for the European Pirate Party, said that both the net neutrality law and the roaming charges ban failed to deliver on their promise. "The plan to place an end to roaming surcharges in Europe has been adopted pending a review of pricing and consumption patterns," Reda writes. "Even if the review is completed by the 15 June 2017 deadline, roaming surcharges will only be suspended up to a 'fair use' limit beyond which they still apply and continue to hinder the breaking down of barriers within Europe.”
The right to keep and bear arms is a vital element of the liberal order that our Founding Fathers handed down to us.
Armed citizens take responsibility for their own security, cultivating the self-reliance and vigorous spirit that are indispensable for genuine self-government.
As I argue in a new essay for The Heritage Foundation, the Founders understood that those who hold political power almost always will strive to reduce the freedom of those they rule and that many of the ruled always will be tempted to trade their liberty for empty promises of security. The causes of these political phenomena are sown in the nature of man.
The Constitution, including the Second Amendment, is a device designed to frustrate the domineering tendencies of the politically ambitious. The Second Amendment also plays an important role in fostering the kind of civic virtue that resists the cowardly urge to trade liberty for an illusion of safety.
Armed citizens take responsibility for their own security, thereby exhibiting and cultivating the self-reliance and vigorous spirit that ultimately are indispensable for genuine self-government.
While much has changed since the 18th century, for better and for worse, human nature has not changed. The fundamental principles of our regime and the understanding of human nature on which those principles are based can still be grasped today.
Once grasped, they can be defended. Such a defense, however, demands an appreciation of the right to arms that goes beyond the legalistic and narrowly political considerations that drive contemporary gun-control debates.
>>> Read the Essay: “The Right to Bear Arms and the American Philosophy of Freedom“
Regrettably, too many American opinion leaders, forgetting or rejecting the reasons that justify this right, have been extremely uncomfortable with the Second Amendment.
The progressive left, for example, largely has been united in promoting restrictions on civilian access to firearms. Lawyers as well, who Tocqueville famously thought could serve America as a kind of democratic aristocracy, have been hostile to gun rights.
Until 2008, federal judges—our most elite corps of attorneys—never once had sustained a Second Amendment challenge to a government regulation. State courts, for their part, generally had upheld gun regulations under legal tests that practically gave legislatures a blank check. And the organized bar has lobbied for decades in favor of more restrictive controls on firearms.
Although the U.S. Supreme Court finally rediscovered the Second Amendment, it so far has protected only a narrow right to keep a handgun in one's home, and it did that much only by a narrow 5-4 vote. Especially after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, there is little reason to expect that the court will adopt doctrines that offer robust protection for the right to keep and bear arms.
Conservative intellectuals have offered little resistance to conventional elite opinion. Few of these pundits raise their voices against infringements of the right of self-defense, which is the core principle on which our liberal republic was founded. Some, including George Will and Charles Krauthammer, even advocate repeal of the Second Amendment so that the citizenry can be disarmed.
The principal sources of discomfort with the Second Amendment are the authoritarian impulse that comes so naturally to those who wield political power (either directly or through their influence over officeholders) and the cowardice that such people seek to instill in those they rule.
As a crime-control measure, restricting access to weapons by law-abiding citizens has been a proven failure, for reasons with which our Founders were quite familiar. Support for such policies is a sign either of ignorance about their effects or of disregard for the principles on which our republic was founded.
Conservatives constantly and rightly complain about the erosion of individual liberty by bureaucratic government, about the enervating effects of the nanny state, and about the suffocating atmosphere of euphemisms and repressed resentment imposed by the political correctness police. Whatever else has contributed to the decay of America's republican spirit, forgetfulness or ignorance about the philosophy underlying our free institutions is among the least excusable failings that public intellectuals can display.
That philosophy was articulated by John Locke, William Blackstone, and every one of our Founding Fathers. If more pundits paid more attention to their views, fewer people would think that the right to arms is a product of romanticism about guns or an outmoded 18th-century mentality.
The American right to keep and bear arms, and its continuing value, reflect the reality of human nature and a reasoned response to that reality. The same cannot be said for the views of conservatives who would gut or even repeal the Second Amendment.

WASHINGTON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Senator John McCain lashed out at fellow Republican Ted Cruz on Wednesday over a Nazi appeasement comparison they made during their all-night, anti-Obamacare marathon on the U.S. Senate floor.
Speaking after Cruz had the floor for 21 hours and 19 minutes, McCain said they took umbrage at the Texas senator's efforts to pressure other Republicans to get behind their strategy for fighting President Barack Obama's signature health care law.
Cruz, a leader of the conservative Tea Party movement, has been urging their colleagues to join them in using the threat of a federal government shutdown to block funding for Obamacare.
McCain said they were particularly upset that Cruz had compared those unwilling to embrace their methods to British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and others who were willing to appease Nazi Germany before World War Two.
McCain, a Vietnam veteran and former prisoner of war, said the comparison was inappropriate. They said they had taken Cruz aside privately to tell him, and got a response they did not like: Cruz told them their appeaser reference applied not to distinguished members of the Senate but only media “pundits.”
“I resoundingly reject” Cruz's comments, said McCain, a senior Republican and former presidential candidate.
“I think it's wrong and I think it's a disservice to those who stood up and shouted at the top of their lungs that we cannot appease and that we must act,” they said.
They said the remarks were a disservice to those, including their father and grandfather, who fought in World War Two.
McCain also objected to the suggestion that Republicans who do not support Cruz's strategy were not fighting hard enough against the law, which most Republicans oppose. (Reporting By Caren Bohan; Editing by Fred Barbash and Doina Chiacu)
AMES, Iowa - Facing a narrowing primary contest, Hillary Clinton ripped into rival Bernie Sanders on Tuesday, saying the Vermont senator is offering unrealistic policies and overstating their anti-establishment credentials. For days, Clinton has cast Sanders as a less-forceful advocate for gun control, homing in on a 2005 vote they cast that gave immunity to gun manufacturers. On Tuesday, they broadened their critique, arguing that if Sanders wouldn't stand up to the National Rifle Association, they can't be trusted to take on other special interests.
AMES, Iowa � Facing a narrowing primary contest, Hillary Clinton ripped into rival Bernie Sanders on Tuesday, saying the Vermont senator is offering unrealistic policies and overstating their anti-establishment credentials.
For days, Clinton has cast Sanders as a less-forceful advocate for gun control, homing in on a 2005 vote they cast that gave immunity to gun manufacturers. On Tuesday, they broadened their critique, arguing that if Sanders wouldn�t stand up to the National Rifle Association, they can�t be trusted to take on other special interests.
�If you�re going to go around saying you stand up to special interests, then stand up to that most powerful special interest � stand up to the gun lobby,� they said as they accepted the backing of a major gun-control-advocacy group.
Clinton added: �Don�t talk to me about standing up to corporate interests and big powers. I�ve got the scars to show for it.�
The fresh critique marks an effort by Clinton to undermine the central argument of Sanders� campaign � that the Vermont senator is an outsider offering liberals a �political revolution.� At one point, they alluded to their mantra, telling supporters, �If that�s the kind of �revolution� he�s talking about, I�m worried, folks.�
With a touch of sarcasm, Clinton said President Barack Obama�s work to pass an overhaul to the nation�s health-care system was a major accomplishment and derided Sanders� plan for a single-payer Medicare-for-all system.
�I wish that we could elect a Democrat who could wave a magic wand and say, �We shall do this, and we shall do that.� That ain�t the real world we�re living in!� Clinton said.
Clinton also touted their foreign-policy credentials, drawing another, more implicit, contrast with Sanders, who has made tackling economic inequality the focus of their campaign. �I�m prepared to do all parts to the job,� they said.
Although Clinton has the backing of Democratic leaders and top donors, polls show a tighter race in Iowa, and Sanders has built a slight lead in New Hampshire. Losses in both states could raise worries among Democrats about their strength against Sanders, who was relatively unknown when they started the campaign but has attracted big crowds.
Clinton has long resisted directly targeting Sanders, fearing that such attacks would alienate their supporters. Should they win the nomination, Clinton will need that kind of liberal enthusiasm to boost them to victory in a general election.
Both candidates received endorsements. Clinton picked up the backing of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.
They were also endorsed by the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, a union of 1.3?a million members.
Sanders was endorsed by MoveOn.org, an organization at the forefront of liberal causes.
Jim Benning spent this summer a lot like they did their first two as general manager of the Vancouver Canucks, trying to walk the fine line between adding youth to an aging lineup without sacrificing its chances of getting back to the Stanley Cup Playoffs.
After the Canucks missed the playoffs for the second time in three seasons, they acquired 24-year-old defenseman Erik Gudbranson in a trade with the Florida Panthers and signed 31-year-old free agent forward Loui Eriksson to a six-year, $36 million contract. The second addition only cost the Canucks money, but much like a trade to acquire center Brandon Sutter from the Pittsburgh Penguins the summer before, Benning was questioned about the Gudbranson trade because it involved sending two draft picks and 20-year-old center Jared McCann to the Panthers.
Canucks 30 in 30: Top prospects | Fantasy outlook | Burning questions, reasons for optimism
Many wondered why a team that finished 28th in the NHL was trading picks and prospects instead of stockpiling them, especially with a general manager who was hired in large part for their draft expertise.
"I've had to move some draft picks in the last couple of years because I want the team to be competitive and I want our young players to grow up in a winning environment," Benning said. "That's been hard, moving those picks, but I think we are getting to a point now where unless it's a really good young player, we won't be moving any more picks."
Trading those picks was about filling in a generation gap in the roster, with an aging core anchored by Daniel Sedin and Henrik Sedin, who turn 36 before the season, and prospects Bo Horvat (21), Ben Hutton (23) and Jake Virtanen (19). Draft picks were traded away for Derek Dorsett, Linden Vey, Sven Baertschi and Philip Larsen, and in packages for Andrey Pedan, Emerson Etem, Brandon Prust, Sutter and Gudbranson.
"There was not a lot of turnover before I came because the team was very good, so we had a bunch of 32- to 34-year-old players and then the kids we were drafting," Benning said. "That's tough to win with consistently. You need that age group from 22 to 28, those are players I feel you can win with. Some of the moves we made are going to work out really nice and some other moves didn't work out, but that's what we had to try to do to fill in that age group."
Gudbranson fits that demographic, and is nine years younger than the defenseman they replace, Dan Hamhuis, who signed with the Dallas Stars as a free agent. Eriksson is outside that age group but four years younger than the player they replace, free agent Radim Vrbata.
Video: 30 in 30: Vancouver Canucks 2016-17 season preview
Gudbranson will be asked to help clear the crease and steady a defense that finished 23rd in the NHL giving up an average of 2.91 goals per game. Eriksson is a strong two-way forward but was added mostly to bolster the NHL's second-worst offense, with a 2.27 goals per game average that was better only than the New Jersey Devils (2.22).
"Gudbranson brings a physical presence to our back end, and leadership," Benning said, citing a deficit of each after trading Kevin Bieksa to the Anaheim Ducks last summer. "He was one of Florida's go-to guys in a matchup role and that's what we envision them doing for us."
Whether it's enough to get a team that ranked 27th in the NHL with a 47.2 5-on-5 shot-attempt percentage last season back to the playoffs remains to be seen, especially because Gudbranson's possession numbers (46.4 shot-attempt percentage) were worse, though likely affected by tough minutes starting in their zone against the opposition's top players.
A healthy Sutter should help after injuries limited them to 20 games last season. So could the additions of forward Anton Rodin, the Swedish League MVP last season, and defenseman Philip Larsen, who replaces free agent defenseman and power-play specialist Yannick Weber and should get an opportunity to play on the top unit after finishing fifth in scoring among Kontinental Hockey League defensemen with 11 goals and 36 points in 52 games for Jokerit last season.
Rodin, 25, and Larsen, 26, also fit the demographic Benning wants, but like Baertschi and Horvat, they will need to provide offense.
"We need to score more goals this year," Benning said, "And we have some young players that took a step last year and they are going to have to keep getting better for us this year."

A new survey says Obamacare's tax on medical device manufacturers forced companies to lay off or avoid hiring 33,000 workers last year — adding another arrow to the GOP's quiver as Republicans aim to portray the health care law as a job-killing program.
The report from the Advanced Medical Technology Association, or AdvaMed, underscored the latest line of attack against President Obama's signature law, as Republicans also trumpet the potential harm of the law's insurance rules on employers and a new report suggests government-subsidized health plans will prompt more than 2 million people to work less or leave the workforce.
The AdvaMed report said companies cut about 14,000 workers and decided not to hire about 19,000 workers because of the tax, which took effect in 2013.
According to the report, Obamacare's 2.3 percent excise tax on gross revenues prompted three-quarters of respondents to defer or cancel capital projects, trim investment in start-ups and reduce or defer raises for their employees.
“During a time when there is bipartisan support for growing high-technology manufacturing jobs, these results should serve as a wake-up call,” AdvaMed President and CEO Stephen J. Ubl said. “As a result of the medical device tax, we have seen an unprecedented impact on jobs and key investments in R&D. The findings of the report underscore the need to repeal this tax.”
A spokesperson for Sen. Orrin Hatch, Utah Republican and frequent critic of Obamacare, said the report “reconfirms what we've already known about the tax.”
The medical device tax is one of several taxes built into the Affordable Care Act to help pay for the reforms. But it has been attacked by both sides of the political aisle as a job killer that harms a growing business sector.
Senate Democrats, from states like Minnesota and Indiana, have been particularly vocal about their opposition, due to the large number of affected manufacturers in their states. The chamber voted 79-20 in March to repeal the tax, but it was part of budget talks and did not have the force of law.
Congress has not found the roughly $30 billion dollars needed to repeal the tax over the next 10 years. Lawmakers came close to scrapping the tax during the debate over federal spending and debt reduction in October, but those talks ultimately stalled.
Trade groups say they are just as passionate about eliminating the tax as they were last year, but critics of the repeal crowd say the outcry is much ado about nothing.
“Not only can the medical-device industry easily afford the tax without compromising innovation, but the industry's enormous profits are a result of anticompetitive practices that themselves drive up medical-device costs unnecessarily,” the New York Times editorial board said in October.
Ryan Ellis, director of tax policy for the Americans for Tax Reform, said in an interview last month that opponents of the tax seem to think they can repeal it by pressuring Senate Democrats alone. But even if enough Democrats join every Republican lawmaker in voting to repeal the tax, they said a broader strategy may be needed to get the measure to the Senate floor.
“This is a fairly regional issue,” Mr. Ellis said.

In Michel Fournier's case, crime really did not pay.
The former head of the corporation that maintains the Jacques Cartier and Champlain bridges pleaded guilty to accepting more than $2.3 million in bribes from SNC-Lavalin, the Montreal-based engineering firm, between 2001 and 2003. They were left with nothing to show for their crimes, besides a 66-month prison sentence.
Fournier, 65, a current resident of Victoria, B.C., pleaded guilty on Thursday to accepting bribes while they were a public official working in Montreal for the federal government and to laundering the money from those bribes between 2001 and 2009. According to a statement of facts read into the court record at the Montreal courthouse, Fournier went to great lengths to hide where the $2.3 million came from. But they lost $1.5 million through risky investments, and the federal government is now able to confiscate more than $775,000 seized during an RCMP investigation in 2016. From 1997 to 2004, Fournier was the president and director general of Federal Bridge Corp. and president of Jacques Cartier and Champlain Bridges Inc.
Quebec Court Judge Manlio Del Negro agreed with a joint recommendation that Fournier be sentenced to a five-and-a-half-year prison term, and they were handcuffed and taken into custody. They will probably be eligible for parole after they serve one-sixth of their sentence — 11 months — as their crimes were committed before 2011, when the federal Conservative government removed early parole eligibility from the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). Before the CCRA was amended, offenders serving federal sentences were eligible for early parole (after having served one-sixth of their sentence as opposed to one-third) if their crimes were non-violent and represented a first-time offence. In 2014, the Quebec Court of Appeal established that crimes committed before the change was made should be subject to the rules that applied at the time.
Fournier and their ex-wife, Judith Barkley Fournier, 65, were charged in June last year, following an RCMP investigation dubbed Project Agrafe. Prosecutor Louis-Philippe Meek Baillot informed Del Negro on Thursday that the charges against Barkley Fournier were being withdrawn.
Fournier admitted to receiving the bribes to award a $127-million contract in 2000 to a consortium led by SNC-Lavalin to replace the deck on the Jacques Cartier Bridge. The statement of facts read into the court record on Thursday leaves no doubt the bribes were paid by SNC-Lavalin.
“From Feb. 1, 2001, to Oct. 24, 2003, the evidence reveals that payments totalling $2,345,230 (Canadian) was paid by SNC-Lavalin to Michel Fournier in Swiss bank accounts,” the Crown said in the written statement.
No one from SNC-Lavalin has been charged in Project Agrafe and when Meek Baillot was asked why by reporters outside the courtroom, they said they would not comment on “hypothetical” situations. At least four different former SNC-Lavalin executives face criminal charges in five different pending criminal cases at the Montreal courthouse. That includes three former executives who were charged in a case involving the $1.3-billion contract to construct the McGill University Health Centre.
Fournier retired from their work in 2004 and, a few years later, apparently assumed it was safe to bring their bribe money back to Canada. To do this, they created an offshore shell company in the Virgin Islands.
“This company only existed to facilitate and conceal the monetary transfers from Switzerland to Canada, and it was dissolved after the (transfers) were finished,” the Crown noted in its statement. “The evidence also demonstrates that the Swiss funds were consolidated with a family inheritance received by the spouse of the accused, Judith Barkley Fournier.”
Meek Baillot said the Crown is no longer convinced “beyond a reasonable doubt” that Fournier's ex-wife committed a crime.
When Del Negro asked Fournier if they were pleading guilty to the charges of their own free will, they replied: “Yes, your honour, and I regret my actions.” They later told the judge that such a crime “should never be pardoned.” Fournier told De Negro that their annual salary during the period they accepted the bribes was $180,000.
“You had a job that anyone would dream of having. You had prestige and financial security,” Del Negro said before sentencing Fournier. “(Your salary put you) in the top half per cent of people in Canada. You were ready to retire at 55 when many people have to work beyond the age of 65.
“I find this sad.”

Yesterday, The Intercept published a blockbuster report, revealing that a major prison phone company may have been recording calls between prisoners and their attorneys. It was fascinating news, but just as interesting was where the information came from. It was based on tens of thousands of call records, which had arrived through The Intercept's SecureDrop server — a nested combination of Tor, PGP, and other tools designed to separate the leaker from anyone trying to expose him. In this case, it worked just the way it was supposed to: The Intercept got the documents and a way to communicate with its source, while the source stayed comfortably in the shadows.
It's the first major example of SecureDrop being used for its intended purpose, but what's interesting is how long it took. It's been two and a half years since publications first started setting up the system, and over the same period, public document dumps have become an almost commonplace part of the media. Leaked archives from Sony Pictures, Hacking Team, and Ashley Madison have established a new playbook for drawing media attention to incriminating or otherwise scandalous documents. It's a far messier playbook than the one SecureDrop laid out, fraught with all sorts of moral and journalistic hazards, but it's already threatening to overtake SecureDrop's more traditional notions of journalism.
There are serious drawbacks to torrent leaks, but they're all on the journalist's side
The new playbook is simpler than SecureDrop, beginning with an anonymous Pastebin statement, including a torrent link where any curious citizens can download the full data cache. It's a less secure way to leak things — P2P file transfers are notoriously difficult to disguise, even routed through a VPN — but so far the protection seems to have been enough, generally because the companies involved don't have the technical resources to follow up. The Sony leaks are the only incident to have been effectively traced back to its source, and that required the NSA's help. In practice, the Pastebin method offers roughly what they would have gotten from a system like SecureDrop — a simple way to make documents public and then disappear.
There are serious drawbacks to torrent leaks, but they're all on the journalist's side. They have less time to research, since the materials been made public to everyone at once, which may lead to inaccuracies or haphazard publication. There's also no way to talk to the leaker, a channel SecureDrop takes pains to include. That makes it difficult to verify where the documents came from and why they've been released. But while those are serious problems for anyone writing the story, they're arguably positive for someone releasing documents. There's no way to scrutinize their motives, and no concern that a publication will pass on a story it can't verify.
Leaks are shuffling off journalistic norms entirely
If you believe in classic investigative journalism, that's a depressing thought. Developed by free-software hero Aaron Swartz, SecureDrop was meant to fuse the anarchic, free-data ethos of Wikileaks with the classic investigative journalism of Watergate and the Pentagon Papers. Publications like The New Yorker, The Washington Post, and ProPublica rushed to adopt it as a best practice in the wake of the Snowden leaks. When that system works, it looks like a lot of the stories published at The Intercept — first Snowden, then the Drone Papers, and now Securus. But increasingly, leaks are shuffling off journalistic norms entirely, and the price for doing so is lower every day.
That doesn't mean publications should abandon SecureDrop — The Intercept is surely glad they kept theirs running — but it raises real questions about how leaks will work in today's media. SecureDrop was a genuinely visionary product — but like many visionary technologies, the world has gotten away from it. The idealistic view of anonymity has been replaced by something more chaotic. Having solved the problem of anonymous disclosures, we're facing the trickier problem of making them accountable.
The founder of the company that discovered the Sovaldi hepatitis C drug, which has been listed with a cost of $1,000 for a single pill, says that it's fairly cheap to make the basic ingredients for this well-regarded new medicine. It may cost only about $1,400 to manufacture a 12-week supply, or 84 pills, of the key ingredient in Sovaldi, excluding the costs of manufacturing plants, solvents, formulation, encapsulating and marketing.
That's the estimate that Raymond F. Schinazi, a founder of Pharmasset Inc. and a noted infectious-disease researcher at Emory University, put forward in a paper published in December in the journal Trends in Microbiology.
By now, Gilead Sciences Inc., which bought Pharmasset in January 2012 for $11.4 billion, may have brought down the production cost further, Schinazi said in a recent interview. “It could be even less than that,” Schinazi said.
Pharmaceutical companies have long experience with making pills, with some products having been made in large scale for more than a century.
“Even aspirin, but they still charge you a significant markup for that,” Schinazi said. “With new drugs like Sovaldi, or sofosbuvir as we used to call it, the company needs to recover its investment in research.”
Gilead has argued that spending for Sovaldi now will save programs such as Medicaid and Medicare and the Department of Veterans Affairs on future health costs, because people whose hepatitis C infections are treated with the drug will not need future treatment for serious liver damage or organ transplants.
The nonprofit AIDS Healthcare Foundation has accused Gilead of “unbridled greed,” and some activists have pointed to the high price that Gilead paid for Pharmasset as a reason for Sovaldi's pricing. Schinazi, who said they have no stake in Gilead, says there was a “bidding war” for Pharmasset with the aim of capturing Sovaldi. The drug, intended to be combined with the generic ribavirin, is considered a breakthrough in hepatitis C treatment.
There's little consensus about how much it costs to develop drugs, with estimates ranging as high as $1.7 billion for a new product.
Pharmasset, though, had an accumulated deficit of about $325 million for its roughly 13 years as an independent company, a time in which it worked on several other potential drugs in addition to advancing Sovaldi as far as testing in patients, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
“We were very efficient, extremely efficient. We have a lot of experience,” said Schinazi, whose other biotechnology ventures included Triangle Pharmaceuticals, which Gilead bought in 2003.
But Schinazi stressed that biotechnology of all sizes, startups such as Pharmasset and giants like Gilead, face long odds in their work with Sovaldi. The high prices charged for the products that make it to market compensate for failures unknown to most of the public, they said.
“There's a whole cemetery full of drugs that have failed in this particular class of compounds, a huge cemetery. You have got to look at that,” Schinazi said. “We got a bit lucky but we also did amazingly good science.”
The Environmental Protection Agency says they'll be inspecting properties on Acoma Pueblo in western New Mexico for radioactive materials. The assessment is one of numerous being conducted in the southwest, and in Indian Country.
Since 2009, the EPA says they've been doing structural assessments of properties near former uranium mills and mines, including the Navajo Nation, Laguna Pueblo and now Acoma Pueblo.
In the case of Acoma, many tribal members worked in uranium mines near the Pueblo, and the EPA says they're concerned that those miners may have brought radioactive materials home from work.
The EPA's John Rinehart says companies may have failed to alert workers to health hazards associated with unused ore, and that those materials often wound up in homes or even as decoration.
"From what we understand is that, early on, it was waste material," says Rinehart. "A lot of times when you want to make a repair at home, you just grab whatever material's available, and they may not have let them know that this could have been a problem to bring and incorporate into their homes."
Rinehart says the EPA will only be screening homes and properties for uranium ore, and will not be involved in any sort of health evaluations.

Want to string together some holiday lights? Or test an idea for a circuit? A new elastic silver ink could let users jot down electrical circuits and wiring on walls and paper with a regular ballpoint pen (ACS Nano, 2015, DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.5b05082).
[+]Enlarge ELECTRIC INK Writing circuits with a regular ballpoint pen is possible with a transparent, conductive ink made of silver salt and adhesive rubber. Brushing the traces with a formaldehyde solution reduces the silver salt to silver nanoparticles that make the trace conductive. Credit: ACS Nano
The ink, made of silver salt and adhesive rubber, sticks to various surfaces, and the resulting circuits stay conductive despite repeated bending. If the wiring breaks, retracing the lines would fix it. “It's a very simple method to make hand-drawn stretchable circuits,” says Jun Yang, a professor of mechanical and materials engineering at the University of Western Ontario. “You can easily make wearable electronics,” they say. “Just hand draw a circuit to make a personalized T-shirt.”
Conductive silver inks have been on the market for a few years and have been used to print flexible circuits. But these inks aren't suitable for pens because they are made of silver nanoparticles, which tend to aggregate and clog the pen tip, Yang says. Other researchers have reported pen-written circuits that use silver nanoparticle-based inks. But these inks also clog over time or work only on specific substrates. Plus, they don't produce stretchable wiring.
Yang and their colleagues concocted a nanoparticle-free ink by mixing silver trifluoroacetate salt and styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS), a rubber adhesive, into butanone solvent. They also added small amounts of additive solvents such as dimethylacetamide to improve the ink's fluidity.
The team used a ballpoint pen filled with the ink to draw lines on various substrates such as paper, plastic, and a stretchable SIS film. Once the ink was dry, they brushed a solution of formaldehyde and sodium hydroxide on the lines, which reduced the silver salt to metallic silver nanoparticles, making the ink conductive. The lines have to be traced over and reduced multiple times to have good conductance. They were more conductive when written on a smooth surface like plastic.
As a demonstration, the researchers made a heart-shaped string of 14 LED lights connected with pen-written traces. The lights stay lit even when the rubber substrate is bent, twisted, and stretched.
Yang says that the concept could be used to make inks with other metals such as copper. The researchers have launched a startup, Nectro, to manufacture and sell a dual-tipped pen with a writing tip and an erasing tip containing ink that allows users to correct mistakes and redraw a circuit.
Video games have been my home since I was young, and today I'd argue that they're even more than that — they're part of my livelihood. But the experiences they've given me have always been narrow, filtered through the eyes of one beefy white guy after another.
Yes, it's hard enough to get developers to add women as playable options into their games, let alone minorities with fluid sexuality. Yes, there are a hundred reasons we've heard that seem to gently take our hand and explain why it can't be done. It's disheartening, predictable and, sometimes, bullshit.
Games can change. We just need to learn a thing or two from Kim Kardashian: Hollywood.
Why it matters
The Kim K. game is a mobile social sim in which you create a character and do your darndest to push them up the hill to fame. Two more steps to the left and it could be a brilliant piece of satire; one-step right and it's just another throwaway game banking on someone's star power and pop-culture notoriety.
And just like that, I was suddenly in control of my sexuality
The game has blown up on the app store and is already on track to make around $200 million this year. And why not? It's not that bad of a game. Completing errands while changing outfits, networking and becoming BFFs with Miss Kardashian themselves isn't that far removed from the fantasy of most games. Instead of slaughtering monsters or saving the world, we're upping our follower count and building friendships. Furthermore, the game manages to accomplish something that many video games today can't even muster.
Kim Kardashian: Hollywood's best-kept secret is actually hidden in plain sight: gay relationships.
Early on in the game, my female avatar cruised into a socialite who accused me of macking on their man. It wasn't true, of course. I'd been trying to network with the guy. One fairly catty chat later, I found myself kicking it in Kim's mansion for comfort. When they offered to hook me up with someone, they did so in the most mind-blowing way.
"Maybe you're looking to meet girls?"
And just like that, I was suddenly in control of my sexuality.
I tried the same scenario with the male avatar, feeling like I'd unlocked some special trick. Kim was happy to oblige, and I found my pompadour'd bro on a date with a dark-skinned gentleman in a white suit named Steven. Suddenly, Hollywood felt like the most progressive game I'd ever played.
Does that sound unremarkable? It's not. We live in an age where major developers refuse to include same-sex relationships, and where we still have to praise those that do. It's a gift they give us, that choice — not a basic right that's extended to everyone.
Gay characters in games are too often played up for laughs, or worse, defined by their sexuality. We can never forget that straight is considered the default, and in the eyes of these games, gay characters are an "other." The choice in Hollywood is given so simply, and the game moves on as if it's no big deal. This isn't just refreshing; it's groundbreaking.
Kim Kardashian: Hollywood is low-hanging fruit for a lot of easy criticism: materialism; our obsession with fame and stars; and even Kim herself. But just for a second, let's shelve our cynicism. Let's put aside our opinions on sex tapes and fashion and superstars and tuck away our disdain for anyone whom people believe get rich by "doing nothing." Instead, let's circle back, take a good hard look at our favorite games and ask one very simple question.
If this goddamned Kim Kardashian game can get this right, then why can't we?
