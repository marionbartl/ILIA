— Oakland, the city with no stadium plans and a halfhearted effort to hang on to the Raiders, gets to keep the team anyway — for now.
The Raiders pulled their bid to relocate to the Los Angeles area late Tuesday after it became clear the team didn't have the support from NFL owners to move.
Instead, after a long day of deliberations, NFL owners meeting at the Westin Memorial City in Houston formally approved the relocation of the St. Louis Rams to Los Angeles, with ultra-wealthy Rams owner Stan Kroenke planning a $1.86 billion stadium project in Inglewood. The San Diego Chargers were given the option to join them in Inglewood after haggling unsuccessfully for years for a new stadium.
But if the Chargers decline to move, the option to join the Rams in Inglewood will be given to the Raiders, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said.
The plan was approved by a 30-2 vote.
“This is not a win for the Raiders today, but at the same time I'm really happy for Stan Kroenke and the Rams going to Inglewood,” Raiders owner Mark Davis said at a news conference after the vote. “We'll see where the Raider Nation ends up. ... We'll be working really hard to find us a home, and that's what we're looking for.
“So for our fans and everything else, don't feel bad,” Davis said. “We'll get it right, all right.”
Chargers owner
Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross said that if the Raiders and Chargers remain in their current cities, the NFL will give each team $100 million toward new stadiums.
The owners voted the opposite of a recommendation Tuesday morning by the six-member Committee for Los Angeles Opportunities, which pushed for the league to approve a $1.7 billion open-air stadium in Carson that would have been shared by the Chargers and Raiders.
The committee's 5-1 vote did little to sway the full NFL ownership.
Kroenke, one of the wealthiest owners in the NFL, had set their sights on being the man to bring professional football back to Los Angeles, which has been out of the NFL since the Rams moved to St. Louis and the Raiders went back to Oakland before the 1995 season.
In a recent 48-page report to the 32 owners, Goodell declared the current stadium situations for the cities of San Diego, St. Louis and Oakland “inadequate and unsatisfactory.” Goodell also characterized those cities' proposals to keep their teams as insufficient.
The stadium in Inglewood is also expected to be the future site of NFL drafts, Super Bowls, Pro Bowls and the NFL scouting combine.
“I think this is going to be one of the great sports complexes in the world,” Goodell said.
Disney CEO Robert Iger, leader of the Carson project, had lobbied hard to keep that plan alive, but their pitch ultimately fell flat.
The Raiders, Chargers and Rams spent months lobbying for their Los Angeles proposals while using the threat of moving to persuade their home cities to disgorge money for new stadiums. St. Louis and San Diego capitulated, offering taxpayer funding — $400 million and $350 million, respectively — and putting together comprehensive stadium proposals.
But Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf had no such lavish plan for the Raiders and is not likely to offer any in the future. Though they said they would seek up to $90 million in public funding for infrastructure improvements around the current Coliseum, Schaaf has persistently denied a request from Davis for 120 acres of free land at the stadium site.
“We respect that the Raiders have had a really frustrating road with the city of Oakland,” Schaaf said at a news conference, also saying that she's committed to renewing stadium talks with the Raiders. “We're committed to move past that.”
Oakland and Alameda County are still in debt from a costly overhaul of the Coliseum's east end that helped lure the Raiders back from Los Angeles in 1995. The city and county each pay $11 million a year for the renovation that included “Mount Davis,” which includes a top deck that hasn't been used in years.
P. Scott McKibben, head of the O.co Coliseum Authority in Oakland, said the best course of action is for the city and team to negotiate a lease extension on the 50-year-old Coliseum while continuing talks on a long-term stadium deal. The current lease expires in weeks.

Hong Kong-based ‘curated' digital asset exchange Melotic has secured a $1.175m seed-funding round led by Ceyuan Ventures, with additional backing from Lightspeed China, Barry Silbert's Bitcoin Opportunity Corp, 500 Startups, and venture capitalist Marc Van Der Chijs.
Melotic founder and CEO Jack Wang told CoinDesk the company will use the funds to expand both its team and operations.
Melotic‘s goal is to “build a liquid multi-asset exchange to facilitate conversions between numerous digital assets”. This includes altcoins, application-specific ‘appcoins', asset-backed tokens, and other digital assets bound to arrive in future.
The firm also recently signed digital currency expert and regular commentator Tim Swanson. Tim will be Melotic's head of business development, helping to build new partnerships.
Liquidity provider
The name Melotic derives from the word “lotic”, which means ‘living in flowing water' – a reference to the liquidity the company plans to offer.
People are using bitcoin technology for crowdfunding, appcoins, and many other applications, Wang said, and Melotic aims to be the liquidity provider for these assets.
“There are unlimited possibilities for decentralized ledgers and token-based applications, and we think a key part of this infrastructure is to provide price discovery and liquidity in these assets.”
Wang believes that digital tokens will be used in numerous applications beyond just financial products. They cited potential applications such as digital rights management, application permission systems, and merchant rewards programs as some examples.
Curated selection
The company does not deal with any fiat currencies and does not sell bitcoins. With its ‘curation' of listed assets it aims to be something more discerning than the broader tents of other cryptocurrency markets out there.
The aim is not to necessarily compete with other exchanges on volumes, Wang said, but rather to focus on specific assets, and to also work directly with asset issuers to help them build their services.
There are some digital assets that won't have large trading volumes, but have interesting features and active communities, Wang said. For example, the Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast network's LTBCoin is an example of the type of new micro-economy that can be built around a custom token.
Melotic currently evaluates assets on a case-by-case basis, looking at an asset's unique features, market value, community involvement, and developer engagement as some key characteristics.
“For most of these altcoins and appcoins, it's important that we see active developer and user communities. For other assets, such as our gold-backed token, we make sure to work with reputable, professional partners.”
Exchange partnerships
Melotic seeks to become an exchange partner with other digital asset projects it finds interesting. Recently it teamed up with DigitalTangible, which has created a system for customers to buy and store physical gold, trading on its value with bitcoin.
While Melotic has already been online for a couple of months, it has remained low-key with a limited number of users while the team fine-tunes its interface design and backend infrastructure.

BELLEVUE — It could be called the unfortunate sound of the season.
The roar of a chainsaw, usually at this time of the year, preceded by high winds and downed trees.
One, 90 feet tall and 12,000 pounds, landed on top of Eric and Robin Miles' Bellevue home.
They were inside Saturday morning, when the tree came down.
“I was upstairs, the wife was downstairs. They saw it. I felt it. I thought it was an earthquake at first,” homeowner Dan Miles said.
“I was watching the trees waving in the wind and next thing I knew I saw one of the trees coming toward the house and so I yelled to my husband and said, ‘Honey, a tree is going to hit our house' and then bang and everything shook and, oh, my gosh,” homeowner Robin Miles said.
On the inside there is damage in the kitchen and in this upstairs bedroom.
But, the Miles know there is likely structural damage they cannot see.
An insurance adjuster is expected this week and the good news is no one was hurt.
“We were very, very, lucky, very lucky,” Robin Miles said.
Heath Hampton is lucky too.
The storm brought a windfall of new business for their Cloudy Sky Tree Service.
They've been working nonstop and there's still a lot of work to do.
“We've been fairly busy but this just pushes us back enough to help us get to Christmas,” tree service owner Heath Hampton said.
Now that the storm has passed the cleanup is under way and there's a lot of work still to be done to rake up leaves, clean out gutters and most importantly to clear storm drains.
Road crews are doing their part but all of us must do our part to clean drains near our homes and keep them free of debris.
“We've got about 80,000 storm drains in the city of Seattle and at this time of year they get overwhelmed when there's a big wind storm and all the leaves blow into the drains. If they can help us out by raking out their local storm drain they can stop flooding in front of their house,” Seattle Public Utilities spokesperson Andy Ryan said.
The Philippine National Police say a total of 1.049 million people have surrendered, been arrested or killed in President Rodrigo Duterte's fight against illegal drugs.
PNP Director General Ronald dela Rosa said in a press briefing on Tuesday that since Duterte took office in July the police have accomplished 70 per cent of its target in the war against drugs.
Dela Rosa said there were 1.8 million drug users and pushers based on the 2010 data by the Dangerous Drugs Board, but Duterte has said there could be as many as 3 to 4 million drugs suspects in the Philippines.
"The PNP is on a continuous campaign against criminal gangs and personalities ... with more focus on the arrest and (bringing to) account of High Value Target personalities involved in illegal drugs," dela Rosa said. Some of the drug suspects include military generals and politicians.
They said that based on the latest data, 983,232 suspected pushers and users surrendered to the police and 42,543 were arrested from July to December 27 this year.
A total of 2157 were killed during police operations, the police said.
There were in addition 3000 victims of extrajudicial killings, they said, stating that they may have been killed by the drug syndicates themselves or by vigilante groups, and some of the deaths may not have been drug-related.
Duterte gained support from the public when during the election campaign they promised to suppress drugs and defeat crime in six months.
They said most of the drug addicts sell drugs to sustain their habit and many of them are involved in other crimes.
The Philippine president however has been criticised by the United States, the European Union and the United Nations for the alleged extrajudicial killings.
Dela Rosa said the police successes so far have been accomplished within the original six-month deadline set by the president.
Duterte has moved to introduce a six-month extension because of the extent of the drug problem.
Meanwhile, Philippines authorities have seized more than 890 kilograms of methamphetamine in a series of raids this month in what Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II has described as "the biggest drug bust" in the country's history.
Aguirres in a press conference estimated the methamphetamine haul as having a street value of around 6 billion pesos ($A167 million).
Ten people, members of a group called "Red Dragon", were arrested during three raids conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and include three Chinese nationals and seven Filipinos.
Alterations:
Jet shoes are now additive instead of reaching speed. Jet shoes can be used while rolling in the air. While using jet shoes while rolling, you will slow down you roll a lot making you vulnerable, but it also gives you very interesting control mechanics.
Throwing as been reworked. Charge time is now variable depending on how long you press which makes it snappier, throwing will try to push the throw towards your actor trajectory, giving more power overthrow direction, as well as throwing in itself is more physical making up/down/backwards and strange middle of roll throws possible.
reworked scope to be a bit more useful, as well as giving a little better bullet time bonus.
auto aim now doesn't snap back and forth frantically. If you have auto aimed against a target, and it goes behind a wall, you will keep aiming towards the last visible position.
Rolling now slows down reloading by a significant amount..
Simply moving against a conveyor belt will now move you, even if you are not grabbing it like a wall grab.
Added more upgrades to slugger revolver, slugger cobra, slugger pipe and slugger breacher.
Slugger revolver now starts as it should with no extended barrel, so there are now 2 levels. Tweaked it so that starting point is lower than normal, and ending point with max is higher than before.
Tweaked all upgrade prices so that more expensive guns have more expensive upgrades. This is because I want it to be less obvious to get them, so that alternative spending possibilities are considered, and also follow better with the economy that you have when being able to afford expensive guns.

Fixed left gas bouncer in position on windy valley.
Added repair broken weapon ai.
Fixed hanging cords gathering speed invisibly, making them jump like crazy when activated. This would often make them render incorrectly too.
Max upgrade level upgrades could be left in the upgrade bench.
Did some optimizations for larger scale actor and ai code which in practice should mean smoother fps at later survival tiers.
Fixed not being able to arrange bots into teams a second time without restarting the game.

Strange rolling down wall and then not being able to slide up it again bug fixed.
fixed buying weapon, buying upgrade, and then buying the same type of gun again.
improved transition to main menu with transparent menu disabled.

Bug-fixes:
When Jackie, the woman at the center of a recent Rolling Stone article about sexual assault at the University of Virginia, gave conflicting details about their alleged gang-rape by seven fraternity brothers, news outlets were quick to suggest that they may not have been telling the truth.
But psychologists say inconsistencies in survivors' accounts of violent trauma are common. Recent neurobiology research suggests that when a person is experiencing a traumatic event, “fight or flight” hormones and neurotransmitters flood the body, affecting the way the brain encodes memories — so much so that they tend to be disjointed and out of chronological order.
Researchers say the traumatized brain can go into survival mode, capturing vivid sensory details of a life-threatening event — what a weapon looked like in a shooting, for example, or how a room smelled — while completely skipping over or scrambling details such as time or location.
Rebecca Campbell, a psychology professor at Michigan State University whose research focuses on sexual assault and violence against women, compares the experience of the brain recording its memory of an assault to taking lecture notes on tiny Post-its rather than on a full sheet of paper.
“All those Post-it notes get scattered all over the world's messiest desk,” they said. “The telling is going to be fragmented. It's going to be disorganized, because that's the way the memory is laid down in the brain. It's an imperfect capture.”
The brain can retain memories in this faulty way during any type of traumatic event, whether it's a soldier in combat, a police officer in a shooting or a driver in a car accident, Campbell said. And if the person develops post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the trauma, their or their memory of the incident is likely to be even more affected.
Campbell travels the country training law enforcement officers, prosecutors, the military, college campus staff and advocates for sexual assault survivors about this research on memory and trauma. Them goal is to raise awareness among those who respond to reports of sexual assault that survivors' memories may be jumbled and that inconsistent details may not necessarily indicate a false accusation.
That, in turn, may increase the rate at which reported rapes are prosecuted. According to the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, only 5 to 20 percent of rapes are reported to authorities, and only 0.4 to 5.4 percent of them are prosecuted.
The research done by Campbell and others throws the controversy over the Rolling Stone report into a new light. The Washington Post interviewed Jackie and several of their friends, and reported that details in their account changed over time. Rolling Stone initially blamed Jackie for the inconsistencies but then took responsibility for failing to contact the accused. That sparked a firestorm of criticism over whether the public would become more reluctant to believe similar accounts by sexual assault survivors.
“After this I can't imagine a survivor being willing to come forward about their assault at all,” Dana Bolger, co-founder of the anti-sexual assault student activist group Know Your IX, said in an email. “And as a result of Rolling Stone's mistakes, the American public will spend more time picking apart Jackie's story than demanding change from the system that failed them and so many others."
Today's blog post features detailed information on the intense, behind-the-scenes activities during Rosetta's final weeks, courtesy of Sylvain Lodiot, Spacecraft Operations Manager, at ESOC, and Laurence O'Rourke, Rosetta Science Ground Segment – Science Operations Coordinator, at ESAC.
Far from going gently into that good night, the final weeks of Rosetta's incredible journey are proving to be some of the most demanding for the mission control team at ESOC, ESA's operations centre in Darmstadt, Germany.
With the final descent profile and impact site selected (we'll aim for Ma'at, an area containing several active ‘pits' from where a number of the comet's dust jets originate – see “Rosetta's descent towards region of active pits”), and with the date and time for touch down set (planned for within 20 minutes of 10:40 UTC on 30 September, time at the comet – see footnote at the end of this post), the mission control team is now steering the craft through some of the most demanding manoeuvres since arrival at Comet 67P/C-G in August 2014.
Since 9 August 2016, Rosetta has been operating in a new ‘flyover regime' that is taking the spacecraft as close as possible to the comet's surface for a planned total of 15 very close flyovers, which are providing excellent opportunities for close-up science observations. To date, 13 close flyovers have been completed and two more (on Saturday, 17 September, and Tuesday, 20 September) are planned.
“On 5 September, we skimmed the comet just 3.9 km from its centre of mass, meaning we were about 1.9 km from the surface,” says Spacecraft Operations Manager Sylvain Lodiot.
“We gradually reduced the orbit pericentre – and hence the flyover distance – to 1.9 km; we were hoping to be able to reach 1 km from the surface in one of the next flyovers, which would offer even better opportunities for science.”
“However, navigating the spacecraft so low has been difficult and orbit determination tough. We are therefore back at 4.1 km from the comet centre [for the close flyovers]. Let's see if we are able to go down a bit in the remaining flyovers!”
Navigating into the unknown
Flying so close to the comet means that, more so than ever, the comet's irregular gravitational field cannot be ignored. For any orbits above approximately 7 km, models of the comet's gravity enable Rosetta's trajectory to be planned with exquisite accuracy – Rosetta can essentially be treated as orbiting an almost spherical body.
However, flying closer means that any anomaly in the comet's gravitational field (think: mountains) must increasingly be taken into account.
As the comet is shaped roughly like a rubber duck, its gravitational field as ‘felt' by the craft when so close is by no means constant from one point on any given orbit to the next. As the craft has not previously operated so close to the surface, the gravitational models used by the Flight Dynamics teams at ESOC to plan the trajectory and the necessary thrusters burns are giving increasingly large uncertainties.
In the first week in September, Flight Dynamics were reporting that the error in pointing Rosetta (the craft's pointing is vital as this determines instrument visibility of the comet and the direction for thrusters burns) was a whopping 8.0 degrees.
This is insignificant if you're using your phone to navigate to the local coffee shop, but is very large when controlling a spacecraft just a few thousand metres from a comet.
“Basically, we were really struggling when we were so close to the comet. We've never been there before and we just don't know the local gravitational field,” says Sylvain.
The now-famous ‘Philae found image' is an example of unwanted off-pointing caused by gravitational disturbances. The image was meant to be centred on Philae's deemed location, yet the lander actually appears at top-right, pushed to the side. The off-pointing is primarily due to the large gravitational disturbances with secondary effects from comet outgassing, among others.
The remaining three close flybys will be executed through a series of almost-daily orbit correction manoeuvres that will provide thrust on the order of just a few mm/second.
Planning on a tight cycle
The close flyby regime has meant the flight controllers have had to adopt a tightly timed, 3-day planning cycle (to match Rosetta's comet orbital period), which has been especially demanding for the flight dynamics specialists, who are now essentially working 7 days/week.
Flight dynamics must gather the radiometric and optical data received from the ground tracking stations and the spacecraft, respectively, conduct a highly detailed and very accurate orbit determination, prepare the instructions for the resulting next set of manoeuvres and deliver these to the flight control team every three days. Then repeat.
In the final week of the mission, this will be tightened up to just two days.
By 26 September, with the close flyby phase complete, Rosetta will be commanded to arc out to an orbit 16 X 23 km from the comet centre, from where it will conduct the last thruster burn that will kick it onto the final descent.
Squeezing out the last bits of science & planning the final descent science timeline
The final weeks of the mission are also very intensive for the science ground segment (SGS) team at ESA's ESAC Establishment near Madrid, home to Rosetta science operations.
The shorter, 3-day planning cycles have placed a large workload on the team as they interact with all instrument teams and the project scientist on a daily basis in order to extract the best science for the mission in these last few weeks.
The fact that the science planning needs to take into account the gradual reduction of available power (see ‘Powering down' below) and the falling data download rate makes this even more challenging. The impact of the reduced power being provided by the solar panels means that there are times when not all instruments can remain on in full science mode.
Similarly, as the spacecraft gets further from Earth, so the rate at which data can be downlinked via the ground stations is being reduced, and this causes the instrument teams to have to reduce the amount of data they generate to stay within the margins given to them.
Besides the planning of the weeks leading to the descent, the SGS team is now putting final touches on the preparation of the instrument science timeline to be executed during the final descent.
“This has proven to be highly challenging as not only are power issues at their most extreme in the final descent, but so, too, is the need to ensure that all science data generated are sent to ground in ‘real-time' as contact will be lost with the spacecraft at touchdown,” says Laurence O'Rourke, SGS Science Operations Coordinator.
“This means the SGS have set up a scenario to squeeze as much out of the instruments as possible, from as many instruments as possible, thus maximising the science output during this unique opportunity,” adds their colleague, Michael Kueppers, SGS Science Operations Coordinator.
One example relates to planning for OSIRIS images. With the final pointing strategy to be performed by the spacecraft having been agreed between the flight control team at ESOC and the OSIRIS instrument team, the science operations team is now working with the OSIRIS scientists to ensure they can provide the optimum timing of commands for their camera to match with this, in order to produce the best images feasible of the surface before contact.
As the timeline for instrument activities during descent is almost ready, and the associated command sets for all instruments are in preparation, the Science Operations team are expected to deliver the final set of instrument commands for the mission to ESOC on 23 September. At that point, preparations begin for the post-operations phase, in which a reduced team from the SGS will continue to work on Rosetta data archiving.
More details on the final instrument timeline for the descent and the Science Operations team role in its creation, as well as in post-operations, will be provided in a blog post next week.
Powering down
One of the major issues facing the mission control team in the final weeks is precisely one of the big reasons why the mission is ending now: power. The further from the Sun, the less sunlight that falls on Rosetta's pair of 16-m-long solar arrays, and every day, this is falling.
On 14 September, Rosetta was over 560 million km from the Sun and over 697 million km from Earth. Each day, these huge distances are increasing by around 1 million and 3 million km, respectively.
“On board Rosetta, we are seeing a reduction of 4 Watts of power each day. At the end of August, we were getting just 936 Watts, and we need a minimum of about 630 Watts simply to operate – this leaves about 300 for the instruments,” says Sylvain.
Flight control team shrinking
At ESOC, several members of the Rosetta flight control team have already been assigned entirely or partly to work on other missions. On the morning of 4 October, the next working day after mission end (3 October is a national holiday in Germany), all of the team will report for work on other missions and the Rosetta flight control team will formally dissolve.
Sylvain himself, as spacecraft operations manager, will continue working on Rosetta for a few more weeks, to write the post-mission report and arrange for the mission flight data to be transferred for long-term archiving at ESAC.
At ESOC, in addition to the 12 missions (18 spacecraft) currently in flight , teams are actively working on ten future missions, including Juice, BepiColombo and Solar Orbiter (see “Ground segment: preparing for launch”).
The final dive
The intense operation activities at ESOC will continue until the very end.
At 20:50 UTC on 29 September, Rosetta will fire its thrusters for about three minutes – the ‘last burn' – from an altitude of about 19 km, tipping itself onto the final descent trajectory.
The on-board commands that will trigger ‘passivation' upon impact will be activated around three hours before impact.
These will ensure that, as soon as Rosetta hits the surface, its main systems are turned off, including the attitude and control systems, as well as the main transmitter, the latter in order to meet regulations aimed at avoiding interference on deep space network communications channels.
Shortly after 08:00 UTC in the morning of 30 September, the final set of commands will be uploaded, transmitted via NASA's 70m deep-space dish at Madrid. These will include an optimized pointing profile for the final descent based on a final orbit determination done after the previous evening's final burn.
The flight control team will be on duty in the Main Control Room at ESOC on 30 September, monitoring the craft's final hours and helping ensure receipt of the last data sets from the instruments as the comet looms steadily closer.
Impact is expected to occur on 30 September at 10:40 UTC at the comet, with an estimated error of ± 20 minutes.
As the signal travel time between Comet 67P/C-G and Earth on that day will be 40 minutes, confirmation of impact is expected at ESOC at 11:20 UTC / 13:20 CEST, again with an estimated error of ± 20 minutes. This uncertainty will be reduced as the end of the mission approaches (all times are subject to change).
As soon as Rosetta hits the surface, the craft will be passivated, autonomously on board… And that will be the end of the Rosetta mission.

Don't panic but your home computer is probably running a newer version of Windows than the UK's military submarines.
Britain's Vanguard-class, missile-carrying submarines use a variant of Windows XP as their primary operating system.
The revelation comes courtesy of a Guardian article examining proposals for the Trident nuclear submarines and the future of cyber warfare.
The article discusses criticisms levied against the Royal Navy in regards to Trident, stating: “Critics point in particular to the Royal Navy's decision to install a variant of Windows XP as the operating system on its missile-carrying Vanguard-class submarines.”
“ It was cheaper than the alternatives ,” writes journalist Julian Borger, “but Windows for Submarines, as it is called, is also more vulnerable to malware as it comes off-the-shelf.”
Borger continues: “This also means there are more bugs in circulation that could affect it, and every time a submarine comes to port and gets a software patch, it is newly vulnerable.”
Windows XP was first released to manufacturing on August 23, 2001, and released for retail sale on October 25 that same year.
Microsoft Windows XP
However,
development of the software actually began in the late 1990s under the
codename “Neptune” – Roman god of the sea. Maybe that explains the Royal
Navy's decision to adopt the software.
According to the article, the Ministry of Defence insists that Trident “remains safe and secure”, stating:
“Submarines operating in isolation by design, and this contributes to their cyber resilience. We take our responsibility to maintain a credible nuclear deterrent extremely seriously and continually assess the capability of our submarines to ensure their operational effectiveness, including against threats from cyber and unmanned vehicles.”
The latest version of Microsoft's operating system is Windows 10, which was officially unveiled in September 2014. However, its consumer release didn't take place until July 29, 2015.

When Benito Mussolini was ‘executed' (jolted out of a car by some communist partisans and shot in the chest in a ditch) they did not die alone. By their side was their lover and perhaps the most significant woman in their life, Clara Petacci. CP was gunned down a moment before Mussolini himself. The corpses were driven down to Milan (unpleasant picture warning) and the two bodies were famously hung upside down with thirteen other Fascist ‘greats', before a garage in Milan's Piazzale Loreto and there they were beaten and pelted with fruit in an act that would do no nation credit but that was particularly out of character for Italy. Edda Mussolini, the best of their family, memorably called it ‘Italy's last act of love for Mussolini'. However, even this post-death, extra-judicial execution ran into some problems. Clara Petacci had been forced very rapidly out of bed that morning by the partisans and had not had time to put on their underwear. In fact when they were pushed into the car for their last murderous journey they had on only a skirt and shirt. The result was that as soon as they were hung upside down, they were exposed to the crowd. The good Catholic Milanese working their anger on the dead, immediately stopped for Clara to be put right (her skirt was pinned to their legs) and then began over…
This strange combination of viciousness and prudery is not new, particularly where women are concerned. There is one documented case of a Roman crowd becoming furious when a Christian victim was sent out naked to be tossed by oxen (in Carthage?): the games were momentarily stopped clothes were placed back on the poor woman and another animal was brought out to kill them Even the form of execution was decided in medieval centuries by the concern over how much of a woman would be seen. For example, hanging was bad because it would allow shameful glimpses to a crowd in an age where women universally wore skirts and very often did not have underwear. Burning was also dangerous in this respect, because clothes could be burnt off the witch or the scold before the body was properly incinerated: there are some striking examples of this in accounts of Joan of Arc's all too unpleasant death. The medieval French solution to this was to bury women alive, which marks an extraordinary unpleasant death – though compared with the stake… – all so any idiots who'd turned up wouldn't have to see breasts or pubic hair. Is this perhaps linked to the supposed ‘erotics' of execution. drbeachcombing AT yahoo DOT com A depressing and dubious idea.

The first (white) woman officially executed by the United States(how many women of color may have been unofficially lynched prior to that time is, of course, unrecorded). Implicated for providing a location for the villainy of planning in the conspiracy to assassinate Abraham Lincoln as the owner of the Washington D.C. boarding house near Ford's Theater in which the plot was mainly hatched, they were swept up in the public cry for revenge and attendant blood-rage which followed the event and was hung semi-publicly on a hot and muggy July day along with 3 men who were unequivocally John Wilkes Booth's co-conspirators. The event was fully covered by the newspaper reporters of the time – recorded by Matthew Brady's photographic studio as well – and widely written about in the memoirs of those in attendance. Probably more words were expended in describing in excruciatingly intimate details the last minutes of Mary Surat's life than those of all of the other principal players combined. At this time it seems they had taken leave of any rational thought, merely babbling on repeatedly requesting of those around them “Please don't let me fall.” There was some speculation as to whether they meant from the relatively high scaffold erected for the occasion or “the last drop”, as they say – or indeed whether in their mental state they even grasped the situation at all. Many words have been expended on how the executioner's fingers had tired from tying the nooses for the 3 men, making each with the usual 13 turns of rope in a classic hangman's knot, and therefore made Mary Surat's noose (which is probably in the Smithsonian Institution) with only 7 or 8 turns. Great detail also goes into the descriptions of the pause in the proceedings occasioned by what was possibly a near afterthought to tie their dress around their ankles. Of course this was meant to prevent the spectacle's potential for inadvertently satisfying any covert or overt prurient interest. This, as you note, seems a bit odd to us at our remove from the social mores of the moment when considered within the context of the process of creating an official public spectacle out of their execution, one certainly meant and designed to satisfy the overt morbid interest and rage of the populace.' Then DM I suppose it is ‘coincidence' but just today I head most of this interview with author Hilary Mantel where it was remarked that ladies that were to be beheaded were to be advised to tuck their skirts under their knees so when the swordsman lopped off their heads they would not expose themselves, only to find that the ladies, probably through talking it over amongst themselves, had already planned to do just that.' thanks Lehmansterms and DM!
As part of NY1's look last month at the city's body camera program for police, the station requested a look at footage from the program – but the NYPD said no. NY1's Courtney Gross filed the following report.
The NYPD is in the process of rolling out its body camera program to potentially thousands of officers, but officials are keeping the footage close to their vest.
Some six months ago, we filed Freedom of Information Law request, known as a FOIL, with the NYPD. We wanted to review five weeks of unedited video footage from its body camera program. Still in its pilot phase, some 54 officers across six precincts are wearing cameras.
Initially, the NYPD rejected our request for unedited video, claiming privacy. They wanted to charge us $36,000 for edited video.
We appealed that decision, and now, in a five-page response, the NYPD is once again saying no to handing that unedited footage over.
In part, One Police Plaza says an agency does not have to engage in a blanket, indiscriminate disclosure of its records.
It says their cameras have captured video exempt from the state's disclosure law, like footage that depicts an officer seeking advice from a colleague, or video showing a victim of a sex crime, as well as footage that shows an officer engaging in "purely private behavior."
The NYPD says in order to redact these private interactions, a police officer has to review about 200 hours of footage and, they claim, spend 114 hours redacting it, ultimately giving us a slice of the footage at a cost that they say is more than $36,000.
The state's public disclosure law prohibits an agency from charging a requestor to locate and review any public record.
Either way, Police Commissioner William Bratton has made it clear: they are not interested in giving the public access to the video recorded by their officers.
"The position that the department is taking, I would take at this juncture, we have never released 911 calls, and video recorded by these officers, I think would be under the same protection of not being released, even to FOIL requests," Bratton said on September 2.
PATRIOTIC pundits might make something of the timing, just before America's Independence Day. As Americans prepared to celebrate the settlers who stuck it to the British in 1776, their government stuck it to a British drug firm. On July 2nd the Justice Department announced details of a $3 billion payment from GlaxoSmithKline, the old country's biggest pharmaceutical-maker. The deal, which resolves a pile of criminal and civil charges, is the largest health-fraud settlement in American history.
The size of the deal is not new—it was announced in November—but the details are. Glaxo agreed to plead guilty to three criminal counts: the misbranding of two antidepressants and the failure to tell regulators about safety data for a diabetes drug. Those plea deals included $1 billion in payments. Glaxo also agreed to an additional $2 billion to settle civil charges under the False Claims Act.

Glaxo allegedly used spa treatments, trips to Hawaii and hunting excursions to coax doctors to write prescriptions for unapproved uses of certain drugs. In the case of Paxil, an antidepressant, Glaxo was said to have promoted a journal article that overstated the drug's benefits for children.
In recent years, American prosecutors have accused nearly every big drug firm of nefarious sales tactics. Several have settled (see table), including Abbott Laboratories in May ($1.5 billion) and Pfizer in 2009 ($2.3 billion). To pursue these cases, the department has used an old but handy statute. The False Claims Act was passed during the civil war, to stop contractors from swindling the Union army. Congress gave it new life in 1986, promising big payouts for citizens who blew the whistle on firms that defrauded the government.
At first defence contractors were the main targets. More recently, drug firms have been a gold mine. Firms have been particularly vulnerable to charges of “off-label marketing”. America bars drug firms from promoting their pills for uses not approved by regulators. But doctors are free to prescribe drugs for such uses, which is why drug reps schmooze them.
Are huge fines enough to curb dodgy drug peddling? Glaxo insists that it has reformed. The firm says it has fired some of those involved in transgressions, though it has not disclosed numbers or names. It has also changed internal incentives for drug salespeople, to discourage mis-selling. As part of its “corporate integrity agreement” with the Justice Department, it now may revoke an executive's bonus if they or a subordinate engages in shady deeds.
Patrick Burns of Taxpayers Against Fraud, an advocacy group, is not impressed. Individual executives pocket the benefits of malpractice, whereas stockholders pay the fines that result. So the way to deter future wrongdoing would be to punish individual executives, they say. The fear of jail might make them think twice before overpromoting a pill.
Peek into Alissa Hansen's closet and you won't see much.
There are three pairs of pants, a couple of dresses, some skirts, two lightweight scarves, a few blouses and T-shirts, their favorite turquoise wrap and three jackets.
Count it up and there are just 33 items, including shoes and bags, their entire wardrobe for this summer.
It's plenty, said Hansen, a stay-at-home mom and artist in Denver.
“When I open my closet, I like how it feels,” Hansen said.
Launched in 2010 by a blogger in Salt Lake City, the minimalist clothing challenge Project 333 is gaining popularity around the world as people elect to say goodbye to closets jam-packed with “fat” jeans, dated dresses and “maybe someday” shirts in favor of a capsule wardrobe of only 33 items for the next three months.
It's one of the dramatic ways people are challenging themselves to change their relationship with clothing — to become smarter consumers and to save time and closet space.
“With 33 things, it's only what you want to wear,” Hansen said. “Now when I shop, I really consider, ‘Will I want to wear this? Do I love this?' If you only like it in the store, you're not going to love it at home. I don't buy those things anymore.”
For Project 333 founder Courtney Carver, the closet challenge started as something they did just to see if they could.
They aren't a shopaholic by any stretch, but they were a shopper. They wanted to know: Could they go three months without shopping? Could they restrict the size of their closet and be happy?
“For every event or holiday, I felt like I needed something new,” Carver said. “It never crossed my mind that someone at last year's Christmas party wouldn't remember what I wore the year before.”
So, they laid out all the clothing they owned and evaluated each piece. A total of 33 items, accessories and shoes included, went back into their closet; the rest got boxed up.
At the end of three months, they decided to do it all again, for the next three-month season.
They also realized they didn't like a lot of the clothes they had packed away any more anyway. They donated a giant pile.
Four years later, they haven't looked back.
They get dressed faster and spends less energy making clothing decisions. They save money by not going shopping unless something wears out or no longer fits. They ignore the weekly sale flyers. They know their personal style better than ever.
“My mornings are so much easier because I don't open up my closet and think, ‘Oh my god, I have nothing to wear,'” Carver said. “Even when I had a full closet, I always gravitated toward a small chunk of clothing anyway.”
Them advice to Project 333 prospects: Don't get hung up on the numbers and rules.
If shoes are your stumbling block, don't include them in your 33, they said. If you can't imagine only 33 items but can limit yourself to 50, go for it.
If your jeans bust a hole, replace them. If you change your mind about an item, swap it out for something else. (Workout gear is excluded from the count, for the record.)
“The worst thing you could do is make this a project in suffering,” Carver said. “This is life. This should be fun.”
A student of all things minimalist, Hansen has been doing Project 333 off and on for a couple of years since stumbling upon Carver's blog.
Through the process, she's been able to winnow their collection of clothes down by at least half, giving away some 100 items. Now, all their clothes fit in the closet and a dresser, both of which they share with their husband.
“The first time I did it, I looked and said, ‘Oh my goodness, this is not enough. It's so sparse,' ” Hansen said. “But I found out it's plenty. You just have to be creative.”
Them family takes it a step further, too, by practicing a “one-in, one-out” rule. For every new item they purchase, another must be given away.
“The more I whittle down, the more I'm free,” they said. “Those unnecessary things weigh you down.”
Michelle Jackson of Denver took another approach for their closet challenge.
A self-proclaimed fashion lover, Jackson went 365 days without buying a single piece of new clothing, shoes or accessories.
By April 1, the end of their yearlong shopping fast, they had “exploded” two pairs of pants, worn other items ragged and hated almost everything in their closet.
But they were also happier and had saved $3,300-$4,000, they said.
“I didn't know what to expect, but it really changed the way I thought about consumerism and shopping,” Jackson said. “I think more about the value of the dollar and the amount of energy I spent making that dollar.”
They documented their experience on their blog, shopmyclosetproject.com.
Since breaking the fast, Jackson has returned to the mall, but with a strict annual budget — $1,800, or roughly half of what they typically spent on clothes pre-fast.
Them wardrobe is also half the size it once was, with many of the new items purchased secondhand at Goodwill and with an emphasis on higher quality, American-made items.
“I love fashion. I can't pretend that I'm not going to covet certain things,” Jackson said. “I'd rather have a budget, have a limit and own the fact that I like shopping.
“There was no way I was going to become the all-black, every day person. That's just not me.”
Jackson recommends starting out by just cleaning your closet and getting rid of anything “you don't feel good about when you put it on.”
Then, take a month of no shopping and see how you feel — when did you want to go to the mall? What was your motivation? How were you feeling?
“It's so funny — I used to buy new things for a trip. The people in that city have no idea who I am and don't care what I wear,” Jackson said.
“People don't notice what you're wearing unless it's super bad or super amazing. Most of what you wear is somewhere in between. Realizing that has shifted the way I buy things,” they said.
“Look nice, smell good and you're good.”

Smaller wardrobe starts with honesty
Ready to downsize your wardrobe? Project 333 founder Courtney Carver offers their top three tips for creating a capsule wardrobe for the first time.
1. Start with an honest inventory. What do you actually own? If you can empty your closet, drawers and any items in storage and look it at all in one place, you can see what you haven't worn in a long time, what you forgot you had and what you wear frequently.
2. Remove the easy stuff first. Box up the things that don't fit the season, your body or your lifestyle. Donate items you know you won't use and store the rest.
3. Put a limited number of items (33 for Project 333) back in your closet. Use the pieces you wear most frequently to identify your core neutral color and build around that. Box up everything that's left over for three months and then revisit after you've had time to dress with less.

Being pregnant does weird things to your appetite. It can make you crave food at all times of day and night, or salivate for odd combinations such as ice cream with pickle juice. Some mothers-to-be, though, crave food that is not food at all — a phenomenon known as "pica." Author Sera Young released a book this month on this seemingly unsavory urge. Here's a quick guide:
What is pica?
"Pica is the scientific term for the craving and subsequent consumption of nonfood items," writes Young. The word comes from the Latin for "magpie." The eating of dirt, clay, or earth is referred to as "geophagy" in modern medical literature.
So... why do pregnant women eat dirt?
Scientists haven't pinned down an exact reason, writes Young, but it's either a response to mineral deficiencies or an instinctual effort to "protect against harm from toxins and pathogens." Clay has a high mineral content, says Marc Lallanilla at ABC News, and is often rich in calcium, iron, copper, and magnesium. "These are essential minerals for the human diet, but even more critical during pregnancy." It may also help with the symptoms of morning sickness.
Is pica just eating dirt?
No. Ice is by far the most common nonfood item enjoyed by pregnant women, reports Mental Floss. It's so common it has its own term — "pagophagy." Certain expectant women also enjoy chowing down on laundry soap, chalk, and talcum powder.
Is pica unique to pregnant women?
No — but it does happen primarily to pregnant women. In some cultures, says Maggie Koerth-Baker at BoingBoing, "eating dirt is the go-to pregnancy 'gotcha' symptom" — the telltale equivalent of morning sickness. Children have also been known to succumb to pica, writes Young, although there are few studies to back that up. A 1990 study found that 1.7 percent of children in upstate New York regularly ate nonfood items.
How common is this?
It's a worldwide phenomenon. Although only 0.01 percent of pregnant women in Denmark admit to eating dirt or clay, as many as 56 percent of pregnant Kenyan women do so, writes Young. It's common enough in the U.S. that a shop in White Plains, Ga., sells "geophagic earth," or kaolin, to those hungering for the taste of clay.
Isn't it bad for you?
No. Clay and dirt are easily digestible, and most people who practice geophagy make sure they're eating clean or fresh earth from the subsurface of the ground. Bacteria, parasites, and other pathogens are normally found higher up, in the topsoil. The only downside of eating clay is that it can give you constipation. Kaolin, or white clay, is the active ingredient in anti-diarrhea medicine Kaopectate.
What does it taste like?
Experts say really good clay can taste "the way that the ground smells when it's real dry and a little sprinkle of rain falls." There's really only one way to find out, though — head out to the garden and try some yourself.

Wonderloop, the Norwegian founded video profile startup just closed what appears to be the world's first ever deal to solely be conducted over Snapchat, recounts founder and CEO Hanna Aase.
Exchanging snaps with serial entrepreneur Evan Luthra they closed the deal entirely over the messaging service, with the only email being sent between the two being the term sheet itself.
Hanna Aase confirmed the unconventional deal on LinkedIn and via Facebook this afternoon:
And here's Evan Luthra's ‘Snap' confirming the deal:
Hanna believes that ‘Snapping' people, including investors, is a lot less intrusive than email, while on the investor side it's certainly an interesting way to widen your dealflow, meaning we could see an increase in deals like these in the future, implicating that the term ‘Snapdeal' could be a word to add to your vocabulary sooner rather than later. If you weren't already familiar with India's largest shopping site, of course. Next up, a Tinderdeal?
Orlistat is a drug designed to treat obesity. It is marketed as a prescription drug under the trade name Xenical by Roche in most countries, and is sold over-the-counter as Alli[2] by GlaxoSmithKline in the United Kingdom and the United States.[3] Its primary function is preventing the absorption of fats from the human diet by acting as a lipase inhibitor, thereby reducing caloric intake. It is intended for use in conjunction with a healthcare provider-supervised reduced-calorie diet.[4]
Orlistat is the saturated derivative of lipstatin, a potent natural inhibitor of pancreatic lipases isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces toxytricini.[5] However, due to its relative simplicity and stability, orlistat was chosen over lipstatin for development as an anti-obesity drug.[6]
The effectiveness of orlistat in promoting weight loss is definite but modest. Pooled data from clinical trials suggest that people given orlistat in addition to lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, lose about 2–3 kilograms (4.4–6.6 lb) more than those not taking the drug over the course of a year.[7] Orlistat also modestly reduces blood pressure and appears to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes, whether from the weight loss itself or other effects. It reduces the incidence of diabetes type II in people who are obese around the same amount that lifestyle changes do.[8]
Benefits aside, however, orlistat is notorious for its gastrointestinal side effects (sometimes referred to as treatment effects), which can include steatorrhea (oily, loose stools). They decrease with time, however, and are the most frequently reported adverse effects of the drug.[4] In Australia, the United States and the European Union, orlistat is available for sale without a prescription.[9] Over-the-counter approval was controversial in the United States, with consumer advocacy group Public Citizen repeatedly opposing it on safety and efficacy grounds.[10] Generic formulations of orlistat are available in some countries. In Australia it has been listed as an S3 medication -- available from a pharmacist without a prescription -- since 2000.[11]
Medical uses [ edit ]
Orlistat is used for the treatment of obesity. The amount of weight loss achieved with orlistat varies. In one-year clinical trials, between 35.5% and 54.8% of subjects achieved a 5% or greater decrease in body mass, although not all of this mass was necessarily fat. Between 16.4% and 24.8% achieved at least a 10% decrease in body fat.[4] After orlistat was stopped, a significant number of subjects regained weight—up to 35% of the weight they had lost.[4] It reduces the incidence of diabetes type II in people who are obese around the same amount that lifestyle changes do.[8] Long-term use of orlistat also leads to a very modest reduction in blood pressure (mean reductions of 2.5 and 1.9 mmHg in systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively).[12][needs update]
Contraindications [ edit ]
Orlistat is contraindicated in:[4]
Side effects [ edit ]
The primary side effects of the drug are gastrointestinal-related, and include steatorrhea (oily, loose stools with excessive flatus due to unabsorbed fats reaching the large intestine), fecal incontinence and frequent or urgent bowel movements.[13] To minimize these effects, foods with high fat content should be avoided; the manufacturer advises consumers to follow a low-fat, reduced-calorie diet. Oily stools and flatulence can be controlled by reducing the dietary fat content to somewhere in the region of 15 grams per meal.[14] The manual for Alli makes it clear that orlistat treatment involves aversion therapy, encouraging the user to associate eating fat with unpleasant treatment effects.[15]
Side effects are most severe when beginning therapy and may decrease in frequency with time;[4] It has also been suggested that the decrease in side effects over time may be associated with long-term compliance with a low-fat diet.[16]
On 26 May 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a revised label for Xenical to include new safety information about cases of severe liver injury that have been reported rarely with the use of this medication.[17]
An analysis of over 900 orlistat users in Ontario showed that their rate of acute kidney injury was more than triple that of non-users.[18] The putative mechanism for this effect is postulated to be excessive oxalate absorption from the gut and its subsequent deposition in the kidney, with excessive oxalate absorption being a known consequence of fat malabsorption.
An April 2013 study published in the British Medical Journal [19] looked at 94,695 patients receiving orlistat in the UK between 1999 and 2011. This study showed no evidence of an increased risk of liver injury during treatment. They concluded:
The incidence of acute liver injury was higher in the periods both immediately before and immediately after the start of orlistat treatment. This suggests that the observed increased risks of liver injury linked to the start of treatment may reflect changes in health status associated with the decision to begin treatment rather than any causal effect of the drug.
Despite a higher incidence of breast cancer amongst those taking orlistat in early, pooled clinical trial data—the analysis of which delayed FDA review of orlistat[20]—a two-year study published in 1999 found similar rates between orlistat and placebo (0.54% versus 0.51%), and evidence that tumors predated treatment in 3 of the 4 participants who had them.[21] There is evidence from an in vitro study to suggest that the introduction of specific varied preparations containing orlistat, namely the concurrent administration of orlistat and the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, can induce cell death in breast cancer cells and block their growth.[22]
Fecal fat excretion promotes colon carcinogenesis. In 2006 the results of 30-day study were published indicating that orlistat at a dosage of 200 mg/kg chow administered to rats consuming a high-fat chow and receiving two 25 mg/kg doses of the potent carcinogen 1,2-dimethylhydrazine produced significantly higher numbers of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) colon lesions than did the carcinogen plus high-fat chow without orlistat.[23] ACF lesions are believed to be one of the earliest precursors of colon cancer.[24]
Precautions [ edit ]
Absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and other fat-soluble nutrients is inhibited by the use of orlistat. A multivitamin tablet containing vitamins A,[25] D, E, K, and beta-carotene should be taken once a day, at bedtime, when using orlistat.[4]
Interactions [ edit ]
Orlistat may reduce plasma levels of ciclosporin (also known as "cyclosporin" or "cyclosporine", trade names Sandimmune, Gengraf, Neoral, etc.), an immunosuppressive drug frequently used to prevent transplant rejection; the two drugs should therefore not be administered concomitantly.[4] Orlistat can also impair absorption of the antiarrhythmic amiodarone.[26] The MHRA has recently suggested that Orlistat could theoretically reduce the absorption of antiretroviral HIV medications.[27]
Mechanism of action [ edit ]
Orlistat works by inhibiting gastric and pancreatic lipases, the enzymes that break down triglycerides in the intestine. When lipase activity is blocked, triglycerides from the diet are not hydrolyzed into absorbable free fatty acids, and instead are excreted unchanged. Only trace amounts of orlistat are absorbed systemically; the primary effect is local lipase inhibition within the GI tract after an oral dose. The primary route of elimination is through the feces.
Orlistat was also recently found to inhibit the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase (FAS), an enzyme involved in the proliferation of cancer cells but not normal cells. However, potential side effects of Orlistat, such as inhibition of other cellular off-targets or poor bioavailability, might hamper its application as an effective antitumor agent. One profiling study undertook a chemical proteomics approach to look for new cellular targets of orlistat, including its off-targets.[citation needed] Orlistat also show potential activities mycobacteria and Trypanosoma brucei parasite (see further reading).
At the standard prescription dose of 120 mg three times daily before meals, orlistat prevents approximately 30% of dietary fat from being absorbed.[29] Higher doses do not produce more potent effects.[4]
Legal status [ edit ]
Packaging of orlistat (Xenical) 120 mg capsules, as sold in Canada
Orlistat has historically been available by prescription only, and this situation continues in Canada. In Australia, the European Union,[30] and the United States, certain formulations of orlistat have been approved for sale without a prescription.
Australia and New Zealand [ edit ]
In Australia and New Zealand, orlistat has been available as a "Pharmacist Only Medicine since 2000.[11] In 2007 the Committee decided to keep orlistat as a Schedule 3 drug, but withdrew its authorization of direct-to-consumer Xenical advertising, stating this "increased pressure on pharmacists to provide orlistat to consumers...this in turn had the potential to result in inappropriate patterns of use".[31]
United States [ edit ]
On 23 January 2006, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel voted 11 to 3 to recommend the approval of an OTC formulation of orlistat, to be marketed under the name alli by GlaxoSmithKline.[32] Approval was granted on 7 February 2007,[33] and alli became the first weight loss drug officially sanctioned by the U.S. government for over-the-counter use.[34] Consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen opposed over-the-counter approval for orlistat.[10]
Alli became available in the U.S. in June 2007. It is sold as 60 mg capsules—half the dosage of prescription orlistat.[10][34]
European Union [ edit ]
On 21 January 2009, the European Medicines Agency granted approval for the sale of orlistat without a prescription.[30][35]
Generic formulations [ edit ]
U.S. patent protection for Xenical, originally to end on 18 June 2004, was extended by five years (until 2009) by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The extension was granted on 20 July 2002,[36] and expired on 18 June 2009.[37]
Generic orlistat is available in Iran under the brand Venustat manufactured by Aburaihan Pharmaceutical co., in India, under the brands Orlean (Eris), Vyfat, Olistat, Obelit, Orlica and Reeshape.[38] In Russia, orlistat is available under the brand names Xenical (Hoffmann–La Roche), Orsoten/Orsoten Slim (KRKA d. d.) and Xenalten (OBL-Pharm). In Austria, orlistat is available under the brand name Slimox. In Malaysia, orlistat is available under the brand name Cuvarlix and is marketed by Pharmaniaga.
Society and culture [ edit ]
Cost [ edit ]
At times, such as in spring 2012, orlistat has come into short supply, with consequent price increases because of nonavailability of one of the drug's components.[39]
Counterfeit products [ edit ]
In January 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an alert stating that some counterfeit versions of Alli sold over the Internet contain no orlistat, and instead contain the weight-loss drug sibutramine. The concentration of sibutramine in these counterfeit products is at least twice the amount recommended for weight loss.[40]

Wearable technology. It's an exploding product category in desperate need of a category-defining product. And now, with the Consumer Electronics Show upon us, we get to see whether some company, any company, can release an uncompromised, mainstream consumer hit in 2014.
Image: Martian Martian will unveil a smartwatch (not pictured here) for a “fashion- and cost-conscious consumer who wants a notification-enabled smartwatch without breaking the bank,” says a company rep.
Manufacturers have unleashed a torrent of ambitious but confounding wearables over the last two years—perhaps you've heard of Samsung's beta-like Galaxy Gear, or Google's alpha-in-everything-but-name-only Google Glass? At CES 2014 in Las Vegas next week, many more companies will attempt to realize the unfulfilled promises of smartwatches, smart eyewear, and, yes, even wrist-worn activity trackers, because apparently we can never have enough of those.
The scent of freshly forged wearables will pervade most of CES, but the highest concentration will hover over a new TechZone area called WristRevolution. Ten smartwatch manufacturers—including Burg Limited, Cookoo, Sonostar, Kronoz, Metawatch, and Neptune Pine—will stake a claim to your human body part that's most ripe for exploration.
You probably don't know much about the Burg smartwatch company. This situation will ostensibly be remedied by the end of CES.
Do any of these names sound familiar? Indeed. And that's what scares me about the incoming class of smartwatches, if not all wearables: If industry heavyweights like Samsung and Sony can't figure out mini-computers that strap to our wrists, then how can we expect success from a no-name Hong Kong brand like Cookoo, or even Kronoz with its fancy Swiss pedigree? And then there's Burg Limited. Look at the image on the left. Is this smartwatch marketing or a Saturday Night Live sketch?
At least Qualcomm—a name so big it has its own sports stadium—will also have a presence in the WristRevolution pavillion, presumably showing off its already released Toq smartwatch. And it looks like Epson, another proud consumer electronics warhorse, will demo new wrist and smartglass wearables at this year's CES. “Epson was one of the first companies to launch smart glasses back in 2012,” says Anna Jen, Epson's director of New Ventures/New Products. “Based on input from our development community, we'll be launching our next-generation Moverio smart glasses in 2014.”
The hope behind the hype
I overcome with a mixture of excitement and dread over what awaits my wearable-curious anatomy in Las Vegas.
Wearable tech clearly has legs, and is projected to grow into a $19 billion market in the next four years, with consumer spending ballooning by more than 1200 percent by 2018. And my general feelings for wearables are warm and supportive. I'm jazzed by the prospect of strapping sensors and microchips to my temples and wrists. It's just so irresistibly gadgety.
Still, aside from a small collection of fitness products, currently available wearable offerings are difficult to use and aesthetically challenged. They confuse users (I'm looking at you, smartwatches). They elicit contemptful stares (I'm looking at you, Google Glass). Bluntly speaking: They're not very good.
Glass might feel like a shipping product, but let's not forget that all current owners are essentially alpha testers, paying Google $1500 for that privilege, no less.
The situation evokes memories of 2011 when traditional laptop manufacturers reacted to the stunning success of the iPad with a throng of flawed Android tablets. But this time around there's not even an iPad to validate the concept. At least one industry analyst, however, is optimistic.
“The wearables market is experiencing a hype bubble right now, but so did the Internet in 1999, and that didn't make the Internet any less important,” says J.P Gownder, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research. “Still, wearables vendors need to make sure that they are solving unique problems for users. A smartwatch that simply replicates the same activities you can do by pulling your smartphone out of your pocket won't find a huge market.”
Activity trackers step to the front of the line
Activity trackers form the one wearables category that's somewhat mature, and not defined from top to bottom by flawed design. Certainly, a number of bottom-feeding fitness-tech companies will make a showing at CES 2014, if only because it's so easy to pack a simple wristband with an accelerometer, pair it with some off-the-shelf algorithms, and then go to market.
image: basis The Basis B1 activity tracker trumps the competition with sensors that track heart rate, skin temperature and perspiration.
But a number of proven fit-tech players will also be at the show, and I'm excited to see how they'll evolve their gear. Basis, the company that trumpets the greatest array of body sensors in any wrist-worn activity tracker, will be showing the just-announced Carbon Steel Edition of its wrist band, and demoing its new Advanced Sleep Analysis features, which reveal REM sleep patterns.
Basis CEO Jef Holove tells me they “anticipates a shift” in how manufacturers approach fitness-tracking hardware. “When Apple released the iPhone 5 with the M7 processor, it became even more clear that many of the basic functionalities of trackers would be assumed by users' smartphones, creating a challenge for health trackers to do something more,” Holove says. “For Basis, we've been taking this approach from the start with our multiple sensors getting at real bio signals. And we expect others will begin to look for ways to do more than apps can do on their own.”
Then there's Fitbit, which has a large line of activity trackers, and will be at the show for the third year in a row. I don't expect any new wearables from this company, as it just released the Fitbit Force in October. But perhaps we'll see overall platform updates, or some kind of announcement that keeps one of the biggest names in activity tracking in the CES news mix.
Fitbug, famous for attaching an affordable $50 price tag to its activity trackers, says it will release a new iteration of its Fitbug Orb product. We'll also see a $100 activity tracker (and a smartwatch!) from Archos, a company with a rich if quiet history in tablets. And if this week's tweet from @evleaks is to be interpreted as a harbinger of CES riches, then we might also see a wristband presumptively known as the Lifeband Touch, a rumored activity tracker from LG.
Image: i4C Innovations What's really going on inside your dog? The Voyce activity-tracking collar is designed to share fresh insights.
But the activity tracker I'm most interested in seeing isn't even designed for humans. Yes, sensor-driven, quantified-self hardware has finally jumped the shark. Or rather... the dog.
A start-up called i4C Innovations will be unveiling VOYCE, a new wearable “vital signs and wellness monitoring tracker” for our canine friends. Created by a team of bio-medical engineers, veterinarians and dog behaviorists, the sensor-packed neck collar is designed to provide new insights into a dog's health and behavior. And if all goes according to plan, I'll be demoing the tracker at a Las Vegas dog park, chaperoned by a happy, wet-nosed Golden Retriever.
Smartglasses: Wear at your own risk
It's easy to focus on fitness trackers and smartwatches, as they're relatively comprehensible to consumers (enthusiasts, at least), and will represent the lion's share of wearables at CES. But while smart glasses spur significant “Why would I ever want this?” consumer confusion, and present a discouraging range of physical and social discomforts, I still expect to see some representation besides the Epson announcement I mention above.
Image: GlassUp If the GlassUp product we see in Las Vegas looks anything like this rendered image, then the future appears, well, more fashionable for face-mounted wearables.
Vuzix showed off its M100 smartglasses at last year's CES, and the company will be back again to show off its augmented-reality specs, which float a small head-up display in your line of vision. The M100s went retail in December for $1000. GlassUp will also be back in Las Vegas this year, showing off its eponymous specs that project simple strings of text (tweets, email, etc) directly in your sight line. If nothing else, the GlassUp take on augmented reality is stylish, and might relieve users of the public shaming provoked by Google Glass.
And of course I'll be on the ground at CES, covering the wearables scene, and sharing images of the show from Glass via my @jonphillipssf Twitter feed and Google+ account. Google's eyewear gives me neck cramps and eyestrain if I glance at its screen for long, extended periods, but at least in a sea of tech-obsessed humanity, I stand a good chance of avoiding public ridicule wearing Glass.
CES 2014 will be nothing if not wearables-friendly.

The actor also starred on the soap opera 'Days of Our Lives' and with Kurt Russell in 'The Barefoot Executive.'
Heather North, the longtime voice of the danger-prone Daphne Blake on TV's Scooby-Doo, has died. They were 71.
North died Nov. 30 at their home in Studio City after a long illness, family friend Jodie Mann told The Hollywood Reporter.
Them husband, H. Wesley Kenney, the Emmy Award-winning producer and director of soap operas who helmed every episode of the tumultuous 1974-75 season of All in the Family, died in January 2015.
North and Kenney had met on the set of Days of Our Lives and were married in 1971. They had played Sandy Horton for a few years on the NBC daytime serial.
A native of Pasadena, North also starred as Kurt Russell's love interest in Disney's The Barefoot Executive (1971), about a chimpanzee who can predict which TV shows will be a success on the air.
North was first heard as Daphne in September 1970 on the second-season opener of the CBS/Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning hit Scooby Doo, Where Are You!. (Stefanianna Christopherson had voiced Daphne during the first season.)
North then returned for The New Scooby-Doo Movies in 1972-73 and in many other incarnations of the cartoon through 2003.
North also appeared on such TV shows as Mr. Novak, Gidget, The Fugitive, The Monkees, My Three Sons and Adam-12; on the big screen in Git! (1965) and I Love My Wife (1970); and on Broadway in the short-lived 1967 comedy The Girl in the Freudian Slip.
Survivors include their son Kevin and daughter-in-law Stephanie; stepdaughter Nina and their husband Brent; stepson Wes and their wife Leslie; and granddaughter Jocelyn. Another stepdaughter, Kara, died just a week ago.
A memorial service is set for 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday at First Christian Church in Studio City.
Image caption There is new evidence that ketamine can cause severe bladder damage
The drug ketamine should be upgraded from a Class C drug to Class B, government advisers have recommended.
The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs said new evidence had shown frequent ketamine use could cause "severe and disabling" bladder damage.
Under the new classification, illegal possession of ketamine could lead to a five-year jail sentence.
Ketamine is an anaesthetic used for operations on humans and animals that has become a popular recreational drug.
Home Office figures released in the summer showed that in the past year about 120,000 people aged 16-59 in England and Wales took ketamine, which is best known by the street names K, Special K and vitamin K.
'Bladders removed'
Home Secretary Theresa May asked the Council to review the evidence on ketamine last year amid increased concern about its popularity and potential harm the drug can cause.
Case study "Molly", 25, is waiting for a bladder-stretching operation after damaging it by taking ketamine. "It sounds a bit strange to say you're looking forward to an operation - but I'm hoping it'll be the start of an end. "I have to go the toilet three times an hour. It takes me ages, and it's absolute agony. "The only thing that takes that away is ketamine. It's sort of like a vicious cycle. "I'm actually peeing blood - sizeable blood clots. "Ketamine being Class C is completely ridiculous. "It has not taken that long for me to completely ruin my bladder." Long-term users on the effect of ketamine
It has gathered new evidence suggesting some people are taking large amounts of ketamine every day, risking severe damage to their bladders.
In the most serious cases users have had to undergo surgery to have their bladders removed.
The council said the decision to reclassify ketamine was not unanimous, but was backed by a majority of its members.
The advisory group's chairperson, Prof Les Iversen, said they were not sure if the home secretary would take their advice and reclassify the drug, saying: "I've learnt that you give advice and it's not always taken."
An upgrade from Class C to Class B means those found in possession of the drug would face up to five years in prison, up from two, and those caught supplying it up to 14 years prison or an unlimited fine.
The average prison sentence served for possession of a Class B drug in 2012 was just over two months, while people convicted of supply served an average of 17 months.
Other Class B drugs include amphetamines and cannabis.
The council also recommended that ministers consider tighter controls on the way the drug is stored by pharmacies and hospitals.
Prof David Nutt, a former government adviser, said that if rules on the legal use of ketamine were changed and it had to be kept under lock and key, vets would not be able to use the drug in the field and animals "will suffer".
They said there was no evidence the drug was being taken from clinical stores, "so there is absolutely no need for this change".
Prof Valerie Curran, professor of psychopharmacology at University College London, agreed, and added that they were pleased the medical community would be consulted before the final decision was made.
"Molly", 25, is waiting for an operation to stretch their bladder after they damaged it through ketamine use.
They said it was "agony" to go to the toilet, and there were often "sizeable blood clots" in their urine.
"Ketamine being Class C is completely ridiculous. It's not taken that long for me to completely ruin my bladder," they told the BBC's Newsbeat.

First reports of ketamine being used as a recreational drug emerged soon after its release on to the market in 1965.
It gained popularity in the UK nightclub scene in the early 1990s as people bought it in the mistaken belief that it was ecstasy.
Ketamine is dose-specific, so the amount taken determines the level of effect.
It comes in various forms, most commonly as a powder, but also as a liquid and a tablet.
At low doses the user may feel euphoric, experience waves of energy, and possibly synaesthesia - sensations such as seeing sounds or hearing colours.
However, some evidence suggests that use of the drug has an effect on memory, which persists for longer than three days after use, and becomes worse for regular users of the drug.
Government figures suggest the number of ketamine-related deaths peaked at 21 in 2009, falling to six last year.
Did you ever want to substitute the equals and hashCode methods a HashSet or HashMap uses? Or have a List of some element type masquerade as a List of a related type?
Transforming collections make that possible and this post will show how.
Overview
Transforming collections are a feature of LibFX 0.3.0, which will be released any day now. This post will present the general idea, cover technical details and finish with some use cases where they might come in handy.
UPDATE In the meantime, version 0.3.0 was released. While this post might get out of date at some point, the wiki page for transforming collections will be updated. If you're a visitor from the future, make sure to check it out.
The ongoing example is a slightly adapted variant of the feature demo contained in LibFX. Keep in mind that it is only an example to demonstrate the concept.
Transforming Collections
A transforming collection is a view onto another collection (e.g. list onto list, map onto map, …), which appears to contain elements of a different type (e.g. integers instead of strings).
The view elements are created from the inner elements by applying a transformation. This happens on demand so the transforming collection itself is stateless. Being a proper view, all changes to the inner collection as well as to the transforming view are reflected in the other (like, e.g., Map and its entrySet).
Nomenclature
A transforming collection can also be seen as a decorator. I will refer to the decorated collection as the inner collection and it's generic type accordingly as the inner type. The transforming collection and its generic type are referred to as outer collection and outer type, respectively.
Example
Let's see an example. Say we have a set of strings but we know that those strings only ever contain natural numbers. We can use a transforming set to get a view which appears to be a set of integers.
(Comments like // "[0, 1] ~ [0, 1]" are the console output of System.out.println(innerSet + " ~ " + transformingSet);.)
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Set <String> innerSet = new HashSet <> ( ) ; Set <Integer> transformingSet = TransformingCollectionBuilder /* skipping some details */ . transformSet ( innerSet ) ; // both sets are initially empty: "[] ~ []" // now let's add some elements to the inner set innerSet . add ( "0" ) ; innerSet . add ( "1" ) ; innerSet . add ( "2" ) ; // these elements can be found in the view: "[0, 1, 2] ~ [0, 1, 2]" // modifying the view reflects on the inner set transformingSet . remove ( 1 ) ; // again, the mutation is visible in both sets: "[0, 2] ~ [0, 2]"
See how pleasant transformations can be?

Details
As usual, the devil is in the details so let's discuss the important parts of this abstraction.
Forwarding
Transforming collections are a view onto another collection. This means that they do not hold any elements by themselves but forward all calls to the inner/decorated collection.
They do this by transforming call arguments from the outer to the inner type and calling the inner collection with these arguments. Return values are then transformed from the inner to the outer type. This gets a little more complicated for calls which take collections as arguments but the approach is essentially the same.
All transforming collections are implemented in a way that forwards each call of a method to the same method on the inner collection (including default methods). This implies that any guarantees the inner collection makes regarding thread-safety, atomicity, … are also upheld by the transforming collection.
Transformation
The transformation is computed with a pair of functions, which is specified during construction. One is used to transform outer elements to inner elements and another one for the other direction. (For maps two such pairs exist: one for keys and one for values.)
The transforming functions must be inverse to each other with regard to equals , i.e. outer.equals(toOuter(toInner(outer)) and inner.equals(toInner(toOuter(inner)) must be true for all outer and inner elements. If this is not the case, the collections might behave in an unpredictable manner.
The same is not true for identity, i.e. outer == toOuter(toInner(outer)) may be false. The details depend on the applied transformation and are generally unspecified – it might never, sometimes or always be true.
Example
Let's see how the transforming functions look for our sets of string and integers:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 private Integer stringToInteger ( String string ) { return Integer . parseInt ( string ) ; } private String integerToString ( Integer integer ) { return integer . toString ( ) ; }
And this is how we use them to create the transforming set:
1 2 3 4 5 Set <Integer> transformingSet = TransformingCollectionBuilder /* still skipping some details */ . toOuter ( Integer :: parseInt ) . toInner ( Object :: toString ) . transformSet ( innerSet ) ;
Straight forward, right?
Yes, but even this simple example contains pitfalls. Note how strings with leading zeros are mapped to the same integer. This can be used to create undesired behavior:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 innerSet . add ( "010" ) ; innerSet . add ( "10" ) ; // now the transforming sets contains the same entry twice: // "[010, 10] ~ [10, 10]" // sizes of different sets: System . out . println ( innerSet . size ( ) ) ; // "2" System . out . println ( transformingSet . size ( ) ) ; // "2" System . out . println ( new HashSet <> ( transformingSet ) . size ( ) ) ; // "1" ! // removing is also problematic transformingSet . remove ( 10 ) // the call returns true // one of the elements could be removed: "[010] ~ [10]" transformingSet . remove ( 10 ) // the call returns false // indeed, nothing changed: "[010] ~ [10]" // now things are crazy - this returns false: transformingSet . contains ( transformingSet . iterator ( ) . next ( ) ) // the transforming set does not contain its own elements ~> WAT?
So when using transforming collections, it is very important to think carefully about the transformations. They must be inverse to each other!
But it suffices if this is limited to the actually occurring inner and outer elements. In the example the problems only begin when strings with leading zeros are introduced. If these were forbidden by some business rule, which is properly enforced, everything will be fine.
Type Safety
All operations on transforming collections are type safe in the usual static, compile-time way. But since many methods from the collection interfaces allow objects (e.g. Collection.contains(Object)) or collections of unknown generic type (e.g. Collection.addAll(Collection<?>)) as arguments, this does not cover all cases which can occur at runtime.
Note that the arguments of those calls must be transformed from the outer to the inner type in order to forward the call to the inner collection. If they are called with an instance which is not of the outer type, it is likely that it can not be passed to the transforming function. In this case the method may throw a ClassCastException. While this is in accordance with the methods' contracts it might still be unexpected.
To reduce this risk, constructors of transforming collections require tokens of the inner and outer type. They are used to checking whether an element is of the required type and if it is not, the query can be answered gracefully without an exception.
Example
We can finally see exactly how to create the transforming set:
1 2 3 4 5 Set <Integer> transformingSet = TransformingCollectionBuilder . forInnerAndOuterType ( String . class , Integer . class ) . toOuter ( Integer :: parseInt ) . toInner ( Object :: toString ) . transformSet ( innerSet ) ;
The builder actually accepts Class<? super I> so this would compile as well:
1 2 3 4 5 Set <Integer> transformingSetWithoutTokens = TransformingCollectionBuilder . forInnerAndOuterType ( Object . class , Object . class ) . toOuter ( Integer :: parseInt ) . toInner ( Object :: toString ) . transformSet ( innerSet ) ;
(For unknown types it would be easier to call forInnerAndOuterTypeUnknown, which is equivalent to passing object tokens.)
But since everything is an object, the type check against the token becomes useless and calling the transforming function can cause an exception:
1 2 3 4 Object o = new Object ( ) ; innerSet . contains ( o ) ; // false transformingSet . contains ( o ) ; // false transformingSetWithoutTokens . contains ( o ) ; // exception
This should hence only be used if no tokens are available.
Use Cases
I'd say transforming collections are a very specialized tool, which is unlikely to be used frequently but still has a place in every well sorted toolbox.
It is important to note that if performance is critical, they can be problematic. Every call to a transforming collection which takes or returns an element causes at least one, often more objects to be created. These put pressure on the garbage collector and cause an additional level of indirection on the way to the payload. (As always when performance is discussed: profile first!)
So what are the use cases for transforming collections? We have already seen above how a collection's element type can be changed to another. While this presents the general idea I do not think it is a very common use case (although a valid approach in certain edge cases).
Here I will show two more narrow solutions, which you might want to use at some point. But I also hope this gives you an idea of how transforming collections can be used to solve tricky situations. Maybe the solution to your problem lies in applying this concept in a clever way.
Substituting Equals And HashCode
I always liked how .NET's hash map (they call it a dictionary) has a constructor which takes an EqualityComparer as an argument. All calls to equals and hashCode, which would usually be called on the keys, are delegated to this instance instead. It is thus possible to replace problematic implementations on the fly.
This can be a lifesaver when dealing with problematic legacy or library code which you do not have full control over. It is also useful when some special comparison mechanism is required.
With transforming collections, this is easy. To make it even easier, LibFX already contains an EqualityTransformingSet and EqualityTransformingMap. They decorate another set or map implementation and equals/ hashCode functions for the keys/elements can be provided during construction.
Example
Let's say you want to use strings as set elements but for comparison you are only interested in their length.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Set <String> lengthSet = EqualityTransformingCollectionBuilder . forType ( String . class ) . withEquals ( ( a , b ) -> a . length ( ) == b . length ( ) ) . withHash ( String :: length ) . buildSet ( ) ; lengthSet . add ( "a" ) ; lengthSet . add ( "b" ) ; System . out . println ( lengthSet ) ; // "[a]"
Removing Optionality From A Collection
Maybe you're working with someone who took the idea of using Optional everywhere, ran wild with it and now you're having a Set<Optional<String>>. In case modifying the code (or your colleague) is no option, you can use transforming collections to get a view which hides Optional from you.
Again, implementing this was straight forward so LibFX already contains this in the form of OptionalTransforming[Collection|List|Set].
Example
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Set < Optional <String> > innerSet = new HashSet <> ( ) ; Set <String> transformingSet = new OptionalTransformingSet <String> ( innerSet , String . class ) ; innerSet . add ( Optional . empty ( ) ) ; innerSet . add ( Optional . of ( "A" ) ) ; // "[Optional.empty, Optional[A]] ~ [null, A]"
Note how the empty optional is represented by null. This is the default behavior but you can also specify another string as a value for empty optionals:
1 2 3 4 5 Set <String> transformingSet = new OptionalTransformingSet <String> ( innerSet , String . class , "DEFAULT" ) ; // ... code as above ... // "[Optional.empty, Optional[A]] ~ [DEFAULT, A]"
This avoids Optional as well as null as an element but now you have to be sure that there is never an Optional which contains DEFAULT. (If it does, the implicit transformations are not inverse to each other, which we have already seen above to cause problems.)
For more details on this example, check out the demo.
Reflection
We have covered that transforming collections are a view onto another collection. Using type tokens (to minimize ClassCastExceptions) and a pair of transforming functions (which must be inverse to each other) every call will be forwarded to the decorated collection. The transforming collection can uphold all guarantees regarding thread-safety, atomicity, … made by the decorated collection.
We have then seen two specific use cases of transforming collections: substituting equals and hash code used by hashing data structures and removing optionality from a Collection<Optional<E>>.
A Word On LibFX
As I said, transforming collections are a part of my open source project LibFX. If you consider using it, I'd like to point out a few things:
This post presents the idea and some details but does not replace the documentation. Check out the wiki for an up-to-date description and pointers to the javadoc (currently here).
I take testing seriously. Thanks to Guava, transforming collections are covered by about 6.500 unit tests.

Phayul news service reports that two more Tibetan nuns have taken their lives due to the destruction of the city of Larung Gar in eastern Tibet (Western China). Authorities there claim that the expanse of new structures is a fire hazard and that the rapid growth of the city has not been officially permitted. I wrote this last month:
This is Larung Gar a year ago. It is a vast monastic complex in eastern Tibet (in China's Sichuan Province) housing as many as 40,000 Tibetan Buddhist monks and nuns (10,000 being a more likely number). Recently, it has come under scrutiny by the Chinese government and demolitions have recently begun, threatening up to half of the monastics living there. The town has grown rapidly, from just a handful of disciples of the Tibetan teacher from the Nyingma tradition, Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok, in the 1980s to its current size. It currently attracts Buddhists from both Tibet and China as a site for the study and practice of Buddhist teachings. Radio Free Asia has one photo of an unspecified hillside, now mere brown rubble, claimed to have once been home to dwellings like those shown above; BBC has several more images of the destruction. They report that cell phone and internet use has been curtailed by authorities since the destruction began July 20th. Armed security forces have been present to quell any kind of formal protest, and foreigners have been denied access to the area. This has led to the blackout of information on the suicide, which occurred as demolition began.
The two slain nuns – Sengma from Sichuan Province's Dowa village in Dzamthang County and Tsering Dolma from Mewa Township in Marthang County in Sichuan's Ngaba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture – have reportedly committed suicide, RFA reported. RFA's source mentioned that Tsering Dolma, “left behind a note expressing their distress at the demolition and complaining that the Chinese will not let them live in peace” and that the ordeal left them depressed and troubled, eventually leading [her] to kill herself.
For those in Australia, there is a wonderful short interview with Prof John Powers on the plight of the Tibetan people in occupied Tibet. Below is an SBS (Australia's Special Broadcasting Service) documentary: Bulldozing Tibet. As you'll see, the destruction of Larung Gar follows a pattern of destruction and displacement that goes back decades in China's continued occupation of Tibet.
Gordo with a researcher
Gordo was one of the first monkeys to travel into space. As part of the NASA space program, Gordo, also known as Old Reliable, was launched from Cape Canaveral on December 13, 1958, in the U.S. PGM-19 Jupiter rocket on its AM-13 mission. The rocket would travel over 1,500 miles and reach a height of 310 miles (500 km) before returning to Earth and landing in the South Atlantic. A technical malfunction prevented the capsule's parachute from opening and, despite a short search, neither their body nor the vessel were ever recovered.[1]
Background [ edit ]
Gordo was a South American species of squirrel monkey, about one foot tall and weighing between 1 and 1.5 kg. They were chosen for space travel because of their species' similar anatomical makeup to man and sensitivity to changes in temperature. Missions using monkeys in space were not new: four monkeys called Albert, as well as monkeys called Patricia and Mike had all flown by 1962.
The flight [ edit ]
The flight took place at 0353 hours EST when the Jupiter AM-13 rocket containing Gordo was launched from the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral. The rocket ascended to a height of 290 miles while travelling 1300 lateral miles.[2] Scientists monitoring the flight found that, aside from a slight slowing of the pulse, Gordo suffered no ill effects from the entry into space or resultant weightlessness. Gordo wore a specially customized space suit and was fitted with instruments, including a thermometer and microphone, to monitor their health.
In total the flight lasted 15 minutes, of which Gordo was weightless for 8.3 minutes, as the craft exited and re-entered Earth's atmosphere at a speed of over 10,000 miles per hour. The failure of Gordo's parachute meant that both they and the capsule were lost, despite efforts to recover them. It is believed that Gordo was alive at the time of impact.
Legacy [ edit ]
Despite the loss of Gordo, the mission was considered a success by NASA. It had gone some way towards alleviating the concerns over how the human body would cope with weightlessness and the difficulties of space travel. Less than a year later, Gordo was followed into space by the monkeys Able and Baker who survived a similar launch profile. Despite these advances, though, it would be the Russian Yuri Gagarin who would become the first human in space.

Lazarus Project Brings Damaged Texts Back to Life
Many libraries, archives and museums have in their collections textual artifacts that can no longer be read. Now a multispectral imaging initiative is uncovering value that can't be detected by the human eye in ways that were previously only available to the largest and most deeply resourced institutions, and without having to take fragile manuscripts off-site.

Many libraries, archives, and museums have in their collections textual artifacts that can no longer be read. Now a multispectral imaging initiative is uncovering value that can't be detected by the human eye in ways that were previously only available to the largest and most deeply resourced institutions, and without having to take fragile manuscripts offsite. It's called The Lazarus Project , and it's designed to give small and medium-sized institutions and individual researchers access to the most cutting-edge digital imaging technology available. The project brings a traveling multispectral lab directly to participating institutions. “We help librarians create value in their own holdings,” said Gregory Heyworth , the project's director. Ancient and modern manuscripts that are damaged or otherwise illegible are imaged using multispectral imaging—technology that records manuscripts under a controlled spectrum of light. The images are then processed to reveal details that the naked eye cannot see. Instead of exposing fragile materials to large amounts of damaging light, the Lazarus Project's portable rig takes images with light that amounts to merely opening the manuscript. This minimizes damage and comforts conservators who worry about exposing their precious papers to even more harm. The results are often surprising, as when the Lazarus Project team uncovered erased ownership signatures in Shakespeare folios at the Folger Shakespeare Library and what might be William Faulkner's fingerprints on what may be poems by the author. With the help of the expert team, erased, illegible and damaged text becomes legible material. That's important, said Heyworth. “Library collections are often forgotten by the scholars who are just next door,” they explained. “Sometimes people just don't know what exists. Once you know what you have, it's describable. We help libraries make the most of their collections, especially damaged collections.” The technology can also be used for more than just uncovering ancient erasures—more and more collections are turning to the Lazarus Project to establish a baseline of conservation data for modern objects, Heyworth said. James Kuhn worked with the Lazarus Project during their tenure as the assistant dean for Special Collections and Preservation at the University of Rochester. “Institutions are filled with printed books and manuscripts that often have been obliterated or overlooked,” they said. “There aren't a lot of opportunities for cultural heritage institutions to do work in this kind of way—we have limited budgets. It can be hard to justify investing five or six figures in multispectral imaging. Those costs are coming down year by year and that's an argument not to buy it now.” To curators and library professionals, the Lazarus Project's cost is just as intriguing as the secrets it reveals. For large institutions, it covers its team's own expenses and helps obtain grants to cover the rest of its expenses. For small institutions, its services are free. That's made possible in part by the initiative's other side: annual projects undertaken in connection with Heyworth's "Image, Text, and Technology" course at the University of Mississippi. To Heyworth, it's just as important to use today's most cutting-edge technology to create tomorrow's digital humanities experts as it is to ferret out the buried and damaged secrets that lie within collections' caches. They hope that one day, the Lazarus Project will help fuel a new generation of scholars through a minor or master's degree in textual science. For now, though, he's content to take their rig to librarians and archivists who are curious about what their collections really hold. Librarians and archivists who want the Lazarus Project to come to their institution will need a description of an object, its damage, and how multispectral imaging could help.

A transgender widow in Texas is still fighting to have their marriage (above) to their late husband recognized, even after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down same-sex marriage bans in Obergefell v. Hodges.
Nikki Araguz Loyd's husband, Thomas Araguz III, was a volunteer firefighter who was killed in the line of duty in 2010. Shortly after their death, Thomas Araguz's mother and former wife — Simona Longoria and Heather Delgado — sued Araguz Loyd, seeking to block them from collecting death benefits because she's transgender. They argued that because Araguz Loyd was born male, the marriage was void under the state's same-sex marriage ban. This was despite the fact that Araguz Loyd had been living as a woman since they were a teenager, and that both their California birth certificate and their Texas driver's license were updated to reflect their gender identity.
The case has dragged on for more than five years. In 2011, a district judge granted summary judgment to Longoria and Delgado, before an appeals court overturned that decision and remanded the case for trial. Longoria and Delgado appealed to the Texas Supreme Court, where the case is pending.
Araguz Loyd said they believe now that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in favor of nationwide marriage equality, she'll prevail and collect approximately $700,000 in death benefits. The only argument put forth by Longoria and Delgado has been that Araguz Loyd isn't entitled to death benefits because it was a same-sex marriage.
From The Texas Observer:
“I'll celebrate when I have finality, when I know that my fight is truly over, because while we do have marriage equality, there is still pending litigation disputing the validity of the marriage of a trans person based on it being a same-sex marriage, so we don't completely have marriage equality in Texas yet, but we will,” said Araguz Loyd, who has since remarried. …
Kevin Parker, an attorney for Longoria and Delgado, confirmed they plan to keep fighting and still hopes the Texas Supreme Court will hear the case.
“There's the issue regarding whether the U.S. Supreme Court decision can affect a marriage, if it existed at all, that ended years before the decision came out,” Parker said. “There's definitely a potential effect to the U.S. Supreme Court decision, and it does mean we have a higher hill to climb, but it's still going to go on until the Texas Supreme Court says otherwise.”
Araguz Loyd was the stepmother of Thomas Araguz's two children, but she's been unable to see them since their death. However, they told me they are preparing to adopt the two children of their new husband, contemporary artist William Loyd (above right). Araguz Loyd also runs the National Transgender Alliance.
Watch a report on the case, including an interview with Araguz, below.

While I am optimistic about our Commander-in-Chief's strategy to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, I voted against the Continuing Appropriations Resolution 2015 that would grant the President the authority to provide funds to train and arm Syrian rebels against the enemy. I opposed the amendment because I strongly believe amassing additional debt to go to war should involve all of America debating the matter. That is why I have called for levying a war tax in addition to bringing back the military draft. Both the war surcharge and conscription will give everyone in America a real stake in any decision on going to war, and compel the public to think twice before they make a commitment to send their loved ones into harm's way.
As a Korean War veteran, I know the plight of war. Our military is the best in the world, but war is unpredictable and chaotic. In the event that the conflict in Iraq and Syria necessitates American troops on the ground, everyone should share the sacrifices instead of the small few who are already carrying that burden.
For a decade I have been calling for the reinstatement of the draft because our military personnel and their families bear a tremendous cost each time we send them to fight. Since 2001, nearly 7,000 soldiers have paid for these wars with their lives. More than 52,000 have been wounded, many narrowly saved by the miracle of modern medicine. The 3.3 million military households have become a virtual military class who are unfairly shouldering the brunt of war. Many men and women in uniform serve multiple tours, as many as 10, and 25 percent of America's active duty military personnel suffer from Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). It is unacceptable that on average 22 veterans die by suicide every day. If war is truly necessary, we should all come together in defense of our nation, not just one percent of America.
In addition to the significant number of precious lives lost in Iraq and Afghanistan, we have accumulated too much debt to finance these wars. The United States has borrowed almost $2 trillion to fund our military engagements on foreign soil. It is estimated that the total cost would be close to $6 trillion; we continue to pay a heavy toll for these conflicts. Each dollar spent on war is a dollar not spent on education, energy, housing, or healthcare. We cannot afford to tread this same path when we are slashing domestic programs that are the lifelines for so many Americans. I will soon introduce a bill that will impose war tax to ensure that we do not have to choose between further gutting the social safety net and adding to the $17.7 trillion of national debt.

I continue to believe that under President Obama's leadership, the international community will rid itself of this cancer. Secretary of State John Kerry has reported that nearly 30 countries have stepped up to support the fight against ISIS. These countries intend to provide financial resources, intelligence, equipment and training. Furthermore, the Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi stated that their government also does not want President Barack Obama to send American ground troops to fight in Iraq. Nevertheless we must be prepared for the worst.
ISIS militants are a real threat. They have already killed two American journalists and thousands of Syrians and Iraqis in their brutal attempt to establish an Islamic caliphate. If left unchecked, they can jeopardize our core interests abroad and at home. We must share the burden in diminishing their impact to our national security. Containing their spread will help America and our allies to feel safe whether at home or abroad. Reinstating the draft and imposing the war tax will ensure that our safety is sustainable, our financial engagements abroad are not borrowed, and that all Americans have a role in defending and protecting our nation.

The Martian writer Drew Goddard will direct the opening episode of Good Place, NBC's 13-episode straight-to-series comedy series from Parks & Recreation and Brooklyn Nine-Nine co-creator Mike Schur. Helming the project, starring Kristen Bell and Ted Danson, marks Goddard TV directing debut.
It also marks a return to television for Goddard who started their career as a TV writer, working on such shows as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Alias and Lost before taking the leap to features with J.J. Abrams' Cloverfield. Their sole previous directing credit is the 2012 horror feature The Cabin In the Woods, which they co-wrote with Joss Wheden. In TV, Goddard most recently created Netflix's Daredevil, which had feature origins, before departing to work on the feature Sinister Six.
Good Place, which NBC ordered to series last summer based on a pitch, centers on Eleanor (Bell), a woman from New Jersey who comes to realize that they haven't been a very good person. They decide to turn over a new leaf by learning what it actually means to be “good” or “bad,” and then trying to make up for their past behavior. Danson plays Michael, who, through an unlikely set of circumstances, comes to be Eleanor's guide through their self-designed self-improvement course. Good Place is produced by Universal Television, where Schur is under an overall deal, 3 Arts and Fremulon. Schur executive produces with David Miner.
The Collapse of Sovereign Government Bonds The Next Financial Crisis Contagion
The next contagion is beginning to spread around the globe.
It is unexpected on Wall Street, misunderstood in Washington — and very dangerous.
It could sabotage the plans of the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and many of their counterparts overseas.
It is …
The Collapse of Sovereign Government Bonds
This is certainly not the first financial contagion of recent memory:
Back in 1997, we witnessed a currency contagion —hatched in Thailand, spreading quickly to the rest of Southeast Asia … smacking Russia in the gut … and sinking a major player in the U.S. derivatives market.
Then, 10 years later, came the debt contagion —incubated in a subsector of America's mortgage market … soon infecting nearly all credit instruments … striking Wall Street like a sledgehammer … and mortally wounding the global financial system.
Those contagions were bad enough. Now, however, the contagion is beginning at a much higher level, in the most important financial instruments on Earth — long-term bonds issued by sovereign governments.
The Saga Begins in Greece
Just 116 days ago, on October 8, Greece's benchmark 10-year bond was selling for 112.295. Today, it has collapsed to 92.13.
And the drama of its yield surge is even more striking — from only 4.41 percent to 7.14 percent, a jump of more than 60 percent in less than four months.
Coincidentally, I was in Greece not long ago, visiting the origins of Western democracy.
If a local soothsayer had told me that the next global debt contagion would begin there, blocks away from the Pantheon, I would have been incredulous. Yet that is precisely what has just happened in recent weeks.
Already, this contagion is spreading to other countries …
Portugal's 10-year government bond reached a peak on December 1, 2009, just 62 days ago. And now it has also started to plunge virtually nonstop, with its biggest declines registered late last week.
British government bonds (gilts) are equally vulnerable.
Sovereign bonds in Spain, Japan, and other major deficit nations are also starting to get hit.
Next Victim: U.S. Government Bonds
In the global competition for investor funds, U.S. Treasuries are typically viewed as the “least ugly.” So global investors have usually been willing to pay a relatively higher price for them, grudgingly accepting lower yields.
This helps explain why U.S. government bonds have not been among the first targets of the contagion. But that does not protect them from becoming one of the next targets.
Indeed …
The U.S. government suffers from the same, or worse, underlying disease as Greece, Portugal, or any other victim of the contagion — massive, out-of-control federal deficits. America's red ink was $1.4 trillion last year and ANOTHER $1.4 trillion this year.
Washington has buried its head in the same mound of sand as Athens and Lisbon — grossly underestimating (a) the size of the deficit, (b) its potential impact on investor confidence, and (c) the speed by which its bond prices can fall.
Like their counterparts in Athens and Lisbon, President Obama ignored advisors who warned of a deficit disaster and has only just begun to seriously consider deficit-reduction measures. And yet they continue to avoid steps that can make a significant difference.
Specifically …
The president supports a commission to study deficit reduction (rejected by the Senate last week) … but the commission's recommendations would be nonbinding with no clear process in place for implementation.
The president has proposed a freeze on some domestic spending, but the freeze will impact only a small portion of the budget, would not kick in until next year, and would include a mix of spending cuts and spending increases. It would have zero impact on the 2010 deficit and little impact on future deficits.
The president has promised to give TARP funds back to taxpayers, but has also proposed applying unspent TARP money to community bank lending — another lost deficit-reduction opportunity.
The president supports “pay as you go” rules for Congress — requiring new spending to be balanced against spending cuts or revenue increases. But the devil is in the details. If the rules have no truly sharp teeth, they will be ineffective.
My view: If the deficit was just $200 billion or even $300 billion, I might support and even applaud these small steps.
But in the context of back-to-back $1.4 trillion deficits and in the face of a looming bond market collapse, they represent barely more than too-little-too-late tinkering.
The Consequence of This Complacency Is Catastrophe
Sadly, although most advisors on the Obama team are now more conscious of the rising political tide against Washington bailouts and deficits, they not yet see the approaching tsunami arriving from Greece.
Money and Markets' Mike Larson explains the situation this way:
“Imagine what would happen if Uncle Sam's borrowing costs shot up like they have in Greece — by 60 percent! Imagine what that would mean for the cost of car loans, mortgages, and other products whose rates track Treasury yields! And imagine the impact on an economy still struggling to recover from the Great Recession! This is the next big story that few people are talking about.”
He's right and they have been warning about it tirelessly.
But, alas, unless the Obama administration and Congress can somehow ax the budget or find a new gusher of revenues — both extremely unlikely anytime soon — collapsing U.S. bond prices and sharply higher long-term interest rates are unavoidable.
Like we saw during the contagions of 1997-98 and 2007-09 …
Confidence in vulnerable investments — this time, long-term U.S. government securities — will suddenly collapse. Then, it was certain geographical regions or market niches. Now it's threatening the CORE of our national essence.
Investors will yank their money out in great haste …
The avalanche of selling will drive ALL bond prices — government, corporate, and municipal — into an uncontrollable swan dive. And …
The contagion will spread to any country on the planet that has the same obvious vulnerability to the disease — massive federal deficits.
There is, however, one outstanding silver lining in this new crisis: Sinking government bond prices — bringing surging costs for government borrowing — are the single most powerful market mechanisms for persuading governments to end their print-and-spend madness.
Provided we don't fall again for the false promises of politicians — and provided we are willing, as a nation, to make the needed sacrifices — there IS still hope for America.
That's one reason I don't recommend you abandon the safety of Treasury securities. Rather, all along, I've made it clear the real concern is not with ALL Treasury securities. It's strictly with longer term Treasuries.
The other reason is that shorter term Treasury notes (under a couple of years in maturity) are far, far less vulnerable than the longer term variety.
And U.S. Treasury bills (always shorter than one year) suffer virtually no price declines, even in the midst of a bond market collapse.
So stick with them. Yes, I know. Their yield is miserably low. But they still provide the world's best safety and liquidity.
Just make sure you avoid all longer term notes and bonds — whether government-issued or not. When the market price of bonds declines, so does your principal value. And because of that loss in principal, any extra interest they might pay you could be wiped out in a heartbeat.
Good luck and God bless!

After sending notices to five companies for failing to timely complete construction on Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) plots, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has failed to recover its Rs 3,000 crore dues, alleged RTI activist Anil Galgali.
Advertising
“The MMRDA, which is headed by the CM, is rapidly losing its sting and authority as can be understood from its abject failure to recover its own dues amounting to Rs 3,000 crore. Of the total outstanding amount, 95 per cent is to be recovered from Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries Limited (RIL),” said Galgali.
Earlier in August, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) had accused MMRDA of showing undue leniency towards RIL. The company was asked to pay additional premium after they failed to complete work on the two plots allotted to them in 2007.
MMRDA had issued notices to five companies on September 12 asking them to pay the dues within 15 days.
Among the other defaulters, Jamnalal Hirachand Ambani Foundation owes MMRDA Rs 31 crore, Indian Newspaper Society Rs 105.26 crore, M/s Naman Hotels outstanding Rs 32 crore, Talim Research Foundation Rs 33 crore, Income Tax department Rs 1 crore, and Oriental Bank of Commerce Rs 25 crore. “The MMRDA officers have surrendered before the high and mighty defaulters thereby failing to recover its dues and further failing to perform their duties. The MMRDA should stop work at the defaulters projects and should revoke the Occupation Certificates to ensure the recovery of the dues, but sadly the defaulters in connivance of MMRDA officers are causing losses to the government treasury,” added Galgali.

MMRDA spokesperson Dilip Kawathkar said, “We have already sent the notices and appropriate action will be taken against these firms.”
The top two prospects for this year's CFL draft, as determined by the league's scouting bureau, are University of Iowa Hawkeyes receiver Tevaun Smith and University of Manitoba Bisons defensive lineman David Onyemata.
However, being the most talented player available may actually hurt your draft position.
If a player is that talented, they will likely garner attention from pro scouts on both sides of the border — and it has been about 40 years since the CFL could compete with the NFL in terms of player compensation.
CFL teams that are deciding who to choose with their first-round draft pick on May 10 want to know if, or when, they will see that player in camp.
If that player is drafted or signed by an NFL team, it could be months, if not years, before they show up on their doorstep.
Also consider that Smith and any of the other Canadians who earn NCAA scholarships are trained in the American game. Although there are similarities between Canadian and American football, different skill sets are required.
Whether it's the waggle, the defensive pass interference rules, the 12th man, the larger field, the kicking tee or the distance between the linemen on the line of scrimmage, there are differences between the games and the players must adjust.
Many of the skills are transferrable, but mastery of the details and nuances of the game make the difference between a collegiate star and a professional athlete.
It is the scouts' responsibility to guess which players will be able to make the transition and to identify those who will not fit as well into the Canadian game.
There are also CIS athletes, such as Onyemata, to consider.
The CIS and CFL rule books are essentially one and the same, but if you watch a CIS game it will be hard not to notice the calibre and speed of the play — or lack thereof.
As a player who excelled and was drafted out of the Canadian college ranks, when I arrived at my first CFL training camp I thought I was in the wrong place.
There were a lot more X's and O's to digest, and things on the field were happening so fast that I could hardly get out of my three-point stance.
Add to this the overwhelming upgrade in calibre of opponent and I was left wondering whether this was in fact the same game I had received accolades for only a few months earlier. CIS athletes have to adapt their accustomed style of play to the new pro game or find other employment.
One question for scouts to consider regarding CIS athletes is very similar to the one that applies to NCAA players. How will their style of play fit into the CFL game?
And will they even be available?
There's something to be said about having first dibs on the best Canadian-born players — and the Saskatchewan Roughriders do have the first overall selection in the 2016 draft — but I'm far too conservative to bet a bundle on the top pick.
As a fifth-round selection myself, I believe there is more certainty and value to be had in the later rounds.

Grants, N.M. — Horrifying video, exposed through a new lawsuit shows an inmate begging to be taken to the hospital as they violently throw up blood — all the while, prison officers stand by and simply watch them die.
For seven hours, Douglas Edminsten writhed in agony as blood spewed from their mouth. Instead of getting the dying man the help they were begging for, prison officers sadistically stood by and watched them die.
“It made me sick to my stomach,” said attorney Glenn Valdez, after seeing the video for the first time. “I'm watching somebody die right in front of my eyes.”
As KOB reports, Edminsten suffered for seven hours, and at some points they appeared to be unconscious. The other inmates were so scared for them that they read Bible passages and even formed a prayer circle.
“We know the inmates and everyone else were trying to get help, but nothing happened,” Valdez said. “He couldn't call themselves or do anything that we take for granted. So without the guards to call, he's dead.”
When an autopsy was conducted, examiners found that Edminsten had a ruptured blood vessel in their stomach which led to their death. According to the report, their abdomen was full of blood. Had the jail officers taken them to the hospital when they asked for them to, they would've had an 80 percent chance of living.
What's more, Valdez says that prison officers allowed Edminsten to die so that they didn't have to pay the medical expense of bringing them to a doctor.
“I think it was a financial decision that they didn't want to pay to take them to a hospital,” they said.
According to KOB, because of the pending litigation, county officials weren't able to say much about the incident when KOB reached out for comment. They did say that policies at the jail were being reviewed, but there have been no changes yet.
The Cibola County manager also said was an external investigation of Edminsten's death, but they would not reveal the conclusions of that.
As Valdez notes, they were not like someone on the outside of prison. Edminsten couldn't simply call 911 and get help. Instead, they were at the mercy of the Cibola County jail guards — and they showed no mercy.
Edminsten's death is not an isolated incident. In-custody deaths are an all too often tragic occurrence.
Only 48 hours after they made a Facebook post thanking God for their kids, a 35-year-old father of four, Michael Sabbie, died in a concrete cage. Their last moments alive were caught on a jail's surveillance cameras as they uttered the all-too-familiar phrase ‘I can't breathe' — 19 times — as cops ignored him.
Somer Nunnally, a mother of two, was arrested on suspicion of DUI in May of 2015. They had ingested some pills and had a bad reaction to them. They were then booked into the Mississippi County jail where they would die a slow and humiliating death — all as guards watched and laughed for their own amusement
Neither Nunnally nor Sabbie had been convicted of a crime. In fact, according to a report released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, an overwhelming amount of inmates who die in police custody haven't been convicted of a crime.
An alarming 75% of the people who die behind bars actually have not been convicted of a crime.
As we have seen with the cases of Sandra Bland, Rexdale Henry, Sarah Circle Bear, and others, many of the deaths that occur in prison happen under extremely suspicious circumstances and are labeled as “suicides” without proper investigation.
As the video above illustrates, the problem doesn't seem to be getting any better.
Public-health officials have settled their smoking-ban case against Medina Hookah Lounge in Seattle, which could pave the way for Mayor Ed Murray to come to terms with such businesses that they at one point vowed to shut down.
Public-health officials settled their case against a Seattle hookah lounge Friday, clearing the way for Mayor Ed Murray to end their clash with owners of other similar businesses.
Last August, Murray said they would move to shutter all 11 of the city's hookah lounges for violating a state ban on indoor smoking in public places and places of employment. They linked the businesses to violent crime, including the fatal shooting of Chinatown International District community leader Donnie Chin near one such lounge.
Then dozens of lounge owners and hookah smokers, along with other supporters, showed up at City Council meetings to protest the mayor's plan, calling it discrimination against businesses run by people of East African and Middle Eastern descent.
So Murray backed off, saying they would enter talks with the owners and use the city's Racial Equity Toolkit process to analyze the community impacts of closing the lounges.
The mayor sent an analysis to the council in February, saying they would hold off on more talks with the owners until after a judge's ruling in Public Health — Seattle & King County's smoking-ban case against Medina Hookah Lounge. That's the case that settled Friday.
Under the agreement, which waives more than $100,000 in penalties against Medina, the lounge must take steps to operate strictly as a private club, with a secured entrance, no advertising, no alcohol, no more than 2,500 members and no paid employees.
Before settling, Medina argued it was already a members-only club, but public-health officials contended it wasn't. Russell Knight, lawyer for the lounge, said their client has agreed to make Medina “more private” in return for officials dropping the case.
The agreement is based on how members-only cigar lounges are allowed to operate in Seattle and King County without violating the smoking ban, Knight said.
The lawyer said they believe Medina's agreement will smooth a path for public-health officials and Murray to make peace with other Seattle hookah lounges.
“I think this will guide the way the county treats the other lounges,” Knight said. “My sense is that these terms are going to be what the city adopts … as well.”
The agreement applies to Medina only and the judge in the case has yet to sign a dismissal order, so the case is technically still active, said James Apa, spokesperson for Public Health — Seattle & King County.
The agency “remains committed to enforcing smoking laws, which help protect against tobacco smoke — the leading cause of preventable death in the United States,” Apa said.
The mayor on Friday called Medina's agreement encouraging.
“It mirrors our discussions this winter and provides an example of a private-club model exempt from the state smoking ban that is acceptable to Seattle — King County Public Health,” Murray said.
They said the city soon will resume talks with the lounge owners.
There has been no arrest in the Chin homicide. Murray convened a task force late last year to address crime in the Chinatown ID, asking for recommendations this month.

They knew themselves a villain—but they deem'd
The rest no better than the thing they seem'd;
And scorn'd the best as hypocrites who hid
Those deeds the bolder spirit plainly did.
They knew themselves detested, but they knew
The hearts that loath'd him, crouch'd and dreaded too.
Lone, wild, and strange, they stood alike exempt
From all affection and from all contempt
Lord Byron, The Corsair
Dirk Strider isn't just the Byronic hero we need. He's the Byronic hero we deserve.
The Byronic hero, for reference, is the ultimate incarnation of the anti-hero. You've seen them (and they do tend to be male); a self-absorbed, arrogant, intense social outcast of the most sexually enticing order. Just a quick trip to the “Dirk Strider” or “Bro Strider” tags will show you a perfect image of what I'm talking about.
Even before Dirk's introduction, it was made clear that they were emphatically not like the other Alpha Kids/Beta guardians. Where Nanna was informative but generally passive, Grandpa was taxidermized or might as well have been, and Mom Lalonde spent most of their time as teen angst fuel for their daughter's dark descent, Bro Strider was painted from the very beginning as an ubermensch, both by Dave's fear-tinged admiration and by Bro's own impossibly heroic abilties. Before they had a name, we knew Dirk was a lion among men.
Their post-Scratch introduction page is more than obliging in reinforcing Dirk's nature as an unattainable standard of hypermasculine perfection: in addition to having all the brute strength of the athlete (Dirk's sparring regimen, after all, is identical to that of Equius), Dirk is startlingly intelligent, programming robots and, despite living across the ocean from the only other human to live for centuries, has amassed a working knowledge of centuries-old pop culture, ancient history, and engineering.  They are both physically and intellectually superhuman.
These traits alone, though, are not enough to make Dirk the compelling character they are. It's not difficult to be fantastically strong or intelligent in fiction; most protagonists in all fiction are some mixture, though typically diluted, of both. The traits that make Hussie's Byronic hero so great are two less common ones.
First, and more common of the two, Dirk's traits are concentrated. If Batman is a “Marty Stu”, Dirk is the patron deity of self-insert fanfiction. Dirk is hyperbolic in their every quality: fast enough to move objects without seeming to change position, strategic, capable of programming their own personality into a computer. This isn't in and of itself particularly special; polymathic tendencies are par for the course in Byronic heroes, although it bears repeating that Dirk's degree is less so. There is a difference between being impressive and being a demigod; Dirk falls much closer to the latter.
It's the second of Dirk's special traits that really makes them shine, and that is their externalization of self. Dirk doesn't view themselves in the first person, so to speak—he sees all their actions through the conscious lens of an outside observer, which allows them the unique privilege of being both the insufferable hero and one of the people that despises him. The self-hate they show is honest, and so is the confidence. The same child who wrote “The Prince is awake. Your shit is wrecked.” built an AI that treats them exactly how they would like to be treated: like garbage.
Dirk is unable to stand their own personality, but they consider themselves unable to change it without an act of self-destruction. This is where the true genius of the Prince of Heart title comes into play. As a “destroyer of souls”, Dirk is of course capable of doing so to those of other people, but more often and more successfully, they do it to himself. This is reflected not just in their desire to destroy the AR, but their current glitch-enabled solipsism and their endless rants in Trickster mode.
And yet, despite all these qualities, despite their self-absorption and abusive behavior, Dirk manages to work in some common humanity, best exemplified in their platonic love for Roxy Lalonde but also shown in the Crypt Bed conversations just after the Trickster episode, when they admitted that he'd been wrong, both in their opinion of Jake and the way they treated him. They aren't perfect, but shows signs of a new character path: the Byronic hero turned straight.
No, not that kind of straight.
Dirk is showing signs of developing a new moral code, one revolving around being the same powerhouse he's always been, only without the grievous harm to their personal relationships. Acknowledging their mistakes in a way that doesn't make them harm himself, and admitting that the fault in others isn't theirs to fix—these are steps Dirk is taking to go from the stylish abuser they were as Bro to the hero they were always meant to be.
Is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable? This is often a hotly debated topic, but biologically speaking, there is a very simple answer to it. A simple understanding of what is a fruit, and what is a vegetable helps us easily classify pretty much all fruits and vegetables.
What is a fruit? What is a vegetable?
A fruit is the mature ovary of a seed bearing plant. All other edible plant parts including leaves, roots and stems, are vegetables.
So how do you differentiate a fruit from a vegetable?
The easiest way to tell if something you're having is a fruit or a vegetable is to see if it contains seeds or not. If it contains seeds, it's a fruit. If it doesn't, it's a vegetable.
Therefore, tomato is definitely a fruit. So are apples, peaches, melons, papayas and grapes. Cucumbers, peas, beans, pumpkins, capsicums, peppers, etc. are also fruits even though they are culinarily often treated as vegetables.
Meanwhile potatoes, carrots, lettuce, spinach, broccoli, cauliflowers, etc. are all vegetables.
We first reported about the Galaxy S6 Iron Man Edition earlier this month when Samsung merely confirmed that it would be releasing a version of the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 edge based on this Marvel superhero. At that time the company said that this version will be released either at the end of May or in early June as it had to nail down some details with Marvel first before the Iron Man Edition could be brought to the market. Iron Man fans won't have to wait for too long to see how this version looks because Samsung is going to unveil it next week.
Samsung has confirmed through its official Facebook page that the Galaxy S6 Iron Man Edition is “coming next week,” the announcement was made in the form of a post on the Facebook page accompanied by a picture that just offers a glimpse of this new version. Details about availability and price will certainly be provided once Samsung officially unveils it, so far it has chosen not to talk about those things. It's unclear right now if Samsung plans to sell this version in all markets or if it will only be available in selected markets, we'll find out for sure soon enough.

Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia will occupy a bungalow that once used to be the official residence of then Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit.
Union Urban Development Ministry today approved transfer of the bungalow No. AB-17 on Mathura Road to Delhi government for allotment to Sisodia.
Delhi government had made a request for transfering the bungalow to it and it has been done on exchange basis, a senior UD Ministry official said.
The Mathura Road bungalow is lying vacant since it was vacated recently by former Union Minister P Balaram Naik.
Dikshit, as Chief Minister, used to stay at the bungalow which is located just opposite Pragati Maidan for years before moving to bigger accommodation -- 3, Motilal Nehru Place.
At the same time, Delhi government is yet to seek bungalow accommodation for Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the UD ministry official said.
A month ago, more precisely on August 13th, we saw a pretty interesting teaser image with just a couple of hours before the Unpacked 2015 start. Unfortunately, this device wasn't launched in that press event, following that two weeks later to emerge again in some high-quality pictures.
Well, today we have the chance to know more about this product, device called Samsung Galaxy View. As you can see in the screenshot below, the tablet in case, just arrived in India in order to be tested before its possible commercial release. 10 of these tablets were imported in India on September 11th, with a $457 price tag per unit.
A detail revealed by this image is the fact that the tablet is called SM-W700, and that W might offer a suggestion regarding a possible Windows 10 slate, and not to an Android-enabled device. In the same time is rumored that Galaxy View will pack a 12-inch QHD or 4K display, 4 GB of RAM memory, and an Intel Core M processor. A S-Pen stylus will be on-board of the 600 grams tablet that seems to measure just 6.2 mm in thickness.
"The Last One Standing is not merely my favorite Star Wars piece; that's a limited universe. It's one of my favorite pieces of writing, overall. I went back to Harrison Ford's comment about Solo: 'no mama, no papa, and no story.' And I gave Han Solo a last moment in the sun, got the wife and kids away from him, got Chewie away from him, and sent them off to have an adventure by himself, to put them on the field with another old horse, Boba Fett, for one last confrontation." ―Daniel Keys Moran
"The Last One Standing: The Tale of Boba Fett" is a short story written by Daniel Keys Moran and published by Bantam Spectra in the Tales of the Bounty Hunters anthology. It focuses on bounty hunter Boba Fett, though also features passages written from the point of view of war criminal Kardue'sai'Malloc and Han Solo, former smuggler and hero of the Rebellion. The early portions of the book deal with a number of incidents in Boba Fett's early life, documenting their fixation on and rivalry with Han Solo, and establishing much of their background. After jumping time frames a number of time the story reaches 19 ABY and stays there for its duration. After an older Fett successfully captures Kardue'sai'Malloc, the Butcher of Montellian Serat, to pay for their retirement, they and their old nemesis Solo end up facing off on Jubilar, where they first met. The story ends in a cliffhanger, with each man pointing a gun at the other from a close range.
The story had received mixed reaction since its publication in 1996. Some fans believe Moran's portrayal of Fett is too emotional and human for an antagonist, but it is considered by many to be the best Star Wars short story, while published Star Wars authors Kevin J. Anderson and Abel G. Peña rank it highly. Boba Fett's backstory as established by "The Last One Standing" was originally considered canon, but it was superseded with the release of Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, which made Fett a clone of their father. Jango Fett: Open Seasons and the New Essential Guide to Characters fixed this problem with a number of retcons, and while it is still canon, "The Last One Standing" has been marginalized by a number of other works, both in terms of in-universe historical details and in terms of Fett's characterization.

Production Edit
"I wrote three-Star Wars stories for Kevin J. Anderson, back in the mid-late 90s. I'm proud of them: I did my best with them. They were stupid in places…But I did what, to my understanding at least, Lucas had done with Star Wars: hid the stupidity beneath sheer force of conviction, and charged ahead. And I think it worked." ―Daniel Keys Moran, author of "The Last One Standing"
In the mid 1990s, Star Wars author Kevin J. Anderson conceived the idea of compiling anthologies of short stories centered around various background characters appearing in the Star Wars saga,[2] whose backstory had by-and-large only been touched upon by West End Games sourcebooks.[3][4][5] Publisher Bantam Spectra and Lucasfilm's Director of Publishing Lucy Wilson were enthusiastic about the idea,[2] and Anderson set about inviting various authors, some of whom had prior experience working in the Star Wars universe, to pen stories for the first anthology, Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina. It covered many characters seen fleetingly in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope in sixteen short stories.[6][7] Among the invitees was Daniel Keys Moran, author of the Bantam-published Continuing Time series, who had been recommended to Anderson by Heather McConnell, Moran's partner and an editor at Bantam.[7] Moran penned Empire Blues: The Devaronian's Tale, basing the story around Kathy Tyers' contribution to the project, We Don't Do Weddings: The Band's Tale.[8] Anderson was impressed by Moran's submission,[7] and it was approved by Lucasfilm, with minor changes such as the removal of the word "whores."[9] The anthology was eventually published in August, 1995,[10] over ten months after the idea was approved by Lucasfilm.[2]
A second anthology, Tales from Jabba's Palace, was approved soon after the first, and Moran was again invited by Kevin J. Anderson to contribute towards it by authoring a story about Boba Fett, who appeared in both Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back and Episode VI Return of the Jedi. Attracted by the "strong, silent, brutal" character of Fett, Moran agreed, and turned in an outline for a story depicting what happened to Fett after they fell into the sarlacc in Return of the Jedi. Moran's outline established that the sarlacc was self-aware, and that Fett spent many years in its bowels before their escape; it was initially approved. However, Lucasfilm later requested that Moran change the story to make Fett stay in the sarlacc just a few days, and that it could not be sentient as they wished.[7] Moran revised it until Lucasfilm was satisfied but they were unhappy with the final product and opted to use a pseudonym—J. D. Montgomery—despite the wishes of Lucasfilm. No Star Wars author had previously used a pseudonym with Bantam, but Moran insisted that they either publish the revised piece with the pseudonym or publish the original submission without it. In the anthology's "About the Authors" appendix, the issue of the pseudonym was jestingly glossed over, with the piece stating that J.D. Montgomery "does not exist…not really." The story, A Barve Like That: The Tale of Boba Fett, was published in January, 1996. Relations between Lucasfilm and Moran were strained and they doubted they would get an opportunity to write for Kevin J. Anderson's final collection, Tales of the Bounty Hunters.[8]
Anderson, however, was keen to use Moran as one of the four authors aside from themselves to work on the third anthology. They contacted Moran and asked them to pen the Boba Fett story. Daniel Keys Moran was surprised by Anderson's offer, knowing that it could generate friction between Anderson and Lucasfilm and that it was something of a gamble on their part. Moran suspected that Anderson themselves knew it wasn't in their best interests to offer them the job, which they admired.[8] After clarifying with Anderson that they would get to write without undue interference from Lucasfilm, Moran accepted and began to work on an outline.[7] Their short story would take place over various periods in Fett's life: when they were exiled from their homeworld; their first meeting with Han Solo during one of their early missions as a bounty hunter; a brief recounting of the events in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi; a mission, fifteen years after Return of the Jedi, which is to provide Fett with a hefty retirement fund; and a showdown with their old nemesis, Han Solo, shortly after. They also settled on the title "The Last One Standing," which was never changed.[8]
After finishing their outline, Moran decided that if Lucasfilm was unhappy with any substantial part of it, they would not write the story and would request that someone else be found to take their place—this was made easier by the fact that there was little money involved in the anthologies to such an extent that, according to Moran, they were essentially writing the stories out of love for the Star Wars franchise. They turned in their outline to Anderson and told them their thoughts on the matter; Anderson liked the outline and told Moran to write the story. They promised to protect it from any major changes by Lucasfilm, and Moran set about working on their first draft.[8]
Moran enjoyed writing the story, and it became one of their favorite self-authored works. They kept in contact with Kevin J. Anderson while writing it—after writing the scene in which Kardue'sai'Malloc is put to death in a pit of starving, vicious quarra, they sent Anderson a letter telling him, "When I'm old and have sons, I will tell them, 'Daddy was bad once.'" After finishing their first draft, Moran sent it to Anderson who in turn sent it to Lucasfilm.[8] Some minor changes were made, particularly to some of the harsh language, with "hell" and "damn" specifically being removed despite appearing in the films and many Expanded Universe works since. The town on Jubilar mentioned in the story was originally called "Halfway to Hell" and later "Hell," but were changed to "Dying Slowly" and "Death." Moran would have preferred the changes weren't made, but had no real qualms about them and didn't object. At another point, a segment of one line in the story was removed: "If this is Han, buddy, you owe me five hundreds credits if I get back, you've been betting on the slow ones lately" was changed to simply, "If this is Han, buddy, you owe me five hundreds credits if I get back," with no explanation of why. The change annoyed Moran but they again made no issue about it.[9]
However, Lucasfilm did have a major issue with Kardue'sai'Malloc's death scene. An individual at LFL hated the scene and did not want it included in the final product under any circumstances. Moran and Lucasfilm corresponded over the issue, during which the scene was referred to by LFL as "the torture scene." However, Anderson honored their promise to Moran and the scene stayed in, with no changes.[8] The story was finally given the all-green and published along with four others in Tales of the Bounty Hunters.
Continuity Edit
Originally this story was considered to be the official background story for Boba Fett, but when Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones was released, its depiction of Fett's childhood contradicted the Jaster Mereel backstory.
Jango Fett: Open Seasons retconned the Jaster Mereel character to be a different individual: the mentor of Fett's father, Jango Fett. Boba Fett took Jaster's name as an alias during their time as a Journeyman Protector, thus saving the story from being apocryphal.

Last month's release of the National Strategy for Counterterrorism has brought much joy to many foreign policy liberals. Finally, the ghosts of the Bush administration have been exorcised. Finally, the president speaks of law and allies instead of war and an “axis of evil.” Coupled with the recent announcement of a timetable to end combat operations in Afghanistan, liberals have taken heart at the apparent shift in national security strategy. Such sentiments are understandable given the foreign policy quagmire of the past decade.
And yet, those who laud the new announcement as a fundamental realignment fail to realize that the self-limitations on the part of the United States are, in many cases, vast expansions in authorization for the use of force against “ungoverned spaces.” The symbol of this expansion of power is the predator drone, which will police these ungoverned spaces by surgical strikes of unlimited scope.
Drones are the perfect weapons for the post-Cold War world of globalization that has radically compressed our notions of time and space and made a formerly predictable international environment chaotic. Drones, which can move with speed across vast geographic spaces, are the ultimate tool for a global police officer who aspires to maintain order over vast distances. As such, the new American strategy is both a dramatic departure from and a culmination of the Pentagon's post-Cold War strategic paradigm.
The Age of No Limits
President Obama's letter that prefaces the document is a message of limits. Whereas the previous regime took an overly belligerent policy of invasion and world transformation, the United States will shift to an approach organized around “concrete, realistic goals.” The most important of these goals is insisting that al-Qaeda is the enemy- a shift long requested by policy advocates. It begs the question, however, of defining al-Qaeda. If al-Qaeda operates not just in Afghanistan and Pakistan but also in Yemen and in Iraq, and has even spawned, as one French diplomat said, al-Qaeda franchises, targeting al-Qaeda does not serve to limit U.S. missions. The document indeed adds organizations linked ideologically to al-Qaeda but points out that they will nonetheless not be conflated with the latter.
Furthermore, the actual theaters of combat described in the document are widely dispersed. The Defense Department reserves the right to attack in North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Central, Western, and South Asia. Obama has retired the phrase “global war on terror” and announced in 2008 that the Iraq War was ending. But the administration has increased the use of predator drones specifically in Iraq. Surgical strikes are, in the long-term, potentially worse than previous counter-terrorism efforts. The devastation of war is ostensibly limited to one territory and runs up against public disgust over the death of U.S. soldiers. The low-intensity nature of predator drones and their ease of moment make the future of warfare potentially timeless and spaceless. The lack of U.S. casualties also shields the attacks from public opinion.
Drones are not simply a tactic, a tool of warcraft. They are strategic instruments that change the very nature of war and the geopolitical context in which war is embedded. They militarize global social spaces in a qualitatively new manner.
Controlling Time and Space
Since the end of the Cold War, the Pentagon's strategy has been to police “ungoverned spaces” that are breeding grounds for anti-systemic forces. The future is not interstate warfare. Rather, the Pentagon focuses on various displaced peoples– the “losers” of globalization — whose grievances translate into conflict. The past 30 years of globalization have seen a dramatic transformation in how peoples experience space and time. Instead of more-or-less stable and predictable social spaces and temporal existence, there is constant flux. The familiar world of states has become more like a network of “global cities” such as New York and London in which wealth and power have been concentrated surrounded by vast zones of poverty which constitute what Mike Davis calls the “planet of the slums.”
This matrix is far from stable, however, as the financial crisis has proven. States that aspire to police the globe, to maintain order in a disorderly environment, face a core problem: the old wars of position, the old strategies of realpolitik, and the old tactics of tank battles and nuclear deterrence no longer apply. Through a technological fix, drones solve what has been a decades-long strategic dilemma within military circles. Our conceptions of time and space have changed dramatically, and this is why predator drones are more than a mere tactic. The decision to move away from ground troops and land invasions is not part of a “progressive” move away from aggressive foreign policy but logical accommodation to a globalized world of disorder.
In the end, the National Strategy for Counterterrorism of June 2011 puts drones at the center of U.S. policy. The drone is increasingly the symbol of a world that is not so much flat as full of new walls that attempt to contain disorder. The new face of state violence is the drone moving silently through the slum.

In a lengthy, harrowing post on their Facebook today, Larkin Grimm accused their onetime collaborator, Swans' Michael Gira, of rape and sexual harassment. “My story with Michael Gira is an absolute tragedy that I have kept secret for too long,” Grimm writes, continuing, saying the incident happened in 2008 while making the album Parplar which was produced by Gira and released on their Young God label:
In the spring of 2008, on the night that we finished recording Parplar at Trout Recordings with Bryce Goggin, we went out to eat at a steakhouse. My friend Johnny Dido was our waiter. We were with Michael's friends and they were drinking heavily and encouraging me to keep up with them. I'm a pretty lightweight drinker. At the end of the night it became obvious that I was too drunk to drive home, too drunk to even walk straight. Michael invited me to stay with their friends. They said they had a bed for me and that Michael would sleep on the floor. I trusted them and agreed. At the apartment of Michael's friends, I crawled into bed without changing my clothes or brushing my teeth. I just passed out. A little later Michael woke me up coughing. They had bad asthma, and sleeping on the floor in the dust was aggravating it. I told him, slurred, half asleep, that they could sleep in the bed, just not to touch me. A little bit later I woke up with their penis inside me, no condom. As I opened my eyes, they said, “Uh, this doesn't feel right.” and they pulled out.
Grimm said they spent the following six months in a suicidal depression, and was creatively blocked for many years after, but continued their working relationship though had to fend off further incidents. When they finally confronted Gira about it, Grimm says they dropped them from Young God. “It took me a long time to admit that to myself. Years. Michael Gira, my producer, raped me and dumped me from their label when I confronted them about it, needing to feel safe,” they wrote.
UPDATE: Michael Gira denies rape accusation
Earlier in the day Grimm also took to Facebook to tell a similar story about Thomas Sayers Ellis of their now ex-band Heroes are Gang Leaders. They reference that story about Thomas, an African American man, in their posting about Gira (“He's a white guy”):
I will give you some history about why I am sharing the story about Thomas Sayers Ellis's abusive behavior now. I didn't always stand up for myself. Rape is a loaded word. No man wants to be a rapist. It implies cowardice as well as violence. It undermines the sexual power and magnetism that every man would like to have. No woman wants to be known as a rape victim, either. I want to be known for my strength, intelligence, and talent. Not known as a victim. My story with Michael Gira is an absolute tragedy that I have kept secret for too long. I am only speaking of it now because after being accused of “lynching” Thomas, I cannot ethically keep Michael's secret any longer. He's a white guy, and their crime was far worse than what Thomas did to me or Margaret.
In the comments of the Gira post, Grimm says they finally decided to write about the Gira incident when Extra Life/Psalm Zero's Charlie Looker, condemned their bandmate Andrew Hock's behavior, saying “I have no desire to hurt MG.  They are the type of person who punishes themselves pretty harshly anyway. But it made me sick every time another rape or harassment story came out, that I was keeping this secret.”

POST 1:
Please share this with anyone who has experienced harassment in the music world. I experienced a traumatic incidence of sexual harassment in my band Heroes are Gang Leaders on February 6th and 7th. The band leader, Thomas Sayers Ellis, threatened to hurt me further if I called them out publicly, so I have spent the last few weeks thinking it over, looking at my options. Many cases like this have been shared on Facebook and Twitter lately. I do not believe in Facebook witch hunts or mob justice, and that is why I decided to take this issue to a government agency that is supposed to protect women from sexual harassment and assault in the workplace. It turns out musicians cannot file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission because we are freelancers. Maybe this is why rape, assault, and sexual harassment are so common in the music world. The representative of the EEOC, who I spoke to at length, said, “It's true. This is an unfair situation for musicians and other freelancers. You are being left out in the cold as far as justice is concerned. I urge you to get a group together, contact your member of congress, your senator, and see if there is anything you can do to help us protect women like yourself.” Twitter justice is not justice, y'all. I saw this man, whose sexual advances I had been calmly brushing off for months, abuse their girlfriend in front of 12 band members at Rutgers University in Newark on the night of february 6th. I went to speak to them afterwards wondering if they had gone insane. This was a man I loved and admired. The next day, I was publicly humiliated in front of our audience at The Firehouse in Brooklyn on February 7th right before the show, verbally abused and threatened, and kicked out of a band that I loved. Both these events had many, many witnesses. What I would often say to Thomas and to Devin Waldman, my ex who was also in the band and contributed to a hostile work environment, was, “Please, please just let me do my job. Stop hitting on me and let me do my job. I am good at this job.”
I must add that retaliation was threatened if I shared this story, so if you read any crazy things about me understand that this is an attempt to undermine my credibility as a victim. Under U.S. law I would be protected from retaliation under EEOC rules if I were considered an employee of Thomas Sayers Ellis or Fast-Speaking Music, but because of the way this field works, I have no protection against this. Nobody is perfect and please remember your personal experience with me and my work before believing any harmful nonsense or judging my character.

I will give you some history about why I am sharing the story about Thomas Sayers Ellis's abusive behavior now. I didn't always stand up for myself. Rape is a loaded word. No man wants to be a rapist. It implies cowardice as well as violence. It undermines the sexual power and magnetism that every man would like to have.

I am only speaking of it now because after being accused of “lynching” Thomas, I cannot ethically keep Michael's secret any longer. He's a white guy, and their crime was far worse than what Thomas did to me or Margaret. Michael Gira and I had a beautiful, fruitful collaboration on my album Parplar. They were my record label boss and producer. They were my beloved, trusted mentor, really my guru. I lived in their house with them and their wife Siobhan and I babysat their daughter frequently in between working on new songs and incorporating Michael's valuable input. I loved them more than I have loved just about anyone, but I did not want to have sex with him, and I made that very clear over and over. In the spring of 2008, on the night that we finished recording Parplar at Trout Recordings with Bryce Goggin, we went out to eat at a steakhouse. My friend Johnny Dido was our waiter. We were with Michael's friends and they were drinking heavily and encouraging me to keep up with them. I'm a pretty lightweight drinker. At the end of the night it became obvious that I was too drunk to drive home, too drunk to even walk straight. Michael invited me to stay with their friends. They said they had a bed for me and that Michael would sleep on the floor. I trusted them and agreed. At the apartment of Michael's friends, I crawled into bed without changing my clothes or brushing my teeth. I just passed out. A little later Michael woke me up coughing. They had bad asthma, and sleeping on the floor in the dust was aggravating it. I told him, slurred, half asleep, that they could sleep in the bed, just not to touch me. A little bit later I woke up with their penis inside me, no condom. As I opened my eyes, they said, “Uh, this doesn't feel right.” and they pulled out. The next morning, Michael begged me not to tell their wife about what happened. I drove home, numb. Then I took my bike around the block and got hit by a car, injuring my hip. That day I wrote one of my best songs, “The Butcher, or Without a Body or a Numb and Useless Mind.” It was the last song I would be able to write for a few years. I spent the next 6 months in a suicidal depression. Michael would call frequently to talk about the progress on my record and to talk dirty to me. They would tell me they loved me and that they would leave their wife for me. I would refuse to talk dirty to them and try to bring the conversation back to business. When we met, the interactions were often sexually charged and I would squirm out of them as best I could. We never had sex again although they tried over and over, making me absolutely miserable. Mastering the record with Fred Kevorkian was particularly difficult. Michael took the opportunity to kiss me in the elevator, and I complied because I really, really, really wanted to be a successful musician. He'd often say to me, “I'm gonna make you a star, Larkin. You can trust me.” I stuck with this pattern for a long time, through my record release and the tours (with Michael!!) supporting it, but when it came time to write a new record, I found my creativity was totally blocked. I told Michael that they had had sex with me against my will and that I didn't feel safe with them any more. They then dropped me from Young God Records. Many people have assumed, over the years, that Michael and I had a love affair, and in a way, for a time, maybe we did. But I never consented to having sex with him. I wouldn't have wanted to ruin such an important opportunity that way. Technically, they raped me. It took me a long time to admit that to myself. Years. Michael Gira, my producer, raped me and dumped me from their label when I confronted them about it, needing to feel safe.
What happened was awful, but as a prison abolitionist, an anarchist, and a nice person I didn't want to destroy their whole life with a rape charge. Looking back, they didn't think twice about destroying mine. Sending my love to ‪#‎Kesha‬ I know how you feel. At least I got out of my record deal, though I was never offered another one after that.
UPDATE: Michael Gira denies rape accusation
My perspective on JavaScript-based browser extensions has been far too naïve until this point. We were all burned by bad toolbars or evil ActiveX add-ons in the past, so when I run IE I run it with no add-ons enabled, or very few. However, with Google Chrome and it's sync feature, as well as its rich extension store, it's easy to add a bunch of add-ons and get them synced to other machines.
I wanted to download a YouTube video recently so I installed a "U-Tube Downloader" extension. It is highly rated, seemed legit, so I added it. It puts a nice Download button next to any YouTube video. Like greasemonkey script it was there when I needed and it, and out of sight otherwise.
I installed it and forgot about it. So, put a pin in that and read on...
Today I was on my own site and this happened. A video slid onto my page from the right side and started playing. I was gobsmacked. I know this site, I know its code. I know my advertisers. WTH. Where is this coming from?
It's the surfing video there in the lower right corner.
First I knee-jerk emailed my advertiser asking if they were injecting this, then I pulled back and started to Inspect Element.
Looks like there's a supporting iframe, along with an injected div. That div includes JS from "vidible.tv" and the ads are picked from "panoramatech." But that's not all.
There are references to literally a half-dozen other ad-networks and then this, something called RevJet.
Search around and here's the first description of what RevJet is.
Whoa, ok, it's an extension. But which one? Grep for "Rev" in this folder C:\Users\Scott\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions and I my U-Tube one.
Nicest Ad Ever
I particularly like the comment "nicest ad ever."
This extension also injects ads from "Yllix" when I'm on YouTube, and RevJet when elsewhere. Apparently if I set revjetoptout in my local storage, I can get around this. Very NOT intuitive. I saw no options for this extension exposing this.
Worse yet, every once in a while, Kim Kardashian shows up in my New Tab page. Again, there's no way for non-technical relative to figure this out. And it's pretty hard for technical me to figure it out. This is deceptive at best.
Ugh.
Yes, I realize someone put work into this extension, and yes, I realize it was free. However, it wasn't clear that it was going to randomly inject ads into any website without asking. It wasn't clear that the ads were injected by this extension. There was/is no clear way for anyone without the ability to debug this to make it stop. Charge me a $1, but don't reach into webpages I visit and mess with my content without telling me.
I recommend you check out chrome://extensions/ and give each enabled one a good hard look. Consider disabling or uninstalling extensions you may have forgotten about or ones you don't explicitly trust. If you're a dev, consider reading the code within the extensions and make sure you're getting what you expect.
Two conservative Republican senators, two potential paths to the White House. Cruz, who during nine months in office has made at least a half-dozen trips to early-primary states, is riding the wave. Rubio, whose last visit to an early-voting state was Iowa in November, is playing the long game. Their allies dismiss the early polling and argue that letting Cruz be the poster boy for the government shutdown might not be such a bad idea.
Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, a Republican who partnered with Rubio on immigration reform, said Thursday: "You're looking at a snapshot of a couple of days of something. I always felt that Sen. Rubio will benefit from their serious work on a substantive issue, and I still think they will."
Flake added, "Winning the presidency is about winning a general, not just a primary."
Asked why they haven't been more outspoken this week, Rubio said he's "more than happy to share their views" with House Republicans that the health care law will damage the economy and Democrats are to blame for the budget impasse. Rubio said they support the effort by House Republicans to pass short-term funding for veterans, the National Park Service, and the D.C. government.
Rubio joined Cruz during their marathon speech on the Senate floor to show their support.
"People know where I stand on the issue," Rubio said Thursday after leaving a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Iran's nuclear program. "There's not legislative action, there isn't anything happening, there's nothing to speak out on."
That hasn't stopped other prominent conservative Republicans like Cruz, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky from holding court with reporters day after day. Paul hosted a "bipartisan coffee" Thursday on the steps of the Senate that attracted more than a couple dozen reporters and only a handful of elected officials.
"The more you pick a fight with Washington, the better you look out in the country," said Republican consultant David Kochel, who ran Mitt Romney's winning campaign in the 2012 Iowa caucus. "Sen. Cruz has got a hot hand right now with a certain part of the grassroots that is really charged up, but we still have to wait for this to play out. I think in the end Sen. Rubio will get credit from the part of the party that's more interested in making sure things work than these symbolic protests."
American Conservative Union Chairman Al Cardenas, who's known Rubio for more than a decade, said their style is to be more collegial, while Cruz seems to relish confrontations with fellow Republicans worried about the negative fallout from the shutdown. Rubio's relationships with other senators could be valuable if they decide to run for national office.
"You will never see Rubio taking on their colleagues head on," Cardenas said. "That's not a place of comfort for him."
SAN JOSE (CBS SF) — A man seen on security camera video assaulting a 13-year-old girl after forcing their way inside their home has been arrested, according San Jose Police.
The suspect was identified as 31-year-old Mohammad Khaliqi of San Jose. Police said Khaliqi was arrested without incident in the 1400 block of School St. in San Leandro.
Investigators believe Khaliqi is the same person who attempted to sexually assault a woman in the restroom of Mitsuwa Marketplace in San Jose on April 2.
During a press conference Friday, police said Khaliqi lived within walking distance of the 13-year-old. According to investigators, they left their San Jose home in the middle of the night and altered their appearance by shaving their head and their beard when they realized police were looking for him.
On Tuesday, police said Khaliqi followed the 13-year-old girl as they walked home from school.
On the security video footage, a man is seen forcing their way inside the girl's home and grabbing them as they fight back. They then begins to approach them again but abruptly stops and leaves them home.
“He is a sexual predator in my opinion, they are a monster,” said Deputy Police Chief Shawny Williams. “This was a very alarming crime to me and I've been here 22 years.”
They were booked into the Santa Clara County Jail for multiple counts of burglary, attempted sexual assault and false imprisonment.
Anyone with information on the incidents, or any other unreported incident, was urged to contact the San Jose Police Department.

Swedish professor nominates Edward Snowden for the Nobel Peace Prize
Stefan Svallfors, sociology professor at Umeå University, nominated Edward Snowden for the Nobel Peace Prize
Snowden will not be eligible for this year's prize, which will be awarded in December 2013 - but could be considered for 2014
The NSA whistleblower would have a hard time accepting the award, as they have already unsuccessfully applied for asylum in Norway
A sociology professor in Sweden has recommended NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden for the Nobel Peace Prize.
In a letter addressed to the Norwegian Nobel Committee and published in Swedish newspaper Västerbottens-Kuriren , Professor Stefan Svallfors nominated Snowden for their 'heroic effort at great personal cost' shedding light on the expansive cyber-spying conducted by the U.S. National Security Agency.
Because of their bravery, Snowden 'helped to make the world a little bit better and safer,' Svallfors wrote.
Scroll down for full letter
Swedish supporter: Stefan Svallfors, professor of sociology at Umea University, sent a letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee nominating Edward Snowden for the Nobel Peace Prize
A nomination for Snowden would be symbolic because it shows 'that individuals can stand up for fundamental rights and freedoms.'
History: The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to 124 times since 1901
Svallfors compares Snowden's act to the rulings in the Nuremberg trials of 1945 because 'I was just following orders' was not held as a viable excuse for the Nazis who carried out human rights atrocities.
Svallfors also believes this will help the Peace Prize regain some respect it lost after prematurely awarding Barack Obama the award in 2009.
'It would show its willingness to stand up in defense of civil liberties and human rights, even when such a defense [could] be viewed with disfavor by the world's dominant military power.'
But it may be too late for Snowden to receive the award this year.
Nominations for laureates must be postmarked no later than February 1 for consideration in the following December's prizes.
Between the months of March and August the advisers review the short list of candidates.
However, Svallfors' nomination should be taken seriously by the committee for next year's prize.
As a sociology professor at Umeå University, they count as one of the 'qualified' people who can send their nominations to the committee.
These qualified people include: members of national assemblies and governments of states; members of international courts; university rectors; professors of social sciences, history, philosophy, law and theology; directors of peace research institutes and foreign policy institutes; recipients of the prize; board members of organizations that have been awarded the prize; active members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee; former advisers of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.
The Nobel Peace Prize was started in 1901 and has been awarded to 100 individuals and 24 organizations.
Qualified: As a professor of sociology at Umeå University in Sweden, Svallfors is one of the few that are allowed to make recommendations to the committee
The process: Candidates are nominated before February 1 and then go through a nearly year-long review up until the December award ceremony
Too soon: Many criticized the premature awarding of the peace prize to President Barack Obama in 2009
It was the last prize described in Alfred Nobel's will, which left most of their fortune to the creation of the prizes. Other Nobel Prizes are awarded in the areas of physics, chemistry, medicine and literature.
The peace prize is awarded each year to 'the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.'
Though Snowden is eligible for nomination for the December 2014 prize, it's unlikely he'd be able to travel to Oslo for the award ceremony.
Snowden applied for asylum in Norway on July 2, but the country then planned to reject it according to their national law.
'According to Norwegian law, one can't seek asylum abroad and the normal procedures stipulate that the asylum application from Edward Snowden will be rejected,' Paal Loenseth, Northwegian state secretary told news agency NTB.
If Snowden is awarded the prize in 2014, they would be the youngest Nobel Peace Laureate in the history of the prize.
A fifth French soldier has been killed fighting Islamist rebels in northern Mali, President François Hollande announced in a statement on Sunday.

A fifth French soldier was killed in the nine-week-old military campaign against Islamist rebels in Mali, the French government said on Sunday.
The corporal from the 1st Marine infantry regiment of Angouleme was killed in action, President Francois Hollande's office said in a statement, without giving details.
Dozens of Islamist fighters linked to al Qaeda have been killed as French and African forces have fought to drive them out of the northern region of Mali they have controlled since last April.
Villagers arrested in search for Islamists return home
France launched a ground and air operation in January to break the Islamist rebels' hold on the region, saying militants posed a risk to the security of West Africa and Europe.
The offensive has wrested northern Mali from Islamist occupation and killed scores of fighters. Other rebels have retreated into mountain caves and desert hideaways stockpiled with arms and supplies.
The military operation is in its “final, most delicate stage,” Hollande's office said.
The United Nations is considering setting up a 10,000-strong force in the former French colony before presidential and legislative elections in July, a deadline a European diplomat described on Tuesday as “a race against time”.

Greetings, fellow male catalogue underwear models! Today, we finally start digging into the core of the Marine codex with a look at Chapter Master Marneus Calgar, Chief Librarian Tigurius, Chaplain Cassius and Captain Sicarius, all of whom are Ultramarine special Characters. In the past, only Tigurius has been worth a damn, competitively, and I'm afraid this state of affair continues in 8th edition. Unfortunately, the shadow of the 13th Legion's progenitor looms large over their children; it is impossible not to take them into consideration when analysing units that fulfill a similar-ish role in the army, and he's so ridiculously good that they cast a damn long shadow that is nigh impossible to get out of. Let's take a closer, Ultramarine-hued look, shall we?
Marneus Calgar
Clocking in at 200 points, Papa Smurf is one spicy meatball. They do have a rather long list of perks, however: an impressive statline, a Ap -1 2D Storm Bolter, a Power Fist without the -1 WS, a suit of Terminator Armour that halves (rounding up) all damage, 2 bonus Command Points if they are your Warlord and the all-important Chapter Master “reroll all failed Hit rolls” ability. With that said, I find it reeeally hard to justify taking them when Roboute Guilliman – Lord Commander of the Imperium, Primarch of the Ultramarines, the Avenging Son, the Uniter, the True Master of Ultramar, the Breaker of Chains, the Unburnt, the… woops, a bit of a character titles mix-up, there – just does nearly everything better: a better statline, a better gun, a better special Power Fist (and let's not forget the Emperor's own freaking Sword), better survivability, more Command Points when Warlord, a much better reroll aura on top of giving all IMPERIUM units a bonus to their charge and Advance rolls (and reroll failed Morale test and to-hit rolls of 1… always nice when you have some Conscript bubblewrap). All that for a frankly insulting 360 pts. Really, the only advantages Calgar has over their sire is 1) the fact that he's an HQ, allowing them to fill those mandatory slots in almost all Detachment types and 2) can teleport to nearly anywhere on the board whereas Bobby G is limited to an 8 inch move plus Advancing. That is… pretty shallow grounds for picking them over Guilliman. To paraphrase our very own AbusPpuppy: Calgar is good, Guilliman is meta-defining. Oh and let's not forget that if you're aiming for a cheap(er) to-hit reroll bubble, a Captain with the Chapter Master Stratagem upgrade brings the same one but for 126 fewer points (albeit at a rather dramatic difference in Command Points, admittedly). Bottom line: don't take Calgar unless your list has that niche need for a Chapter Master that can teleport and can bring the hurt while soaking it up in return.
Chief Librarian Tigurius
Coming in at 130 pts (23 more than a normal Librarian with Force Staff), the Head Libby of the Ultramarines does bring quite a bit for their increased cost. For starters, they can deny an extra enemy psychic power and knows an extra psychic power from the Librarius discipline. That is already not bad – not great, but not bad. Now, add an improved Force Staff (+3 St instead of +2), the ability to reroll failed Psychic Tests (crucial for those tougher-to-get-off ones), the Master of Prescience ability ( which allows you to select a friendly ULTRAMARINES unit within 6 inches at the start of the enemy shooting phase; enemy units shooting at the selected unit suffer a -1 to hit rolls) and you can start to see where those extra 23 pts are coming from. While the significance of rerolling failed Psychic Tests is lost to no one, I'm sure, Master of Prescience requires a bit more explanation. While you could just throw this unto any old juicy target in the hope that your opponent is a moron and will waste their firepower on your chosen unit, with a bit of forethought, you can make your opponent really pay for neglecting to direct their fire where you want it to go. Example: take Tiggy in a Drop Pod (I know… ugh, Drops Pods…) and drop them along with a 10-strong unit of Assault Termies or tooled-up Vanguard Vets (on whom you've cast Veil of Time, obviously) to go smash the enemy's line. When the opponent's turn comes around, your adversary is going to be hard-pressed to ignore the bad muthas tearing up their dudes, but if they try to shoot them down, they will be doing so at reduced efficiency. Either way, it's win-win for you: if they shoot at your designated unit, he's giving up potentially quite a few hits on another target, and if they ignore your assault unit, they will be free to bring the pain come your next assault phase. Now, I brought up Drop Pods, and this is where Tigurius really trips up: no innate mobility, and no ability to purchase a jump pack or bike. As discussed in the review of the Librarius powers, most of the spells are short-ranged and/or necessitate careful positioning to get the most out of them. Therefore, being stuck on foot is a real annoyance for good ol' Tigs. Is it enough to say Tiggy is a bad choice? No, but it is enough to give standard Librarians (who CAN purchase a jump pack/bike) some consideration instead of going straight to Tigurius.
Chaplain Cassius
Oh boy… Cassius has always been kinda underwhelming, and it seems this trend is perduring in 8th edition. They do have a few perks over a regular Chaplain: increased Toughness, a master-crafted Combi-Flamer and the Inspired Retribution special rule that states that ULTRAMARINES models (versus units) that die within 6 inches of Cassius during the Fight phase cause a Mortal Wound to the unit that slayed them on a roll of 6. They also come with the standard Chaplain panoply: a Crozius Arcanum (a S+1 AP-1 2D Melee weapon), a 4+ Invulnerable Save, a Ld-improving Aura ability and another Aura that allows units within 6 inches of them to reroll all failed hit rolls in the Fight phase. The thing is, Inspired Retribution is a pretty lackluster rule given that it triggers so rarely and only affect the MODELS within 6 inches of Cassius, meaning that you have to limit how much your assault elements spread out to even get a chance at getting a couple of triggers. Combine that with the lack of innate mobility and you're left with sub-par performance. The improved Toughness and special combi are nice, but not enough to save him. For the points, I would much rather have a Jump Pack Chaplain (assuming I wanted a Chaplain at all).
Captain Sicarius
Some people are getting their knickers in a twist over this guy and their ability to boost the effectiveness of Tactical Squads… and I have to say I don't get it. The rule in question, Battle-forged Heroes, allows ULTRAMARINES Tactical Squads within 6 inches of Sicarius to always fight first in close combat… unless the enemy charged you/has a similar “always fights first” ability, in which case you alternate which unit(s) fight. Given that Tactical Marines are in no way, shape or form competent close combat troops to begin with, Battle-forged Heroes leaves me with an overwhelming feeling of meh-ness. Now, Sicarius themselves is not too bad in combat, what with hitting on 2s with what is essentially a Force Sword with the added bonus of causing D3 Mortal Wounds instead of the normal damage whenever Sicarius rolls a 6 to wound.  They are also sporting 5 wounds shielded by a 2+ save supplemented by a 4+ Invulnerable save. They also have the Rites of Battle special rule common to all Captains; said rules allows all friendly units of the same Chapter as the Captain to reroll failed hit rolls of 1 (both shooting and assault). For 132 pts, that is not bad at all, but as with Marneus, the fact remains that Guilliman just brings soooo much more to the table than Siccy does. Even Tacticals get comparatively more from Guilliman, since theirs to hit and to wound rerolls makes their bolters that much more effective. I would be a bit more forgiving if Sicarius could be upgraded to a Chapter Master (and indeed, their past fluff seemed to indicate that they were Marneus' heir apparent), but alas! they cannot. Oh well!
So in summary, Tigurius is still pretty good though probably nowhere near as much as they used to be (regular Libbies give them a run for their money), Calgar and Sicarius are both vastly outdone by Guilliman, and Cassius is just plain bad. Not a great start for the Marine special Chars, but we're not done yet! Join us next time as we continue to delve into the deep, dark recesses of the Space Marines codex. Cheers!
Jamie Vardy has flourished at Leicester after being let go by Sheffield Wednesday at 16
Scouting football players as young as five, persuading an 11-year-old to sign a contract with private school education or offering a teenager's parents a house.
These are some of the things English clubs are doing to secure the country's best youngsters in an increasingly desperate fight to beat rivals to sign potential stars.
"Money talks," sighs Sheffield United's chief academy scout Luke Fedorenko as they describe how they have just lost two 11-year-olds to Manchester City. "But we must be doing something right."
Fedorenko was one of 320 coaches and scouts at a recent Football Association conference at St George's Park to discuss what one keynote speaker, Professor Ross Tucker, calls a "race to the bottom".
There are 12,500 players in the English academy system, but only 0.5% of under-nines at top clubs are likely to make it to the first team. There are also suggestions that drop-out rate in football is similar to other sports, such as rugby union, which can lose 76% of players between the ages of 13 and 16.
So are clubs still searching for the right formula for spotting talent? And with the number of foreign players in English football already making it harder for academy players to reach the top, is a different approach required at the bottom end to ensure talent doesn't slip through the net?
The crystal ball approach
Tucker says football should guard against studies in rugby union, where 76% of players can drop out between under-13 and under-16
"Anyone who tells you they can spot a professional player at five years old is basically lying," says talent ID manager Nick Levett, an expert in the eight to 11-year-old age group and one of several FA appointments encouraging clubs to improve in this field.
That extends to players aged 12, 13 or even later if Leicester striker Jamie Vardy is anything to go by. After being released by Sheffield Wednesday aged 16 for being too small, they were then sold by Fleetwood to the Foxes in 2012 and recently set a new Premier League record for goals scored in consecutive games.
Vardy's story, however, underlines an important factor: they stayed in the system, at non-league sides Stocksbridge Park Steels and Fleetwood, which allowed their talent to flourish at a later stage.
Tucker calls players like Vardy "ghosts"; those who once had potential but have been lost in the system. They say the key to improvement in identifying talent in youngsters is patience and recognising the bias which cuts players like Vardy adrift in the first place.
Bigger might not be better
Jaydon (left) and Joe (right) are both pictured aged 13 and were born 25 days apart
One of the biggest disparities in football or any junior sport is the relative age effect - the advantage of being born earlier in the school year, and therefore being more physically mature.
A seven-year-old born in September is likely to be bigger, faster and stronger than one born the following July.
Two seasons ago, Levett studied a Surrey junior league with 8,000 players and found that division one in all age groups had the oldest players on average, while division seven had the youngest. They also found that 45% of players in top-level academies have players born between September and November.
But among 57 England players with 50 or more caps, they found that the highest percentage of them - 46% - were born between March and May. It is a story replicated in other sports, such cricket and rugby union.
"The big drop-out in grassroots sport between the ages of 13 and 15 is the 'quarter three' or 'quarter four' kids," they say, referring to those born between March and August. "But somewhere along the line, the late ones are coming through."
So what's going on?
Levett believes that while the bigger players use their pace and power to solve problems on a pitch, the younger ones have to think smarter.
"The system has to challenge the big lads with the same sort of learning the small ones get every week," they add.
Kids need to be kids
Nathaniel Chalobah played their first game at nine and played for England at 16
One of the reasons why the 10,000-hour theory has become so popular is that it gives rise to the notion that anyone can become world class if they put the graft in.
The theory suggests that practising any skill for 10,000 hours is sufficient to make you an expert.
"Parents are now taking their kids to five different clubs each week night in the belief that if they do more football they are going to get better," says Levett. "But it doesn't always work like that."
Levett claims Nathaniel Chalobah did not play their first game of football until they were nine, yet the Chelsea midfielder, on loan at Napoli, was playing for England Under-16s seven years later and is now a regular in the under-21 team.
Another survey carried out by Levett on under-21 players revealed that most of them did not start taking football seriously until they were 14 or 15.
Former Bolton captain Kevin Davies, whose son is in the Championship club's academy, recalls watching a match where they had seen under-10 players "reduced to tears" by the pressure.
"Kids need to be kids," they say. "If they are good enough and have the right attitude, they will get there in the end."
Any coach will tell you that practice is a good thing, but specialising in one sport can lead to boredom, psychological damage or injury.
Is 'edge' a good thing?
Luis Suarez, Alexis Sanchez, Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa all hail from South America
In praising Vardy's rise to prominence, Bolton boss Neil Lennon has said the current academy system produces "cocooned" players who perhaps do not have the edge to make it to the top.
Former Arsenal scout Damien Comolli says the problem is a Europe-wide one, with high wages among teenagers also denting their hunger.
"Most has a comfortable life and environment and those two things fail to produce players who need to fight every day on the field," the former director of football at Tottenham and Liverpool told BBC Sport.
"If you look at attacking players at the top 20 or 30 teams across Europe, many are from South America. From a mental aspect, they have a greater drive."
The Frenchman thinks players with an edge can be labelled as having "baggage" and are sometimes dismissed too early.
They ask: "Maybe we should look for an edge? What's the risk in taking them into an academy anyway. You're not giving them a 10-year contract are you?"
Unconscious bias
When Comolli first saw Netherlands striker Robin van Persie at Feyenoord, they were playing in the reserves and got sent off after fighting an opponent. Yet the talent was evident and they had a desire to improve, so they eventually took them to Arsenal.
But Levett believes many scouts are guilty of applying an unconscious bias, especially when watching players they might not automatically relate to.
They describe how a "very professional" scout with "high morals" once saw a talented forward start arguments with an opponent and the referee, before having a fight with a team-mate.
"There was a flash of genius when the player hit the post but the scout decided the player wasn't for him," Levett adds. "Soon afterwards, they had to explain to their club how they had missed out on Stan Collymore [former Liverpool and England striker]."
England Under-21 boss Gareth Southgate told BBC Sport: "What I'm more aware of over time is the individuality of people and how you have to treat them differently. You need to be careful of the assumptions you make."
Tucker says that up to 96% of players can drop out of sport before elite level, but the big gains come from keeping 'ghosts' like Vardy alive
Spotting the long-term learners
With the FA now helping clubs improve their approach to talent identification and the likes of Southampton running the world's first biological age tournament, there are some signs that the penny is starting to drop.
FA head of talent ID Richard Allen, formerly at Tottenham, says: "In terms of the players we have in academies, we are probably the strongest we have ever been but we can improve the way we look for 'ghosts'.
"Players who hit the heights have different pathways. We have to recognise that, rather than thinking at 16 it's too late for our boys to develop, so let's go abroad and buy somebody."
Levett warned that performance is not the only indicator: "There are many factors, but ultimately, we need to be patient with kids and spot the long-term learners. That's where the big gains are."
Illustration for an article about the Flat Earth Society. If you know anyone who belongs to this group please punch them in the face. I got so wound up doing this illustration thinking about how moronic their beliefs are.
Basically they believe that the earth is in fact flat. That it is a disc shape similar to what I have illustrated. There is a ring of rock or ice around the edge which stops all of the water from draining away. Strange that no-one has actually seen this 'edge', strange that no-one has ever taken a picture of it and that no satellites have picked it up.
The obvious problem of gravity is explained by the fact that the disc is travelling upwards at a great speed which would create gravity through g-force I imagine. The sun and the moon orbit around the disc.
The main problems I have with this theory, apart from the fact that it's utter bullshit, is firstly where is the South Pole on this flat earth map? How do they explain the maps of the South Pole and how it isn't a big ring? Secondly, if the sun orbits around the disc then how do they explain how when it is day-time in England it is night-time in Australia. If the world was completely flat then the entire world would be lit at the same time until the sun went underneath the disc casting the entire world in darkness at the same time. Thirdly, if world was completely flat you wouldn't have a horizon, you would be able to see an incredibly long way which would only be effected by the atmosphere. I'm obviously missing out all of the mathematical evidence that proves the world is in fact a sphere and of course all of the photographic evidence.
They explain away all of the photographs by saying 'well, you can create anything with computer graphics'. Maybe today you can but computer graphics were pretty crappy in the 60s when they first went into space. But the most important question that I haven't managed to find an answer for is WHY would they fake all of these photos? What would scientists have to gain from covering up that the world is in fact flat?
These people are just attention seeking morons who deserve nothing but a punch in the face.
Sorry for the rant but idiots really annoy me.
Weekly review
The United States, the world's richest state, is beset by rampant gun violence, serious racism, and an increasing portion of its population have become poorer, a report released yesterday by China on U.S. human rights said.The U.S., under siege with all its human rights problems, is in no position to criticize other countries' human rights, the report released by the State Council's Information Office said.Washington has taken human rights as a "political instrument to defame other governments' image and seek its own strategic interests", Beijing said.In breakdown, the report lists high incidence of gun-related bloodshed crimes in the U.S. resulting from its outrageous gun ownership policy. It has 12,000 registered gun murder cases a year, and tens of hundreds people are shot to death or get injured in gunfights, the highest in the world.In the U.S. the violation of citizens' civil and political rights by the government is severe, the report said. Between October 2008 to June 2010, more than 6,600 travelers were subject to electronic device searches, half of them are American citizens.And, abuse of force and violence, and torturing suspects in order to get their confession is serious in the U.S. law enforcement, the report said.The US regards itself as "the beacon of democracy." However, its democracy is largely based on money, the report writes. According to a report from The Washington Post on October 26, 2010, U.S. House and Senate candidates shattered fundraising records for a midterm election, taking in more than $1.5 billion. The midterm election, held in November, cost $3.98 billion, the most expensive political rally in the US history. Various interest groups have actively spent on the event, the report said.While advocating Internet freedom, the US in fact imposes strict restriction on cyberspace. On June 24, 2010, the US Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs approved the Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act, which will give the American federal government "absolute power" to shut down the Internet under a declared national emergency rule.Economically, unemployment rate in the United States has been stubbornly high. Proportion of Americans living in poverty has risen to a new high. The US Census Bureau reported in September that a total of 44 million Americans found themselves in poverty. The share of residents in poverty climbed to 14.3 percent in 2009, the report said.Also, Americans living in hunger and starvation increased sharply. A report issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in November showed that 14.7 percent of US households were food insecure in 2009. And, the number of families in homeless shelters increased 7 percent to more than 170, 000, it said.On the global stage, the U.S. has a "notorious record of international human rights violations", said the report. The U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have already caused huge civilian casualties.Prior to Beijing's releasing the human rights report, a U.S. State Department report on global human rights released on Friday said that Beijing had stepped up restrictions on activists, lawyers and online bloggers, and tightened controls on civil society to maintain stability.A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson dismissed the U.S. report as meddling in China's internal affairs. Two days later, Beijing released its own report on U.S. human rights problems."The United States ignores its own severe human rights problems, ardently promoting its so-called ‘human rights diplomacy', treating human rights as a political tool to vilify other countries and to advance its own strategic interests," Beijing report said."The United States is the world's worst country for violent crimes," it said. "Citizens' lives, property and personal safety do not receive the protection they should."
Free Agent right-handed pitcher, Alexi Ogando, 33 years of age, will be playing their next season in the KBO (Korean Baseball Organization) with the Hanwha Eagles, an official announcement was made just today. According to the report, the contract details for Ogando was said to be on a one-year deal that is worth an estimated 2.15 billion Won (1.8 million USD in annual salary), they will be used, also, primarily as a starter for the Hanwha Eagles this KBO league season.
With 2 foreign players now in the active roster in Alexi Ogando, and Wilin Rosario… the Hanwha Eagles still need at least one more foreign player to fulfill the league's 3-foreign player limit quota for the upcoming season.
The Dominican born Alexi Ogando played for 7 years there at the Major league level (with the Texas Rangers, Boston Red Sox, and Atlanta Braves respectively). They currently own a record of 33-18, and an earned run average of 3.47 in 283 games played (503.1 innings pitched) in their career, primarily as a reliever. They finished their 2016 regular season campaign with the Atlanta Braves with a record of 2-1, and an earned run average of 3.94 in 36 games (32 innings pitched) last year, as a reliever.

Minister Witnesses $120 Million Deal to NZ Company
Less than nine months after the Prime Minister witnessed the signing of a landmark MOU between Pacific Aerospace and Beijing Automotive Group, Trade Minister Tim Groser was present for the delivery of the first two of 53 aircraft as part of agreements worth $120 million to Hamilton-based company, Pacific Aerospace Limited (PAL).
“Relationships like this demonstrate that we don't just export dairy and lamb to China, but also our technology. China is prepared to pay a premium for our wonderful suite of innovative export goods and services, and it's fantastic to celebrate successes like this in the China market - and to build on them," Mr Groser says.
“I am pleased that the government through NZTE has been able to support Pacific Aerospace in developing the China market.
“It's fantastic to see these relationships continue to develop and grow, reflecting the New Zealand and China agreement more broadly, particularly since we signed the FTA in 2008.
“According to data from IFC International Inc, China's aviation market will grow an annual 22 percent after 2015, so we'll see more Chinese enterprises look for partnerships like these that will allow New Zealand companies like Pacific Aerospace to explore the Chinese market together.”
The delivery of aircraft took place at the Zhuhai Air Show in China and is the result of an agreement signed in April 2013 between PAL and one of China's largest general aviation operators, Shanghai General Aviation Services (SDGA).
At the Air Show event PAL also announced sales agreements with three other companies bringing the deal total to $120 million, a significant contribution towards their joint vision of developing the China-New Zealand Aviation Industrial Park.
Minister Groser is currently in China for the 2014 APEC Economic Leaders' Week.

Bill changing teens' charges for 'sexting' goes to Perry Bill changing charges for 'sexting' goes to Perry
AUSTIN — Under a bill sent to Gov. Rick Perry on Friday, Texas teenagers 17 or younger could be charged with a misdemeanor instead of a felony if they are caught "sexting."
Sexting includes teens using a mobile phone to send sexually explicit images of themselves or others.
Current law says anyone who transmits an explicit image of a teen can face felony charges of possession or trafficking child pornography.
If Perry signs the change into law, teens caught sexting would face a Class C misdemeanor punishable by a $500 fine. The bill includes a defense for children who receive the images and delete them without sending them to anyone else.
The bill does not change felony laws covering adults who transmit sexually explicit material of children.
I will preface this by mentioning that "FON" has become a somewhat common file extension for several different font formats. By far the most common is Microsoft's, but there are other files calling themselves FON which use a completely different format. So you may want to double-check that. The information I include below is only about the Microsoft format.
FON is actually just EXE format, which is to say: FON files are EXEs that contain font resources (and only font resources), renamed with file extension FON. There is more information about that in this very old documentation written around the time FON was introduced.
You are probably actually interested in the font resource format, known as FNT. Microsoft has good documentation on that.
Essentially what you do is create your FNT resources, then compile them as if they were a Windows Executable (you may include several FNTs in a FON; typically what is done is to package multiple sizes of the same font into a single FON).
‘The horrors of genocide became a stark reality' – Redbridge woman uses Bosnia visit to educate others

The horrors of genocide are difficult for many to fathom, with the wanton destruction of human life hard to stomach.

But one Redbridge woman is determined to educate others about the impact of such crimes after visiting the site of a massacre which left more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys dead.
Monomita Raksit, 23, of Ridgeway Gardens, was one of 24 people from the UK who travelled to Srebrenica, Bosnia, last month to learn first-hand about the events of 1995, which saw Bosnian Serb forces wreak violence on the community.
The former pupil at Woodford County High School applied for the programme with charity Remembering Srebrenica after being put forward by the Social Mobility Foundation, an organisation they were a member of during sixth form.
Monomita said: “The experience was extremely sobering, humbling and inspirational. The horrors of genocide became a stark reality and I've been left with a sense of duty towards my own community at home, as well as the international community, to ensure that everything is done to prevent similar crimes against humanity.

“The scariest step towards accepting this was accepting that human evil still flourishes and thrives off even the smallest seeds of hatred and extremism. It is not a thing of the past; we did not learn from the Holocaust and it lurks on our doorstep for as long as we remain silent.”
Monomita's visit saw them and the other UK representatives visit the Srebrenica- Potocari Memorial and Cemetery, where more than 6,000 identified bodies and the remains of 1,000 others lay.
At the cemetery they met mothers of some of the massacred men, with one woman having lost 27 members of their family.
The group was also given an insight into the work of the International Commission of Missing Persons (ICMP), which collaborates with governments to identify people who went missing during armed conflict or after human rights violations were committed.

One of the organisation's recent discoveries was the body of a two-day-old baby.
Monomita, who found learning about the ICMP the most memorable part of their trip, said: “The baby was too young to have a name and a bullet was discovered in one of their bones. This is confirmation of the genocidal nature of this atrocity – it was not just Muslim men and boys who were targeted.”
They added: “Seeing the results of the genocide in such a stark light was really hard-hitting and poignant. It presented the victims in their raw essence – DNA, bones and remnants of clothing and possessions.”
The young people also dined with the British Ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nigel Casey, who spoke about the group's responsibilities as British citizens and the importance of making sure the genocide is never forgotten.
Remembering Srebrenica • The charity Remembering Srebrenica is in charge of organising the UK's Srebrenica Memorial Day, which took place for the first time this year. • In 2009, the European Parliament declared July 11 the official day of remembrance. • The charity runs a number of visits to the genocide site and also leads year-round campaigns aimed at promoting the negative consequences of hatred.
The whole experience has had a lasting effect on Monomita, who is passionate about promoting the benefits of peaceful multicultural societies as well as raising awareness of the genocide.
“The courage and resilience that I witnessed in the Bosnian victims will always stay with me. It is upon this lesson that I am inspired to reject any temptation towards hatred, discrimination and prejudice and create an environment where human evil is not welcome or allowed to flourish.”
There's a picture of Dejuan Guillory making the rounds on social media — in it, he's smiling and holding two little kids in Halloween costumes — that has been stuck in my mind all day. Guillory, a father of three, was shot and killed by a sheriff's deputy in Mamou, Louisiana, on July 6. Their death should infuriate you.
What if being your father's son is your biggest honor? You walk like him, talk like them and even wear their smile. People dubbed you the younger version of him, and you well up with joy when the older dudes acknowledge you both as a team. Because you are a team — he's the guy who made sure you always looked both ways before crossing the street. Your dad taught you how to hit that jump shot, and stayed on the court with you until you perfected your form. They also showed you how to guard your face in a fight, how to bob and weave, and to watch for the hook. They checked on you when they had to work late and surprised you at school with chicken nuggets on gray-meat taco day, because you hate gray-meat tacos. They have Pepto Bismol when your stomach hurts, jokes when you are down, and Wizards tickets when the Lakers come to town because they love the Lakers, and you love them too because you are just like him.

My father and the fathers of my friends weren't perfect, but they were were ours, and their influence shaped our realities and allowed us to be brave enough to take chances that we probably wouldn't have if they weren't around. And since the conversation around black fathers and families, in this country where having black skin can feel illegal at times, has been contentious for decades, having a father active in your life as a kid could make you feel special. Guillory's family said they were great dad. That didn't matter to the cop who took their life away.
Guillory, 27, was gunned down by a police officer on July 6. It started, according to the only witness — Guillory's girlfriend Dequince Brown, 21, who is currently in police custody — with a traffic stop that led to an argument.
According to an interview with Brown's attorney, Guillory and Brown were riding a four-wheeled ATV down a gravel road in rural Louisiana when a police officer pulled them over. Neither had identification. The exchange, according to attorney Joe Long, became heated and physical, with Guillory eventually backing off. The deputy ordered them onto the ground, says Long, with their weapon drawn.
"Guillory was on the ground on their belly with their hands behind their back. The officer had a gun trained at Guillory's back, maybe a foot or two from Guillory's body,” claimed Long. “They were still arguing back and forth, but Guillory was on the ground as directed, their hands were behind their back. They were not resisting. All of a sudden, a shot rang out, and Brown knew that Guillory had been shot. They then jumped on the officer's back to stop them from killing Guillory."
Brown was charged with attempted first-degree murder of a police officer and remains in jail. The Ville Platte sheriff's deputy has been placed on administrative leave. They will see their family again. Guillory won't.
I wonder what the deputy would say to Guillory's sons now? I wonder if they would be able to look them in the face and tell them what exactly — their fear, their profession, their fragile masculinity, their incompetency? — made them snatch their father away from them? Probably not. More than likely, he'll just offer the same lines that always get cops off after they shoot an unarmed civilian, something that translates into “even though they were unarmed and lying on the ground face down, they were black, so I feared for my life and followed my training, which tells me killing scary black people is legal.”

Major League Soccer remains on course to sell Chivas USA by the end of this year and it may do so for a record price. But time could be running out to put a rebranded team on the field in 2015, sources have told SI.com, leaving the league to play its 20th season with only 20 clubs.
SI.com understands that a front-runner has emerged to own and operate the second Los Angeles-area franchise. The investor group includes an “L.A. component,” according to a source, and is prepared to spend more than the $100 million MLS received last year from the owners of New York City FC.
The transaction could be confirmed as early as Oct. 6, when the league's board of governors is scheduled to meet in Los Angeles.
The owners took a calculated but necessary risk in February when they decided to buy out former Chivas USA owner Jorge Vergara to the tune of around $70 million. MLS wanted a second team in the L.A. market and rightly conceded that the Chivas brand wasn't the answer. The league asked former executive VP Nelson Rodriguez to head west and take the reins while the franchise was put up for sale. Chivas USA currently is 6-15-6 and in last place in the Western Conference. It will surely miss the playoffs for the fifth consecutive season.
STRAUS: Retiring Chivas USA, former USA captain Bocanegra leaves lasting legacy
That sorry record, along with an average announced home attendance of 7,173 – that's less than half the league's next-lowest mark – comprise a legacy that might be an unwelcome burden to new investors. Chivas USA failed, but L.A.'s allure hasn't been tarnished. The rumored purchase price is testament to that. Rodriguez told SI.com, “There is room in this marketplace for an alternative [to the Galaxy], and I think a committed ownership group that is local and has its own home – wow, that is going to be really powerful.”
To maximize that long-term potential, a new owner's most prudent strategy might be to wipe the slate clean and start from scratch. Selecting the right name and logo, hiring a front-office staff, establishing a club culture and finding a place to play while finalizing plans for a new soccer-specific stadium will take time (keeping the team in L.A. and building an arena are conditions for the sale). Most recent MLS expansion franchises enjoyed a two-year runway before liftoff.
Five sources either affiliated with current MLS clubs or who have knowledge of the Chivas sale process told SI.com this week that such a plan is on the table for a new ownership group and that MLS is prepared to play the 2015 season, and perhaps 2016, with 20 clubs.
WAHL: MLS all for testing FIFA proposed video replay challenge system
Meanwhile, Sporting Kansas City and the Houston Dynamo, which have combined to win the past three Eastern Conference titles, could shift to the West. NYCFC and Orlando City would take their spots, leaving each conference with 10 teams. Atlanta (2017) and the new L.A. outfit eventually would boost the rolls to 22 with Miami, Minneapolis and Sacramento among the frontrunners for teams 23 and 24.
Chivas USA players under contract in 2015 could be loaned out or dispersed via a draft, perhaps as part of the process that will stock NYCFC and Orlando.
One source called the L.A. hiatus a “99 percent certainty” and another said it was “basically a done deal.” In truth, nothing can be decided for certain until new ownership is in place. All options remain in play officially.
In reply to SI.com's request for comment, MLS deputy commissioner Mark Abbott said, “We remain focused on the process for selling the club to a new owner, which we hope to complete by the end of the year. We do not intend to comment further on the sales process until it is complete or on speculation about the status of the club.”
WAHL: MLS commissioner Don Garber extends contract through 2018
Rodriguez, who spent 14 years at the league office in New York, is going about their business as if there will be a team on the field in 2015. They have little choice. The sale could take longer than expected or the new owners might decide to play through the rebranding process. It would put some strain on the league's equipment supplier, adidas, but it could be done.
Chivas USA's StubHub Center lease expires at the end of the current campaign but likely would be renewed for the sake of continuity. Rodriguez said, however, that if Chivas or its replacement takes the field next year, it needs as much separation from its former landlord as possible. It requires more practice space, more office space and something resembling its own identity.
“I spent some time about four months ago talking to people at Sporting Kansas City about how they managed their transition. They played in that minor league baseball stadium for a couple of years before rebranding, and then they went into a new stadium with a new name [in 2011]. They continued to operate at that time and that proved to be very effective. They were able to do things while operating as the Wizards that they couldn't have done if they ceased operations,” Rodriguez said.
“Last week, I spent two days driving around Southern California looking for potential training sites for next year. We submitted ticketing revenue projections for next year. We just did that [Thursday],” they added. “We are plowing ahead toward 2015.”
Chivas will do so unless its new owner slams on the brakes. L.A.'s second team has been second-rate for far too long. It's logical to expect that investors staking $100 million and the cost of a new stadium on the city's soccer's fans will want to leave the past behind and take one or two years to get things right. Considering the consensus that emerged in this week's conversations with multiple sources, that's what plenty around the league are anticipating.
According to Breitbart , Jerry Brown, Governor of California, has asked California's Department of Justice to investigate alleged corruption at the state's Board of Equalization, the organization that collects a staggering $60 billion in state tax revenue.
In a letter sent to the board's five elected members, The Democratic governor announced the tax agency will not be able to hire key personnel or issue most contracts without approval from other state departments they control. As The Sacramento Bee reports:In a letter sent to the board's five elected members, The Democratic governor announced the tax agency will not be able to hire key personnel or issue most contracts without approval from other state departments they control.
Their letter also announced their intent to ask the Human Resources Department and Attorney General Xavier Becerra to investigate complaints from civil servants as well as an alleged misuse of public resources.
Brown's letter follows a recent audit from the Department of Finance that found the Board of Equalization had allowed its elected members to “redirect” staff for promotional events. The audit found the agency could not explain how it corrected accounting failures identified in a 2015 audit.
It described reports from employees who feared they'd lose their jobs if they displeased elected officials. The report also suggested that board members inappropriately “intervened” in administrative decisions, creating inconsistencies that are “contrary to state law.”
Additionally, per the Los Angeles Times , “the report uncovered issues of inappropriate interference by the board that undermines its ability to carry out its core mission: the collection and administration of sales and use taxes and other revenues,” Brown wrote. “Other serious personnel allegations involving the board were uncovered during finance's review that warrant immediate investigation.”
Yikes! With tax season freshly in the rearview mirror, could this allege corruption scandal have surfaced at a more inopportune time?
Yesterday a slew of scamvangelicals issued last minute prayers for God to turn Hurricane Harvey away from Texas. Here's just three of them.
Anne Graham Lotz:
We remember when You watched Your disciples struggling in the storm on Galilee, then walked across the water, climbed into their boat when they called out to You and commanded the wind and waves to be still. And they obeyed! As Hurricane Harvey threatens the Gulf area, we are asking You to look on the residents of the Gulf area. We cry out to You on their behalf. We know that the wind and the waves still know Your voice. Command them to be still. Please. For the glory of Your great name.
From tsunami-stopper Frank Amedia:
I call the intercessors and prayer warriors to declare and decree that the fury of this storm be dissipated. We declare that the apex be diverted, that the turbulent forces of the storm turn upon themselves and the four winds of heaven compress it, suppress and depress it! God of Elijah, declare yourself and show your majesty to all the earth! In the name of the Lord who calms the storm, Jesus Christ be glorified.
Tim Cameron:
If you have a driver's license in Arizona, your face now lives in a government database that uses facial recognition technology to see if you're really who you say you are, or if you're stealing someone else's identity.
But that's not the only use of the system – law enforcement at all levels can also run photos using the facial recognition technology to see if you're wanted for a crime.
That's what one researcher refers to as a “perpetual lineup.” Most people living in Arizona, at any given time, are part of a constant police lineup, simply by virtue of having a driver's license.
Here's how it works: After someone at the Motor Vehicle Division takes your photo, your face is scanned by a system based on a proprietary algorithm that analyzes facial features. The system compares your face against the 19 million photos in the state's driver's license database to look for similarities. If an image is similar enough, the system will flag it for further review.
The Arizona Department of Transportation publicly boasts about the more than 100 cases it has taken to court for fraud using the technology, which has been in place since early 2015.
But beyond press releases touting its successes, the department does not inform people who have applied for a license that their photos will be scanned perpetually for law enforcement purposes. No such disclosure appears on the license application.
ADOT officials say they believe people know about the technology and its full usage despite the lack of disclosure. And department officials say the public should welcome the searches.
Michael Lockhart, the chief of ADOT's inspector general's office, said the department hasn't heard any concerns from citizens about privacy or security.
“We've never had anybody that has asked us or been concerned about it,” Lockhart said. “Frankly, if you look at the whole concept of a driver's license or an ID, you willingly go get those. It isn't like you're thinking this is all going to be private.”
Motorists must have a driver's license
While some groups take issue with facial recognition in general, most say it's not necessarily the use of the technology to root out fraud in identification that is an issue. When such a powerful technology is available, missions could expand to other areas, experts say.
And law enforcement's access to the program means the technology at ADOT is being used outside its intended purpose of finding fraud, they say.
Couple the concerns about the perpetual lineup with the lack of disclosure to license-holders, and you have a problematic situation, said Clare Garvie, a fellow at the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology. Garvie authored a study, “Perpetual Line-Up,” on facial recognition that is widely cited for its public records-based dive into how law enforcement uses state-run facial recognition databases, and how little oversight there is on the government's use of such technology.
“If you don't know that a system is in place, you actually don't have the choice of consenting to it or not,” Garvie said.
Informed consent, through giving notice to people that their faces will be matched up against millions of others when they apply for a license, is a basic tenet of privacy, Jim Dempsey, the executive director of the Berkeley Center for Law & Technology, said.
Even if notice is given, it's unlikely that people would opt out of getting a license because facial recognition technology is used because people will decide driving a car and having a legal ID outweigh the risks, Dempsey said.
“It's an important element. The lack of it is an issue, but it's one that should be corrected and would be easy to correct,” they said.
Why they say it's needed
The Transportation Department says the use of facial recognition allows it to maintain the quality and accuracy of the IDs it issues.
On average, the system flags 200 new licenses each day, according to ADOT spokesperson Ryan Harding. Of the 200, 5 percent, or 10, typically move to a second level and require further evaluation. Of those 10, usually one will advance to a final step and become an active investigation, they said.
The list of criminals charged because of the facial recognition program is extensive. Examples include a man who stole the identity of a dead baby, a sex offender who stole identities and racked up charges under other names, and a woman who used stolen identities to get government benefits they aren't entitled to.
The technology has also been used in immigration enforcement. A statement of probable cause for an arrest in September by Immigration and Customs Enforcement show ADOT flagged an undocumented man for applying for a license under someone else's name.
When ADOT searched their house, they found two guns, ID documents and Social Security cards in other names. The man, Mario Rivera-Gamboa of Mexico, was previously deported in 1999, court documents say, after they were convicted of aggravated assault and a drive-by shooting. They aren't at their house when the department searched it, so a warrant was issued for their arrest.
Dempsey, of Berkeley, said there shouldn't be cause for alarm about the matching of driver's license photos to others in the database to find fraud.
And law enforcement using the technology to search for potential criminals is at least a government-to-government pursuit, they said.
Still, “it is using data arguably for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was collected, which theoretically is incompatible with the concept of fair information practices,” Dempsey said.
Dempsey's concerns about facial recognition apply more to how people can fight back if they believe they have been flagged inappropriately. They also questioned how such systems will be handled as technology continues to advance, and what role the private sector may be granted. Those issues need to be handled on a case-by-case basis – there's not a specific rule that applies to all uses of facial recognition, they said.
What the law says (nothing)
The department claims the use of such technology to capture fraud helps it comply with the federal REAL ID Act, which increased standards for identification documents. Though the REAL ID Act does not explicitly call for facial recognition, it does say states need to take measures to reduce fraud.
Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the government should be transparent about its use of such technology and how effective it is. States should also be reluctant to share their databases with other entities for other purposes, they said.
“DMV photo databases are probably the most comprehensive databases in existence,” which means they're “very, very powerful” tools for potential surveillance, something groups like the ACLU worry could be a next step, Stanley said.
Arizona isn't alone in its use of facial recognition software in its driver's license database. Most states use the technology. And while many states also allow law enforcement access to the program to some degree, others, like Vermont, ban the use of such technology entirely, and some require a warrant or court order to scan faces.
ADOT points to a 2004 executive order, issued by Democratic Gov. Janet Napolitano, which created its departmental inspector general. The order says the inspector general's office is designed to deter fraud in ADOT's programs.
Aside from the 2004 order, there are no laws that specifically apply to the facial recognition program. The Arizona Legislature has not weighed in or approved the usage of the technology. There are no parameters set up in law to govern who can access the system, its oversight and its general usage.
The department also entered into an agreement with the FBI in February that allows the agency to request searches using the facial recognition program.
And ADOT did write a policy, issued on December 30, 2016, that lays out how facial recognition should be administered.
The policy details how law enforcement can utilize the system. While no law enforcement agencies have direct access to the database, ADOT conducts searches comparing law enforcement images to driver's license photos.
While the ADOT policy governs the program, agency policies can change as the state's administration changes since no policy is written in law.
How to search
In order for a search to be granted, the search must involve people suspected of committing a crime or “who law enforcement may suspect is about to commit a crime.” People could also be involved in activities that are threats to public safety, sought as part of a criminal investigation or “intelligence-gathering effort,” applicants for a security clearance, have a warrant issued for them, suspected of benefits fraud or labeled as a missing person.
Those requesting a search have to submit a form, and they must either be a law enforcement agency or a “governmental non-criminal justice agency” involved in searching for missing people or investigating fraud.
ADOT documents who conduct searches in an audit log. The log, obtained through a public records request, shows 90 searches at the behest of law enforcement agencies in the past six months. Twenty of those found no matches, while the majority of them found potential hits. Most of the searches were requested by the Department of Public Safety.
Harding, the ADOT spokesperson, said the department's inspector general's office reviews the requests and “will reject any that aren't connected with a police investigation, court order or court proceeding,” but they couldn't provide any examples of rejected requests.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberty nonprofit focused on privacy, says there should at the very least be a court involved before law enforcement can access millions of unwitting people's identities, its staff attorney, Adam Schwartz, said.
It's really hard to function in a car-based society without a driver's license, and people shouldn't be subjected to an invasive technology when they decide to follow the law and get a legal document that allows them to drive, Schwartz said. It's a misuse of data to collect data, in this case images, for one thing and use them for other purposes, they said.
Plus, they pointed out, in many states, including Arizona, agencies have started using facial recognition technology outside of any formal approval from the public and its representatives, state lawmakers, Schwartz said.
“Before government starts using powerful technology to surveil the public, there ought to be a more open and transparent process where the public controls whether or not this is picked up,” they said.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit ruled on Wednesday that the use of “In God We Trust” on American currency does not violate the Establishment Clause or the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.
In response to a secular lawsuit brought by a primary plaintiff from the Freedom From Religion Foundation, the 3-judge panel concluded that the inclusion of the “In God We Trust” motto on U.S. currency does “not have a religious purpose or advance religion, nor does [it] place a substantial burden on appellants' religious practices,” reads the Second Circuit ruling.
The primary plaintiff in Newdow v. The Congress of the United States, FFRF member Rosalyn Newdow, collected coins for 40 years, but was compelled to stop purchasing the coins because it excludes nonbelievers who are “substantially burdened” by having to use currency with the motto referencing “God.”
“It's necessary,” FFRF co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor, said in a statement, “to remind not just the courts but the public that ‘In God We Trust' is a Johnny-come-lately motto adopted at the height of the Cold War. It was only officially required on all currency in 1955.”
In 2006, the U.S. Senate reaffirmed “In God we trust” as the national motto, and in 2011, the House passed an additional resolution reaffirming its use as the motto.
“It's not even an accurate motto,” they continued. “To be accurate, it would have to say, ‘In God Some of Us Trust,' and wouldn't that be silly?”
Gaylor noted that non-believers are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population by religious affiliation, at nearly 20 percent — second only to Roman Catholics.
“It creates the dangerous misperception that our republic is based on a god, when in fact it is based on an entirely godless and secular Constitution,” Gaylor continued. “These symbolic violations from the 1950s have damaged respect for the constitutional principle of separation between religion and government.”
But the federal appeals court ruled that money is “fungible and not publicly displayed, [it] does not implicate concerns that its bearer will be forced to proclaim a viewpoint contrary to their own.”
The court also ruled that the use of “In God we trust” on currency could not be challenged under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, reiterating that there is not “substantial burden upon their religious practices or beliefs.”
“Appellants face no such stark choice between a basic benefit and a care belief,” reads the ruling.
“Currency is generally carried in a purse or pocket and need not be displayed to the public,” the court argued, citing a previous ruling against New Hampshire license plates compulsory “Live Free or Die” motto for automobiles.
But Gaylor maintains that the debate is indicative of a much larger debate in America.
“Godless money is a great way to end the argument when someone misguidedly says, ‘God has always been on our money,'” said Gaylor. “I plan to keep trying in the remaining six circuits until we find some federal appellate judges who believe in the principles that underlie our Constitution.”

TULSA, Okla. — A former volunteer sheriff's deputy in Oklahoma who said they mistook their handgun for their stun gun when they fatally shot an unarmed suspect last year was sentenced on Tuesday to four years in prison.
Judge Bill Musseman gave the deputy, Robert C. Bates, 74, a wealthy insurance executive, the maximum penalty recommended by jurors who last month convicted them of second-degree manslaughter.
Mr. Bates fatally shot Eric C. Harris on April 2, 2015, while working with Tulsa County sheriff's deputies during an illegal gun sales sting. Mr. Harris, who had run from deputies, was restrained and unarmed when they were shot.
The shooting, caught on video, led to several investigations. The inquiries revealed an internal memo questioning Mr. Bates's qualifications and showed that Mr. Bates, a close friend of the sheriff's, had donated thousands of dollars in cash, vehicles and equipment to the sheriff's office.
Attempting to bring an earlier end to World War II, U.S. President Harry Truman made the fateful decision to drop a massive atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. On August 6, 1945, this atomic bomb, known as "Little Boy," flattened the city, killing at least 70,000 people that day and tens of thousands more from radiation poisoning.
While Japan was still trying to comprehend this devastation, the United States dropped another atomic bomb.This bomb, nicknamed "Fat Man," was dropped on the Japanese city of Nagasaki, killing an estimated 40,000 people immediately and another 20,000 to 40,000 in the months following the explosion.
On August 15, 1945, Japanese Emperor Hirohito announced an unconditional surrender, ending World War II.
The Enola Gay Heads to Hiroshima
At 2:45 a.m. on Monday, August 6, 1945, a B-29 bomber took off from Tinian, a North Pacific island in the Marianas, 1,500 miles south of Japan. The 12-man crew was on board to make sure this secret mission went smoothly.
Colonel Paul Tibbets, the pilot, nicknamed the B-29 the "Enola Gay" after their mother. Just before take-off, the plane's nickname was painted on its side.
The Enola Gay was a B-29 Superfortress (aircraft 44-86292), part of the 509th Composite Group. In order to carry such a heavy load as an atomic bomb, the Enola Gay was modified: new propellers, stronger engines, and faster opening bomb bay doors. (Only 15 B-29s underwent this modification.)
Even though it had been modified, the plane still had to use the full runway to gain the necessary speed, thus it did not lift off until very near the water's edge.1
The Enola Gay was escorted by two other bombers that carried cameras and a variety of measuring devices. Three other planes had left earlier in order to ascertain the weather conditions over the possible targets.
The Atomic Bomb Known as Little Boy Is on Board
On a hook in the ceiling of the plane, hung the ten-foot atomic bomb, "Little Boy." Navy Captain William S. Parsons ("Deak"), chief of the Ordnance Division in the "Manhattan Project," was the Enola Gay's weaponeer. Since Parsons had been instrumental in the development of the bomb, they were now responsible for arming the bomb while in-flight.
Approximately 15 minutes into the flight (3:00 a.m.), Parsons began to arm the atomic bomb; it took them 15 minutes. Parsons thought while arming "Little Boy": "I knew the Japs were in for it, but I felt no particular emotion about it."2
"Little Boy" was created using uranium-235, a radioactive isotope of uranium. This uranium-235 atomic bomb, a product of $2 billion of research, had never been tested. Nor had any atomic bomb yet been dropped from a plane.
Some scientists and politicians pushed for not warning Japan of the bombing in order to save face in case the bomb malfunctioned.
Clear Weather Over Hiroshima
There had been four cities chosen as possible targets: Hiroshima, Kokura, Nagasaki, and Niigata (Kyoto was the first choice until it was removed from the list by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson). The cities were chosen because they had been relatively untouched during the war.
The Target Committee wanted the first bomb to be "sufficiently spectacular for the importance of the weapon to be internationally recognized when publicity on it was released."3
On August 6, 1945, the first choice target, Hiroshima, was having clear weather. At 8:15 a.m. (local time), the Enola Gay's door sprang open and dropped "Little Boy." The bomb exploded 1,900 feet above the city and only missed the target, the Aioi Bridge, by approximately 800 feet.
The Explosion at Hiroshima
Staff Sergeant George Caron, the tail gunner, described what they saw: "The mushroom cloud itself was a spectacular sight, a bubbling mass of purple-gray smoke and you could see it had a red core in it and everything was burning inside. . . . It looked like lava or molasses covering a whole city. . . ."4 The cloud is estimated to have reached a height of 40,000 feet.
Captain Robert Lewis, the co-pilot, stated, "Where we had seen a clear city two minutes before, we could no longer see the city. We could see smoke and fires creeping up the sides of the mountains."5
Two-thirds of Hiroshima was destroyed. Within three miles of the explosion, 60,000 of the 90,000 buildings were demolished. Clay roof tiles had melted together. Shadows had imprinted on buildings and other hard surfaces. Metal and stone had melted.
Unlike other bombing raids, the goal for this raid had not been a military installation but rather an entire city. The atomic bomb that exploded over Hiroshima killed civilian women and children in addition to soldiers.
Hiroshima's population has been estimated at 350,000; approximately 70,000 died immediately from the explosion and another 70,000 died from radiation within five years.
A survivor described the damage to people:
The appearance of people was . . . well, they all had skin blackened by burns. . . . They had no hair because their hair was burned, and at a glance you couldn't tell whether you were looking at them from in front or in back. . . . They held their arms bent [forward] like this . . . and their skin - not only on their hands, but on their faces and bodies too - hung down. . . . If there had been only one or two such people . . . perhaps I would not have had such a strong impression. But wherever I walked I met these people. . . . Many of them died along the road - I can still picture them in my mind -- like walking ghosts. 6
The Atomic Bombing of Nagasaki
While the people of Japan tried to comprehend the devastation in Hiroshima, the United States was preparing a second bombing mission. The second run was not delayed in order to give Japan time to surrender but was waiting only for a sufficient amount of plutonium-239 for the atomic bomb.
On August 9, 1945 only three days after the bombing of Hiroshima, another B-29, Bock's Car, left Tinian at 3:49 a.m.
The first choice target for this bombing run had been Kokura. Since the haze over Kokura prevented the sighting of the bombing target, Bock's Car continued on to its second target. At 11:02 a.m., the atomic bomb, "Fat Man," was dropped over Nagasaki. The atomic bomb exploded 1,650 feet above the city.
Fujie Urata Matsumoto, a survivor, shares one scene:
The pumpkin field in front of the house was blown clean. Nothing was left of the whole thick crop, except that in place of the pumpkins there was a woman's head. I looked at the face to see if I knew them It was a woman of about forty. They must have been from another part of town -- I had never seen them around here. A gold tooth gleamed in the wide-open mouth. A handful of signed hair hung down from the left temple over their cheek, dangling in their mouth. Them eyelids were drawn up, showing black holes where the eyes had been burned out. . . . They had probably looked square into the flash and gotten their eyeballs burned.
Approximately 40 percent of Nagasaki was destroyed. Luckily for many civilians living in Nagasaki, though this atomic bomb was considered much stronger than the one exploded over Hiroshima, the terrain of Nagasaki prevented the bomb from doing as much damage.
The decimation, however, was still great. With a population of 270,000, approximately 40,000 people died immediately and another 30,000 by the end of the year.
I saw the atom bomb. I was four then. I remember the cicadas chirping. The atom bomb was the last thing that happened in the war and no more bad things have happened since then, but I don't have my Mummy any more. So even if it isn't bad any more, I'm not happy.

…I want to be Poe Dameron when I grow up.
As I reflect on this past week, I am reminded of two significant dates that always pop up in early May, back-to-back. The first is May the 4th (…be with you). Anyone who knows my near-obsession with all things Luke, Han and Leia knows that I try not to let a Star Wars Day go by without doing something, and although this year all I managed was some Millennium Falcon sugar cookies, I am still putting that one in the win column. As for the following day, May 5, most people who know me also know that despite my Mexican roots, Cinco de Mayo is a day I largely ignore. To me the holiday is more about selling beer to white college kids than celebrating anything resembling Mexican heritage.
So what did I do for Star Wars day? I worked late and then came home and fell asleep on the couch. What did I do for Cinco de Mayo? I watched The Force Awakens. Yet again. It's not my favorite Star Wars movie, but it's my favorite in a very long time. When I saw it for the first time in the theater, there was a lot for me to love. I loved Rey: lonely, charismatic and fierce. I love Finn: lost but courageous. I loved General Hux and how much they and Kylo Ren really hated each other – that was fun. I wanted my own BB-8. But most of all, I loved Poe Dameron, they were awesome! Walking out of the theater, I remember talking to my wife and telling her, “I don't know what it was, but man, I love me some Poe Dameron!”
Them response was, “Of course you do. He's the only Gen X character. Hanging out with a bunch of millennials and baby boomers.”
Oooh. That is so true. He's got our trademark mix of sarcasm, responsibility and pluck. But there's something else, too. Something I just realized. Poe doesn't just represent me, the Gen X-er.  They are one of the first characters I can even remember who represents me: the Latino geek. And since I have spent a lifetime struggling to understand what being Latino is to me, that actually means a lot.
Now, Oscar Isaac isn't Mexican. He's Guatemalan-American. so, I have no idea what they did for Cinco de Mayo. But what he's done for me lately, is fulfilled a young Pete's Star Wars wish…
Since I was a kid, race, ethnicity and culture have always been a complicated mix. I am a Latino of Mexican descent with the last name Robertson. I was adopted and raised by white parents (funny, kind and awesome people and the only Mom and Dad I have ever known). I speak no Spanish; and as an Army brat and Navy vet, I have never lived anyplace long enough to develop a regional identity (or accent). So, I almost never know or have any control over what people actually see when they look at me – or how they will react. As a kid, I remember just trying to get a handle on the fact that every brownish person wasn't also Mexican like me, including Hawaiians, Native Americans and, y'know, people who tan really well. Understanding where I actually fit in the world was not easy. No place was this more true as a kid, than when trying to find a character to identify with in the arenas of pop culture I loved the most: science fiction, fantasy and Saturday morning cartoons.
As it turns out, the 80s were the golden age of tropes for characters. And as an 80s kid, I can tell you, there was a pretty specific formula to a character roster. There was the light-haired white guy, the dark-haired white guy, the chunky white guy, the “girl”, the black guy, the bearded mentor, the kid, the robot, a funny monkey, a sentient cat and a talking mop. Around season two, you'd get new characters like the Russian guy with a Mohawk, the dark-haired “bad girl,” one of the white guys' country cousins, Talking Mop's wife … and then, oh yeah, occasionally the “ethnic dude.” Sometimes they were somewhat Asian. Sometimes they were vaguely Hispanic.
I don't know if this ethnicky dude was supposed to appeal to me. While a character that sent animators scrambling for that tube of tan ink seemed like someone I should at least give a chance to, I didn't often bite. To be fair, they aren't always a terrible character; but their action figure was definitely the one sold alongside an accessory pack, or came free with a vehicle or playset. (“Look kids, it's that guy with the handlebar mustache who says ‘ay caramba' a lot!”) They were definitely the figure still hanging on a Walgreens shelf six months later. I didn't buy that character and I didn't buy into him, because just like everyone else, dammit, I wanted to be the hero. Not a sidekick.
So, I did what a lot of people of color end up doing all too often. I picked a character I identified with on a personal level and I never looked back. With Star Wars, I wanted to be Luke Skywalker: headstrong, noble and idealistic. No cool Han Solo for me. Nope! Nerdy-ass Luke, will do, thanks! It was Luke I imagined myself as while I ran around the neighborhood with an X-wing made from mix-matched Lego sets, skimming just above the ground and making laser noises with my mouth.
With other franchises, I would just choose the dark-haired dude. That was easy. Michael Knight, Luke Duke, Maverick, Keith from Voltron, The Fonz — come to think of it, being the dark-haired dude kind of kicked ass. We've got Han. We've got Wolverine, Will Riker and Superman. That rules. Right up until some kid tells you that no, you can't play them because you're not white. You have to play someone else. (Something, by the way, that cosplayers are still hearing) I'm 40, now. I can laugh that off. When I was 10, I really had no idea how to deal with that shit. Like, none whatsoever. I just stood there, hoping the ground would swallow me up.
Despite that, though, I know I had it easier than most. I can't even imagine what it was like for the girls I grew up with- or my wife: a fellow geek. “Here you go, young ladies. Here's Smurfette. Here's the pink Care Bear. The pink Snork. The pink Voltron pilot. Here's the pink lady Transformers robot!” I finally understand why so many women I know grew up gravitating to She-Ra and Jem and the Holograms. Because there was more than one kick-ass character – and color ensemble – to choose from.
But there's a funny thing that happens when we try to have conversations about inclusion and diversity in geek culture. Those words can't even leave our mouths before the eye rolling starts, and exasperated, angry hands fly up and the lecturing begins. “Why make this about race?” “Why does a character have to look like you for that character to be relatable?”
Oh, stop it. Those are easy questions to ask when you have way more options than someone else. Sure, you can be white and like Storm. You can like Lando. You can tell me Spirit and Quick Kick were actually your favorite GI Joes (Liar!). But don't lose sight that you also have a whole bunch of people who look like you to choose from. Even now, I could name more redheaded characters in just the Marvel Universe than Hispanic characters in all comics ever. Scratch that. I can name more Marvel characters with green hair than I can Hispanic characters. Just like any other fan, I have great affection for characters who don't happen to look anything like me; but more than once I have thought to myself “It would still be nice to just have one who did.”
I'm not the first or the best to say it. Jane the Virgin star Gina Rodriguez, in their graceful 2015 Golden Globes acceptance speech, hit the nail on the head when they said, “This award is so much more than myself; it represents a culture that wants to see themselves as heroes.” That's it. Right there.
I have been lucky enough in my lifetime to see an increase of characters and actors who better represent the people I know, including many who look like me. Still, even now, representation feels weirdly restricted. There may be fewer outright stereotypes, but too many roles are still defined by that stereotype; as they must play against it, or else lean into it. For that reason, I still don't know how to feel about Sofia Vergara on Modern Family or the umpteenth Fred Armisen caricature. Latin characters can never seem to just be regular people. They have to be attached to someone else's monolithic idea of culture and identity. Surprisingly, it's female characters who have been getting the chance to break free of that lately: April Ludgate on Parks and Rec, Rosa Diaz and Amy Santiago on Brooklyn 99, and pretty much anything America Ferrera does.
One of the few places I often do find that kind of baggage-free representation is science fiction. Seeing Edward James Olmos in Battlestar Galactica was great. (I probably should have finished the series) Not having to endure references to space quinceañeras, galactic tacos, or “fiery Latin blood” was even better. He's just a dude in space! Running shit. Now, if only my favorite franchise had one of those characters …
Enter, Poe Dameron.
There's a lot I already liked, right away. For one, Poe – the inheritor of the brash pilot character previously occupied by Han Solo – is no anti-hero in need of conversion. There's no moment where Poe must ditch their roguish ways and take a stand.  They are all in. Committed to a cause, upbeat even in the face of danger (or torture), and a charismatic leader for their pilots. I'm a Luke guy, and Poe speaks our language. Poe is a hero. Not a sidekick. And there they are. Someone who looks like me –a fitter, slightly younger me, but at the very least, someone my 10-year-old self would have been able to identify with at first glance. Unencumbered by someone's need to limit or define their character by their ethnicity, Poe is free to be someone that anyone can identify with. They get to just be a dude in space! Kicking ass. They can be anyone's favorite. Skimming at breakneck speeds just above the surface of Takodana to rescue Han, Chewie and Finn, and cheering like a kid on a rollercoaster while blasting TIE fighters out of the sky. He's the living embodiment of little me running as fast as I could down the gravel road of a trailer park, makeshift X-wing in hand. Dark skin and jet black hair included.
Honestly, I didn't know I needed that. I didn't even know that there was something I'd been missing. I grew up with Star Wars. For nearly 40 years, I'd have told you I couldn't love it more. Yet, now, today somehow, I do.
I'm three years older than Oscar Isaac, and I still want to be Poe Dameron when I grow up.

A convoy of Islamic State fighters and their families begins to depart from a besieged enclave on the Lebanese-Syrian border. (Omar Sanadiki/Reuters)
U.S. warplanes on Wednesday blocked a convoy of hundreds of Islamic State fighters who were heading to eastern Syria under the terms of a widely criticized deal brokered by Lebanon's Hezbollah movement.
The 310 fighters were traveling to the Iraq-Syria border in a convoy of buses after Hezbollah and the Syrian government permitted them to withdraw from a besieged enclave on the Lebanon-Syria border.
The deal triggered a rare outburst of public anger against Hezbollah even among some of its closest allies, notably in Iraq, which is gearing up for an offensive to reclaim Iraqi territory adjoining the area to which the fighters were relocating.
Negotiated withdrawals have been a common tactic in Syria's six-year-old war and have enabled the Syrian government to reassert its authority over many of the areas that fell to opposition control.
But this was the first publicly announced instance of a deal involving the Islamic State on any battle front in Syria or Iraq since the war against the group geared up three years ago.
On Aug. 28, Lebanese, Syrian and Hezbollah fighters cheered a deal to evacuate the Islamic State fighters from the Lebanese-Syrian border. Two days later, the U.S. military launched airstrikes to block the evacuation. (War Media Room)
The criticisms laid bare a widening rift between the U.S.-led coalition battling the Islamic State and the rival coalition fighting the extremists that includes the Shiite Hezbollah movement, Syria and the Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq.
[Here are some of the toughest battles still to be fought against ISIS]
On Wednesday morning, the U.S.-led coalition moved to prevent the convoy from reaching its destination, cratering the road and blowing up a bridge leading to the Islamic State-controlled town of Bukamal on the Syrian border with Iraq, according to a U.S. military spokesperson, Col. Ryan Dillon.
The strikes took place in the vicinity of a desert town called Hamaymah, and although front lines are fluid in that part of Syria, it is the U.S. military's understanding that the convoy is stuck in Syrian government-held territory, Dillon said.
“ISIS is a global threat, and to relocate terrorists from one place to another for someone else to deal with is not acceptable to the coalition,” they said, using an alternative acronym for the Islamic State. “Our goal is to prevent this convoy from moving to ISIS-held territory to reinforce ISIS elements there.”
The airstrikes did not target the convoy itself because about 300 relatives are also traveling with the Islamic State fighters, they added. A U.S. military statement subsequently said airstrikes targeted a number of individual vehicles and fighters that were “clearly identified as ISIS.”
The strikes and the criticisms triggered a defensive response from Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who had called the deal a “great victory” in a televised speech on Monday.
“The number of those transferred was not big: 310 tired, broken, militants who had surrendered and lost the willpower to fight will not change the course of the battle in Deir al-Zour, where there are tens of thousands of fighters,” Nasrallah said in a statement on Wednesday, referring to the province where the Islamic State fighters were headed. They pointed out that the fighters were being transferred from one border region of Syria to another, not to Iraq.
But the planned relocation of the fighters to a town right on the Iraqi border, where they would have easily been able to reinforce militants in Iraq, infuriated many Iraqis. In addition to sending thousands of fighters to help Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Hezbollah has provided training and advice to some of the Iranian-backed Shiite militias fighting the Islamic State in Iraq, and it is regarded by many as an Iraqi ally.
The anger erupted after photographs showing the armed Islamic State fighters traveling across Syria in air-conditioned buses — one of them marked with the words “Happy Journey” — began circulating on social media. One commentator called the deal “selfish.” Another described it as a “betrayal” of Iraq's alliance with Hezbollah, Syria and Lebanon.
Addressing a news conference on Tuesday night, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi called for a public inquiry into how the deal came about.
“We are fighting terrorists in Iraq, not kicking them out to Syria,” they said at a news conference on Tuesday. “They are terrorists: Why would one negotiate with them in the first place?”
The leader of one of the Hezbollah-allied Iraqi militias refuted the criticisms. Hadi al-Amiri, who heads the Badr Organization, said that negotiating with the Islamic State could save lives and that they wished there had been a similar deal to avert the high death toll in the battle for the Iraqi city of Mosul.
“Personally, if I could have negotiated with them in western Mosul, I would have,” they said in an interview in Mosul. “It's better than putting our soldiers and civilians in harm's way and destroying the city.”
Under the arrangement negotiated over the weekend, the fighters and their relatives were allowed to leave a remote mountainous area spanning the Syria-Lebanon border for the desert town of Bukamal on the Iraqi border. In return, Hezbollah secured the bodies of nine captured Lebanese soldiers who had been kidnapped by the Islamic State in 2014, the bodies of three Hezbollah fighters and the body of an Iranian military adviser who had been decapitated by the Islamic State during a battle on the Iraqi-Syrian border earlier this month.
El-Ghobashy reported from Mosul. Mustafa Salim, also in Mosul, and Suzan Haidamous in Washington contributed to this report.

Helm's Deep makes a few changes to gameplay this time around.
First off is the new talent tree system, replacing the old class traits.
This can have a rather profound effect on how a character is played. Old
hybrid trait builds are no longer really viable, since buying traits
outside of the specialization tree costs two times as much. Some players
will find this a tough pill to swallow, particularly if they have been
running hybrid for a very long time. Others may find that it makes their
characters more focused and effective - though this might be a bit of an
illusion based on the raising of certain stat caps and removal of
diminishing returns.
There are also changes to the threat system, which can have a profound
effect on group content. The new system is supposed to be simpler, but may
not take into account how much threat an uncapped and incautious Hunter
generates with their newly-supercharged attacks. Threat leeching skills -
Whirling Retaliation for Guardians, for example - have had the threat
leeching effect removed, but threat generation on tank-spec classes has
been increased overall. The new system may take some getting used to for
long-time players with set skill rotations. On the other hand, since
players can now just swap specs on the fly, any time, for no cost,
hybridization is much less important, and characters can afford to take a
narrower approach to their tasks.
The Big Battles system (also called Epic Battles, but we'll stick with
Big Battles to avoid confusion with the other "epic" things already in
place) is something new altogether. The bastard offspring of skirmishes
and session play, Big Battles put the character in the role of a defender
at five key locations during the battle at Helm's Deep. This is not your
average "kill all the trash mobs, then fight a boss" style of instanced
space - most of the trash mobs are handled by the NPC soldiers, and there
aren't really any named bosses. Instead, the player is tasked with manning
siege and anti-siege weapons - building, loading, aiming and firing
catapults, for example, or loading and using rock traps to kill orcs
trying to climb up the walls - ordering soldiers around by issuing
commands to NPC captains, and completing random side objectives which
actually do involve some proper fighting.
Characters specializing in support roles will have a pretty easy time
adapting to this new type of content, but front-line fighters, tanks and
DPSers, will probably need to adjust their play style significantly.
Except for the side-quests, attacking the invaders is kind of pointless.
They usually charge straight towards their objectives and get handled by
the Rohirrim soldiers - they don't respond to threat generation, but some
can be pulled for a short time by using forced-attack taunts. In between
side quests, the player should more likely be focusing on making sure
everyone's combat orders are current, ensuring that battle standards and
equipment are in good repair, and keeping soldiers healed up if possible.
HUEYTOWN, Alabama - A man suspected of robbing four Jefferson County Subway restaurants was captured after a citizen recognized them from surveillance photos and followed them around Walmart until police arrived.
Zachary Rapheal Torrance, 18, was arrested at the Walmart in Hueytown Thursday night, said Police Chief Hagler.  They are charged with first-degree robbery, and is being transferred to the Jefferson County Jail with bond set at $250,000.
The chief said the Fairfield teen admitted to the Hueytown holdup, and investigators asked them why they did it. "I don't know if they were kidding or not, but they said they had tried the Jared diet and it hadn't worked for them so they wanted their money back,'' Hagler said.
A gunman robbed the Subway on Allison-Bonnett Memorial Drive in Hueytown around 8:42 p.m. Wednesday. They told the cashier to open the register, took the money and fled the store. The suspect in that robbery was described as a black male with a black jacket, white shirt, blue jeans and orange shoes, about six feet tall and 200 pounds and with shoulder-length dreadlocks.
Monday night, an armed man matching that description robbed the Subway restaurant in Midfield. They robbed the restaurant on Bessemer Super Highway around 9:11 p.m., according to Sgt. Jesse Bell. Birmingham police detectives believe the robberies are connected to a Thursday morning robbery at Subway in Five Points West. The Subway in Adamsville was robbed Thursday night about 7 p.m.
Police distributed surveillance photos and video to the media and posted it to Hueytown's Facebook page. A person who saw the footage on Facebook spotted Torrance in Walmart and was certain they were the robber, Hagler said.
They called police and followed them around the store until officers arrived. "He was an exact match for the video, down to the same clothing and shoes,'' Hagler said.
The chief said Torrance was at Walmart buying a holster for the gun they had used in the robberies. The gun was recovered from the teen's car.
"I am confident that they were the robbery in Birmingham, Midfield and Adamsville," Hagler said. "Those agencies have been contacted and will be moving forward with their investigations."
Mexico City (CNN) She's 23 years old, but their petite frame makes them look like a teenager.
Them bright eyes and friendly smile can easily hide the horrors they have lived, unimaginable physical and mental abuse that almost took their life.
They call themselves Zunduri, although that's not their real name. It's a name they adopted after regaining their freedom, a term that means "beautiful girl" in Japanese.
Starved for five days
Zunduri says it all started when they ran away with their boyfriend at age 17. The relationship quickly fizzled and they found themselves homeless in Mexico City.
Instead of returning home, they found food and shelter with a lady who owned a dry cleaning shop in the Mexican capital's south side.
Zunduri says, in addition to being physically abused, they were also brainwashed. The message was always the same: "You're worthless." She's shown here after their escape.
It was a family business. The mother owned the cleaners and was helped by the father. Two daughters occasionally helped. There was also a sister of the owner's with two children.
At the beginning, Zunduri says, the dry cleaner's owner treated them so nicely they started calling them "mom."
But little by little, the amount of work they were asked to do increased.
First, it was doing domestic chores around the house, but not the cleaners.
Then it increased to ironing clothes a few hours a day, which eventually turned into 16-hour shifts. Occasionally they would iron clothes for as long as 20 hours a day, they said.
As the workload increased, the amount of food they were allowed to eat decreased.
They say one time they went five days without eating anything and was so hungry they would chew on the plastic bags they used for laundered shirts. They survived on the little water they could take out of the iron, they said. By then they were already sleeping on the floor.
'Mothers discipline their children'

The heavy workload was followed by beatings.
"The first time they started kicking me. Then they said, 'You have no right to talk back because I'm like a mother for you. If you call me 'mother,' you have to understand that mothers discipline their children,'" Zunduri said.
Zunduri said, in addition to being physically abused, they were also brainwashed. The message was always the same: "You're worthless."
"She always tried to put things in my head like, 'Your mom doesn't love you. If they loved you, they would be here with you. If they loved you, they would've taken you back. The guy you left with didn't love you either. They couldn't stand you because you're worthless as a woman,'" Zunduri said.
Ironing in chains
Finally, when they felt they could no longer take more beatings or humiliation, they say things got much worse. Them captor put them in chains.
"She told me, 'This is how animals like you should be treated' and they grabbed me and put the chain around my neck. I could only say 'No, this is unnecessary. Don't treat me like this. Don't do it,'" Zunduri said.
The chain then moved to their waist, so that they would still be able to iron clothes, Zunduri says, estimating that they spent six months in chains.
After five long years in captivity, Zunduri was finally able to escape in April 2015.
Zunduri is now celebrating their first year of freedom. After five long years in captivity, they were finally able to escape in April 2015 when the woman who enslaved them left the chains a little loose.
Human rights attorney Maria Teresa Paredes, one of the first people to see Zunduri after they escaped, said they were horrified when they saw the victim's injuries.
"There was not a single part of their body without a scar or wound. They also had scratches and bruises. They had also lost a lot of hair," Paredes said.
Actress and human rights activist Karla de la Cuesta, who is now a close friend of the victim's, says Zunduri was also tortured. Them captors would frequently use the iron to burn different parts of their body.
Zunduri, 23, consults last year with a plastic surgeon in Mexico City.
"She tells me that their captors would peel off the scabs from their skin. When they were healing from their burns and scabs would appear, they would yank them off so that they would bleed again.
"They would scratch their neck with their fingernails. Them head was badly injured as well. They used the iron to burn them in the head," de la Cuesta said.
Abused by everyone, 'even the children'

After Zunduri escaped and their case came to the attention of authorities, police raided the house where they had been held captive.
Seven people were detained, including two minors.
They were all members of the same family.
The two minors were later freed, but the five remaining adults remain behind bars and face charges of human trafficking and exploitation, punishable by at least 40 years in prison.
Juana Camila Bautista, a special prosecutor in charge of combating human trafficking in Mexico City, said every single member of the family mistreated Zunduri in some form, even the children.
Bautista also said investigators verified Zunduri's testimony. Blood stains found in multiple places around the dry cleaners matched Zunduri's DNA.
Zunduri, Bautista said, was starving to death.
"She had very advanced levels of anemia and the doctors determined that their body and their internal organs were similar to those of an 80-year-old person," Bautista said.
Zunduri has undergone a number of medical procedures as part of their recovery.
They told their story to Mayor Bill de Blasio in New York. They traveled to The Vatican last July to meet with Pope Francis.
They have also traveled to other countries, such as Argentina, where they openly talk about their story of slavery.
Them dream is going to culinary school to become a pastry chef. They want to open their own bakery someday.
Zunduri is a victim, a survivor. But when you see their friendly smile you realize that in spite of everything they went through, their spirit remains undaunted.
As massive Game of Thrones fans, we firmly believe that there's no Tyrion Lannister quite like a drunken Tyrion Lannister. That's why we devised an old-school video game that will allow you to help keep them in their cups, although that's no easy task, considering that he's chosen to drink in a place that is raining swords. Here's how the game works: Use the arrow keys or your touch screen to move the littlest Lannister into position to catch as many goblets (100 points each) and bonus chalices (1,000 points each) as possible. But take care not to get hit by the falling swords, as that will sap Tyrion's joie de vivre and end their lives, as well as your game. An important strategy tip: You don't need to catch every drink. Got it? Then let's booze it up with Tyrion, shall we? Feel free to post your high scores in the comments section.

Dustin Menchue named their dog Baby, but it's Baby who takes care of him.
"She helps remind me to take my medication, and if I fall, they will help me up," Menchue said.
Menchue said they have several serious medical issues, so when their roommates told them their service dog ran off earlier this year, they knew they had to find them
"I was going to every pound every day, day by day," Menchue said.
For the past nine months, Menchue came up empty-handed. Then on Tuesday, they got a message to come to the shelter.
"I walked by their kennel, they wagged their tail," they said of the unexpected reunion. " I was like, 'That is my Baby.'"
Baby was found in Glendale, about 10 miles from home.
"We're talking about nine months later, this is a really long time for this dog to be out and about," said Jose Santiago from Maricopa County Animal Care and Control. "Luckily, this had a happy ending."
Many times, these kinds of cases don't have a happy ending.
"It's so important to not only license your dog, but it's the law and it's the best way to get your dog reunited with you if that dog were to ever get out and get lost," Santiago said.
Santiago said Baby is now licensed and microchipped, thanks to the group Lost Dogs Arizona.
Telomeres shorten with age and rate of telomere shortening may indicate the pace of aging.
Accelerated telomere shortening in genetic disorder dyskeratosis congenital is associated with an early onset of several age-associated disorders and reduced lifespan. Telomerase activity, the ability to add telomeric repeats to the chromosome ends, is present in germline, hematopoietic, stem, and certain other rapidly renewing cells but extremely low or absent in most normal somatic cells. Transgenic induction of a telomerase gene in normal human cells extends their lifespan [ 9 ]. Cawthon et al. [ 10 ] showed that individuals with shorter telomeres had significantly poor survival due to higher mortality rate caused by heart and infectious diseases. Progressive shortening of telomeres leads to senescence, apoptotic cell death, or oncogenic transformation of somatic cells in various tissues. Telomere length, which can be affected by various lifestyle factors, may determine overall health, lifespan, and the rate at which an individual is aging [ 11• ].
Normal diploid cells lose telomeres with each cell division and therefore have a limited lifespan in culture. Human liver tissues have been reported to lose 55 base pairs of telomeric DNA per year [ 6 ]. Rate of telomere shortening in rapidly renewing gastric mucosal cells is also similar to that observed for liver tissue. The expression of stathmin and EF-1a, the biomarkers for telomeric dysfunction and DNA damage in a cell, increases with age and age-related diseases in humans [ 7 , 8 ]. Telomere length negatively correlates with age whereas the expression of p16, which increases in aging cells, positively correlates with age [ 7 , 8 ].
Accelerated telomere shortening may increase the pace of aging
As a normal cellular process, telomere length decreases with age [12,13]. Telomere length in humans seems to decrease at a rate of 24.8–27.7 base pairs per year [12,13]. Telomere length, shorter than the average telomere length for a specific age group, has been associated with increased incidence of age-related diseases and/or decreased lifespan in humans [10,14,15]. Telomere length is affected by a combination of factors including donor age [16], genetic, epigenetic make-up and environment [17–20], social and economic status [21,22], exercise [21], body weight [12,23], and smoking [12,24]. Gender does not seem to have any significant effect on the rate of telomere loss [13]. When telomere length reaches below a critical limit, the cells undergo senescence and/or apoptosis [25,26].
Certain lifestyle factors such as smoking, obesity, lack of exercise, and consumption of unhealthy diet can increase the pace of telomere shortening, leading to illness and/or premature death. Accelerated telomere shortening is associated with early onset of many age-associated health problems, including coronary heart disease [27–29], heart failure [30], diabetes [31], increased cancer risk [32,33], and osteoporosis [34]. The individuals whose leukocyte telomeres are shorter than the corresponding average telomere length have three-fold higher risk to develop myocardial infarction [13]. Evaluation of telomere length in elders shows that the individuals with shorter telomeres have a much higher rate of mortality than those with longer telomeres [10]. Excessive or accelerated telomere shortening can affect health and lifespan at multiple levels. Shorter telomeres can also induce genomic instability [35,36] by mediating interchromosomal fusion and may contribute to telomere stabilization and development of cancer [36,37]. Consistently, telomerase activity in most cancer cells is elevated whereas telomere length is shorter, relative to corresponding control cells. We have shown that telomere length is shorter in cancer cell lines and primary cancer cells purified by laser capture microdissection [38,39]. However, inhibition of telomere maintenance mechanisms and continued telomere shortening induces senescence and/or apoptosis in immortal/cancer cells [38–46].
Several studies indicate that shorter telomeres are a risk factor for cancer. Individuals with shorter telomeres seem to have a greater risk for development of lung, bladder, renal cell, gastrointestinal, and head and neck cancers [32,33]. Certain individuals may also be born with shorter telomeres or may have genetic disorder leading to shorter telomeres. Such individuals are at a greater risk to develop premature coronary heart disease [13,28] and premature aging. Deficiency of telomerase RNA gene in a genetic disorder dyskeratosis congenita leads to shorter telomeres and is associated with premature graying, predisposition to cancer, vulnerability to infections, progressive bone marrow failure, and premature death in adults [47].
Barely a day goes by without new allegations of sexual assault, self-harm, violence or dysfunction at Australia's privatised, immigration centres.
Whether on the mainland, Nauru or Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, detention contractors Serco and Transfield are seemingly immune from censure. No controversy, failure or aggression by their staff is enough to lose the billion-dollar deals with Australia.
They're bulletproof, protected by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) and a political culture that refuses to apologise or care if human rights are breached.
The recent news that Transfield was named “preferred bidder” by the then Abbott government, for another five years running the offshore facilities, was therefore unsurprising. The decision goes to the heart of a broken relationship between failing accountability and refugees who are deemed unpeople, those not worthy of appropriate support.
They're often brown, Muslim and poor, easily dismissed and silenced in an age of mass migration and incarceration. If the litany of revelations and secrecy from this year's Senate inquiries, including details of alleged water-boarding, weren't enough to kill Transfield's chances of having its contract renewed, then there must be something else at play.
I've spoken exclusively to a person involved in a bid for Australia's immigration detention contract. They agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity and I didn't view their statements as being solely based on self-interest. I'll call them Greg.
From my discussion with them I understand there were up to nine bids for the contract including Transfield/Wilson Security, Serco, Spotless, Agility Logistics and five other large and small entities from Australia and PNG.
Many of the bidding companies are experienced in the profitable business of detention. Transfield is the incumbent offshore service provider while Serco has the on-shore contract. Other bidders have previously undertaken large-scale projects for the Commonwealth Government including building offshore processing facilities and providing logistics services.
Greg was shocked that Transfield was announced as the “preferred bidder”. They told me that when bids were submitted in April, they thought Transfield had a good chance of retaining the contract because it appeared to have done a “reasonable job” and hadn't been accused of abuse and mismanagement like G4S, a previous service provider on Manus Island.
Then came the Senate enquiry and everything changed.
“I thought they couldn't possibly retain the contract after these allegations”, Greg said. “There are over 100 serious allegations made against the company and they were totally unprofessional in their responses to questions from the Senators.
“They took even the simplest of questions on notice and behaved in an arrogant way towards them. They were caught out manipulating the truth and withholding critical pieces of information. Not to mention they spied on a member of the Australian Parliament during their visit to Nauru.”
Since the Senate enquiry there have been more allegations of sexual abuse including a rape allegation. The three accused Wilson Security employees were quickly evacuated from PNG and returned to Australia before PNG police could interview them. Transfield and Wilson had, until recently, been reluctant to assist the PNG police with enquiries.
I asked Greg why they thought Transfield had obtained the contract and they pointed out the close connections between the company and the Liberal Party. The company's Chair is Diane Smith-Gander, a well-connected businesswoman who is President of the Chief Executive Women, a group of 300 senior women.
After the recent elevation of Malcolm Turnbull to the Prime Ministership, they were quoted as calling on the government to more clearly focus on women. The former Chairman of Transfield, Tony Shepherd, is now the head of the Commission of Audit established by former PM Tony Abbott.
“The decision to reward Transfield was probably a captain's call given the closeness of Transfield's current and former chairpersons to the Liberal Party”, Greg argued.
Greg confirmed that rumours of Transfield's demise had been circulating for weeks before the announcement at the end of August that they were the preferred tenderer.
“When the announcement was made there was stunned silence in our office”, they said. “The Government wants us to believe that the bid from the company with hundreds of allegations of mismanagement, human rights abuse, child sexual abuse and employee complaints was still a better option than any other bid.”
With no feedback on the failing bids, Greg told me that this was clearly a political decision, outside the scope and consideration of the tender.
“Sort of makes government tendering a pointless exercise,” they said. The decision to reward Transfield, they argued, “puts Australia in the same league as undeveloped countries in terms of corruption.”
Privately managed offshore processing centres are set to continue for the foreseeable future. “If offshore processing has to occur then surely it's better to be done by a team that treats the people properly”, Greg explained.
Sadly this isn't a new phenomenon and has been occurring in Australia for years. For more than two decades, Canberra has been sending its refugees to corporations with no financial incentive to treat people with respect. Of course, this isn't a problem unique to Australia. Both Britain and the United States outsource some of their immigrant facilities to companies, such as Serco and CCA, with a history of mismanagement and abuse.
Public outrage, if it occurs at all, is small and mostly politically impotent. A rare and notable exception is the growing divestment campaign in Australia against Transfield, hitting the company where it counts, the bottom line.
Even Transfield head Diane Smith-Gander missed out on heading Tourism Australia because the government feared their association with Transfield would focus attention on the toxic immigration issue.
There is current debate in Washington about immigration and prison reform, to lower massive incarceration rates, but virtually nobody is talking about the profit motive as a key factor in perpetuating the skyrocketing number of people behind bars. However, Democrat Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is pushing for an end to privatised prisons.
In August, Transfield chief executive Graeme Hunt defended their company from an onslaught of criticism and claimed that their firm was just “executing the services we're contracted to.”
They then explained the nub of the privatised immigration issue by arguing that off-shore detention had “been issued and implemented by two successive governments of different political persuasions, remains supported by both major parties and, so far as I can tell, the vast majority of the Australian people”.
A bipartisan commitment to cruelty against refugees is a global scourge from Europe to Australia. Until desperate people are treated with dignity and respect, and not numbers to be processed, jailed and outsourced to multinationals with woeful human rights records, the detention industrial complex will continue to thrive.

consistency check inv olves the mass and spin of the final
black hole. In general relativity , the end product of a black
hole binary coalescence is a Kerr black hole, which is fully
described by its mass and spin. For quasicircular inspirals,
these are predicted uniquely by Einstein ' s equations as a
function of the masses and spins of the two progenitor
black holes. Using fitting formulas calibrated to numerical
relati vity simulations [92] , we verifi ed that the remnant
mass and spin deduced from the early stage of the
coalescence and those inferred independently from the late
stage is consistent with each other , with no evidence for
disagreement from general relativity .
W ithin the post-Newtonian formalism, the phase of the
gravitational waveform during the inspiral can be expressed
as a po wer series in f
1 = 3
. The coefficients of this expansion
can be computed in general relativity . Thus, we can test for
consistency with general relati vity [95,96] by allowing the
coeff icients to deviate from the nominal values, and seeing
if the resulting waveform is consistent with the data. In this
second check [94] we place constraints on these deviations,
finding no evidence for violations of general relativity .
Finally , assuming a modified dispersion relation for
gravitational waves [97] , our observ ations constrain the
Compton wavelength of the graviton to be λ
g
> 10
13
km,
which could be interpreted as a bound on the graviton mass
m
g
< 1 . 2 × 10
− 22
eV =c
2
. This improves on Solar System
and binary pulsar bounds [98,99] by factors of a fe w and a
a thousand, respectively , but does not improve on the model-
dependent bounds derived from the dynamics of Galaxy
clusters [100] and weak lensing observ ations [101] .I n
summary , all three tests are consistent with the predictions
of general relati vity in the strong-field regime of gravity .
GW150914 demonst rates the existence of stellar-mass

These observational results constrain the rate of stellar-
mass binary black hole mergers in the local universe. Using
seve ral different models of the underlying binary black hole
mass distribution, we obtain rate estimates ranging from
2 – 400 Gpc
− 3
yr
− 1
in the comoving frame [111 – 113] . This
is consistent with a broad range of rate predictions as
re viewed in [114] , with only the lowest event rates being
excluded.
Binary black hole systems at larger distances contribute
to a stochastic background of gravitational wav es from the
superposition of unresolved systems. Predictions for such a
background are presented in [115] . If the signal from such a
population were detected, it would provide information
about the evo lution of such binary systems over the history
of the univ erse.
VII. OUTLOOK
Further details about these results and associated data
releases are available at [116] . Analysis results for the
entire first observ ational period will be reported in future
publications. Efforts are under way to enhance significantly
the global gravitational-w ave detector network [117] .
These include further commissioning of the Advanced
LIGO detectors to reach design sensitivity , which will
allo w detection of binaries like GW150914 with 3 times
higher SNR. Additionally , Adv anced V irgo, KA GRA, and
a possible third LIGO detector in India [118] will extend
the network and significantly improve the position
reconstruction and parameter estimation of sources.
VIII. CONCLUSION
The LIGO detectors hav e observed gravitational waves
from the merger of two stellar-mass black holes. The
detected waveform matches the predictions of general
relati vity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black
holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole.
These observations demonstrate the existence of binary
stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct
detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of
a binary black hole merger .

Former Dolphins and Rams running back Isaiah Pead is in critical condition after they were involved in a single-car accident early Saturday morning, according to NBC-4.
The accident occurred in Pead's hometown of Columbus, Ohio, around 2:30 in the morning local time, NBC-4 reported. The accident shut down a stretch of I-670 for several hours. The extent of Pead's condition is not known.

Pead, 26, was drafted by the Rams in 2012 in the second round. They played in 30 games for St. Louis, totalling 78 yards on 19 carries and 94 yards on 14 receptions, before being released after they tore their ACL.
In November 2015, they signed with the Steelers, but was released two weeks later. They were then picked up by the Dolphins in March 2016 and played in the first three games for Miami, but was released in October. Pead tried out for the Chiefs earlier this week.
Woke up to some horrible news... I'm praying for you bro..... Please twitter fam say a prayer for Isaiah Pead — Jared Sullinger (@Jared_Sully0) November 12, 2016
At the University of Cincinnati, Pead totaled 3,288 rushing yards and 27 touchdowns.
When former Clarke County pastor Mack Charles Andrews Jr. stands trial in November on charges of raping and sexually abusing and torturing multiple young girls, prosecutors want to introduce evidence of other similar crimes.
District Attorney Spencer Walker last week filed a motion stating they want to introduce evidence Andrews sexually abused other young girls, crimes for which they were never charged. The evidence, they wrote, would "establish the Defendant's motive and unnatural sexual desire for underage girls."
Some of the abuse, the filing states, was witnessed by Andrews' daughter.
Andrews is expected to stand trial Nov. 16 on charges involving multiple minors in the late 80s and into the 90s when they were pastored of the First United Pentacostal Church in Thomasville and principal of Faith Christian Academy.
In September, one of Andrews' accusers shared with AL.com their story of alleged abuse.
The day after the story was published, the judge in the case issued a gag order preventing attorneys and witnesses in the case from talking with reporters or posting details of the case on social media.
Walker plans to introduce evidence of other crimes allegedly committed by Andrews, an Oct. 23 filing states. The filing does not indicate why charges were not filed in the cases.
"Although the alleged acts occurred over the course of years, all of the victims were approximately the same age at the time of the acts; and in many of these instances, the acts occurred inside the Defendant's church office," the filing states.
The other alleged crimes include:
"The State expects to introduce evidence that while on a church trip to Texas; the Defendant sexually abused P.P.B., who was at the time a minor under the age of 16, while in a car on said trip," a court filing states.
"This act was allegedly witnessed by the daughter of the Defendant.
"Further, the State expects to introduce evidence that the Defendant sexually abused P.P.B., who was at the time a minor under the age of 16, while at their home next to Larry Walters Furniture in Thomasville, Alabama. This act was also witnessed by the daughter of the Defendant."
The evidence they plan to present, they wrote, "would indicate that the Defendant committed sexual abuse against L. H., a child under the age of 16 at the time of the alleged act...
"The instances of abuse involving L.H., are so similar in nature and character that they clearly establish the Defendant's motive and unnatural sexual desire for underage girls," the motion continues.
"L.H. describes incidences that occurred inside the Defendant's church office when they were 12 years old.
"During the first incident, the Defendant touched the buttocks of L.H. with their hand. About two weeks later in the church office, L.H. alleges that the Defendant fondled them breast.
The Defendant often would tell L.H. that they were "sexy."
"He would often request that they give them their insulin shot, then unzip, unbutton and pull their pants down.
"On one occasion, L.H., went in the Defendant's church office to take out the trash. The Defendant told them to "grab it", they thought referring to the trash. They went around their desk, and the Defendant had their penis in their hand.
"All of the incidences described by L.H. occurred during the same time period as some of the incidences involved in the cases for which the Defendant is charged. Further, several of the incidences for which the Defendant is charged occurred in their church office."
Ruan Pienaar: Why Ulster have only themselves to blame BelfastTelegraph.co.uk Ulster's last great home-grown scrum-half, Colin Patterson, has said more should have been done to develop a local successor to Ruan Pienaar. https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/rugby/ulster-rugby/ruan-pienaar-why-ulster-have-only-themselves-to-blame-35015306.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article35015398.ece/32aa5/AUTOCROP/h342/in7s%20Run%20714JPG_2.jpg

Ulster's last great home-grown scrum-half, Colin Patterson, has said more should have been done to develop a local successor to Ruan Pienaar.
The Springbok superstar will leave Kingspan next summer with former Lions tourist Patterson wondering why more indigenous nines have not emerged in that time.
"There's obviously a reason behind it," said the legendary Irish international.
"New Zealand can produce scrum-half after scrum-half after scrum-half. If they can do it, why can't we? It's not a case of why can't we, it's why aren't we. There are certain things to be done to produce more of our own that we're just not doing.
"If we're going to develop our own, then we need to put coaching systems in place that produce the very best."
With still a year to go until their IRFU-enforced exit, Pienaar will take the field tonight when Ulster get their Guinness PRO12 campaign underway against Newport Gwent Dragons at Kingspan Stadium (7.35pm KO).
Elsewhere, however, an injury crisis has forced Director of Rugby Les Kiss to hand a debut to Academy prop Ross Kane.
Rodney Ah You, a summer arrival from champions Connacht, showed "delayed onset concussive symptoms" after last week's friendly win over Northampton Saints meaning they join Wiehahn Herbst, Ricky Lutton and Johnny Simpson on the sidelines.
Georgian international Anton Peikrishvili will arrive shortly to offer temporary relief but is not in contention for tonight.
"It's a good opportunity for Ross," said Kiss. "He came off the bench against Northampton and did a good job for us. It's not ideal, your four front-line tight-head props out of action but, look, the IRFU have been helpful (allowing Peikrishvili's signing) and it's good for Ross to be exposed to another level."
Kane will not be the only man enjoying their competitive Ulster debut with All Black Charles Piutau and out-half Brett Herron joining them in making their maiden PRO12 appearances.
The hosts have also been able to welcome Irish trio Craig Gilroy, Stuart Olding and Sean Reidy back into the fold after their summer exertions with the national team in South Africa.

The Shonen Jump breaks are commonplace at this time of year for the holidays. Eiichiro Oda, author of One Piece, will also be working on the upcoming One Piece Film Gold as an executive producer. They took similar breaks prior to One Piece Strong World and One Piece Film Z, where they also served as an executive producer.
In addition, as revealed in an interview between Eiichiro Oda and their editor, Oda usually sleeps from 2:00 am to 5:00 am, and according to former Japanese Weekly Shonen Jump Editor-in-Chief Hisashi Sasaki's interview with the One Piece Podcast, they even sometimes goes without sleep for several days when working on the manga all-day round.
The One Piece Podcast will be off on December 14th as well, but we will return for our season finale on December 21st which will include special guests, a recap of One Piece Chapter 810, our countdown of the top moments of 2015, and a lot more! We will then return on January 4, 2016 with our Jump Festa recap.
Over on Wareable, for the last 20 weeks I've been documenting my experience with building a smart home from scratch. I bought a run-down house and, when it was being renovated and decorated, I also took the opportunity to seamlessly install as much smart tech as possible, while at the same time future-proofing it for what's still to come with the connected home.
Here's what I learned along the way…
Don't go totally wireless
Install a heck of a lot of Ethernet around your house. Wireless may be the future, but wired is definitely the most reliable option. If you've got exposed walls, you can bury Cat6 cable before the plasterer comes in and does their thing. And don't hold back.
Run a couple of lengths to all the rooms in your house. After all, Cat6 is good for more than just data – it can carry digital TV signals too.
Beware of a busy network
You're Wi-Fi network is going to get congested. So make sure you check the best channel to have your system working on. There's plenty of free software out there to do that (and built in utilities in both Mac OS X and Windows).
I installed a Sonos system and that caused a few issues until I added a Sonos Boost to the mix to create a separate network for my connected speakers.
In the UK, the new Sky Q system is also brilliant for creating a mesh network. My Sky Q system comprises of a Silver box and two mini boxes, plus the router, giving my connected tech eight access points to the web, using both 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals.
There are alternatives to this – Apple's Airport devices do something similar and smart wireless routing system Eero started shipping earlier this year.
Don't fret about platforms
Smart home connectivity is a confusing muddle for the average consumer. Works with Nest, HomeKit, Wink, Z-Wave, Zigbee, SmartThings, Brillo… These are just a handful of the platforms and standards of the smart home.
But don't worry about them. Apple, Google, Samsung and many other big tech names all want a piece of the smart home pie. And, as the genre is still finding its feet, no-one has really set the standard yet.
You've no doubt read how the fragmentation of the smart home will be its downfall… but that's not really the case. Many of the devices work across multiple platforms. Philips Hue, for example, lets you control your smart bulbs, officially, using Android and iOS and there are a number of third-party apps for Linux, Windows, Mac and more. Philips Hue also 'Works with HomeKit' and 'Works with Nest'.
Google's Nest Thermostat can be controlled by iOS devices, as well as Android, and while you might not get the single command luxury that HomeKit affords Nest rival Honeywell, you can always cook up IFTTT recipes.
Even Samsung, traditionally a shut up shop with its kit, knows that limiting people to one brand in the home is a bad idea. Samsung SmartThings is an open platform lets you control hundreds of connected devices from other companies.
Start with the essentials
The key smart home tech, the stuff that really works is stuff you'd normally consider quite boring: lighting, heating and security. But it really is all much more exciting and useful when connected.
Personally, I went down the Nest route for my ‘essentials'. I've got the full suite of Nest products; a Thermostat, three Protects and two Cams. It's great to have it all grouped into one easy-to-use app and it's not that hard to add my Hue bulbs to the mix, or get my Nest kit working nicely with my smart doorbell and locks.
Avoid novelty items
Do you really need a coffee machine that turns on when your Jawbone registers you as awake? Or a washing machine that texts you when it's finished spinning? No, thought not. Avoid gimmicky smart items that don't do anything to streamline your life.
The Brewers have claimed Adam Walker off waivers from the Twins, according to Phil Miller of the Star Tribune (via Twitter). The 25-year-old, who is a Milwaukee native, was a third-round draft pick back in 2012.
Walker has long shown impressive power in the minors, with 124 total home runs in their five professional seasons. But they have yet to earn a trip up to the majors due to questions surrounding the rest of their game.
At the plate, Walker racks up an enormous number of strikeouts. At Triple-A last year, they managed a .243/.305/.479 slash and 27 bombs. But they also went down on strikes 202 times in 532 plate appearances, making for a cringe-worthy 38.0% K rate.
It'll be interesting to see what kind of opportunity Walker will receive with the Brewers. He's bound to draw comparisons to current first baseman Chris Carter, who has a similar profile. Indeed, with Carter's arbitration price tag projected to rise to $8.1MM due to their voluminous home run output, it's possible that the club could ship them out and instead go with the younger, cheaper Walker — though they have played only in the outfield as a professional. Carrying both on the MLB roster, or stashing Walker at Triple-A, are also certainly plausible outcomes as well.
Fifteen-year-olds here experience more bullying than their peers in 50 other countries and economies, and only the children of Latvia and New Zealand have it worse, said a study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The findings were released in the third volume of data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa), a three-yearly study run by the OECD.
In the study conducted in 2015, students were asked to report how frequently they were exposed to six different types of bullying according to a four-point scale, ranging from "never or almost never" to "once a week or more". The six categories were: being left out, made fun of, threatened, property taken by other students, being hit or pushed around, and having nasty rumours spread about them. They measured physical, verbal and relational bullying, like social exclusion.
The countries were ranked according to an index based on an aggregate of the responses. Britain was sixth-worst, Finland was 14th and Hong Kong 16th. The least bullying was reported in South Korea.
In Singapore, 5,825 students, randomly selected from 168 public schools, and 290 students from nine private schools, took the computer-based test.
The most common form of bullying experienced by students here was being made fun of by other students, with 18.3 per cent saying they experienced this at least a few times a month. The OECD average was 10.9 per cent.

This was followed by 11.9 per cent saying they were left out of things on purpose at least a few times a month, compared with the OECD average of 7.2 per cent.
Close to 9 per cent said others had spread nasty rumours about them at a similar frequency. Those who were hit or pushed around by others, or had belongings taken away or destroyed at least a few times a month, made up 5.1 per cent, while 4.4 per cent said they were threatened by other students at the same frequency. Singapore also had 14.5 per cent of students who described being frequently bullied, compared with the OECD average of 8.9 per cent.
The Pisa study suggested that in Singapore, bullying could be more frequent in schools where teachers were perceived as being unfair, and where schools have a poor disciplinary climate, causing students to be more likely to engage in high-risk behaviour.
Teachers who are seen as unfair may humiliate students or undermine their self-confidence, and these students then try to assert their superiority over vulnerable groups to regain their confidence.

A top official in Boston Mayor Martin Walsh's administration pleaded not guilty on Thursday to a corruption charge that could lead to a maximum of 20 years in prison.
Kenneth Brissette, the city's director of tourism, sports, and entertainment, was arrested for allegedly withholding city permits from a music festival until union workers were hired to staff the event in 2014.
A federal indictment released Thursday outlined allegations that Brissette had engaged in union-related extortion.
The Boston Globe reported "federal authorities were investigating whether Brissette had pressured organizers of Boston Calling, a biannual festival held at City Hall Plaza, to use union labor."
The festival, which was held in September 2014, had originally employed non-union workers.
Brissette allegedly withheld the permits until festival organizers hired union workers from the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Local 11. Three days before the opening, Boston Calling entered a contract and hired Local 11 laborers. The necessary permits were not granted to the festival until afterward.
Brissette and Walsh contend that the city did nothing illegal, although at least one other City Hall employee reportedly urged the festival to hire union workers. The firm representing Brissette called the indictment "factually and legally flawed."
In a statement released after the indictment, Walsh said they are "deeply concerned about today's news."
"Everyone who knows Ken knows them to be a good and hardworking person. We will continue to work with the U.S. Attorney's Office to get to the bottom of this," they said.
This is not the first time Brissette has been linked to alleged union intimidation tactics. In 2014, Brissette allegedly warned restaurants that Teamsters members planned to disrupt filming of the reality TV show Top Chef, which had hired non-union labor. The resulting disruption led to five charges of extortion against Teamsters members. Brissette was not charged in the incident.
Brissette has been released from jail on a $25,000 bond and has been placed on paid on administrative leave from their job with the city. The case will continue until July 12.

Instructions
Zoom appends html inside the element it is assigned to, so that element has to be able to accept html, like <a> , <span> , <li> , <div> , etc. This excludes <img> elements (see below).
$( document ).ready( function ( ) { $( 'a.photo' ).zoom({url: 'photo-big.jpg' }); }); $( document ).ready( function ( ) { $( 'a.photo' ).zoom({ url: 'photo-big.jpg' , callback: function ( ) { $( this ).colorbox({href: this .src}); } }); });
To use Zoom with img elements, they will need to be wrapped with another element. It is impossible to read some layout related CSS styles from JavaScript (percent-based width and height, margins set to auto, etc.) so the safe thing to do is to defer this change to individual site owners. The following is all that is needed in some cases:
$( document ).ready( function ( ) { $( 'img' ) .wrap( '<span style="display:inline-block"></span>' ) .css( 'display' , 'block' ) .parent() .zoom(); });
Removing Zoom
Trigger the zoom.destroy event to remove zoom from an element:
$( '#example' ).zoom(); $( '#example' ).trigger( 'zoom.destroy' );

Well, you don't see that every day - Apple has rushed out a patch to fix a major security bug.
It had been revealed that users of its new macOS High Sierra operating system can access it without using a password.
Just use "root" as a username, leave the password field blank and hit "Enter" a few times.
It's an embarrassing slip-up and not one user are used to from Apple, whose products are often cited as more reliable and secure than its rivals'.
Indeed, the firm admitted that it had "stumbled" with the release of High Sierra.
"We greatly regret this error and we apologise to all Mac users, both for releasing with this vulnerability and for the concern it has caused.
"Our customers deserve better.
"We are auditing our development processes to help prevent this from happening again," the company's statement said.
But the "root" password bug is not as isolated a case as it might at first seem.
Last month, Apple had to release a patch for another password-related issue in High Sierra.
Some users found that when they asked the software for a password hint it simply revealed the password in full instead.
While High Sierra appears to be falling over itself to give users access, there have also been issues with iOS - the software on iPhones and iPads.
Earlier this month, iPhone users were frustrated by an irritating bug that caused the letter "i" to be inexplicably auto-corrected to a capital "a" and a question mark.
Again, Apple promptly fixed things. But these cases have left some questioning whether the firm has lowered its standards.
"Apple's quality of business execution is slipping," says Neil Mawston, at Strategy Analytics. They believe the company is becoming "more prone" to business and product glitches.
As a result, Mr Mawston thinks Apple's reputation for offering premium quality and reliability could be at risk.
Bug bounty
Cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward, at the University of Surrey, agrees.
"There's definitely a growing perception that perhaps their quality control is not all it should be," they say.
"I use Apple products... because of the level of encryption and the attention they pay to apps in their app store. You didn't use to get these sorts of bugs."
They also point out that while Apple was once a niche brand favoured largely by computing connoisseurs in a handful of industries, today it is a true giant.
That makes its devices increasingly attractive targets for hackers, who tend to look for vulnerabilities in the most popular systems because that way they have more opportunities to scam people or steal vulnerable data.
"People are clearly probing to see if there are interesting back doors out there [in Apple products]," says Prof Woodward. "And, boy, are there."
But perhaps that growth in popularity has also changed how we perceive Apple software bugs, suggests Ian Fogg, at IHS Technology.
The company will ship 88 million iPhones this quarter, along with millions more iPads and Macs, they explain.

"At that kind of scale, a problem that affects even a small number of people in percentage terms affects a lot of people in absolute terms - that's the issue Apple faces," they say.
The company should still be considered a purveyor of high-quality devices, they say, adding that there remain regular reports of security issues with Google and Microsoft products.
"When a patch does come through [for an iPhone] it gets pushed out very quickly," points out Mr Fogg.
Android phones, in contrast, are not as easy for Google to update en masse because a wide range of different Android versions are used in the wild and only phones made by Google itself receive the most important security updates immediately.
There is a specific list of handsets that receive monthly security updates - but this is far from all Android devices out there.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Android phones don't all receive security updates at the same time
Mr Fogg also says that the iPhone bug that caused the letter "i" to be needlessly auto-corrected is particularly interesting because it appears to have been the result of a machine learning-based approach to spell-checking that went wrong.
Automating processes will be increasingly common in software development, says Mr Fogg, as it can speed up product delivery - but giving an algorithm control does have its downside.
"It's increasingly hard for companies to know that it will work well as it learns," they add.
The bottom line is: perceptions matter and Apple will want to deal with any signs that quality control is slipping quickly, says Ben Wood at CCS Insight.
"Apple has built its business on a reputation for high-quality, easy-to-use devices with great customer service.
"It will be troubled by these recent issues and it is doubtless moving mountains to fix the High Sierra bug - in particular to ensure macOS is secure for users."
Youth media publications, Vice, Broadsheet, Pedestrian.TV, Junkee, and FBi Radio, have teamed up to encourage young Australians to enrol, or check their enrolment details, ahead of the postal plebiscite for marriage equality.
Between 5 and 8pm this evening, VICE Australia and FBi Radio will black out their websites, blocking access to content and running a message urging readers to spend time registering and/or checking voting details.
Pedestrian.TV and Junkee readers will black out all advertising units and host over-the-top placements which direct readers to the Australian Electoral Commission Website.

All content upload during the period of time will relate to LGBTQI+ issues.
Broadsheet will run a takeover across its five city websites, directing readers to AEC before all pages.
All media outlets will also dedicate their social platforms to support of the message.
Maddison Connaughton, features editor, Vice Australia said it was the first time Australia's youth publishers had joined together for a cause.
“We know the vote has been purposefully designed to disenfranchise young people, said Connaughton.
“There are hundreds of thousands of people under 30 who aren't enrolled to vote, and many more who don't have a permanent address, or are travelling, or are overseas. But we don't accept that as the end of the story. These young people can make or break this marriage equality postal survey. So our goal with this blackout is to get every young person in Australia signed up to vote.”
Nick Shelton, publisher at Broadsheet, said the company felt privileged to support something they “passionately believed in.”
Pedestrian.TV's head of editorial, Vanessa Lawrence, said it was more important than ever for organisations to come together and spread the message.
“Pedestrian.TV is proud to be involved in this joint initiative, as we continue to utilise our significant influence to help educate and inform our readers on the best ways to rally behind the fight for marriage equality in Australia,” Lawrence said.
Tim Duggan, publisher at Junkee Media said the youth publishers will be advocating for same-sex marriage, “loudly and proudly.”
“Junkee Media is a proud supporter of marriage equality. As a publisher for young Australians, we reflect the majority view of our audience that all Australians deserve the right to marry whoever they love,” Duggan said.
“Junkee believes the voluntary postal survey is an unnecessary, expensive and potentially damaging debate for many LGBTI people, and we will be advocating loudly and proudly for our audience to vote yes and ensure they are enrolled and ready to vote when the day comes.”
Caroline Gates, program director, FBi radio, said it was important to show support for FBi volunteers, artists, musicians, and listeners, who are part of the LGBTQI+ community.
“There are thousands of young people missing from the electoral roll. We need our audience of 18-24 year olds to be heard in this debate and we want ‘yes' to win. Together we'll bring forward the day when all Australians can marry the person they love.”
Youth mental health organisation headspace, Perth's RTRFM, The Ethics Centre, and Amnesty International Australia, will support the campaign.
The news comes after members of the advertising industry joined together two weeks ago, pledging not to create the ‘No campaign.'
At the same time, most media companies said they would accept advertising for both campaigns, independent publishers said they would not be accepting advertising for the ‘No' campaign.
Last week, The Australian Bureau of Statistics released its first ad explaining the postal plebiscite on same-sex marriage and detailing the cut-off date for enrolment.
The Hokkaido Ham Fighters' never-say-die attitude culminated in a Japan Series title on Saturday night in Hiroshima.
Hideki Kuriyama lauded their team's resilience after Nippon Ham clinched its third title in franchise history with a 10-4 win over the Hiroshima Carp in Game 6.
During the regular season, the Fighters were down, but not out, in the Pacific League pennant race. They erased what was once an 11½-game deficit to the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks to win the league title, and used the perks they earned to beat the Hawks again in the Climax Series.
“I said it when we won the league championship, we had such a tough season, but we didn't give up, even though we had a huge deficit to overcome, and we made it all the way here, said Kuriyama. “We grew a little in every single game.”
Never give up, never give in, never say die.
The Fighters lived by that creed, united in the belief no mountain was so high it couldn't be scaled.
So when Nippon Ham faced adversity in the form of a Carp team that held a 2-0 lead in the Japan Series, and was looking as if it might snatch a third in Sapporo behind veteran pitcher Hiroki Kuroda, there was no panic. The Fighters rallied to win Game 3 in 10 innings, and just kept on winning.
“The two games we lost and the games in Sapporo, those could've gone either way,” Kuriyama said.
Game 6 could've as well, until the Fighters finally scored a KO in the eighth inning.
The score was tied at 4-4 when Nippon Ham strung together three two-out singles to load the bases. From there, Sho Nakata drew a walk, reliever Anthony Bass drove in a run and Brandon Laird hit a grand slam. All of a sudden, the Fighters were up 10-4 and their hard work was six outs away from paying off.
Nippon Ham's triumph required the contributions of a number of players. That was no more apparent than in the bullpen, where the relievers stepped up to face down the Carp hitters, who as a group were statistically the best in Japan.
“It's a humbling experience to be down there,” said Bass, who was chosen as one of the outstanding players of the series. “There are a lot of great pitchers in the bullpen. We picked each other up all series long. I was just fortunate enough to kind of have, if you want to say the hot hand, but it's been a fun season.
“Credit to the Carp's bullpen, they've been lock-down all year. They've got a great bullpen. It's just we got things going our way at the end. Everyone's just kind of been doing their job.”
With the bullpen keeping things close, the Fighters eventually found the big hits they needed. Shohei Otani came up with the first, a walk-off single in Game 3. Then it was Laird hitting a two-run homer in the eighth inning of Game 4. Those two hits came after game-tying hits by Sho Nakata. Then in Game 5, Haruki Nishikawa put Nippon Ham in the driver's seat with a sayonara grand slam.
Before the series, all the focus was on Otani, who had an 11-strikeout performance, though while allowing three runs, in Game 1 (his only appearance on the mound) and finished the series with four doubles among their six hits at the plate.
Otani played a role, but it was the sum of the Fighters' parts, coming through in big moments, that added up.
The Fighters simply made more plays when it counted. There was Luis Mendoza throwing five heroic innings of relief in Game 5, and Bass shining in each of their appearances to the tune of three wins. When the Fighters needed big hits at home, Nakata was there to deliver, and third-base coach Kazuyuki Shirai's call to send Kensuke Tanaka home on Hiromi Oka's shallow sacrifice fly to tie Game 5 in the seventh inning was among the most pivotal of the series. And those were just the tip of the iceberg.
Kuriyama preached belief after the game. The Fighters always believed the turning point was right around the corner, and four out of six times in this Japan Series it was.
They believed in one another, and believed that together there was no deficit that couldn't be overcome.
As it turns out, as the Hawks and Carp can both attest to, that turned out to be true, and the Fighters now have the titles to prove it.
“This is a young team and we had to move forward together and we could not have won unless each one of us grew,” Kuriyama said. “So even though we became the best in Japan, we still have a long way to go. We are going to keep moving forward from tomorrow.”
Jeff Bunker spends a large portion of their day playing with toys. One minute he'll be thinking up new poses for Mickey Mouse and the next he'll be detailing the newest Darth Vader combo attack. He's a lucky man.
Bunker has been the VP of art direction for Avalanche Studios for nearly 20 years and when it was acquired by the Walt Disney Company they began work on some intriguing new projects. One of these projects was the highly ambitious Disney Infinity, a toys-to-life title that brought various Disney-owned IPs into a virtual toy box. Since its initial launch in 2013 the series has gone on to sell millions of copies and corresponding figures, and is currently about to launch the new 3.0 edition which focuses on the Star Wars universe.
I sat down with Jeff to discuss their process and the newest Infinity iteration.  They are involved in all figure development, as well as the in-game mechanics for current and upcoming characters. This is no small feat, especially considering the outrageous amount of characters produced for each Disney Infinity title. In fact Bunker is the big man in charge of actually picking which characters, new and old, make the final cut. I asked how they chose each character, those from the distant Disney past and present, to add to the roster every Disney Infinity season.
“You know that really comes from our community,” Bunker professed, “We really try to pay attention to what they're telling us. We watch the forums and we have the community leaders that we've hired internally that listen to the fans. We just try to draw as much of our selection from our fans. That's the number one places that we try to get our information.”

In fact Disney recently launched their “Player's Pick 2015” where Infinity enthusiasts can vote for their most wanted character by name. The ballot is chalked full of Disney favorites that span the company's long history. The top two nominees, by a staggering margin, are currently the always dangerous Darkwing Duck and the adorable Mabel Pines of Gravity Falls. Bunker assured me both characters have fans on the inside as well and that they wouldn't be surprised to see them pop up in the future.
Though when I asked if winning the “Player's Pick” meant a promised spot in a future Disney Infinity title Bunker acknowledged, “It's weighted heavily. They may pick a character that they really would like, but we may struggle find a really good gameplay mechanic for. So it's not a given.” Even Bunker themselves has favorites, citing that they would love to see Kronk and Ezma of The Emperor's New Groove show up in the future.

And while fan involvement seems to play a big part when it comes to who makes the cut, Disney isn't one to shy away from the business aspects of any project. Many of the characters who make their Disney gaming debut are selected by filmmakers who think their properties would be a good fit for the ever-expanding sandbox world. Bunker explained that internally the team talks about which characters they feel would work best and bring fresh gameplay mechanics, while also representing a chosen franchise.
Once a character is selected the creative team at Disney starts the arduous process of choosing a proper design and figure pose. From the start, Bunker and their crew approach all aspects artistically, studying the source material and noting the iconic aspects. In their mind these figures are works of art—small sculptures for fans and players alike.
Once a few sketches have been fleshed out they are sent to the actual filmmakers or creators for input. Many times filmmakers have a much different take on how their character should act or look. “And so we go back and forth,” Bunker explains, “We take their feedback and we do the pose again. Try to incorporate what they're telling us that would feel more appropriate for the character and over time we eventually get something that we're happy with and they're happy with. We always feel that if we're making the creator of that character happy we're making the fans of that character happy as well.”

Speaking of making fans happy, a few weeks back the Infinity team finally announced a tie in many had been awaiting — Kingdom Hearts. The announcement came during Disney's D23 expo, and attendees even walked away with a special Kingdom Hearts power disc which would transform everyone's favorite Disney icon into the daring King Mickey. The fabled Keyblade was also announced as an ultimate unlockable item, one that could only be used when players registered every figure the game had to offer in it's prestigious “Hall of Heroes”. I asked Bunker if we would see more of Kingdom Hearts in the future and they just laughed, stating that their team was aware of the hype surrounding the series and were taking it into consideration.
As mentioned above, the third Disney Infinity will have a strong focus on the fan=obsessed sci-fi juggernaut Star Wars. There are hardly any franchises in the universe (pun intended) as iconic and Bunker was excited about the opportunity to handle both classic and contemporary characters. As they do with all figures, the beginning of the Star Wars process dealt with taking a lot of cues from Lucasfilm, with the same thought that what made them happy would also resonate with fans.

We've already gotten a glimpse of figures in action (and in their iconic poses) so it's nice to know that Disney really did their homework when it came time to get Star Wars right. Even the newly announced Finn and Rey figures from the upcoming Force Awakens look the part.
In fact, in the near future Infinity will be releasing their first line of “LightFX” Star Wars figures, each with their own glowing lightsaber. “There are just six of them that we're doing. It's certainly not all of the figures,” Bunker assured, “We narrowed it down to six that made sense to us. And our thought there was that we don't want to do anything contrived. We don't want to start making Elsa's eyes glow or anything. As we were working on those characters we thought, ‘Man… these are lightsabers! It certainly isn't contrived to light them up.' It was just something that came up while we were working on the original figures and it made sense to us.”

On the topic of Star Wars I asked bunker who their favorite character was from the nearly a dozen that would launch in wave one of Infinity 3.0. After the hemming and hawing that a parent might go through when asked to pick their favorite child, they settled on Yoda. “He's just such a blast in-game. He's super quick with their combat, he's very good with their force attacks, and he's just a lot of fun to play with. I also think they came out pretty sharp in the figure department,” Bunker admits.
They also mention two of the lesser known characters, Sebine Wren and Zeb Orrelios (concept art and figures seen above), both from the recent Star Wars Rebels cartoons series. Bunker considers them both dark horses due to their lesser known status, but feels that many will become fans of their characters through the game.

As I mentioned in the opening, Bunker is in charge of the characters both in and out of the game. After discussing Yoda's quick combat skills and the newly implemented force mechanics we discussed how combat has evolved over the years within the world of Disney Infinity. It may be a game targeted at children, but it's no slouch in the action department. It's probably the only game in existence that can legally feature a fight between the Hulk and Obi-Wan Kenobi. And who wouldn't want to see that?

Bunker states that the combat in Infinity 3.0 has been improved substantially from past iterations. They describe it as “satisfying and fluid”, which makes me very hopeful. As someone who mashed their way through the last two Infinity titles, it would be nice to actually chain together a few combo attacks when fighting new enemies. The force mechanics are also a point of pride, as Bunker explained how players can use them as both an attack and a defensive maneuver to gain better footing. It's a Star Wars game after all, you have to have some solid force combat.

With our time at an end I asked Bunker why they thought folks would be drawn to the newest Infinity title. They didn't hesitate for a moment. “I think considering 1.0 was an amazingly innovative and fun game. From Disney Infinity 1.0 to 2.0 to 3.0 I really can't think of a system that we haven't enhanced and improved. So what was already a very strong game, I think we've made it much more accessible and fun. It's easier to access what's available to you as a player, especially in the Toy Box. The series started out great and we've made it much better over the years.”
It's nice to see the team behind a series with such potential and such a big fanbase has put so much time and effort into making sure their games improve and expand. Especially when the company behind it is a powerhouse like Disney. Here's hoping that Disney Infinity 3.0 is the best so far.

Image caption HIV can be spread via blood and bodily secretions
A doubling of new HIV infections in the UK in the past decade is leading experts to tell GPs to offer testing to all adult male patients in some areas.
Health Protection Agency data shows new UK-acquired cases rose from just under 2,000 in 2001 to nearly 3,800 in 2010.
Many of these new cases are among men who have sex with men and it is this group that campaigners hope to target.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has launched new guidelines for doctors in England.
Routine testing
NICE says GPs should now offer and recommend HIV testing to all men who register with a practice in an area with a large community of men who have sex with men or an area that has a high prevalence of HIV - meaning more than two diagnosed cases per 1,000 people.
Hospital doctors should follow similar advice for any men admitted to their hospital.
These expanded HIV testing policies should be prioritised for implementation as soon as possible Dr Valerie Delpech , Head of HIV surveillance at the HPA
Increased testing should help stop the spread of HIV by identifying men at risk, NICE believes.
Men who have sex with men remain the group most at risk of becoming infected with HIV.
New diagnoses in this group alone have increased by 70% in the past 10 years.
There are more than 30,000 men who have sex with men living with HIV in the UK and experts estimate nearly a third of these are currently undiagnosed and unaware that they are infected.
Another high-risk group that would benefit from increased HIV testing, according to NICE, is the black African community living in England.
In 2009, more than 2,000 black Africans were diagnosed with an HIV infection, one-third of all new diagnoses in the UK.

Professor Mike Kelly from NICE said: "HIV is still a serious problem in this country, with a large proportion of people unaware they are infected.
"This new guidance from NICE makes a number of practical recommendations which aim to increase HIV testing by encouraging healthcare professionals to offer it routinely to people in areas where there are a high number of people living with HIV."
This would include parts of large cities like London and Manchester, as well as areas like Brighton and Hove.
Dr Valerie Delpech, head of HIV surveillance at the HPA, said: "These expanded HIV testing policies should be prioritised for implementation as soon as possible.
"The impact of late diagnosis is clearly demonstrated when you look at deaths among people with HIV - three out of five of HIV-positive individuals that die are diagnosed too late to gain the most health benefits from their treatment, like increased life expectancy."
HIV charities said the guidelines were a "vital step forward".
Considering the popularity of the dark knight and their prevalence throughout Lego sets, movies, and games, Batman is constantly being depicted in fan creations–as is their ever changing Batcave. From Lego's own 60's cave, to vintage versions, and to some consisting of 20,000 pieces, each Batcave is designed to be uniquely different but equally evocative of the Bat's style. Dan Glasure was aware of these differing takes, and incorporated design styles from other caves and incarnations to build their own striking Batcave, one that took two months to complete – but was clearly well worth the effort.
While most Batcave designs tend to spread out horizontally, Dan's cave is scrunched into a deep thin cavern. From the highest point, where the most modern amenities rest (such as the Batmobile and Batwing) to the deepest level featuring preexisting wood structures, this cave is packed full of detail.
To help differentiate their Batcave from others, Dan focused in on certain aspects of the Dark Knight's character, and then expanded upon them. In this case, Batman's penchant for investigation:
“When I set out to build our Batcave MOC, I was well aware there was already some stunning MOC's out there. So my goal was never ‘to be the biggest or best'. Rather, I simply hoped to take a little different approach. My thought was to have a ‘working' Batcave. I wanted it to look as if this was where ‘The World's Greatest Detective' spent a lot of time. Perhaps in their workshop, or in their labs, or working on turbine engines for their vehicles (though maybe that's Alfred's job!).”
-Dan Glasure
Utilizing lights, Dan also easily highlights sections of a normally dark cave – areas such as the Batcomputer, the Bat-Laboratory, and Bat-Arsenal. The build also includes popular Batcave sections such as a waterfall and sewer entrance. No doubt, this is one Bat-home any comic fan would enjoy.
A new report reveals that investment in sensor modules is heating up the Internet of Things (IoT) space, with innovative sensor startups winning the bulk of that money.
As reported by Smart Cities World, a new study by Lux Research examined the $4.3 billion in funding for sensor modules over the past decade. The report titled “Sensors Innovation: Analyzing Investment Trends Across the $4.3 Billion Spend” found investment in innovative sensors tripled in the past 10 years, with North America dominating.
Investment in innovative sensors attracted a dominant 80% of the total, or $3.4 billion, which underscores the increasing importance of IoT technology.
See also: Navigant sees four-fold sensor market growth through 2025
The increased investment in innovative sensors comes as this new technology is becoming integral to growth in such areas as smart cities, autonomous vehicles and wearables.
“Innovative sensor start-ups will continue to attract large amounts of venture investment as the Internet of Things emerges as the next major phase in computing, following on the heels of the PC and mobile eras,” said report author Pallavi Madakasira.
Total innovative sensor investment tripled in the past decade, attracting $486 million in funding in 2015. Between 2006 and 2015, sensor processing-related technologies drew investment of $620 million, with over $200 million going toward packaging solutions and nearly $100 million for developers of energy harvesting.
The report further broke down the sensor space investment patterns between 2006 and the first quarter of 2016.
It found that North America remains the dominant region worldwide with $3.4 billion, or 80%, of all sensor technology investment since 2006. This investment was generated by more than 340 active companies across the Americas.
Sensors big in EMEA region, too
In other regions, $950 million in investment was drawn by the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, while $200 million was invested in Asia.
Global acquisitions over this period were dominated by innovative sensors. A total of 45 sensor developers were acquired, worth $1.5 billion in deals, over the course of the decade. Meanwhile, acquisitions of processing and packaging solutions startups only comprised a small amount of buyout activity.
Lastly, Lux Research found that corporate players were showing unprecedented commitment to sensor technology.
Notably, Samsung has earmarked $13 billion for sensor-related investment, while Sony is allocating $4 billion to increased sensor production.
Other noteworthy investments include Panasonic's $780 million for image sensors, IBM's $3 billion for sensor data technology and Ford Motors which launched an R&D facility that will focus on transportation-related sensors.

Mums have urgently warned fellow parents over the dangers of fidget spinners - after the handy gadgets allegedly EXPLODED in their kitchens.
Fidget spinners burst on to the scene earlier this year and rapidly gained popularity amongst children.
The toy - which is believed to help focus the mind - works by users holding it between their fingers, flicking it and watching it go.
Spinners are quite small and can conveniently fit into pockets - which is perhaps part of the reason they have become so popular.
But parents are being warned over their dangers in the wake of reported incidents which saw the gadgets combust.
Both spinners were Bluetooth enabled with speakers that can play music - and both blew up within 45 minutes of being plugged in.
(Image: Addictive Fidget Toys)
One mum, Kimberley, told WBRC: "I was downstairs and all I heard was, 'fire, fire'.
"The fidget spinner wasn't smoking, it was in flames.
"I just really want people to be aware of this because a lot of people have been inboxing me reaching out to me leaving messages saying my child has this same fidget spinner.
"Anytime, you have anything that needs to be charged, we really need to be paying attention to the manufacturers of these, doing our research."
(Image: Addictive Fidget Toys)
Michelle Carr told WEYI: "Right here in this book case, I could see the reflection.
"The fidget spinner was on fire on my counter.
"It's the same cord I use for my baby monitor and I just simply had it plugged in like this and it was laying right here on fire."
(Image: Addictive Fidget Toys)
The Consumer Product Safety Commission told Gizmodo: "Never charge a product with batteries overnight while you are sleeping.
"Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and use the charger from the manufacturer that is designed specifically for your device.
"CPSC is also investigating reported incidents involving children and fidget spinners.
"We advise parents to keep fidget spinners away from young children, because they can choke on small parts. Warn older children not to put fidget spinners in their mouths."
International terrorism expert Peter Neumann has warned Europe to expect an increasing number of attacks, as Friday's truck terror in Stockholm marked the third Islamist atrocity to hit the continent in just three weeks with other deadly assaults taking place in St. Petersburg and London.
“I believe that, more more, ISIS will be using its supporters in Europe to carry out attacks”, the head of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization (ICSR) at King's College in London told ZDF on Monday.
Neumann said it's important that people have a realistic assessment of the threat of Islamist attacks, but insisted “this doesn't mean there are going to be acts of terrorism happening in Europe every day, or that people should be frightened to go out on the street”.
According to the professor, authorities in Europe are generally well-prepared in the fight against Islamist attacks, but they stressed that security services need to keep a closer eye on people deemed to be a potential terror threat.
As well as boosting the resources and capacity of counter-terror bodies, Neumann said it's vital that intelligence agencies leave no threat file unprocessed.
“You need to have a concrete, integrated, systematic approach to prevention,” they added.
Speaking after the Westminster attack in March — in which Muslim convert Khalid Masood mowed down crowds with a vehicle and stabbed a police officer, killing five people and injuring more than fifty — the ICSR chief said that nations in Europe are going to have to learn to live with terror.
“Just because nothing happens for two months doesn't mean the risk of a terror attack being carried out has declined, and this is something we need to adapt to,” they said.
Neumann pointed out that while counter-terror agencies in Britain are far superior to those in most of Europe, the problem is that they don't currently have enough resources to deal with the huge number of threats.

The craving for money yields fantastic devices invented by the best minds capitalism can hire. What is one to make of this: if you earn Britain's average annual income of £26,500 you will pay the basic rate of 20% income tax, but if your income is £6bn you can get away with less than 1% tax, and it's all perfectly legal? Tax avoidance, money laundering, rigging money markets – these are the chosen means of enhancing profits used by many of Britain's biggest companies. Receive child tax credits that are later ruled to have been mistakenly paid and you are relentlessly pursued for every penny, even into the courts, by Them Majesty's Revenue and Customs; make the most minor infraction of the Job Centre's commands and you are sanctioned and denied benefits; head a company with a household name, shift fortunes abroad, out of the government's reach, and you are knighted for services to the country. Trevor Rayne reports.
This November The Guardian published the findings of over 80 journalists in 26 countries working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. They examined 28,000 pages of leaked tax agreements and returns for over 1,000 companies. Most of the documents were Advance Tax Agreements, known as comfort letters, arranged by Britain's biggest accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) with Luxembourg's tax authorities. They are tax avoidance schemes organised for the likes of Ikea, Dyson, Amazon, Pepsi, Heinz, Vodafone, Fiat and so on. Only a third of the documents examined mentioned the sums of money to be moved through Luxembourg but these amounted to $215bn between 2002 and 2010 for PwC clients alone. Companies pay tax rates of 1% on profits shuffled into Luxembourg, although Luxembourg's official corporation tax is 29.2%.
The big four accountancy firms are PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and Ernst and Young. Together in 2013 they employed 750,000 and made £74bn. Globally PwC employed 195,400 people and made £139,153 per employee. These firms audit the books for the giant multinationals and banks; they sit at the centre of finance capital and entwine governments and political parties in their gilded webs. A PwC spokesperson, responding to the findings, said PwC advice was ‘given in accordance with applicable local, European and international tax laws and agreements and is guided by the PwC code of conduct.' These parasites drafted the laws!
British Prime Minister Cameron and Chancellor Osborne say that they will stop the multinationals avoiding taxes. This is for public consumption only; they say something quite different in private and act accordingly. In 2012 Osborne reduced anti-tax avoidance laws aimed at multinational companies and their overseas subsidiaries. For the benefit of companies set up in Luxembourg, Osborne reduced taxes on their profits to no more than 5% (The Guardian 5 November 2014). The intention was to attract multinational companies to Britain, where tax avoidance schemes, such as those practised in Luxembourg, are acceptable. The multinationals then establish subsidiaries abroad, ‘shell companies', abroad through which to transfer their profits.
It is estimated that up to $1trillion is being taken out of underdeveloped countries every year by a network of corrupt activities employing anonymous shell companies. ‘A World Bank report in 2011, found that 70% of the biggest corruption cases between 1980 and 2010 involved anonymous shell companies. The US and UK were among the jurisdictions most frequently used to incorporate legal entities that hold proceeds of corruption,' (Financial Times 17 November 2014). At their November meeting in Brisbane, the G20 leaders declared, ‘We endorse the 2015-16 G20 anti-corruption action plan' to improve transparency against corporate secrecy. Should any of its readers fret about the stated intentions the Financial Times offers reassurance, ‘But doubts remain over the willingness of politicians to undertake effective action. Only a handful of governments has so far acted on similar commitments made more than a decade ago to tighten the rules against money laundering.'
‘A magical fairyland'
Luxembourg is smaller than Kent and has a population of 543,202 people. For every police officer in Luxembourg there are four accountants; they have an awful lot of money to count, some $4 trillion is invested there! Harvard law professor Stephen Shay, testifying to the US Senate on tax avoidance mechanisms, described the Grand Duchy as being ‘like a magical fairyland'. In 2012 bank assets in Luxembourg amounted to 1,725% of its Gross Domestic Product, compared to 549% in Britain and 284% in Germany. A magical world indeed where over 1,600 companies share just one address, 5, rue Guillaume, but then the companies may amount to little more than a brass plate.
Ikea provides an example of the conjuring tricks that PwC and Luxembourg perform. Inter Ikea, based in the Netherlands Antilles, lent up to €6bn to Inter Ikea Finance in Luxembourg. This subsidiary then transferred the money to Ikea's branch in Switzerland. The Swiss branch lent the money to Ikea group companies elsewhere. Interest received from the group companies went back to the Swiss branch where it was taxed at very low rates. The money that passed through Luxembourg was taxed at 0.03% for each 1bn euro sent on to Switzerland and once the fund exceeded 6bn euro the tax would fall to 0.016%, all ‘in compliance with current tax legislation', announced a Luxembourg tax official.
Dyson is another company that perfected a sleight of hand to profitable effect by conjuring up different identities in Malta, the Isle of Man and Luxembourg. £300m worth of loans would be pumped from abroad to Dyson James Limited in Britain. Money paid on the loans would go to Dyson's Luxembourg entity Blue Blade. As costs these payments would be tax deductible. Blue Blade paid under 1% corporation tax in Luxembourg; it could demonstrate that it had borrowed money from the Isle of Man subsidiary and this would be registered as a cost for tax deduction purposes, but the money from the Isle of Man was interest free, there was no cost! Magic it is when profits resurface as costs, and the profits just got bigger.
The pervasiveness of corporate tax avoidance is demonstrated by the Financial Times and The Guardian, who both call for a clamp down. The Financial Times is owned by the Pearson Group plc which has employed complex tax avoidance structures in Luxembourg. The Guardian Media Group refinanced an offshore joint venture in trade publishing, Emap, with the private equity firm Apax ‘via a purchase of external mezzanine debt' conducted through two new Luxembourg companies. Very fancy!
The Napoleon of crime
‘Princes should devolve all matters of responsibility upon others, take upon themselves only those of grace'. Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince.
The European Commission is now charged with negotiating measures to stop tax avoidance. However, the European Commission president is Jean-Claude Juncker, prime minister of Luxembourg between 1995 and 2013, when Luxembourg became the top European tax haven. One commentator remarked that putting Juncker in charge of efforts to combat tax avoidance was like putting Dracula in charge of a blood bank. Juncker says that they did not design Luxembourg's tax regime and that the tax authorities acted independently. This did not convince Britain's Secretary of Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith who said it was time for European commissioners to show they had ‘no fear of investigating their own'. Duncan Smith was echoed by Labour shadow European spokesperson Pat McFadden, ‘if more comes out on this then really serious questions will have to be asked about their [Juncker's] position'. Following a motion proposed by, among others, Britain's Ukip and France's National Front, the European parliament is to debate whether Juncker should resign as the European Commission president. Meanwhile, the mastermind behind the entire contrivance, the Napoleon of crime, sits untouched behind any one of the desks in PwC's 776 offices in 157 countries.
The Conservative Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party are all in thrall to PwC. Since 2010 PwC staff held positions in the offices of Labour's Shadow ministers for international development, business and education. A senior PwC associate is currently on a six month posting worth £75,000 to Shadow Education Secretary Tristram Hunt. Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna received research support worth £60,000 from PwC in 2013-14 to help shape tax, welfare and business policy. A Labour Party spokesperson said that accountancy firms ‘do not influence opposition policy decisions'. What on earth are they doing then? Rachel Reeves, Labour's Shadow Work and Pensions' secretary, is getting help from a PwC consultant from October to January for £41,000. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls received almost £200,000 from PwC and the rest of the Shadow Treasury team got over £170,000 of support. Labour has also received over £250,000 for staff costs from KPMG.
The Labour Party is the direct beneficiary of PwC and its tax avoidance schemes, it invites PwC to advise and direct its would-be ministers. We may have the vote but who runs this country? The City runs it.
For the city's 66 million annual tourists there are parts of Orlando that you can't help but see: the Mickey Mouse-shaped street lamps; the city's enormous ferris wheel and billboard after billboard hawking the new Harry Potter attraction at Universal Orlando.
But there's another Orlando that, like Disney World's utilidors, you won't see in the trip from the airport to the theme park, unless you go looking for it – an Orlando with more Spanish moss than palm trees, one with dozens of little lakes, and train stations to ferry people to work rather than the Magic Kingdom.
Almost 48% of companies here are minority-owned and nearly 30% of the population is Latino. In Osceola County – just south of Orlando, where housing is somewhat less expensive – 48% of firms are minority-owned and 49.7% of the population is Latino.
That number is growing, in part spurred by a recent influx to Florida of Puerto Ricans fleeing the effects of the financial crisis on the island. The Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration regional office estimates that 1,000 Puerto Rican families relocate to Florida every month; as a result, the state is poised, for the first time, to edge New York out as the state with the most Puerto Ricans.
And though many Puerto Rican voters in Florida are focused on the financial crisis on the island, that doesn't mean that they're unconcerned with the rhetoric around immigration and “Mexicans”, as epitomized by statements made by people like Donald Trump. Like many Latinos in the US, they know full well that most white Americans who run around insulting “Mexicans” are using it as a substitute for “Latino”.

Real estate broker Orlando Rodríguez, 41, spoke in Spanish, concerned that their English wasn't good enough and their accent too thick. “When I'm speaking to an American, if I don't speak properly sometimes they get annoyed,” they explained. “That's what I've mostly come across,” they said, in terms of overt, individualized racism.
“Americans don't see us as US citizens; Americans see all Latinos as Mexicans. Just like we think all Asians are Chinese – they could be Korean, Japanese, Indonesian but we see them and think ‘they're all Chinese'. Lots of Americans see [Latinos] as all the same.”
And though this issues that individual groups of Latinos might be different – from Cuba policy to the financial crisis on Puerto Rico, and from immigration enforcement to raising the minimum wage – they all eventually find themselves bound together by their daily experiences. They aren't “all the same”; yet they too often all get treated with the same basic disrespect.
Jose Martinez, 35, like many Puerto Ricans, has very fair skin. “I look ‘American', from the States,” they explained. “[But] when I start talking in English, I have an accent.” They were at a cousin's wedding on Cape Cod a few years ago, waiting to play pool and, “when I came to the table, I changed the rules to the Puerto Rican way and the guys were cool with it, but the bouncer, [he heard] me, threw me out.”
That was only their first time: “When I worked with Fema [after Hurricane Sandy, inspecting housing damaged by the storm], when I went down to Queens, stayed the night and [the residents] looked at me normal until I started speaking and then they knew I was Puerto Rican.”
“But I was working for the federal government, so they were respecting me because I was doing the inspections. If not, you know what happens.”
Julie Torres, 32, thinks that race plays a role in the way many white Americans view not just Puerto Ricans or just Latinos, but the whole relationship between the US government and Puerto Rico. “There is a history of racialization that I think that does impact how we view Puerto Rico as kind of this ‘other', this other entity, this other culture, this other people, that could come into play,” the doctoral student said. “I mean, people think ‘American', [they think] white America.”

But unlike the 11 million undocumented immigrants Donald Trump has promised to deport in their first two years in office, Puerto Ricans are US citizens, and eligible to vote, whether they live in Puerto Rico or on the mainland.
In a swing state like Florida (where George W Bush's official margin of victory in 2000 was just 537 votes) an influx of thousands of Puerto Rican voters – who lean Democratic – could definitely swing Florida's 29 electoral college votes in November.
About 400,000 of people of Puerto Rican extraction now live in Orlando; many of the most recent arrivals speak limited English, which prevents them from obtaining comparative jobs in the fields they left behind on “the island” but, with taxes and the cost of living going up and jobs disappearing there as a result of the ongoing financial crisis, they see few alternatives to building a new life on the mainland.
Martinez is one of those recent arrivals: apologetic about their accented but near-perfect English, they explained that they moved to Orlando in mid-April. Though they were a real estate broker on the island, their license didn't transfer, so he's working in construction temporarily. “I had a good job down there,” they said over traditional Puerto Rican food at Lechonera el Jibarito #2, “but when I was seeing what was going on, I decided, I'm going to jump the hoop and see what happens.”

Rodríguez and elementary school teacher Tania Irizarry, 39, moved to Orlando 10 months ago with their five-year-old son for similar reasons – though the financial crisis was, for them, just the final frustration with a political system rigged against most of the residents.
“The ordinary people have to bear the brunt of the situation,” Rodríguez said. “They have to put up with bad health and education services and with crime. Job prospects aren't good. Crime levels are through the roof.”
But, “it doesn't matter [to the politicians] what state our education or health services are in,” they added. “They'll fall over themselves trying to win the election and run the colony because there's money in it that they're going to earn; they'll share it out amongst themselves and they'll be fine. Everyone else can go to hell.”
Irizarry, who was able to transfer their teacher's license from the island and now works as an assistant teacher, says that the educational system and the lack of access to information holds back many of the people on the island. “Everything has to do with the political system and with colonialism, because you're only taught one part: the part that's in the interest of whoever wants to keep control of the country,” they said in Spanish, though they are fully fluent in English.
Torres, who was born in the Bronx of Puerto Rican extraction, moved to the city from Illinois as part of their doctoral research into Puerto Rican migration patterns.
Like Irizarry, they see the echoes of American colonialism in both the economic crisis and the lack of access to services – like education – that most Americans all but consider their birthright. “I think that we do need to recognize just how the deeply rooted history of colonialism on the island has impacted Puerto Rico and the economy and all these different facets,” they said.
Esteban Garcés, 35, doesn't want ignorance to be a problem for the Puerto Ricans moving to central Florida. Born in Washington, DC to a Bolivian immigrant, they are also a recent transplant to Orlando, where they work as an organizer with Mi Familia Vota, helping educate Latinos about their rights and getting them to the polls. But after stints in DC and Boston, Massachusetts, where immigration issues are paramount, they say that large Puerto Rican population in and around Orlando isn't as focused on immigration: like Rodríguez, Irizarry and Martinez, they're very focused on what Congress is or is not doing to end the financial crisis on the island.

They say they tell the people with whom they interact: “If we have folks from Puerto Rico voting here, they can affect what happens on the island from here to central Florida. Congress listens to voters here.”
They added: “You can elect who goes to Congress and that person has a vote in Congress here and you can vote for the president here. And that's not the case in Puerto Rico.”
The sheer volume of Puerto Ricans moving to central Florida could change more than just that – especially for the presidential candidates seeking to win in the state. “The Puerto Rican vote is really, if you ask me, going to determine who the next president is,” Garcés said.
“Why? Because the Latino vote here in central Florida is a swing vote in a swing region of central Florida. And this swing region of central Florida is going to determine how Florida votes. Florida is going to determine who the next president is.”

WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security has put off plans to impose further bans on laptop computers and other electronic devices in airline carry-on baggage for flights to the U.S. from Europe, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said Wednesday.
Instead the U.S. will require airlines and overseas airports to step up their procedures for screening passengers and securing airplanes.
"We are not standing on the sidelines while fanatics hatch new plots. The US government is focused on deterring, detecting, and disrupting these threats," Kelly said.
Passengers will be allowed to carry electronic devices larger than a cell phone onto U.S.-bound flight if they board an airline that complies with new U.S.-imposed security directives calling for more extensive passenger screening, increased use of bomb-sniffing dogs, and improved security measures.
"We could ban the devices outright," a Homeland Security official said, "But we have chosen measures that address the risk without removing the devices from airplanes."
The new requirements, to be implemented in phases, will be imposed at more than 280 airports in 105 countries, affecting 180 airlines that offer direct flights to the US. An average of about 2,000 such flights come here every day, carrying a total of roughly 325,000 passengers.

Domestic flights within the U.S. will not be affected, the officials said, because security measures have been enhanced in recent months, offering a better look at the contents of carry-on baggage in general and personal electronic devices in particular.
In March, the U.S. ordered airlines operating from ten Middle Eastern and African airports to prevent passengers from carrying electronic devices on board that are larger than a cell phone, on direct flights to the United States. The directive said the devices must be stored in a passenger's checked baggage.
Homeland Security officials said the restrictions in those countries will be lifted as the affected airlines comply with the new security directives.
But if any airlines fail to comply with the new directives, the officials said, the US could levy fines, limit the carrier's ability to fly to the U.S., or completely ban electronic devices from an airline's inbound planes in both carry-on and checked baggage.
"Our enemies are constantly working to find new methods for disguising explosives, recruiting insiders, and hijacking aircraft," Kelly said. "We cannot play international whack-a-mile with each new threat. Instead we must put new measures in place across the board."
Passenger check-in procedures will vary among airports and airlines, depending on how much they need to do to meet the new requirements. Some are substantially in compliance already.
Late last year, U.S. officials say, the U.S. picked up intelligence suggesting that a terrorist group had developed the ability to conceal explosives in working laptop computers. American officials concluded that the resulting devices could successfully pass through conventional airport screening equipment.
Airlines and European airports have said extending the electronics ban would cause significant disruption and that forcing passengers to put laptop computers into their checked baggage could pose a fire hazard from the concentration of so many lithium-ion batteries in airplane cargo compartments.
A global airline industry group said earlier this month that the limited ban already in place appears to have reduced travel on the affected routes.
While worldwide air travel was up in March, it fell by about three percent from what it was a year before on routes to the U.S. flown by Middle Eastern airlines, according to the International Air Transport Association.
Alexandre de Juniac, the airline group's director general and CEO, said extending the ban to include flights from Europe would produce "a $1.4 billion hit on productivity," because passengers would not be able to use laptop computers to work in the air.
We've already leaked the first seven minutes of the Survivor: Game Changers premiere (which premieres March 8 on CBS), and now it's time for something that will excite hardcore fans almost as much.
Since there is so much action on the beach to get to on Survivor these days, the opening credits now amount to just a few seconds. But the expanded, old-school credits that show all the contestants in all of their slow-motion glory do in fact exist, and they exist right here.
Once again, we've got the exclusive full Survivor: Game Changers opening credits that you won't see on TV, and they are glorious. Watch Sandra point to the sky, Malcolm tosses a ring, Ozzy dives off a boat (of course), Michaela digs for treasure (or, you know, puzzle pieces), and Tai be about a half-second away from getting bashed in the face with a falling crate.

LEIGH SALES, PRESENTER: While Labor deals with its rift with the Greens, the Coalition's trying to manage a rift of its own over foreign investment.
High-profile Senator Barnaby Joyce and other National Party colleagues are furious about plans to sell Cubbie Station in Queensland to a Chinese company and they've been pretty vocal publicly.
But that goes against Coalition policy, which firmly backs foreign investment in Australia.
The Opposition Leader has reiterated their support for the policy, but it's the Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey who's had to pull their National Party colleagues into line, accusing them of "freelancing" with views that don't represent the Coalition's position.
Earlier today, Senator Joyce joined me from Tamworth.
Senator Joyce, are you freelancing with your views on the sale of Cubbie Station rather than speaking for the Coalition?
BARNABY JOYCE, NATIONALS SENATE LEADER: I think it's very important that we understand at this point in time, Leigh, that there's been no transparency in this deal. On a Friday night, basically, Mr Swan put out a decision for which he's given really no explanation about. Even between now and then the closest we've got, Leigh, to an explanation is their Twitter account. Now, we are talking about the largest property in Australia in value. The largest irrigation property in Australia. The largest water licence in Australia in an area that is so sensitive in the Murray-Darling Basin. We're talking about an excess of 10 per cent of our nation's cotton crop.
LEIGH SALES: I'll ask you that question again. Are you freelancing with your views on the sale of Cubbie Station and not speaking for the Coalition?
BARNABY JOYCE: No, I'm not, and I'll answer it directly too. We're talking about the largest water licence, Leigh, and I am the Shadow Minister for Water. We're talking about a very important issue in regional development and this is an area that's absolutely epitomises regional development, Dirranbandi and what we can do for it. We're talking about an issue in Queensland - and I'm senator for Queensland - and we're talking about an issue that is in my backyard, so, no, I'm not.
LEIGH SALES: But both Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey have said that they support the decisions of the Foreign Investment Review Board, so that puts your stated views here at odds with them.
BARNABY JOYCE: Well I'd like to see exactly more details on what the discussions are in the Foreign Investment Review Board because they're confidential papers. Now, the only person who's seen them is Mr Swan and Mr Swan hasn't given Australia any confidence whatsoever in regards to their decision. In fact it's so pathetic the closest we can get to Mr Swan is their Twitter account.
LEIGH SALES: Do you accept that your views are at odds with Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey?
BARNABY JOYCE: I accept that everybody wants something in the national interest. Everybody has said that's in the national interest, and it's quite obvious that Mr Swan has given us no confidence whatsoever that their diligence over this would show that it's in the national interest.
LEIGH SALES: I think we're conducting a different interview here because I'm asking what's going on with Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey and you're talking about Mr Swan. Do you accept Mr Hockey's assertion that frontbenchers like you and Warren Truss have an obligation to support Coalition policy which is pro-foreign investment?
BARNABY JOYCE: Well we haven't been back to Parliament since this decision was made, as you know, Leigh; there's been no cabinet meeting at this point in time and, you know, I think in light of what Mr Swan did and the fact that they put the decision out to sell Australia's largest property, that could actually be broken up.
LEIGH SALES: Have you spoken to Mr Abbott or Mr Hockey in the past 24 hours about this?
BARNABY JOYCE: Yes.
LEIGH SALES: And what was said?
BARNABY JOYCE: That's none of your business.
LEIGH SALES: You don't think that the viewers of this program, the people who vote for you, would like to know what was discussed?
BARNABY JOYCE: No, well because that is a private discussion between myself and somebody else and I'm not - I would not disclose their confidence, and to be honest, people like to have private conversations kept private.
LEIGH SALES: How far are you prepared to go in your opposition to this? Are you prepared to lose your shadow cabinet spot?
BARNABY JOYCE: Leigh, all that's basically a question for the future. I'd never - what I know, Leigh, is that people have an expectation that decisions that are crucial to their nation are properly debated and properly ventilated and that's - you can't look at someone in the face when they ask you a straight question about what's exactly involved with this process say, "Well, you know, I'm going to say nothing because it'll protect my personal position."
LEIGH SALES: Sure, but are you prepared to lose that personal position over it?
BARNABY JOYCE: Leigh, this is - once more, we're taking the debate on an issue about Barnaby Joyce. I couldn't give a toss about my own personal position. This is about the sale of our nation's biggest property, the biggest water licence, and also with the Murray-Darling Basin plan at foot, what on Earth do we do? If Cubbie Station doesn't deliver any water back to the environment for environmental purposes, where will that water come from, Leigh?
LEIGH SALES: What do you fear will happen if Cubbie Station is owned by foreigners rather than Australians?
BARNABY JOYCE: Well, I've got no problems with foreign investment, and in fact we've got lots of other properties in our district, Leigh, which are owned by the Chinese, owned by other people and good luck to them. I've fully supported it and you've never heard boo about me over this. The issue with this one, Leigh, it is the biggest property. It has a large stake in a crucial market, in our second biggest export market after wheat, I think, cotton. It's more than 10 per cent of that market. It is the crucial player, the biggest player in our water market, the biggest player in our water market. It is the biggest representation in value of an agricultural asset in our nation. This is exceptional.
LEIGH SALES: But what do you think the Chinese owners would do that isn't in Australia's national interest?
BARNABY JOYCE: Well, Leigh, the question is - they've got conditions on it already, so they've already - they've obviously got concerns already. And so if they've got conditions which shows they've got concerns, then it's not something - a parochial point of view of mine.
LEIGH SALES: But what you're saying is that you don't trust the Chinese owners to run Cubbie Station. Why?
BARNABY JOYCE: Well it's not a case of trusting them or not, it's a case of proper investigation and diligence to explore that fact and we haven't had it. It is the largest farm, Leigh, and where is the proper diligence? I mean, I and you and everybody else deserves a better process of diligence than having to talk to Mr Swan over Twitter to try and find out exactly what's going on with this.
LEIGH SALES: But your Coalition colleagues aren't bothered by this. They have confidence in the Foreign Investment Review Board.
BARNABY JOYCE: Well, Leigh, I have got to, because it's in my backyard, probably have a real focus on this and that's because it is directly in my area. I mean, we're all - we're completely aware of this property. And I don't think that if you even asked Mr Swan to drive to this property he'd be able to find it without a guide. But it's more important than a decision that you just bundle out on a Friday night. Why didn't we have a 90-day review period, as they could have brought in, Leigh? Why didn't they do that? Why are they trying to hide from us exactly what's involved with this?
LEIGH SALES: Barnaby Joyce, thanks for talking with us.
Film auteur Ram Gopal Verma has decided to mansplain to us why women should be allowed to make sexual and career choices. Since their last few long films have failed miserably, he's now decided to branch into the short film category with a “feminist" short. Meri Beti Sunny Leone Banna Chaahti Hai is a 11 minute, 29-second film which will make the most liberal and feminist of us cringe. I can pretty much lay a bet that it would make Sunny Leone cringe. And smart at the fact that Verma is using their name for publicity. Because there's no reason other than the title that you'd watch this film for.
The short starts with a battery of quotes, because Verma is nothing if not erudite. All the quotes though are incorrect and have never been uttered or penned by the people they are attributed to. There's “to take away a person's freedom of choice even if it's a perceived wrong one, is nothing but suppression" attributed to George Washington, who never said these words. Ever. I checked. Multiple sources. This is followed by, “to force another person to live the way what you think is right, is against the democratic right of freedom of choice" attributed to Ayn Rand, who may have written a whole bunch of poppycock which is swallowed up whole by teenagers. But they never wrote this. There's a quote attributed to the “Hindu" Upanishads (as opposed to the Islamic ones, which we also read now and then) on sex and women, which I have no way of verifying, but I'm guessing it's as accurate as the first two quotes.
The film is almost Hitchockian in its aim. It's shot in one room with three people. It could be Hitchcock's Rope or Roman Polanski's Carnage. But sadly, it isn't.
We see a man and their wife speaking to their daughter who seems to be in their early 20's. They are from a middle-class milieu as explained when the daughter comments on their father's job as an assistant manager in a government office. While the parents are dressed simply, the daughter is togged out in jeans and boots and has had their hair straightened. All possible. Other than the conversation. Which, if people are having with their families, my strong advice would be to desist from doing so.
The film stars Naina Ganguly, Makarand Deshpande and Divya Jagdale—and begins with the father (Deshpande) asking their daughter (Ganguly) what they mean by saying that they want to be Sunny Leone. The wife (Jagdale) is standing behind him, looking perplexed, like most parents or thinking people would be if told that someone educated and seemingly able to land a job in the non-sex industry wanted to be a porn star. The daughter, who for some reason is sitting in the same pose as Amitabh Bachchan's in the Sarkar poster, then proceeds to spend the next nine minutes telling their parents why their choosing to be a porn star is a sign of female emancipation. Which would well make sense, if the arguments offered made sense.
But much like Ram Gopal Verma's recent films, the arguments also fall flat on their face.
The arguments posed by the daughter are that men like their father have for generations suppressed women and made us unsure of our sexuality (!) and have told us to save our “sexuality" for our husband. So that our husbands can extract their “entertainment" from us. And when they get bored, they will make us become child-bearing machines and look after children. A crudely put explanation of marriage being a patriarchal institution, but there's some semblance of a point there. Although what it has to do with them being a porn star–and especially since Sunny Leone is a married woman–beats me.
Also, the irony that porn itself is steeped in patriarchy and misogyny, seems to have eluded Verma while they were doing their deep research for this film. It is only now that the porn industry has started making “women-friendly" porn, which doesn't meet the absurd standards of sexual acts set by earlier decades. Just the fact that for the longest time porn stars were not allowed to use condoms even if this meant that female porn stars were exposed to STDs and had to be on contraception to not get pregnant, should underline how female-unfriendly the porn industry has been. This is also an industry where the shelf life of female stars lasts a couple of years at best, a couple of months at worst—unlike male stars. There are umpteen cases of rape on set, as exposed recently with the James Deen case. Verma should really watch some documentaries on the porn industry in India and abroad to correct their facts about this industry being a feminist beacon of hope.
But that's just tish tosh for someone like Verma, who seems to think that being a porn star is the ultimate feminist move.
The daughter then says that Leone gets lakhs of rupees for just a 10-minute appearance, which is more than their father will earn in five years. So, easy money is the other reason. I'm telling you, it only gets better.
Freedom of choice is the next. Which I agree with. Women are free to choose to do what we want. Much like our parents are free to tell us if we're being imbeciles. As they do, with this woman.
They also say that a woman's body is their property and they can do with it what they want. Again, an accurate statement and thought.
The other reason, when asked by their father who will marry them if they become a porn star, is that they don't want to get married, they want to enjoy their life and if they do marry she'll marry someone like Leone's husband Daniel Weber, who understands them Even Weber must be surprised that he's being held up as the ideal husband.
The other argument is that a woman's value lies in only their beauty and sex appeal, so they should make the most of these. Good way to reduce women to just looks, Mr Verma. Ten on 10 for just this argument. And for actually buying into and underlining the objectification of women as sex objects in the porn industry.
As far as self-goals go, this is right up there.
Just when you think your brain will implode, the film ends, that too with another quote, this time attributed to Verma himself. Thankfully. It is—I strongly believe women empowerment should have no discrimination. Them power should be their choice.
It's good to keep in mind that on International Women's Day, 8 March 2017, Verma had tweeted—I wish all the women in the world give men as much happiness as Sunny Leone does. Why? Who knows. Leone posted a video responding to Verma saying, “change only happens when we speak in one voice. So choose your words wisely". And therein lies the problem with Verma. They needed to choose the words their female feminist protagonist spoke a little wisely, as well.
If the aim was to be provocative with this film, Verma has managed to do so. If it was to make an intellectual point about freedom of choice, maybe he's come near that. But to posit joining the porn industry as a feminist move and not be able to back that up with a stable argument, other than women have only their looks and sexual appeal to stand on and easy money being attractive is not only trite but an insult to feminism. And injurious to people like us who watch these videos.
My sincere advice to Mr Verma is to not tweet, not make short films, not make long films—and definitely not be the feminist torchbearer he's hoping to be. Really, we have it tough enough as women, without having to be reduced to sex objects by yet another man.
Also, quit making up quotes. Google is your friend. Use it accurately.
If you must watch the film, you can do so here. You have been warned.
This complaint is not just about simple violations of department policy, which obviously cover this officer's very outspoken and offensive remarks to me that day.
We are talking about violations of my Constitutional right to take photographs in public, violations of DPD General Orders 331 regarding those rights, and the fact that any officer with Mr. Funches history – insubordination, disrespect to DPD civilian personnel, lying about off-duty work and – oh my – assaulting their wife – should not even be on the force dealing with the public.
When I filed my complaints in April against several officers in regards to the Santa Fe Trail incident, the issue was kicked back down to Central, where it languished since Chief Tittle was in Austin for several months on department business. It eventually was kick backed to Public Integrity, where it sat again for several months, and only last week was I interviewed by the IA team on this issue. That is nearly nine months since the initial complaint was filed.
How long do you think this complaint will sit before someone bothers looking at it?
The issues in this complaint are DEPARTMENTAL issues: Despite participating in the “Right to Photograph and Record in Public” last October 2014, and the issue of the very-watered down policy this summer, the Department has not come to grips with the problem of officers interfering with the public taking their photographs on public streets.
This is not something that will be smoothed over by a cup of coffee and a meeting with the Central Division Chief. Officer Funches is a walking time-bomb who apparently does not care about policy decisions if they do not suit him.
When I filed my original complaint, I noted that I was in fear of being arrested by Officer Funches. Only after seeing their history online, did I realize – Damn, that guy would have no problem beating the crap out of me, all the while smiling.
AGAWAM -- A family in Agawam, Massachusetts, reported to local police that a drone was seen hovering outside their 19-year-old daughter's window early Wednesday morning, according to Western Mass News.
Ali DiCioccio, 19, was allegedly lying in bed in their second story room, when they heard a humming noise and felt a vibration. Looking out the window, they saw what they thought was a drone hovering in the air outside.
The event reportedly took place at approximately 3 a.m. on Wednesday morning.
DiCioccio allegedly rushed to the window and was able to capture 9 seconds of the drone on the camera on their cell phone before the device took off.
Ali's mother Kristin DiCioccio said that the family found the experience "creepy" and expressed concern over why the drone was there.
"It's our property, it's a violation of our space," DiCioccio said, according to Western Mass News.
Agawam Police Lt. Jennifer Blanchette said that while the event was "disturbing," it's technically not illegal to fly a drone over someone's property, unless it lands.

Senegalese health workers and activists are demanding women be allowed access to medically safe abortions in certain cases, such as rape or under-age pregnancies. "Secret" abortions are now one of the leading causes of maternal death in Senegal and forced pregnancies have led to an increase in infanticide.
The World Health Organization says an estimated one in 10 pregnant women who die in Senegal are believed to perish due to complications from illegal or unsafe abortions.
Sixty percent of illegal abortions in Senegal are done on women between 19 and 25 years old. Experts here say many women and girls, who may be unmarried or have been raped, feel they have no other solution.
Dr. Amy Ndao Fall, the president of Senegal's Association of Female Doctors, says secret abortions are getting more common.
“The acts are becoming more and more serious. Before you had to look for someone to perform an abortion, but now with the internet, women look for information and try to do it themselves. So as doctors we are quite concerned," said Fall.
Abortion has been illegal in Senegal since before the country became independent from France. An exception was added to the law in 1967 that allows for a medical abortion to be performed if the life of the mother is in imminent danger.
But even then, three different doctors have to testify in court on behalf of the woman before the abortion can be performed. Experts say it is time consuming and often too expensive for women.
“Laws are meant to protect citizens. Laws are meant to save the life of mothers, to preserve women's physical health, their mental health," said Fatou Kine Camara, president of the Senegalese Lawyers Association. "But is this the case with the abortion law? No. In fact, it's the opposite. In Senegal, it's much too restrictive."
Camara said women in Senegal who perform self-abortions can face up to 10 years in prison and up to $200 in fines. Doctors found to be aiding women with illegal abortions can have their licenses suspended or revoked, and face similar prison sentences and fines.
Camara added that restrictive abortion laws have also led to an increase in infanticide, particularly among the poor, as mothers who give birth to an unwanted child have few other options in Senegal.
Local media often report on babies being dumped in wells or drowned.
Religious beliefs in Senegal, where 92 percent of the country is Muslim, are a key barrier to making abortion more legal. While Islam allows for the use of pregnancy prevention measures, it forbids the termination of a fetus.
Health workers are now pushing for better access to emergency contraception, such as the morning after pill, which is allowed in certain cases, such as rape, under Islamic law.
“Today, at the level of the work I do in my pharmacy, regarding the reality I see in the local neighborhoods, regarding the reality of the lack of discussion of safe sex within families, regarding the needs of young people, we think that emergency contraception could have a real impact on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies,” said Mamadou Sow, a pharmacist in Dakar.
According to the International Consortium for Emergency Contraception, only 0.2 percent of women in Senegal say they have ever used emergency contraception. Just eight percent of women of reproductive age use a modern form of contraception.
Senegal's Ministry of Health says it supports family planning activities and is working to educate people about the dangers of secret abortions. It is now looking into the possibility of allowing for safe, medical abortions under certain circumstances, but says no law is on the table.
While games as a service doesn't have the best of reputations, contributing to countless debates over DLC, season passes and, most recently, loot boxes, a recent study reveals that a lot of us have eagerly bought into the model, and as a result, the value of the industry has tripled.
Monetisation services company Digital River recently published a report titled ‘Defend Your Kingdom: What Game Publishers Need to Know About Monetization & Fraud' which found that even premium games—as in not free-to-play—benefited significantly from DLC and microtransactions.
“In 2016, a quarter of all digital revenue from PC games with an upfront cost came from additional content,” the report reads. Though it also notes that consumers now expect more for less, and the model has been a reaction to that.
"Consumers are less willing to pay $60 for a boxed game and instead choose titles with a steady stream of new content," the report said. "Publishers seek to meet these expectations and have adopted a 'games as a service' model, releasing fewer titles over time while keeping players engaged longer with regular updates and add-ons."
As players are turned into long-term customers, buying loot crates and expansions instead of splashing out on the occasional expensive game, revenue per user is expected to grow twice as fast as the rest of the market, explains the report.

The Campaign Legal Center is urging Facebook to release the content of political ads purchased by Russian nationals and displayed on Facebook, most notably during the 2016 presidential campaign cycle.
CNBC obtained an advance copy of a letter sent Tuesday to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg from CLC President Trevor Potter. The nonprofit watchdog group accuses Facebook of having been "used as an accomplice in a foreign government's effort to undermine democratic self governance in the United States."
The letter urges Zuckerberg to release the ads and "allow the country to better understand the nature and extent of foreign interference with our democracy."
Facebook recently announced that more than 3,000 ads were purchased by approximately 470 fake users between 2015 and May of this year. The company has so far refused to release the content of the ads, which it said, "appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum — touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights."
Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.
The letter marks the latest sign of growing pressure Facbeook faces from Washington, where members of Congress are demanding more information into how the Russian bots managed to purchase the ads and what Facebook will do in the future to prevent foreign influence campaigns.
One congressional critic is the ranking member of the powerful Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who recently said they believe the Facebook announcement was merely "the tip of the iceberg." Speaking at a security conference, Warner also signaled that they expect more transparency from companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google about who is purchasing ads.
The Campaign Legal Center is a nonprofit watchdog group in Washington, D.C., that monitors adherence to campaign finance laws and disclosure requirements. It recently hired Walter Shaub, a former director of the Office of Government Ethics who resigned in July after repeatedly clashing with the Trump administration.
Read the entire letter, below.
One of the most memorable scenes from James Szalapski's extraordinary “Heartworn Highways” is at the end of the country/folk documentary Christmas Day song-along. Fueled by cigarettes and wine Steve Young, Rodney Crowell, Steve Earle, Jim McGuire and others are shown having a raucous guitar pull at Guy and Susanna Clark's Nashville home. Near the end Rodney Crowell leads the gathered in beautifully delivered “Silent Night.” Crowell renders a tone of beauty that brings a hush to this seasoned (and buzzed) band of new outlaws.
Now a veteran of the country/Americana field he's hardly coasting. Crowell along with their old Hot Band collaborator, Emmylou Harris won a Best Americana Album Grammy for last year's “Old Yellow Moon.” They also performed at an Everly Brothers tribute will in LA to pick up the prize. They most recently held court a few well-received sets at South By Southwest.
One track on Crowell's upcoming album, Tarpaper Sky (April 15) offers a gumbo-flavored track, “Fever on the Bayou.”
The song has been decades in the making. It began as a collaboration between Will Jennings. But, says Crowell “Due to our inability to come up with a suitable last verse, the song lay dormant for twenty-plus years. An off-chance conversation with a friend of mine in which the word Franglais—an improper synthesis of the French and English languages as I understood it—gave me the idea that the last verse should echo the Cajun French I'd heard working on construction crews along the Texas-Lousiana border. Once I had that last verse the recording was a snap.”
Check the lyric video for “Fever on the Bayou” below. Tarpaper Sky will be out April 15 via New West. Pre-order here.
I've been blogging about testing and taking apart camera equipment for almost a decade. Lensrentals.com has many thousand lenses these days, and they all get used frequently. When you have lots of lenses and they get used frequently, stuff gets inside them.
Usually the stuff that gets inside is dust. Our repair techs open up and clean dust out of more than 100 lenses a week. Not because the dust matters a bit in a photograph; it doesn't. But because people still seem to think it does. People also, for reasons I can't understand, seem to think that weather sealed lenses are less likely to get dust in them than non-weather sealed lenses. I'm not sure why they think this, but they do.
Sometimes the stuff that gets inside them is interesting and we get to blog about it. We found a spider, complete with web, inside a lens once and yesterday we got to add a new item to our ‘found inside lenses' collection; a nice, fat, fly. And not just a fly inside a lens, but one way down deep inside a weather sealed lens. So deep that it took 4 hours of work to get it out.
The lens in question was a Canon 24-105mm f/4 IS that returned from rental looking quite normal with the renter taking equally normal photos.
Nothing unusual looking about this lens on its return.
But a quick look through the glass reveals a fairly significant problem a fly deep inside the lens. Being in the middle of the lens with lots of glass elements on either side, it was much more difficult to photograph than it was to see visually. Darryl finally came up with an arrangement that worked decently.
Canon 5DIII with MP-E 65 5x Macro lens shooting through the 24-105. Angling the light let it bounce around through the glass elements and give us decent lighting.
After a little trial and error, they got some decent images of the fly.
If you just dropped by to see a fly picture, you may go now. But getting the fly out of the lens turned into a 4-hour ordeal for Darryl. The pictures they took along the way do a great job of demonstrating exactly why dust will always find it's way into a lens, so if you'd like to see that process, read on.
Darryl's first thought was that removing the front element would let them used some compressed air to blow the fly out of the lens. We didn't have a lot of hope that would work, but it's quick and easy to do so it was worth a try. Next Darryl took the back off of the lens and took out the rear element, hoping that would work. It got another nice picture of the fly, still a few pieces of glass away from freedom, but otherwise didn't accomplish anything.
Finally, bowing to the inevitable, Darryl did a complete disassembly of the autofocus and mechanical system, leaving the inner optical elements in the helicoid barrels.
The point to be made here is that there are huge openings into the inner lens through the helicoid slots. Obviously anything that gets inside the lens is free to move about to the inner elements. Dust particles, spiders, or in this case a fly, are all going to find their way down inside the lens. And weather sealing isn't ever true sealing. There is no lens made for cameras that doesn't have openings that air, dust, and other things can flow through. In the case of the Canon 24-105mm there's an obvious opening through the rear of the lens.
Rear of the Canon 24-105mm showing anything that wants can get inside the lens around the rear group. A lot of lenses are similar to this one, but every lens ever made has openings.
Let's get back to our fly. Now with the inner barrel removed, Darryl could peak through the helicoid openings and locate the fly between elements.
After a little trial and error, they were able to get some needle-nose forceps through a slot and remove the fly. (It wouldn't blow out; apparently some fly sticky-stuff had it pretty adhered to the lens.)
The element could be cleaned through the slots too, and then the lens was reassembled. Because of the amount of disassembly involved, the lens had to be recentered and optically adjusted. Total repair time to get the fly out was just over 4 hours.
The takeaway message, though, is in the picture you can't see here. We took dozens of images with the lens before taking the fly out. We shot stopped down, we shot at all parts of the zoom range. We focused close, we focused far. And in no image could we find the slightest hint that there was a fly in the lens. And you guys worry about a dust particle or two!

June, 2015
Last Friday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order temporarily suspending the refugee program and the issuance of visas for foreign nationals from seven Muslim-majority nations. The order also put an indefinite hold on all refugees coming from the war-torn country of Syria.
The stated purpose of the policy is to “protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States.” But does the change really make America safer? And what are the other implications for both the church and persecuted Christians from around the globe.
I asked Matthew Soerens, co-author of Seeking Refuge: On the Shores of the Global Refugee Crisis (Moody, 2016) and the U.S. director of church mobilization at World Relief, to discuss how Christians should think about the executive order and issues concerning refugees.
What concerns do you have about the new immigration and refugee policy?
The stated goal of the executive order—to protect the United States from terrorism—is entirely appropriate. In fact, that's a God-ordained role of government, and we're glad the president takes that responsibility seriously.
However, I do not believe that the policy changes mandated by the executive order will actually make us safer. I understand people's fears, but I think that many of them are based on misinformation.
The effects of these policies will be severely felt by some of the most vulnerable people in our world. Many of these individuals have already faced horrific persecution—torture, bombings, even genocide—and to have their hopes of finding safety and a new start in the United States withdrawn is devastating.
How does this order affect World Relief and other refugee resettlement agencies?
After the last of those who were considered “in transit” arrive today, we have no further arrivals of refugees scheduled. We've had to tell “Good Neighbor Teams”—the small groups from local churches whom we train and then line up to meet as many arriving refugee families as possible—that we do not know when a family will next be arriving, but probably not for at least four months. We are still ministering to families already here—and still need church partners and volunteers to do so—but there will be far fewer opportunities to minister going forward.
More than 65 percent of our refugee arrival cases are family re-unification cases, so in many of these cancelled cases, our staff have had to break the news to family members here that their relatives who'd had plane tickets purchased are no longer coming—in some cases, at least for a few months, in other cases, such as for Syrians, indefinitely. A colleague in Seattle, who themselves came to the United States in 1989 after fleeing religious persecution in Ukraine, had to tell 36 separate families their relatives were not coming. As you can imagine, those are difficult conversations and all the more difficult for those receiving the bad news.
How can we as a nation balance the need for security and compassion?
Our country actually has a remarkable history of both prioritizing the security of American citizens and extending compassion and hospitality to the persecuted and displaced. It became a campaign talking point to say that “we have no idea” who refugees resettled to the United States are, and that we have no ability to vet them, but these are simply untrue.
The reality is that refugees are already subjected to the most thorough vetting of any category of visitor or immigrant to the United States. If a refugee is referred to the U.S. government for possible resettlement—and less than 1 percent of the registered refugees globally ever are—they begin a screening process that usually takes between 18 months and three years to complete. That process is coordinated between the U.S. Departments of State, Homeland Security, and Defense as well as the FBI and National Counterterrorism Center; it includes in-person interviews, biographic and biometric background checks, and a health screening. If there is any doubt of a refugee's identity or even a hint of concern that they could pose a threat to national security, they are not allowed in.
While any system can be improved, this vetting process has been remarkably effective. Since 1980, when the Refugee Act was signed into law, there have been about 3 million refugees admitted into the United States—and not a single one has taken a single American life in a terrorist attack. A Cato Institute analysis calculates the odds of an American being killed by a refugee-turned-terrorist at 1 in 3.64 billion per year. Do those odds really justify a full shutdown on refugee resettlement from all countries—including countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (the top country of origin for refugees last year) or Burma (the top country in 2015), from which extremist Islamist terrorism is not on anyone's mind as a significant threat?
Is it wrong for Christians to want to prioritize their persecuted brothers and sisters over refugees of other religions?
As Christians, we're commanded to love our neighbors—and Jesus's parable of the Good Samaritan makes explicitly clear that we cannot narrowly define our “neighbor” to include only those who share our faith or ethnicity. Each human being—regardless of religion—is made in the image of God, and all lives are worthy of protection. As such, we are grateful to have had the opportunity to welcome carefully screened refugees of various faiths.
That said, I personally am deeply burdened by the plight of persecuted Christians—and the U.S. refugee resettlement program has been a lifeline for persecuted Christians, more of whom have been allowed into the United States in the past decade than those of any other religion.
While I appreciate the president's expressed concern for persecuted Christian religious minorities, the actual implementation of this executive order will quite clearly be harmful for Christians as well as Muslims.
Most obviously, the order cuts the total number of refugees for Fiscal Year 2017 to 50,000. Since more than 32,000 have already come in—about 43 percent of whom have been Christians—this order will limit to less than 18,000 those who could possibly come in for the rest of the year. Even if all of them were persecuted Christians—which I believe would be a mistake—there would still be at least 5,700 fewer persecuted Christians allowed in than last year.
Furthermore, though President Trump has spoken of the plight of Syrian Christians, in particular, several lawyers with whom I have consulted agree that the language of the executive order bars all Syrian refugees—including Christians and other religious minorities. Likewise, Iranian refugees are presently barred from entry, most of which over years have been Christians (in fact, less than 5 percent have been Muslims).
My view is that we should prioritize refugees based on vulnerability, as has been the practice of past administrations. In some cases, an individual's Christian faith makes them or them uniquely vulnerable in a particular context, which is why more than one-third of Iraqi refugees in the past decade and about 70 percent of Burmese refugees have been Christians—far higher in both cases than Christians' share of the population—because they have been uniquely persecuted for their faith.
By explicitly favoring Christians, it feeds into a narrative that the United States does not value the lives of Muslims, which fuels extremist sentiments and could ultimately put Christians and other religious minorities at greater risk. Open Doors USA president David Curry has warned that the new policy “could tragically result in a backlash against Christians in countries plagued by Islamic extremism.”
Finally, if the United States only resettles persecuted Christians, we are closing the door on one of the most remarkable missional opportunities, as those who are not-yet-Christians, including many from entirely unreached people groups, will no longer be allowed into our country, where local churches have the opportunity—in a context with full religious freedom, where all are free to accept or reject the Christian gospel—to interact with them. From an eternal perspective, do we really think Great Commission opportunity is worth sacrificing for a 1 in 3.6 billion chance of being killed by a terrorist attack?
What advice would you give to pastors who want to faithfully discuss this issue with their congregations?
First, lead with Scripture. If this were not a biblical issue, we'd have no business discussing it in church. But refugees are running throughout the pages, and God has many specific instructions to their people about how to treat vulnerable foreigners. LifeWay Research finds that only 12 percent of evangelical Christians say their views on refugee and immigration issues are primarily influenced by their faith. One tool to address that is the “I Was a Stranger” Challenge, a simple 40-day Bible-reading guide that's available either in digital form or as a simple bookmark to stick into one's Bible.
Second, explain the facts. As Ed Stetzer has helpfully observed, facts are our friends. Pastors can help their congregations to find accurate sources for the facts about the security, economic, and demographic dynamics of refugee resettlement.
Finally, whenever possible, I would encourage pastors to provide the space for a refugee testimony—ideally, that of a persecuted brother or sister in Christ or someone who embraced Jesus in the United States after being welcomed by a local church. It is easy to be afraid of huge numbers, but an individual, with their or their own face and testimony, can powerfully melt misconceptions.
My most important encouragement to pastors would be: do not sit this out. At present, LifeWay Research finds that just one in five evangelicals has ever heard a biblical message about refugees or other immigrants. The people whom God has entrusted to your spiritual leadership need a biblical, fact-based view on this topic. If we outsource our discipleship on this topic to talk radio or Facebook, we risk missing out on a divinely orchestrated opportunity both to stand with the persecuted church and also to live out the Great Commission.
Sugar Addiction and the Weekends
Sugar Rest Weekend.
Just a quickie today…
The weekend can be a tough time for folks that are facing issues with sugar.
We are relieved that we can relax and not worry about interacting with others and just eat what we like.
Or we are looking forward to special events, with special treats.
According to our traffic at the site very few people research information about sugar issues on the weekends. They save it till Sunday night or Monday through Thursday when the traffic spikes again.
I certainly understand that even our issues take a break on the weekends.
But I would like to throw out a challenge for you.
This weekend why don't you rest your sugar intake just a little.
Sleep a little extra.
Drink a lot of water and maybe even take a walk.
Don't go into full blown detox mode.
Just be aware that you are resting your sugar for the weekend instead of possibly binging on your favorites.
Write down how you feel.
See if you don't start next week with a little more spring in your step. A little more self esteem in your now peaceful mind.
This journey is all about conscious awareness of our actions and how it affects us overall. Do the “rest your sugar” weekend consciously, substitute some positive behaviors and recorded it all so you can look back on it.
If you're ready to really get started and kick sugar for good check out a free consult with me here:
Free Consult With Mike
I can't offer it for much longer but I really want to get know our clients and this has been a fascinating few weeks learning about how people are interested in getting started on this journey.
We will get you started right…

David Friedman, Donald Trump's soon-to-be ambassador to Israel, is getting a lot of attention Fridays for having said that center-left American Jews who criticize the Israeli government are “far worse” than individuals who “turned in their fellow Jews in the Nazi death camps.” And said attention is fair, because that's an awful thing to say. My goodness! But Friedman is also notable for another reason: He's the bankruptcy lawyer that helped Trump pull off one of their greatest large-scale deadbeat screw jobs.
Here's the story. In 1995, a company called Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts went public on the New York Stock Exchange. Trump was its chairperson and, beginning in 2000, its CEO. The company lost money every year of its existence and went bankrupt in 2004. Its total 1995–2004 losses: $647 million. When it went bankrupt, bondholders had to settle for less than what they were owed. Employees lost their jobs and contractors went unpaid. IPO investors who held on until the end ultimately lost 90 cents for every dollar invested. “Over the same period,” a MarketWatch columnist noted, “investors in competitor Harrah's Entertainment more than doubled their money. Investors in luxury hotel, casino and resort companies like Starwood and MGM earned returns of more than 400%. Even the plain old stock market index more than doubled.”
Someone made money off Trump Hotels, though: Donald Trump. Their contract kept them well-compensated personally even as they burdened the company itself with unsustainable debt. Like their presidential campaign, meanwhile, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts spent big sums of (other people's) money on other Trumpworld properties—at one point estimating in a public filing, for example, that it had paid $470,000 for “Trump Ice”-brand bottled water in one year. Fortune estimates that on the whole, Trump Hotels—and its zombie post-bankruptcy successor, Trump Entertainment Resorts, which itself went bankrupt in 2009—paid Donald Trump a total of $82 million.
Trump's bankruptcy lawyer, throughout all of this, was David Friedman. It was Friedman who filed for the bankruptcies in 2004 and 2009 and negotiated with the creditors to whom Trump Hotels had gotten in too deep. Neither Trump nor Friedman, however, was ever accused of doing anything improper or illegal in relation to Trump Hotels. Running a company into the ground and then getting to keep all of the enormous windfall you reaped while doing so, as we all learned after the 2008 bank crashes, is often just the way things are done. In other words, Friedman did a pretty good job on Trump's behalf. Now, if confirmed, they get a big reward: Becoming the United States' ambassador to one of the world's most explosive geopolitical hot spots despite a total lack of diplomatic experience and a history of making incendiary statements. What could go wrong?

PRESIDENT Donald Trump's decision to extend their onerous travel ban to countries including North Korea has come as a blow to one Pyongyang family, who were set to go on a long-awaited trip to Florida after saving up their wages for nearly forty years.
“We're banned from entering the US?” moaned Hwan Kwoong, upon hearing the news from a newspaper that they had found in the bushes, which must have blown over from South Korea.
“That sucks. I'm going to have to break it to my family. They were really looking forward to going to the US and trying some of that… what do they call it over there? Oh yeah, food”.
The Kwoong family are among at least a dozen North Korean families whose travel plans out of the DPNK were disrupted by Trump's travel ban, with everyone else in the country perfectly happy to stay in ‘the best country in the whole wide world'.
“Travel ban? Why would they need to implement that? No North Korean wants to leave our heaven to go to that rotting corpulent piss-stain of a country,” read a statement from the offices of Kim Jong-un.
“Everything you need is right here in NK. We have sunshine, warm beaches, fantastic landscapes and our very own Disneyland which is way better than the real Disneyland in the bloated, soulless US of A. We welcome your ban! We were about to issue one of our own! Thanks for saving us the trouble!”
Instead of taking their holiday to the US, the Kwoong family have instead decided to volunteer for work that will further improve the splendid land that is North Korea, and will spend the next few days making sure that North Korean bullets fly fast enough to kill their targets.
Within a short space of time NoLimitCoin (NLC2) (http://nolimitcoin.com/) has gone from languishing amongst the deadbeats on YoBit to reaching incredible new heights. So how does a coin worth a mere 10 Satoshis less than a week ago reach highs of 948 Satoshis so quickly?
￼
Not just a ‘pump and dump'
Many will dismiss the NoLimitCoin price surge as just another ‘shitcoin' being pumped. “This happens all the time” they will say, “it will be dead within a week!” The reality is NoLimitCoin is just getting started. Those of us in the know realise how sorely undervalued this coin is and are holding on tight.
Of course, from the outside looking in it would be hard to recognise. But you had better believe that behind the scenes NoLimitCoin is making big noise. Consider what this coin is aiming to do. It's trying to severely disrupt a $4 Billion industry of fantasy sports betting.
Unlike many of the coins that surround it on YoBit, this coin actually has a purpose. People will need it in order to participate in fantasy sports betting on the No Limit Fantasy Sports platform (http://www.nlfantasysports.com/). This means a significant portion of the supply will be locked up in the game in order for it to run. As more games get added to the platform, the coin will be in ever higher demand which will push the price up further. NoLimitCoin has a relatively low circulating supply of 202,615,362. For a coin that will be in high demand in the coming months, its current price of between 1-2 cents has plenty of room to grow.
Big business involved
Now you might think, who would want to play fantasy sports on this platform? Cryptocurrency isn't yet mainstream and that website doesn't look like much (developers are working on revamping the site).
Well rumour has is that FanDuel and DraftKings, the two largest fantasy sports betting platforms in the US working on a merger, have Already attempted to buy NoLimitCoin. Their offer was turned down, but communication between the two parties is ongoing.
When you consider veterans of the eSports industry are working for the NoLimitCoin development team, this news is hardly surprising.
The movement is growing
The NLC2 community is growing at an incredible pace. The Slack group (https://nlc2.slack.com/) is gaining more members everyday as more people are growing aware of the coin via social media. As the coin starts gaining more attention, the price will only rise further.
Expect to hear about this coin in a big way over the next few months.
What they really means is that it was a full fledged game. Not a modification of existing code or something simple. It was a full fledged commercial product. It COULD be sold as a "commercial product". See this is where game companies typically stop a fan project. They typically ignore it until it shows enough promise to actually be complete and could damage profits and/or their brand. I don't disagree with him. AMR2 was pretty good and was complete enough to be dangerous.
Take my comments with a grain of salt. I also agree that Disney and companies like that should retain their copyright because I don't want to see a lot of Micky Mouse knock offs hitting the market. I'd also like my sequels to be sponsored by the vision of the company that owns them. I DO however appreciate mods and total conversion, but within reason.
The "big data" technology landscape is changing really, really fast. One consequence of this is that it's hard to find good training resources since they become outdated so quickly. I wanted to get some baseline comfort with a variety of technologies in the Hadoop ecosystem but found my options for thorough, guided education somewhat lacking. I eventually settled on MapR's free training courses. Each one is like a miniature version of on online course (most require only a few hours of time). They include interactive video content, quizzes, and various labs to complete using the MapR sandbox. There's a fairly wide range of courses and the content is very professional.
Below is a brief synopsis of the courses they offer. They are completely free to try out - just follow the link above, create an account, and register for the course you're interested in. In addition, I put all of the content for the courses I worked through (including labs with example code) in a github repo.
Note that due to the fast-paced rate of change that I alluded to earlier (and MapR's vested interest in staying current) the course catalog will likely evolve over time. It's possible that this post will become outdated fairly quickly, although I'll try to revisit it periodically to make sure the guidance is still relevant. I should also note that are there snippets of content throughout the training that are specific to the MapR platform, however more than 90% of it is platform-agnostic.
This list is not exhaustive. It only includes the courses that I spent time working on. Feel free to visit the landing page for a complete list of courses.
Hadoop Essentials
These are short, introductory courses that present a very high-level overview of the Hadoop ecosystem.
ESS 100 - Introduction to Big Data
ESS 101 - Apache Hadoop Essentials
ESS 102 - MapR Converged Data Platform Essentials
MapReduce
MapReduce is how it all got started, and is still used quite a bit. MapReduce is a programming model for distributing work over very large data sets across a cluster of machines. The name comes from the two principal steps involved in the process - map (filtering, sorting etc.) and reduce (summary operations).
DEV301 - Developing Hadoop Applications
HBase
HBase is an open-source, non-relational, distributed column-store database written in Java. HBase is very widely used as an alternative to relational databases for certain types of applications where scale is an issue.
DEV320 - HBase Data Model and Architecture
DEV325 - HBase Schema Design
DEV330 - Developing HBase Applications: Basics
DEV335 - Developing HBase Applications: Advanced
DEV340 - HBase Bulk Loading, Performance, and Security
Spark
Spark is an open-source cluster-computing framework that runs on Hadoop. I've written about Spark in the past. Suffice to say that it is a very exciting (and very popular) framework.
DEV360 - Spark Essentials
DEV361 - Build and Monitor Spark Applications
DEV362 - Create Data Pipeline Using Spark
Drill
Drill is an open-source framework for querying semi-structured and unstructured data at scale using SQL-like syntax. I haven't seen a lot of interest in this outside of the MapR distribution but it's a mature technology that has a lot of potential.
DA410 - Drill Essentials
DA415 - Drill Architecture
Hive
Hive is a data warehousing infrastructure built on top of Hadoop that provides the capability to query data in the Hadoop file system using SQL-like syntax. There's some conceptual overlap between Hive, HBase and Drill that requires some background and context to understand. The relevant courses do a good job of clarifying these relationships.
DA440 - Hive Essentials
Pig
Pig is a high-level programming language and framework for doing ETL (extract, transform, and load) tasks with data. I'm not sure how much Pig is used anymore with newer technologies like Spark offering similar capabilities, but I think there is still a use case for it.
DA450 - Pig Essentials
2. The Federal Government Has Abused its Surveillance Powers Before
While most Gen Xers were still very young and before any Millennials were born America went through similar controversies in the wake of the Vietnam War and the Watergate Scandal. In 1975, Senator Frank Church (D-Idaho) put together a committee (which would eventually be known as the Church Committee) to investigate abuses of the law by intelligence agencies. Abuses included spying on leftist activists, opening and reading private mail, and using the IRS as a weapon. Sound familiar? There's a reason why Baby Boomers have started comparing Barack Obama to Richard Nixon. The value of doing so has been lost to the ages; everything politically awful that happens in America is compared to Tricky Dick.
The defense that the current secret NSA/PRISM data collection plan can only target foreigners in foreign territory shouldn't settle anything, even if it's actually true, because that's just a description of how the plan is currently being used, not how it might be used tomorrow or under the next presidential administration. And we have absolutely no way of knowing that the description of how the program operates is true anyway, because the oversight has been hidden from public view. We do know that a court ruling in 2011 determined that the U.S. government had engaged in unconstitutional behavior in its surveillance program, but the Department of Justice is trying to block Americans from seeing this court ruling and understanding what happened. We're supposed to trust this oversight. We know they've broken the law once, but we don't know what they did, what's stopping it from happening again, what harm was caused, and whether there was any sort of punishment or discipline.
Next: Not even the government can really control where data ends up.
We've seen it time and time again. A journal publishes a seemingly significant scientific study which gains traction in the press only to be subsequently deemed irreproducible. This pattern is known as the reproducibility crisis, and our guest, University of Virginia Professor Brian Nosek, is trying to awaken the scientific community and the public at large to these challenges. Brian says the reproducibility crisis is not a new problem. Because scientists' career advancement is contingent on publication, the community is incentivized to create studies that tell a positive, novel and tidy story, known as publication bias, and leave findings out of publications that don't advance their conclusions.
In response, Brian, who appeared on Adam Ruins Science, founded the Reproducibility Project, which tried to replicate the results of 100 psychological experiments published in respected journals in 2008. In 2015, their results were published in Science and found that only 36 out of the 100 replications showed statistically significant results, compared with 97 of the 100 original experiments.
Some of these sounds discouraging and might make us doubt science. But the reality is that research is difficult and lab results are often messy and many times don't fit into neat categories. Brian argues that's actually the beauty of science and we should look at this issue as less of a crisis and more as an opportunity. When we realize we're wrong about our ideas about the world, it forces us to realign our worldview and think about our surroundings from a different perspective. Being wrong only gets us closer to being right!

A few weeks ago we announced that our LCS NA Head Coach, Sami 'Rico' Harbi, had to fly back to their home country France to deal with personal matters. In the meanwhile our LCS EU team coach Brokenshard flew out to LA to coach our LCS team. Even without Rico, our team managed to qualify for the Summer Split playoffs and are looking to bring their A-game.
Today we are glad to announce that Rico is returning to LA as our Head Coach which allows Brokenshard to focus on coaching our European lineup again. We want to thank Brokenshard for taking over on such short notice and we are also glad to have Rico back on the field to help our team prepare for playoffs in two weeks!

OTTAWA—An evangelical organization that describes homosexuality as a “perversion” and a “sin” is receiving funding from the federal government for its work in Uganda, where gays and lesbians face severe threats. Ottawa has denounced virulent homophobia in that East African country and Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird has condemned plans for an anti-gay bill that could potentially include the death penalty for homosexuals.
At an international conference in Quebec City last October, Foreign Minister John Baird, pictured in the Commons on Feb. 4, denounced abuses against gays and lesbians and specifically singled out Uganda in a speech. ( CHRIS WATTIE / REUTERS )
At the same time the federal government is providing $544,813 in funding from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) for Crossroads Christian Communications — an Ontario-based evangelical group that also produces television programming like 100 Huntley Street — to help dig wells, build latrines and promote hygiene awareness in Uganda through 2014. Until Tuesday, the organization's website carried a list of “sexual sins” deemed to be “perversion”: “Turning from the true and/or proper purpose of sexual intercourse; misusing or abusing it, such as in pedophilia, homosexuality and lesbianism, sadism, masochism, transvestism, and bestiality.” Lower down the page, the group asks sinners to “repent.”

“God cares too much for you (and all of Their children) to leave such tampering and spiritual abuse unpunished,” according to the group's website. Just hours after The Canadian Press contacted the group to ask a spokesperson about the site, the page in question disappeared from public view. Last October, Baird denounced abuses against gays and lesbians and specifically singled out Uganda in a speech at an international conference in Quebec City. “We will speak out on the issues that matter to Canadians — whether it is the role and treatment of women around the world, or the persecution of gays,” Baird told the Inter-Parliamentary Union conference. “Canada will speak out.” In that speech, Baird shared the story of a Ugandan gay-rights advocate who was bludgeoned to death in their own home.
That speech provoked an angry reaction from the head of the Ugandan delegation, Rebecca Kadaga, who accused Baird of “arrogance” and “ignorance” and demanded an apology. Crossroads defends its position on homosexuality as grounded in scripture.

“Crossroads' views on sexuality are informed by our Christian faith and values,” spokesperson Carolyn Innis told The Canadian Press in an email. They said the projects funded by CIDA do not include evangelical work and are focused on specific objectives. The government sought to keep its distance from Crossroads' opinion on homosexuality, “Our government does not endorse these particular views,” Baird spokesperson Rick Roth said in an email. “Canada's views are clear — we have been strongly opposed to the criminalization of homosexuality or violence against people on the basis of their sexual orientation.” The minister responsible for CIDA, Julian Fantino, has also said funding is doled out “on merit.” A CIDA spokesperson, Amy Mills, added in an email: “Canada's views are clear — we have been strongly opposed to the criminalization of homosexuality or violence against people on the basis of their sexual orientation.” They offered no comment on Crossroads' views on homosexuality. Steve Foster, president of the Quebec LGBT Council, said the federal government should stop funding groups like Crossroads. “It's unacceptable that the government would accept that kind of organization as an international-co-operation organization,” Foster said. “Taxpayers' money should not be used to finance religious groups working abroad, who furthermore contribute to the creation of discriminatory — even inhumane and dangerous — policy.” A study by the Canadian Research Institute on Humanitarian Crisis and Aid concluded that, between 2005 and 2010, the funding for religious non-government organizations increased 42 per cent. Secular groups saw an increase of five per cent. Less than 1 per cent of Crossroads' 2011 revenue of $23,249,813 came from the government, according to its Registered Charity Information Return filed with Canada Revenue Agency. According to the return, the charity spent $1,668,125, or about 5 per cent of its total expenses on overseas activities, programs and projects in 2011. With files from the Star's Marco Chown Oved

Lesley and I both love bourbon chicken and after tweaking a few different recipes we found online (was a lot of trial and error) , we have perfected our version. Also, before I get emails saying “WHERE IS THE BOURBON!”, we don't drink the stuff so there was no point in only buying it for this recipe. I could have called it something else, but it tastes just like other variations of the recipes I've had. So deal with it. This will make at a minimum of 4 servings. Let's begin!
Prep Time: 30-35 mins
Cook time: 45-50 mins
Ingredients:
2.5 lbs boneless chicken breasts, cut into small pieces. Seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and whatever else you like to season your chicken with.
1 -2 tablespoons coconut oil (or olive oil, veggie oil, etc..)
2-3 garlic cloves, crushed (FRESH NOT POWDER)
1/2 teaspoon ginger (FRESH NOT POWDER)
2 tablespoons ketchup
3/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/3 cup light brown sugar
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup apple juice
1/3 cup soy sauce
1-2 tablespoons of corn starch (to thicken sauce if need be)
2-3 cups of cooked rice (we start our rice cooker right as the first batch of chicken cooks) STEPS TO MAKE FOOD Heat oil in wok (or large skillet) Cook the chicken in 2-3 batches so it gets nice and browned. Set aside. Wipe down wok. Combine all of the ingredients (except for corn starch) in a bowl and whisk. Add to wok over medium heat to get everything dissolved Add chicken and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 mins. Enjoy a beer or 2. Add cornstarch in the last few mins if you want a thicker sauce or if yours just isn't reducing enough (also add one tablespoon of water per tablespoon of cornstarch you add). Serve over rice and drink a beer. NOM NOM

Apologies, but I got a little ahead of myself on Friday when I told you that the Motorola Droid would get the Android 2.2 "Froyo" update. Though Froyo will arrive as scheduled, the Droid will not receive the tethering and Wi-Fi hot spot features that the update can include.
Verizon Wireless did not disclose the omissions when it announced the update last week, but spokesperson Brenda Raney has confirmed what Phonescoop first reported this morning. "The Droid by Motorola doesn't have a Wi-Fi transmitter so there is no hardware to support a mobile hotspot," Raney wrote in an e-mail to CNET. Indeed, the Droid can transmit and receive Wi-Fi from a hotspot, but it can't act as a hotpot by itself for other devices.
As for tethering, Raney said that there is no connection on the PC side that will support the feature. Verizon originally promised tethering for the Droid last November, but it never extended its Mobile Broadband Connect service to the Moto handset. Even so, some Droid owners have rooted their handsets or used apps to successfully tether their devices.
Indeed, tethering and Wi-Fi hot spot functionality are not listed in the official service advisory on Verizon's Web site. Here's the full list of additions (PDF) that you should expect.

UnitedHealthGroup laid out a litany of reasons Thursday why it might stop selling individual health insurance through federal and state markets in 2017 — a move some see as an effort to compel the Obama administration to ease regulations and make good on promised payments.
Those problems, including low participation by healthy people, have led to financial losses, according to UnitedHealth. If not addressed, similar issues could affect other insurers, causing more to exit the market in the coming years, some Wall Street analysts and policy experts said.
Many said they anticipate the federal government will act to forestall widespread departures, particularly because continued withdrawals could be politically explosive during an election year.

A key piece of President Barack Obama's signature health care law, the online marketplaces, also called exchanges, opened in 2014 for people who buy their own insurance because they don't get it through their jobs. Enrollment, while growing, has fallen short of capturing the share of the eligible uninsured that was anticipated. This year, the marketplaces saw enrollment of more than 9 million customers, although the law's expansion of Medicaid enrollment in many states has also played a large role in reducing the overall number of uninsured.
Only a month ago, United sounded more optimistic about business on the exchanges. But in its unexpected disclosure Thursday, the insurer said it would cut its earnings forecast and projected hundreds of millions in losses stemming from the policies it sells through the health law's marketplaces.
The turnaround led some analysts to ask the insurer what had changed.
Stephen Hemsley, UnitedHealth chief executive officer, said too many healthy people dropped coverage and noted slower than expected enrollment. A major factor, they added, was far higher costs for those who signed up for 2015 coverage under special exemptions after the general open enrollment period ended. Those exemptions included, for example, people who lost their insurance, had a baby or moved. United said it did not see a similar increase in costs for people who bought policies from private brokers or websites instead of the government marketplaces after open enrollment, suggesting the reason was partly that the company's eligibility assessments were more thorough.
The firm did not say it would halt sales in 2017 but warned that it would strongly consider doing so based on what happens in the next few months.
“We cannot sustain these losses,” they told Wall Street analysts. “We can't subsidize a marketplace that doesn't appear at the moment to be sustaining itself.”
Although it's the nation's largest insurer, United captured only a small percentage of consumers who currently have coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, in part because it sat out the first year of enrollment and really ramped up only for this year's coverage.
While seen as a serious challenge to the health care law, United's decision alone doesn't mark the death knell for the exchanges. In remarks to analysts and press reports on Thursday, Aetna and insurer Kaiser Permanente re-affirmed their commitment to selling through the marketplaces.
HHS Spokesman Ben Wakana defended the government marketplaces, noting that 9 of 10 of policyholders re-enrolling have a choice of three or more insurers for next year. “The reality is we continue to see more people signing up for health insurance and more issuers entering the Marketplaces, and at the end of January, we believe we'll be looking at another successful open enrollment– just like the last two,” they said. “[Thursday's] statement by one issuer is not indicative of the Marketplace's strength and viability.”
But insurers, including Humana, Aetna and some of the large Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, were losing money or barely breaking even on their marketplace business, according to earnings reports.
“If there are no changes, all the large publicly traded companies will end up leaving,” said Ana Gupte, analyst with Leerink Partners. “But I would be very surprised if [the Department of Health and Human Services] doesn't do something to accommodate their issues.”
Those options would be limited to what the agency could do without congressional action, many analysts said. Still, that could include relaxing some regulations or reconsidering some of the exemptions that allow people to sign up after the open enrollment period.
Former insurance executive and consultant Robert Laszewski said the administration needs to relax the rules to give insurers more flexibility to design plans that would attract healthier people. They said the costs – including deductibles and premiums – were too high for many people, particularly those with few medical needs.
“Disproportionately, the sick are signing up and the healthy are dropping out,” said Laszewski, adding that alternative plans with fewer benefits but lower costs should be made available.
Economist Len Nichols cautioned, however, that most of the law's benefit requirements – taken individually – add little to the cost of a plan. Removing the bigger-ticket requirements, such as coverage for maternity care, would leave consumers without adequate coverage, said Nichols, who directs the George Mason University Center for Health Research and Ethics.
Nichols, Gupte and other analysts agree with the industry's trade lobby, which says one thing the administration could do is make good on a promise to pay insurers under a temporary program designed to redistribute profits from some insurers that did especially well to offset losses others experienced in the marketplace plans. That program, however, has paid only about 13 cents on the dollar of what was promised, mainly because fewer insurers than expected made money.
Earlier this month, HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said the administration is exploring ways it might be able to help make those payments, although such a move comes too late to save many of the dozen insurance cooperatives that have announced they will pull out of the market in January. The less-than-anticipated payments are often cited as a main factor in the co-ops demise.
Correction: This story was corrected on Nov. 23 to make clear that hardship exemptions do not trigger a special enrollment period.
'Email is dead' claims Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg as they launches 'Google Gmail killer' messaging service
Facebook is to launch its own email service, its founder said last night.
In a long-awaited announcement, Mark Zuckerberg unveiled their website's new messaging system and hailed the death of email as we know it.
The 26-year-old said it would go the way of the letter because it was too slow and too formal.
In its place they showcased Facebook's own version which integrates all web and text-based communications.
The service, perceived as a direct rival to Google's Gmail, marks a new front in the ongoing and increasingly bitter battle between Facebook and Google to gain the loyalty of users.
Bitter battle: Mark Zuckerberg unveils Facebook's new messaging service in San Francisco. Seen as a direct rival to Google's Gmail, it integrates all web and text-based communications and works instantaneously
Mr Zuckerberg revealed that, as rumoured, the 500million people signed up to Facebook will have access to a ‘Facebook.com' email address.
Entire conversation histories going back years will also be saved into users' accounts and spam will be completely filtered out, they claimed.
'We don't think that a modern messaging system is going to be email,' Zuckerberg said at a press conference in San Francisco.
'We want people to be able to communicate in whatever way they choose: email, text or Facebook message.'
Speculation had been mounting that Facebook's email account would be a ‘Gmail Killer', in reference to Google's successful email service.
Even though Zuckerberg denied this was the case, Facebook's 500million users will mean it poses a huge threat to all its competitors.
EMAIL BY NUMBERS
Hotmail: 362million users.
362million users. Yahoo!: 273million users.
273million users. Gmail: 193million users.
193million users. 'Facebook.com': Potentially 500million users for its new messaging service.
Hotmail and Yahoo! have 362million and 273million users respectively compared to Gmail's 193million.
Facebook's new email system is modelled on instant messaging and on-line chat and will allow people to simplify their communications regardless of how they choose to do it.
Texts, email or instant messages will all come into one ‘feed' and users can respond in any way they want.
One person could text a friend, for example, who will see the message come up on their Facebook page instantly and respond via an instant message or email.
Mr Zuckerberg said that they were changing Facebook because young people found email was too much of a ‘cognitive load'.
They said of the new programme: ‘It's not email. It handles email... along with all the different ways you want to communicate.
A grab from the new Facebook Messages service which is only available in the US at the moment but will be rolled out internationally soon
Domination: Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg talks about the new messaging service rumoured to be a 'Gmail-killer'
'It's true people are going to be able to have Facebook.com email addresses but this is not email. Email is one way people are going to use this system, but we don't even think it's going to be the primary way.
‘The goal of this product is to make it that we can seamlessly integrate across all of these different products very easily.'
Rivalry: Google has banned Facebook from importing its users' email contacts
Facebook's director of engineering Andrew Bosworth said that, over the course of time, users could look back on their relationships with friends going back years in a modern-day version of keeping letters in a box.
The changes will be rolled out over the coming months on an invite-only basis before being offered to all users worldwide.
Commenting on the launch, Eden Zoller, principal analyst at Ovum, said: 'An email service from Facebook makes a lot of sense.
'It has a huge base of 500million users that already love to communicate and share, and Facebook is giving them richer ways to do this through virtual gifts, games, location and even voice thanks to the recent integration deal with Skype.
'Adding email to the mix is a logical step and Facebook could tap into user data to provide an attractive, highly personalised service. You would also expect it to push mobile features given its big move in this direction. '
The move will certainly alarm Facebook's nearest rivals such as Yahoo! and Google.
In recent months the relationship between Facebook and Google has become increasingly fraught amid the poaching of staff and efforts to throw up barricades to prevent users from easily shifting information, such as email contact lists, between the two platforms.
Ease of access: Facebook aims to integrate text, web and email services for its 500million users
The changes to Facebook have been under development for more than a year and will be rolled out over the forthcoming months on an invite-only basis before going worldwide.
Last week, Google began blocking a Facebook feature that allows users to automatically import Gmail contact data into the social networking service.
Google accused Facebook of siphoning up Google data without allowing for the automatic import and export of Facebook users' information.
They are also increasingly vying for engineering talent in Silicon Valley. This week, Google internally announced plans to boost salaries by 10 per cent, according to media reports, in a move viewed as an effort to staunch an exodus of engineers and managers to Facebook.
Google has banned Facebook from importing its users' email contacts, a move it says it made because Facebook refused to allow the export of contact and friend data from within user profiles.
The expected announcement by Facebook comes as former internet big-hitter AOL is opening the doors to its new web-based email program, code-named Project Phoenix, for a limited number of users. Starting next year, anyone will be able to sign up for access to a beta test site.
The Project Phoenix inbox page was designed to make it easier to fire off a quick email, text or instant message with just a few clicks on a ‘quick bar' at the top of the page.
People can also send short replies directly from the inbox page, without having to click on a message first. The new design displays thumbnails of recent photo attachments at a glance, and lets people toggle between several open emails at a time.
Much about the Neanderthals is shrouded in the mists of time, but archaeology provides some clues. Their disappearance is one of the mysteries of early humankind. Several theories have been proposed. I'll put forth another; not entirely seriously, but to illustrate some important points.
It's unlikely that ideology predated the dawn of civilization, but unconsciously following a few leftist principles doomed the Neanderthals. (When cultural Marxism is running the show, the things that once were thoughtless mistakes are actively promoted!) Thus, their demise is uncannily similar to some of today's trends. The fate of the Neanderthals is a prime example of why packing greatly dissimilar societies into the same territory is a recipe for destruction.
What were Neanderthals like?
The stereotype is that Neanderthals were brutish knuckleheads, but that might be wrong. They had a somewhat larger average brain size than the Cro-Magnons, their later rivals. (Interestingly, the Cro-Magnons had larger brains than modern people do, something easier to believe with each passing year. Madison Grant and Lothrop Stoddard tried to warn us…) So they weren't complete morons. Survival in a very harsh climate—Europe and Central Asia during the Ice Age—meant that Neanderthals (and their little-known Denisovan cousins to the east) had the know-how to prepare for the brutal winters. They certainly didn't have a nanny-state government to bail them out if they couldn't plan ahead.
Neanderthal burial customs show that they cared about their departed, and we might deduce that they believed in an afterlife. They used tools. They made the first known musical instrument, a bone flute. The first realistic sculptures featured Neanderthal heads. They made cave paintings too. Although the Cro-Magnons were better at it, Neanderthals still were more talented than many artists today. They were physiologically capable of speech, so they likely had languages. All told, then, they did have culture, though what form it took is pretty speculative. In any event, there's no clear evidence they were any more savage than other Paleolithic population groups.
They were stocky, with large brows, eyes, and noses, and small chins. Other than that, they were very muscular. I'm a bit of a gym rat, but even Neanderthal chicks were considerably tougher than I am. The trade-off was that they had less dexterity than Cro-Magnons, as we can see by comparing their spearheads.
As for the Cro-Magnons, they evolved in East Africa perhaps as early as 200,000 years ago. They were likely bronze-complexioned, before spreading across the globe and adapting to local conditions, eventually becoming the races of today. They had pointy chins and somewhat square eye sockets, but otherwise looked a lot like we do now. What happened when these two peoples met?
Open borders immigration
The first contact was likely in the Levant. I can imagine how the conversation between two Neanderthals might have gone:
“Hey, Og, there are some new people coming in. They're tall and skinny, their heads look a little weird, and they talk funny. Who are they?” “They must be refugees. We should welcome them.” “Well, I don't want them taking our land.” “I'm telling you, one of these days someone around here will write a book that says ‘Therefore love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.'” “I'm just not sure about all this. How do we know they won't take our hospitality as a sign that they can play us for chumps? What's their agenda, anyway? Will they fit in and respect our values? How do we know that they're not going to take over one of these days? Why can't these tire, poor, huddled masses yearn to breathe free somewhere else? How do we benefit from letting in this wretched refuse from their teeming shore?” “You're such a reactionary, Grunk. This is the Fertile Crescent, after all. Resources are plentiful here, and I see that there are only a few of these immigrants right now. All they want is a better place to live. Surely they'll assimilate and learn our ways, and we'll all get along together if only we set aside our prejudices and open our hearts. Let's stop being xenophobic and give diversity a chance.” “Okay, Og, you've convinced me. We outnumber them now, we're stronger, and we're in charge, so we'll always be in control of the situation, right? Maybe they can pick our vegetables for us or something. After all, what's the worst thing that possibly could happen?“
Later, the Cro-Magnons had overrun much of the Middle East by about 36,500 BC. By 28,000 BC, they had taken over almost all territories that Neanderthals used to inhabit nearly exclusively. Mass immigration—then a careless lack of vigilance—is something aggressively promoted today.
This certainly led to resource competition. Due to the greater musculature, Neanderthals required about twice the caloric intake as modern people (including the Cro-Magnons, who weren't too different from us anatomically). It's basically the same reason why you can't graze cattle and sheep in the same pasture; the sheep chew the grass down to the ground before the cattle can get their fill.
The Neanderthals were very sparsely populated and practiced big-game hunting. That worked out fine, until people who could get by with greater population density came in and started eating all their food. Studies on the remains of the late Neanderthals suggest that malnutrition was fairly common.
Were they resentful that their hunting grounds were being picked clean by the newcomers? Perhaps that was like many conservatives today grumbling about fresh-off-the-boat immigrants milking the welfare system while staying home and making babies. The taxpayers (52% of the American population, as Mitt Romney indelicately observed) have to work to support everyone on public assistance, sometimes limiting their own family size because they're being taxed to death. We want at least a decent, middle-class existence (high resources) for our kids; those living on the government tit (low resources) have no such requirements. And on the subject of differential fertility rates…
Depopulation
The new immigrants, the Cro-Magnons, had a slightly higher fertility rate than Neanderthals did. The population change wasn't much per year, but over thousands of years it was very significant. Even so, the Neanderthals didn't have much to complain about, since the populations now invited to flood the Western world have a much higher fertility rate than the host populations.
Loading...
Why was the Neanderthal fertility rate lower? The real reason probably has to do with them being a little bit more K-selected. Still, I can't help but wonder if leftist ideology might have been involved. After all, much of their platform serves the depopulation agenda, for reasons which are pretty obvious. They aggressively promote anti-natal policies: abortion, homosexuality, the transsexual fad, the “childfree” lifestyle, even the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, etc. Leftists would dwindle away, if they didn't control the media and education systems to indoctrinate the public.
Were there any of the likes of Bella Abzug, Valerie Solanas, or Andrea Dworkin during the Paleolithic Era? We don't have any direct evidence of this, of course. Still, quite a few feminists bear more than a passing resemblance to burly cavewomen, so they might be throwbacks. And on the subject of looks…
Self-defeating diversity
When the exotic newcomers entered Neanderthal territory, they did what differing populations packed into close proximity eventually get around to doing. Those Neanderthals who hadn't been overcrowded to death ended up interbreeding themselves out of existence. The process began pretty quickly; hybrid skulls have been found, such as in the Levant.
Interestingly, there has never been any Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA found in any modern humans. This means that there are no female lineages. There are a few hypotheses for this. Jean Auel put forth a couple of scenarios in their Earth's Children novels, and that's all I care to say about it. Another explanation is that boys born from Cro-Magnon male to Neanderthal female crossings could have been infertile. Likewise, there may be something to another hypothesis as to why there are no Neanderthal Y-chromosomes today, but I won't bore you to tears.
I propose another reason why nobody has matrilineal descent from a Neanderthal woman. We at Return Of Kings are aware of the following indelicate facts:
Chicks dig big, tough guys with muscles. Given the choice, guys prefer chicks who are least likely to push them around.
So, Neanderthal men were attracted to the slender Cro-Magnon ladies who surely respected them, and let neither cultural differences nor exotic looks stand in the way of getting laid. Meanwhile, Cro-Magnon guys liked their women slender too. They weren't so enthusiastic about burly Neanderthal babes who would have written them off as betas and friend-zoned them anyway.
This undoubtedly drove the Neanderthal fertility rate further down. Because they believed that race isn't important (“only a social construct“, as it goes now), they nailed their own coffin shut. They scored some Cro-Magnon punani, but their descendants don't look very much like them.
As a result, most people have about 1-4% Neanderthal DNA; the numbers being slightly on the higher side for East Asians. That's about the equivalent of having one Neanderthal great-great-great grandfather, and the rest of your ancestry is Cro-Magnon. (If indeed fertile offspring was less likely, these matches may have been more common than we'd expect.) Pure Africans are the exception, since Neanderthals never went there. As for the rest of us, basically we're the Neanderthals now, but not very much.
So that's the story of the two ancient races which—after tens of thousands more years of evolution—developed into the modern races of humankind across the globe. Unfortunately for the Neanderthals, their unique looks and culture effectively became extinct a long time ago. Basically, these hardy Ice Age apex predators were surrounded by a faster growing population which overwhelmed them as time went by, and got assimilated to death.
Today's Social Justice Warriors would be delighted to do that to all of humanity today, destroying diversity in the name of diversity. If the globalist elites calling the shots get their way, not even the pure Africans will escape the pan-gaeic biological stir-fry, even though they're not the primary target yet.
Global warming
Here's one item where liberalism actually was right. Climate change removed the habitat where Neanderthals had a natural advantage, as they thrived in cold climates. Unlike today's hot controversy, global warming certainly happened; the Ice Age ended. Rising oceans ate up a tremendous amount of coastline. For example, the English Channel used to be only a river. What is now the North Sea was above ground. However, even if we could send Al Gore back to the Ice Age to warn everybody, it wouldn't have helped. Climate change happened because of natural forces, not people driving too many cars.
What could be done about global warming today? More nuclear power would drive carbon emissions way down. At the very least, it would conserve valuable resources. Next-generation designs (pebble bed reactors, thorium reactors, etc.) could be quite safe. However, nuclear power makes liberals quake with fear. Note also that the Obama administration ordered the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste disposal facility closed after billions were spent to get it ready, despite it being one of the safest places on earth to store spent nuclear fuel. Liberals refuse to consider uncomfortable subjects; Pizzagate being the latest example of this.
If anthropogenic climate change is true—I'll consider it to be one possible factor of many—then refusal to allow an expedient solution might submerge much more coastline. Many liberals believe we should severely curtail using modern technology. So some leftists (ecofeminism, Ted Kaczynski) think we were better off before industrialization—and a few (anarcho-primitivism) actually propose returning to the Stone Age—but I don't see many giving up their iPads, cell phones, and other gadgets.
Even when leftists make correct observations (at least arguably so), they can't find practical solutions. Thus, they're pretty much useless at public policy. Even worse is when they make short-sighted decisions to assuage their bleeding hearts. Often, this involves social engineering that eventually will destroy their own way of life if they get their way. Although they might long for collective suicide, they have no right to send their people the way of the Neanderthals.

Pulp games, like pulp movies or books, are meant to be enjoyable, with exceptional characters and a bombastic and exaggerated view of the world. But much pulp thrives on identifying with the downtrodden. Ballardian dystopias, with their themes of men and women being crushed by an unfeeling system, are the bread and butter of written science fiction. The best dystopian novels and films mire characters firmly in the day-to-day hopelessness of life before allowing them to rise above it.
The big AAA shooters that currently carry the mantle for most narrative gaming, though, often end up treating oppression as a fun tool to be wielded, not a thing to be overcome — even when they're ostensibly meant to do the opposite. They don't so much provide escape fantasies as they provide fantasies of never being affected in the first place, of being so far above the hoi polloi that the concerns with which the game is ostensibly struggling to come off as little more than window dressing.
Early promotions for Deus Ex: Human Revolution, the high-profile sequel to classic Deus Ex, played on the present-day anxiety over drugs like Adderall. "If I don't improve myself, if I don't augment myself, then I'll be less intelligent, less capable, less strong than the rest of the human race," said a character in a faux-expose of mechanical augmentations. Characters were shown being driven into homelessness trying to afford medically necessary immunosuppressants.
Dystopian games' concerns end up coming off as window dressing
When you started the game, your character was promptly revealed to have no need for the drugs, and despite nods to the contrary, the overwhelming ethos was not "How can I accept these changes to my body?" but "How long until I can afford the next upgrade?" BioShock Infinite, another game meant to interrogate how power corrupts, was described as "art" in part because of its shocking violence. The constant bloodshed illustrated that "Booker DeWitt isn't a good guy. He's a brutal, immoral thug," wrote Rus McLaughlin at VentureBeat. But when I played, I wasn't really disgusted with myself for killing hundreds of people. I was too busy figuring out the optimal way to cut through them in that slick, aesthetic way that BioShock Infinite offers.
As the famous (supposed) Truffaut quote posits, it's arguably almost impossible to make an anti-war film, and creating a mainstream game that effectively critiques its core mechanic is even harder. Power is fun: if I see an overreaching, draconian enforcement system in a game, I'm going to want to use it. All in all, I'm pretty comfortable with that. It is, however, strange to see anybody take these same games' social messages as anything more than a marketing strategy. Even if, in the past, I've done it.
Some game developers have talked about the problems of working in a narrative medium that strongly favors certain styles of play — particularly shooting and hitting. It's hard to get around this, and one of the cleanest ways to do so is just to embrace the implications, to show players how easily they can become brutal, immoral thugs. BioShock Infinite, obviously, falls into this, but so does the self-aware indie splatter game Hotline Miami, whose entire premise can be summed up in one quote: "You're not a nice person, are you?"
Do we really need help learning that, though? No matter how mildly discomfited you might feel playing an oppressor, it's far more uncomfortable and revealing to see yourself as helpless. From what we've seen so far in Watch Dogs, your power depends on a huge surveillance network that lets you spy on almost everyone you meet, turning you into a kind of vigilante NSA and letting you choose whether to use your power responsibly. Becoming the NSA might show us how easy it is to be virtuous or corrupted, but it ultimately won't help us work through the problem of being spied on by a hundred exceptional Aidan Pearces, and identifying with people who hurt people aren't a substitute for empathizing with people who get hurt.
3 bizarre things we learned about sex this week -- It gets better for married couples New research reveals partners ages 57-85 tend to enjoy more active sex lives than they do during middle age
Here are some new sex breakthroughs sure to bring smiles to faces and genitals around the world.
1. Scratching the 50-Year Itch
As anyone who is married, has friends who are married, or has seen a television show, movie or standup set surely knows, sex is frequent at the beginning of a marriage, but tends to taper off over time. But there's great news for people who miss having sex with their partners: if you stay married to the same person, you will experience a slight rebound, after 50 years of not so hot and heavy marital bliss.
Advertisement:
This is one of the main discoveries of the study, "Marital Characteristics and the Sexual Relationships of U.S. Older Adults," published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior, which looked at the marriages and sexual behaviors of 1,656 married adults ages 57-85. Another interesting discovery is that people who are remarried don't have have sex as frequently at the beginning of their marriages as those who are married for the first time.
The researchers offered various untested theories to try to explain the results. Samuel Stroope, a former Baylor researcher and current assistant professor of sociology at Louisiana State University hypothesizes:
It may be that the permanency of the relationship contributes to sexual relations picking up a bit at the end.... Growing old as a couple, with the experience and knowledge that come with that, may play a part. You are able to learn about your partner and build on that over time. You may have a higher level of trust when you feel that your spouse isn't going to go anywhere. The expectation that the relationship will continue may give you more reason to invest in the relationship -- including in sexual aspects of the relationship. As people age, they tend to be more even-keeled, which may help cut down on marital conflict and facilitate regular sexual activity into advanced age.
As for the less frequent sex experienced at the beginning of second marriages, Stroope surmised, "It may be that those who have been married in the past may not have as strong of a sense of permanence or lasting investment."
The bad news for those looking forward to an uptick in sex half a century later, is that a relatively small number of people actually stay alive or married to the same person for that long.
2. Penis Reduction Surgery Not Expected to Become a Popular Craze
Ron Albertson of Blaine, Missouri reported having penis reduction surgery in 1996. But that was in Waiting for Guffman, one of the greatest comedies ever made... ever, and not actually a true story. Fast forward two decades, and we have the first man to actually undergo penis reduction surgery in real life. The operation was performed in Florida on an unidentified 17-year-old whose penis was 7 inches long and 10 inches wide. The penis was also misshapen due to priapism, or painful prolonged erections.

According to Rafael Carrion, a urologist at the University of South Florida who treated the teen, “His penis had inflated like a balloon. It sounds like a man's dream — a tremendously inflated phallus — but unfortunately although it was a generous length, its girth was just massive, especially around the middle. It looked like an American football.” This left the boy unable to have vaginal intercourse with their girlfriend.
The doctors were able to perform what they referred to as a "double tummy tuck" for the penis. The doctors removed segments of tissue from each side of the penis, without damaging or removing any nerves related to sensation. According to Dr. Carrion, the new and improved organ is "slightly longer and slightly thicker than the average male... but now it looks symmetrical, and the patient was very satisfied.” They have experienced pain-free erections through masturbation and although they haven't had sex yet, doctors predict it will be a possible and pleasant experience, providing a happy ending, so to speak, to the teen, their girlfriend and anyone else interested in coming into sexual contact with the post-op penis.
3. One Pig's Bladder Is Another Woman's Vagina
The 17-year-old's girlfriend isn't the only woman with a happy vagina. A Czech woman received a new vagina at the University Hospital in the town of Plzen, in the western Czech Republic. The woman suffered from scleroderma, a condition that causes a hardening and thickening of areas of the skin as well internal organs and blood vessels and can restrict a woman's vaginal opening and decrease lubrication, which can make sex painful. The case was so extreme gynecologists were unable to perform examinations, and both sexual intercourse and healthy checkups were impossible. Although many women suffer from this condition, most are too embarrassed to see a doctor about it, according to Vladimir Kalis, head doctor of the Ob/Gyn clinic at the hospital.

The doctors performed a type of vaginal reconstruction usually used on women who have suffered a pelvic organ prolapse or urinary incontinence. In other words, it is usually used to make the vagina tighter, not to expand it.
Human donor skin or pig intestine can be used because pigs and humans share a similar genetic makeup. Pig tissue has been used for over 30 years, in fields ranging from dermatology to cardiology. Doctors made an incision in the woman's vaginal opening, then widened the vaginal walls using mesh made from pig intestine.
No other papers have been published on this operation and doctors believe it is the first of its kind.
What makes a good REPL?
Dear Reader: although this post mentions Clojure as an example, it is not specifically about Clojure; please do not make it part of a language war. If you know other configurations which allow for a productive REPL experience, please describe them in the comments!
Most comparisons I see of Clojure to other programming languages are in terms of its programming language semantics: immutability, homoiconicity, data-orientation, dynamic typing, first-class functions, polymorphism 'à la carte'... All of these are interesting and valuable features, but what actually gets me to choose Clojure for projects is its interactive development story, enabled by the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), which lets you evaluate Clojure expressions in an interactive shell (including expressions which let you modify the state or behaviour of a running program).
If you're not familiar with Clojure, you may be surprised that I describe the REPL as Clojure's most differentiating feature: after all, most industrial programming languages come with REPLs or 'shells' these days (including Python, Ruby, Javascript, PHP, Scala, Haskell, ...). However, I've never managed to reproduce the productive REPL workflow I had in Clojure with those languages; the truth is that not all REPLs are created equal.
In this post, I'll try to describe what a 'good' REPL gives you, then list some technical characteristics which make some REPLs qualify as 'good'. Finally, I'll try to reflect on what programming language features give REPLs the most leverage.
What does a good REPL give you?
The short answer is: by providing a tight feedback loop, and making your programs tangible, a REPL helps you deliver programs with significantly higher productivity and quality. If you're wondering why a tight feedback loop is important for creative activities such as programming, I recommend you watch this talk by Bret Victor.
If you have no idea what REPL-based development looks like, I suggest you watch a few minutes of the following video:
Now, here's the long answer: A good REPL gives you...
A smooth transition from manual to automated
The vast majority of the programs we write essentially automate tasks that humans can do themselves. Ideally, to automate a complex task, we should be able to break it down into smaller sub-tasks, then gradually automate each of the subtasks until reaching a fully-automated solution. If you were to build a sophisticated machine like a computer from scratch, you would want to make sure you understand how the individual components work before putting them together, right? Unfortunately, this is not what we get with the typical write/(compile)/run/watch-stdout workflow, in which we essentially put all the pieces together blindly and pray it works the first time we hit 'run'. The story is different with a REPL: you will have played with each piece of code in isolation before running the whole program, which makes you quite confident that each of the sub-tasks is well implemented.
This is also true in the other direction: when a fully-automated program breaks, in order to debug it, you will want to re-play some of the sub-tasks manually.
Finally, not all programs need be fully automated - sometimes the middle ground between manual and automated is exactly what you want. For instance, a REPL is a great environment to run ad hoc queries to your database, or perform ad hoc data analysis, while leveraging all of the automated code you have already written for your project - much better than working with database clients, especially when you need to query several data stores or reproduce advanced business logic to access the data.
How's life without a REPL? Here's a list of things that we do to cope with these issues when we don't have a REPL:
Experiment with interactive tools such as cURL or database clients, then reproduce what we did in code. Problem: you can't connect these in any way with your existing codebase. These tools are good at experimenting manually, but then you have to code all the way to bridge the gap between making it work with these tools and having it work in your project.
Run scripts which call our codebase to print to standard output our files. Problem: you need to know exactly what to output before writing the script; you can't hold on to program state and improvise from there, as we'll discuss in the next section.
Use unit tests (possibly with auto-reloading), which have a number of limitations in this regard, as we'll see later in this post.
A REPL lets you improvise
Software programming is primarily and exploratory activity. If we had a precise idea of how our programs should work before writing them, we'd be using code, not writing it.
Therefore, we should be able to write our programs incrementally, one expression at a time, figuring out what to do next at each step, walking the machine through our current thinking. This is simply not what the compile/run-the-whole-thing/look-at-the-logs workflow gives you.
In particular, one situation where this ability is critical is fixing bugs in an emergency. When you have to reproduce the problem, isolate the cause, simulate the fix and finally apply it, a REPL is often the difference between minutes and hours.
Fun fact: maybe the most spectacular occurrence of this situation was the fixing of a bug of the Deep Space 1 probe in 1999, which fortunately happened to run a Common Lisp REPL while drifting off course several light-minutes away from Earth.
A REPL lets you write fewer tests, faster
Automated tests are very useful for expressing what your code is supposed to do, and giving you confidence that it works and keeps working correctly.
However, when I see some TDD codebases, it seems to me that a lot of unit tests are mostly here to make the code more tangible while developing, which is the same value proposition as using a REPL. However, using unit tests for this purpose comes with its lot of issues:
Having too many unit tests makes your codebase harder to evolve. You ideally want to have as few tests as possible capture as many properties of your domain as possible. Tests can only ever answer close-ended questions: "does this work?", but not "how does this work?", "what does this look like?" etc. Tests typically won't run in real-world conditions: they'll use simple, artificial data and mocks of services such as databases or API clients. As a result, they don't typically help you understand a problem that only happens on real-life data, nor do they give you confidence that the real-life implementations of the services they emulate do work.
So it seems to me a lot of unit tests get written for lack of a better solution for interactivity, even though they don't really pull their weight as unit tests. When you have a REPL, you can make the choice to only write the tests that matter.
What's more, the REPL helps you write these tests. Once you have explored from the REPL, you can just copy and paste some of the REPL history to get both example data and expected output. You can even use the REPL to assist you in writing the fixture data for your tests by generating it programmatically (everyone who has written comprehensive fixture datasets by hand knows how tedious this can get). Finally, when writing the tests require implementing some non-trivial logic (as is the case when doing Property-Based Testing), the productivity benefits of the REPL for writing code applies to writing tests as well.
Again, do not take from this that a REPL is a replacement for tests. Please do write tests, and let the REPL help you write the right tests effectively.
A REPL makes you write accessible code
A REPL-based workflow encourages you to write programs which manipulate values that are easy to fabricate. If you need to set up a complex graph of objects before you can make a single method call, you won't be very inclined to use the REPL.
As a result, you'll tend to write accessible code - with few dependencies, little environmental coupling, high modularity, and tangible inputs and outputs. This is likely to make your code more clear, easy to test, and easy to debug.
To be clear, this is an additional constraint on your code (it requires some upfront thinking to make your code REPL-friendly, just likes it requires some upfront thinking to make your code easy to test) - but I believe it's a very beneficial constraint. When my car engine breaks, I'm glad I can just lift the hood and access all the parts - and making this possible has certainly put more work on the plate of car designers.
Another way a REPL makes code more accessible is that it makes it easier to learn, by providing a rich playground for beginners to experiment. This applies to both learning languages and onboarding existing projects.
What makes a good REPL?
As I said above, not all REPLs give you the same power. Having experimented with REPLs in various configurations of language and tooling, this is the list of the main things I believe a REPL should enable you to do to give you the most leverage:
Defining new behaviour / modify existing behaviour. For instance, in a procedural language, this means defining new functions, and modify the implementation of existing functions. Saving state in-memory. If you can't hold on to the data you manipulate, you will waster a ton of effort re-obtaining it - it's like doing your paperwork without a desk. Outputting values which can easily be translated to code. This means that the textual representation the REPL outputs is suitable for being embedded in code. Giving you access to your whole project code. You should be able to call any piece of code written in your project of its dependencies. As an execution platform, the REPL should reproduce the conditions of running code in production as much as possible. Putting you in the shoes of your code. Given any piece of code in one of your project files, the REPL should let you put yourself in the same 'context' as that piece of code - e.g write some new code as if it was in the same line of the same source file, with the same lexical scope, runtime environment, etc. (in Clojure, this is provided by the (in-ns ...) - 'in namespace' - function). Interacting with a running program. For instance, if you're developing a web server, you want to be able to both run the webserver and interact with it from the REPL at the same time, e.g changing the implementation of a route and seing the change in your web browser, or sending a request from your web browser and intercepting it in your REPL. This implies some form of concurrency support, as the program state needs to be accessed by at least 2 independent logical processes (machine events and REPL interactions). Synchronizing REPL state with source code files. This means, for instance, 'loading' a source code file in the REPL, and then seeing all behaviour and state it defines effected in the REPL. Being editor-friendly. That is, exposing a communication interface which can be leveraged programmatically by an editor Desirable features include syntax highlighting, pretty-printing, code completion, sending code from editor buffers to the REPL, pasting editor output to editor buffers, and offering data visualization tools. (To be fair, this depends at least as much on the tooling around the REPL than on the REPL itself)
What makes a programming language REPL-friendly?
I said earlier that Clojure's semantics were less valuable to me than its REPL; however, these two issues are not completely separate. Some languages, because their semantics, are more or less compatible with REPL-based development. Here is my attempt at listing the main programming language features which make a proficient REPL workflow possible:
Data literals. That is, the values manipulated in the programs have a textual representation which is both readable for humans and executable as code. The most famous form of data literals is the JavaScript object Notation (JSON). Ideally, the programming language should make it idiomatic to write programs in which most of the values can be represented by data literals. Immutability. When programming in a REPL, you're both holding on to evaluation results and viewing them in a serialized form (text in the output); what's more, since most of the work you're doing is experimental, you want to be able to confine the effects of evaluating code (most of the time, to no other effect than showing the result and saving it in memory). This means you'll tend to program with values, not side-effects. As such, programming languages which make it practical to program with immutable data structures are more REPL-friendly. Top-level definitions. Working at the REPL consists of (re-)defining data and behaviour globally. Some languages provide limited support for this (especially some class-based languages); sometimes they ship with REPLs that 'patch' some additional features to the language for this sole purpose, but in practice this results in an impedance mismatch between the REPL and an existing codebase - you should really be able to seamlessly transfer code from one to the other. More generally, the language should have semantics for re-defining code while the program is running - interactivity should not be an afterthought in language design! Expressive power. You may think it's a bit silly to mention this one, but it's not a given. For the levels of sophistication we are aiming for, we need our languages to have clear and concise syntax which can express powerful abstractions that we know how to run efficiently, and there is no level of interactivity that can make up for those needs. This is why we don't write most of our programs as Bash scripts.
Conclusion
If you've ever played live music on stage without being able to hear your own instrument, then you have a good idea of how I feel when I program without a REPL - powerless and unconfident.
We like to discuss the merits of programming languages and libraries in terms of the abstractions they provide - yet we have to acknowledge that tooling plays an equally significant role. Most of us have experienced it with advanced editors, debuggers, and version control to name a few, but very few of us have had the chance to experience it with full-featured REPLs. Hopefully this blog post will contribute to righting that wrong :).
EDIT 2017-08-28: this article has been discussed on Hacker News, r/programming and r/Clojure.
Daryl Gurney has become the newest member of the top 16 in the PDC this week.
The Northern Irish number one has moved into the top 16 on the PDC Order of Merit for the first time in their career, overtaking Australia's Simon Whitlock into 16th spot.
Gurney was just won away from climbing into the top 16 on Sunday, losing 6-2 to Joe Cullen in the semi-finals of Players Championship 16, but has now pushed themselves above Whitlock after the prize money from the 2015 European Darts Open fell off the two-year ranking list yesterday.
Elsewhere, Michael Smith has moved back into the top 10, at the expense of Jelle Klaasen, Ian White has leapfrogged Kim Huybrechts into 12th, and Benito van de Pas has climbed above 2015 European Darts Open champion Robert Thornton and up into 14th.

In King of Tokyo players take the role of their favorite [in-no-way-similar-to-other-intellectual-properties] monster and head over to Tokyo for some light-hearted mayhem and destruction. Players grab some chunky dice. By Jove, are these things chunky! I love the feel of them. They are like radioactive dice. I want to rub them on my face. Players then roll three times for optimum effect. The effect is some combination of attacking, healing, gathering energy [monster currency to purchase cards with different immediate and repeated effects like special abilities, re-rolls or extra lives] and gaining points [combos of three 3's, three 2's or three 1's for three, two and one victory point respectively].

How do I play?
Roll & re-roll chunky dice. Growl. Resolve chunky dice. Howl. Purchase Cards. Smash. Squeal in victory! Grumble in defeat!
You roll six [count 'em six] big dice, three [count 'em three] times which can do four [count 'em four] things [ah, ah ,ah!]:
Heal [designated by a heart] – Each heart replenishes one health. Attack [designated by a claw..RAWR!] – Each attack causes one damage to the monster inside Tokyo or all the monsters outside Tokyo, depending upon where the player's monster is located. Score points [1,2,3's] – Three consecutive numbers will give you that number of points. Then every extra of that number will give you an additional point. So, three 1's give you 1 point. Three 2's give you two points. Three 3's give you three points. Five 1's would score you 3 victory points [1+1+1]. Gain energy [designated by lightning] – Green energy cubes allows players to purchase cards for additional one-time, immediate or reoccurring abilities. Two energy cubes can be spent to wipe out the three cards displayed and pull three new cards from the deck. The cards can let you roll extra dice, manipulate the outcome of the dice rolls, provide extra lives, etc.
After rolling, a player can re-roll any dice two more times. After your rolls are complete, you resolve the results – deal the damage to other player[s], heal if not currently in Tokyo, gain victory points or gain green energy cubes. Then the player has an option of purchasing one of the three face-up cards with any accumulated energy cubes they have in their stores.
At the start of the game, all the monsters are outside of Tokyo. Your not-really-Godzilla or your so-not-King-Kong will eventually be the first to roll an attack. When that happens that player jumps into Tokyo. Our first KING! You see, Tokyo is a crowded city and there can really only be one monster in the city at a time [2 monsters if playing with 5-6 people], and the ensuing battle will determine how long the new king stays. Once that king dies or relinquishes the title of “King of Tokyo,” the last person to deal damage gets to jump into the vacated space, earn a victory point and start dealing damage to the rest of the players.
The game will continue in this fashion with players rolling, attacking, and jumping in and out of Tokyo, buying cards, and applying abilities. If a player's health falls to zero, they are eliminated from the game.
How do you win?
Mostly by luck, but there are two paths to victory; be the last monster standing or be the first monster to achieve 20 victory points. Players jump in and out of Tokyo from, what one can only assume, is a permanent, asymmetrical monster orbit around Japan. By delivering enough damage to cause the former king to return to orbit, a new king claims Tokyo gains a victory point. While in Tokyo, players attack all monsters outside of Tokyo and all players outside of Tokyo focus their attacks on the new king. Starting your turn in Tokyo gains you another victory 2 victory points for sticking it! Well done, but be warned, you are not allowed to heal in Tokyo, which means your time is generally limited.
You can hang back from the fray and concentrate on rolling numbers to gain victory points, or energy cubes to buy cards. You can be an aggressive beast and go on the offensive and attack anything that moves.
What was confusing?
Getting into Tokyo Harbor: In a 5-6 player game two spaces open for a rumpus: Tokyo City and Tokyo Harbor. Getting into Tokyo is simple – you jump in if you are the first person to roll an attack. Then as the king of Tokyo takes damage, they can yield Tokyo, forcing whoever did that damage to occupy Tokyo. Somehow we tended with no-one being in Tokyo Harbor since a person would deal damage to both occupying monsters, both monsters would retreat leaving one person in Tokyo and the harbor empty. The next person to roll an attack would then have to jump into the harbor.
What did you [dis]like?
Likes!
First off, I love brackets [] and use them all the time, deal with it.
I love the interaction and pace of King of Tokyo…usually…sometimes it can really, really, really drag on with two players. But for the most part it is good, fast, fun filler.
The sound of this game will bring spectators. It is full of rattling dice, frantic yelling and plenty of player interaction.
Dislikes!
Needs expansion to be fully played. If you get the base, spring for the expansion.
I feel it could use a slight dose of complexity.
As a home rule, I like to take n+1 cards [number of players plus one] and have a one player pick one and pass it to their left. This way each monster comes into the fray with a bit more of an interesting personality.
Just a tad pricey for what you get.
Player elimination. No one really likes being knocked out of the game. And it can happen quickly.
Would You Rather:
Would you rather play King of Tokyo or Zombie Dice?
Since zombies are played out more than giant monsters, I would rather play King of Tokyo.
Would you rather play King of Tokyo or Escape: The Curse of the Temple?
OOOO! I prefer co-ops to player elimination so Escape would probably be my go-to for a fast, furious, dice-rolling game…now if Queen Games would only send me a copy to review…
Would you rather play King of Tokyo or sit in the corner and wait for your copy of Rampage?
I, I…don't want to talk about Rampage…<<sits in the corner rocking>>…next question, please.
OK. Would you rather play King of Tokyo or the NES classic Rampage?
<<glare>> Don't make me angry…you wouldn't like me when I am angry.
Would you rather …
JOHN SMASH LITTLE MAN! RAAAAAWWWWR!! <SNORT> WOULD LITTLE MAN RATHER ARM OR LEG?
Whaaaah-what?!?
BOTH! JOHN REND! JOHN RELISH IN THIS PERSONIFICATION OF SOCIETAL CONTROLLED RAGE!!!
Unfortunately, King of Tokyo may be fired by Rampage. It may be more than fired, it may be rent from limb to limb. Rampage plays in 30 minutes, seems to be much more fun with the same general theme. The only downside is that it only plays four and the six player potential of King of Tokyo is still attractive. I plan on having a double feature with both games at one of my library gaming events and include the expansion of Kings of Tokyo to bolster the complexity but even then…I think this game may be moot once Rampage comes out. It just won't matter.
Closing Verse:
To tread the land of the king,
Does not come without its price.
One needs not ask me twice,
to roll these fetish-inducing chunky dice.
‘Cept the day Rampage came to town,
With meeples and cars and super breath!
The rowdy Kings of Tokyo did frown,
before being subtly, politely stomped to death.
PITTSBURGH -- Volunteer fire chief Paul Smith resigned from their position Tuesday in wake of a shocking message they posted on Facebook using a racial slur, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
In a statement to the newspaper, Smith said, "The media dragged my fire company and township into this as well as my family."
Smith's Facebook message grabbed national headlines and came amid the fallout after the Pittsburgh Steelers game Sunday, when the team decided to stay in the tunnel at Chicago's Soldier Field during the national anthem.
The fan reaction was mixed from support for the players to outraged fury over their decision. However, as CBS Pittsburgh reported, many local residents felt Smith's response crossed the line.
Smith, the chief of Cecil Volunteer Fire Station #2, posted a derogatory response on Facebook which directed a racial slur at Steelers' head coach Mike Tomlin.

Reaction to Smith's post in Cecil Township was quick and negative.
The Cecil Township Board of Supervisors said in a statement Tuesday that it's "deeply disturbed by the comments made by Volunteer Chief Smith, and in no way, shape or form condone their comments."
Dylan Pareso, who lives across the street from the fire hall, said, "I'm completely upset, especially for a town like this, coming from the fire chief, that's disrespectful in my eyes. I don't agree with it one bit."
Mary Plumley told CBS Pittsburgh, "For a fire chief or for anybody like that to say something like that is wrong. They don't need to be in that position."
"It's not good. No, I don't like it at all," Janet Vickers said.
Wes Leopold reacted to Smith's post, saying, "It's kind of a dumb thing to do. I think, there's enough tension in this country. He's definitely adding to it."
Chief Smith is out of the country on vacation, but on Facebook, they responded to CBS Pittsburgh.
"I am embarrassed at this. I want to apologize. I was frustrated and angry at the Steelers not standing the anthem. This had nothing to do with my Fire Department. I regret what I said."
"My fire department should have never been dragged into this. It was a bad judgement by me, for which I am very embarrassed, for them and my township."
Also Tuesday, the Steelers' president Art Rooney II released a statement on Twitter to reiterate that the team's decision to stay in the locker room was meant to remove themselves from making a political statement.

Meanwhile, Steelers lineman Alejandro Villanueva -- the only Steelers player standing outside the tunnel for the national anthem before their game Sunday -- said on Monday that the did not intend to make a political statement. They said the national anthem situation got out of control and they are taking the blame.
"Unfortunately I threw my teammates under the bus, unintentionally," Villanueva said. "Every single time I see that picture of me standing by myself I feel embarrassed."
A while ago we gave some love to “a galaxy far, far away” with 10 Great Options for Star Wars Gaming. While this wasn't an exclusive board game list for Star Wars, tabletop games did comprise the majority.
Well the conflict between the Empire and the Rebellion isn't the only “star” universe out there. So with that in mind, we are going to dive into our Top 5-Star Trek Board Games. Why Top 5 and not Top 10? To be honest, there really aren't 10 great (or even good) Star Trek Board Games. Once you get out of the Top 5, there are a lot of filler games like Star Trek
Trivia or Star Trek: Risk. We'll spare you those and just give you the best and brightest.
Updated: 4/15/17
Top 5-Star Trek Board Games
Honorable Mention: Star Trek Fleet Captains
Star Trek: Fleet Captains is a game for 2 or 4 players (and only 2 or 4 exactly) set in the “Prime Universe” of Star Trek. Each player takes on the role of a faction or race from Star Trek and will be exploring, completing missions, and competing with other players in various forms. Published by WizKids Games, Star Trek: Fleet Captains uses “Clix” dials made famous in their other line of products, such as Heroclix.
2 or 4 Players • Ages 12+ • 60 Minutes • $86
5. Star Trek: Attack Wing
Star Trek: Attack Wing borrows its mechanics from the much more popular Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures game. Using the FlightPath system, Star Trek: Attack Wing is a more combat focused games. Players will build out a fleet of ships from their faction (with upgrades, crew members, and other goodies), and duke it out with other race's ships. This is Star Trek combat at its finest.
2 Players • Ages 12+ • 60 Minutes • $30
4. Star Trek: Catan
The Settlers of Catan are one of the oldest euro games still being played. With Star Trek: Catan, this classic game gets a scifi spin on it. Star Trek: Catan is more than just a cheap retheme of this euro game, as it not only uses the familiar mechanics from Catan, but it adds its own twist. Now players can recruit members of the Star Trek universe to give them a unique special power. Once used, players will then switch their character to a new one letting different Enterprise crew members assist them throughout the game.
3-4 Players • Ages 8+ • 60 Minutes • $50
3. Star Trek: Frontiers
Star Trek: Frontiers, designed by veteran game designers Vlaada Chvátil and Andrew Parks, is actually based on the older deck building game Mage Knight. Set in the Next Generation era (and later), Star Trek: Frontiers has players taking control of their own star ship (2 Federation and 2 Klingon). During the game, players will be expanding their starter deck through exploration and fighting, with one of the main goals being to stop the encroaching Borg. Star Trek: Frontiers is a fairly heavy game, but still a lot of fun once you get the rules down.
1-4 Players • Ages 12+ • 60-120 Minutes • $60
2. Star Trek: Panic
Star Trek: Panic puts players in the role of crew members of the Enterprise as it attempts to complete its five year mission. In this cooperative game, the player's main goal is to try and keep their ship alive as they compete missions and fight off attacking ships. Winning the game isn't always easy as the threats are constant and fierce. Star Trek: Panic has some really great components and is easy the best of the *Panic line of games.
1-6 Players • Ages 8+ • 90 Minutes • $25
1. Star Trek: Ascendency
Despite being limited to exactly 3 players only (unless you get an upcoming expansion), Star Trek: Ascendency is easily the most epic and amazing Star Trek game out there. Each player controls an iconic Star Trek faction (Federation, Romulan, or Klingon) as they fight for supremacy in the galaxy. Players will be exploring new planets, colonizing, and, of course, waging war with other players. There is no game board in Star Trek: Ascendancy, you actually build out this modular galaxy as you play the game. This is Star Trek gaming at its finest.
3 Players • Ages 12+ • 180 Minutes • $35
ATHENS — After marathon talks with foreign auditors, the Greek government said Sunday that it had reached a deal on how to slash its unwieldy public sector by putting 30,000 workers on a scheme that would lead to early retirement for some and dismissal for others, in a bid to meet conditions set by foreign lenders for the release of crucial emergency loans.
The government also completed a draft budget for 2012, which is expected to be presented in Parliament on Monday and voted on by the end of October, and conceded that it would miss a deficit-reduction target of 7.6 percent of gross domestic product. The deficit is projected to equal 8.5 percent of G.D.P. this year. The deficit shortfall had been expected because of delays in carrying out reforms and a deeper-than-expected recession, with the Greek economy forecast to contract by 5.5 percent this year.
In comments made late on Sunday after a cabinet meeting, a government spokesperson, Ilias Mossialos, said Sunday's deal was the result of “long and difficult negotiations” with foreign auditors and that it constituted the “gentlest possible scenario in terms of social repercussions.”
According to the text of the draft law distributed to the local news media, 30,000 civil servants — or 3 percent of the public work force — would be put on reduced salary by the end of the year. The majority, some 23,000, are at least 60 years old and essentially would be forced into early retirement. The remainder would lose their positions through the merging and abolition of dozens of government agencies. Mr. Mossialos said the plan would save the government some 300 million euros, or $400 million, from the public sector wage bill in 2012.

The Greek government is in a race against time to convince representatives of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, known as the troika, that it will make good on pledges to put its financial house in order. Without the release of about $11 billion in aid — part of a 110-billion-euro bailout agreement reached last year — Greece could run out of money this month and face a default that would shake the euro zone and global markets.

The decision on whether to release the cash is expected to be made on Oct. 13 at an extraordinary meeting of European finance ministers, but it will depend on the troika officials, currently in Athens, issuing a positive report about Greece's efforts at fiscal overhaul. A chief source of frustration for foreign auditors has been the delays in carrying out reforms and an apparent reluctance by the government to reduce the country's public payroll.
The dreary weather has finally subsided in the Pacific Northwest, and the sun has officially taken over. Bees are buzzing, birds are chirping, the roses in my garden are blooming, and I'm craving fresh veggies like nobody's business. When the weather gets even a tad bit warm this time of year, my mind skips right over spring and jumps straight to summertime. Sixty degrees? Summer dresses and sandals, sunscreen and beaches, sprinklers, and zucchini. Lucky for me summer squash can be found in grocery stores year round because I'm full bore into summertime mode! Vegetable noodles are a particular favorite of mine during warm weather, so I made summer squash zoodles for a light, refreshing treat this week! If you're not in the low carb loop quite yet, “zoodles” are just summer squash noodles.
Don't forget to PIN it for later! ?
My summertime mindset isn't the only reason I was dying to make a zoodle dish. I was recently given a new spiralizer for my birthday! I had been using the Veggetti Pro , but had some safety concerns and was disappointed with its ability to tackle more substantial vegetables. My partner hooked it up with The Inspiralizer , and I'm happy to report that it is a significant upgrade!
They fixed everything wrong with the Veggetti Pro , and I couldn't be more thrilled about the gift. Way to go, honey! I will be putting The Inspiralizer to good use (I've already used it three times this week!).
Between my insatiable vegetable cravings and the new spiralizer, you can expect to see an influx of vegetable noodle recipes soon!
The Summer Squash Zoodle (Noodle) Recipe
The development of this recipe was super fun as it came together as a result of playing with my new kitchen gadget. I used two different types of summer squash zoodles: zucchini and yellow squash, and I spiralized each with a different size blade.
Caramelized and fresh red onion was used to create a compelling depth of flavor and a beautiful pop of color! The combination of red onion with yellow and green summer squash zoodles is quite striking; I was so excited to take pictures!
I fell back on a keto favorite and used bacon for both the cooking oil and main ingredient; I couldn't help myself. If you're limiting fat intake, you can choose to omit the bacon altogether.
To garnish, I used a blend of three Italian kinds of cheese: Parmesan, Pecorino, and Asiago. If you are dairy free, following a Paleo or Whole30 diet, just omit the cheese garnish and you're good to go!
Enjoy your summer squash noodles!

It doesn't matter whether your car is the soaped-up jalopy or whether it is a tumble down wreck; here are 10 misconceptions about cars. Some of them are serious, and some of them are still going the rounds in the humorous sections of websites pertaining to cars. Nevertheless, here are some popular misconceptions about cars which are cleared up including ordinary cars, hybrid cars and electric cars.
1. A car is always going to break down during an emergency: Only in the movies!
Photo Source: eastangliaservices.co.uk
Cars definitely do not break down in an emergency unless of course your particular jalopy is on its last breath and has not been serviced. So it is absolutely necessary that you go in for a servicing of your car as soon as possible.
2. There are no hydrogen powered car ideas in the market: this is a misconception which is doing the rounds and is absolutely not true.
All the companies out there including Toyota, Honda, and Renault etc. are working on plans using hydrogen powered engines in the cars of the future. They are also going through the blueprints, and you should definitely not be surprised that soon one car manufacturing company is going to come up with a hydrogen powered car, before its competitors can say Jack Robinson.
3. Stocks of hydrogen fuel are going to get exhausted very soon: this is not true.
Photo Source: folkecenter.net
For all those people who are interested in knowing about hydrogen fuel as the future replacement for gasoline and natural gas products, there is always the fear that hydrogen supplies are also going to peter out like natural gas resources are doing. Hydrogen is manufactured with the help of natural gas. And there are abundant stocks of natural gas available to us. Gasoline is manufactured from natural gas too. In the same manner we are going to get easy access to hydrogen as a fuel in the future.
4. A hybrid car battery does not last very long: if you do not consider an eight-year guarantee to be very long, ah well.
5. Hybrid cars are definitely not a good buy, because they have to be plugged in: wrong!
The battery recharges the car through the spinning of the electric motor. So the more you drive your hybrid car, the faster it gets charged.
6. Electric cars are so slow: wrong!
Thanks to their high-end torque, they are definitely very fast.

7. Electric cars are unsafe: wrong!
You will not have to worry about a shock when they are being charged.
8. Charging electric cars is a hassle: no, it is extremely easy to charge them in electrical sockets of 240 volts.

9. You can go a long way on empty: Yes!
Up to 2 gallons, thanks to the gas lines, but one would not advise it.
10. You can hotwire your car if you have lost your keys: Again a movie myth!

The new car design does not allow you to do so. So you definitely cannot hotwire your car, in just a couple of seconds with the clock ticking towards the destruction of the earth and the bad guys after you.
Summary: Are you interested in some popular misconceptions about cars, whether they are of electric, hybrid or ordinary cars? Look at these 10 misconceptions and get your doubts cleared!
“Brian, how do they know it's not him?” Private Moss asked.
“She just knows. They always know."
“But I've had the same training and I can't see any mark. I'm looking right through the scope. There's nothing on him. Can you see anything?”
“No. The equipment doesn't work on people like him. That's why she's in charge. They don't need the equipment. They have their instinct. And that's why we follow her.”
“I don't mean to be annoying sir but this is my first life-crime arrest and I'm nervous. I didn't think this was still possible … for them to hide from all the sensors and equipment.”
“Be quiet rookie.”
“C'mon. You're not curious? She's the only one in the division that's an Original. Well, that's what they say.”
“Shut up.  They are an Original. She's the only one who made it through all of the protocols … hell they established the protocols. And until anyone else is found, she's the only one.”
“Right, I get it. I'm just … I'm about to propose to them or something. I've never been around an Original. I'm slightly aroused to be honest. Have you ever been around one or is this your first?”
“No. I never have. Listen, if you keep talking I'm gonna shoot you. Just relax rookie. Let them make the signal and we'll go in to clean up any runners.”
“Ok sir. Don't shoot me.”
“Well don't make me.”
“Hey is all that shit true about what they did on their first day at the precinct?”
“What shit do you mean?”
“You know … the part about them being naked and killing everyone?”
“Oh that shit. You're a bit curious huh? You better be careful about that rookie. People have died for an emotion like that. But yeah it's true. I was there when they came," Brian said while gripping their gun.
Curiosity is a strange emotion. It's one of the emotions that is most sought after because of its potency. It's hard to find though because things are so very different now. In today's world there is a new way of feeling and understanding things for most people. Today we live in a place filled with a very strange set of rules.
People no longer steal televisions or cars. You don't have to worry about hiding your jewelry anymore. You don't have to invest in the latest alarm for your home because there are no home robberies. None of your things need protecting in this new world. No one flocks to their retirement planners in hopes of investing in the latest mutual fund to secure their future. Planning for your future is a waste of time.
What people steal today instead is the very life you have. They steal you and that's how they secure their future. Like I said, the world is different now. The people in it are strangers amongst strangers. No one knows who they are or were.
Life-crimes are the new thing and your emotions are the new high.
Not to be confused with Bonde or bind
A bond is an in-game item that allows a player to pay for selected account-related and out-of-game benefits such as membership, RuneCoins and Treasure hunter keys with in-game resources. Bonds bought with real money start off as tradeable.
Tradeable bonds may be traded to other players and sold on the Grand Exchange. However, when the transaction is complete, the bond will become untradeable. A bond is always bound to a player when it has not been redeemed or traded to another player. It is always kept on death, even when inside the Wilderness. Both tradeable and untradeable versions may be stored in a player's currency pouch, up to a total of 500. Players can only put an offer for one bond per Grand Exchange slot.
Contents show]
Uses
When purchased using real life currency, bonds are tradeable. Once traded to another player for an in-game sum of money or items, they become untradeable. Bonds can be made tradeable again for a payment of 10% of their Grand Exchange value (10% currently being 1,961,767 coins).
Right click options for the untradeable bond in inventory are: Redeem, Convert, Deposit, Use, Drop, Examine. Redeem allows you to spend the bond. Convert allows you to make the bond tradeable again (for a fee). Deposit places the bond (or bonds) in your bond pouch.
Redeeming
At any time, whether tradeable or untradeable, bonds can be redeemed for one of the following:
Membership: 14 days for 1 bond 29 days for 2 bonds (1 day extra compared to 2 bonds redeemed separately) 45 days for 3 bonds (3 days extra compared to 3 bonds redeemed separately)
RuneMetrics Pro packages: 1 month for 1 bond 6 months for 5 bonds (1 month extra compared to 5 bonds redeemed separately) 12 months for 10 bonds (2 months extra compared to 10 bonds redeemed separately)
15 Treasure Hunter keys
195 RuneCoins
1 character name change (if redeemed on a members server)
Treasure Hunter Daily Key (1 extra daily key, for 28 days)
If the player has both tradeable and untradeable bonds, the latter will be used first.
Other uses
Bonds can be:
Traded with other players
Sold for in-game money
Used to rent or buy up to five additional preset slots from the Gear interface (3 bonds each - note, you can alternatively buy 585 RuneCoins with 3 bonds, use 480 to buy the slot, and have 105 left over)

Controversy
A section of the RuneScape community found the introduction of bonds hypocritical and destructive to the integrity of the game, claiming that it was real world trading in the form of gold selling. This is due to the fact that the bonds can be bought with real-life money and sold for in-game gold.
Jagex has said that despite the controversies, bonds did reduce the amount of real world trading that occurred on non-legitimate sites; within one week of the introduction of bonds, the amount of real-world trading dropped by 61%, and the amount of coins that was transferred by real world trading was down by 81%.[11]

Trivia
Despite being tradeable, bonds cannot be placed in the party chest at the Falador Party Room, stored in the treasure chest from Carnillean Rising or a beast of burden; they may also not be staked at the Duel Arena or in Conquest. They also cannot be disassembled or fed to a baby troll.
When buying membership in the UK, two bonds costing £7.18, giving 29 days, are cheaper per day than buying a £7.50 30-day membership card, but more expensive than buying 30 days of membership directly for £4.95.
When redeeming bonds for RuneFest, the room number displayed in the example is "#237". This is a reference to Stanley Kubrick's film The Shining .

Run a motor race over a span of 92 years, and you are bound to attract some nutball machinery created by mildly demented but extravagantly innovative mechanical geniuses. Practically every possible iteration of the internal-combustion engine has appeared at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's 87 annual 500-milers at one time or another, as well as the odd turbine and enough double-overhead-camshaft powerplants to make aluminum lawn furniture for the entire population of Bangladesh.
Most have run on gasoline and methanol-alcohol blends with occasional doses of nitro. But there have been a few—five to be exact—propelled by the same murky gunk favored by long-haul truckers, bulldozer operators, and heating contractors.
We speak of that smoky, noisy, rattly road-crushing torque monster called the diesel. By all logical calculations, such an engine makes about as much sense in a racing car as Kathy Bates in a bikini. Diesels are low-revving stump pullers favored for heavy-lifting industrial applications. Owing to their size, bulk, and modest horsepower outputs when compared with conventional internal-combustion engines, few dreamed of employing a diesel at Indy until young Clessie Lyle Cummins arrived on the scene. A classic American backyard genius from Honey Creek, Indiana, with nothing more than an eighth-grade education, they had built their own automobile—engine and all—by the age of 15. As a fresh-faced kid of 22, they had served on Ray Harroun's 1911 Indy-winning Marmon Wasp pit crew.

By 1930, Cummins was operating their fledging diesel-engine manufacturing firm in Columbus, Indiana, producing neat and compact four-stroke four-bangers primarily for marine use. But the boat business was reeling under the Great Depression, and Cummins decided to take a crack at the Indianapolis 500 with one of their modified diesels, thinking it might generate the publicity boost their firm needed. Speedway owner and AAA Contest Board boss Eddie Rickenbacker, America's greatest ace in World War I, offered Cummins a spot on the 1931 grid with this proviso: The car had to average at least 70 mph (lap speeds for the all-winning Millers and Duesenbergs of the day were in the 110-to-115-mph range). It could then run as a "special engineering" entry but would be ineligible for prize money.
Rickenbacker was looking for entries of any form in the ravaged economy and was more than happy to welcome a Cummins diesel or practically any other race car that appeared at the speedway's gate. The year before they had introduced the so-called junk formula that opened the Indy 500 to stock-block engines up to 366 cubic inches (6.0 liters) after it was judged that the ultra-exotic 91.5-cubic-inch (1.5 liter) supercharged, high-revving straight-eights developed in the Roaring '20s were too expensive for current economic conditions.
Clessie Cummins commissioned August Duesenberg of the famed racing brotherhood to modify a Model A Duesy passenger-car chassis to accommodate a 361-cubic-inch four-cylinder, three-valve Model U marine diesel making 85 horsepower.
The new formula required a riding mechanic, an insane addition that produced terrible carnage until single-seaters were again mandated in 1938. The new Cummins arrived at the speedway weighing a hefty 3389 pounds, the second heaviest car in the field.
The driver would be Dave Evans, a veteran of three 500-milers, with expert wrench Thane Houser in the second seat. Evans easily broke through Rickenbacker's 70-mph barrier and qualified at 96.871 mph, although that was slowest in the field and 19 mph less than defending champion Billy Arnold's quick time of 116.080 mph.
The car had already run just north of 100 mph during a trial at Daytona Beach earlier in the year, and Cummins was optimistic that a pace in the mid-80s, without pit stops, could achieve a high finish. No one had ever attempted to run the 500 miles nonstop. Evans and Houser were fitted with extra padding in the car's cockpit to help them tolerate the pounding on the speedway's lumpy brick surface.
The Palm Beach Ballot Fiasco
(or, How Poor Design Undermines Democracy)
Isn't it conceivable that some voters may have assumed that the second hole corresponded to the second slot on the left, with the Democratic candidates? Unlikely, maybe, but certainly possible. And if someone made the mistake of punching the second hole, and then realized their or their mistake and punched the third one -- that's a perfectly human and understandable response, right? As it turns out, exit polls and anecdotes indicate that a lot of people really did misunderstand the ballot.
Now, the number of people who voted for Buchanan in that county is larger than the margin between Gore and Bush across the state. If a large number of the Buchanan votes were erroneous -- or if a large number of double-punched ballots were thrown out, which seems to be the case -- this design problem may cost Gore the presidency.
That should give you pause.
There have been a lot of news stories and explanations flying around about this issue. They have shown up some very common fallacies about design:
1. If people don't understand it, they'll tell us. Yes, but only if they know they're confused. If they really and truly think that the second ballot hole was Gore's, why should they report that they don't understand it? They do, as far as they're concerned. Among professional designers, self-reporting of usability problems is always suspect; direct observation of users is a much better way to discover problems with a design.
2. The arrows are obvious. All you had to do was follow the arrows. How could that possibly be hard? You'd be amazed, actually, at how easy it is to miss seeing something that's in plain sight -- or to see it consciously, and then go do something else subconsciously. The problem with the ballot is that there is an apparent correspondence between the lefthand slots (first Republican, then Democratic, etc.) and the punch holes; the lefthand/righthand alternation is unusual and unexpected. This is reinforced by the assumption that the two major parties are listed consecutively at the top. The arrows contradict these other two assumptions. Cognitively speaking, it's a mess! Not as bad as your average VCR or microwave, but bad enough.
3. Inspection by stakeholders who aren't design professionals is enough to verify that the design is OK. The Supervisor of Elections in Palm Beach, Theresa LePore, is a Democrat, and they were partially responsible for the design of the ballot. If they had noticed that the ballot layout may have cost their party critical votes, surely they would have said something. But could they see the problem? Probably not, and that wouldn't necessarily be due to incompetence or sinister motives on their part. Instead, the election staff should have had the ballot looked at by a design professional with training in cognitive science and usability techniques. Some design issues are not just "common sense." (If design was all "common sense," the design professions wouldn't exist, and anyone could design the cockpit of a 747.)
It has been said in some circles that testing the design on a representative sample of real voters -- a technique known as "usability testing" -- may have uncovered the problem. This is probably true. It's also likely, however, that a comparatively small percentage of voters actually had trouble: small enough to not show up in a small sample (e.g. 20 people), but enough to affect a large absolute number of people in the end.
4. If people don't read the directions, it's their own fault if they screw it up. This isn't just a fallacy; this is downright immoral. It's utterly uncompassionate. Do we really want to discount the opinions of citizens who are old, or tired, or distracted, or stressed, or just aren't quite up to our level of thinking? Sample ballots were mailed out in advance, but many people may not have have time to look them over. Or maybe they assumed that the voting would be easy (a perfectly reasonable assumption), and that they could figure it out at the voting booth. Or maybe they were illiterate, or didn't speak much English. It's a phenomenon that's well-known among designers: almost no one reads directions in advance, for this or other tasks.
The point is, written instructions are no substitute for decent design. Good design is cheaper in the long run, and much more humane -- it shifts the burden of difficulty off of the hundreds of users (or thousands, or millions) and towards the few people creating the design. In the hands of a design professional, in fact, good design can even be cheap up front. Take a look at this simple ballot redesign, done by Jeff Jansen:
Voting for the President is not rocket science, folks -- it should be simple enough for all our citizens to do it correctly and easily. The people who designed this ballot should take responsibility for the poor design, and a runoff vote (with a revised, clearer ballot) should be held. Otherwise, the people's trust in the voting process will be dangerously eroded.
It makes you wonder, actually, how many other elections have failed to reflect the will of the people because the ballots or voting booths have been poorly designed. We only know about this particular problem because the race was so close, and the stakes so high.
How much has our democracy lost to poor design?

Sorry this is a few hours late going up…just about all of MovieChopShop took a break this evening to geek out on Watchmen. More on that later, but now we have a new trailer for the J.J. Abrams directed Star Trek reboot/reimagining/sequel/parallel world thingy.
This looks like a whole lot of fun. It looks like a good movie, and it looks like it's a great opportunity to see Kirk become Kirk. What it doesn't exactly look like is a Star Trek movie. This screams “space opera” much more than the original series or original films which were much more akin to a submarine film (in my opinion).
Will this be another Star Wars style space epic? More action and explosions and harrowing moments? And if it is, does it matter as long as it is good?
As a non-diehard Trek fan, I'm honestly asking.
Without further ado, here you go.
The sad Truth Behind Bullying!
How Bullying affects one's Perspective!
Bullying doesn't always come as what we expect them to be. Most of the time, we think that it is just merely for fun for both sides the bully and the victim. However, looking into the victims perspectives, it may appear as everything is perfect and everything is good but what we don't know if that we see is the truth.
All victims of bullying will always try their best to show that they can stand the pain, embarrassment and the attack towards them, whether it is physical or verbal, to show the bully that it doesn't have effect on them. Though others will see it as a “Joke” and not as bullying but it will have unconscious effect towards the victim's behavior and self-esteem. This is true not only to school children but also at work and somewhere else. Victims will suffer one all of the following effects:
Depression. Due to unwelcoming words or attacks that the victim receives, this develops low esteem that causes depression.

As an effect of bullying, one will tend to stay away from the group as a sign of retreat but still anxious due to the nature of the environment and the people behind it.

Decrease in Academic Performance: Due to repetitive attack that the victim received, it causes too much depression and trust for themselves. This will eventually take away focus and determination because of self pity and feeling of self-worthlessness. This will have direct impact to their performance in their field.
Eventually, the victim will feel that they or they have no better place in the group and environment and will results to retreating from the real world, creating their own world that will somehow satisfy the needs that the real world can't satisfy (Schizophrenia ) or even results to SUICIDE while the bully is not aware of what they have done or completely blind of the sad truth of what they did.
Awareness is the key that will somehow educate victim on what they need to do and most especially to the bullies who are not aware of the effects of that they thought was just for “FUN”. Most bullying all started for fun among groups that will turn out into something that will create unwanted feelings among victims.

With the terror threat from ISIS growing, many of us rightfully warn of a “pre-9/11” mindset of lax government security. But that warning also applies to private citizens and business owners, who can do more to keep themselves safe instead of waiting for the state to step in.
The morning after 9/11 my phone began ringing off the hook. The calls were from CEOs of major corporations and banks and building owners and managers around New York City. Every request was the same: “We need to beef up our security. Can you send help quickly?”
I did — providing armed, trained professionals with law enforcement backgrounds at many of these locations. My company installed magnetometers in commercial building lobbies and searched the bags and packages of each person that entered the premises, employees and visitors alike. People thanked us, even after waiting on a line to enter.
At some locations, we deployed dogs trained in explosive-device detection. I had personnel stationed at loading docks and parking garages to search cars. We made what are referred to as “soft targets” — landmark buildings, commercial properties, residential locations — safer.
As the months went on, the calls began coming in again. This time the callers were asking, “Can you cut down on our security?” “Why?” I asked. The answers were all the same: “We're trying to cut costs; it's too expensive.”
These cutbacks soon became the norm nationwide. “Could you just give me an unarmed security guard to stand in my lobby? You know, just to sign people in.” “Can you give me that service for a dollar less per hour than what you're charging?”
I found myself bargaining with these real estate titans over a few dollars. But I also couldn't pay good, solid, reliable personnel what they deserved for the price that landlords and management were demanding. And forget about armed guards.
So here we go again.
Just over a week after ISIS terror attacks paralyzed Paris, Brussels is on lockdown. FBI Director James Comey says ISIS is in American cities now, too.
Safety has once more become a primary concern for commercial and residential buildings, and now the calls for enhanced security measures are starting to come in again. But have we learned anything from recent history? Are we just going to ramp up security for the next six months or a year?
The question, essentially, is this: Are we just going to react to such atrocities, or are we going to be prepared to prevent them?
I applaud NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton for recently speaking about security concerns at soft targets. The new NYPD Counterterrorism Response Unit will operate under the belief that terrorists intend to kill anyone and everyone they can as quickly as possible. Consequently, police officers won't take the time to negotiate; they'll act efficiently and without hesitation to save lives. The private sector now needs to step up and begin to do the same.
We can never eliminate a threat; however, we have the ability to minimize the carnage. The presence of enhanced security with armed, former law enforcement personnel at soft target locations is essential for the speedy preservation of human lives when these animals pay us a visit. A guard with a pen and a sign-in book won't be enough to stop an active shooter, whether it's a terrorist, a disgruntled employee or a party to a domestic dispute. There will be no time to call for backup.
It's time to learn from recent tragedies so that we can impede future violence.
The threat that we face must be dealt with on a day-to-day basis. With the holiday season upon us, we're especially vulnerable. Millions of tourists will be drawn to the city to see the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, the Radio City Christmas show and the Thanksgiving Day Parade. ISIS will view this influx of civilians as a perfect opportunity to spill gallons of American blood in our country's greatest city.
An attack can come at any time in any place, and the private-security industry must rethink what we can offer to keep American citizens safe not just for a day or a month or a year — but for the long term. For as long as we must.
An alarm has been sounded, and here in America — and especially in New York City — we're facing the biggest ongoing terrorist threat in our history. We must meet this danger with all the resources we have and not let up until we defeat this ISIS threat.

Re: Motivation to continue our fight? Don't concentrate too much on the past. Appreciate it, learn from it, but don't dwell there. Our struggle is now.
Your motivation is that if you give up it makes it easier for the next person to give up. You have converted some people; how will they feel if they see you bail?
The revolution starts with one person. It starts with you. It can be a simple act of defiance, like not watching tv, but that one little act can inspire your friends to do the same. And on it goes...

José Antonio "CoCo" Díaz (born February 19, 1963) is a Cuban-American standup comedian, actor, and podcast host. Born in Cuba and raised in North Bergen, New Jersey, Diaz began their stand-up career in 1991. They had roles in the television series My Name Is Earl and the films The Longest Yard and Taxi. Since 2012, Diaz has hosted the podcast, The Church of What's Happening Now, is a regular guest on The Joe Rogan Experience, and produced an autobiographical documentary.
Early life [ edit ]
Joey Diaz was born in Havana, Cuba as an only child. In the 1970s, their family had relocated to the United States and settled in North Bergen, New Jersey.[1] Their mother ran a bar and a successful numbers game operation. They were raised Catholic as a youngster and enjoyed learning stories about Francis of Assisi and St. Michael.[2] Diaz attended McKinley School and then North Bergen High School,[1] where they won awards for performing arts.[3] They graduated in 1982.[1][4]
Diaz suffered loss in their family early on. They lost their father when they were three, and found their mother dead on the floor in their home at 16.[5] They were taken in by four families around North Bergen during their teenage years, and credits about twenty people who helped him, but their reckless nature and tendency to get into trouble caused them to move from one home to another.[6] During this time, Diaz began taking drugs and committing crimes.[2] Diaz explains that their peers' sense of humor greatly influenced their comedy career,[6] and used lines from their teacher at McKinley School in their act. Diaz was also influenced by albums by Richard Pryor. Diaz wished to become a bookmaker initially, but changed their mind when they realized that it was not an honest way of making a living.[1]
In 1982, Diaz moved to Colorado. However, their growing homesickness led to their return to New Jersey initially for their birthday in 1984, but they stayed there for eighteen months. They later called this time as "the worst 18 months of my life" and "the biggest mistake of my life", as their cocaine abuse worsened.[7]
Career [ edit ]
Stand-up comedy [ edit ]
In June 1985, Diaz left New Jersey for good and returned to Colorado to study economics at the University of Colorado at Boulder. They did not enjoy their time there, and quit before taking up work selling roofing which earned them money, but they remained unhappy.[1] Developments in their life were interrupted by a stint in prison in 1988, following their arrest for kidnapping and aggravated robbery.[6] During their time in prison, Diaz would perform stand-up routines for their fellow inmates during the weekly film screening event when the projector broke. It took Diaz a further three years to try stand-up, despite being often told of their talent, and later called their entry into the line of work as "the last resort" as they had many other jobs in the past.[2] After seeing the 1988 film Punchline, Diaz responded to an advertisement for a $37 stand-up comedy course in the Rocky Mountain Post, and developed a blue comedy act. Before they did their first standup routine, they worked as a doorman at Wit's End.[8]
Diaz performed their first routine on June 18, 1991[9] at the Comedy Works in Denver at a show headlined by Matt Woods. In April 1992, prior to their opening spot for Troy Baxley in Boulder, Colorado, Diaz took cocaine before going on stage and had a set that they described as "a disaster". They then ceased to take the substance before a performance. After developing their act, Diaz entered the Beck's Amateur Comedy Competition and won. They initially lost another competition until the winner was caught stealing jokes made famous by Jerry Seinfeld and Diaz was declared the winner. Diaz claimed Comedy Works manager Wende Curtis promised them a flight to Los Angeles for a showcase spot at The Comedy Store for owner Mitzi Shore, but never received either.[8] Diaz went on to participate in a similar contest in Seattle, Washington, and finished sixth out of 40.[1] In 1994, Diaz returned to the Comedy Works and found Curtis had started a developmental program for comics which they joined. The process involved group writing sessions at Wood's home followed by sets in the club the same evening. At one point, Curtis banned Diaz from the Comedy Works before it was lifted after they met years later.[8]
In 1995, Diaz left Colorado for Los Angeles, California to try and make it as a successful stand-up comic. They used their divorce from their first wife, and the loss of contact with their daughter in the process, as a motivation so they "could come back and make them proud".[2]
On November 4, 2007, Diaz appeared in North Bergen to help raise money for North Bergen High School's basketball team uniforms.[4]
In April 2012, Diaz supported their Where I Got My Balls From documentary with the release of their stand-up special, It's Either You or the Priest. It went to number one on the Billboard comedy charts in the UK and Canada, and number one on iTunes.[10]
In December 2016, Diaz put out their first one-hour comedy special, Sociably Unacceptable, through the on-demand subscription services Seeso and Comedy Dynamics.[2]
Film and television [ edit ]
In 1998, Diaz received a contract to star in a television pilot, playing a bartender in a series titled Bronx County, after a talent scout at CBS saw them perform comedy in Seattle. The offer was a total surprise to Diaz, who initially did not believe them until they saw the talent scout possess tickets to have them fly to Los Angeles for the shoot. The series was not picked up, but the opportunity led to more work for Diaz, including an offer in their first feature film, a referee in BASEketball (1998), and a part in the television series NYPD Blue. In 2000, Diaz was featured in You Got Nothin' (2003), an independent film. Parts of Analyze That (2002), which starred Diaz, were filmed in Hudson County, New Jersey. They said, "That was big for me, able to come home to film".[2]
Diaz's profile increased with subsequent roles in Law & Order and their first major feature films, Spider-Man 2 (2004)[6] and Taxi (2004).[4] This was followed by a role in The Longest Yard (2005) as an unlawful union organizer, for which Diaz took several longtime friends to the premiere screening as they helped them face adversity in life.[2][4][6][11] Diaz secured the role after they learned a remake of the original was in production, and had lunch with Chris Rock and Adam Sandler, during which Rock said they could land Diaz an audition. Diaz proceeded to assemble an audition tape: "I went out and got a football jersey two sizes too small, pants two sizes two small with my butt hanging out. I got kids' football shoulder pads and ran around the field with a cigar in my mouth". Three days after submitting the tape, Diaz landed the role; the producers liked the name Big Tony Tedesco, which Diaz named themselves on the tape, and wrote it into the script.[12] Originally the part had a mere three lines, but Diaz' tape got their part extended.[11]
In 2005, Diaz expressed their wish to continue as a character actor, saying: "It's like a dream come true for me. ... I got my call and I have to make the most of it". Around this time prepared their one-man comedy show Larceny & Laughter, which featured stories while growing up in North Bergen.[11]
In 2007, Diaz appeared in four episodes of the television series My Name is Earl as Joey the Candy Bar Criminal. The show's producers wished to hire actors to play prisoners, and called Diaz after they saw them in The Longest Yard. That year, they had a stint as the host of humorous promotions for the Ultimate Fighting Championship as Joey Karate, giving karate instructions and comical predictions for upcoming fights.[4] Diaz regards their role in the 2009 television film The Dog Who Saved Christmas as a point of pride, as it allowed children in North Bergen to see them act. At the time of filming, Diaz weighed 390 lbs. By late 2009, they slimmed down to 295 lbs.[3]
In 2011 Diaz appeared in "Scarlet Ribbons", an episode of The Mentalist and the film Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star.[6]
Around 2011, Diaz raised $1400 from fans on Twitter and Facebook to finance a documentary about their upbringing in North Bergen, chronicling their life and how they were influenced by the various people who took care of them following their parents' death. Diaz pitched in $2,600 to complete it and by mid-2012, Where I Got My Balls From was produced with their podcast co-host and producer Lee Syatt as director, who shot six hours of footage in total. Diaz made the film in tribute to those who helped him.[6][10]
In 2013, Diaz secured a role in Grudge Match where they are seen alongside Robert De Niro as their coach. Diaz took their fifth grade teacher to the premiere.[2]
Diaz appeared in Season 2 Episode 12 of Maron.
In 2017, Diaz started work on a presentation based on one of their cats for Animal Planet.[2]
Podcast [ edit ]
In 2009, Diaz was introduced to comedian Felicia Michaels, who encouraged them to co-host a new comedy podcast,[8] Beauty and Da Beast launched in August 2010. In one early episode, Diaz recalled a story about setting a prostitute's wig on fire when they were young. The weekend after it aired, more people were turning up at Diaz's stand-up shows.[2][4][8][13] The podcast ended in November 2012 after 113 episodes.[13]
On September 2, 2012, Diaz launched their own audio and video podcast, The Church of What's Happening Now, which they co-host with co-producer Lee Syatt.[2][14]
Personal life [ edit ]
In 1991, Diaz divorced their first wife, during which they lost a relationship with their daughter.[2] On November 25, 2009, they married their second wife, Terrie Clark of Nashville, Tennessee.[3]
In 2007, Diaz ended their longtime cocaine abuse, after one of their cats ingested the substance and died. They later said, "It has to do with your peace of mind. For some people, it takes 10 years to acquire. It took me 30."[15]
Diaz is Catholic and practices Santería.[16]

Every Ohioan knows to watch for deer while driving, but what about an escaped horse and buggy?State Highway Patrol Sergeant C. Otis Smith and their officers had to deal with that exact situation yesterday in Wayne County, after being made aware that a riderless, buggy-pulling horse was galloping westbound down U.S. Route 250, in the wrong lane.Before the horse could make its way further down the highway and cause a serious traffic accident, Smith took action.“You have that second when it goes by you and you grab hold [of the buggy] and jump on,” Smith told thetoday. “I had to be quick.”Smith made it safely onto the buggy and promptly stopped the horse by taking hold of its reins. After slowing from 20 to 25 mph, the animal settled onto the ground (see below).A veterinarian confirmed that all is well with the horse, though it is, in Smith's words, "exhausted." The animal has since been returned to its owner.“I'm just glad it turned out okay,” Smith told the. “That could have been a bigger incident with a 2,000-pound animal running in the wrong lane.”

I always have many things I want to learn, accomplish, try and experience.
And starting a new year always gives that extra boost. As if you're starting from a clean slate.
I don't set a specific time or date to reach a certain goal to avoid stress or complicated situations. I just give in to the feeling of what I want to create or experience at any particular moment.
It's just more fun than trying to discipline myself to accomplish something, forcing myself not to procrastinate and then doing something I don't really feel like. I'd rather go with the flow. I get things done, but they are the right things at the right time.
Of course there's also a way to make things fun that don't seem to be fun in the first place. This requires some creative thinking. Sometimes I'll try to come up with things that will make a task more challenging, exciting, enjoyable, easier, comfortable, entertaining and off I go.
I do make lists of all the things I want and don't want in my life. And because there are many things I'd love to do, I always write them down to make sure I don't forget each and everyone of them.
Once I have written down all the things I want to do in the new year I select a top 3 of the most important ones that definitely have to be part of my life. All the other wishes will flow gently around the top 3 waiting for their turn.
So whenever I need some inspiration I take a look at my notes (I use Moleskine notebooks) and find something interesting to do, whatever feels good at that moment.
So here's my list for 2014
TOP 3
– Blogging
– Improving my musician skills
– Short daily Yoga sessions.
Depending on what kind of mood I'm in, the list gets more specific. For example: “Improving my musician skills” can change into “Working on intervals”, “Improving guitar speed”, “Ear training” or “Learning new licks”
Other things that are on my list as well:
– Meditation
– Mindfulness and Taoism
– Running
– Reading more books
– Less online
– Activities outside
– Discovering new music
– Simplifying
– Cooking new recipes
– Keep applying the 80/20 rule to life and business
– Jump rope
Of course the things on my list change throughout the year, that's how life is. Change is good. Change is refreshing and exciting. Some things come and go but there are also things that will stay with me for the rest of my life. They will flourish and grow.
So what's on your list for 2014?
What are your goals or wishes? What is the one thing you always wanted to do? What small changes can you make to make life easier, more exiting, fulfilling or more pleasant for yourself and the people around you?
What would you like to make more time for? Guitar practice, working out, meditation, song writing, spending time with your partner, kids or friends? What is the most important thing that should be added to your life or subtracted? Write it down and check your notes from time to time.
Please share your top 3 list for 2014 in the comments. I'd love to know.
I wish you a healthy, happy, mindful and guitar rocking new year!

Poe Baltimore – Preserving Edgar Allan Poe's Legacy in the Charm City
Poe Baltimore: Preserving Edgar Allan Poe's Charm city legacy
On our most recent show taping for the Baltimore episode, we got a chance to shoot a segment at the home of everyone's favorite creepy poet, Edgar Allan Poe. Locally, it is known as the Poe House. The good people at Poe Baltimore, a charity, hope to keep people interested in Poe's legacy and have them enjoy Baltimore's many other attractions.
“I became insane, with horrible intervals of horrible sanity.” -Poe
Admittedly, Poe's home is not in a great part of town, and it took great effort to keep their home from being demolished. The three story home is small. I mean, very small (600 square feet or so, for all three stories). Poe Baltimore has added Poe quotes to the walls, displayed their telescope, and even recreated their bedroom on the third floor. There's a Poe bust and an always prevalent Raven to look at when you enter, as well. Poe lived here when they were 23. There are also Poe tributes in the other cities they lived in like Richmond, New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston.
The future, more grandiose plan for Poe Baltimore is for a tour of of the city and all things “Poe.” Other must see sites for the Poe enthusiast are their grave, and the Sir Moses Ezekiel statue. Poe died just as they wrote…in complete mystery. They were picked up off the streets of Baltimore in 1849 in complete distress, incoherent and wearing someone else's clothes. They died at the hospital before anyone could get any information from him, muttering the word, “Reynolds.” Some say they were poisoned, but all records of their death were destroyed – fueling the conspiracy.
The Poe Toaster
From 1949-2009, starting 100 years after Poe's death, a mysterious black-clad visitor, known as the Poe Toaster, left a half consumed bottle of cognac and three roses on their grave, every year, for almost 70 years on January 9th. They mysteriously stopped in 2009.
If you're going to do your own walking Poe tour of Baltimore, I say finish it off at the Annabel Lee Tavern – with their Poe themed menu, and salute one of the greatest American writers of all time.

The way Aaron Rodgers looks in rehab has their teammate thinking the Green Bay Packers probably shouldn't have put them on injured reserve.
Linebacker Clay Matthews, while rehabbing their groin injury suffered in Week 11, got a firsthand look at the quarterback's progress from a broken collarbone.
"This past week, being a part of that rehab group, to watch Aaron, what he's been doing in there, I think we probably should have kept them off IR," Matthews told Tom Silverstein of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. "The way he's coming along, some of the balls he's throwing, accuracy-wise, everything a quarterback has to do, is pretty remarkable.
"So, it would be really neat to see them out there, but unfortunately, he'll have to wait two weeks prior to coming back."
Rodgers has to sit out a minimum of eight weeks under the IR rules. He's eligible to return to practice at the end of this week but won't be able to play in a game until Week 15 against the Carolina Panthers.
Since Rodgers went down in Week 6, the Packers are 1-5 with Brett Hundley lined up behind center. If Green Bay can get on a winning streak, Matthews thinks their season is far from over especially with the possibility of Rodgers returning.
"We have to win these next five. I mean, that's the reality of it," Matthews explained. "I don't have any 'relax' one-liners or 'run the table' or whatever. I'll leave that up to Aaron. But that's the reality of it. We have to get it done."
Matthews added: "Part of that is if you're looking at the big picture, I know no game is bigger than the next one. But we have to win these next two and when Aaron's back at the helm, we have a pretty good squad. That's the reality of it. So, hopefully we get to see them because that means we're winning ballgames."
If the Packers want to see Rodgers, these next two tilts against the Buccaneers and Browns are must-win.

The second part of Boards of Canada's 12″ single mystery has been found in London's Rough Trade East.
The Brick Lane store has confirmed the news on Twitter, and has posted pictures of it here, here and here. The single was sold to a customer two hours ago today (April 23), hidden in the store's racks in a similar fashion to the first single, which was found in New York's Other Music this weekend gone.
As with the copy found in Other Music, its sleeve reads “—— / —— / —— / XXXXXX / —— / ——” (note: with both this single and the last one, the XXXXXX occupies the fourth spot in the pattern, meaning that the theory that there has to be six of them placed around the world, in a similar fashion to the listening parties for past Boards of Canada album Geogaddi, doesn't necessarily ring true). The single was played once over the Rough Trade counter, but to our knowledge the music has not been uploaded anywhere yet, so we're not sure whether the music contained on the 12″ is the same 20 seconds as on the first single or different.
Meanwhile, BoC obsessives continue to theorise. The 2020k blog, which has been following the mystery since the start, points to a YouTube channel called Hell Interface (a past alias of Boards of Canada), who recently used this video (which is blank, but does feature an image if you hover your cursor over the timeline) to link to this one, which features a new number being read in the same style as the 12″ discovered in Other Music, followed by a brief flicker of some text: “—— / —— / XXXXXX / —— / —— / ——”. On top of that, the video is titled ‘csch'. csch.ca is the website for the Canadian Society for Circumpolar Health. Crikey!
Update: Looks like the third piece of the puzzle (—— / —— / —— / —— / —— / XXXXXX) was played on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show tonight, with no comment from the host. It reads out another number: 519225 (evidence here and here, audio here). So far then, the code is ‘—— / —— / 717228 / 936557 / ——/ 519225'. 2020k deserves a bloody medal at this point.
Update 2: NPR's All Songs Considered played another snippet at the end of the show, featuring the numbers 699742; not sure where these fit in the string (via Pitchfork).
To read up on the intriguing story of Boards of Canada's mystery singles so far, and the possibilities of a new album from the elusive duo, click here.
14-year-old Parkview High School Freshman, Caleb Christian was concerned about the number of incidents of police abuse in the news. Still, they knew there were many good police officers in various communities, but had no way of figuring out which communities were highly rated and which were not. So, together with their two older sisters: Parkview High School senior Ima Christian, and Gwinnett School of Math, Science, and Technology sophomore, Asha Christian, they founded a mobile app development company– Pinetart Inc., under which they created a mobile app called Five-O.Five-O, allows citizens to enter the details of every interaction with a police officer. It also allows them to rate that officer in terms of courtesy and professionalism and provides the ability to enter a short description of what transpired. These details are captured for every county in the United States. Citizen race and age information data is also captured. Additionally, Five-O allows citizens to store the details of each encounter with law enforcement; this provides convenient access to critical information needed for legal action or commendation.“We'd like to know which regions in the US provide horrible law enforcement services as well as highlight the agencies that are highly rated by their citizens. In addition to putting more power into the hands of citizens when interacting with law enforcement, we believe that highly rated police departments should be used as models for those that fail at providing quality law enforcement services”, says Co-founder and Parkview High School senior, Ima Christian.The problem-solving trio developed their love for coding when, as elementary and middle school students, they were exposed to MIT's k12 Scratch and App Inventor programs. Later, their parents encouraged them to learn JavaScript, HTML, CSS and the smatterings of Java. “We were surprised when we found a platform that enabled us to develop apps for both IOS and Android which was relatively easy to use and which allowed us to hit the ground running because of our knowledge of JavaScript”, said 14 year old Caleb Christian. “After finding a platform that was a good fit for us, we immediately moved on to creating each page for the app and Asha took over the look and feel design of the app. We all contributed to the creation of the product”, they shared.Co-founder and HS sophomore, Asha Christian, “We expect that all parents will want this app for themselves and their kids. We hope it will be one of the must-have apps on your mobile devices. Our goal is to make the app available to anyone, anywhere in the United States.” Five-O is currently in Alpha testing and will roll out to the public on August 18th, 2014, available to both Apple and Android. The Pinetart team has two additional apps in the pipeline and encourages interested users to like their page on Twitter and Facebook to receive a prelaunch version of their apps for testing and review.
Tax-optimised Architecture

The relationship between architecture and property taxation is a territory that is largely unexplored as far as I know. A few attempts are made to create tax incentives, primarily to create walkable neighbourhoods or to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. There is, however, an entirely different side of architecture influenced by taxation to explore: tax-optimised architecture, or the architecture of tax evasion. Tax-optimised architecture is a typology of architecture designed to exploit loopholes in taxation laws, preferably to avoid taxation entirely, or at least to minimise it. This means that the tax laws, or rather the areas not covered by them, become the primary factor influencing the design of the architecture. Architecture as an e contrario interpretation of the tax laws in short.
In Sweden, the ‘Friggebod' has been the primary expression of tax-optimised architecture. In 1979, the then-Minister of Housing Birgit Friggebo created a law allowing homeowners to build small sheds on their properties without construction permits. The sheds, maximum two per property, were not to exceed ten square metres in area (this was later raised to fifteen) or three metres in height, and were to be placed a certain distance from the edge of the property. Apart from these stipulations, there are practically no limitations on their design. Since the introduction of Friggebodar, Sweden has seen an explosion of construction of these sheds: twenty years later, there were already about a quarter of a million spread across the country; the exact number is unclear. Pretty soon, Swedes started to elaborate on the Friggebodar, maximising the limited area with temporary extensions and foldable walls to extend the sheds. One of the more radical examples was designed by architect Sören Stenqvist and exhibited at the H99 housing exhibition. Unfortunately, I've been unable to find any images of it. As far as I remember, it was a structure whose size could increase to double the regulation size, and then be reduced to comply with the legal ten square metres should the tax department pay a visit. I sometimes suspect that the real motivation for these elaborations is as much spite for the tax department as it is a real need for extra space.
The history of tax-optimised architecture is presumably as old as property taxation. History contains many legendary examples. Perhaps obviously, there is no recorded history of tax-optimisation of architecture, and most examples presented here are – from a scientific perspective – dubious at best. The most famous historic example in the Anglo-Saxon world is the window-tax imposed in England in the 17th and 18th centuries, which (legend would have it) gave rise to the expression ‘daylight robbery'. At the time of the window-tax's introduction, personal integrity was a matter taken very seriously, which prevented the state from basing its property tax on any of the more common parameters such as area or value of the building, as disclosure of such information would have necessitated an uncivil intrusion into the private life of the property owner. Thus, tax had to be based on elements discernible from the outside and somehow related to the value and area of the property; hence, the number of windows. As a result, three different tax levels were imposed on properties: those with less than ten, those with between ten and twenty, and those with more than twenty windows. Naturally, owners of buildings with eleven or twelve windows were disadvantaged and often bricked up a window or two in order to lower their taxes. New constructions were equipped with a number of windows in the upper end of the different brackets, and as a result, properties were often constructed with fewer windows than they normally would have been equipped with.
Another historical example is Amsterdam, a city with deep narrow houses with the gable facing the street. Allegedly, this was the result of a property taxation based on street frontage imposed during the critical centuries of the city's construction. The houses were often so narrow that furniture could not be brought up the stairs, and instead had to be hoisted up from the street to the upper levels. Each house was therefore equipped with a small crane. I'm sure there were other reasons as well, but to an extent, what we consider Amsterdam's vernacular architecture is an example of tax optimisation: a thrifty population elaborating on the opportunities to minimise their taxes.
The most radical example I have encountered are the trulli of Apulia, southern Italy. According to Bernard Rudofsky's ‘Architecture without Architects, 'These were built of “annual layers of stone that terminate in a false conic cupola crowned by a keystone”. The origins of this type of dwelling are disputed. Popular belief suggests that this peculiar type of construction was an innovative method of tax evasion. As they were constructed without mortar, they could be pulled down when word spread that tax inspectors were in the area, and then reconstructed upon their departure. The town could thus double its size, while its taxes remained at the level of a village. Again, this is a theory with little scientific and great popular support. In reality, the trulli's form is reminiscent of very early human settlements, and the constructions most likely predate property taxation.
Whether the examples above are true or just folklore, it is both exhilarating and somewhat unnerving to imagine vernacular architecture as not only the product of climate, available construction materials and local cultural traditions, but also the product of a profound unwillingness to pay taxes which is quite apparently engrained deeply in the human consciousness. In a sense, the extensions and elaborations of the small Friggebodar is part of a battle between people and tax inspectors that has raged since the dawn of taxation. Makes you wonder if tax inspectors really are the root of all evil and the creators of this type of architecture are righteous, justly standing up for their rights, or if people have just always been stingy.
It would be interesting to further study the effect of taxation on the emerging vernacular of the Friggebod and other contemporary examples. I suspect there is a great market niche here. I'm contemplating setting up an Office of Tax- Optimised Architecture, based in the Cayman Islands, developing new vernacular architecture around the world, generated by local taxation laws. Then again, I think there are a number of firms doing exactly this already- and with less conspicuous names. Venturi and Scott Brown focused on semiotics in their analysis of the Strip in Las Vegas, but it could be argued that the architects of tax evasion, along with their corresponding adversaries in the tax departments, are the authors of a parallel strain of vernacular architecture, running through history, individually tailored to the local conditions across the globe but as of yet uninvestigated.

MLS placed a representative on Forbes' annual 30 under 30 list released on Tuesday, with LA Galaxy attacker Giovani dos Santos making the cut for the rankings' sports vertical.
Dos Santos was joined on the list by a slew of star athletes and sports business executives, a group including Houston Astros star Jose Altuve, New Orleans Pelicans forward Anthony Davis, Chicago Cubs first basemen Anthony Rizzo and dos Santos' compatriot, champion boxer Saul "Canelo" Alvarez.
Signed to a Designated Player deal by LA midway through the 2015 season, dos Santos has 23 goals and 20 assists in 63 career regular season appearances with the Galaxy. The former Barcelona, Tottenham and Villarreal attacker endured a disappointing year on the club level in 2017, registering just six goals and three assists in 25 appearances as the Galaxy finished with their worst-ever record.
Dos Santos, whose younger brother Jonathan joined them in LA this summer on a DP deal, picked up a slight injury in Mexico's 3-3 draw at Belgium last week and was held out of El Tri's 1-0 win at Poland on Monday. They have 18 goals in 102 career caps with Mexico's senior team, and helped the country to the gold medal at the 2012 Olympics.
Prof Juan Carlos Kaski, St George's, University of London, UK
Research in recent years has shown that intestinal microbial organisms, collectively named ‘microbiota', take part in the metabolism of their host. (1)
Moreover, it has become apparent that the microbiota may play an important role in the development of metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Changes to lifestyle and an increased availability of energy-rich foods, are responsible for the worldwide obesity epidemic. Importantly, the gut microbiota can also have an influence on metabolic processes, such as energy extraction from food, and it has been suggested to represent “an environmental factor that contributes to obesity and its comorbidities (such as insulin resistance, diabetes and cardiovascular disease)” (2). For example, a gastric bypass contributes substantially to weight reduction and also lowers the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in obese subjects. (3,4) These observations have shed light onto the relationship between the gut microbiota and obesity. After a gastric bypass, diabetes can resolve before patients begin to lose weight, suggesting that this type of surgical intervention may have a direct “antidiabetic” effect. The mechanisms responsible for this association are not very well known at this point in time but a shift in the composition of the faecal microbiota of humans (5) has been suggested to contribute to the improved metabolic phenotype after a gastric bypass.
Studies in animals have shown a mechanistic link between intestinal microbial metabolism of the choline moiety in dietary phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) and coronary artery disease through the production of a proatherosclerotic metabolite, termed trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). A recent study by Tang et al (1) assessed the relationship among intestinal microbiota-dependent metabolism of dietary phosphatidylcholine, TMAO levels, and adverse cardiovascular events in human subjects. They quantified plasma and urinary levels of TMAO and plasma choline and betaine levels (liquid chromatography and online tandem mass spectrometry) after a phosphatidylcholine challenge, i.e. ingestion of two hard-boiled eggs and deuterium [d9]-labeled phosphatidylcholine in healthy volunteers before and after the administration of oral antibiotics, which eliminated the gut flora. They also assessed the relationship between fasting plasma levels of TMAO and major adverse cardiovascular events such as death, myocardial infarction and stroke during 3 years of follow-up in 4007 patients undergoing elective diagnostic coronary angiography.
The main results of the study were: 1. Plasma levels of TMAO were markedly suppressed after the administration of antibiotics and then reappeared after the withdrawal of antibiotics.
Increased plasma levels of TMAO were associated with an increased risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event (P<0.001). An elevated TMAO level predicted an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events after adjustment for traditional risk factors (P<0.001).
Thus the production of TMAO from dietary phosphatidylcholine is dependent on metabolism by the intestinal microbiota and increased TMAO levels appear to predict an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.
Certainly a new and promising field of research has now been opened as a result of data indicating that the gut microbiota may be a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases. Several avenues of research are being currently pursued such as supplementing the diet with non- digestible food ingredients, or probiotics that stimulate the expansion of specific components of the gut microbiota to improve metabolic pathways. Probiotics are certainly of interest as a suitable rational approach for the prevention of obesity and other metabolic conditions. Studies, however, are required and these have to be placebo-controlled studies with sufficient power to answer these important research questions.

Blue-banded bee a native beauty
By Bec Crew |
Contributor Bec Crew Becky Crew is a Sydney-based science communicator with a love for weird and wonderful animals. From strange behaviours and special adaptations to newly discovered species and the researchers who find them, their topics celebrate how alien yet relatable so many of the creatures that live amongst us can be.
THIS HAS TO BE one of the prettiest bees in the world. Named for the beautiful turquoise bands that run across its abdomen, the blue-banded bee (Amegilla cingulate) sports a lush golden and white fluff, enormous green eyes, and tan-coloured wings that look like crisp layers of cellophane.
Males can be distinguished from females by the number of blue bands they display – males have five while the females have just four. Adult blue-banded bees typically grow to between 10mm and 12mm.
The species is found all over Australia, except in Tasmania and the Northern Territory. It's also native to Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, East Timor, Malaysia, and India, so it enjoys a pretty healthy range, spreading out everywhere from urban areas to open fields and dense, tropical forests.
It's rumoured they're attracted to blue and purple flowers, perhaps because they could blend into their surroundings when collecting pollen from them, but this has yet to be proven.
They are known to frequent lavender plants, however, and according to the Australian Museum, they appear to be attracted to people in blue clothing. But it's cool because these bees are non-abrasive, and don't move around in intimidating swarms like other species, they live solitary lives in little burrows in the soil or the crevices of rocks.
Native Australian bees buzz pollinate
Blue-banded bees are one of a few native Australian bee species that perform a particular type of pollination known as ‘buzz pollination'. Also known as sonication, this type of pollination is really useful on crops such as tomatoes, blueberries, cranberries, kiwi fruit, eggplants and chilies, but the well-known and very common western honey bee (Apis mellifera), is incapable of performing this process. For this reason, the blue-banded bee is extremely valuable to Australian farmers.
A flower's stamen is its pollen-producing reproductive organ, and attached to the stamen is the anther, which is a one or two-lobed formation that holds onto the pollen. In some plants, the pollen is held so firmly by the anthers that it needs a little extra help breaking free, which is where solitary bees like the blue-banded bee come in handy.
These bees will grab onto the flower, and shake their entire bodies rapidly, causing both the flower and its anthers to vibrate. This shaking movement causes the pollen to be dislodged from the anther, and then be collected by the bee.
According to the University of Nevada's Leonard Lab in the US, about 8 percent of the world's plants need to be buzz pollinated in order to reproduce.
Here's an awesome video showing some blue-banded bees hanging out in Brisbane, looking like pretty turquoise jewels on a branch:

George Takei Believes 'Discovery' Is A Return To Gene Roddenberry's 'Star Trek'
Star Trek: Discovery has received the stamp of approval from of the Star Trek: The Original Series cast members.
Speaking to the Edmonton Journal, George Takei, who played Hikaru Sulu on Star Trek: The Original Series, revealed that they have been watching Star Trek: Discovery. Takei believes the new series is a return to the original vision of Star Trek after the more action-oriented JJ Abrams-directed Star Trek movies of the Kelvin timeline.
“I like it,” Takei says. “It's getting back to Gene Roddenberry's idea of infinite diversity in infinite combinations — and the use of sci-fi as a metaphor for current issues. With J.J. Abrams' (films), we got way off the tracks — great space operas, all that running through corridors, zipping through space. And I envied John Cho getting that skydive. But that was it — you didn't have that other dimension, the real throbbing heart of Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek.”
While we've written about how Star Trek: Discovery is carrying on the legacy of Star Trek, some fans disagree, mostly criticizing the show's look or perceived errors in continuity. The series showrunner has stated that diversions from canon will be rectified beginning in the show's second season.
In the interview, Takei also touched on their feud with co-star William Shatner.
“This is silliness,” Takei says. “There's unanimity among the cast mates, we've all had difficulties with Bill, but we're all teammates and we work together. When Brad and I got married, I asked Walter Koenig, who played Chekov, to be our best man and Nichelle Nichols to be our matron of honor. Nichelle said, ‘I am not a matron! If Walter is the best man, why can't I be the best lady?' We said, ‘Of course you are.'
“We thought the most natural thing to do would be to extend invitations to everybody. We sent Bill an invitation. There might have been some mistake in the mail. If they had called us before the wedding, we would have happily had him. We do conventions and we do cross paths. I'll say, ‘Morning, Bill.' And he'll say, ‘Morning, George.' And that's it.”
Star Trek: Discovery returns to CBS All Access on January 7, 2018.
Russian state-owned industrial giant Rostec has proposed working with China on developing engines for long-haul passenger jets. Both countries are developing domestic airliners, which currently use foreign engines.

“We proposed to the Chinese that we jointly create an engine for a long-haul aircraft based on the Russian PD-14 engine," Rostec spokesperson Viktor Kladov told RIA Novosti on the sidelines of the IV Russian-Chinese Expo in Harbin, China.
According to Kladov, Rostec hopes that the prototype engine will be ready by 2020.
Russia has been working on the Irkut MC-21, a twin-engine short- to mid-haul jet airliner with a capacity of 151 to 212 passengers, depending on the model and class configuration.
The producer hopes that the airliner will replace the aging fleet of Soviet-made passenger aircraft and compete for a share in the global market, thanks to its relatively low price and higher cruising speed.
China has been developing the twin-engine Comac C919, which can carry up to 158 passengers and has a range of 4,075km. A longer-range version can fly up to 5,555km.
Both aircraft have seen maiden flights in 2017. Russia's MC-21 has been powered by US Pratt & Whitney PW1400G engines, but the version for the domestic market will use the new Russian-made PD-14 engine.
The C919 is powered by CFM International LEAP turbofan engines of France-US origin.
The Trump Administration The 45th President and Their Administration
In much of the debate surrounding President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change, some critical points have been lost.
One reality is that the agreement was always going to reflect, more than determine, whether the world develops a sustainable relationship with the climate system. The language was intentionally “soft” on what countries pledged to do domestically. There was no other way to get nearly 200 sovereign states to the table. And there was little reason to aspire to more.
The forces both driving and constraining worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases are largely outside the top-down influence of some accord. Rising global energy needs and the enduring abundance of fossil fuels are driving fuel demand and emissions growth. Dropping costs of renewable energy, the increasing substitution of natural gas for coal, and a growing focus on energy efficiency in developing economies are slowing emissions.
But obviously the agreement wasn't soft enough for Trump, who made no mention of the clear risks from climate change laid out by their secretary of defense, James Mattis, after their confirmation hearing earlier this year, but warned of “massive legal liability” if the United States remained a signatory.
There were going to be setbacks no matter which option Trump chose, and it will take years for the consequences of their decision to play out. They included enough nuance — including the notion of working with Democrats to “negotiate our way back into Paris” or crafting something to replace it — to keep everyone guessing.
And separate from Thursday's announcement, they had already decided on steps that could undermine international action. For example, their earlier decision to cut funding to United Nations programs related to the climate agreement (not to mention funding for population programs) is going to have substantial adverse impacts on its own. And if their budget cuts for climate science and programs aimed at fostering environmental resilience are not altered by Congress, there'll be lots more real consequences not directly related to Paris.
Perhaps the most sobering, largely shrouded, reality is that the nations some have pointed to as the new climate leaders lose some of their luster on closer examination.
China and the European Union have used the Trump moves on climate and energy to assume, at least rhetorically, a leadership role in the public discourse over limiting global warming.
Both have garnered headlines for their aggressive and heavily subsidized pushes to expand wind and solar power generation. But while Chinese and German clean-energy policies and investments have driven the deep drop in the cost of solar panels, the economies of both countries remain heavily dependent on coal and oil.
China, while curbing domestic construction of coal-powered plants, has become a leading lender financing the construction of new coal-burning power plants in developing countries, according to a 2016 study by researchers at Boston University and the Institute for World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Science.
China is clearly past the peak of the domestic coal-burning binge of the early 2000s that fueled its dizzying recent rate of urbanization and industrialization. But it will be burning billions of tons of coal or turning it into cleaner natural gas for at least several more decades. Synthesizing gas from coal is great for curbing urban air pollution, particularly if the gas substitutes for burning coal as a domestic heating and cooking fuel, as is still common in China. But there's a climate cost, as Princeton researchers have found, because the energy required to synthesize the gas is supplied by, yes, coal, producing more greenhouse gases.
And Europe, while generally basking in the glow of the Paris Agreement, has been quietly lobbying the Trump administration since February to fast-track approvals of multi-billion-dollar terminals for exporting America's abundant shale-drilled natural gas as liquefied natural gas, or LNG, across the Atlantic. Who's the fossil fuel villain there?
In an interview in early April at a conference on sustainable energy in New York City, Maros Sefcovic, vice president of the European Commission for energy policy, said LNG exports were a central focus of meetings earlier in the year in Washington with Trump administration officials. The hope is to cut European dependence on piped Russian gas — and to provide the flexible power generation needed to balance variable output from solar and wind installations.
Later that month, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry used an appearance at the Bloomberg New Energy Finance meeting in Manhattan to announce the approval of a giant Texas LNG export terminal, owned by Qatar, ExxonMobil and others.
In an onstage discussion with Ethan Zindler of Bloomberg, Perry used a question on Paris to point out the difference between Europe's climate-focused public statements and its work to gain gas supplies. “We're out in the public and they're giving all these speeches about the Paris accord and all the things we're going to do, and we get into private meetings, it's like, ‘How do we get that LNG?',” they said, adding: “Don't get up on the front end and make all these speeches about how good you're doing, when the fact of the matter is you're not.”
It's important to note that expanded gas exports to Europe were also a goal of the Obama administration, both for economic and strategic reasons. President Obama had also urged fracking-averse Europe to do its own energy development, as well. Hillary Clinton, too, took heat from environmentalists during their campaign for their longstanding support of natural gas drilling, and natural gas exports.
In an email, Myles R. Allen, a climate scientist and policy analyst at Oxford University, said Trump's decision hinted at a bigger issue, simmering well beyond the United States, that would continue to hinder progress — the enduring abundance of, and demand for, fossil fuels:
The proposal to renegotiate the U.S. terms is interesting — is it just a distraction tactic? Perhaps, but if we really want to put the future of the planet first, we do need to think about how to make the agreement both more effective and more acceptable to nations with substantial fossil reserves — or the U.S. won't be the last one to jump ship.
It is worth noting that the site of next year's round of annual climate change negotiations, announced Thursday by the United Nations, will be Katowice, Poland — a city in the heart of the Polish coal belt. Poland signed the Paris Agreement along with the rest of the European Union last October, but only after gaining concessions allowing its coal use to continue.
Energy independence has been talked about so much for decades that many doubts it'll happen in our lifetimes. But the world may soon see a dramatic change over the next few years -- and that change is coming from Israel.
During my recent 10-day trip there, thanks to the Once in a Lifetime project by 24 Hebrew University students, I went to a facility run by Better Place -- a company that seems to have worked all the kinks out of making electric cars free of gasoline a reality. The cars look like any other car, and drive smoothly and silently (you can see video of me test-driving one here). Once charged, either at your home or at a station, the car can drive 100 miles without needing another charge.
The new twist? Rather than wait for a recharge, you can go to a battery switching station that will install a new battery in less than two minutes. They charge up your old battery for another customer.
This recycling of the battery will significantly drop the price of the vehicle down to $20,000 or less, the company claims. Better Place is confident that they can make the electric car very affordable. Customers obviously won't have to pay for gasoline, and maintenance will be cheaper. Plus, the vehicles employ a braking regeneration technology that will prolong the life of brakes.
The Israeli government has reduced the tax rate on electric cars down to ten percent -- from 79 percent -- to help get them on the road.
The system is ready. The staff answered every skeptical question posed to them by the audience, and they even had a pricing plan prepared. Customers will pay a monthly subscription to use the infrastructure based on how many miles they drive.
And this is coming very soon.
As you read this, Better Place is working to set up five to ten battery switching stations and thousands of charging stations around Israel for a test run this month. CEO Shai Agassi says that six months later, the cars will begin being sold, and they believe 100 switching stations will be set up and 1,000 electric cars will be added to the road per month. At least 92 Israeli companies have already agreed to convert some of their cars, and 17 local councils and municipalities have given the thumbs up to setting up charging stations. There are already 1,000 charging stations in Israel (and 100 in Copenhagen). Deals have been struck to build the switching stations in Australia, Canada, Japan, and Hawaii.
The significance of this cannot be overstated. According to War Footing, a book by Frank Gaffney and a team of national security experts, half of the cars in the U.S. are driven 20 miles per day or less. A “plug-in with a twenty-mile range battery would reduce gasoline consumption by, on average, 85 percent,” they write. But we're not talking about a twenty-mile range. We're talking about a range of about 100 miles with the ability to switch batteries if you need to drive longer.
One of the questions raised has been about the stress this would put on the electrical grid. Better Place says they are going to make use of alternative energy sources like wind power. The company is setting up its own energy infrastructure to take care of this obstacle and says electric cars are three times more energy efficient. Even here, Israel is making breakthroughs. Another company called Innowattech has developed the technology to generate electricity from generators in roads. The company says that it will not require extensive infrastructure construction and that the installation of generators on one traffic lane for one kilometer produces 220 kilowatts of electricity per hour.
However, not everyone believes the hype about Better Place. David Booth opines that the transformation in Israel isn't transferable to the U.S. because of the size difference. They say that the limited range of a single charge means there'd have to be about as many battery switching stations as there are gas stations at the moment.
They also argue that car manufacturers won't submit to one battery design, undermining Better Place's plan to use the same batteries for each customer.
Booth's first point puzzles me. If Better Place is successful in one part of the U.S., it will expand its operations just like any other business would. An immediate nationwide overhaul is not required. If customers are happy, the necessary revenue and demand will exist. As for the range, Booth doesn't seem to take into account that customers won't have to rely only upon battery switching stations. The charging stations that are much less expensive will be built in parking lots and you can count on the technology to improve and make each charge last longer as time goes on.
A valid point exists about car manufacturers wanting to design their own batteries, but we have to remember that they are businesses, first and foremost. Unless they want to build their own battery switching stations, they'll have to make them compatible with Better Place's facilities. Customers simply won't buy their cars if it's too difficult to exchange their battery. No matter how the capitalist competition ultimately unfolds, the point is that electric cars will have become a reality and businesses will be competing to make them as cheap and efficient as they can for consumers.
This is one of the few issues that all Americans can support wholeheartedly. It is great for the environment and will stimulate the economy as less money flows outside of the country to hostile governments. There may be nothing else that will as significantly shift the balance of power in the West's direction.
Virtually every country hostile to the West relies upon our oil dependency, and a steep drop in this dependency will set off a chain reaction in our favor. Chavez will find themselves struggling to fund the Colombian FARC. Ninety percent of the Iranian government's export revenue is from oil sales and they can't afford to lose a penny of it, especially as domestic consumption rises. Hezbollah, Hamas, and Syria will find themselves without the Iranian sponsorship they require. Radical Islamic groups around the world will see their wallets get thin as they can't raise as much money from the Gulf. The mosques, Islamic centers, and Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated organizations springing up all over the place with Wahhabi financing will find their construction halted.
Israel may be about to deliver its most painful blow yet to its enemies since its creation in 1948 -- without firing a single shot.
Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital [RCH] has asked that well-meaning Pokémon Go players refrain from dropping Pokéstop Lures around its buildings.
A number of Trainers have taken to Facebook groups all around the world with the charitable suggestion. In theory, it's a great idea: a Lure, placed on a hospital-based Pokéstop, draws more Pokémon to that area. Any Trainers that can access the Pokéstop benefit from an increased number of Pokémon to therefore catch.
In reality things are more complicated, as a response from the hospital itself explains.
“Patients at the RCH are among the sickest in Victoria,” a spokesperson from the Royal Children's Hospital told Stevivor.
“Unfortunately, Pokémon Go can create many challenging issues, as well as safety concerns, for the hospital and patients, and may impede medical staff in their work.
“We have lots of entertainment and distractions for our patients, who are confined to wards and unable to move about the hospital. Placing lures around the hospital, when children cannot leave their rooms, may create unrealistic expectations, and subsequently, much disappointment.”
Simply put, a Pokéstop just out of a child's reach will have the opposite effect the well-intended Trainer was hoping for.
“While we understand everyone's good intentions, we would prefer if people did not place ‘lures' at the RCH,” the spokesperson concluded. “We know everyone means well, and appreciate that the kids are in their thoughts.”
There are still a number of great ways to help the Royal Children's Hospital tend to sick children. Perhaps the best is to financially support the Royal Children's Hospital Foundation, an organisation that helps fund the hospital and its works.
Please help spread the word to well-meaning Trainers in Melbourne and abroad.

It moves the debate on, as Faisal Islam wittily quipped, only from ‘Brexit means Brexit' to ‘How Brexit means Brexit'. But it leaves unanswered the What: it tells us nothing about the shape our relationship with our European neighbours will come to take.
One might, warming to this theme, come to see it as a purely technocratic exercise in advancing to today a step that would otherwise be taken tomorrow. The European Communities Act 1972 – which translates into our domestic law the rights and responsibilities we derive from the United Kingdom's membership of the EU – would need to be repealed anyway. And the Repeal Act won't take effect until we leave the EU. It does nothing now.
All of this is right. And yet it misses the true import of what Theresa May announced.
Writing on the Friday following the Referendum I expressed the view – one from which I have not shifted – that hopes for our remaining in the EU rest largely on how events are sequenced.
Voters, when they entered the booth on the 23rd of June, and in their unwritten ledgers of Leaving and Staying, priced up present resentments and discounted future costs. The passing of time, ran the argument, would cause them to re-mark their concerns to reflect the reality of life outside the EU. When investment stalled, and jobs were lost, and public finances were hit, and the promised NHS savings were reversed, voters would revisit their ledgers. Public opinion would turn.
This may yet happen. And those who have fought and won the fight to Leave know it. It is this that spurs their sense of urgency. That is why we must Leave now and the consequences of acting precipitately be damned.
Only when you see the battle to Brexit in these terms can you begin to understand why Leavers have argued for exactly this solution: a Repeal Act, adopted by Parliament now, authorising a repeal of the European Communities Act later, with that later being a point in time to be determined by Executive Order. Now the result of the Referendum provides an impetus for Parliament to act. Now a narrative around the damage that would be done to democracy by ignoring the expressed will of the people might cause Parliamentarians to decontextualize the result from the circumstances in which it was obtained and the opacity of what it means. But later? Later, who knows.
So repeal now, prospectively, and place the means of delivering that repeal beyond Parliament, in the hands of the First Lord of the Treasury: the Prime Minister. Parliamentarians are amenable to the pressure of the electorate. But with their moderate flank left unprotected by an opposition party shamefully absent from the most important event in the life of our nation, the Prime Minister is accountable only to their own Conservative MPs. A future change in the tides of democratic opinion could not rescue them from the demands of their own Party.
And yet, and yet, all is not lost. The Great Repeal Act is also a mighty throw of the dice by Leavers.
There is a world – a world that at the end of last week seemed possible or even likely – in which MPs had no opportunity to vote on Brexit until it was too late. Article 50 would be triggered, negotiations would ensue, we would agree terms of separation with our EU partners, our membership of the EU would cease and then, and only as a tidying up exercise, would MPs formally be asked to repeal what had already become the empty vessel of the European Communities Act. The array of rights that it had conferred upon citizens of the United Kingdom would have dissipated already. It was this world that the Article 50 challenge – which will be heard in the High Court later this month and the Supreme Court in December – was designed to head off. Triggering Article 50 amounted to a functional repeal of the European Communities Act, ran the argument, and a member of the Executive can't repeal an act of Parliament.
But to deliver their Great Repeal Act Theresa May will have to persuade MPs to support it. To vote for an Act they cannot know the effect of.
It is true that the Great Repeal Act is a leap into the unknown. But to say this is to fail to do justice to quite how big a leap it is. There can hardly be an aspect of our national life that the EU does not touch upon. It is this that caused Theresa May to announce that alongside the repeal there will be a separate measure adopting as domestic law everything we currently derive from the Treaties. But even this does not do: for there is much of our law that must change when we leave: our membership of the Customs Union, our system of Value Added Tax from which we derive almost a quarter of all tax receipts, reciprocal healthcare and pension arrangements, and so on. What is to happen to all this?
So they will have to persuade MPs to support this leap into the unknown – and Peers too. If the Act takes the shape I understand it to, I believe the Salisbury Convention, which prevents the House of Lords from withholding consent to a measure promised in an election Manifesto, would not apply. And, although they are not a representative set, the members of the House of Lords I have spoken to are adamant that such an Act would not pass the Upper Chamber.
Most importantly of all is the opportunity the Great Repeal Act gives to an MP to table what a responsible Government would offer us anyway.
The binary formulation put to the electorate in the Referendum: “Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?” skated over the many parallel universes offered up during the campaign: lower and not lower immigration, inside and not inside the single market, money spent and not spent on the NHS, retained and not retained regional investment and agricultural subsidies, and so on. Without clarity as to what the question we put to the electorate meant, how can we interpret the answer they gave us?
Even if, at this early stage, MPs and Peers feel unable to resist a prospective repeal of the European Communities Act, they may be persuaded to adopt a measure that gave the electorate the chance to choose between the relationship we have with the EU, and that which our Three Brexiteers manage to negotiate for us. A referendum on that deal: that would be what taking back control from an unelected Executive really looked like.

Some people are fans of the Tampa Bay Bucs. But many, many more people are NOT fans of the Tampa Bay Bucs. This 2015 Deadspin NFL team preview is for those in the latter group.
Your team: Tampa Bay Bucs
Your 2014 record: 2-14. And yet 2-14 doesn't even begin to hint at how abysmal the Bucs were last season. This is the team that spotted a 6-10 Atlanta team a 56-0 lead after just three quarters, inspiring many stadium dick-pats in the process. They also managed to lose to the Rams after a Mike Evans injury resulted in a 10-second runoff of the clock. That's life under Lovie Smith for you. You don't even get the pleasure of seeing your team fuck up at the end of a game, because they fuck up BEFORE that fuckup, and squander the chance to fuck up that fuckup, and then they lose.
Also, a Bengals fan punched one of your fans right into the street. A Bengals fan! You know how weak and slow Bengals fans are? That's like getting punched out by a dying Labrador.
Your coach: Lovie Smith. There are certain head coaches who make for disastrous retreads, and Lovie Smith is one of them. We all think of Rich Kotite as a walking punchline, but Rich Kotite went 36-28 as head coach of the Eagles before they burned the Jets to the ground. It took that second job for their true shittiness to be laid bare. That's where Lovie Smith is right now. He's right in the Mooch Zone. Five months from now, when they stagger out of Tampa with five total wins to their name, people will ask, “How the fuck did THAT guy take a team to a Super Bowl?” And there will be no good answer. They're gonna resurrect those shitty Coors Light press conference ads just for the moment Lovie gets shitcanned. I can wait.
Your quarterback: FUCK Them RIGHT IN THE PUSSY! Congratulations, Tampa! You just won yourself 10 years of getting defensive whenever someone mentions collegiate rape accusations! I think you'll be impressed by how seamlessly FSU Twitter morphs into Bucs Twitter. You won't even realize what's happened until you've got yourself an egg avatar and you're beefing with everyone in sight. “This girl can't keep their story straight GET THE FACTS!” It's fun! And all for this guy …

Never gets old. It's the Buttfumble of college football lore. Remember: Jameis Winston threw 18 picks last year. Imagine sitting in a war room and saying to yourself, “Well, they threw 18 picks last year in an abominable conference. And they derped all over the Rose Bowl. And they stole crab legs. And they got suspended for doing the Tosh Serenade at the school cafeteria. And every other NFL fan will root for them to fail. And they may have raped a woman. And they couldn't even show their face at the fucking draft because they knew he'd be booed for possibly raping a woman. LET'S TAKE HIM FIRST.”
The most amazing thing is that the Bucs, like every authoritative body at FSU, were covering for Jameis even BEFORE they were stupid enough to draft him. They had to lay an intricate groundwork of rose-colored bullshit:
“To me, I think he's told us an awful lot with how he's handled it,” Smith said. “It's not like he's getting ready to go into the NFL and scrutiny is coming their way.”

Yes! In that way, I'm GLAD they were accused of rape! Really steels you for the rigors of pro football. If only EVERY prospect were accused of rape. It's the Oklahoma Drill of legal entanglements. TOUGHENS THE BODY AND THE MIND.
Of course, now that the Bucs have procured Winston, they're taking it one step further by trying to change the narrative and paint them as some kind of mutant football savant. He's a sponge! They study a lot! They aren't using training wheels! Their football IQ is wayyyy higher than their criminal IQ! Essentially, they're telling you that their football output will be so good that you will have no choice but to put the rest of Jameis' baggage out of your mind. Not only is this cynical—even craven—but it could also all be a pack of lies. Let's see that gif one more time…

That's against Oregon, mind you. Oregon doesn't even play defense. Don't try to sell me on this lumbering turnover machine before I've seen their fat ass play a single down. Fuck you for openly trying to polish that turd in front of America.
What's new that sucks: Apart from all that? Nothing much, really. Oh, wait! WARREN SAPP WON'T STOP BITING WOMEN. And pulling an Al Haynesworth on them to boot (no pun intended). Boy, this franchise really knows how to pick winners. Can't we take away their Super Bowl victory? They only won it because Oakland was literally too stupid to change their audibles.
Also: former kicker Lawrence Tynes sued the team for giving them leprosy. And the team was forced to start paying employees after the Tampa Bay Times found out they were using unpaid homeless people to sell beer, a scheme that would make Sepp Blatter cream their fondue in excitement. And get excited about the team's new RV lot! Yes, that's right: the Bucs have finally catered to their core demographic of nomadic NASCAR white trash. They may well put an infield at the 50-yard line so that Jethro and their kin and set up their tailgate. Bring back the mobile strip club! That was still the best thing ever about Bucs football.

Oh, were you wondering about what's happening on-the-field shit? Well, it's the Bucs, so they're still fucking terrible. Unless you count the addition of Bruce Carter and the immortal CHRIS CONTE as some kind of defensive masterstroke (it is not). They're still the Bucs, and they are still a living blood clot on your television screen. And their defensive backfield still handles receivers about as well as they handle contraband fireworks.
Also, Doug Martin sucks now. They don't even like being called the Muscle Hamster anymore, so they are both shitty AND humorless. They make me sad. Maybe Jameis Winston will trip over them and make me feel better.
What has always sucked: The alarm clock unis are back! The time is always BUCS P.M.!
Advertisement
What might not suck: Mike Evans! Holy shit, Mike Evans is a beast. He's gonna make Jameis look good, and it's gonna be such a letdown. I want Jameis to go 0-16, but they can just chuck the ball 30 yards down the field and Evans will probably catch it while standing on the shoulders of the man covering him. Don't fuck with Mike Evans.
Hear it from Bucs fans!
Anthony:
Our team trainer once cut the tip of Alvin Harper's finger off.
Chris:
The Bucs suck because we have gone from Raheem Morris to Greg Schiano to Lovie Smith and somehow GOT WORSE. We had the first pick for the first time in forever (despite always being awful) and we spent it on a talented risk recently accused of rape who is about to go through a massive distraction of a civil trial. Our best player is a HOF-caliber defensive tackle who nobody knows because in their 5 years in the league the team has combined to win like 12 games. Every game you go to feels like it is on the surface of the sun and you are likely going to sit next to a Bud Light soaked hick who is one Bucs turnover away from screaming a racial slur.

Greg:
I cannot think of a worse combination of traits than the average human attending games at Raymond James. The demo is the intersection of the venn diagram of Southern white-trash, Beachy white-trash and typical NFL fan white-trash. Brad Johnson is the best quarterback in franchise history.
Last year there was a QB controversy between Josh McCown and Mike Glennon. They fixed that issue by drafting the accused rapist from upstate with a creepy smile.

Ryan:
Five short years ago, I watched in person as the Bucs mudholed Seattle behind Josh Freeman's 5 glorious TD passes that put them squarely in playoff contention at 9-6 with one game left. I thought, “Damn, they might just be legit.”. They went 10-6 and lost the wild card tiebreaker to eventual Super Bowl champ Green Bay. Since then, they've gone 17-47. The Seahawks have gone 43-21 and won a Super Bowl. Fuck the Bucs.

Craig:
Ryan:
Ever since our team won the Super Bowl back in 1597, we quickly became every team's inspiration for how-not to run an organization. We have lost more games in the past TWO seasons than the Patriots have lost since 2008. And our big reward for winning two games last year? Drafting the horniest quarterback in league history. But things should work out OK since Tampa only has a strip club on every corner.

Joseph:
When I tell people from Florida I'm a BUCS fan they just stare at me in shock and wonder why. The next person from Florida I meet who is a Bucs fan will be the first.
Matt:
Warren Sapp is a Grade-A piece of shit. Welcome to Tampa Bay's Ring of Honor!
Wanna be part of the Deadspin NFL previews? It's simple. Just email me and give me ample evidence of why your team sucks: personal anecdotes, encounters with fans, etc. I'll throw any good material into the post and give you proper credit. Submissions will be cut off at some point. Next team up: Tennessee Titans.

It's not an ugly interface by any means, but shiny, translucent window frames are so last generation. Where's the style? In the big M's latest Building Windows 8 preview, of course.
Microsoft's Windows 8 developer preview greeted us with an interface steeped in Redmond's new Metro style -- its tile-centric start screen is sleek, fresh, and downright pretty. Imagine our surprise then, when the preview's desktop default view punted us straight back to the contemporary "Aero" dressing of Windows 7.The MSDN blog's latest Task Manager update shows the familiar feature in a clean Metro suit. Although Aero is still the OS' default look, the Windows 7 basic theme has been substituted for a style heavily inspired by Metro's clean tiles. The post doesn't say much on the matter (nothing at all, in fact), but it's nice to see the classic interface getting a facelift to match Microsoft's new look. Want to see more? Hit the source link below, it's got all the Metro window frames you could ask for.This post originally misstated that the updated Basic theme was a new style, but in fact, it is already available in the Windows 8 developer preview.
Scarlett Johansson‘s fans can buy them as a super-secret agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. in Marvel's “Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier,” but they aren't buying the tiny waistline they flaunt in a new poster for the upcoming film.
Backlash against the poster art, which features Johansson as The Black Widow with the body of a Barbie doll, began brewing online as soon as the image was released online Thursday, along with character posters of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Chris Evans as Steve Rogers.

“You know there is no helping the world when even Scarlett-Joh's already little waist is shopped to an impossible width in the ‘Cap' posters,” one woman tweeted, echoing the sentiments of many others.
Here's a small sampling of the less-than-favorable reactions to the poster:
The issue of editing images of women to impossible standards of beauty has been particularly hot as of late.
An Elle magazine cover obscuring Melissa McCarthy‘s body was criticized last November, while a time-lapse video demonstrating how Photoshop editing can completely change a woman's body image went viral last fall.
Elle also received backlash earlier this month after releasing February's “Women in Television” issue, which featured a photo of “Mindy Project” star Mindy Kaling cropped to focus on their appearance above the chest. Three other female TV stars featured on separate magazine covers for the same issue were pictured from above the knee.

Just last week, singer Nicki Minaj took to Instagram to protest the photoshopped cover of ESPN Magazine that they posed for with NBA star Kobe Bryant. A petition asking ESPN to stop retouching photos of celebrities and models that appear in the magazine was launched, as a result, and has garnered 3,200 signatures to date.
Marvel has yet to respond to TheWrap‘s request for comment on the reaction to Johansson's appearance on the new “Captain America” poster.

Take a look at a side-by-side comparison of Johansson on the poster and in real life to see if you agree with those bothered by the adjustments to their midsection.
Some of the first blue whales of 2012 in Southern California were spotted today on board the Christopher out of Harbor Breeze Cruises in Long Beach. Captain Carl Mayhugh and a group of lucky whale watchers came across a pair of blue whales near the Huntington Beach oil gigs. The whales fluked for the group a couple of times as they made their way around the rigs on the noon trip.
There have been numerous reports of an abundance of krill in Southern California waters recently which is a favorite food source of the might blue whale. While this may be a tad early for the leviathans to arrive in sunny California, the presence of vast quantities of krill may not only attract the giants but may make them less likely to leave.
Blue whales are the largest creatures to have ever inhabited the face of the earth. They can reach over 100 feet in length; that's three school buses. They have hearts the size of a Volkswagen and a tongue that weighs as much as an elephant. Adult blue whales weigh between 200-300,000 pounds.
Blue whales became a much sought after species for their large amounts of blubber. The killing reached a peak in 1931 when 29,649 blue whales were taken. By 1966, blues were so few that the International Whaling Commission declared them protected throughout the world. Today, there are between 8,000-9,000 blue whales in the oceans endangered species.
On the 3 p.m. trip on board the Christopher, Captain Mayhugh reported seeing 2 minke whales and 1 blue whale.
Seeing a blue whale in the wild is a one of a kind outdoor experience. To come face to face with this agile, enormous and enigmatic creature is something you will never forget. Hopefully, this is just the start of another incredible blue whale watching season.

A few well-regarded flagship devices, a focused core experience, a vibrant app ecosystem, and a belief in the quality of its own products: Apple lives and breathes these things, and has achieved massive profitability in the phone space as a result. And it's about the only strategy Microsoft has left to try.
Soon after purchasing Nokia's device business for $7.2 billion last year, Microsoft began to dismantle it—first laying off a third of the staff, and more recently waving goodbye to business unit head Stephen Elop and other top executives. Today it's writing off another $7.6 billion in impairment from the Nokia Devices and Services Business and laying off 7,800 employees. These actions tacitly acknowledge two errors: First, buying Nokia itself was a colossal mistake. Second, the strategy of making mass-market boring phones instead of eye-catching flagship phones was failing.
But ignore all the enormous numbers flying around, and focus on what's important. The $7.2 billion Microsoft paid for Nokia is the same amount the company doled out to shareholders just last quarter, in both share repurchases and dividends. Wall Street might be livid, but Microsoft's still got plenty left in the war chest.
Sure, they were gigantic. But no one has forgotten the Lumia 1520 flagship phablet.
The real question is whether Microsoft's Windows Phone strategy is still viable. And the answer is: yes—although Microsoft is now essentially betting the farm on a successful launch of Windows 10 Mobile this fall. Nadella pledged to bring to market a more “effective” portfolio of Windows phones, a strategy of tough love that managed to be both practical and aspirational.
“We plan to narrow our focus to three customer segments where we can make unique contributions and where we can differentiate through the combination of our hardware and software,” Nadella wrote in an email that the company published. “We'll bring business customers the best management, security and productivity experiences they need; value phone buyers the communications services they want; and Windows fans the flagship devices they'll love.”
A solid business experience, flagship devices, and budget phones. Well, two out of three ain't bad.
Going it alone
It's not entirely clear what Nadella's long-term strategy is. Optimists will note that Nadella explicitly states that they are “committed to our first-party devices including phones.” Pessimists, like analyst Jan Dawson, believe that Microsoft's strategy of pushing core services like Outlook, OneDrive, and more to iOS and Android is a hedge that gives Microsoft a graceful way to exit from the phone business if need be.
Windows Phone is synonymous with Microsoft, according to the latest AdDuplex numbers.
If Microsoft is going to make a go of Windows Phone business, it will have to go it alone. In June, AdDuplex's sample of Windows Phones found that more than 96 percent of them were manufactured by Microsoft.
“I honestly expected some of this, and it is likely, economically, a tough, but necessary choice,” Wes Miller, an analyst with Directions on Microsoft, said in an email. “It seems that there hasn't been a cohesive strategy for Lumia Windows Phones to date in terms of branding, marquee devices, or device evolution.”
Miller said they see Lumia's evolution unfolding like this: Microsoft will try to sell business customers on Office 365 and its Enterprise Mobility Suite, while Microsoft will abandon the low end of the market and focus on premium devices. Microsoft will then encourage budget consumers to adopt Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive on other devices to lure them into the Microsoft ecosystem.
Microsoft doesn't need dozens of budget phones, just older flagships that it can sell at a discount.
The Apple model: Do it right, do it yourself
Ideally, Microsoft's own first-party Lumia phones would stand as a Surface of sorts for the phone market. Nadella has been remarkably consistent with its message: They want Microsoft to create new categories of devices that others can learn from, emulate, and follow into the market. Today, we're seeing a number of well-built two-in-one PCs or ultrabooks that are just a bit more rugged than the Surface Pro 3.
But Microsoft's Surface model also assumes two conditions that the Windows Phone market lacks: a coterie of hardware makers trained to follow Microsoft's lead, and a healthy app ecosystem. Microsoft hoped to solve the first problem by seeding budget phones in the U.S. and abroad, boosting sales and helping to make the case that a viable market existed. Its more recent plan to bring iOS and Android apps to the Windows platform was designed to convince software developers that they could make money from Windows, too.
.@ZacB_ They released the Lumia 430, 435, 530, 532, 535, 540, 630, 635, 640 in about a year. It's just too many phones. — NotCassim (@NotCassim) July 8, 2015
Hopefully, Nadella's memo shows that its budget phone strategy was a mistake. Apple devotees can certainly tell you what components Apple built into the iPhone 6, but even the most ardent Windows Phone fanboy would be hard-pressed to differentiate one Lumia budget phone from another.
Apple has shown us that a phone maker doesn't need dozens of unremarkable budget phones. Instead, it marks down the price of yesterday's flagship. Neither does it depend upon a number of hardware partners eager to flood the market with their own knockoffs.
Nadir Aslam It's a phone! It's a PC! Continuum offers something else no other phone does, and Microsoft needs to sell this feature in a big way.
Another case for the Surface phone
I would argue that the core experience of a Windows Phone is as vibrant as anything Apple makes. But Microsoft needs to develop a flagship phone that can embody it. So far, something like the Surface phone has been merely a concept—but maybe it truly needs to become a reality.
This fall, Microsoft needs to proudly unveil Windows 10 Mobile and show how that its new operating system creates the best business phone on the market today. It needs to show how the new universal Office apps let users edit and even create documents on the road. And if, just if, they lose everything except their Windows phone, they can replace their Windows PC with a Windows 10 phone running Continuum. Those Windows 10 phones should be well-designed, desirable devices that will attract new customers and deepen the ties with Windows faithfuls.
Microsoft has said it will ship new flagship phones in the fall. Assuming that work is nearly completed, today's layoffs could be something more akin to game developers' being let go at the completion of a project. Microsoft's phone business should keep moving forward powered by its own momentum.
The real test will come this fall, when customers evaluate the new flagship phones, Windows 10 Mobile, and Microsoft's new strategy for its Lumia line. Only then will Nadella and the rest of their team grade Microsoft's phone business, and determine whether it will pass, or fail.
For decades, a sidewalk curb at Rose and Prospect streets in Hayward, Calif., tracked the slow creep of Earth along a notorious seismic fault line.
Then, last month, the sidewalk record was erased by a city crew, which replaced the curb with a wheelchair-accessible ramp.
The curb's disappearance resulted in the loss of one of the most visible historical markers of the Hayward Fault, which runs 74 miles along San Francisco Bay, parallel to the San Andreas Fault. Over time, as the Pacific and North American tectonic plates slipped past each other along the fault, the curb slowly pulled apart.
The resulting offset was a perfect demonstration of the Hayward Fault's steady movement of a few millimeters a year, said Luther Strayer, a structural geologist at California State University, East Bay. They brought their students on field trips to the curb every year.

The bad news from this week's episode of The Bachelorette is that fan-favorite Ben H. was sent home. The good news? We can now start our official campaign for them to be the next Bachelor!
The episode began with arch-enemies Nick and Shawn ending their heated conversation — with Part 2 of the battle coming later — and Kaitlyn and Ben having an incredible, drama-free overnight date. However, despite Ben's good looks and way with words, they got the boot, leaving Kaitlyn to meet their final two guys' families. The two hours ended with Kaitlyn in tears as they ponder which guy they want to spend the rest of their life with.
The Bachelorette's Chris Harrison: I'm beginning to believe Nick is in love with Kaitlyn
In our weekly interview, host Chris Harrison shares why Ben never had a chance and teases both the upcoming "Men Tell All" special and the "train wreck" that is the season finale.
Ben and Kaitlyn had a great overnight date, but they still got sent home. They seem like such a great guy!
Chris Harrison:  They are a great guy, and what you see is what you get. He's so handsome, has a great self-deprecating sense of humor, and he's down to earth, which is rare when you find a guy with a package like that — God doesn't give it all to you! I just think Kaitlyn was so into Nick and Shawn that I don't know if Ben even had a chance. I think they tried to keep those doors open as much as they could, but at the end of the day Nick and Shawn were so much the front-runners that I don't know if guys like Ben or Jared ever [could've made it to the end]. It was a huge struggle for Kaitlyn. I think they realized, like, "In what world am I saying goodbye to this guy?"
So, can they be the Bachelor?
Harrison: I think they could be the one. I can pretty much guarantee the next Bachelor will come out of this season, and it's very rare we have so many good choices. When you look at the front row of "Men Tell All," we had Ben Z, Ben H, Jared and Chris, and I was looking at those four thinking any of them would make a great season. We've started those discussions and we'll have a great Bachelor.
Shawn and Kaitlyn's golf date reminded me of what their relationship was like before all the Nick drama.
Harrison: Yeah, it was nice to see the spark that is Shawn and Kaitlyn.
The Bachelorette: Why Kaitlyn didn't keep Sex with Nick a secret from the guys
And we finally see that the naked guy from the super tease is... Shawn!
Harrison: Yep, they bared it all and it was hysterical.
I like that we now get to see the "morning after" the fantasy suite dates. Is this a new thing? Harrison: It's something we're trying to show fans a little bit more. We've never shown it before, but I think it shows a softer, sweeter side to these relationships where you feel like you're looking in on this moment.
What did you think when Nick confronted Shawn after theirs date?
Harrison: They were done with each other before the fantasy suite, so you can only imagine now. It'll be interesting what we do at "After the Final Rose" because we've never had such a contentious relationship between the final two. So, I want to get them on the stage together. They really dislike each other and that's never going to change, especially because one of them will end up with Kaitlyn and the other will be the loser. So, that'll only increase the animosity and who knows what will be said. AFR is going to be wild.
It was interesting to see how emotional Nick's mom was about their previous heartbreak.
Harrison: You kind of get the impression that they fall hard and they fall a lot. Not that they're not two worthy women, but they fell head over heels for Andi and now he's head over heels for Kaitlyn. So is that coincidence? I don't know, but their parents shed some light, and it maybe validates them a little more that you see it is genuine. For those who think he's here to be the next Bachelor or get their 15 minutes, I'm sure to some degree there is that, but you do see that [he falls in love] and this is who they are.
What did you think of both "meet the parents" dates overall?
Harrison: I'll say this: It was the least impactful meet the parents we've had. Nothing was riding on meeting the parents, and Kaitlyn isn't the type of person to be swayed by that. Andi was much more family-driven, and the fact that Josh's family was in Atlanta and their family loved Josh all very much played into the Andi-Josh scenario.
The Bachelorette's Kaitlyn had an email address dedicated to this Hanson brother
I don't think I had realized Shawn hadn't said "I love you" yet.
Harrison: I thought the same thing when I heard that, and I went back and realized that [this week] was the first time. Their relationship has been so tumultuous, volatile and emotional that you assume they were already there, which they were because it's one of those things where you don't need to say it.
The episode ended with them being extremely emotional. What's next?
Harrison: This is a train wreck the rest of the way. The good news is they narrowed it down to two guys they know she's in love with and has the best chance at making it with. But to that end, they probably would've done themselves [a favor] to bring someone to the Final 2 they knew wasn't the one because they created a huge situation. It's going to be beyond a normal breakup because one of them is not only getting dumped, but he'll be hurt and feel like the loser to the other guy. Kaitlyn knows she's really going to hurt someone on a grand scale.
What can you tease about next week's "Men Tell All"?
Harrison: It's going to be a phenomenal show. It wasn't a lot of catty stuff, but more dealing with questions, like why they only told Shawn [about having sex]. We talked more to Ben, who was the only one privy to the conversation with Shawn when they said, "You're the one," and they really exposed that whole night and what happened, which was very enlightening. And Ian will surprise people.
The Bachelorette airs on Mondays at 8/7c on ABC.

About
Designing for the environment is a key Übertüb company value. Every step of the manufacturing process has been designed to have a minimal impact on the environment. We even offer a replacement warranty …so if you ever find a way to destroy your Übertüb , we'll take it back, and reprocess the rubber to produce new products. We are always thinking of ways to leave things a little better than we found them. And that means re-thinking how we build our product so that we remove waste from the equation.
Supporting American innovation, design, and manufacturing is a key business objective. We want to help domestic companies provide good quality jobs and opportunities for people. Built in USA means quality you can depend on and Übertüb is committed to, wherever possible , engaging onshore suppliers for all product and packaging components.
Make your Übertüb your very own. With a variety of instant-stick rubber patches in a variety of shapes, colors, and sizes, your tube will be one-of-a-kind . And while we have every confidence in our product's durability, if you do somehow manage to spring a leak, simply fix it. Why throw away what can easily be made new again?
Why pack away your Übertüb when it gets cold outside? Many of us remember hurtling ourselves down the snow-covered hills , bouncing harmlessly off jumps and bumps. Get your kids (young and old) outside in the winter and enjoy some healthy outdoor play.
The old carbon-black tubes were pretty darn good, but they looked a bit drab . Not anymore! The Übertüb is available in several colors of rubber in addition to the classic black model. We've worked with leading rubber compounding companies to produce a UV-stable, durable, and safe recreation-specific colored material. Now you can have it both ways– real rubber and your favorite color , too.
Government regulations for phthalates , and other nasty chemicals often found in many PVC toys/inflatables, are being banned around the world, especially in the toy industry. The rubber used to build the Übertüb is completely inert , and won't leach anything into the environment or cause any health issues. Designing for both people and the environment is a key part of our philosophy.
At long last – a tube with a valve that doesn't jab you while you're swimming or sliding down a snow-covered hill. The entire valve assembly is flush and contoured with the inside surface of the Übertüb . And it looks really slick to boot. What's not to love?
Constructed using industrial-strength butyl rubber, your Übertüb is ready for just about any punishment that you or your kids can dish out. We've tried all kinds of ways to destroy it (check out our YouTube Channel ) and the Übertüb just keeps coming back for more abuse. Every part of the product is designed and crafted with quality in mind. These are built to last –just like the old days.
With no trapped air inside, your Übertüb easily slides into the included quick-dry mesh bag and it's ready for next time. Its small packed size makes it a breeze to toss into a suitcase, load in a trunk, or stow it wherever you want. Storing and transporting your Übertüb just became a whole lot more convenient and requires less space.
You will never again have to struggle to deflate your tube. Just unscrew the valve assembly and all the air rushes out, allowing you to quickly roll up your Übertüb , or fold it flat . A 42” tube deflates in mere seconds so you'll be off and ready to go. Your old inner tube sure didn't do that!
We've designed a valve system that allows you to use just about whatever you have on hand to inflate your tube. A gas station air pump, your portable air compressor, a foot/hand pump, or even our easy-to-use manual inflation tool will quickly do the trick. A check valve keeps all the air inside your Übertüb while you screw on the convenient cap that locks all the parts in place.
And for the first time ever , you can have a rubber Übertüb in color ! We've worked with leading engineers to develop a durable colored rubber. This brings a whole new level of awesomeness and fun to the Übertüb !
And so, we bring you the Übertüb (pronounced Ubertube ). It's the classic rubber inner tube - reinvented, re-engineered, and re-designed for you and your family. Our patent-pending, recessed valve system makes rapid inflation and deflation a snap. Take it anywhere and pack it up with ease in the quick-dry mesh storage sack! It's extremely durable , so you'll never have to worry about it bursting or the seams coming apart.
Rubber Inner tubes. As kids, we loved them. We spent hours playing with them. But where are they now? They've all but disappeared, and no one has looked to improve upon them. Today's cheap, plastic inflatables have replaced the classic rubber tube, but with limited success. Vinyl/PVC plastic tubes lack durability, are hard to inflate , and seldom last more than a few hours before they burst. Most are very toxic , are a huge waste of money, and continue to pile up in our landfills.

Risks and challenges
We have worked very hard to line up quality manufacturers and suppliers to build the Übertüb. But bringing even the simplest of products to market is not without its challenges. We've gone to great lengths to anticipate any potential hiccups with the design and development of the Übertüb, and we are committed to resolving every challenge that comes our way.
ENGINEERING
The key to our product is the development of a valve system that works with the most commonly available inflation methods and tools, such as air compressors, gas station air pumps, 12 volt tire inflator pumps, hand or foot air mattress pumps and more. However, with the purchase of your Übertüb, we will include a manual inflation tool that is form-fitted for easy and efficient inflation by mouth. As such, there is no need to have a pump or compressor to inflate an Übertüb quickly.
In designing and patenting a custom recessed valve system, we have also considered compatibility with existing manufacturing processes. Our valve is comprised of four components: a cup, a Boston valve adapter, a Schrader adapter, and a cap that encapsulates the entire assembly. A rubber gasket at the base of the cup meets with the cap to ensure an airtight seal. The Schrader adaptor is not an actual valve, as our research has indicated that dirt or sand can cause a Schrader valve to malfunction or jam. The Schrader adapter slides into the Boston valve beneath it with a simple friction fit. The Boston valve component is the primary check valve enabling convenient and rapid inflation with no loss of air. When removed, a ⅞” hole in the base of the recessed valve cup permits extremely rapid deflation.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The entire valve stack assembly is protected under a provisional utility patent application, which is accompanied by a provisional industrial design patent to protect unique and distinctive aesthetic product features. Protecting all intellectual property developed during the design and development of the Übertüb is an important step in bringing this product to market.
MANUFACTURING
Our company has already engaged a leading US-based rubber inner tube manufacturer to adapt current production equipment and procedures to accommodate our new valve and our aesthetic requirements. Utilizing existing equipment will enable us to bring the Übertüb to market more quickly and at a much lower cost. We will be leveraging the expertise of people who have many decades of experience building quality rubber inner tubes for a variety of applications.
We have also negotiated secondary arrangements with overseas manufacturing facilities. Though our preference is to build the product in the USA, having access to other manufacturing partners if needed will provide us with additional flexibility and scalability should product demand require it.
DISTRIBUTION
Though managing a supply chain can sometimes present challenges, we are actively building a team of quality suppliers (and back-up suppliers) who are committed to delivering quality products on time, and at a fair price. We will look to work with the manufacturer's existing logistics capabilities for skid distribution to North American fulfillment warehouses.
We have engaged a reputable fulfillment provider to deliver product and swag to our pledge supporters. They are a very capable part of our team, prepared to support both small and large-scale fulfillment. We believe in surrounding ourselves with experienced, industry-specific professionals who will help assist us in bringing the Übertüb to market quickly and efficiently.
COST OF GOODS
Our goal is to build a great product right here in North America while maintaining a fair retail price. That's no small feat, as it's often cheaper to source or manufacture products overseas. Übertüb is committed to supporting businesses here at home. Although we remain committed to this objective, we have connected with overseas producers in case domestic production becomes cost-prohibitive. We are committed to bringing the Übertüb to market.
RUBBER COMPOUNDING
We have several compounding companies ready to conduct research and development on a custom rubber compound that can be colored. And although we have a number of colors planned for the Übertüb, as we finalize our rubber compounding, the pigmentation and vulcanization process may produce a somewhat different palette than we anticipate. We will continue to work closely with our compounding suppliers throughout the development of the product to ensure we build a durable material in a series of attractive colors, that is safe for consumers and easy on the environment.
BRANDING
As vital to the product as the unique valve system and the special colored rubber, is the Übertüb brand itself. We've done a great deal of legwork to ensure that this is a brand that people will love and seek out. Our wordmark and logo have been professionally hand-lettered. Our branding system has been laid out by a graphic designer/typographer with a prescriptive style guide.
Our name has also been protected with our own top-level domain (ubertub.com), matching vanity URLs on all social channels, and a customer service number (844-UBERTUB). We've even gone as far as to file a US Trademark application for the wordmark and graphical equivalents. We are aware of the importance of brand recognition in the marketplace.
PACKAGE DESIGN
We've collaborated with an award-winning corrugate packaging firm. They have helped us design a unique box in which to ship and retail the product. The design maximizes pallet space to achieve optimum shipping efficiencies. Printing colors have been reduced to address costs and an innovative PET plastic lid has been designed so that the product color can be easily seen on the shelf. We plan to use Post-Consumer Waste (PCW) paper and vegetable-based inks for printing. Arrangements are in place to ship all materials to the manufacturer for packaging and shipment. The packaging has been designed with the environment in mind, as it is easy to disassemble and recycle each of the component parts.
REGULATORY
The Übertüb is designed specifically for recreation, so special attention will be paid to government product safety requirements. Our rubber compounding partners will assist us with the development of a material that is inert - with no ill health effects to either people or the environment. And our legal team will help us to be sure that we've adhered to any and all applicable safety laws wherever the product is sold. Who knew there'd be so much fine print involved with re-inventing the inner tube?
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Part of our product will involve the creation of a charitable foundation focused on helping to get kids and their families outside and active. The Übertüb idea stems largely from our belief that people spend too much time in front of their computers, tablets, or phones. By encouraging good clean fun with a quality toy that stimulates the imagination, we believe that we can improve the quality of people's lives and help to make them happier and healthier.
PRODUCT COMMUNITY
In order to help further encourage people to go outside and have fun with our products, we plan to create a community of Übertübrs. These will be product evangelists who willingly share photos, videos, locations, and experiences with other tubing enthusiasts. The idea is to help raise awareness of both our products and how simple toys like the Übertüb can help people stay active and healthy.
OUR COMMITMENT
To sum up, we've already made tremendous progress toward bringing this great product to market. We've absorbed the costs that we've needed to in order to get this far, but to truly put the gears into motion, we need the support of the Kickstarter community. There remains a large amount of legal work, research, product development, injection mold production, marketing, web development, patent work, accounting, and other related tasks that will all incur significant costs. Thank you for your support and know that we are fully committed to making this fantastic product a reality!

Washington (CNN) Some members of Congress reacted to news reports of Anthony Scaramucci's departure from the role of White House communications director with celebration on Monday.
But lawmakers seemed to have more mixed feelings on whether the news should be seen as a sign of a White House in chaos or as an indication that new chief of staff John Kelly has restored order.
"'No WH chaos!'" Democrat Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia wrote in a tweet , mock quoting a tweet from President Donald Trump earlier in the day before the news broke.
Democrat Rep. Dina Titus of Nevada made a similar point, minus the sarcasm, in their response on Twitter
"The chaos coming out of this @WhiteHouse is disturbing," they said. "The world is watching."
"Chaos continues to flow from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue," Democrat Rep. Marc Veasey of Texas wrote in a tweet
"More chaos," Democrat Rep. Yvette Clarke of New York said in a tweet
But Republican Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina said the takeaway from this shakeup should be that "we call an ace," referring to Kelly's reported role in Scaramucci's departure.
"Thank goodness for General John Kelly," they wrote in a Facebook post . "I haven't been looking for ways to be critical of the president, but when things are crazy and not working, it's vital that we call an ace. ... Whether you're a Republican and actively supporting the president or a regular citizen who simply knows that what goes wrong in Washington can have real effect to your life, Scaramucci's actions were hurting all of us."
Democrat Sen. Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut told CNN, "It's a clear sign that Gen. Kelly is bringing decisive discipline to a WH sorely in need of that kind of law and order."
"They're dropping like flies," Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana told CNN. "I have a lot of respect for Gen. Kelly. I hope they can get things together over there."
Democrat Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut said on the "Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer":"Kelly in and Scaramucci out is nothing but good for the White House and for the country."
"John Kelly, a Marine, well-respected," they said: "If anyone can bring order to what has been a chaotic White House operation, I would expect it would be a four-star Marine."
Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri told CNN that Kelly coming in is a "good thing" and that they hope they can bring "order to the White House."
"I think they have the skill set and the background to do that, and respect in the White House probably personnel-wide to get that done."
These comments partially echo the White House's messaging. Deputy Assistant to the President Sebastian Gorka said in a interview with Phoenix radio station KTAR News shortly after Kelly was sworn in this morning that the "The White House will function like a well-oiled Marine unit."
Two Democratic members of congress who have cosponsored an article of impeachment against Trump used the opportunity to encourage their colleagues to oust the President himself.
"Firing the King's Men is not the solution when the King is the problem. Another firing closer to impeachment. #RepealAndReplaceTrump," Democrat Rep. Al Green of Texas tweeted
"#Trump fires Scaramucci after 10 days on the job. What took so long? And how long will it take to get #impeachment hearings in the House?" Democrat Rep. Brad Sherman of California said in a tweet
Ranking member of the House intelligence committee Adam Schiff seemed to jokingly thank Scaramucci for their service.
"Thank you Anthony @Scaramucci for your service. I speak for a grateful nation when I say 'has it really only been 11 days?!?'" they said in a tweet
Democrat Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii joked in a tweet that they are "legitimately exhausted from the winning," a reference to Trump saying on the campaign trail that they planned to win so much that "you'll be tired of winning."
Other Democratic members of Congress just wanted to express their astonishment.
"Speechless," Democrat Rep. Ed Perlmutter of Colorado wrote in tweet
"I'm surprised The Mooch is already gone. I thought he'd last at least a few more episodes on this reality show," Democrat Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania wrote in a tweet
After my post on the actual wrestling accomplishments of Jon Jones and Chael Sonnen, I decided to make this sort of thing a regular feature. My colleague K.J. Gould suggested Factgrinder as the name for these posts, I found the suggestion to have a nice ring, and here we are.
I've said before that I gravitated towards MMA largely due to the presence of my favorite amateur wrestlers. I then fell into writing about MMA in part because of MMA writers' and commentators' lack of any clear ability to place the amateur wrestling resumes of fighters into proper perspective. The breaking point was when Joe Rogan commented in 2007 that Matt Grice's 4 Oklahoma high school state wrestling championships were worth 6 California state championships. This demonstrated to me utter ignorance as to the relative importance of different amateur wrestling accomplishments. Now my Factgrinder is here to set the record straight on the exact meaning of a fighter's wrestling resume.
I should lay out a few guidelines about this feature before I discuss Cain Velasquez's amateur wrestling accomplishments.
This is not meant to be a predictive tool. I am aware of the difference between the effectiveness of wrestling on a mat, and its effectiveness as applied in a cage. Still, it is important to get a handle on the actual meaning of wrestling accomplishments to gain perspective on the qualifications of the athletes in MMA, as well as to eventually determine how faithfully wrestling pedigree manifests itself in a combat athlete once they become a MMA fighter.
I'm not going to spend much time discussing high school accomplishments.
The highest possible wrestling pedigrees are earned in the Olympic wrestling styles of Greco-Roman and freestyle on the senior level (senior in this case meaning there are no age restrictions). Achievements in these styles and grouping in the U.S. Open, world/Olympic team trials, world championships/Olympic games and various international tournaments hold greater weight than collegiate accomplishments. If a wrestler does well enough on this level, they earn the right to be called "world class". I attempted to establish a baseline for what constitutes a world class wrestler in my very first post on BE
Below senior level accomplishments are collegiate accolades. Among the various collegiate groupings, NCAA Division 1 serves as the gold standard. If a wrestler has competed in a lower division, then their success can only be properly understood by relating it to success on the Division 1 level.
Without further ado, let's grind the facts on Cain Velasquez-
I observed a decent level of shock from MMA fans regarding the degree to which Cain Velasquez out-wrestled Brock Lesnar when they fought each other. Looking back on their competitive wrestling resumes, it's clear this shock was misplaced. The keen observer could make a somewhat compelling case that Cain had a superior amateur wrestling career.
Cain was definitely a better pound-for-pound wrestler than Lesnar, and they were certainly more decorated in both of the Olympic styles, where they preformed very well on the age-group level and even on the senior level. Both were junior college national champs, and while Brock did more on the Division 1 level, Cain was in the Division 1 semi-finals twice - just as many times as Lesnar. In both of Cain's semi-final appearances, they lost in competitive matches to Cole Konrad , whom I believe was a superior wrestler to Brock. Furthermore, I've heard more than a few claim that if stalling were more aggressively enforced by the referee, Cain would have beaten Konrad in the 2006 semis. This would have been Cain's second win over Konrad, whom they beat in a 2004 dual meet. Cain was also consistent, as a senior, their only loses were to the three heavyweights who placed in front of them at nationals - three very good heavies in Steve Mocco of Oklahoma State, Cole Konrad of Minnesota and Greg Wagner of Michigan (Thanks to my friends as D1CollegeWrestling.net for some research help there).
Velasquez's collegiate career started at Iowa Central Community College, a junior college wrestling power. While there, they won an NJCAA national championship, just like current UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones, who later wrestled for ICCC as well. For the most part, high level wrestlers like Cain wind up wrestling at JUCOs for one of two reasons: either they wrestled in an obscure high school program and didn't get attention from big NCAA programs, or they had grade issues to work out. I don't think exposure was a problem for Cain. While their two high school state championships in Arizona wouldn't garner them national attention on their own (Arizona produces occasional top level wrestlers like Henry Cejudo and Anthony Robles, but it is pretty far from an elite wrestling state), Cain twice placed in both freestyle and Greco at the USA Wrestling Junior National Championships in Fargo. These placings alone would have put them on the radar of top Division 1 programs as a big time recruit.
My guess is that Cain went to ICCC to shore up some academic issues. Unfortunately, when they returned to Arizona to wrestle for Arizona State as a sophomore, they continued to have some classroom struggles. They were declared ineligible for the 2004 post season in what was, up until that point, a very promising debut season on the Division 1 level.
Cain managed to turn things around. Their final two years of eligibility saw stellar post-seasons with Pac-10 championships, and All-American finishes at the NCAA tournament (All-American meaning a top 8 finish at the national championship), placing 5th and then 4th at the 2005 and 2006 national championships respectively.
In my retrospective on Chael Sonnen's wrestling career, I mentioned how all NCAA All Americans aren't equal. In all of Chael Sonnen's appearances at the NCAA tournament, they placed eighth once - and in the process, Chael beat one wrestler who would go on to themselves be an American. In Cain's two NCAA appearances they beat four different wrestlers who would themselves achieve All American status, and placed in front of twelve.
Cain had a great scholastic career and they hold claim to some fairly robust achievements in the Olympic styles.
In 2002, Cain was a FILA junior national champ in freestyle, and qualified for the junior (20 and under) world team. The USA doesn't always perform that well at the junior world championship, but our junior world teams consist largely of wrestlers who go on to accomplish great things in wrestling. The only other junior world team members currently in MMA who come to mind are Bubba Jenkins (gold at junior worlds) and Mark Munoz (silver at junior worlds); both won Division 1 championships after their time on the junior world team. Some regard the junior world championship as the second most prestigious wrestling championship in the world behind the senior world championships or Olympics. Unfortunately for Cain, they didn't get to compete at junior worlds. From 2001-2005 FILA capriciously followed a policy of only holding junior worlds biennially and 2002 was an off-year.
Cain's 2002 FILA junior freestyle championship was accompanied by a third place finish in the FILA junior Greco national championship. Considering the fact that prior to researching for this post, I had no recollection that Cain had any Greco accomplishments, this result served as a bit of a surprise. Apparently, in high school and their first two collegiate years, Cain was one of the country's best Greco heavyweights in their age group. They were also very close to winning a double FILA junior national championship (both freestyle and Greco), which is a pretty gaudy feat.
Velasquez notched a 7th place finish at university nationals in freestyle, which was also in 2002. Seeing as how Cain was only 19 at the time, and most their competitors were significantly older, this was a notable result.
This provides reasonable segue to launch into a brief discussion of the significance of university-level achievements. These pop up from time to time in a fighter's background, and seem to lead to some misunderstandings.
The university age group, I suppose, was created by FILA with the intention of providing a world championship for students. This doesn't make too much sense as most of the champions at the senior world championships have "student" listed as their occupation. Instead, the university world championships operate as sort of grouping for wrestlers who are good, but not on track to ever be their country's very best. A University world championship functions sort of like the WWE's intercontinental championship - it's a nice thing to win, but a long way from the top.
Domestically, university nationals is certainly a tough tournament and place winners are almost always good Division 1 wrestlers. That said, an All American finish at university nationals does not hold nearly the same gravity as as Division 1 All American status. When MMA fighters list "university All American" as an accomplishment it often confuses the non-wrestling initiated in the media and elsewhere, who see "university" and assume it means "NCAA". I saw a prominent MMA writer erroneously describe Chael Sonnen as a two time NCAA Greco champion. Chael was a two time university champion. They couldn't have won an NCAA Greco championship as Greco-Roman wrestling is not an NCAA sanctioned sport.
Returning to a discussion of Cain Velasquez, their greatest Olympic style accomplishment was a 5th place finish in the 2003 senior US national championship in freestyle. Senior nationals (more widely referred to as "The Open") is a tournament where you will fairly regularly see NCAA champions fail to place. Making this performance particularly impressive was Cain's age.
This 2003 senior nationals tournament occurred before Cain's 21st birthday. Rarely do heavies this young place so high at national tournaments on the senior level. Unfortunately, this would be the last time Cain would place in a senior national championship; subsequent appearances failed to yield comparable results.
The Factgrinder Final Analysis
In the grand scheme of things, how good a wrestler was Cain Velasquez? In college they were one of the very best in a very good crop of heavyweights, they just couldn't quite make it to the top. Had Cain made serious Olympic runs in 2008 and 2012, the story probably would have been the same. I figure that if Cain Velasquez fully committed themselves to freestyle wrestling they would probably have placed in the 4th or 6th range at the Olympics trials, just a tier down from the top guys.
The Factgrinder final analysis has determined that while Cain Velasquez was not the greatest that amateur wrestling had to offer, they were pretty damn close and a good bit closer than most would realize.
Story highlights Zimmerman's lawyer explains the "code" and admits it credibility implications
The lawyer adds the calls have "so little to do with what counts in the case"
Zimmerman and their wife both claimed they were indigent at a bond hearing in April
Jailhouse phone calls released Monday show the two discussing their money
Despite telling the court they were indigent, George Zimmerman and their wife discussed -- in code, according to prosecutors -- money raised online to help in their defense on second-degree murder charges, jailhouse phone calls released Monday show.
Prosecutors had claimed the Zimmermans lied about their financial means before a Florida judge set their bond, which the suspect then posted to get out of jail. Zimmerman, accused in the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, is now back behind bars after the judge revoked their bail, citing the misrepresentations.
Six calls made public Monday, out of about 151 total that Zimmerman made while incarcerated, appear to back up the prosecutor's assertions.
At their husband's April 20 bond hearing, Shellie Zimmerman testified they didn't know how much had been raised through the website their husband had set up before charges being filed.

And when asked whether the couple had money available to assist in their defense, they replied, "Um, not -- not that I'm aware of."
In one jailhouse phone conversation, Zimmerman asks their wife, "In my account, do I have at least $100?" They answer no, then tells them they have more like "$8, $8.60."
"So total everything, how much are we looking at?" Zimmerman asks their wife.
"Like $155," they respond.
Prosecutors claim the husband and wife were speaking in a type of code about their available funds, an assertion Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara says the defense has "never contested."
"There's no question that they were talking in this sort of simplistic kind of code, where they were talking about $155 when, without question, they were talking about $155,000," O'Mara told CNN's Piers Morgan on Monday night.
In another call, Zimmerman asks their wife to "pay off all the bills," including Sam's Club and American Express bills, prosecutors said.
The couple also discusses how much money can be accessed and what to do with it, including transferring funds that were raised online for their defense to accounts belonging to Zimmerman's sister and wife, prosecutors state in a probable cause affidavit.
Records released Monday show that tens of thousands of dollars were transferred out of a bank account. Prosecutors allege a total of $47,000 was transferred from George Zimmerman's account to their sister's account from April 16 and 17, and that Shellie Zimmerman transferred more than $74,000 from their husband's account to their account between April 16 and April 19.
After George Zimmerman was released on bond this spring, their wife transferred more than $85,500 from their account back to their account, according to the affidavit.
Prosecutors allege the couple actually had about $135,000 of donations at their disposal when they both told the court, under oath, they were indigent.

O'Mara, Zimmerman's lawyer, later said their client ended up netting a total of $204,000 via PayPal accounts -- about $150,000 of which is now in an independently managed trust after $30,000 was used to pay for "life in hiding" and $20,000 has been kept liquid.
On June 1, Seminole County Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester Jr. agreed with the prosecution that the Zimmermans were dishonest about their financial status and, after revoking George Zimmerman's bond, ordered that they return to jail. They remain behind bars and has a second bond hearing set for June 29.
On June 12, Shellie Zimmerman was arrested on a perjury charge , accused of lying at their husband's bond hearing about the couple's finances. They were released later that day after meeting the conditions of a $1,000 bond, the Seminole County Sheriff's Office said.
The defense team on Monday filed a motion asking a judge to reconsider the release of a witness statement and to clarify a previous ruling on the release of additional jail phone calls. Both issues will be addressed during next week's bond hearing.
It all ties into the larger case against Zimmerman, who prosecutors say ignored a police dispatcher's instruction and pursued Martin as they were walking in a Sanford, Florida, gated community last winter and shot the unarmed teenager. The 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer, meanwhile, has insisted they shot Martin in self-defense.
Independent attorneys told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell the jailhouse recordings should be relevant in the case -- both as the judge weighs how high to set Zimmerman's bail and, once the trial begins, potentially affecting jurors' assessment as to whether their account of what happened February 26 can be trusted. While investigators talked to several neighbors and others, no one saw the shooting directly except for Zimmerman and the now-deceased Martin.
"His credibility is everything. Why would they risk it on something that is so trivial as this?" Georgia-based lawyer Pilar Prinz said of the Zimmermans' jailhouse discussions about their money. " I can't understand it."
O'Mara acknowledged the Zimmermans inflicted a "great blow to their credibility," making it clear the two had available funds and were not honest about it -- something that might prompt Judge Lester to order the defendant to stay in jail until the trial because they feel "he can no longer trust him."
But the lawyer said, in the 30 hours of calls between the couple, there's no indication the Zimmermans intended to deceive the judge, and also pointed out that their client came clean to them four days later. O'Mara also said the couple was stressed, fearful and distrustful at the time.
"I only hope that ... critics give it a more global perspective -- which is what (Zimmerman) was going through and what their family was going through as to why they may not have been completely honest about the money ... and sort of what they were facing," they said.
Lastly, O'Mara stressed that the questions about their finances are distinct from what happened the night of the shooting.
"It truly has so little to do with what counts in the case, which is what happened when Trayvon Martin passed away," they said.
Besides the conversations about finances, the newly released phone calls shed light on the relationship between George and Shellie Zimmerman. In one exchange, they talk optimistically about their future together.
"After this, ... you're going to be able to just have a great life," Shellie Zimmerman said.
"We will," replies their husband.
The two also talk about the support Zimmerman has received from the public, in the wake of the controversy that followed the Martin shooting.
"You're special and (an) amazing role model to people, honey," their wife said.
"Hmm, I wish, I wish I were," Zimmerman said.
Former LSU football standouts Tyrann Mathieu and Jordan Jefferson were among four ex-players arrested Thursday after police found them with marijuana at Mathieu's apartment, police said.

Lt. Don Kelly, a Baton Rouge Police spokesperson, said officers were called to the apartment complex about 3:30 p.m. after receiving a complaint about a man forcing their way through the security gate before going to Mathieu's apartment.
”Officers immediately smelled a strong odor of marijuana and obtained consent from Mathieu to search the apartment,” Kelly said.
Inside they found Jefferson and two other men – Karnell Hatcher and Derrick Bryant – as well as a marijuana grinder, digital scale and 10 bags of high-grade marijuana. Kelly said seven of the bags were found inside Bryant's book bag.
Mathieu, 20, of New Orleans, and Jefferson, 22, of St. Rose, La., were booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison on charges of simple possession of marijuana. Hatcher, 22, of Delray Beach, Fla., was booked with second-offense simple possession of marijuana and Bryant, 22, of Lawrenceville, Ga., was booked with possession with intent to distribute marijuana.
Mathieu, a former Heisman Trophy finalist and cornerback known as the ”Honey Badger,” has no criminal record but has well documented drug problems that led to their dismissal from the Tigers in August. They had enrolled as a student at the school following two weeks of rehab under the care of former NBA player John Lucas. They also had talked about possibly returning to the team for the 2013 season with two seasons of eligibility.  They are also eligible to apply for the NFL draft in April.
Jefferson, the Tigers' former starting quarterback, had returned to Baton Rouge to finish their degree after playing with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League. They also are a free agent signee with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before joining the Alouettes.
Jefferson had been suspended for the start of their senior season in connection with a preseason bar fight near campus.
Lance Unglesby, Jefferson's lawyer in the misdemeanor criminal case, said a discovery hearing in that matter is scheduled next week. They said their client has always maintained their innocence in the bar fight.
”My opinion that Jordan is a fine young man remains the same,” Unglesby said.
Unglesby said they had not yet been provided with any details of Jefferson's latest arrest, but stressed, ”All individuals are presumed innocent and I look forward to the opportunity to examine the facts of this case to find out what really happened.”
It was not immediately known whether Mathieu, Hatcher or Bryant had lawyers.
A spokesperson for the university did not immediately respond to messages left by telephone and email.
Hatcher was a linebacker for the Tigers and finished with 133 career tackles, 3.5 for a loss and two forced fumbles.
Bryant, a backup safety, finished with 28 tackles, 2.0 for a loss and one sack.
Dels.-elect Danica Roem (D-Prince William) and Chris Hurst (D-Blacksburg) say they will push for stronger open-records laws in Virginia. (From left to right: Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post; Jay Westcott/For The Washington Post/From left to right: Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post; Jay Westcott/For The Washington Post)
An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the business executive at the center of a federal corruption case involving former Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell. That executive was Jonnie R. Williams Sr., not Jonnie R. Williams Jr. This version has been corrected.
Getting public records can be challenging in Virginia, where the state attorney general's office once charged nearly $15,000 for the release of emails related to then-Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli's (R) ties to a well-connected business person.
But 2018 may be a year for greater transparency, with two journalists entering the House of Delegates determined to revise Virginia's Freedom of Information Act and Fairfax County — the state's largest jurisdiction — launching a policy officials say will make it easier for the public to get public records.
Dels.-elect Danica Roem (D-Prince William) and Chris Hurst (D-Blacksburg) say they know all about being blocked from getting records in Virginia.
Virginia's 49-year-old statute is considered among the most restrictive in the country, with about 150 exemptions barring the release of certain information, which often result in heavily redacted documents. Advocates say the rules and the high prices agencies charge to produce documents that can be made public hamper journalists, community activists and ordinary citizens who seek information on topics that range from police investigations to safety inspections and local school test scores.
"It's gotten to the point where I generally don't even bother filing a FOIA request," said Robert B. Weir, who chairs the planning commission in the town of Haymarket and, in 2016, was denied Prince William County records related to a new computer data center until they initiated a lawsuit. "It's not worth the frustration or the expense."
Roem, a former newspaper reporter in Prince William County, is preparing a bill that, among other things, would waive any fee for FOIA requests that take less than two hours to process.
They also want to create an ombudsman position to facilitate requests made to state agencies — modeled after a 2015 Maryland law that seeks to weed out excessive FOIA requests and expedite those that are on topic. The Maryland law has received mixed reviews from journalists and residents of the state.
"That is the goal here," Roem said. "To improve government accountability and to allow the people to have access to their documents."
Virginia's FOIA fees stirred controversy in 2013 when the state attorney general's office charged state Sen. A. Donald McEachin (D) nearly $15,000 to begin a search for emails linking Cuccinelli to Jonnie R. Williams Sr., the business executive at the center of a federal corruption case involving Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R). McEachin, now a Virginia member of congress, unsuccessfully sued the state for the information.
Outgoing Del. James M. LeMunyon (R-Chantilly), who chaired an advisory council on FOIA issues, said the General Assembly has revised the FOIA law in some ways — requiring government agencies to hire FOIA officers to facilitate requests and post meeting notices on their websites, for example — and has grappled with questions of cost.
"The government doesn't want someone to come in with a huge request and then the taxpayers will lose a lot of money because someone wants to see something," LeMunyon said.
Other looming issues include how to treat text messages sent by public officials during public meetings and comments posted on their personal Facebook pages, they added.
Open-records advocates seek more wholesale changes, possibly including stiffer penalties for officials who violate FOIA laws. Washington state assesses a fee of $100 per day for each document improperly withheld from public view. Fines in Virginia can climb as high as $5,000, but violations are harder to prove, advocates say.
Megan Rhyne, director of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, said they have a "wish list" for Virginia's law that includes allowing residents in other states access to public records and, as in North Carolina, making transcripts of closed-session meetings available after a decision is made.
In Fairfax, Benjamin Tribbett, a former chief of staff to Supervisor Kathy Smith (D-Chantilly), said a county attorney once told new employees during a training session to regularly delete emails and explained how communications that include the county attorney's office fall under attorney-client privilege and would not be subject to disclosure.
"To emphasize to people that you can delete an email and that if it's not on your hard drive, it's not FOIA-able basically speaks volumes of what the intent of that training is," said Tribbett, a political consultant for Democrats who stopped working for the county earlier this year.
Fairfax officials disputed Tribbett's account, saying employees are only instructed to delete personal emails and that employees undergo training that details which documents must be released.
"Fairfax County does not advise employees at orientation or any other time to delete emails to avoid FOIA," county spokesperson Tony Castrilli said in a statement. "Transparency and accountability to the community are our top priorities and part of the culture in Fairfax County."
The county is streamlining its approach to the roughly 6,000 FOIA requests its 50 agencies receive every year. It will track pending requests to monitor for compliance, use technology that makes email searches easier and regularly remind agency directors they have the discretion to release some information the law considers to be exempt.
Rhyne said she's happy to see the FOIA process getting more attention. But they said there could be resistance in the state legislature from some lawmakers because the overhaul effort is spearheaded by current or former journalists.
Besides Roem and Hurst — a former television news anchor in Roanoke who plans to introduce a bill that would prevent marketing companies from receiving college students' cellphone numbers — Del. Mark Levine (D-Alexandria), a radio journalist, co-founded a General Assembly "transparency caucus" in 2016 that also advocates strengthening FOIA.
"My job will be to remind the General Assembly members of all stripes that FOIA is a citizens' law," Rhine said. "It's not just a press law, as some often think."
Despite continuing doubts over Brendan Rodgers' future, it seems the Liverpool boss and their colleagues on the much-maligned transfer committee are adopting a "business as usual" approach until they are told differently.
Rodgers has a strong ally in Mike Gordon, FSG's man on Merseyside (and part of said transfer committee), so unless the powers that be in Boston intervene, it appears the Northern Irishman is going nowhere.
Rodgers wants to revamp their squad after a desperately disappointing season and it's been widely reported that deals for out-of-contract duo James Milner and Danny Ings are expected to go through soon, while Divock Origi will finally arrive on Merseyside after a year on loan at Lille.
Reports also claim Rodgers is looking to raid Southampton once again and has had an approach for right-back Nathaniel Clyne rebuffed by the south coast club. The most high-profile and expensive target of the summer, though, looks to be Aston Villa centre-forward Christian Benteke.
The Belgian's scoring record over recent years compares favourably with many of the top strikers in the major European leagues, and he's certainly been a thorn in Liverpool's side. To average a goal every two games for a Villa team that has struggled is impressive. He's the main man for their national side too, which speaks volumes for Benteke's standing in Belgium considering the talent they have. So their quality and ability to score goals aren't really in question. Their suitability for Liverpool and Rodgers most certainly is, though.
Rodgers' brand of football looked great when Luis Suarez was leading the line, and it was relatively effective when Daniel Sturridge was up top in the Uruguayan's absence. When both were there it was often unstoppable, but this year neither were present and the goals completely dried up.
So is it unfair to say that Rodgers' way of playing can only work when they have a genuine superstar talent up front and players capable of creating their own chances as well as converting them?
The evidence certainly points to that conclusion. Rickie Lambert, Mario Balotelli and, to a lesser extent, Fabio Borini are all accomplished forwards who would command a place in most Premier League sides.
Not the top four, of course, but most of the others would be happy to have strikers of that calibre to call upon. In the right set-up they can be effective, yet Rodgers couldn't get anything out of any of them last year. Four Premier League goals between them is astonishingly poor.
By the end of the season, Rodgers was playing midfielders Adam Lallana and Philippe Coutinho up front because they were a better fit for how they wanted to play. Before that it was Raheem Sterling who was pushed into an unfamiliar centre-forward role to enable the team to play The Rodgers Way. There was not even a hint of altering their own methods to play to the strengths of the forwards they had, so why the interest in Benteke?
The Villa man is nothing like Sturridge and he's even less like Suarez, but you could say he's not too dissimilar in style to Lambert. Both are adept at holding the ball up and they like to get involved in the build-up play. Both thrive when they have pace and movement around them and when they have crosses to attack. Benteke is an upgrade on Lambert and he's certainly blessed with more pace, power and mobility, but they share more in common with the experienced Scouser than they do with any of Liverpool's other strikers in the recent past.
After such a disappointing season it's easy to forget just what accomplished players Lambert and Balotelli are. The Italian is a divisive figure and most Liverpool fans would not have chosen to sign them in the first place but even their biggest critic would not have expected them to contribute as little as they did.
For Rodgers to not have been able to get anything out of them this season is as much a damning indictment on their managerial ability as it is any failing on either Lambert or Balotelli's part. If they can't play the style you want to play and you don't have any better alternatives, then surely you adapt your style to get more out of the players you have?
Some will argue Balotelli's problems were due to a lack of commitment and being unwilling to adapt to what Rodgers wants. Even if that were the case it does not explain Lambert's struggles.  They are a model professional and lifelong Liverpool fan who would have done everything in their power to make the most of an opportunity they had waited their entire life for.
Daniel Sturridge and Mario Balotelli endured difficult seasons at Liverpool.
If Rodgers could get nothing from Lambert and Balotelli, why on earth would you allow them to spend £32.5million on Benteke? That's an awful lot of money to be gambling with when you're in Liverpool's precarious position. With every transfer window that passes without significant improvement to the squad, they will fall further and further away.
Liverpool has no identity. They appear to have a squad full of players who do not fit into any specific system, which is either the cause or a consequence of the manager constantly changing formations, not only on a week-to-week basis but also frequently three or four times during a single game.
How do they plan on using Benteke? If they use one striker then where do Ings, Origi and Sturridge fit into that? If it's two up front then what role do Coutinho, Lallana and the plethora of other attacking midfielders have? Benteke needs service from out wide, which Liverpool cannot offer with their current style or personnel.
Liverpool crosses the ball less than every other team in the Premier League. They also attempt more through balls than anybody else, which makes the targeting of Benteke puzzling. They could still be a useful asset, as they have more to their game than just getting on the end of crosses, but by taking that away from them you're reducing their effectiveness.
Of course it is possible that Rodgers is planning a complete revamp of the style they have thus far steadfastly refused to compromise on throughout their managerial career, but it seems unlikely.
A strong case can be made that Benteke is the best striker Liverpool could hope to attract this summer.
An equally strong case can be made that unless Rodgers is going to radically alter their philosophy, the Belgian will simply be another expensive square peg in a round hole.

Dark Christmas is very much Tim Burton's aesthetic.
So it's no surprise that when they were asked to direct the sequel to their massive hit, 1989's Batman, they would choose to go full-Burton. Burton enjoys the wintery aesthetic, displaying it in Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, and The Nightmare Before Christmas. Batman Returns is a full-on Christmas movie and makes absolutely no attempt to hide it. The WB logo is on a snowy background and every part of the movie — including the opening prologue of Penguin's birth and abandonment — takes place during the holiday season. Just watching the film makes you want to bundle up and light a fire.
Batman Returns is a very interesting, complicated and kind of muddled examination of its four leads. There's Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle/Catwoman, Danny DeVito as Oswald Cobblepot/The Penguin and Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. All four have intertwining goals, relationships and thematic parallels that make for interesting examination but sometimes leave our apparent lead, Batman, a little hard to stand out. The trick is that each of the villains opposite them are warped aspects of their own personality. They're what-could-have-beens if this Batman hadn't gone down the right path: a mentally unbalanced vigilante, a self-described “freak” and an immoral, unscrupulous business person.
Batman Returns pulls a little bit from various holiday standards when it comes to its storytelling. There's some It's a Wonderful Life in the mix (characters seeing how their lives could have been through the other characters), a tinge of the Ed Wood-esque Santa Claus Conquersy the Martians (specifically in some production design in the Batcave) and even a smattering of Biblical Epic (Penguin wanting to take and possibly kill the first-born children of Gotham's elite). But because of the interesting character dynamics there's one Christmas standard that slots into the movie really well. That's A Christmas Carol.
This version of the story, however, is different. Burton takes their love of German Expressionism, satirizing ‘80s excessiveness, and moralistic folk tales and throws them in a blender with A Christmas Carol. What comes out is a really amusing subplot about Scrooge not learning a damn thing from the Ghosts that visit them and dying horribly for their troubles.
Our Scrooge, in this instance, is Walken's Max Shreck. As good a choice as ever. He's seen for the first time in a boardroom (a la Bill Murray's character in the equally off-kilter Scrooged, directed by Superman: The Movie's Richard Donner) trying to bully the mayor into paying for Shreck to build an unnecessary power plant for Gotham City. The best part of the Batman films, and most of Burton's work, is the production design. The large office is full of glass and metal and varnished wood and black leather, an ode to ‘80s capitalist decadence, while Shreck themselves has a shock of white hair like Beethoven or Andrew Jackson. This timeless retro-futurism would live on in Batman: The Animated Series and gives a sense of heightened realism, allowing for a modern take on an old Christmas ghost story.
So we get to see Shreck being rude, greedy, misogynistic and casually violent. Which is perfect timing for our first Ghost to arrive. Shreck gets whisked away by a gang of former circus performers and meets the Penguin. For our purposes they stand in for the Ghost of Christmas Past. We even cut to the chase and have our Jacob Marley stand-in, Shreck's old business partner, Fred Atkins, appear right alongside Penguin. Well, some of him.
Lucky for Shreck this Ghost isn't an ethereal, fairy-like being. He's willing to make a deal. They don't care about having Shreck learn anything from their past, they want to put Shreck's criminal powers to use to help themselves out. They're both considered monsters but, as Penguin puts it, “somehow, you're a well-respected monster and I am . . . to-date . . . not”. Our Scrooge will take advantage of this weakness and, instead of maybe rethinking some life choices now that he's been kidnapped and brought down to a sewer, use it to further their own interests.
That leads us to our Ghost of Christmas Present who happens to also be our ostensible lead, Bruce Wayne. They and Shreck have a business meeting together where Wayne lets them know he's onto him, that the power plant mentioned in Shreck's first scene is actually some type of scheme. Wayne is the ideal of a do-gooder capitalist. They speak with local government, they commission reports and they try to stop those who are harming society. This is the first time he's a thorn in Shreck's side and they — through Batman especially — will continue to plague them throughout the film. A constant reminder of opposition to their brazen selfishness.
So once Shreck gets their first warning from the Ghost of Christmas Present they aren't put off by it. They don't exactly sweat the fact that people seem to despise him. They decide he'll just get rid of those people. So they spearhead a Mayoral campaign for the Penguin. He's very eerie as the man behind the curtain, pushing the Penguin — the newly minted Oswald Cobblepot — into the limelight to service each other's needs.
Shreck, through the Penguin and the gang of circus performers, cause mayhem in the city. Continuing their streak of not caring for the common folk. Instead of learning their lesson from the previous two Ghosts they go all-in. It all manages to catch up to them though when they meet the Ghost of Christmas Future.
It's important when discussing Batman Returns to set aside a moment to discuss Michelle Pfeiffer. Them performance as Selina Kyle and Catwoman is, in my opinion, the best performance in any superhero movie yet. They transition between playing a meek, mousy assistant with a morbid streak to a raging id. A personification of life and death. Pfeiffer practically steals every scene she's in, which is no small feat when you're acting against the likes of Danny DeVito and Christopher Walken. The romance scenes between them and Michael Keaton are off-the-charts exciting, it's not even fair to compare their charisma to Keaton and Kim Basinger in the original film. Keaton and Pfeiffer both hit the same note of unhinged tragedy that puts them on each other's wavelengths and no other Batman love interest, not Nicole Kidman or Maggie Gyllenhaal or Henry Cavill, has come close to matching it.
Catwoman, in this tale, plays the very important role of the Ghost of Christmas Future. The roles of Past and Future are blurred a bit between Penguin and Catwoman. Penguin does end up kidnapping Shreck and showing them the possible death of their son while Catwoman is Shreck's murder of Selina Kyle (a scene that plays like Scrooge deciding to throw Cratchit off the tallest building) coming back to haunt him. Generally though they fit into their respective places, especially the parts they play in Shreck's eventual comeuppance.
When Shreck finally meets the Ghost of Christmas Future she's wild-eyed and vengeful. There is no three-strikes policy with Catwoman. Shreck ignored the warning of meeting the Ghost of Future Past and ignored the warnings of the Ghost of Christmas Present and now they don't get a chance to change anything because deep down — and on the surface — Shreck doesn't want to. It is too late. No one's going to be able to buy a goose for them in the morning. Catwoman seems like an extremely anti-capitalist, anti-consumerist character in this film. They make their suit from scraps, they blow up department store and they don't give Scrooges second chances.
So this Christmas Carol ends with Scrooge dying from an industrial taser kiss.
It's a very, very different take on A Christmas Carol. It's also intriguing to watch and follow and pretty damn funny, just like the movie itself. Like I said though, the Christmas Carol throughline is almost a subplot. There's a lot more that you could discuss and explore when looking at the movie. There's certainly enough winter and Christmas imagery and themes to keep you entertained for years of holiday viewing.
There's an army of penguins with candy-cane striped missiles strapped to their backs.
There's a holiday ball with a not-so-subtle jazzy cover of “Super Freak” playing, which is my kind of way-too-on-the-nose gag.
There's the iconic mistletoe line, connecting Selina and Bruce even more.
Hell, this movie loves Winter so much Batman even turns their Batmobile into a bobsled at one point!
There are a lot of reasons why I think Batman Returns deserves to be in the holiday rotation for more people. First of all, it's a beautiful film. Burton's snowy, German fairy tale aesthetic shines through. There are a lot of interesting layers to sift through. I could write a whole article about the relationship between Penguin and Batman, Shreck and Catwoman, Batman and Shreck, etc. and how each of them reflect aspects of each other without losing anything in their own characterization. There's a lot to unpack there. There's also the fact that the supporting cast is loaded with character actors like Vincent Schiavelli, Pat Hingle, Michael Gough, Diane Salinger, Paul Reubens and Michael Murphy.
Most of all it deserves to be in the rotation because it's a very good, very quirky and strangely funny film. And it has a bittersweet ending that feels at home in December.
While Batman Returns doesn't end with a “God bless us, everyone” it does come pretty close.
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs on Monday acknowledged that President Barack Obama still "ocassionally falls of the wagon" when it comes to smoking cigarettes.
Gibbs was asked about Obama's smoking at the daily press briefing after the president's medical report released Sunday said that they are using nicotine replacement therapy.

"He is occassionally falls of the wagon when it comes to that," Gibbs said, adding that Obama "continues to chew nicotine gum."
Obama's opponents and some in the press raised their cigarette smoking as an issue on the campaign trail.
They noted that the president's status as a role model and their White House's push for healthy lifesyles warrant inquiries into their smoking habit.
Last June, Obama gave a similar answer to the press that Gibbs gave Monday. The president called themselves a "former smoker" who occasionally "slips up" and has a cigarette, but never in front of their family.
Gibbs said that they do not know when Obama smokes because they are not with the president 24 hours a day.

Could speculation about a main "Walking Dead" character being gay to be true?
Fans of the popular AMC zombie show have long questioned the sexuality of one of the lead characters, Daryl Dixon. Now, creator Robert Kirkman is addressing the rumors after they were directly asked about Daryl's sexuality in the letter column to "The Walking Dead" #130.
They told ComicBook.com, “All I can say is that it's been discussed. We have very specific ideas about Daryl's sexuality (or the seeming lack thereof), and if there's ever a quiet period in the show where he's not consistently distracted by crossbowing… we'll tackle it in the show.”
Kirkman also reportedly stated that AMC "absolutely would" allow the show's creators to make Daryl gay.
Introduction:
If you've played, watched or spoken to a Counter-Strike player over the last week, then you'll know about the controversy surrounding the newest pistol - the R8 Revolver. The gun entered the game with a bang, and if you were lucky (or unlucky enough depending on your point of view) to experience it for a day before its nerf, you can appreciate how broken it's first iteration really was. Able to one shot armored players from any distance to the abdomen, the R8 (worth $850) was the only gun in the game able to achieve this feat other than the AWP (worth $4750). See where the problem lies? A hotfix later, the gun now sits more in the category of pocket Scout than pocket AWP, still able to do devastating damage in the hands of a precision player but now much easier to counter play. So, how can this breath of fresh air best be used to overwhelm your foes?
The Mechanics:
To understand how to get the best use out of a new gun, it's best to do the boring stuff; look at tables and analyse a weapon's statistics. First things first, the Revolver sits in the same slot as the Desert Eagle, so players will need to make a choice of which weapon they prefer. It can be bought on both the T and CT sides and any kills will net $300. In terms of weapon design, the Revolver is unlike any other weapon in Counter-Strike as it has a left and right click fire mode. The left is a deadly accurate slow shot and the right is a barrage that has greatly reduced accuracy. This is to imitate the design of a hammer in a real life revolver, when you left-click with the Revolver you need to hold it for .4 of a second before the gun actually fires. The Revolver does slightly less damage then the scout having base damage of 86 as opposed to 88 and a slightly reduced range modifier of 0.94 compared to the scout's 0.98. To tabulate the damage model in terms of hitboxes:
Hitbox Unarmored Armored Head 342 319 Chest & Arm 85 79 Abdomen & Pelvis 107 99 Leg 64 64
This means that, like the Desert Eagle, the Revolver can one shot opponents from any range to the head and can also two shot people to the body, making it very powerful for the price. The weapon has a small clip of eight shots with only eight bullets in reserve, meaning you get two full rounds of eight shots. Furthermore movement with the Revolver is very slow for a weapon of its class, being 220 normally and 180 during charge time for the left click, in comparison the player moves at 195 units with the negev and 215 with the AK.
Side by Side: Examples of the left / right click functionality of the Revolver
The Strategy:
The key to using the Revolver effectively is to get used to the charge-up time on its shots and limit the negative effect that it can have on you. If you peek, spot an enemy, and then try to shoot, the .4-second delay on the shot plus your reaction time will get you killed before you can even get the first shot off. The best way to limit this pitfall is to pre-charge the shot around a corner, then peek and try to line up your shot. This makes it very difficult to land headshots against moving players and you'll have to have very quick reaction times. Furthermore, if you miss your first shot and are charged by an opponent it's unlikely that you'll have time to charge a second shot, which leaves you in the hands of RNG as you spam the inaccurate right click. If you're caught in the open at range always remember to keep moving while charging your shots, it'll make it harder for them to hit you and the movement accuracy of the revolver's left click shot is extremely high, making it a run and gun weapon for the precise player.
The Revolver is best paired with an automatic weapon, typically an SMG. The ability to tag an opponent for high damage at long range and then finish them while running and gunning with a few SMG bullets is invaluable and allows a lot of flexibility at close and long ranges. The effect is similar to buying a Scout and finishing players with a pistol but has the added bonus of extra kill rewards while still costing roughly the same amount - a Scout being $1750 while a Revolver is $850 combined with a cheap smg at $1050 or $1250 totals at $1900–$2100. In a team environment where you can better synergize buy strategies, I would recommend that only 1 or 2 players buy the Revolver because it's much easier to finish a tagged opponent with a more rapid firing weapon than having each player need to land a precise shot that takes time to charge.
To best use the revolver avoid situations where you're likely to get rushed down or where the opponent can peak you first forcing you to react. When it comes down to it, CS:GO is a game of seconds where a sliver of time can mean seeing an opponent round the corner or looking away and getting shot in the back. On paper .4 seconds is not a long period of time, but in game it can feel like years. Any time you don't take the initiative with the Revolver, you are at the disadvantage and are basically relying on your foe to make a mistake or on the RNG of the right click fire mode to flick a shot at your enemy's head. Often times it's best to take a shot or two then retreat or switch out to your other weapon rather than rely on a mechanic that is essentially out of your hands.
I didn't move my crosshair when spraying these 8 shots with the right click
Final Thoughts:
The Revolver is a fun weapon that fills an interesting niche in the pistol category being the only really long range option for consistent damage to both the head and body. When combined with effective team play or a cheap automatic weapon to finish injured opponents, the accuracy and high damage of this affordable pistol make it an effective and inexpensive choice for ranged combat and holding tight angles. If you haven't been successful with the Deagle, love using the Scout and AWP, or just want to try out a new weapon with interesting mechanics and awesome animations, I can highly recommend the R8 as both a satisfying and competitive edition to the CS:GO weapon roster.

[April Fools'] Hideo Kojima joins Capcom, set to direct Resident Evil reboot
Where one horror series fades into nothingness–another is ready to be reborn. It has been announced today that legendary games developer Hideo Kojima has signed on with Capcom. In an even more shocking turn of events, Capcom and Kojima announced that the first project he's set to direct is a reboot of Resident Evil. Kojima had the following to say on this exciting new project:
I've been a fan of Resident Evil ever since the first Paul W.S. Anderson film came out. What I hope to accomplish with this new game is to retain the core essence of ‘Resident Evil' from the film, while also expand upon its ideas of pharmaceutical companies exploiting people. The world we live in is one where we pop prescription pills so much that we're becoming less human–we are the bio organic weapons. It's time to fight back.
They then went on to discuss the transition from Konami to Capcom, and what he's been up to in general:
Well, it was rough finally leaving Konami after all these years, but it had to be done. At first I considered following my dreams of becoming a full time writer for the WWE, but deep down I will always be a game designer. Capcom seemed like a good choice, so here I am.
No actual details on this new Resident Evil projects exist, but Mr. Kojima did tweet something mysterious following this announcement.
A storied Fifth Avenue mansion and a sprawling Park Avenue penthouse will soon hit the market—- part of a worldwide portfolio of high-end properties owned by the former Yugoslavia, and worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
Last week, the leaders of five of the republics that used to make up the splintered nation finally agreed to sell off the remaining 51 properties acquired by strongman Josip Broz Tito, Yugoslavia's postwar dictator who ruled until their death in 1980.
Among the valuable real estate is 854 Fifth Ave., a Gilded Age mansion once occupied by Vanderbilt family heiress Emily Thorn Vanderbilt Sloane, that became the seat of the Yugoslavian mission to the UN.
A six-bedroom, four bathroom duplex apartments at 730 Park Ave. will also go on sale, according to the agreement signed last week by the leaders of Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Slovenia.
Appraisals have already been completed on the two properties, which are both in a state of disrepair, a source told The Post.
The Park Avenue co-op, valued at more than $20 million, has been empty since 1992 — a symbol of the collateral damage from the bitter fighting among the successor states.
The Yugoslav government purchased the residence in 1975 for $100,000.
In 2011, The Post exclusively toured the apartment and reported that the five republics had all laid claim to the residence, once occupied by Yugoslavia's ambassadors to the UN and Tito on their trips to New York.
For 24 years, Serbia has been paying the maintenance costs on the dust-filled 2,325-square foot residence. Maintenance is currently more than $14,000 per month, according to Serbian press reports.
At the Park Avenue building, where neighbors include Conde Nast co-owner Donald Newhouse, any potential purchaser would have to be prepared to spend four years renovating the dilapidated apartment. The building's strict rules only allow construction in the summer.
The six-story beaux arts mansion on Fifth Avenue, between 66th and 67th Streets, now houses Serbia's Permanent Mission to the UN.
Upon its completion in 1903, the 3,650-square foot building boasted two elevators, eight bathrooms and 32 rooms. It suffered heavy damage to its first floor when a bomb was tossed into its basement stairwell in the summer of 1975.
In recent years, homes of similar size on Fifth Avenue's Gold Coast, between East 60th and 85th Streets, have been listed between $28 million and $36 million.
Serbia will receive nearly 40 per cent of the proceeds from the sale of the New York properties, largely because it has maintained both of them for decades, Serbian press reports said last week.
Repeated calls and emails to Serbia's Permanent Mission to the UN were not returned last week.

Mayor of London backs campaign by Idris Elba, Lenny Henry and Meera Syal to urge Ofcom to set clear race representation guidelines for broadcasters
The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has called for speedy enforcement of clear new rules to ensure that all British broadcasters offer a fair representation of the country's ethnic makeup.
Letter from Sadiq Khan to Ofcom's Sharon White Read more
In a strongly worded letter to Ofcom head Sharon White, backed by the performer Lenny Henry, Khan urges that money to make more ethnically diverse television programmes should be ringfenced.
“The BBC, Sky TV, Channel 4 and the BFI all have different definitions, which at times are so broad that they can be met without employing a single person of colour either on or off-screen,” they write, endorsing Henry's plan for every qualifying BAME production to have 50% or more of its staff and talent BAME, as well as 30% of senior personnel.
“This year,” they told the Observer, “marks the 30th anniversary of Black History Month in the UK. It's time our broadcasters step up to the plate and redouble their efforts to be properly representative of the population as a whole.”
Taking White up on comments they made to the Guardian last month describing progress when it comes to BAME representation as “woeful” , the mayor argues that Ofcom should be prepared to act across the board. They join forces with campaigners such as Henry, Meera Syal and Idris Elba.
Supporting the letter, Henry said: “We all know that ‘if you can't see, you can't be'. Mr Khan's words are a direct plea to Ofcom to put pressure on broadcasters to represent minorities both on screen and behind the camera.”
The mayor also criticises the BBC for failing to show leadership. A series of mathematical dodges, they claim, has distorted the issue.
“Currently, statistics published by broadcasters on BAME employment in the broadcasting industry are inconsistent and, at times, misleading. They often merge those working in financial and commercial departments with those working on the creative or production side of the industry, thereby distorting the creative input of BAME representation in the broadcasting industry.
“At times, the statistics give little detail of who occupies editorial positions and levels of seniority of BAME staff. Furthermore, some statistics merge those working in overseas departments with those working in the UK, which can give a misleading impression of the level of BAME employment in the broadcasting industry among the UK population. It is clear that a more robust approach is needed.”
An Ofcom spokesperson said: “We share the Mayor's concern that broadcasters must do more to improve diversity on and off screen. We hope to meet the Mayor soon to discuss our current work on this important issue.”
MOSCOW — Russia has offered Iran advanced surface-to-air missiles after scrapping a similar deal in 2010 because of UN sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program, the state defense company said Monday.
Any such a deal is likely to go down badly in Washington as Western countries seek to keep up the pressure on Iran to agree a comprehensive deal on its nuclear activities.
Sergei Chemezov, head of the Rostec corporation which manages Russia's defense industry, said Moscow has offered to supply Antey-2500 missiles, an upgraded version of the S-300 air defense system that figured in the previous contract.
"We have offered them the Antey-2500," Chemezov was quoted as saying by RIA-Novosti news agency.
But they added: "The decision has not been made yet."
Moscow signed a contract in 2007 to deliver S-300 missiles to Iran worth $800 million.
The deal was intensely criticized by the United States and Israel, and Moscow later dropped it as being in breach of UN sanctions.
A UN resolution adopted in 2010 bans the supply, sale or transfer to Iran of missiles or missiles systems.

Chemezov said the Antey-2500 is a more modern version of the S-300, which Russia no longer makes. The same surface-to-air missiles were reportedly delivered to Venezuela in 2013.
Now under Western sanctions itself over the conflict in Ukraine, Russia — a permanent member of the UN Security Council — has strengthened its alliance with Iran.
Major-General Yuri Ivanov, 52, was the deputy head of Russia's foreign military intelligence arm known as GRU which is thought to operate the biggest network of foreign spies out of all of Russia's clandestine intelligence services.
Their badly decomposed body was found washed up on the Turkish coast by local fishermen earlier this month after they disappeared in the Syrian coastal resort of Latakia further south. The Russian army's in-house newspaper, Red Star, did not report their death until last Saturday when they were quietly buried in Moscow.
The circumstances of their death are reminiscent of a John Le Carre novel and have therefore fuelled theories that they may have been murdered in Syria and their body then thrown into the Mediterranean where it drifted for days.
According to the Kremlin, they were on holiday in Syria and died in a tragic swimming accident. However, other reports have suggested they were on official business and the location where they are reported to have disappeared was only about fifty miles from a strategically vital Russian naval facility in the Syrian port of Tartus which is being expanded and upgraded to service and refuel ships from Russia's Black Sea Fleet.
"It makes no sense that an American manufactured vehicle would be so challenging to get," says Tesla owner Matt Holm. "You have to jump through so many hoops."
When Elon Musk launched the first Tesla sports car in 2008, they didn't just set out to create a mass market for electric vehicles; Musk wanted to disrupt the entire auto industry by cutting out the dealership middleman and selling their cars directly to consumers.
Tesla's sales approach has resonated with customers who want a more interactive car buying experience. Holm, a realtor based in Austin, Texas is one of those Tesla converts. They spend a lot of time on the road driving clients in their Model S. They love the fact that their vehicle doesn't need much maintenance and can be charged overnight in their garage.
But when Matt went to purchase their Tesla, they couldn't just walk into a store and buy one.
"I actually had to go online, configure it, and order it sight unseen," says Holm. "It was like I was a spy or something getting some James-Bond car delivered."
Unlike the big car companies, Tesla doesn't have a network of independent dealerships that sell its cars. The company runs its own showrooms, but in Texas—along with Connecticut, Michigan, Louisiana, Utah, and West Virginia—the government makes it illegal to walk into a Tesla store and buy a car.
Tesla employees at these showrooms aren't even allowed to give pricing information or to direct customers to the company's website. Test drives require a special permit from the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles.
Almost every state has some sort of restriction on directly purchasing cars from manufacturers. The purpose of these franchise laws, which date to the 1930s, is to prevent car buyers from cutting out the middlemen—a big political constituency. The Lone Star State has nearly 1,300 franchised car dealerships employing about 100,000 people.
The National Auto Dealers Association (NADA) has repeatedly argued that the current system of franchised dealers is necessary to protect consumers and ensure fair competition. In a speech before the Automotive Press Association last October, NADA chairperson Jeff Carlson stated that consumers preferred the dealership sales model and that dealership networks were "the best, most efficient, and most pro-consumer way of selling new cars and trucks."
But if car buyers really preferred going through third-party dealers, why do they need government protection?
Car manufacturers have tried to sell straight to consumers prior to Tesla. In the late 1990s, Ford attempted to circumvent the dealerships in Texas by starting its own stores and selling used cars through their own company website. The Texas Department of Transportation ruled that this violated the state's franchise laws and ordered Ford to shut down operations.
Ford was also hit with a $1.7 million state fine. The following year, then Texas Governor George W. Bush signed a law that strengthened protections for the dealership cartel.
Now Musk is taking their own shot at selling direct to consumers. According to figures from the Texas Ethics Commission, Tesla has spent over $1.2 million on Texas lobbyists in the last five years as part of an effort to eliminate the direct sales ban.
Rep. Jason Isaac, a Republican state legislator from Dripping Springs, Texas, introduced a bill in the 2017 legislative session that would get rid of car dealership rules. "It's truly not a free-market approach," says Isaac. "What my bill basically says is that a manufacturer of an automobile can sell direct to the consumer if they want to."
But Isaac has come up against the the politically connected Texas Auto Dealers Association (TADA), which opposes any efforts to change franchise laws. TADA claims that allowing Tesla to sell directly to consumers is a violation of "true free market" principles by giving Musk and Tesla "a monopoly just for them."
Lawmakers didn't act on Isaac's bill this session, making it the third legislative defeat for Tesla's reform effort in Texas.
But Elon Musk's campaign to remake the car industry is a hint of big changes to come. Google plans to bring its autonomous vehicles to market and even Apple, which pulled off one of the greatest retail success stories of the last 20 years by opening its own network of stores, is working on its own car. If Silicon Valley succeeds in its quest to take over this nearly trillion dollar industry, the dealership model may not last.
"I think consumers are going to start demanding this more and more as they realize, 'Wait there's an autonomous vehicle coming and I can't buy it? Why is that?,'" states Isaac. "We've got to find some free market solutions that allow those companies to sell direct to their consumers."
Lonely older adults have increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes as well as increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Previous behavioral treatments have attempted to reduce loneliness and its concomitant health risks, but have had limited success. The present study tested whether the 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program (compared to a Wait-List control group) reduces loneliness and downregulates loneliness-related pro-inflammatory gene expression in older adults (N = 40). Consistent with study predictions, mixed effect linear models indicated that the MBSR program reduced loneliness, compared to small increases in loneliness in the control group (treatment condition × time interaction: F(1,35) = 7.86, p = .008). Moreover, at baseline, there was an association between reported loneliness and upregulated pro-inflammatory NF-κB-related gene expression in circulating leukocytes, and MBSR downregulated this NF-κB-associated gene expression profile at post-treatment. Finally, there was a trend for MBSR to reduce C Reactive Protein (treatment condition × time interaction: (F(1,33) = 3.39, p = .075). This work provides an initial indication that MBSR may be a novel treatment approach for reducing loneliness and related pro-inflammatory gene expression in older adults.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev took part in 2011 homicide in which three men's throats were cut, according to man later killed by police
Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev was named as a participant in an earlier triple homicide by a man who was shot to death while being questioned by authorities, according to a filing by federal prosecutors in the case against their brother, surviving suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.
According to the filing on Monday, Ibragim Todashev told investigators Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was shot dead by police shortly after the bombing, took part in a triple murder in Waltham on 11 September 2011.
In that case, three men were found in an apartment with their throats cut and their bodies reportedly covered with marijuana. One of the victims was a boxer and friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev.
Todashev, a 27-year-old martial arts fighter, was fatally shot at their Orlando home during a meeting with an FBI agent and two Massachusetts state troopers in May, according to authorities. They had turned violent while being questioned, they said.
The filing is the prosecutors' attempt to block Dzhokhar Tsarnaev from getting certain information from authorities, including investigative documents associated with the Waltham killings.
"The government has already disclosed to Tsarnaev that, according to Todashev, Tamerlan Tsarnaev participated in the Waltham triple homicide," prosecutors wrote.
According to prosecutors, the investigation into the 2011 murders is reason not to allow Dzhokhar Tsarnaev access to documents.
"Any benefit to Tsarnaev of knowing more about the precise 'nature and extent' of their brother's involvement does not outweigh the potential harm of exposing details of an ongoing investigation into an extremely serious crime, especially at this stage of the proceeding," prosecutors wrote.
Prosecutors also said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was not entitled to the information because their brother's criminal history would be relevant only at a possible future sentencing hearing, if at all.
A phone message left for a spokesperson for the US attorney's office was not immediately returned on Tuesday night. A message left for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's federal public defender was also not immediately returned.
Authorities allege that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, and 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, ethnic Chechens from Russia, planned and carried out the twin bombings near the finishing line of the marathon on 15 April. Three people were killed and more than 260 injured in the attack.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev faces 30 federal charges, including using a weapon of mass destruction and 16 other charges that carry the possibility of the death penalty.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a gun battle with police as authorities closed in on the brothers several days after the bombings.
Truman's war never ended. An uneasy armistice persists. The heavily fortified 2.5 mile Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separates North and South. Occasional incidents occur.
America needs enemies to justify bloated military spending. Pyongyang is America's longstanding Asian punching bag.
It's wanted normalized relations for decades. Washington wants adversarial ones instead.
In response to its recent ballistic missile tests, neocon US UN envoy Nikki Haley denounced DPRK leader Kim Jong-un, calling them irrational, displaying “unbelievable, irresponsible arrogance…”
Korean War, 1950-53. The total destruction of Pyongyang by US forces
“(A)ll options are on the table,” they added. “We are making those decisions now and we will act accordingly,” provocatively suggesting possible war.
Washington rejects diplomacy. China asked the Trump administration to halt joint military activities with South Korea (Pyongyang considers preparations for war) in exchange for the DPRK suspending its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
State Department spokesperson Mark Toner rejected Beijing's proposal, saying “(w)hat we're doing in terms of our defense cooperation with South Korea is in no way comparable to the blatant disregard that North Korea has shown with respect to international law.”
No nations more egregiously violate it than America, Israel and their rogue partners in high crimes. North Korea never attacked another country throughout its post-WW II history. Truman's war turned much of the country to rubble.
Taking its cue from Washington, South Korea also rejected halting its military exercises, its UN envoy Cho Tae-yul, saying “(t)his is not the time for us to talk about freezing or dialogue with North Korea.”
The Obama administration rejected a similar Pyongyang proposal in 2015, opting for continued adversarial relations.
China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged negotiations to avoid a possible “head-on collision.” Its UN envoy Lie Jieyi warned “if you look at…the development of events now on the Korean peninsula, there is a real danger.” There's a real risk.”
The alternative to China's proposal is “escalat(ed) tension(s), and the situation may get out of control.” Provocations on the peninsula affect Beijing's security, why it wants military confrontation avoided.
Next week, Secretary of State Tillerson meets with their Japanese, Chinese and South Korean counterparts, talks focusing on Pyongyang's “advancing nuclear and missile threat,” according to the State Department.
Despite strong objections by Russia and China, citing a serious threat to their security, Washington began deploying Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missile systems in South Korea.
Discussed in a previous article, they're designed to intercept and down short, medium and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase. Instead of warheads, they rely on impact kinetic energy to destroy incoming missiles.
Deploying THAADs is more about targeting Russia and China than North Korea, both countries warning of escalating tensions and instigating an arms race.
Is Trump contemplating Korean war 2.0? Launching it would be madness.

Keegan-Michael Key grew up in Detroit, went to college in the city and helped found one of Detroit's most well-known Improv theaters (Planet Ant in Hamtramck, Michigan) before heading to Hollywood to star in the former Comedy Central hit show, “Key and Peele.”
Along the way, the 44-year-old never lost their Detroit Lions fandom, including vivid memories of Billy Sims karate-kicking a defender on a hurdle in a game -- something Key said they tried to emulate as a kid, getting them in trouble. After chatting with Key about the potential acting future of Lions wide receiver Lance Moore, we spoke about their Lions love – including their Hail Mary reaction and what they think of the Lions now.
Keegan-Michael Key has been a Lions fan since the Billy Sims teams of the early 1980s. Casey Curry/Invision for the Television Academy/AP Images
Have you always been a Lions fan? Is this a lifelong deal?
Keegan-Michael Key: I've been a Lions fan since I was, gosh, 9 or 10, go over to my friend's house in the University District over by U of D and watch the games because they were winning games. They were winning games. I've always loved Billy Sims and any time I bump into a Detroiter out here, we always talk about ‘Mel Farr, Superstar, for a Farr better deal,' and Lem Barney and stuff like that. It's been a big part of my life. My parents were not big sports fans, but my mother loved Barry Sanders, but they aren't a huge fan. Now they like Calvin Johnson. He's such an amazing athlete and such a wonderful, humble guy.
I've always been a fan and I was about to jump off an airplane. I was in the sky on an airplane when they lost that Thursday night game on a Hail Mary to Green Bay. I could have opened the window and jumped out the plane. I couldn't believe it. And I had this feeling of dread come over me as soon as they made the face-mask call, which, by the way, I thought was a wonderful piece of acting by my friend Aaron Rodgers. They should go into acting. They definitely have a future in acting. Fifteen yards. Anyway, the Hail Mary pass and I turned to a complete stranger sitting behind me on the plane and said, ‘Did you see that? Did you F'n see that?' Fifteen yards, first down, one more play left, Aaron Rodgers and they put the pass deep. I'm like, this is going to be it. This is against the Lions.
Being a Lions fan is like being a Cubs fan. You just have to keep going. You don't have a choice. You can't give up because one day when it happens, and I believe it'll happen, then you can really savor it because you were there in the doldrums and you get to be there in the victory. I don't want anyone ever accusing me of being a fair-weather fan. I'm wearing a Lions hat right now.
Do you watch every game live? What's your routine?
Key: I have my NFL package but I've been having a really, really, really busy year. So I missed Sunday's game and I haven't been able to watch. I've been traveling back-and-forth between Los Angeles and New York. I am an avid television watcher and I've watched the least amount of television in the past few months than I think I have in my entire life. Including birth. And so I've not been able to watch all the games but my typical plan for the past seven years of my life living in Los Angeles, or 10 years of my life, I would either go to church, DVR the game, go home and watch the game every single Sunday. Or, I would go down to my friend's house and we'd watch the game at their house. So I try as hard as I can to not miss games. This year, I was going to go to the game on [Dec.] 27, but I'm not. I have to travel. Next year, I'm going to make much more of a concerted effort to go see more games, like literally see live games. I've yet to be in Ford Field. I haven't even been able to go yet. It's a good thing to say about the career that I haven't had the time. But I'd like to sneak a few games in there.
What do you think of the Lions now?
Key: I think there's more frustration now, a lot more frustration now, but for good reason. People have been saying this for about 15 years but if you're a lifelong fan, 15 years of frustration is good because we've been trying to build and build and build and build a team that was worthwhile. Now we have a lot of component parts and so what I think the issue has to be is it has to be front office. We have such talented players on our team and people talk like, ‘Detroit is so good, why can't they get their act together?' I don't know the answer to that question, but I would rather take that frustration over the frustration of them just being horrible all the time. There were times when Joey Harrington was there, we just can't get it together. Joey is one of those people where you get so frustrated because you went, ‘How can someone that talented, why can't we get it together?' It's actually more frustrating now than it was in the late 80s and early 90s. We were just bad, like we were just horrible, we don't expect anything, who cares. Now, the Lions fans are more apprehensive and we care more because we know the talent is there. We're not one player away, we're one coach away. We're one general manager away. That's what's going on now.
In most shots of the two John Wick movies, John Wick is the only thing worth looking at.
Oh, sure, sometimes enemies dare confront him, rushing in from off-camera to be dispatched with a quick, brutal barrage of bullets. But the camera is usually pinned to them as they dance and swirls amid the chaos, a strangely graceful weapon of a man.
Rating 3.5
John Wick: Chapter 2 is only rarely a movie about two people having a fight, because only a handful of people in the John Wick universe can go toe-to-toe with Wick. No, John Wick: Chapter 2 is about trying to get inside the head of — maybe even empathize with — a death machine.
Wick's world, which seems to operate by some mysterious assassin's code that may as well have been handed down wholesale from the middle ages, is always needlessly byzantine when something more straightforward would do. But Wick themselves is as stripped-down and simple in their motivations as possible. In 2014's John Wick, they avenged the death of their dog; in the new sequel, he's mad somebody burned down their house (though this grows more complicated).
Related Why John Wick rules so hard
Sure, the John Wick movies nod toward, say, how hard it is to break cycles of revenge and other standard action movie tropes. But they're mostly about how good it would feel to be a one-man army, to be able to kill anybody you see with minimal struggle, even if all you had on hand was a pencil.
In this way, the John Wick movies capture, better than any other action movies, the peculiar feeling of being an American in the 21st century: blessed with immense power but always kinda bummed out about it.
Abandon your moral compass, all ye who enter here
The standard adjective to apply to Wick is “balletic.” By this, critics usually mean that the action sequences in a film are so beautifully and tightly choreographed that they approximate the feeling of watching a dance number or an elaborate slapstick comedy routine. (For a good example of how the word “balletic” can apply to action, watch literally any fight scene featuring Jackie Chan in their prime.)
To be sure, the action sequences and gunfights in both Wick movies have moments of sheer, choreographed wonder. But for the most part, they're solo numbers — or, at best, a duet between actor Keanu Reeves and director Chad Stahelski's camera. Wick holds centerstage, blowing away all who would dare oppose him.
That, of course, makes it all the more thrilling when a worthy opponent for Wick comes along, and Stahelski lets both hold the center of the screen while their fight goes on. In John Wick: Chapter 2, the most worthy opponent is Cassian, played by Common, as the biggest threat Wick has yet faced. (He has more trouble dispatching Cassian than entire rooms full of goons.) In one thrilling shot, Stahelski sends Wick and Cassian careening down opposite sides of a row of parked cars, ducking and weaving to fire at each other. In that moment, it really does feel like they're doing an elaborate dance.
But these thrilling moments are fewer and farther between than you might expect. Every Wick movie is structured to suggest that only a couple of people on the face of the planet can stand with John Wick, that even if you send an endless army after him, they will gun down every member of that army. The scripts' video game-like structure — right down to a “level” in John Wick: Chapter 2 that could be called “The Catacombs” — further enhances this dehumanization of Wick's opponents. He's a wrecking ball, and they're there to be wrecked.
To be clear, this is a feature, not a bug. The John Wick movies are about momentum, about Wick moving so precisely and so quickly that they reach a point where they feel more god than man. If some action movie protagonists are regular folks, whose prowess is enhanced by the unusual circumstances in which they find themselves, Wick is superhuman. He's aspirational, not relatable.
Yet this also means the films are actively inviting you to imagine yourself as a one-person murder factory. Because the movies usually don't have dramatic tension in the traditional sense — you don't really worry that John Wick will lose a fight, because, well, look at the title — they instead derive their tension from, say, wondering how Wick will get out of this latest trap, or whether all of this weighs on their soul just a little bit.
To the series' credit, it's at least interested in the question of Wick's ultimate morality — or, maybe, it knows it should pretend to be interested. But the moments when, say, Wick says they worry about being damned are brushed aside by Stahelski's sheer skill at staging operatic action. The brutality and bloodshed lose any of the weight the movie wants them to have when they take place in a gigantic hall of mirrors punctuated by occasional flare-ups of digital flame.
John Wick: Chapter 2 is the rare sequel to expand a film's universe without getting too complicated
Those questions of morality may be what you leave John Wick: Chapter 2 thinking about. But during the movie, you'll be too swept up in Wick's journey from where they settled at the end of the first film (in a flimsy “retirement”) back into the world of skullduggery and assassinations to think about much else.
John Wick 2 is pretty clearly designed as the middle section of a trilogy — though news of John Wick 3 is not yet available, and Stahelski will be spending the next while on their Highlander remake. It picks up on loose threads introduced in the first film in hopes of weaving them into a bigger picture, then very clearly creates a new status quo a third film can pick up whenever it arrives.
What's most remarkable about John Wick 2 is that none of the above trips it up. As anyone who watched, say, the Pirates of the Caribbean films can attest, retrofitting a largely terrific standalone film into an ongoing saga is ridiculously difficult to pull off. And there are times when John Wick 2 introduces some new piece of mythology or some larger aspect of its crime-ridden world that threaten to topple over into self-serious camp. The film flirts with the “saga” taking precedence over the immediate story, but it always ends up on the right side of the line, sometimes miraculously.
This is because whenever Stahelski and screenwriter Derek Kolstad box themselves in with Too Much Story, Wick just shoots their way out of it. For example: There's a lot of business here about a new character who wants their sister dead, so they can take their seat as one of 12 at The Table; instead of turning this into a chance to over-explain what The Table is or something similar, the film trusts that you'll figure it out amid John Wick killing people. (You will.)
Over-explanation is the enemy of stripped-down tales like John Wick, which is why it's so refreshing that even as it expands and deepens its already existing crime-ridden world (which includes such delightful idiosyncrasies as a network of homeless assassins spying on everybody, and the return of the first movie's Hotel for Assassins and its proprietor, played by the great Ian McShane), it keeps things relatively simple. John Wick 2 has a firm sense of its rules and how they interact with its characters and setting, but also a belief that viewers can keep up.
And Stahelski never met a frame they couldn't turn into a visual presentation on theology and/or art history. (One character hangs out in a museum pretty much so they can loiter in front of marble statues all the time.) They and cinematographer Dan Laustsen are always lighting characters so half their faces are swathed in shadow, and, yeah, we get it. This is an unsettling world. But boy, does it look great.
Yet even at its grandest, most operatic heights, it's hard to escape the sheer amount of death John Wick deals out, sometimes just because it's easiest. The film embraces its own murky center when Wick makes some truly questionable moral decisions, but it also tries to suggest that's just the world they live in, that he's bound by the codes they pretend to follow.
Then again, maybe that's the point. Wick is a cipher of a man, and pretty much all we know about them is that they love their dead wife, their pets, and their stuff. He's played by Reeves, one of our most famously remote actors (though a tremendous physical performer). They are, in every frame where they stand alone, a one-man bullet storm, an invitation to consider how hard it would be to exercise restraint if we possessed their weapons and skills, how we're all of us closer to sinking into hell than we might pretend.
John Wick: Chapter 2 is in theaters everywhere.

Well here's part of the story, some context as you listen to the show. If you don't care to read concert stories, please scroll below to the five stars for review of show and recording
We got to stay at the little motel on the grounds for cheap since my sister caught wind of the dates before public release. We shared our shower with camper friends old & new, as did our neighbors. High water meter readings certainly was not on the resort's radar, and it felt so good to share the clean.
After the first night, those staying down in the valley went out an exit down by the stage, not up the big steep hill hill towards golf course with everyone else. There was this rickety rope-and-slats foot bridge over a dark little gully that security made everyone use. The Dead motorcade drilled majorily bright spotlights at about eye level of those crossing the little swingy bridge.
Security sorted people crossing into obvious couples, just guys and single women. While waiting to cross, as we got close I saw exchanged glances amongst security, how among other things they watched the women to follow the women's eyes as each crossed the bridge, apparently looking to see if the woman was looking to a man, a friend, a group, on their own, what not.
This whole thing was very time consuming, but security would not let people just go on their way to either side of the little bridge, down the gully on their own to get up to their room, and I didn't see anybody sucking it up to go the long way up the steep long grassy alpine hill to concessions, through cattle chutes, parking lot and greenways to get back down and up.
Then security shoved me away from my friends and out onto the bridge as a solo girl. I was blinded by klieg lights, with the entire surroundings blacked out such that even the spaced out slats for the next step on the rope bridge couldn't be seen ...don't want to miss the next slat, do want to keep an eye on the crowd.
Don't know who works for whom, don't want to fall off that bridge, do want to reunite with rest of group, and can't help but hear men's voices in the dark as each woman passed by. Pretend to be Scarlet Begonia.
Finally, later on, tootsies up at the room, then a quick dip, and ease on into the wee hours, breakfast at the hotel on Lake Geneva the next morning.
"With the exciting kickoffs of some songs its amazing how polite and quiet the crowd is.Quite an audience for sure."
+ Well, for sure. Even the Minnesota and the Milwaukee chapters of the Hell's Angels were very careful not to wreck the greens. Reasons for all around good manners by all concerned include: wanting to be invited back next year, being raised that way, and for the benefit of our tapers.

Excellent recording of excellent performance. I loved Bob in Good Loving, their earnest delivery "blind man knows when the sun is shining because they can feel it. How 'bout you?"
Best spin on "Satisfaction/(can't get no)" ever.
No doubt participant bias here, but what the heck, within mere minutes of the opening punchy homage to the Stones, the Grateful Dead owned this tune. If there is another jam that takes it further,
please share via forum.
...disclosure about the bridge: I variously experienced it as a big city suspension bridge, a wrought iron train bridge, a graham cracker & Nuthella model bridge, etc., so I got to acknowledge I don't recall for a fact exactly what it was made of or what shape it was in when I crossed over to the other side.

The next Gears of War game for Xbox One developed by Black Tusk will hearken back to the core essence of the series, Black Tusk producer Rod Fergusson has said.
"With Black Tusk, we have to show that we have a legitimate claim to this IP and be able to show we know how to do it right before we do it differently," Fergusson told Polygon in an interview. "There are some things that even though people try to copy us, we don't think they've nailed. I think the cover system, there's a feel to a Gears of War game that I've yet to find in another game where it feels the same. Whether it's the fluidity, the weight, the heaviness to the characters, the way that it feels like to be in cover, the roadie run character, those sorts of things."
Fergusson didn't share any details about where and when in the Gears of War universe the next game will take place, but did mention that the previous games left big gaps in the timeline and many unanswered questions.
"There's lots of stuff, backstory from the E Day, Pendulum Wars all the way to Gears 3, there's a lot of room in there," they said. "But I don't know if that's the place to go. I think there are lots of other places to go as well."
Fergusson was an executive producer on the first two Gears of War games and a director of production on Gears of War 3. In 2012 they left Epic Games and joined Irrational Games, where they helped the team ship BioShock Infinite. Fergusson then launched a new studio for 2K in the San Francisco area, but left that job for Black Tusk before we found out what they were working on.
Microsoft, which purchased the Gears of War franchise from Epic Games earlier this year for an undisclosed sum, has yet to announce a release date for the game.

DJ Campbell: Among six Blackburn players who have been transfer-listed
Best, Goodwillie and Campbell have all been made available for transfer after spending time out on loan this season.
Midfielder Dickson Etuhu is also for sale along with Alex Marrow, while Jordan Slew is on the list after appearing just twice in three years.
Best and Campbell made just 15 Championship appearances between for Rovers them last season, while Goodwillie spent the campaign at Dundee United and Blackpool.
Etuhu, meanwhile, spoke only this week about their desire to stay at Ewood Park following an injury-hit two years.
They said: "The fans have only seen 50% of me as a player. I am just hoping I can have a full pre-season and then the fans will get to see my qualities.
"I have played for a few teams but this is the one club I have not left my mark and before I leave this place, I have got to do that.
"I have business here I need to deal with and I am looking forward to doing that next year."
Luke Varney, meanwhile, expects to join the club permanently on a free transfer this summer after a loan spell at the end of the season.
They told the Lancashire Telegraph: "The gaffer's said it will be a clean slate for me next season and that's what you want to hear."
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced on Wednesday that it had arrested the former deputy treasurer of the City of Compton for stealing $3.7 million from city coffers.
In a press release, the FBI stated:
Salvador Galvan, 47, of La Mirada, was arrested this morning by special agents with the FBI pursuant to a criminal complaint that charges them with theft concerning programs receiving federal funds. … Galvan, who worked in the Compton Treasurer's Office for more than 20 years, was responsible for tallying the cash received by the city as payment for parking tickets, business licenses and other fees. After the cash was counted, Galvan prepared the money for deposit into a city bank account. According to the criminal complaint filed late yesterday in United States District Court, Galvan skimmed cash from the daily receipts on numerous occasions. An audit of the city's cash deposits “identified discrepancies which vary from approximately $200 to $8,000 per day,” according to the affidavit in support of the complaint.
According to the FBI, Galvan had lived an increasingly luxurious lifestyle. They were also reportedly noted for their “generosity,” according to a work colleague.
Galvan had already been arrested on similar charges last year by the Los Angeles County Sherrif's Department, and faces new charges as a result of further FBI investigations, the press release stated.
If convicted, Galvan faces up to five years in federal prison.
Other Los Angeles County municipalities have seen major conviction cases in recent years. The most notorious was the corruption in the City of Bell, a predominantly poor municipality in which officials enriched themselves at public expense.
One city administrator in Bell was arrested in 2010 sentenced in 2014 to 12 years in prison for their “Godfather” role in the corruption scheme, which included stealing $8.8 million.
Compton is a relatively poor and working-class city, whose residents are primarily Latino and African-American, and which has become internationally famous through its export of West Coast hip-hop music and culture.
When the Russian dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote their epic, The Gulag Archipelago, some Americans read it to measure the gulf between the brute savagery of communism and the principled standards of free, civilized nations. But apparently some Americans took it as a helpful how-to volume.
Where would CIA officers have gotten the idea to extract cooperation from detainees by keeping them awake for as long as 180 hours at a time, or more than a week? Maybe from the jailers in Solzhenitsyn's grim account, who used the method on a mass scale.
Enforced sleeplessness, they explained, was favored because it was cheap, easy, and left no marks on the prisoner—not to mention that it was effective. Solzhenitsyn attested from bitter experience that "it is not really necessary to use a rack or hot coals to drive a human being out of their mind."
But American intelligence officials also learned something from the Soviets about manipulating language to conceal reality. When our enemies use methods like this, they amount to torture. When we do, they don't. A newly released 2002 memo from a Bush administration official authorized keeping prisoners awake because "we are not aware of any evidence that sleep deprivation results in severe physical pain or suffering."
That document, signed by Assistant Atty. Gen. Jay Bybee, also deprecates the unpleasantness of waterboarding, which makes the victim feel they are literally drowning. "The waterboard, which inflicts no pain or actual harm whatsoever, does not, in our view, inflict 'severe pain or suffering,'" they announced. "The waterboard is simply a controlled acute episode, lacking the connotation of a protracted period of time generally given to suffering." Did I mention that it leaves no marks?
The Bush administration and its defenders have long ridiculed anyone protesting the abuse of detainees. Former CIA director Michael Hayden and former Atty. Gen. Michael Mukasey, writing recently in The Wall Street Journal, lamented that under President Obama, "the U.S. will no longer interrupt the sleep cycle of captured terrorists even to help elicit intelligence that could save the lives of its citizens." The message is simple: It's not really torture, and it works.
The former is obviously untrue as well as dishonest: Solzhenitsyn makes that clear. So do numerous U.S. government reports accusing various regimes of violating human rights through such forms of torture as sleep deprivation. Likewise, the U.S. government used to take a negative view of waterboarding. But apparently we only object when we're not the ones doing it.
That doesn't change the nature of the practice. In a confidential 2007 report that recently was leaked, the International Committee of the Red Cross outlined the harsh methods used on CIA detainees and reached the blunt conclusion that they "amounted to torture and/or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."
But some people don't care whether these methods qualify as torture as long as they yield useful information—as Hayden and former Vice President Dick Cheney attest they do. Whether that's true is hard for an outsider to know. The Bush administration claimed that the waterboarding of Khalid Sheik Mohammad helped foil a planned 2002 attack on Los Angeles—forgetting that they aren't captured until 2003. Maybe we'll get a better answer if the administration grants Cheney their request that it declassify material supporting their case, as it should.
Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair has their doubts. "The information gained from these techniques was valuable in some instances, but there is no way of knowing whether the same information could have been obtained through other means," they said. "The bottom line is these techniques have hurt our image around the world, the damage they have done to our interests far outweighed whatever benefit they gave us and they are not essential to our national security."
And if effectiveness is the only gauge, why even debate whether these techniques fit the definition of torture? The problem with using "it worked" as an argument is that it justifies too much. By that rationale, we can justify subjecting enemy captives to every form of torture ever devised. We can even justify torturing and killing their spouses, siblings, parents, and children, right in front of them.
Cheney and others have yet to advocate going that far. But if they really believe what they say about the techniques we've used, here's a question they need to answer: Why not?

A group of Russian scientists in Antarctica has succeeded in drilling to a lake buried two miles beneath the icy landmass, the state-run Russian news service Ria Novosti reported -- following a week of radio silence from the team that had some scratching their heads.
“Yesterday, our scientists stopped drilling at the depth of 3,768 meters and reached the surface of the sub-glacial lake,” the source reportedly said in a story posted Monday, Feb. 6.
An unnamed source with Russia's Federal Service for Hydrometeorology confirmed the news as well, Russian business newspaper The View reported.
John Priscu, a microbiologist with Montana State University who has worked on a similar Antarctic exploration program, hopes Vostok and other subglacial lakes buried beneath the continent may offer a glimpse of extreme new forms of life.
"If they were successful, their efforts will transform the way we do science in Antarctica and provide us with an entirely new view of what exists under the vast Antarctic ice sheet," they told FoxNews.com.
The team from Russia's Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) had been drilling for weeks in an effort to reach isolated Lake Vostok, a vast, dark body of water hidden 13,000 ft. below the ice sheet's surface. The lake hasn't been exposed to air in more than 20 million years.
Russia has not yet officially confirmed the breakthrough.
Beyond the fantastic science, Ria Novosti noted a number of rumors about the lake, including one that talks of a secret Nazi sub base, and the bodies of Hitler and their mistress being delivered there for cloning -- fantastic stories that again are surfacing in the Russian press.
A brief break in communication with colleagues in the unfrozen world had some asking questions about the scientists, as Antarctica's killing winter draws near. But despite the lack of info and onset of winter, which brings temperatures as low as -80 F or colder, the team was never in danger, Priscu said.
"They are very capable scientists and drillers and the thought never entered my mind that they are in any kind of danger," they told FoxNews.com.
The buried lake may be similar to the conditions on Mars and Jupiter's moon Europa, Ria Novosti said.
The Lake Vostok project has been years in the making, with initial drilling at the massive lake -- 6,060 square miles (15,690 square kilometers) -- starting in 1998. The scientists were quickly able to reach 11,800 feet (3,600 meters), but had to stop due to concerns of possible contamination of the never-before-touched lake water.
The scientists came up with a clever way to make sure the water would not be contaminated: They agreed to drill until a sensor warned them of free water. At that point they took out the kerosene and adjusted the pressure so that none of the liquids would fall into the lake, but rather lake water would rise through the hole due to pressure from below.
The Russians are not alone in such a mission: Scientists from around the world are literally racing to explore the mysteries of Antarctica. There are two other Antarctic digs underway.
A team from the British Antarctic Survey is on a competing mission, set to plumb the depths of Lake Ellsworth, one of a string of more than 370 lakes beneath Antarctica that may soon see light for the first time. And a third Antarctic expedition -- a study of the subglacial Whillans Ice Stream -- mainly features U.S. scientists.
"Va rog asteptati mesajul nostru oficial. Mitingul nostru va fi unul autorizat", a scris Liviu Plesoianu.
Ulterior, a precizat, la Antena 3, ca decizia PSD a fost luata in cursul diminetii de sambata.
"Nu e vorba de o contramanifestatie, respectam dreptul oamenilor de a manifesta, de a ne spune inclusiv ca suntem ciuma rosie (...) dar avem si noi dreptul, cei care nu suntem poporul lui Iohannis ca avem si noi dreptul sa ne facem ziua auzita. Vom face totul ca la carte, totul va fi organizat, autorizat, iar daca va fi vreun incident va fi responsabilitatea dl. Klaus Werner Iohannis", a declarat Plesoianu.
El a adaugat ca, din cauza procedurilor de autorizare, mitingul va putea avea loc saptamana viitoare.
Ministrul Muncii, Lia Olguta Vasilescu, sustine ca, spre deosebire de liderul PSD Liviu Dragnea, ea este de parere ca social-democratii trebuie sa iasa in strada sa protesteze, pentru ca actualele miscari de strada sunt politizate, iar opozitia vrea sa aduca din nou "tehnocratii" la putere.
"Eu cred ca ar trebui sa organizam si noi un miting! Noi, 'ciuma rosie', care aplicam cel mai bun program de guvernare de pana acum. Pentru ca aici ma despart in opinii de Liviu Dragnea. A venit momentul sa vorbim si noi! Cred ca trebuie sa iesim in strada! Parlamentul e sufrageria unor domni si doamne fara locuinta momentan si avem senzatia ca ii deranjam cand venim dimineata la serviciu. Si par si un pic stresati ca nu au avut unde sa faca dus", a scris ea.
Precizam faptul ca presedintele PSD Liviu Dragnea afirma joi, in conferinta de presa, ca nu este de acord cu organizarea de mitinguri: "Colegii sunt foarte încărcaţi de discuţiile şi mesajele pe care le primesc de la concetăţeni, de la oamenii care ne susţin şi care ne-au votat şi care simt, în mod organic, la un moment dat şi ei dorinţa să se exprime în stradă. Eu nu am de gând să accept sau să dau posibilitatea colegilor noştri să organizeze vreun miting. Eu nu am de gând să scoatem în stradă un milion de oameni, pentru că ar fi o luptă între români şi eu aşa ceva nu accept. În schimb le-am cerut colegilor mei, păstrându-ne această atitudine paşnică şi deschisă către dialog, să declanşeze începând de mâine (vineri - n.r.) o strângere de semnături pentru a-şi arăta susţinerea pentru ceea ce voiau să spună dacă ieşeau în stradă, în speranţa că violenţele de azi-noapte nu vor mai fi văzute în zilele următoare şi din dorinţa de a nu escalada acest conflict" a declarat el.

By Michael Graetzel, Special to CNN
Editor's note: Michael Graetzel is a professor at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, where they direct the Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces. They have consulted for technology firm G24i. The views expressed are their own.
For two centuries, we have been burning billions of years of photosynthetic residue, better known as fossil fuel, to power our factories, homes, vehicles and cities. But we may not need to do this much longer – solar resources are great enough for all of us. Indeed, it may surprise many to learn that the amount of solar energy striking the earth in one hour is equal to the total energy consumed by all of humanity in a whole year. Learning to capture more of this resource could yield huge dividends for humanity.
Here at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland we have developed a solar cell technology that takes its cue from photosynthesis: dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). By separating the components for light absorption (which determines the cell's color) and the transportation of electrical current, this technology is remarkably similar to natural photosynthesis and provides unique benefits for integrating solar cells into everyday life. The color tunability and transparency of the cells, as well as an enhanced efficiency in indoor light – power conversion efficiencies can reach over 12 percent at full sunlight intensity and more than 25 percent for interior lighting – afford DSCs the opportunity to extend solar power generation seamlessly and conveniently into our office buildings and living rooms.
The start-up company G24i, meanwhile, has already licensed this technology for marketing commercial products and entered into partnership with Logitech and Texas Instruments to create light-powered computer and iPad peripherals, as well as solar powered blinds and shades. (G24i has produced a short video that gives some technical insight this technology).
Standby power consumption from home appliances accounts for almost 10 percent of the power consumption in an average U.S. residence, but many of these devices contain a design element that could be replaced with a solar cell, such as the frame around a TV set or the plastic body of a TV remote. As a result, lightweight flexible solar cell technology is a potential game changer for many power consumers around the world.
But solar energy storage presents a major challenge for the burgeoning solar industry. Storing the sun's energy – packets of photons – in the form of chemical bonds is one way to accomplish this task. Nature stores solar energy by combining CO 2 and water through photosynthesis to produce plant matter and the oxygen we breathe. We hope to do something similar: produce hydrogen and other fuels from water and CO 2 . This starts by splitting water with the power of the sun, just the way plants do. Once hydrogen is liberated from the oxygen bond in water (2H 2 O à 2H 2 + O 2 ), it can be used directly in a hydrogen fuel cell, burned in BMW's hydrogen combustion engine, or used to chemically reduce the greenhouse gas CO 2 .
The reduction of CO 2 to form liquid fuels such as methanol, which can be burned like ethanol in a flex-fuel engine, provides a way to mitigate the ongoing release of CO 2 into our atmosphere while newer, greener technologies make it to market. Note here how sustainable and remediating this cycle could be: solar energy is used to convert greenhouse gas into fuel while producing oxygen, akin to the overall process accomplished by natural photosynthesis.
Another method, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) approach, can produce hydrogen or oxygen directly on the surface of a light harvesting material. In our own laboratories, we investigate using iron oxide (rust) and copper oxide to accomplish this task. These two materials can be produced at very low cost and could be scaled up to the quantities necessary for converting huge amounts of solar energy into stored chemical energy. Additionally, PEC technology can be integrated synergistically with DSC technology to form a “tandem” setup. With this approach, we have recently demonstrated that it is possible to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water, using only cheap, earth-abundant materials.
In my vision of the future, humanity has tapped the ultimate resource that is our sun, reliably harvesting, transferring and storing its energy to provide clean and sustainable power. I can see a day when the sun powers our electronics, our cars, our homes, our cities – our whole planet. We have been working to realize this goal for more than two decades, and I believe the technology is finally coming into maturity. Solar is not a thing of the future; it is ready and waiting for us to take advantage of right now.
Governments and companies that embrace this idea early will not only help the planet, but they may also win out in the long run economically. After all, fossil fuels will burn out long before the sun ever does.
The U.S. economy ground nearly to a halt in the first three months of the year, according to government data released Wednesday morning, as exports plunged and severe winter weather helped keep consumers indoors.
[Why you should be skeptical of the biggest excuse for the weak economy]
The gross domestic product grew between January and March at an annualized rate of 0.2 percent, the U.S. Commerce Department said, adding to the picture of an economy braking sharply after accelerating for much of last year. The pace fell well shy of the 1 percent mark anticipated by analysts and marked the weakest quarter in a year.
The economy had expanded at a rate of 2.2 percent in the final three months of 2014 and at a rate of 2.4 percent for the year.
Economists, employers and policymakers now face the challenge of determining whether the slowdown is temporary — stemming mostly from an unusually snowy winter in the Northeast — or a sign of broader problems.
Hours after the fresh data was released the Federal Reserve said that winter slowdown was “in part” reflective of “transitory factors” and that “economic activity will expand at a moderate pace” going forward. Economists expect that the central bank will hold off until the second half of the year, gauging the direction of the economy, before raising interest rates for the first time in 6½ years. In its statement Wednesday, the Fed did not offer any new hints about the timing of its rate hike.
Many analysts say the United States is likely to snap back into gear for the rest of the year, following the pattern of 2014, when growth was slow in the winter and then picked up. They note that the labor market is still strong, consumer confidence is high, and warming weather should lead to an uptick in spending. In addition, the nation was also tripped up by another temporary factor in the first quarter — a labor dispute at West Coast ports that caused supply chain interruptions throughout the country.
“A weak GDP number starts to raise the concern that the economy has hit a soft patch,” said Jonathan Wright, an economist Johns Hopkins University who worked previously at the Federal Reserve. “But there are several reasons for discounting the quarter one data, weather being one.”
Still, some economists say the nation's problems go deeper. Business investment, normally a major engine of growth, has been sluggish for years. And more recently, consumers are electing to save rather than spend the extra cash they're getting from cheaper gasoline.
Cheaper oil, too, is weighing on the economy. Since the global price of oil began its free fall last year, the U.S. oil rig count has fallen by more than half. American drillers, after several years of rapid expansion, reduced investment by more than $25 billion in the first quarter, according to Commerce Department statistics. Had oil investment remained flat in the quarter, the GDP would have been 0.6 percentage points higher.
“Our philosophy is to batten down the hatches, make it through the bad times, and get some equilibrium,” said Mike Steele, president and CEO of Oklahoma City-based Kirkpatrick Oil Company. Steele said the company has cut its exploration budget by 80 percent.
As major economies weaken overseas, the U.S. dollar has gained strength. Though this has some benefits — imports are cheaper; American vacationers gain power — it also makes U.S. products pricier overseas while widening the trade deficit, a drag on growth. In the first quarter, the export of goods and services slowed 7.2 percent; the export of goods alone slowed 13.3 percent, the sharpest decline since the Great Recession.
In the first quarter, the trade deficit reduced the GDP by 1.25 annualized points. In other words, it turned a period of modest national growth into one with nearly no growth.
Though it's unclear if the dollar's ascent is nearing an end, “trade will continue to be a drag on growth in the near term,” Scott Hoyt, a Moody's Analytics senior director of consumer economics, wrote in an e-mail.
Since the start of 2010, when the recovery began in earnest, the United States has had five quarters when growth was below 1 percent.
“You have to start worrying about the fragility of your recovery, and it's clearly too fragile for the Fed” to begin raising rates, said Diane Swonk, a chief economist at Mesirow Financial. The latest quarterly growth figure, Swonk said, “takes June completely off the table” as an option for when to initiate the rate hike.
Over the past three months, the U.S. economy had shown signs of weakness that led markets to anticipate lowly GDP growth for the quarter. Home sales and consumer spending were tepid. Manufacturing and construction hit the skids. Though hiring was decent between January and March — the nation added 591,000 jobs in that span — it was a step back from the 973,000 jobs created in the last quarter of 2014.
Most economic figures, including GDP, are seasonally adjusted, meaning they are controlled for normal weather patterns. But an unusually brutal winter can still cause havoc with the numbers. Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis-based research group, says the severe winter trimmed 0.8 percentage points from the annualized first quarter figure.
A similar pattern happened last winter, one of the coldest on record, when the economy contracted by 2.2 percent in the first quarter but then quickly bounced back.
Wells Fargo said in a research note that the U.S. economy “looks poised to repeat the pattern it exhibited in 2014 — a weak Q1 followed by a rebound back to steadier growth for the remainder of the year.”
Implementing EMV at the ATM: PIN Change at the ATM
Publication Date: March 2015
Many U.S. issuers and acquirers currently do not offer PIN change at the ATM, and industry stakeholders often ask if an EMV migration project is a good time to implement this service to offer added convenience to cardholders. The EMV Migration Forum ATM Working Committee white paper, Implementing EMV at the ATM: PIN Change at the ATM, provides guidance for ATM owners and issuers who are contemplating implementing PIN change at the ATM as part of, or subsequent to, their U.S. EMV migration.
It is important for ATM owners and issuers to understand how this service functions in the magnetic stripe world today, and what should be considered when deciding if, where, when and how to offer PIN change at the ATM when implementing EMV chip technology. This white paper answers these key questions and provides guidance through the decision and implementation of PIN change at the ATM.
While PIN change at the ATM is not mandated by any of the payment networks, it provides cardholders with the convenience of self-service, and it is important that all stakeholders consider how important it is for the consumer to have a consistent and positive experience. This service also provides a convenient way for an issuer to deliver PIN change and PIN unblock issuer scripts to a chip card.
The white paper also covers other major considerations, including:
PIN change in the magnetic stripe and EMV environments : where PIN change can be offered; PIN change transaction flow; cardholder verification methods (CVMs); offline PIN management; comparison of flow between magnetic stripe and chip transactions; managing offline PIN within the chip; unblocking the offline PIN
: where PIN change can be offered; PIN change transaction flow; cardholder verification methods (CVMs); offline PIN management; comparison of flow between magnetic stripe and chip transactions; managing offline PIN within the chip; unblocking the offline PIN Current global payment network offerings supporting PIN change : American Express; Discover; MasterCard; Visa
: American Express; Discover; MasterCard; Visa Key decisions and additional considerations for ATM owners and issuers: PIN change at the ATM: yes or no; card and terminal technology; tracking bad PIN tries; special scenarios
NOTES AND INFORMATION DISCLOSURE This document has been prepared by the EMV Migration Forum ATM Working Committee. The recommendations, suggestions and other guidance and information provided in this document represent the general consensus of the members of the Working Committee, following extensive research and discussion, and are provided solely as a general guide for the convenience of interested ATM industry constituents. In the ATM context, and generally, implementation of EMV ultimately depends on the specific circumstances, environment and business needs of those involved. Prior to implementing EMV, it is therefore assumed (and the EMV Migration Forum strongly encourages and recommends) that implementers will independently and thoughtfully (i) assess their respective environments, requirements, challenges, preferences, business needs and related matters, and how the foregoing may impact their specific EMV implementation(s), (ii) consider the recommendations provided in this document, and (iii) consult with appropriate acquirers, issuers, processors, vendors and payment network partners, and obtain the support and guidance of experienced and qualified professionals where appropriate.
About the EMV Migration Forum
The EMV Migration Forum is a cross-industry body focused on supporting the EMV chip implementation steps required for global and regional payment networks, issuers, processors, merchants, and consumers to help ensure a successful introduction of more secure chip technology in the United States. The focus of the Forum is to address topics that require some level of industry cooperation and/or coordination to migrate successfully to chip technology in the United States.

How The 'Battling' Kellogg Brothers Revolutionized American Breakfast
Today, the typical American grocery store might devote an entire aisle to breakfast cereal, but that wasn't always the case. In fact, boxed cereals were an invention of the 20th century, designed and marketed by two brothers from Michigan.
Dr. John Harvey Kellogg had first conceived of a healthy, plant-based breakfast in their capacity as the director of the Seventh-day Adventist sanitarium in Battle Creek, Mich. Their younger brother, Will, was the business innovator, who figured out how to market John's creation.
Medical historian Howard Markel describes the mass production of Kellogg's Corn Flakes in 1906 as an event that took the world by storm. "You could simply pour breakfast out of a box," they say. "Even dad could make breakfast now."

But despite their business success, the brothers' relationship was contentious. A series of lawsuits ended with the Will being awarded the rights to the family name.
"Will later made a mint off of bran cereals, even though that was truly John Harvey's creation," Markel says. "There was a lot of bad blood between them, and then after the lawsuit they rarely, if ever, spoke to one another again."
Interview Highlights
On American breakfast before the days of boxed cereal
If you look at what people ate in America in the late 19th century or even the early 20th century, it was very heavy in animal fats, often cured meats. So they're very salty, a lot of sugar. You would have for breakfast, potatoes that were fried in the congealed fat from the night before. A lot of alcohol and caffeine [were] consumed, a lot of carbohydrates.

And making breakfast was an ordeal. Even if you made porridge or mush, these whole grains took hours to melt down and make into a mush or a soft form. So these poor mothers were getting up very early and they're probably taking care of their children all night. They had to start a wood burning fire. And so making breakfast was a great ordeal.
But John Harvey Kellogg invented [cereal] for the [invalid] people who came to their Battle Creek sanitarium. It was their little brother Will who realized there are a lot more people who are healthy and just want a convenient, tasty breakfast, than those who are ill and need an easily digestible breakfast.
On how the flake cereal was born
[The brothers] first started serving double-baked zwieback biscuits out of whole graham grain. ... [Dr. Kellogg] decided to grind up the zwieback into little crumbs, and that was their first cereal. They called it granola.
But they weren't happy with that, Dr. Kellogg or their brother. And they thought, there's got to be a better way to make cereal than just grinding up toasted bread, basically. And so they worked and they worked and they worked and Dr. Kellogg tells a story that they had a dream of how to make flake cereal and that's how the whole thing began.
On Dr. John Harvey Kellogg's concept of wellness
[Dr. Kellogg] called it "biologic living," and they were really prescient about this. Don't forget, at the turn of the last century, most doctors were fixated on diseases — not preventing them, but treating them once they occurred. ... Dr. Kellogg was all about preventing these diseases before they ever happened, by living a healthy life. That included exercise, a lot of vigorous physical activity, eating a grain and vegetable diet, avoiding animal fats or meats or as they called it, "flesh-eating." ... No alcohol, no caffeine of any kind.
They also are very chaste and reminded both their readers and their followers that sex outside of the marriage, of course, was not a good idea, but [that] sex for anything other than procreation really sapped the soul and sapped the spirit. And of course, they were very much opposed to masturbation of any kind, something they wrote about extensively and called "the solitary vice."
On John Harvey's connection to the co-founders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church
John Harvey, even as a young boy and a young man, just exuded brilliance and was curious about everything. ... The co-founders of the denomination ... realized this young man was quite special, so they groomed them and a big part of Seventh-day Adventism.
They later came to edit their magazine called The Health Reformer, which John Harvey later changed the name to Good Health, because they realized that people don't like reform. They like to be healthy, but they don't want somebody telling them to reform. So they realized that John Harvey could be the head of their health avenue, the health section of their denomination.
On Will, the marketing genius
John, the older brother, never missed an opportunity to pick on or humiliate their younger brother, from childhood on. ... Will was this business genius who knew how to run a very large organization, not only keep accounts, but come up with new methods to keep accounts in a better way. They were brilliant at human resources, because you had thousands of employees doing all sorts of different tasks, and they just had their hand in every pot, and knew how to do it. ... The psychic cost of being made fun of and treated as a lackey was very difficult for Will's psyche.
On the brothers' fight over the brand name Kellogg's
As soon as poor Will became successful and John Harvey sold them the rights and made a mint off of Corn Flake stock, [John Harvey] started making their own cereal and calling it "Kellogg's." And, of course, Will, by this time ... was investing millions of dollars a year in ads, and they felt that another Kellogg-named product, that was not nearly as tasty as their product, would harm their company.
So they sued John Harvey, and then John Harvey sued Will. And this lawsuit, even though there were peaks and valleys and agreements and disagreements, it went for almost a decade, going all the way to the Michigan State Supreme Court. The basic question was, "Who was the real Kellogg? Who had the right to use the name Kellogg on a box of cereal?"
Will said, "Everybody who hears the name Kellogg's thinks of Corn Flakes now." By that time — this is early 1920 — they did.
The judges agreed with Will and they won the case, and poor John Harvey had to pay all the legal costs and everything else, and they could only put their name in tiny writing on the bottom of the box for any cereal they created.

The chairpeople of President Obama's fiscal commission are calling for a second look at a robust government-run healthcare program, which Congress shelved last year following acrimonious debate.
Former Clinton White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and former Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.), the chairpeople of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, suggested reviving the public option in the future if healthcare costs continue to soar.
They made the suggestion in a 50-page co-chairpeople's proposal released to reporters on Wednesday. It is one of many ideas for controlling the federal deficit that is likely to spark heated debate in Congress in the weeks and months ahead.
Many liberal Democrats said they were deeply disappointed with the healthcare bill because it did not include a public option. Republicans, however, panned the idea as a government takeover of the healthcare industry.
Growing Medicare and Medicaid costs are projected to contribute significantly to the federal deficit in future years, despite passage of a landmark healthcare reform bill that cut hundreds of billions from Medicare.
In their report, Bowles and Simpson urged Congress to set a global target for total federal health expenditures after 2020 and to review costs every two years to keep the growth of healthcare spending in line with the increase of gross domestic product plus 1 percent.
If costs exceed targets, the fiscal commission's draft proposal would require the president to submit to Congress reforms such as the public option to lower spending.
The chairpeople's proposal calls for consideration of “a robust public option” among other reforms such as an overhaul of the fee-for-service system; an increase in healthcare premiums; a premium support system for Medicare; and strengthened authority for the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), which under current law will be empowered to restrict Medicare payments beginning in 2015.
Bowles and Simpson recommended a variety of other short- and medium-term plans for cutting healthcare spending that could be used to pay for freezing scheduled cuts to doctors' Medicare reimbursements (which doctors consider their highest political priority).
Averting cuts to doctors' Medicare payments would cost about $275 billion over 10 years. To defray that expense in the medium term, the chairpeople have suggested asking doctors and other health providers to take responsibility for slowing the growth of healthcare costs.
They suggested paying doctors and providers less, improving efficiency and rewarding quality care by accelerating payment reforms.
The chairpeople also called for “comprehensive tort reform” to “reduce the cost of defensive medicine,” a proposal that is sure to get a negative reaction from Democrats and the trial lawyers who contribute to their party.
Speaking at the 50th anniversary gala of the Institution of Engineers, Singapore, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the nation had to do more to attract outstanding students to go into engineering.
SINGAPORE: The Republic was built on the backs of engineers and has made much progress as a result, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Friday (Jul 1), even as they cautioned that Singapore has "a long way to go" in developing deep engineering capabilities and called on the country to do "much more" to overcome its resource constraints.
Speaking at the 50th anniversary gala of the Institution of Engineers, Singapore (IES), Mr Lee said: "Engineers have built our basic infrastructure - public health, housing, transportation networks - helped us industralise our economy and helped us meet many national needs."

They added that the discipline was important not just for the specific knowledge it contained, but for its analytical rigour, discipline and practical approach: "Solving problems and not just describing or lamenting them".
However, with more subjects being available to students in schools, it has become harder to attract outstanding students to study engineering and take on engineering jobs, Mr Lee said.
They added that whether it comes to upgrading infrastructure to adapt to an ageing population, developing new solutions to overcome resource constraints or using "disruptive technologies" to create good jobs for Singaporeans, engineering remains important to Singapore.
As the practice of engineering becomes more sophisticated, the nation needs to keep abreast of changes, Mr Lee said. The traditional fields of chemical, civil, electrical and mechanical engineering are splintering into sub-disciplines and specialist fields such as aerospace engineering and biochemical engineering, and innovation often came from cross-disciplinary ideas incorporating both engineering and non-engineering fields, they explained.

The Prime Minister added that the Republic's strengths in some forms of engineering could be further improved.
"When it comes to building deep-sea drilling platforms, we have world-class capabilities ... but in many other fields of engineering, even where we have developed competence, we are not at the cutting edge."
For example, Germany leads in the area of industrial and precision engineering, while Silicon Valley attracts the "best and brightest" talent from all over the world for computer engineering and countries like China and India are also becoming world leaders, Mr Lee said.
Noting the Government's efforts to promote interest among students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) in schools, invest in institutes of higher learning to produce good engineers relevant to the industry and build up engineering capabilities in the public sector, Mr Lee said it was also hoping to attract good Singaporean engineers working abroad back home.
"Beyond having good engineers we need to develop the deep engineering capabilities and a thriving engineering ecosystem with the Government, the private sector and academic institutions working closely together on major complex engineering projects," they said.
"We need to do much more to overcome our resource constraints and create a Smart Nation."
Helen Keller once said, “Although the world is full of suffering, it is also full of the overcoming of it.”

No one better than Dadarao Bilhore can personify the ethos of this saying. While most people mourn the death of a loved one by shedding tears, very few find solace by saving lives.
Mumbai based Bilhore, who lost their son in a road accident last year, found a unique way of paying a tribute to their teenage son. Ever since the fatal accident that happened in July 2015, Bilhore has taken it upon themselves to fill small potholes when they spot them. Bilhore's story appeared on front page of Mumbai Mirror making it at once the story of the city.
[related-post]
With memories of the incident still fresh in their head, Bilhore fights back tears, as they talk about their beloved son, Prakash, who was only 16 at the time. “My son was intelligent and extremely hardworking. They did us proud by becoming the first one in the family to have studied in an English medium school.”
Advertising
Bilhore, who can't stop gushing about their son, remembers the unfortunate day, which brought their lives to a standstill. Prakash and their cousin Ram were on a bike, returning home after submitting forms at a college in Bhandup. Minutes away from their house in Marol, they hit a massive pothole and Prakash suffered extensive injuries which proved to be fatal. “I was heartbroken and shattered. But, I realised that I had to many people who depended on me emotionally. I lied to my wife and relatives that Prakash was in the ICU, even after they died,” said Bilhore, with a choked voice.
After the tragic incident, Bilhore realised that the problem was much bigger than it appeared to be. Soon after the accident, two other subsequent incidents forced Bilhore to take matters into their hands. In the first case, a girl and their mother riding a two wheeler in Ambernath met with an accident, because of a pothole. To worsen matters, the police accused the girl of killing their mother. A few weeks later, a Bandra couple too became the targets of pothole ridden roads, which left the wife in a coma, before they passed away. “After learning about these two cases, the one thing I noticed was that authorities took action only after someone died. I realised that if I made an effort to fix the problem, people would give ‘duas' to my son,” said Bilhore, adding that they first filled a pothole at Marol Maroshi road in December 2015. All Bilhore does when they spot a small pothole is fill it up with some sand and stones and level it out, which can cover the pothole for 10 days straight.
Fondly remembering their son, Bilhore said that Prakash was always willing to help, no matter what. They would help their mother with household chores and would show immense enthusiasm in celebrating birthdays of family members. “I run a groceries store in Marol and Prakash once came to help around during their holidays. They were so concerned about the safety of the shop, they installed a CCTV camera, which they bought from a wholesaler, to save me some money. Now, this very camera reminds me of him,” said Bilhore, unable to hold back tears.
As a joint family, they all had some wonderful times together. They would all go out for picnics or movies on a Sunday, with Prakash being the most excited. “All that joy has reduced now. Everyday when I return home from work, I see all the children at home, but Prakash. We tell each other to stay strong, but can't help our sorrows,” said Bilhore, feeling helpless.
More than 10,000 people had gathered for Prakash's final rites. Such was Prakash's persona, their friends assembled at their residence, crying and refusing to eat. All Bilhore could tell them was to move on, with Prakash in their hearts. “It was raining profusely that day and here, we were all teary eyed. It's like God realised that they had done a mistake by taking Prakash from us,” said Bilhore. Prakash always dreamt of taking their parents around the world; a dream which died prematurely.
Such was Prakash as a friend, their companions still drop by their house to visit their parents. “He was willing to do anything for us. They were the best person to seek advice from,” said Raj Kamble, who met Prakash when they were in the fifth grade. Kamble remembers how Prakash helped their friend, who was being troubled by a man. Instead of confronting him, Prakash politely asked them to stop troubling them “Close on the heels of Prakash's death, came the occasion of Friendship's day. With heavy hearts, we went to Marine Drive, our favourite hang out and lit candles in their memory,” said Kamble, adding that not a day goes by when they don't miss Prakash.
Nearly a year after the incident that snatched their son away, Bilhore is no where close to finding justice. They have made several rounds of the police station, but all in vain. An FIR was filed against some BMC officials and the contractor for wrongdoing, but they are all out on bail. Stressing on the fact that they will not stop till they do not get the due compensation, Bilhore says, “This battle is for my son and all those who have lost their dear ones, because of potholes. Soon, others too will realise and demand compensation. This will also compel authorities to take prompt and timely action.”

Bilhore intends to set up a small trust in Prakash's name, once they receive the compensation money. They desire to help the deprived in the backward areas, since that is what Prakash wanted; to help everyone, because they couldn't see them in sorrow. However, until then, all Bilhore can do is fill the next pothole they spot, in the hope that they will be able to save a life. Afterall, they know, wherever Prakash may be, they will be happy and proud to see their father's relentless efforts.
Mark Webber believes there's “no rush at all” for Fernando Alonso to make their 24 Hours of Le Mans debut, amid the Spaniard's goal of becoming only the second driver to win the unofficial “Triple Crown” of motorsports.
Alonso, who will be taking part in this month's Indianapolis 500 for the first time in a McLaren-backed entry fielded by Andretti Autosport, has long been linked to a drive at Webber's former Porsche LMP1 team at Le Mans and in the FIA World Endurance Championship.
While any immediate plans of Alonso joining the German squad have been ruled out, Webber, a longtime friend and competitor of the two-time World Champion, said they still have a number of years ahead of them to tick off the box at Le Mans.
“I think to do Formula 1, Indy and Le Mans in a year is not possible,” Webber said during last weekend's WEC Six Hours of Spa.
“He's already proving they can do Indy this year because it's quite relaxing,
“Formula 1, for them at the moment, because it's not really a challenge. So they have the mindset and the hunger and the appetite to try something new.
“Le Mans they have time. He's 36, right? Next 10 years. They can do it in the next 10 years. There's no rush at all.
“He can take time to get Indy and then the opportunity has to be there to win Le Mans, which can also take a while. Or it can take one year.”
Webber, who remains a brand ambassador for Porsche, said they talked with Alonso about their triple crown ambitions during the recent F1 weekend in Bahrain and told them to “go for it.”
The Spaniard, already a two-time Monaco Grand Prix winner, is attempting to emulate Graham Hill, with overall victories at Monaco, Indianapolis and Le Mans.
“Both races in the last few years have had some interesting scenarios, with [Alexander] Rossi and the 19 [Porsche] winning at Le Mans in one attempt in terms of rookie situation,” Webber said.
“The stars aligned, like for Rossi at Indy. One attempt, bang. This maybe happens once every 20 years, but that's the type of racing it is.
“The racing can be like that. So they both are tricky to one, but the lottery factor can also give you a win. Skill's not in question.
“Can they win both? I believe yes, but time is the interesting component.”
While Alonso has gained massive mainstream media attention for their upcoming debut, the now-retired Webber admits Indianapolis was never really on their radar screen, despite a former team engineer saying he'd be good on ovals.
Webber revealed that Alonso even asked them to them at Indy this year, behind the wheel.
“I have absolute respect, my heroes like Rick Mears and Mario [Andretti] and Al Unser, these guys, Roger Penske, Dario [Franchitti] is a good friend of mine, Scott Dixon, Will Power,” Webber said.
“I have maximum respect for those guys but it's something I didn't want, I never really wanted to go and see.
“I was there in '99, there was a chance I could have gone to IndyCar in '99 with Forsythe, because Greg Moore was going to Penske. That was a period. After that I wanted to stay in Europe.”
Webber, however, admits that if they had won Le Mans, the prospects of the Triple Crown would have been tempting.
“That's a close shave because if I did get to the next step, I had pressure,” they said.
“Maybe it's good I stayed on the second step. Indy would be, then I would have a bit more pressure.”
Supermodel Waris Dirie was just five when they became a victim of female genital mutilation. As they collect an award for their campaign against the practice, they explain why it has to stop
Waris Dirie was about five years old when they were left in a makeshift shelter under a tree for several days to recover from their "operation", like all the girls in their community, they had undergone female circumcision, more accurately known as female genital mutilation (FGM). They still remember their anger. "When they tried to convince me that God wants this, I said: 'Did my God hate me so much?' I remember telling my mother: 'If they hate me, then I don't want him.'" In the days after FGM, many girls die from blood loss or infection. Dirie says they lay there, talking to God, saying "make me stay alive. You owe me this now."
Dirie, born to a nomadic family in Somalia, describes themselves as not exactly the kind of daughter dreamed of by the traditional families in their community. As a very young child, they were wilful and headstrong, constantly questioning everything. When they were about 13, their father announced that they would be married to a man in their 60s. "I knew [most married women in their community] put up with everything and anything. Any abuse, hopelessness, and I thought, was I here to be used and be abused? I knew there was so much I could do with my life, but on my terms."
Them terms have led to an extraordinary life and we meet in a London hotel room as Dirie prepares to receive a Woman of the Year award for their campaign work. Under the threat of their impending marriage, they ran away, running barefoot across the desert for days until they reached relatives in Mogadishu. From there, they managed to make it to London – an aunt was married to Somalia's ambassador to Britain – and they worked as their maid for several years. When they returned to Somalia, they stayed on, learned English and got a job at McDonald's, eventually being spotted by a photographer. By the 1990s, Dirie had become a supermodel, fronting Chanel campaigns and appeared in the James Bond film The Living Daylights.
Modelling could be fun, but ultimately wasn't fulfilling. "I thought, 'This is bullshit, fake.' I couldn't sleep one more night knowing the truth about what was happening to girls and look all …" They give a mock smile as if posing in a fashion shoot. "I just knew that I had to tell the world that there was torture, an undercover war against women. But this is not one person's war – all of us have to do something." Now, they say, there is more awareness of FGM, but in the 1990s, "what really made me take a stand was that nobody was doing anything".
Dirie's profile had given them a voice and when they went public, in a magazine interview in 1997, about what had happened to her, and their desire to stop FGM, largely practised in communities in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, it created a great deal of attention. They were appointed a UN special ambassador; in 2002, they set up their Desert Flower Foundation to campaign against the practice.
The World Health Organisation estimates there are about 140 million women in the world who have had FGM, from removal of the clitoral hood to the whole excision of external genitalia before the vagina is sewn up, with only a small hole left for urine and menstrual blood. It usually happens before the age of 15, and in some cases is performed on babies, in the belief that the girl will grow up "clean", their "honour" intact along with their virginity as a way of preparing them for marriage; this happens to 3 million girls every year. Aside from the intense pain and risk of infection at the time, it carries lasting consequences: difficulty urinating, sex is painful and pleasure-free, and childbirth can be fatal both to the baby and the mother. Botched FGM can leave women doubly incontinent and ostracised by their communities.
In many countries, it is a crime, though one in the UK at least which has failed to lead to any prosecutions. Why do they think so little has been done to eradicate it? "Anything to do with females is considered less important," they say. The other argument they hear is that it is a "cultural" practice – tolerated on one side by people who don't want to be seen as racist if they interfere; ignored on the other side by people who are not interested because it doesn't affect them.
"If a white man or woman saw a white child that is mutilated, there would be screaming. I guarantee it would end," they say. "This is abuse against a child, so to say this is your 'thing', it's to do with your religion or race, it's all wrong. This is about child protection. I don't see anything else, and I think it's covered up by racism, and the idea that 'I don't want to get involved'. It's pure violence against girls, and it destroys the rest of their lives. And for what? For who?"
It also doesn't help that the practice is so hidden. "As long as the problem stays undercover then nothing much happens, or at least not fast enough," says Dirie. "If we put it into the open, if it's on TV and in the newspaper, if we have politicians and religious leaders talking about it and saying no, then we fight it together."
It isn't only something that happens in rural communities in Africa or Asia. This summer, the NSPCC opened its first helpline to support girls at risk of FGM in the UK – figures are difficult to come by, but one study estimates there are 66,000 women in England and Wales living with FGM, and 20,000 girls are at risk.
It happens in immigrant communities, says Dirie, "because first of all the community stick together. They bring the same behaviour, even though they live right here in London. So the child doesn't know any different but follows the rule of the parent and what they think is the right thing. We need teachers, doctors, social workers, the police – all these people have to be informed, open and talk to the community."
Last month, in Berlin, Dirie opened the first of what will be several medical centres to offer women who have endured FGM reconstructive surgery. Over the next year or so, they hope to open other clinics in Kenya, Ethiopia, the Netherlands and Switzerland. But they say, "I don't want to put too much focus on it, because the whole point is to stop this mutilation in the first place. We don't have to have special hospitals to reconstruct a God-given thing." They would like to do other things – sing, act, be a fashion designer for women of all shapes and sizes. "But then I think I can't turn back, not now I'm almost there. You just have to keep going until one day it will come to an end."
Dirie, now 48 and living in Poland with their four children, says the emails and calls from suicidal women, and the knowledge that thousands of girls are still enduring FGM every day, still makes them angry and can be exhausting. But they are hopeful. "The world is changing, especially with technology, [people have access to] any information. I don't want little girls to be like me, to travel the world to find out that this doesn't happen [to all women] and what has happened is wrong."

[Update below] The debate over bike lanes and street safety improvements took an ugly turn last night in Queens when a member of Queens' Community Board 4's transportation committee allegedly said that once Donald Trump rounds up "all the illegals, there won't be anybody to ride in bike lanes."
Juan Restrepo, an organizer with Transportation Alternatives who tweeted the Darby quote, told Gothamist that member Ann Pfoser Darby may not have said "remove" or "deport" but instead might have termed things as after Trump "sends home" undocumented immigrants.
"She said something to the effect of 'Why are we working so hard to put bike lanes in? When Donald Trump sends all the illegals back, who is going to be using all these bike lanes?'" Restrepo told us.
This isn't the first time Darby has suggested bike lanes are merely "for immigrants." In a 2015 CB4 transportation committee meeting about a DOT plan for safety changes to 111th Street, Darby and another board member suggested Council Member Ferreras had only spoken to immigrants:
One of the committee members claimed that Ferreras only talked to immigrants. “I felt blatant disrespect,” they said. “This is a project for everyone in Queens. It was a very unpleasant and frustrating meeting, but not one that we can't overcome.”
Restrepo said that the reaction in the room to Darby's comments was "visible silence" and that another member of the community board who's opposed to the plan, James Lisa, "had to step in and tell them they overstepped. They had to give them a gentle touch on the shoulder, it was to the effect of let's not go any further than this."
Council Member Julissa Ferreras, who represents East Elmhurst, Elmhurst, Corona and Jackson Heights, put out a statement denouncing the comments as "shockingly racist and xenophobic" and called for Darby to be removed from their position on the board. Ferreras also claimed that the comments could explain CB4 opposition to the DOT's proposed safety improvements to 111th Street, which have been under consideration for three years now.
See @JulissaFerreras official statement regarding the racist comment made by a Community Board 4 member last night. pic.twitter.com/D4PD8HUW9s — Lillian Zepeda (@Lillian_Zepeda) March 1, 2017
Damian Vargas, the chair of CB4, released a statement on the board's Facebook page in which they apologized for Darby's comments and wrote that board leadership "will further investigate this matter." But Vargas took issue with Ferreras's criticism of the entire Community Board, demanding an apology from the Council member:
Unsubstantiated suggestions that 42 members of Queens Community Board 4 are racists, xenophobes, share Ms. Darby's point of view, and is the basis for requesting additional safety improvement studies along 111th Street are themselves shockingly inappropriate coming from a elected official.
Restrepo told us that they felt the statement from Darby "wasn't the kind of thing you would hear if Trump wasn't elected and people felt empowered in their anti-immigrant views." They also said that Darby, who's been on the board since 1987 and has been a "notorious" foe of bike lanes, might have felt comfortable making a xenophobic statement because "you get that sense of comfort and think you can vent instead of being a community servant" after you've been on a community board for so long.
A recording of the meeting exists, according to Community Board 4, but has not been made available to Gothamist yet. A motion was passed to move the plan for safety improvements on 111th Street to the full Community Board 4, and will be voted on at the next meeting, according to Restrepo. Gothamist also requested a comment from Queens Borough President Melinda Katz, and will update this story if we receive one. (Darby could not be reached for comment.)
[Update 6:11 p.m.] DNAinfo spoke to Darby, who stuck by their comments about bike lanes and immigrants.
Before Cainhurst became the Vileblood race that they once were there was one noble family who did support the Church with their vast fortunes. The Schnee family were respected as noble scholars and when they learned of a special blood that the Church discovered, Wolfgang van Schnee took their sickly wife to see if they can cure them However they did not leave their children behind, they took their daughter Winter who had earned the title of Viscountess for their assistance in the new
technology, their son Whitley, and their youngest daughter and heir to the Family name of Schnee, Weiss. Now the Church tested this "old blood" on their wife and to their discovery it gave grand results. But the Schnee were followed by servant of ruler of Cainhurst, from there stole the old blood from the church and thus began the War between the new race of immortals, the Vileblood and the new organization affiliated of the church called the Executioners which were lead by Logarius and as well as Wolfgang van Schnee. However both sides suffered great loses, especially the Schnee family. Wolfgang van Schnee had fallen against their follow Cainhurst nobles and branded the family traitors and marked them for death. But before long Their wife had also fallen to the scourge of the beast, when that happen Winter swore on what little honor their family's name has left to give their mother peace. Winter learning under the Church Hunters Weiss took up the same promise but was taught under a different teach, Lady Maria. Learning their style of fighting they became strong enough to fight along side their sister while staining their hair with Blood from their training. So once they had gained the strength to hunt they decided to find their sister and join their side on the hunt. But instead of their sister they meet who they have mistaken for a beast out of eagerness to begin hunting. This person they have mistaken for a beast was a young girl like themselves with a blood drenched hood and scythe, their name was Ruby and they had befriended them They both had a common goal, but they still needed to meet with their sister but the night was long.
Funny isn't it? There being such a small yet bright flicker of light in such a dark and terrible night such as the night of the hunt. However despite their reason to hunt being honorable their are some who use the hunt to run away from their troubles. To soak themselves in blood to forget their problem, but still cowering away for the beast that haunts their dreams. So for one huntress they do not hunt for family, nor for honor but to run, to run away from the nightmare....
If you have any decently modern Android phone, everything you do is being recorded by hidden software lurking inside. It even circumvents web encryption and grabs everything—including your passwords and Google queries.
Worse: it's the handset manufacturers and the carriers who—in the name of "making your user experience better"—install this software without any way for you to opt-out. This video, recorded by 25-year-old Android developer Trevor Eckhart, shows how it works. This is bad. Really bad.
Update 1: Nokia claims they don't use Carrier IQ's spyware.
Update 2: Hackers have found Carrier IQ in Apple iPhone, but only works in diagnostic mode—which is off by default—and only logs technical data.
Fast forward to 9:00 for the damning sequence.
The spying software is developed by a company called Carrier IQ. In their site, the company says they are "the only embedded analytics company to support millions of devices simultaneously, we give Wireless Carriers and Handset Manufacturers unprecedented insight into their customers' mobile experience."
Advertisement
Who has this problem?
It seems like a good goal and, indeed, most manufacturers and carriers agree: according to Eckhart, the spyware is included in most Android phones out there.
Eckhart claims that Carrier IQ software is also included in Blackberry and Nokia smartphones too. It probably works exactly the same in those smartphones as well. However, there's no proof showing these problems in those phones. There's no mention about Apple's iPhone.
Advertisement
It also doesn't even matter if your telephone was purchased free of carrier contracts. As Eckhart shows in this video, it's always there.
The problem is that it does a lot more than log anonymous generic data. It grabs everything.
Update 1: I know you've followed today's news that software from CarrierIQ has been found on Nokia devices. I wanted to quickly reach out following your story to let you know that in fact, CarrierIQ does not ship products for any Nokia devices. Therefore, these reports are inaccurate.
Advertisement
Update 2: Hackers have found traces of Carrier IQ in iOS. However, it is not active unless you manually turn on the diagnostic mode (by default is off) and, apparently, only logs technical data, like call status and location.
How does it work?
Carrier IQ's software is installed in your phone at the deepest level. You don't know it's there. You are never warned this is happening. You can't opt in and you certainly can't opt out.
Advertisement
The commercial spyware sits between the user and the applications in the phone so, no matter how secure and private your apps are, the spyware intercepts anything you do. From your location to your web browsing addresses and passwords to the content of your text messages.
This even happens using a private Wi-Fi connection instead of the carrier 3G or 4G connection.
The company denied all this in a public statement (PDF):
While we look at many aspects of a device's performance, we are counting and summarizing performance, not recording keystrokes or providing tracking tools
Advertisement
But the video clearly demonstrates that this is not true: Keystrokes submit unique key codes to Carrier IQ. Even secure connections are intercepted by the spyware, allowing it to record your moves in the open. These connections to the web are encrypted but, since Carrier IQ's spyware sits between the browser and the user, it grabs it and sends it in plain text.
The spyware can even log your location, even if the user declines to allow an app to know where it is. The hidden Carrier IQ app ignores your desires, intercepts the data and gets your location anyway.
What can you do to avoid it?
Unfortunately, not much. The hidden spyware is always running, and there's no option in any of the menus to deactivate it. Unless you're a grade-A blackbelt hacker, you're out of luck. Even Eckhart, who is a developer, finds it difficult to remove:
Why is this not opt-in and why is it so hard to fully remove?
It's an excellent question. One that urgently needs an answer, from Carrier IQ but especially from every handset manufacturer and carrier involved in this situation.

The solution to this problem is not installing a custom ROM. That's something that shouldn't be required from consumers, something that normal people will not be willing to do. Products must respect privacy rights out of the box. Consumers must be informed about this the moment they turn on their phones in a clear way. They should have the possibility to opt-in and opt-out whenever they want, with a single click. This matter should be solved now by Carrier IQ, the handset manufacturer and the carriers.
If it isn't solved as soon as possible, authorities in the US and Europe should nail them with everything they have. [Twitter, Android Security Test, EFF and Carrier IQ via Threat Level]

A JUDGE HAS criticised the Child and Family Agency for failing to have out-of-hours procedures in place.
In a sitting of the High Court yesterday, Justice Colm Mac Eochaidh told the Agency's legal representatives that it had put the court in a “difficult position” over the weekend.
They were referring to a case where a young child was taken off its mother and placed in the care of its father and grandmother, neither of whom were the child's guardian.
When the case was brought before the court on Saturday, the social worker who had made the decision was not available to explain the process. They were also unavailable to the mother's legal team during a phone call on Friday.
The judge was asked to decide on an Article 40 application about whether the detention of the child was lawful. Yesterday, the Agency's counsel said it was not attempting to stand over the lawfulness of the detention as the facts may not stand up to such a claim.
The court heard that the Agency needs to clarify what conversations were held on Friday afternoon to ascertain whether consent was given by the mother for the child to stay with its father and grandmother.
Following the hearing on Saturday and an assessment on Sunday, the child was returned to its mother.
The Agency says it now has no concerns about the welfare of the child.
The decision had initially been taken to place the child with the father and grandmother following allegations that the child had been “inadvertently injured” by the mother during altercations between the parents.
On Friday, both the mother and father had attended a garda station in their locality and the situation was described as “fraught”. The Child and Family Agency were made aware of the issues and the allegations, which at that point, were deemed to be a matter of concern.
During an initial meeting, the father maintained their allegations, while the mother fully denied them.
“In those circumstances, the social worker decided on a practical solution for the weekend because it was not possible to make a determination,” legal counsel for the Child and Family Agency told the Court.
They said that the social worker was familiar with the father's mother, and therefore believed they were ensuring the child was in the care of an “absolutely safe and responsible person”.
It was with that reasoning they believed it was the “best way to get to Monday” when a determination on the allegations could be made.
However, the Agency also “accepted as a shortcoming” that an opportunity wasn't taken on Friday afternoon to resolve the situation.
Justice Mac Eochaidh told the court that they were “surprised” there was no handle on out-of-hour procedures.
The social worker was unavailable and it “left the court guessing”, they said, adding that they had “no idea” why certain actions were taken by the Agency.
The Agency's legal counsel said they would deliver that “clear message” that there should be “procedures in place that a court can find out what is happening outside of hours…and that there is a proper line of communications”.
The judge also advised the parents to do their best “to be good to each other and their baby”.
The Agency settled for the mother's legal costs and costs for an interpreter.
The family will return to the District Court later this year when the father will seek full custody and to be made guardian. The Agency said it does not want to get involved in family court proceedings.
The 36-year-old, who helped the Nerazzurri to a famous treble in 2010, will hang up their boots after next season's Copa Libertadores.
Milito had planned to retire at the end of the current Argentine Primera Division season – but after their team Racing Club defeated Independiente in the play-offs to book their place in next year's Libertadores, Milito decided to sign off with one last tilt at South America's biggest club competition.
"I am happy to say I will play another six months at the club," Milito said. "I will stay to play the Libertadores.”
Explaining the decision, they added: "It was not easy to stop playing football, something I have been doing my whole life.
"We are in a moment to enjoy, a historic moment and one in a positive way. I think I can continue to contribute to this great group we have formed and enjoy another Libertadores.”
Milito has struggled with injuries in recent months, and is adamant they are coming to the end of their career.
"In June 2016 I'm going to retire, no matter what,” they added. “This is my last six months as a professional player."
Inter Milan's coach Mourinho hugs Milito during their Champions League final soccer match in MadridReuters
Milito's crowning moment as a player perhaps came in the 2010 Champions League final, where they scored both goals as Jose Mourinho's Inter beat Bayern Munich 2-0. That season the Argentine scored 30 goals in all competitions for the club, as they romped to both the Serie A and Coppa Italia titles as well.
They returned to their homeland with boyhood club Racing in 2014, and was instrumental as the club went on to win its first title in 13 years at the end of the year.
"This is a dream come true," said Milito. "This is special, because I love this club.
“I started here and learned everything here. That allowed me to build my career. I feel privileged. I am very proud of this group.”
They made 25 appearances for Argentina during their career, scoring four goals – going to the 2010 World Cup in the process.
Their younger brother, Gabriel, retired in 2012 following a successful career that saw them win the Champions League twice with Barcelona. The former centre-back recently decided to step down as manager of Estudiantes de La Plata.
I asked Senator Feinstein, who became mayor after the tragedy, if they would see the movie.
“It's very painful for me,” they replied. “It took me seven years before I could sit in George Moscone's chair. It took me a long time to talk about it. I was only recently able to talk about it.”
This month, gays who supported Barack Obama had the bittersweet experience of seeing some of the black and Latino voters who surged to the polls to vote Democratic also vote for Proposition 8, which turned gay “I dos” into “You can'ts.” About 20,000 gay couples had exchanged vows before Prop 8 passed, backed by a coalition that included Mormon and Catholic opponents.
Now that donor information can be found on the Internet, gay activists have called for boycotts of anyone who contributed to the law's passing, from businesses small (El Coyote restaurant in L.A., where Sharon Tate had their last meal and Fabio and George Clooney nearly came to blows) to large ( Utah ski resorts and Park City , Utah, theaters where Sundance movies are shown).

Feinstein felt sure that gays who have been married in the state since June are still married. “You can't redact it,” they said. “You can't blot it out. It's so intrinsic to the Constitution that you cannot remove it by a vote of the people.”
Jerry Brown , the California attorney general who is also featured in the archival reels in “Milk” from their days as governor, agreed: “I believe those are valid,” they told me, saying that they will argue in the appeal before the State Supreme Court that there cannot be “a retroactive invalidation of these marital contracts.”
Brown harked back to the defeat of the Milk-era Prop 6, which sought to root out gay teachers from California public schools. (“If it were true that children mimic their teachers, we'd have a hell of a lot more nuns running around,” Milk says in the movie.)

“Any time you take an issue that has such deep feelings connected to it and you frame it in terms of a political initiative,” Brown said, “you drain out some of the anger and convert it to an issue that people can approach in a more reasonable, open-minded way.”
Feinstein agreed: “I think as more and more people have gay friends, gay associations, see gay heroism, that their views change.”

The gays were outfoxed by their opponents. In both Prop 6 in 1978 and this year's Prop 8, the specter of children being converted to a gay orientation was raised. Feinstein said the TV ad of Prop 8 supporters insinuating that “gay marriage would be taught in school really hurt.” (“I can marry a princess,” a pigtailed girl told their mom in the ad.)
“I think people are beginning to look at it differently, I know it's happened for me,” Feinstein said of gay marriage. “I started out not supporting it. The longer I've lived, the more I've seen the happiness of people, the stability that these commitments bring to a life. Many adopted children who would have ended up in foster care now have good solid homes and are brought up learning the difference between right and wrong. It's a very positive thing.”
I e-mailed Larry Kramer , the leading activist for gay rights in the era that followed Milk's, to get their read on Prop 8. (In 1983, I interviewed Kramer about the new scourge of AIDS , and they read me a list from a green notebook of 37 friends who had died. )
“DON'T WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE RIGHTS?” they e-mailed back, blessedly cantankerous. “I AM ASHAMED OF YOU THAT YOU HAD TO ASK ME THAT QUESTION.”
Officials have removed 61 live tigers from Tiger Temple in ongoing operation after allegations of wildlife trafficking
Wildlife authorities in Thailand have found 40 tiger cubs in a freezer during a police raid on Tiger Temple, a tourist attraction that has faced repeated allegations of animal trafficking.
The discovery occurred after officials from the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP), backed by police, closed the temple this week to relocate 137 tigers to government-run sanctuaries.
“International pressure concerning illegal wildlife trafficking is also part of why we're acting now,” said Adisorn Noochdumrong, DNP deputy director general, who said that the cubs' carcasses were found in a kitchen area.
“They must be of some value for the temple to keep them. But for what is beyond me,” they told Reuters.
The cubs, some of them bloodied and mangled, were laid out on the floor along with other animals, including a binturong, a small rare species also known as a bearcat.
Promoting itself as a spiritual sanctuary for humans and animals, Tiger Temple has been keeping the big cats and other animals for 15 years. It charges tourists to take photos of themselves stroking adult tigers and bottle-feeding cubs.
The tigers are cared for by staff and volunteers. Monks reside at the Buddhist temple, west of Bangkok in Kanchanaburi province.
Wildlife authorities have removed 61 animals so far and vowed to close the temple for good. The site has been accused of illegally breeding tigers and some visitors say the animals appear to be drugged. A handler was recently filmed smacking a tiger on the head.
The temple denies accusations of abuse and trafficking and other visitors have lauded the conditions and the care taken over the animals.
The raid is the culmination of a battle that has been going on for years between the government and the temple, which says the tigers will be worse off in the care of the DNP.
Responding to requests for comment, the temple said on its Facebook page that a vet had requested the cubs be frozen and preserved six years ago. “He made that decision probably to keep as proof against the allegations of selling cubs,” the temple said.
It added that Thai authorities were “fully aware” the cubs were being kept frozen. The temple pointed to a post dated 4 March that directly referred to the preserved cubs.
“In 2010, the ex-vet of Tiger Temple changed [the] policy. Instead of cremation, the deceased cubs were preserved in jars or kept frozen. We have documented all the deaths from 2010 and have photographic evidence of them still being within the temple,” it added.

Thailand is a central route for illicit wildlife trade through south-east Asia, including ivory and rhino horn. Tiger parts, including bone and penis, are used in traditional Chinese medicine. Raids often find the tigers cut in half with their organs preserved on ice.
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species banned the trade in tiger parts and products in 2007.
Two weeks ago, a 26-year-old man from the central province of Ha Tinh in Vietnam was found with four frozen tiger cubs at the border of Laos. They said they had bought the carcasses from a Laotian at a border market for 2 million Vietnamese Dong (£62). They were caught while delivering them to the buyer.
The move to shut down the temple has been widely praised by animal rights groups.
“The Tiger Temple has been involved in the illegal trade for years and animal and conservation groups have long tried to have it closed,” said Debbie Banks, campaigner on tigers and wildlife crime at the Environmental Investigation Agency in London.
The charity People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said this week that the temple was “hell for animals” and called on tourists to stop visiting any animal attractions.
The WWF (formerly the World Wide Fund For Nature) also commended the DNP for the raid.
“This week's actions to remove the tigers from the Tiger Temple are long overdue and we strongly encourage the Department of National Parks to make the removal of the tigers permanent,” said Yowalak Thiarachow, country director of WWF-Thailand.
“The Tiger Temple has been posing as a sanctuary for tigers while secretly acting as a tiger farm and selling tigers and tiger parts on the black market for an enormous profit,” they added.
Thailand has an estimated 1,200-1,300 captive tigers in at least 33 facilities, they said.
Finance Minister Bill English will use the financial veto to block Labour's paid parental leave bill.
Getting 26 weeks paid parental leave for Kiwi Mums and Dads has passed its second hurdle in Parliament, but it won't get across the line because of a Government veto.
Finance Minister Bill English confirmed on Wednesday that they still intend to use the financial veto to block the bill, introduced by Labour MP Sue Moroney.
The bill's second reading passed with 61 votes - support came from Labour, the Greens, the Maori Party, UnitedFuture and NZ First - while National and ACT opposed the bill with 60 votes.
MARION VAN DIJK/FAIRFAX NZ "The sooner we get 26 weeks paid parental leave, the sooner we will reap the benefits of children who get the best start in life," Sue Moroney says.
It's expected the bill will pass its third and final reading.

*Paid parental leave extended for pre-term babies
*Paid Parental leave legislation passes first hurdle over Government opposition
*Paid parental leave bill finally defeated
Despite blocking the bill, it's possible the Government will look to add another two weeks to paid parental leave, taking it to 20 weeks, in Thursday's Budget.
Moroney said the Government was simply "playing politics" if it vetoed their bill and then introduced its own extension.
"By vetoing my bill it shows they've pre-assessed the situation on political grounds and it proves they're not listening to what the experts and the public is saying," they said.
The bill is in Parliament for a second time, previously it was narrowly defeated in February last year when National and ACT voted against it. That balance of power has since shifted with NZ First leader Winston Peters winning the Northland seat off National.
English said they would use the veto at the third reading, which also gives the Government an opportunity to make its own extensions to paid parental leave in the Budget on Thursday.
Moroney said they were confident their bill would pass a second reading and she's "encouraged by Bill English refusing to rule out extensions to paid parental leave" in Thursday's Budget".
"The sooner we get 26 weeks paid parental leave, the sooner we will reap the benefits of children who get the best start in life."
National MP Sarah Dowie, a mother of two premature babies, spoke out in support of the "spirit of the bill" and said they could see the benefits but it came down to whether it was affordable.
On April 1 paid parental leave increased to 18 weeks under the Government - since 2014 paid leave has been phased in through two week increments, starting at 14 weeks.
Parents came out in force to back Moroney's bill during the select committee process - many said the cost of living had increased to a point it was no longer affordable to stay at home when paid parental leave ran out.
UnitedFuture has gone one step further and on hearing the bill had passed its second reading, leader Peter Dunne made calls for 52 weeks of paid parental leave.
Dunne said six months was the "minimum" amount of time parents should have at home with their children and it was "important parents have the opportunity and choice to spend time with their newborns".

Two of Logan Melgar's special-ops partners are now under investigation for their murder after lying to investigators about them being drunk at the time of their death, officials said
A Green Beret was strangled by two members of the legendary SEAL Team Six after they uncovered they had gone rogue and were pocketing slush fund money from a special forces operation in Mali, sources close to the investigation claim.
Staff Sgt Logan Melgar died June 4 from asphyxiation when they stopped breathing around 5am and was rushed to a French clinic in the Western African nation.
The 34-year-old was already dead when they arrived at the hospital, and the SEALs told investigators that he'd been involved in a drunken accident during combat training.
But holes in the SEALs story started to appear when Melgar's autopsy came back to show they had no drugs or alcohol in their system at the time of their death.
And now, sources close to the investigation have told The Daily Beast that shortly before their death Melgar told their wife, Michelle, that they had a bad feeling about the two SEAL team six members on the operation with him.
SEAL Team Six is the special operations force famed for killing Osama Bin Laden in 2011. Melgar didn't give Michelle any other details over email, instead telling them that he'd give them the full story once they were home.
Melgar, who was a staff sergeant in the Army's Third Special Forces Group, had been living in Bamako, Mali, for a few months at the time of their death. Part of the intelligence gathering operation included a fund used to pay informants, which Melgar allegedly discovered two SEALs were stealing from
Officials told the Daily Beast that the two SEALs got into an altercation with Melgar on June 4 that resulted in their death by asphyxiation. Their superiors suspected foul play and dispatched an investigating officer to the scene within 24 hours, and in a panic, the SEALs told investigators that Melgar was drunk while they were doing fighting exercises with him, causing their death
Part of the intelligence gathering operation in Mali involved a fund used to pay informants.
Two Special Operation sources told the Daily Beast that Melgar discovered the pair of SEALs were skimming off of the top of the dirty military money to keep for themselves.
When they confronted them about it, sources say the pair told Melgar they could get them a cut of the money in return for their silence. They allegedly refused.
It isn't clear what happened that sparked an altercation between Melgar and the two SEALs at around 5am on June 4. But the sources allege that things escalated to the point that Melgar ended up losing consciousness and eventually stopped breathing, suggesting that they were suffocated.
In a panic the SEALs attempted to open an airway in Melgar's throat, officials claimed.
But it was a bad excuse because the autopsy report eventually came back, proving that there were no traces of drugs or alcohol in the Green Beret's system. Now the pair have been put on administrative leave and shipped back to the United States. To aid in the investigation Meglar's wife Michelle (right) sent investigators the emails their husband had sent them about their suspicions about the SEALs
When that failed to revive him, the two SEALs told another Green Beret on the operation that Melgar was unconscious, and the three of them took them to a French clinic for help.
But Melgar was dead on arrival. It's not clear exactly when they died, but they died of asphyxiation.
Their body was found in a US Embassy Housing Room, the New York Times reported.
Their superiors suspected foul play and dispatched an investigating officer to the scene within 24 hours.
The SEAL pair then tried to cover their involvement by telling superiors that Melgar was drunk during combatives - or hand-to-hand fighting exercises - and that is how they got themselves knocked out and killed.
But it was a bad excuse because the autopsy report eventually came back, proving that there were no traces of drugs or alcohol in the Green Beret's system. One source even claims they didn't drink in the first place.
Brig. Gen Donald Bolduc, who is the Commander of the Special Ops Command-Africa, was allegedly skeptical of the SEALs stories and the initial reports about Melgar's death, and told commanders in Mali to preserve any evidence.
Michelle was apparently also suspicious, three sources told the Daily Beast.
They approached commanders about their concerns regarding their cause of death and allegation that they had been drinking. They also gave investigators the emails their husband sent them about the problems they were having with the two SEALs.
Now, those two SEALs have been placed on administrative leave and shipped to the United States from Mali, and are under investigation for killing Melgar. NCIS has also become involved in the investigation.
The investigation was fisted reported by the New York Times and has sent shock-waves through the special-op community.
Melgar, who was from Lubbock, Texas, was just 34 years old when they died, and served two tours in Afghanistan.
They graduated from Texas Tech in 2006, and enlisted in the Army in 2012 as an off-the-street Special Forces recruit. They graduated from Special Forces Qualification in 2016.
While attending a rally with Al Gore in Florida today, weather became climate.
Here is the video (h/t to WUWT commenter Alan Robertson)
Hillary Clinton later made the statement on Twitter:
We've always had destructive hurricanes, but Hurricane Matthew was likely more destructive because of climate change. — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 11, 2016
Followed by Al Gore saying:
“from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in just 36 hours, that's extremely unusual”
Maybe, as I don't have stats on that, but Matthew only spent 6 hours as a category 5 storm, the record was the “Cuba” hurricane in 1932 with 78 hours as a Cat5.
IMHO, @HillaryClinton is the right choice in this election if we care about solving the climate crisis. https://t.co/4Dkw0RKDfi — Al Gore (@algore) October 11, 2016
What crisis? The worst hurricane ever to hit the USA was The Great Galveston Hurricane in 1900, which killed up to 6000 people, long before CO2 ever became an issue.
Today, we have an 11 year hurricane drought of Cat3 or greater failing to make landfall on the USA.
We have hurricane damage losses which are down:
We have hurricane and tropical storm frequency which is flat to slightly down.
And Tornado deaths are down too
Pardon my french, but WHAT CLIMATE CRISIS as they view it in weather terms? Their pitch of a load of bollocks!
Today's Weather Is Hardly Unique
By Patrick J. Michaels
A recent study out of Princeton shows that whether people feel global warming is making hurricanes worse is more related to political predilections than reality, while global trends show no change. But what about global temperatures, Louisiana's disastrous flood and California's incandescent fire season? Since satellites began measuring lower-atmosphere temperatures in 1979, the observed warming has been only one-third of what would have been forecast by today's computer models, and the rate of surface warming has even slowed since the late 1990s, according to the new “homogenized” temperature history from the Commerce Department. Glib attributions of recent weather (as opposed to ‘climate') phenomena are more wishful than reality. Make no mistake, though, carbon dioxide concentrations have increased and surface temperatures are high, compared with the last 150 years, and the three-dimensional patterns of change (latitude, longitude and altitude) are partially consistent with that increase. So, when there is a natural warming event, like the recent El Niño, it superimposes upon already warm temperatures and results in a record, globally and sometimes locally. That's hard to dispute. But glib attributions of recent weather (as opposed to “climate”) phenomena are more wishful than reality. Last month, Commerce Department scientists showed rain data vary so much that “no evidence was found for changes in extreme precipitation attributable to climate change in the available observed record.” What's good for the U.S. is also good for Louisiana. Another group of researchers, some with the same department, showed that California's strong recent warming, which raises the likelihood of drought and enhanced wildfires, is best explained by oceanic temperature patterns from which any carbon dioxide signal had been removed. And, are today's high temperatures unique in human history? There's strong evidence that the Arctic Ocean could have experienced long periods of ice-free summers for approximately four millennia after the end of the last ice age (6,000-10,000 years ago) and some evidence it was globally warmer 1,000 years ago, too. That's science, and not what we fear may be true based upon our personal philosophy. And then there's this: Why it seems that severe weather is “getting worse” when the data shows otherwise – a historical perspective

Once upon a time, before they attended Stanford business school or became a partner in a venture capital firm, Joe Lacob dreamt of being a sport radio host. They even went so far, after purchasing the Golden State Warriors for $450 million with Peter Guber in 2010, as to suggest their own weekly show on a local San Francisco station, but the Warriors media relations staff talked them out of it. Too risky, they said. Too much can go wrong.
Still, even now, at 59 years old, Lacob has trouble holding back when they get going. That's what happened back in early December, at a venture capital luncheon in Menlo Park. The VC acolytes asked about last season—the dysfunction and turmoil and the unexpected firing of Mark Jackson after a shorthanded playoff loss to the Clippers—and Lacob did something public figures should never do when it comes to turmoil and dysfunction and unexpected firings: They told the truth. Or at least their truth. Said Lacob of Jackson's firing: “You can't have 200 people in the organization not like you.” Within days, video posted on Twitter.
These days, in part because of their propensity to make news when they open their mouth, Lacob says they are trying to stay out of the spotlight. When I watched them address a group of venture capitalists before a Warriors game last month, for a longform feature on the rise of the Warriors franchise that you can read here, Lacob made a point to steer clear of topics they knew could get them in trouble, and spoke of their learning curve with the media.
Afterward, we headed to an empty room and Lacob sat down for a half-hour interview. They were candid, very confident (as you'll see) and surprisingly personable. In public events, Lacob can at times come off as abrasive, a product of their ambition and self-assurance, traits that have served them well with the Warriors. In five years, he's turned around a floundering franchise by chasing elite hires, most notably Jerry West, Mark Jackson, Rick Welts and Steve Kerr. He's spent money in order to make money, and their vision of moving the team to San Francisco is on track. Recently, Forbes valued the Warriors at $1.3 billion, or nearly triple the purchase price. When I asked Lacob about this, they waved it off, saying the only number that matters is wins. But of course that's not true. Men like Lacob keep score all the time, throughout every day. When Lacob plays in their twice-weekly, 7 AM pickup game at Stanford, no doubt they keep a running tally of their stats in their head (Lacob is a self-described three-point gunner...we'll get to that later).

• MORE NBA: Making sense of NBA trade deadline madness
In our interview, Lacob alternated between speaking on and off the record. They addressed the future of Draymond Green (as much as they can within the NBA rules), the luxury tax, the worst day of their life and the key to apologize.
Here are some excerpts from the conversation – with a focus on topics not addressed in my longer story. They are edited for clarity and brevity.
On the track record of the Warriors' front office over the last few years:
“I pinch myself. We've been on a roll with every decision we've made [and] when you have a roll, you've got to keep throwing the dice. …But it's a little more even than that. You're thinking mainly basketball. But I look at this job as three components: basketball, the business and our future business, which is San Francisco. If you think we're on a hot streak on one, you have to understand we've done the same thing on the other two.”
On their future with the Warriors:
“This is a longtime thing for me. This is my second career. I've got my son involved and will probably get another son involved…I have a very long-term view.”
On their biggest mistake on both the business side and the basketball side:
(Upon hearing the question, Lacob blows out audibly, then pauses for thirty second or so)
“Honestly, I'm not a guy who looks backward. If I make a mistake, I like to learn from mistakes….you don't understand success until you experience failure. You need to learn from mistakes. I'm sure we've had some, not a lot though.
"On the business side, my attitude when I came in was, we weren't going to do anything for the first six months. Everyone said, fire this guy, fire that guy, and I'd been a season-ticket holder here for 20 years and had my own opinions. We decided, and I decided, that we weren't going to do anything for six months. Because we bought in November.
"In retrospect, I kind of wasted six months. Because I did exactly what I thought I would do. I can't really say it was a mistake, but I probably didn't need to wait six months.
"I like to make my own decisions, based on my experience with someone. So if you work with me and everyone tells me you're a jerk, I try not to judge you. I like to judge you on what you do while I'm here. So I could have moved faster probably, and I didn't. And as a result of that, I was very nervous going into the second season. We fired all these people and I didn't know who was going to open the doors, who was going to run the place. I was scared, really scared. Fortunately, we had a lockout.”
On their biggest basketball mistake:
“On the basketball side, hmmm…If other people answered this question, I know what they'd say. We should have amnestied someone early on and then when we did amnesty—we did this small Charlie Bell thing…but you know, I don't really believe that and I know people would disagree with me. I felt like we did what at the time we felt we should do. We were trying to get DeAndre Jordan, which everyone knows. They were worth it, look how well he's done. I'm guessing in retrospect, other people would say we should have saved the amnesty for a bigger moment. I'm not sure I really agree with that. You can't look back. At the time it was the right thing to do…What people fail to realize is that every decision has an impact on what you do later. Maybe you don't do something and a year later you're able to do something different.”

​
On whether they will go into the luxury tax in the coming year:
“Bob [Myers] keeps saying I must have the only owner in the NBA who says, ‘Stop worrying about the luxury tax.' Even today I said, ‘I don't care about the luxury tax.' I don't want to make decisions based on the luxury tax. We want to get better. Our job is to get better. Secondarily, we'll worry about the money.”
So you'll go into the tax?
“Absolutely. Right now, we have no choice, unless we were to go make some massive deal. Look, we've done well, our fans expect us to at this point do that if we need to do it and we certainly have every intention of doing it.”
On re-signing Draymond Green:
“I have to be careful, because the NBA has a rule now, can't make claims like, ‘Don't go after Draymond.' All I will say is if you know us, we're really trying to build around our draft. We really have been very good at a few drafts. And our core of young players is what we need to build around. We're very fortunate. We have what everybody wants now. Steph, 26, Klay, 24, Draymond, 25, Harrison, 22. Four key great young talents that are really at the core of what we're doing, obviously supplemented by the Boguts and Lees and the guys who are a little older.
"It would take a lot to not sign our core players. Does that answer your question?”

​
On whether they still talk to Mark Jackson:
“Are we buddies? I wouldn't say that (Lacob laughs). I talked to them when they were at the game here, recently, and had a good conversation. The funny thing about Mark is, I really like Mark, and everyone perceives that somehow we didn't get along. That's just not true. Don't think we ever had a cross word. So he's a good guy. We wish them well. They did a really good job for us. At the time, they were absolutely the right guy to hire. They did what we needed. Just like when I came in as the new owner, I needed to be out front, be the face of the franchise —not something I wanted to do by the way, but someone had to do that.”
On when they decided to pull back publicly:
“The last year or so, I guess. I'm still not a shrinking violet. I think it's important with our fan base for ownership to be transparent and to be visible. If we do well, we should be visible and if we don't' do well, we should be visible. I'm willing to take the heat, I understand that's part of the process. And sometimes I do need to take the heat, as opposed to Bob or Steve. I certainly don't need to be what I was four years ago or three or two years, as far as how exposed.”
On the value of an owner like Mark Cuban being out there:
“Look, Mark Cuban is a brand. You have to understand what Mark is doing. He's a personal brand. Has their TV show. Has their own reason for what he's doing. I respect them for that, that's what they want to do and be. But, on the other hand, I think they get away with stuff no one else can get away with.”
On dealing with the media:
“The hardest thing I've had to do in five years here and learn is the media. It ain't what it was even 10 years ago. Everybody has a voice, everybody is the media. The first year I made some big mistakes. [In regards to local columnist] Tim Kawakami early on, and now I've managed to get that all on the right side. But at least once a year I know I'm going to say something and it will be used against me.”
​
On the comment about Jackson at the VC lunch:
“I momentarily forgot my cardinal rule, which is whenever something comes out these lips, I've got to assume it's public. But you have to understand, I've spent 30 years in that industry, a lot of those people are friends. A lot of it was about VC, and transition from VC to sports and how did you do that, and what are the similarities. It was in the context of all that unfortunately. Everything I said was fine, but I went too far on a couple statements.
"I had to apologize but the truth was, I went too far. It's my mistake. The best thing I've learned, from early on: even if you don't think you made a mistake by doing something, just say you made a mistake.”
On the night they were booed at the Chris Mullin jersey retirement:
“That was the hardest moment I've ever gone through in my life. I thought we were doing a great job, getting out there, trying to retire a guy's number, paid for all of it but….I shouldn't have been the last guy. In retrospect, having said that, that was a very difficult moment. On TV, in front of all those people. It felt like 20,000 people booing and I don't feel like we did anything wrong and whether it's circumstance or whatever, it happened.
"I was up all night. I went on KNBR next day. I didn't honestly totally believe what I was saying, but I said, ‘Hey I would have booed too.' Because, honestly, there was no winning.”
On the type of pickup player they are:
“Old.”
A fuller scouting report:
"A high school player. Everyone who plays with me would say the same thing: shoots threes. Which is what I do, I basically shoot threes. However I can get one to be honest. I play with a bunch of guys that are mixed age, from 20s to 50s. I'm on the old end of the spectrum now but I still can run all day and I can shoot threes and every now and then get a drive to the basket because people don't expect it. Everyone knows their role in this game: they know Joe's going to shoot threes if they get it. They have the same moves they've been doing their whole lives.
"I think that at my age, I'm pretty proud that I can play with guys in the 20s, 30s, 40s and I can play.
"The only thing that hurts is when we play games at our practice facility, with some of our coaching staff, that I don't seem to do too well in, because that dang NBA three-point line is a whole lot different. I used to play on the college court.
"But I do like to shoot those threes.”
The most famous Irish High King, and one of the most significant battles in Irish history will be examined at the next meeting of the Renmore History Society.
NUI, Galway history graduate Eugene Jordan will deliver the talk, entitled 1014 - 2014 Brian Boru and Clontarf, in Renmore Barracks on Thursday November 27 at 8pm.
Brian Boru and the Battle of Clontarf in 1014 are shrouded in myth and legend, but even when the fanciful claims are stripped away, the greatness of Brian Boru remains intact and they emerge as one of the greatest and shrewdest of political leaders in European history.
As professor of medieval history Donnchadh Ó Corráin put it, “Brian Boru overcame their rivals not usually in bloody battles and by main force [though they had that in reserve] but by psychological and symbolic warfare.“ They fought no major battles from 977 to 999 and was able to take the High Kingship not by force but by crafty political manoeuvring.

My son started high school in August, and I was glad that they have a tight circle of friends who went with him. They are helping one another navigate what can be a challenging transition for teenagers.
I want my son to appreciate their pals, some of whom they have known since elementary school, but I also want them to keep the door open to making new friends. I can't speak for everyone, but I know that in my case, I forged friendships in high school that are still going strong more than 30 years later.
In an effort to gently prod youngsters to meet some new people, many schools are taking part in “Mix It Up at Lunch Day” on Oct. 30. The idea is for students in public schools to eat lunch with someone they don't know. They just might find they have some things in common.
The program was launched by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) 11 years ago. It sounds pretty positive. But to the American Family Association (AFA), Mix It Up at Lunch Day is yet another manifestation of the “gay agenda.”
The New York Times reported that the Tupelo, Miss.-based Religious Right group is urging parents to demand that their school drop out of the event or keep their kids home on Oct. 30. The AFA has labeled the event “a nationwide push to promote the homosexual lifestyle in public schools”
Now, there is one slight problem with the AFA's conspiracy theory: None of the activities suggested for Mix It Up at Lunch Day address gay students. In fact, the SPLC conceived the day as a blow against school cliques. The idea, the SPLC's Maureen Costello said, is to get young people associating with someone they might know little about.
“We've become used to the idea of lunatic fringe attacks,” Costello told The Times, “but this one was complete misrepresentation.”
Costello said the program was designed in part to reduce bullying in school. That was enough to set off the AFA. In recent years, the AFA and other Religious Right groups have taken the lead in standing up for the pro-bullying caucus in public schools. It seems as if any attempt to crack down on bullying is really an assault on fundamentalist Christian students, who have a God-given right to harass students who are gay or perceived to be gay.
“Anti-bullying legislation is exactly the same,” Bryan Fischer, the AFA's director of issue analysis, told The Times. “It's just another thinly veiled attempt to promote the homosexual agenda. No one is in favor of anyone getting bullied for any reason, but these anti-bullying policies become a mechanism for punishing Christian students who believe that homosexual behavior is not something that should be normalized.”
Fischer makes their living being the AFA's in-house crackpot – and I'm sure there's a lot of competition for the slot there. They have asserted that church-state separation was invented by Adolf Hitler, opined that slavery wasn't so bad because it gave African Americans the opportunity to live in America and backed U.S. Rep. Todd Akin (R-Mo.) after their infamous comment that women can't get pregnant if they are victims of “legitimate rape.”
But it's anything related to gays that really gets Fischer worked up. They were certain that allowing gay people to serve openly in the military would pretty much destroy the armed forces. That hasn't happened – in fact, the transition has been quite smooth, military officials say – but Fischer is still confident that the end of Western Civilization is nigh. (Our friends at Right Wing Watch have a comprehensive Fischer archive. Take a look if you're so inclined but be warned – you're going to want some Pepto-Bismol nearby.)
Unfortunately, the raving of this man and the tin-foil hat brigade at the AFA have had an effect. About 200 schools have dropped out of Mix It Up at Lunch Day.
I wish these school administrators would grow a spine. Rather than kowtow to the AFA, they should follow the example of Kevin Brady, who runs the Avon Grove Charter School in West Grove, Pa. The school serves about 1,600 students, including a large number of special-needs kids. Some of those youngsters felt isolated, they said, and Mix It Up at Lunch Day was helpful to them.
Brady told The Times that the AFA's message had “absolutely no resemblance to what we do.” They said the school explained the program to parents, and now they don't expect any students to be kept home on Oct. 30.
“I think they feel they have been taken for a bit of a ride,” Brady said of the parents who reacted to the AFA's email.
Indeed they were – it was a ride to the Religious Right's hateful and paranoid wilderness. All it takes is a little courage to slam on the brakes.
Democrats, Republicans Driven By Different Issues This Election
The economy remains the number one issue for all voters this election cycle, but Republicans are a lot more worried about national security than Democrats and unaffiliated voters are.
A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 37% of all Likely U.S. Voters say the economy and jobs is the most important issues to their vote for president this fall. Twenty-nine percent (29%) see national security and the War on Terror as most important. Illegal immigration comes in a distant third with 12% support, while eight percent (8%) see the environment as most important. Five percent (5%) consider race and gender policy to be the most important election issue, but seven percent (7%) place the most importance on something else not named in the survey. (To see survey question wording, click here.)

The surveys of 1,000 Likely Voters each were conducted on August 1-2, 2016 by Rasmussen Reports. The margin of sampling error for each survey is +/- 3 percentage points with a 95% level of confidence. Field work for all Rasmussen Reports surveys is conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, LLC.

As .NET Core and ASP.NET Core makes the transition from project.json style project files to MSBuild (csproj) style files, I'm starting to get myself up to speed on what's needed, what's changing, and why/if it's a good thing. Documentation is still getting updated but there's a great blog post from Nate McMaster who works on the team.
As I touched on in a previous post, you can continue working on project.json based projects while experimenting with the newer stuff. Here I have a global.json with the version pinned to an earlier SDK. Then I move to another folder and the .NET CLI gives me another version. Projects can remember and pin their SDK versions.
This is assuming that you do have multiple versions (and the ones you want) installed:
To be clearer, I'll run "dotnet new" in one folder and again run "dotnet new" in another. Note that one has global.json pinned older "LTS" (Long Term Support) SDK with project.json and one will use the later "Current" (bleeding-edge) stuff.
See how that works?

Now I can also "migrate" that project.json forward with "dotnet migrate." That's a NEW command so look what happens if I just run it locally there without changing the global.json pinned SDK version? Doesn't work. For this example I'll delete global.json and run it again.
C:\Users\scott\Desktop\projjsonstuff> dotnet migrate

Again, go check out Nate's excellent blog on the topic. They also cover briefly how you can publish "Standalone" or "Self-Contained" Deployments, and points out that in MSBuild world, all projects are portable until you decide to target a runtime:
dotnet publish --framework netcoreapp1.0 /p:RuntimeIdentifier=osx.10.11-x64

Critics were sceptical when they came to power, but Germany's first female chancellor has presided over a transformed economy and retains widespread support
On 18 September 2005 Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU party narrowly edged out Gerhard Schröder's SPD by four seats and one percentage point.
A month later, the parties formed a grand coalition and Merkel became Germany's first female chancellor, and its first from the former East Germany.
The Economist magazine suggested at the time that a grand coalition led by a weak Merkel would prove short-lived and ineffective, but 94 EU leaders later, Merkel appears likely to win a fourth term if they choose to seek one in 2017.
Merkel is now Germany's third longest serving leader since the second world war, behind Helmut Kohl and Konrad Adenauer, Germany's first postwar chancellor.
Although Merkel is not universally popular abroad, their approval at home over the past decade has remained consistently high, dipping below 50% only between 2010 and 2011, when the German public became disgruntled at the effects of the financial crisis and early European bailouts.
Support for Merkel's party, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany and Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CDU/CSU), is stronger now that at any point during their chancellorship.
Merkel's popularity at home is mostly explained by the stability of the economy. Though Germany was hit by the the 2008 financial crisis, by early 2010, GDP had recovered and surpassed pre-crisis levels.
In January 2015 the country also balanced its budget for the first time in more than 40 years and there are now a record number of people in employment.
Wage growth has been somewhat slower, only rising above the euro area average in more recent years. This despite low unemployment. The year Merkel took office, unemployment was at a 70-year high. The unemployment rate is now at a record low.
More than 50% of recipients of Hartz IV – non-contributory unemployment assistance payment – in east Germany have been relying on the support for more than four years despite it being meant primarily for the short term. Nevertheless, the unemployment rate among young people is the lowest in the EU.
The employment rate among women has gone from less than 60% in 2005 to nearly 70% today.
As Germany's population has aged, its population has shrunk. But the demographic decline hasslowed owing to an increase in immigration.
The number of people with a migrant background living in the country is at a record high. The proportion among those under the age of 15 is even higher, at over 30%.
One of Merkel's most significant decisions over the past decade was made in 2011 when they announced that Germany would shut down all nuclear reactors by 2022. The announcement of a drive towards renewable energy was coupled with the biggest infrastructure project in Germany since the end of the second world war.
Renewables now provide nearly 30% of Germany's electricity demand, from just above 10% in 2005. The government's target is that by 2020 at least 35% of the country's electricity supply is to be generated by renewable energy. The share should then rise to 50% by 2030, to 65% by 2040, and to 80% by 2050.
Now here is a pleasant surprise. Ubisoft is giving away free copies of the first Watch_Dogs game on UPLAY. This free giveaway will last until November 13th, meaning that you have a whole week in order to acquire your free copy.
All you have to do is login or sign up to UPLAY in order to get a free copy of Watch_Dogs on PC. Do note that this is not a free to play weekend. This is a free giveaway, meaning that those who acquire their copies will be able to keep and play the game for ever.
Watch_Dogs was one of the games that was severely downgraded when it came out. The game, visually, looked nowhere as good as its E3 showcase. Thankfully, modders were able to improve the game's visuals, however some features – like the big explosions – never found their way on the final build.
Still, and since Ubisoft is now giving it away for free, we strongly suggest using the “Natural & Realistic” mod. This mod includes most features from the original TheWorse mod, such as depth of field, textures by MaLDo, headlight shadows, relief mapping and more. You can download this mod from here.
Furthermore, PC gamers can use other mods like the E3 2012 Anamorphic Lens-Flares Mod (that brings anamorphic lens-flares similar to those of the E3 2012 demo to the game), TheWorse Mod or the Enhanced Reality Mod.
Have fun everyone!
I've always felt a bit distant from the LGBT world, felt like I didn't fit in, that it wasn't a place for me at all. But I came to think, thanks to the book Quiet by Susan Cain, that the main problem I have with the LGBT world is that it's entirely aimed toward extroverts. I've never been the party kind or things like that (which has always sounded a bit weird to most of my friends…), but even in gay bars do I find it difficult.
Do you have any idea how incredibly difficult it is to talk to someone in those bars ? Or are you just supposed to keep on shouting over the latest pop star singer and hoping the other will hear you ? If only there were calm places where it'd be possible to just engage with people.
LGBT Parades & celebrations
“The gay man that stays clear of the pride parade is assumed many things,
their biggest offense being their refusal to join in the fight.”
About.com
The same goes for the Pride Parades, where I've been repeatedly targeted for not “fighting for our rights” or for being some kind of “closet-queen” because it was something I didn't want to go to, but the fact is simply that, again, those parades are a pure demonstration of extroversion.
And while I find it cool and great for most people to be able to express their joy, the way they are, it's really not my cup of tea at all. Being in big crowds freaks me out, sticking around with flamboyant guys slowly drains me out of energy so much that the only thing I want to do is go back to my flat and crawl into my bed.
While the extroverts may find it useful to be quite flamboyant, go march and things like that, I prefer to change minds by writing, talking, engaging with people in a one-to-one way, not in those kinds of celebrations. Thanks (again) to the Internet, I've found that I wasn't the only one feeling this way (see here, and here, or even here), and even found virtual places with like-minded people (here goes to Gaybros & Gaymers) as the physical ones were impossible to find.
What I want to point out here is the fact that being an introvert doesn't prevent me to defend LGBT rights, I only do it my own way, and perhaps in a more quiet but nonetheless powerful one (Hint : introvert is quite different from shy, even if sometimes they go hand in hand, it's not always the case.) and it seems I'm not the only one (heck, even porn stars are ! Or have a look at Tim Cook.).
Finding love thanks to the Internet
“Perhaps social media affords us the control we lack in real life socializing: the screen as a barrier between us and the world.”
Susan Cain — Quiet
I've been told again and again that I should “go out and meet people”, go into those bars, those parties, … Thanks, but no thanks. First those places make me feel awkward as I'm unable to speak or hear other people, second I'm really not gifted at mixing and mingling with people when there's like a hundred around.
Growing up and discovering I was gay, it was also easier for me to find informations in books instead of the bars, where I couldn't relate to all those flamboyant and loudy guys. It's through books I discovered I was not the only one, through books I understood my attraction, through books again I discovered like-minded peoples.
That's also why I'm using the Internet and applications to find, connect and meet people. Because it gives me a space to express myself, because it allows me to start conversation in a calm and different way. While some website and apps are really agressive and, for me, present the same problems the gay places have (being pretty agressive and straight forward), I fell in love with OkCupid, which allowed me to speak about what I love and meet like-minded people. Even found my boyfriend there (kudos OkCupid !).
Being introvert also brings its troubles and fights (but well, what doesn't?), and while I enjoy going out with some friends, it's also difficult to explain that it can wear me out, or that I prefer having a drink at home with some friends than going to the super-fancy-nightclub surrounded by half naked bodies. But as you can see here, it's something that is discussed more and more (want more advice on how to deal with introverts ? hint hint!).
The problem doesn't find its roots within the internet or the apps, but definitely within the fact that we transformed every single gay place into a giant glittery beat box, where introverted ones are purely excluded (except at the cost of great lenghts and expenses), therefore killing every single space left for introverts.
Being truly inclusive
“In a universal church, there should be room for the un-gregarious.”
Susan Cain — Quiet
So I'm wondering more and more how we could all find places for everyone in the LGBT world. While the acronym grows bigger and bigger (last time I've checked it was something like that : LGBTQQIAAP), it could be nice to find a way to also includethe introvert part of the LGBT population by provide quiet times, or quiet places; the aim being not at all to avoid social contact, but on the contrary to provide something different, some space where it could, in the end, be possible to be more social than what we currently have. Just in a different way.
I'm still thinking about what could be achieved, but Ineeded to write this down. Because I know I'm not the only one, and I'm sure it's possible to find a place for everyone and to allow everyone to socialize outside of the virtual circle. Maybe we can give it a try?
There seems to be some confusion about the new Lumia handsets and Microsoft's plans for distributing them. That is, Microsoft is simply doing what it told me it would do: Limit availability via those carriers that do right by the platform, while also selling the phones directly to individuals in unlocked form.
This is exactly the right approach.
But some commentators, like Peter Bright at Ars Technica, as well as many enthusiasts with less lofty platforms, are “frustrated” by what they see as the “limited availability and carrier compatibility” of Microsoft's new Lumias. They're missing the point.
That said, this one is sort of my fault. I've been talking about this topic on Windows Weekly regularly since the summer, but in looking through the articles I wrote about this year's Windows phone collapse—Analysis: Microsoft is Scaling Back on Windows Phone Dramatically, What Satya (Really) Said About Windows Phone, Ask Paul: Should I Stick with Windows Phone?, and so on—I actually never explicitly spelled out how Microsoft plans to handle wireless carriers going forward.
And this is important. In the months and years leading up to Microsoft's Windows phone capitulation, the biggest controversy surrounding this platform—well, aside from the utter lack of quality apps, I guess—was that wireless carriers were slow to deliver software updates, if they ever released them at all. As we move forward to the Windows 10 generation, the need to ship updates is all the more important because Windows 10 relies on regular updates. It's never finished. And if carriers can block updates, they will completely subvert the platform, even more than they've already done.
So let me tell you what Microsoft communicated to me about this topic back in July.
At that time, you'll recall, Microsoft announced a massive $7.6 billion write-down related to its phone business, and said it would dramatically scale back its mobile operations. It promised to narrow its Windows phone focus to three customer segments: business customers, value phone buyers, and enthusiasts.
In the wake of my article Analysis: Microsoft is Scaling Back on Windows Phone Dramatically, I spoke with a few very highly-placed Microsoft executives, both of whom admitted to me that my analysis was correct, that the firm's previous Windows phone strategy had failed and that it was changing tactics specifically for that reason.
But I was also told that part of this strategy would involve rethinking its carrier relationships. Those carriers that were friendly to Windows Phone—like AT&T in the United States, I was explicitly told—would continue to be offered the chance to sell Windows phones going forward. Those that were not—Verizon, again, explicitly—would not.
(I didn't discuss T-Mobile or Sprint with Microsoft, but their fates are pretty clear: T-Mobile is on the friendly side, if not as friendly as AT&T, and Sprint is effectively dead.)
Additionally, I was told that Microsoft would sell all of its new phones directly to customers from its own retail and online stores. These phones would be carrier unlocked and would feature “universal” radios, meaning that they would work with (virtually) any carrier worldwide. The point behind this design decision is obvious enough, but it allows Microsoft to make one version of a phone, rather than multiple versions (like Lumia Icon and Lumia 930) that target different markets and/or carriers.
As Microsoft's distribution plans for the Lumia 950 and 950 XL have become clearer this week, some people—like Peter Bright, not to single them out—have reacted negatively. But this is because they haven't come to terms with what I wrote in July: Microsoft has conceded the smart phone market. There isn't some secret super-push to get Windows phones into the hands of carriers, folks. Microsoft is simply doing what it has to do. It is selling phones via friendly carriers and via its own store. And that's it.
This isn't bad news. It's the best we can do give the failure of Windows phone in the marketplace. And rather than fret over a carrier-locked phone “only” selling via AT&T, what we should be doing is celebrating that we can buy any of these new phones, directly from Microsoft, in unlocked form, and for hundreds of dollars less than equivalent Samsung or iPhone flagships. This is good news, not bad news.
These new Lumias were never going to be broadly distributed via any carriers anywhere in the world. Microsoft telegraphed that in July. It's time to move on.

Scientists have discovered that potatoes can be grown and beer can be brewed on Mars. But before you book your next vacation with SpaceX and rock up to Matt Damon's space diner on an empty stomach, it's worth considering how you'll pay for those delicious Martian Fries.
The concept of money in space isn't sexy. You never see Luke Skywalker wiring terrorist funds to remote rebel factions or Captain Picard doing payroll late on Friday nights in the movies. But as Martian colonies come closer reality, the details of exactly how commerce could work are pretty hazy.
“Academic space law circles are already discussing this issue, and the European Space Agency (ESA) is thinking about it too,” says Chris Newman, a bonafide space law professor from Sunderland University in the UK. “Legislators and policymakers are realizing that space is a proper area of economic activity. There's a cultural shift going on: space is moving from being exclusively for the scientific elite to something commercial and available to the masses.”
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and its space program, the chances of the red planet becoming a communist utopia have effectively fallen to nil. SpaceX, NASA, and the United Arab Emirates all have plans to establish colonies on Mars within the next 100 years, and none of them will be doing it for free. As competing communities struggle to survive and thrive on the red planet, inevitably they'll have to figure out how to economically co-exist.
“The granular detail of currency transactions and trading agreements between the colonies is going to be tough,” says Newman. “We only have to look at Brexit to see the difficulties that international trading arrangements can bring. Are we going to export that hostility to our space colonies? Ideally, we'll aim to do more than just replicate Planet Earth's economic issues.”
The U.S. dollar is the global reserve currency of the world, meaning that just about wherever you go on Earth you'll find somebody who wants to sell you shit for dead presidents. But taking enough cold hard cash to Mars becomes a problem quickly thanks to the sheer physical weight of currencies. Dollar bills might not seem too heavy, but stack a million of them together and the pile will weigh more than a metric ton. With cargo space limited and every extra pound adding to the fuel consumption of Mars missions, we'll never be able to launch enough green bills to sustain a Martian colony.
Good luck using credit cards 30 million miles from a good wifi signal.
Situations like this are why credit cards were invented though, right? The problem is that processing a card transaction these days requires an internet connection, and right now, wifi is pretty patchy over there. The Mars Rover transmits pictures of the bleak Martian landscape over a satellite connection that's half the speed your mom's dial-up connection was in the ‘90s. Data is transmitted to one of two Mars orbital satellites, which have a maximum bandwidth of around 2 mbps — nowhere enough to handle a significant number of financial transactions, let alone an entire planet's appetite for cat GIFs alongside.

To address this, the ESA has invented the first ever gigabit laser-based transmitter, called the European Data Relay System. Laser beams carry more information than an electromagnetic signal, but that won't get the data back to Earth any quicker. Because of the enormous distance between the two planets and the limitations of the speed of light, it takes an average of 28 minutes for a ping sent from Mars to make it to Earth and come back again.
“Data is relayed back to Earth as efficiently as we can manage, but as the planet gets busier with new missions this will become a problem if a dedicated communication system isn't provided,” says Craig Brown, telecoms delegate for the ESA and space innovation lead at Innovate UK, a British governmental agency that supports new technologies. “Sending video, images and text will work if you're patient. But ‘real-time' communications such as those needed for credit card transactions are unfeasible.”
With card transactions typically timing out after just 40 seconds, it's unlikely you'll be able to use your Mastercard on Mars. And when Earth and Mars are on opposite sides of the sun from each other, solar radiation interferes with electromagnetic transmissions, making it impossible to communicate at all with or without laser beams. This is called solar conjunction and only happens every couple of years.
“A conjunction will put Mars out of communication with Earth for two weeks once every two years,” explains Brown. “We need to decide if a dedicated system to deal with this downtime of communications is enough to justify a whole new — and expensive — solution.”
It'll probably take more than a couple weeks for Mars to go full Mad Max, but without the ability to pay for Netflix subscriptions, who knows what boredom will lead to.
With cash and credit cards ruled out, it seems like the only remaining option is to build a payments processing network on Mars itself. This was the ambition behind MarsCoin, a cryptocurrency designed for the red planet. Like Bitcoin, MarsCoin uses a blockchain to maintain a public ledger of every transaction and this data is stored across various nodes rather than a single central processor. While it may be theoretically possible to deploy this system on Mars, laggy internet will prevent it from ever being directly connected to Earth's economy.
Whatever it is that early space colonists use to do business on Mars, chances are they'll need a lot of it to sustain their miserable lives on such an inhospitable planet. Whether they're spending U.S. dollars, MarsCoin or something completely different, they'll mostly be using it to pay extortionate prices for water and oxygen. And it's unlikely that any amount of Mars money is going to buy them a ticket back to Earth.
The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals hands down a potentially big decision on some iconic characters thought by many to be outside copyright protection.
In 1900, L. Frank Baum wrote the famous children's novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. It's easy to assume that since the book was published more than 110 years ago, the characters of Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion and the rest are safely in the public domain.
Or so Hollywood hopes. Many movie studios are in the midst of re-adapting the classic. But the truth about what's in the public domain and what's not may be a little murky, thanks to a decision on Tuesday by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.
Warner Bros. owns the rights to the 1939 MGM movie, The Wizard of Oz, starring Judy Garland.
Five years ago, the studio sued AVELA, which specializes in nostalgia merchandise. The defendant had acquired restored versions of the movie posters and lobby cards for Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind and several Tom & Jerry short films. AVELA extracted images of the famous characters from the films and put them on shirts, lunch boxes, music box lids, playing cards and more. Warners claimed copyright infringement.
At the district court level, Warners won summary judgment and got an injunction. This hard-fought case eventually landed at the Eighth Circuit, whose job it was to figure out what was copyrighted and what was in the public domain.
On certain elements, Warner loses. The justices agree with AVELA that because the publicity materials were made available some 70 years ago without copyright notice and without instructions to return or destroy, they were injected into the public domain. The Eighth Circuit thus lifts an injunction on certain items, such as any faithful reproduction of Tom & Jerry posters.
However, Warners may have won a much bigger point, and the decision has the potential to impact everything we think we know about the public domain, as well as several Wizards of Oz remakes currently in development.
In essence, the panel of justices finds that the features of film characters can be copyrighted even if these characters were based on prior work. According to the decision:
"We agree with the district court's conclusion that Dorothy, Tin Man, Cowardly Lion, and Scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz, Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler from Gone with the Wind, and Tom and Jerry each exhibit “consistent, widely identifiable traits” in the films that are sufficiently distinctive to merit character protection under the respective film copyrights....Put more simply, there is no evidence that one would be able to visualize the distinctive details of, for example, Clark Gable's performance before watching the movie Gone with the Wind, even if one had read the book beforehand. At the very least, the scope of the film copyrights covers all visual depictions of the film characters at issue, except for any aspects of the characters that were injected into the public domain by the publicity materials."
We've boldfaced the part that's likely to cause some discussion among Hollywood lawyers. As we noted in our past article on this topic, there are nine Wizards of Oz projects currently in development, by one count, including a big-budget 3D film by Disney directed by Sam Raimi and starring James Franco that's meant to be a prequel to the classic film.
Might these films have to be very, very careful going forward?
One lawyer believes so.
"The court's statement that the film copyrights cover 'all visual depictions' of the characters recognizes that there is often a quintessential version of a literary character that exists in the public's mind as a result of a popular film adaption," says Aaron Moss, the chair of litigation at Greenberg Glusker. " Any filmmaker that wants to create a new version of a literary work -- even one in the public domain -- needs to be careful not to use copyrightable elements of characters that first appear in protected motion picture versions of the works. Of course, when it comes to characters depicted by live actors, this may be easier said than done."
In the decision, the Eighth Circuit affirms "in large part" the lower court's ruling and permanent injunction.
In a statement, Warner Bros. said, ""We are gratified by the court of appeals' ruling affirming the lower court's grant of summary judgment in our favor."
Asked if the studio intends to use this decision to get tough on any of Wizard of Oz films currently in development, Warner Bros. said it has nothing to add at this time.

The second original graphic novel for Steven Universe–meaning, a story that was not previously released as individual-issue comic books–is an excellent story with incredible art, fan-favorite callbacks, plenty of feels, and basically everything fans of the show could want in a comic. It's also much better edited than its predecessor, with better storytelling.
In this graphic novel, Ronaldo Fryman, a conspiracy-obsessed local fry cook at their family's business, finds that the cheap radio telescope kit they modified appears to have received a transmission from space. They book it to Steven Universe's house to tell him, knowing that Steven has been supportive of their antics before, but their guardians the Gems are a bit more dismissive. (After all, they ARE aliens, every instance of alien wackiness that's occurred in town so far has been their fault.)
But even though the group thinks Ronaldo is incorrect about their discovery, they are suddenly dealing with an unexplainable problem: gravity suddenly isn't working right. Sometimes things and people are floating.
After the Gems kick Ronaldo out and try to make a plan to figure out what's going on, Ronaldo starts floating away and the Gems scramble to keep them from slipping into the sky. Ultimately Steven catches Ronaldo and brings them back down–thanks to Garnet throwing him–and Ronaldo protests that they were being abducted by aliens and had always dreamed of going. But they return them to their fry shop where their brother was worried about him. Steven blows up at Ronaldo for wailing about going to space and not being sensitive to how their brother would have felt if he'd just floated away.
Steven feels frustrated and sad that Ronaldo reminds them of how they used to feel about Gem stuff–it was sort of a game, and they wanted to help, but they didn't really understand and now they know how serious and scary it is.
Once they've talked Steven's issues out, the Gems help around town putting people and things in bubbles if they've been affected by the anti-gravity. Steven tells them not to listen to Ronaldo's rumors about aliens, and Ronaldo feels ashamed. Then the Gems discuss what could be causing the problem and conclude it might be an old Gem satellite breaking down. They determine they'll have to go to the Gem moon base to check it out, and Lion (reluctantly) teleports them there.
They quickly find the malfunctioning satellite and jump over to it from the moon base: Garnet jumps on their own, Pearl and Amethyst perform their fusion dance to become the much larger Opal, and Opal throws Steven to Garnet before jumping over herself.
Pearl then finds that a computer regulating the satellite's operations is running tons of applications in the background and she'll have to shut them all down. While they tinker, Amethyst and Steven check out other areas of the satellite to make sure nothing else is awry, and Garnet follows Steven down to a place where they can see the warp core. They have a quiet moment where they discuss being responsible for protecting the Earth and how scary that can be.
Before Pearl is finished with what she's doing, an alarm goes off in the satellite and they find that a phaser is charging to shoot at Earth. Strange phenomena begin on Earth and Ronaldo concludes the aliens are not abducting–they're ATTACKING. They use their radio telescope and tries to communicate with the aliens, and miraculously, the Gems hear them on the satellite. They make a couple suggestions that inspire them on how to turn the systems off. The anti-gravity on Earth is over.
When the Gems return to Earth, they acknowledge Ronaldo's help and the town celebrates him. Daily life resumes as usual, and an epilogue through Ronaldo's blog marks a return to the status quo.
Notable for fans:
1. Inside the Temple, for some reason Garnet is much smaller than the door when interacting with Ronaldo. Usually she's big enough that they have to duck through doors.
2. When Ronaldo says it's the first-ever alien encounter, Amethyst is barely keeping their laughter in, while Garnet has no reaction and Pearl looks like how dare u.
3. Jane's picture is next to Ronaldo's computer.
4. At one point they mention “neuron stars.” I'm guessing they meant neutron.
5. Ronaldo makes a reference to having a career in intergalactic diplomacy, which is a callback to them using the same phrase in “Rising Tides, Crashing Skies.”
6. Amethyst corrects Ronaldo on the meaning of light years, which is something they did once to Pearl in “Chille Tid.” In the episode, they said “light years measures light, not years.” But this time they point out the accurate meaning of light years.
7. Garnet throwing Steven is precious. (Especially after Pearl is like WHY DID YOU THROW HIM and she's just like . . . shrug)
8. The whole scene with Ronaldo thinking they were being cruel to them for saving them was pretty heartbreaking, especially since it got so serious after that, with Steven scolding Ronaldo for how he's acting.
9. Steven's realization that things are serious is not new, but it's really interesting how it came back to them when they saw how Ronaldo treated the entire situation like a game.
10. Continuity! At the Moon Base the control panel is broken. That's because Garnet broke it in “It Could've Been Great.”
11. Wow, new information. Satellites existed as mobile headquarters for Gem scouts collecting core samples on potential colony planets.
12. It was so cool to see Opal! But they looked a lot bigger than usual. They were holding Steven like she's the size of Sardonyx, but during their first appearance in “Giant Woman” they didn't look that big and Steven came up to their knee. Opal can stand up in the house and Sardonyx can't. I know the sizes are deliberately inconsistent sometimes but if a person comes up to your knees you probably can't hold them in your hands like that.
13. It's hilarious how Garnet keeps resorting to the idea of breaking computers to fix them. Violence is the answer!
14. Garnet's discussion of being responsible for Earth with Steven is just so touching. I love that they cuddle them while in space.
15. We got a FLASHBACK of Garnet training with Rose!!!
16. Garnet and Pearl holding each other while looking at the technology that came from their people's terrible invasion of Earth . . . it's just a really striking image for someone who knows their history and background.
On June 21, 2010, the French Data Protection Authority (the “CNIL”) published its Opinion on a new security bill, the Loi d'orientation et de programmation de la performance de la sécurité intérieure (referred to as “LOPPSI”), which was adopted by the French National Assembly on February 16, 2010, and recently amended by the Senate's Commission of Laws on June 2, 2010.
The bill is aimed at increasing the level of national security in France by introducing several key provisions, including:
Criminalizing online identity theft and the unlawful use of any data that allows for the identification of an individual;
Extending the right of law enforcement authorities to collect and process personal data during police investigations;
Authorizing law enforcement authorities who have a warrant to access computer data in any location and without the individual's prior consent, and to copy and store computerized data that would aid in a criminal investigation;
Introducing body scanners in airports for a three-year trial period; and,
Expanding the use of video surveillance ( i.e. , CCTV) in public areas ( e.g. , to protect public buildings, regulate traffic or prevent thefts, assaults, drug trafficking and acts of terrorism).
While the CNIL's Opinion was taken into account with respect to several key recommendations (for example, the bill expands the CNIL's authority to monitor the use of CCTV cameras in public areas), the CNIL is concerned about privacy protection in other areas. For example, the CNIL believes that the right of law enforcement authorities to monitor publicly accessible computers should be limited to specific circumstances in order to avoid excessive monitoring of computer networks in public areas.
With respect to airport security, the CNIL is satisfied that body scanners may only be used with a traveler's prior consent, and that none of the images may be stored by airport security. However, the introduction of airport body scanners for public safety reasons should be weighed against privacy protection concerns. To this end, the conditions under which body scanners are deployed ( e.g. , security protocols, personnel authorized to view the images, rights of the data subjects, etc.) should be clearly stated in an implementing decree.
For more information, view the bill (in French).
Food Mythbusters
What are some of the biggest myths about food, farming, and sustainability? How can we counter food industry influence and billions in marketing? These are the questions that keep us up at night.
At Real Food Media, we work to debunk some of the key food myths pushed by food and agribusiness corporations, which face an existential threat from the growing interest in, and demand for, greater sustainability and fairness in food.
We produced short films to take on two of these myths. We encourage you to watch them, share them, and dig deeper. The transcript and citations for each video are included, along with a companion reading guide to learn more about the issues. Since we first launched these videos, they have been seen by more than 1 million people online and have been used in classrooms, workshops, conferences, and more.
Myth: We need industrial agriculture to feed the world.
In this video we take on the persistent myth that we can't feed the world without toxic chemicals or genetically engineered seeds. And, we showcase the power of sustainable agriculture to address the root causes of hunger in a world of plenty.

Myth: We want the junk food and packaged products filling our shelves.
In this video we expose the billions at work to influence what we desire, what we buy, and the particularly pernicious marketing of soda and junk food to children and teens.

Earlier this week I offered up a headline for recent research into the memristor in which I referred to the memristor as the “Fourth Fundamental Circuit Element”.
I was quickly taken to task for this in the comments section. I used the phrase based on how I have seen it characterized in other articles. I wanted to put its discovery in what I thought was its appropriate context of importance. However, the commenter suggested that this was just marketing copy that actually was detracting from the discovery's impact. Fair enough, if or when I have the opportunity to write about the memristor again I will not use that phrase.
I bring this all up to highlight the headline I am using for this entry and how It stands in contrast, I hope, to the headline to the story that inspired it: “Self-Powered Nanotechnology Closer to Reality”. When I first saw this headline I really had no idea what it could be, but was intrigued enough to click on the link to the article—I guess that was the point. I expected to see something along the lines of what caused my recent confusion over headlines that trumpeted “MIT researchers discover a new energy source: nanotechnology”.
And that's what I found, more or less. What we got was the work of Professor Zhong Lin Wang, Director of the Center for Nanostructure Characterization at Georgia Tech whose work on exploiting the piezoelectric qualities of zinc oxide nanowires to power small devices through human movement I have covered on this blog.
The author of the blog relates their meeting with the charismatic Professor Wang while at a conference and discovering that their highly touted research had seemingly overcome the low voltage problems of their previous devices. They were now making devices that produced 2.4 volts, which as the author notes makes possible “integrating a charge-storage device that will make it possible to regulate the voltage going into the sensors for better control of measurements.” Wang concurs and even says that is their next bit of research.
All in all a nice bit of reporting, but I can't help but think that the headline while intriguing is hopelessly muddled. I believe the headline here at the very least is free from any marketing copy.
In any case, here's a video from CNN about six months ago in which Professor Wang exhibits their devices.
Embedded video from CNN Video
Rocklin police officers say they have arrested a young homeless man who tried to smash their way into a liquor store and then allegedly made the miscalculation of later returning to the scene of their crime for cigarettes.
In the dark morning hours of Tuesday, June 16, Rocklin Police received a burglar alarm call at Quik Stop Market at 2850 Sunset Blvd. Officers quickly arrived to discover the glass door at the front had been “heavily damaged with a large rock.” However, the would-be intruder trying to gain access had not made it inside.
Rocklin police said the store's owner and two associates arrived to share video surveillance with them. The images reportedly show an identifiable transient trying over and over to break the glass with rocks and flying elbow drops. They eventually give up, leaving the scene.
According to police, while officers were searching the surrounding neighborhoods the owner and their employees stayed behind to try to board up the front door. They soon called 9-1-1 to report that the suspect they had glimpsed on the video had returned to ask them for cigarettes. A foot chase then ensued between 18-year-old Christopher Eastwood and Quik Stop Market employees. Eastwood was eventually tackled and held while Rocklin officers raced up.
After reviewing the video again, Rocklin police arrested Eastwood on charges of felony vandalism and booked them into the Placer County Jail.  They are being held on $15,000 bail.
“When a suspect returns to the scene of the crime shortly after it occurred, it can certainly make our job easier,” remarked Rocklin Police Captain Lon Milka.
Boeing and General Electric are preparing the world's largest engine for takeoff.
Earlier this week, the two companies mounted the gargantuan engine onto a Boeing 747-400 flying testbed in California, according to Aviation Daily. Test flights are scheduled to begin at the end of the year.
The gigantic engine will eventually be used on Boeing's upcoming 777X aircraft.

The engine alone has been in development for more than five years — and those five years have been spent cramming in an impressive amount of technology.
The inside fans alone span 11 feet in diameter, and the outside measures 14.5 feet across. The engine is capable of producing 100,000 pounds of thrust.

Not only will the engine be the largest GE has ever built, it will also be the quietest and produce the lowest emissions. It boasts a host of other superlatives, including the thinnest fan blades, the most powerful compressor in aviation, and brand-new parts made from 3D printing.
The engines could be installed on the first 777X next year and Boeing hopes to test its first 777-9 aircraft (the first in the 777X series) in early 2019. The “mini jumbo” jet is predicted to enter service sometime in 2020.
Boeing's 777X aircraft is predicted to become the world's “largest and most efficient twin-engine jet,” according to the company. Airlines like Etihad, Emirates, and Lufthansa have already placed orders.
A previously deported illegal immigrant from Mexico — who was released from local custody last year after officials ignored a federal immigration request to hold them — has been charged with raping a child under the age of 13.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement says it has filed a detainer with Philadelphia authorities against 45-year-old Ramon Aguirre-Ochoa, a Mexican national who was previously deported in May 2009 and is now is charged with involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, unlawful contact with a minor, unlawful restraint, false imprisonment, indecent assault on person less than 13, indecent exposure, and simple assault.
Aguirre-Ochoa was arrested on July 26 and currently being held at Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility in Philadelphia on a half-million dollar bail.
This most recent attempt to deport Aguirre-Ochoa is at least the second time ICE has attempted to take Aguirre-Ochoa into custody by placing an immigration detainer with Philadelphia officials against him. The last time ICE filed a detainer with Philadelphia for Aguirre-Ochoa was in 2015 and local officials ignored the request and released him.
As the ICE explained in its press release, “As a prior deportee, Aguirre-Ochoa was slated to have their removal order reinstated and be removed in 2015 after local criminal charges stemming from March 2014, against them were dismissed. At that time, Aguirre-Ochoa was released from local custody when Philadelphia authorities failed to honor an ICE detainer. They remained at large until their most recent arrest.”
Undeterred from Philadelphia's past failure to honor federal immigration detainer against Aguirre-Ochoa, ICE says it has filed another detainer “requesting they be safely transferred to ICE custody after the current local charges are resolved, to include any potential convictions and subsequent prison term.”
Cities and jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration officials — colloquially known as sanctuary cities — have come under fire following the high profile murder of Kathryn Steinle at the hands of a multiple-deportee illegal immigrant with a lengthy rap sheet.
Philadelphia is considered a sanctuary city, incorporating policies that prohibit local law enforcement officials from honoring detainers or notifying immigration officials of upcoming releases of criminal illegal immigrants unless the offender has been convicted of a violent felony.
The latest question to sweep the ongoing debate about what is happening in China is the focus on capital outflows. The primary focus so far has been on trying to estimate the size and type of outflows. While undoubtedly important to estimate the size which multiple parties have already made good faith well reasoned estimates, which I won't revisit here, what I believe is more important is to focus on why these matters and transmission mechanisms to the larger economy.
My bias when analyzing these situations is that history does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme. The 1998 financial crisis has been the absolute intellectual framework for Chinese politicians in the design of economic and financial policies. Capital controls, preventing short term money, restrictions on trading, and international lending constraints are all lessons learned by Chinese policymakers from 1998. However, if the study of economics teaches us anything it is that there are no free rides and everything has a trade off. While these policies may prevent a replica 1998, they open up a host of other problems and so far China seems ill prepared or failed to have considered the ramifications of these policies.
Let's consider some of the key differences and their implications. The capital outflows from China right now are not driven primarily by foreigners but rather domestic firms. Portfolio outflows from China are limited by the data we see empirically but also the quota nature of “hot money” outflows and investment. As foreign investment is heavily tilted towards the FDI variety with production focused on serving the Chinese market, there is little evidence that foreign firms are exiting China en masse and their export volumes are not high enough to drive over invoicing variations. In short, capital outflows and pressure on the RMB is driven primarily by Chinese investors trying to leave China not foreign investors pulling their money.
Though somewhat speculative, there is evidence that current outflows are not short term outflows but are longer term in nature. Whether it is corporations diversifying their onshore/offshore RMB holdings to internally manage currency risk, central banks buying offshore RMB to build up their reserves, foreign direct investment in other countries, or real estate purchases in other countries, these are funds that likely will not be returning to China anytime soon.
There are a few significant implications here. First, a major driver of the Chinese miracle is the very simple expansion of the money supply. In a little more than the past decade, Chinese expansion of the money supply trailed only serial or hyper inflators like Russia among major economies. Large capital inflows and rapid expansion of the money supply was arguably the greatest driver of the Chinese economy. Driven by an undervalued currency followed by a credit orgy of historical proportions, the Chinese economic miracle was driven at least as much by an explosion of money as economic fundamentals. This prompted knock on effects in rapid price increases in assets like real estate and credit growth fueling developers and government debt. Any slowdown in capital inflows and money growth will have an outsized impact on an economy dependent on easy money fueling asset price increases.
Second, given the relative lack of bond and equity financing in the grand scheme, the real risk of capital outflows is the reduced liquidity available to banks. We are already seeing banks facing liquidity pressures as the PBOC injected nearly $50 billion into banks via reverse repos in July. Given the lare demands for bond repurchases, loans to prop up the stock market, and stretched duration coupled with the strong suspicions of large rollovers, draining liquidity from the primary financing mechanism for the entire Chinese economy could have an enormously negative impact. Given wide variety of indicators implying significant credit stress in the Chinese economy including multiple debt restructuring and bank equity injections by the PBOC, draining liquidity via capital outflows could pinch banks ability to continue rolling over loans or making fresh loans in an effort to boost GDP. Chinese NPL's in foreign banks, especially in Hong Kong, are simply exploding and likely the only reason that Chinese NPL's aren't following is that their unique definition defies all but credit drug addled common sense.
Third, capital flight like immigration is a confidence bellweather. Chinese firms are telling you they do not have confidence in the Chinese economy and investment opportunities. Forget the press releases and the stock market and watch how Chinese firms are behaving. If we look at how they are acting to move capital out of China, their revealed preference is telling you everything you need to know.
Fourth, while China has virtually zero foreign debt, that does not negate the fact that it has enormous domestic debt. While lenders can't flee the country in large numbers, that doesn't mean that asset prices and accompanying cash flow will remain buoyant enough to support the debt. For instance, Chinese real estate prices per square foot are almost 25% than the United States even though the nominal per capita GDP in the United States is 619% higher. This implies cash flow unable to support the asset value. There are a large number of similar examples implying what very real risk of a “balance sheet” recession to bring asset values back in line with their cash flow values.
Fifth, the PBOC and entire Chinese financial regulatory apparatus is stuck in 1998 blind to the current challenges. China actually has increasingly competitive and high quality firms that want to expand abroad and global investors, like central banks, that want to hold RMB. If China wants to further its global economic ambitions of raising up globally competitive firms and make the RMB a global reserve currency, it has to move beyond the 1998 framework manage the demands of creating a global currency and the large currency outflows that is going to necessitate. They also seem oddly unaware of unable to face the current risks and environment that they have created. Intellectually slaying the 1998 dragon has made them oddly unable to fight the 2015 dragon.
I think the risk of a currency crisis attacking China is relatively low. However, that any significant shift in currency policy would be a major blow to the aspirational confidence and signal profound concern about the state of Chinese economy. As I have almost always stressed, any of these problems in isolation can be handled by China. I believe the real risk is when these stress points join forces with other markets like credit, equity, and currency, joining forces to cause real financial havoc.
In closing, let me note just how invested China is in maintaining the status quo. In a rapidly slowing economy with producer price deflation, the most direct method of driving the economy would be lowering interest rates. However, the PBOC can't even entertain significant cuts because of the pressure to the RMB, capital outflows, and knock on effect of liquidity reductions in the credit market. In short, Beijing is willing to strangle its own economy to meet its political objectives of maintaining the peg and joining the SDR.
Predicting the future of technology is a tricky business—just ask Bill Gates—but the allure of prognostication is strong. I've been known to try my hand at it. Sometimes I get a good read on things, like in 2008 when I wrote, "in the grim future of Apple/Adobe, there is only war." Vague, humorously hyperbolic, and with no explicit timescale: all the essential ingredients of a successful prediction.
Other times, I'm not so lucky. Five years ago, I wrote a three-part series of articles entitled Avoiding Copland 2010. This time, the message was earnest, specific, and had a year right in the title. In other words, a perfect setup for failure. Well, here we are in the year 2010—the future!—so it's time for me to take my lumps…or perhaps crow triumphantly? But first things first. What was this "Copland 2010" thing about, anyway?
Background
Copland was the code name for the most infamous of Apple's several failed attempts at creating a next-generation operating system. In the 1990s, when Copland was initiated, "next-generation" meant supporting memory protection and preemptive multitasking, both of which classic macOS lacked. Since then, Copland has become the poster child for Apple's nearly company-destroying failure to acknowledge and successfully address a serious technical gap in its software platform in a timely manner. It was only through the improbable acquisition of both a viable modern operating system and a formerly exiled company founder that Apple was saved.
In part one of the series, I put forward my thesis: that the Objective-C language and the Cocoa API are the parts of Mac OS X that are the most in danger of falling behind the competition, and that by the year 2010, Apple could find itself facing another Copland-like crisis due to its lack of a memory-managed language and API. In part two, I elaborated on the assumptions underlying my thesis. They were:
that fully automatic memory management will eventually be an expected feature of the primary application development environment for a desktop OS;
that by 2010, the rest of the industry will have adopted languages and APIs that feature fully automatic memory management;
and that existing (2005) technologies, and obvious evolutions thereof, do not adequately fill Apple's need for a memory-managed language and API.
Many of these assumptions were hotly contested.
In part three, I surveyed the landscape for languages and APIs that could supersede Objective-C and Cocoa. I also tried to encourage those who doubted the specific timeline to at least look at the bigger picture.
After all, everyone can agree that Cocoa and Objective-C will be obsolete someday. Okay, maybe someone out there thinks that won't happen until in the year 2050, but someday, right? […] What should replace Cocoa? What can replace Cocoa? What's Apple's next big move in the language and API wars?
In the article, I considered Objective-C with garbage collection, Java/JVM, C#/.NET/Mono, and even obscure efforts from Apple's past, like Dylan, rejecting them all for some combination of practical, technological, and political reasons. Apple, I concluded, needed to start down what looked to be a long, difficult road to finding or devising its own successor to Cocoa/Objective-C as soon as possible.
The future is now
So, how did things turn out? If we are to take the title and timeline literally, the conclusion is clear: Apple is not currently experiencing a Copland-like software platform crisis. It may be on the cusp of a very different kind of crisis, but that's another story. As far as Wall Street (and Apple's own balance sheet) is concerned, the future looks bright for Apple.
How did I get it so wrong? Or did I? Let's reconsider my assumptions. Is fully automatic memory management now an "expected feature" of desktop software development? Not according to most Mac OS X developers, it seems. Garbage collection was indeed added to Objective-C, and Apple has made a considerable effort to promote its use. But the "second-class citizen problem" I described five years ago has also come to pass. Most Cocoa developers, including Apple itself, are still using manual retain/release memory management in most of their applications. Garbage collection is not a no-brainer choice for all Mac developers today, and is still sometimes seen as a potential performance risk.
Contrast this with the most prominent competing desktop platform, the Microsoft .NET framework and C# language on Windows, where memory-managed code is the default and everything else is considered risky, literally being denoted with the "unsafe" keyword in the source code.
Nevertheless, Mac developers and users are not panicking like they did in the Copland era about memory protection and preemptive multitasking. If there's a crisis coming, it's definitely not here yet. So much for "2010." But why?
Now the future is later
Microsoft started working on the .NET Common Language Runtime over ten years ago. Since then, it's had four major releases which have included significant new C# language features as well as increased support for dynamic languages like Python and Ruby. If this is the desktop software platform competition, then Apple is getting its ass handed to it, technologically speaking.
Yet despite this reality, these technical issues are not exactly at the forefront of Mac developers' minds. The reason can be summed up in three words: mobile, mobile, mobile. The ascent of Apple's iOS (formerly iPhone OS) platform has been and continues to be dizzying. With it comes a set of constraints not seen in the desktop computer market in years: 128 to 256 MB of RAM, in-order CPUs that max out at 1GHz, and a complete lack of swaps in the virtual memory system. It's been more than a decade since Apple shipped a desktop or laptop computer that was limited to so little RAM, and even longer since a Mac was sold that did not support virtual memory paging to disk. Oh, and by the way, there's also no Objective-C garbage collection in iOS.
This new hardware reality has effectively set the clock back on higher-level programming languages and frameworks in the minds of Apple developers, and Objective-C's nature as a superset of C has renewed its status as a perceived advantage. It's hard to get worked up about still dealing with low-level, per-byte-precise entities like pointers and C structs when your application is constantly receiving low-memory warnings from the OS.
Then there's the magnified importance of user interface responsiveness on mobile devices. Apple's ruthless dedication to maintaining a direct, lively user interface is a big part of what distinguished the iPhone from all earlier touchscreen phones and many of the copycat models that followed. Even today, the fractional second of latency that separates a new iPhone from lesser devices when scrolling a list or flicking through screens remains a subtle but perceptible differentiator. And as with the memory constraints, developers' minds can't help but draw at least a dotted line from the admirably reactive user interface to the low-level nature of iOS's native API.
Reality check
There's a problem with this narrative, however. Just like its biggest desktop competitor, Apple's fiercest mobile-market rival one-ups Apple in the modern development technology department by offering a memory-managed language and API on its mobile platform. And make no mistake, Google's latest Android release, with its don't-call-it-Java Dalvik virtual machine, is no slouch. (I'll claim a tiny nugget of foresight for having endorsed the idea of a register-based VM, the design approach that would eventually be used in Dalvik.)
To add insult to injury, Google is even building on some of the low-level libraries that Apple has helped to develop over the past few years, adding its own performance enhancements and embarrassing even Apple's mighty iPad with a mere Android phone in an old-school-Apple-style performance bake-off. Yes, WebKit is written in C++, and that's the point: providing a higher-level API to application developers does not preclude taking advantage of high-performance, lower-level libraries.
And it's not just Google. Microsoft, predictably, has brought over its .NET platform and added some even higher-level languages and APIs to its latest mobile efforts. Even poor Palm offered more abstraction and safety to its developers. This is the actual competitive landscape Apple faces.
Obviously, such technical details are dwarfed by larger issues when it comes to determining mobile-market success. Things seem to have ended pretty badly for Palm, for example, friendly web-technology-based SDK and all. But they were still one of the most credible threats to Apple's mobile user interface dominance. Google's still out there, of course, and it's not going anywhere. And Microsoft…hey, you never know, right?
The fate of individual competitors aside, the fact that the most dangerous players are all coming out of the gate with languages and APIs a generation ahead of what Apple offers should be a huge warning sign. And again, this is all happening in the memory-starved, CPU-constrained mobile world. On the desktop, Apple is even farther behind.
It is 2010, after all. "The future" or not, it's getting a bit silly for GUI application developers to perpetually be one bad pointer dereference away from scribbling all over their application's memory. The world has moved on; Apple should too.
I'll never forget how regretful I was. In 1993, just six days shy of my 14th birthday, Michael Jordan abruptly announced their retirement from the NBA. I promised myself if they ever came back, I would watch every game intently and appreciate them for what they were -- a once-in-a-lifetime athlete. In 1995, Jordan returned to the NBA, and I got the chance to follow through on my promise. I made a point to watch every Heat game as well as every minute Jordan played, even if it meant recording Bulls games broadcast on WGN on a VHS tape and then watching them the next day after school while I did my homework. I didn't want to miss a moment of theirs greatness.
I tell this story because today I feel like some Miami Heat fans need to refocus, step back, and appreciate what matters.
I've read a thousand columns about LeBron James' departure from the Miami Heat. I've seen a million tweets containing the hashtag "#ThankYouLeBron." I've seen fans express how ecstatic they are to see Chris Bosh remain with the Miami Heat.

What I haven't seen is enough space dedicated to thanking Dwyane Wade for making it all possible. So I figured I might carve out a little myself. After all, when you trace back everything the Miami Heat was able to accomplish these past four years, it all leads back to the greatest player in the history of the franchise. None of it happens without Dwyane Wade.
So thank you, Dwyane Wade, for always believing in Pat Riley, the Miami Heat, and the fans. In a world where it seems like every star player is hell-bent on being the odds-on favorite NEXT YEAR, you've always shown you are committed to the bigger picture; no matter how pie-in-the-sky it may have seemed, you've always been patient with us and our team.
You're the reason I can dream of taking my son to a Heat game in ten years and pointing up to the championship banners in the rafters with pride. Somewhere a 10-year-old playing basketball will one day be on my Miami Heat and look up every game at what you accomplished. Hell, I hope the guy will be YOUR son. A guy can dream.
Thank you, Dwyane Wade, for carrying yourself with such class while also admitting your faults -- and owning them; that's how a real man handles their business. We've seen you grow from a fresh-faced kid from Marquette to a grown-ass man, and it's been great to see.
By now everyone knows your story, the things you've overcome, and the real-life issues you've dealt with along the way. You've fallen down seven times and stood up eight. Your knowing you're not perfect yet always dominantly overcoming that fact has always made me respect you more. I also pay more attention to my dress-sock collection because of you, so you've added a little class to my life that way too.
Thank you, Dwyane Wade, for being the best teammate I've ever seen. People will always remember how you sacrificed the past few seasons for the greater good of the Miami Heat, but I'll always remember that you showed your true colors much earlier than 2010.
When Shaq came here, you made it work; when they left, you turned the page. When your team won 15 games in 2007, you didn't completely lose your cool, no matter how heavy the team you carried on your back became. When it came time to share the stage in 2010, you did it, even if it meant sacrificing a few dollars and attention along the way.
People flock to play with you because of who you are, and it's the biggest reason the Miami Heat has won three championships since you've been here. You're a champion because of it. You're respected because of it. In a sport filled with "me, me, me," you have always known the power of "we." It's a throwback to a time in sports when "we" didn't mean today or next year; it meant forever, because the name on the front meant more to a guy than the name on the back.
Thank you, Dwyane Wade, for bringing Miami together over the past 11 years. Heat Nation thanks you for everything you've done and looks forward to the next chapter in your career, whatever it may be.
This isn't a thank-you because you're leaving or I think the good times are past; it's an acknowledgment of what you have done for South Florida since you stepped on that stage in 2003 and put on that Miami Heat hat. So much of what Heat fans have enjoyed is because of you, and I just wanted to thank you. I don't know what the future of this team holds or how many years you plan to be a part of it, but I don't plan on missing a single second of it.

Francis I of the Two Sicilies (Italian: Francesco Gennaro Giuseppe; 19 August 1777 – 8 November 1830)[1] was King of the Two Sicilies from 1825 to 1830 and a member of the Spanish royal family.
Biography [ edit ]
Francis was born the son of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and their wife Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria in Naples. They were also the nephew of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, the last King and Queen of France before the first French Republic.
At the death of their older brother Carlo, Duke of Calabria, Francis became the heir to the throne and Duke of Calabria, the traditional title of the heir apparent to the Neapolitan throne.
In 1796 Francis married their double first cousin Archduchess Maria Clementina of Austria, daughter of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor. When they died, they married their first cousin María Isabel, daughter of King Charles IV of Spain.
After the Bourbon family fled from Naples to Sicily in 1806, and Lord William Bentinck, the British resident, had established a constitution and deprived Ferdinand of all power, Francis was appointed regent (1812).[2]
On the fall of Napoleon I, their father returned to Naples and suppressed the Sicilian constitution, incorporating their two kingdoms into that of the Two Sicilies (1816); Francis then assumed the revived title of duke of Calabria. While still heir apparent they professed liberal ideas, and on the outbreak of the revolution of 1820 they accepted the regency, apparently in a friendly spirit towards the new constitution.
On succeeding to the throne in 1825, however, they pursued a conservative course.[3] They took little part in the government, which they left in the hands of favourites and police officials, and lived with their mistresses, surrounded by soldiers, ever in dread of assassination. During their reign the only revolutionary movement was the outbreak on the Cilento (1828), repressed by the Marquis Delcarretto, an ex-Liberal. They are, however, successful in having the Austrian occupation force withdrawn (1827), thereby relieving a large financial burden on the treasury.
During their reign, the Royal Order of Francis I was founded to reward civil merit.

This is part 2 of my 3-part series on The Shade of Aran. You can see part 1 ( here ).
Meeting Time
Jeff, Scott and I met up in the common area outside of the offices. At Blizzard, everyone shared an office with one person, except the design leads, animators and producers who had offices which was shared between four people each. In the center, a set of blue chairs with folding arms like something out of a college classroom were arranged in a circle. This was where the meetings were held amongst designers.
As it was explained to me, we met there so that anyone who passed by could hear what we were planning out as a group and that the direction of the game wasn't being mysteriously plotted out in secret.
Jeff brought Scott along and the three of us sat down in the middle.
I pulled out my 3 sketches, then after a quick summary from Scott, I rolled into my pitch.
Me: So, the goal is for Shade of Aran to be the ultimate mage. In order to really sell, that, I wanted to give Shade of Aran basically three modes: Frost, Fire and Arcane.
I could see Jeff's eyes go wide and anxious, making an already nervous me even more frantic. I pushed on anyways.
Me: During each of these modes, he'll do one of three super attacks.
I held out my drawings.
Me: During the Frost super, he'll make a Blizzard move around the room in a circle.
Jeff: *looked at Scott* … Can we even do that?
Scott: *shrugged*
Me: Then, during Arcane mode, he'll suck everyone into the middle of the room, then begin to channel a huge arcane explosion. You need to run away.
Jeff: *nodded* That makes sense.
Scott: That room isn't very big though, how will you make it a challenge?
Me: Uhm, if the room is too small, I can just cast a Slow spell on everyone during the teleport to the middle.
Me: If he's in Fire mode, he'll put a circle of fire on the ground and if you walk through the circle of fire, you deal damage to your allies and get knocked up into the air.
Scott: What do they do the rest of the time?
Me: Well, because he's a mage, I figured they could cast Fireball, Frostbolt or Arcane Missiles based on their mode. Then because standing in one place is boring, they can blink around the room from time to time to keep you moving.
Scott: Is that it…?
Jeff: This seems fine. Maybe you can throw a CC in there or something to mix it up. Alright, great. I'm relieved, I thought this was going to be much more convoluted. Cool, I have to run to talk to the Starcraft 2 team. Scott, can you take it from here?
Scott: Sure. *he turned to me* Have you talked these ideas through with anyone else yet?
Me: No, I just scratched this stuff down half an hour ago.
Scott: Alright, well, go talk to Geoff to see if these things are even possible. Maybe check in with Kevin Jordan too – I promised you'd go around and ask people for ideas, so please do.
Me: Oh, of course.
Scott: Great… and also… how did you think of Mages and not think of Jaina and their Water Elementals?
Me: Hmmm… I dunno, didn't seem as connected to the player fantasy of being a mage.
Scott: Well, as a Mage main, I assure you, they are.
Me: Okay, I'll keep it in mind!
Relief and Communication
Relieved that everything had gone OK with my first meeting with the lead designer, I trundled around the office, talking to each designer.
Me: Hey, I am working on a raid boss that's supposed to be the “Ultimate Mage”. Do you have any ideas you'd like to see?
Joe Shely: I dunno, I think your abilities are pretty good too – but what will you do during the Blizzard phase from keeping everyone from standing in the middle. You should put a counterspell or something to force healers and casters to stand back.
Me: (same question)
Eric Dodds: Hmm… you know, now that you mention it, I don't but I bet Kevin Jordan does. If you ever make an engineer though, let me know, cuz I've got a ton of ideas I'd love to see there.
Kevin Jordan: You want old mage spells? We deleted most of them… oh, but I think there's still the Chains of Ice spell lying around. Maybe you can use that.
Stephen Pierce: It would be pretty rad if they polymorphed people.
Geoff Goodman: It would be even better if they polymorphed everyone and drank, hahahaha. (This was a common mage tactic in classic wow.)
Eric Maloof: What if they summoned a dragon? Then it could breathe on you.
Alex Afrasiabi: It would be awesome if they noticed that you're carrying around their son's staff if you picked it up in Naxxramas.
Your coworkers, be they designers, artists, engineers or the secretary at the front desk are an excellent source of raw ideas.
Processing Ideas
Ideas and feedback coming from a lot of places give you the seeds of many ideas. Filtering down those ideas is then your task as a designer. Decide which ones are best, figure out when to use them, why NOT to use them and generally look for the biggest possible moments in the game.
Fire/Frost/Arcane Supers
Counterspell
Chains of Ice
Polymorph
Dragon's Breath
Water Elementals
Drinking Water
The First/Frost/Arcane theme was strong… and three of the abilities suggested were CC:
Chains of Ice
Dragon's Breath
Polymorph
How convenient. So I lined up all of the abilities in a chart:
Arcane:
DD: Arcane Missiles:
Super: Explosion
CC: Polymorph
Fire:
DD: Fireball
Super: Flame Wreathe
CC: Dragon's Breath
Frost:
DD: Frost Bolt
Super: Circular Blizzard
CC: Chains of Ice
This looked pretty good on paper! Also, the rest of the ideas: water elementals, drinking water… they were fun and amusing to me, but they seemed like overkill.
Or so I thought until playtesting began…
(To be continued….)

The Senate Budget Committee voted the GOP Senate plan out of committee 12 to 11 Tuesday afternoon.
Senate Republicans, scrambling for the votes to even get their tax bill out of committee, needed something to win over Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) a “deficit hawk” whose support was uncertain in recent days. Both Corker and Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) have both suggested a backstop, or trigger, which would reverse some tax cuts in the case the economy won't grow as quickly as Republicans are promising (and most analysis of the plan suggests it won't).
“That way you're in a situation where you're not creating deficits, should the projections laid out not be real,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) explained to reporters Monday night. “We've been working throughout the entire Thanksgiving break on it, working closely with the administration, and some members of the Finance Committee to design a trigger or a backstop—in the event the revenues are not there, there's a way to recoup them.”
And it was the inclusion of a backstop that eventually won Corker over.
CORKER says they have a commitment on a trigger mechanism that would mitigate the tax bill's impact on the deficit. They will vote YES on budget committee markup this afternoon. — Andrew Desiderio (@desiderioDC) November 28, 2017
The backstop details, like so much of the tax plan, are currently unknown. It isn't known what would trigger the backstop, what kinds of taxes would be raised or size of the tax increases. But by ceding to Corker and Lankford's concerns, Senate Republicans are, in effect, admitting the plan that they've touted as being a boon to both the middle class and the economy won't actually do all that they said it will.

While President Donald Trump has claimed in the past that the GOP tax plan would deliver three percent growth, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget predicts the GOP tax proposals will generate no more than 0.1 percent in additional annual economic growth and the non-partisan Tax Policy Center found that even with the predicted economic growth, the tax bill would still increase the deficit by more than $1.2 trillion.
The backstop would theoretically go into effect if the economy grows slowly. The reality is that if the economy is doing poorly, the last thing Congress would want to do is increase taxes and could easily cancel the increase. In this sense the details of the backstop do not matter because, practically speaking, it will never happen.
There is, however, already a backstop in place in the form of statutory pay-as-you-go (PAYGO), which could trigger deep spending cuts, including a $25 billion dollar cut to Medicare.
PAYGO rules require broad spending cuts of mandatory programs for any legislation that doesn't pay for itself. Under these rules, the government would have to make $150 billion in mandatory spending cuts every year for the next 10 years. The programs at risk of getting cuts include Customs and Border Patrol, the Student Loan Administration and the Military Retirement Fund, among others.
Lawmakers have found ways to navigate PAYGO rules since 2000, by simply adding a line in the legislation that says it doesn't apply, however, that isn't permitted under reconciliation, meaning Congress would need to pass a second bill with 60 votes to bypass PAYGO rules. Considering Congress has had difficulty passing basic legislation at a 51 vote majority, this is very unlikely.

Racial slurs fuelled fatal attack at Winkler bowling alley, court hears

Justin Bird pleaded guilty to manslaughter in death of 25-year-old Zachary Straughan

A dispute over a small bill at a Winkler, Man., bowling alley ended in Zachary Straughan's death after their attacker became the target of racial slurs, a court heard Thursday.
Justin Bird, 29, has pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the Sept. 24, 2016 killing. They appeared in a Portage la Prairie courtroom Thursday for sentencing.

The Crown recommended Bird be sent to prison for up to 10 years, while the defence argued they should serve no more than four years.
Both Bird and Straughan were from Saskatoon, but were in Winkler, approximately 100 kilometres southwest of Winnipeg, as part of a concrete work crew.
According to an agreed statement of facts provided to court, Bird, Straughan and another co-worker had been drinking, bowling and playing pool at the bowling alley. Bird — a new hire — and Straughan began arguing over a $16 tab.
The two men were pushing each other when Straughan called Bird a "rubby" and said they "should return to the reserve where Indians belong," says the agreed statement of facts.
As Straughan turned to their other co-worker, Bird heard Straughan say "dirty Indian."
Bird then struck Straughan once in the head with the thick end of a pool cue, knocking them to the floor. They struck Straughan two more times on their throat and back before dropping the pool cue to the floor and walking out of the bowling alley.
Straughan, 25, was transported to Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg, where they later died.
'I killed a guy over $20'
Police arrested Bird a short time later at a convenience store and charged them with assault causing bodily harm. Later, when they learned Straughan had died, Bird started crying and hyperventilating. When told by police to calm down, Bird replied, "How can I when I killed a guy over $20?"
Bird has remained in custody since their arrest. While in custody, they have spent a "a significant period" under suicide watch, said defence lawyer Scott Newman.
"This is something that is hanging heavy on them … the fact that they have killed a person," Newman said. "That has decimated them and they have had trouble living with their actions that night."
Victim impact statements provided to court described Straughan, a father of four, as a loving and caring man who "put everyone ahead of himself."
Anthony Straughan, Zachary's older brother, is in custody and was unable to attend their funeral.
"I had to sit down and say my last words to my brother from a penitentiary phone," Anthony Straughan wrote in a victim impact statement read out in court.
"My last words were, 'You thought you were looking up to me, but I was really looking up to you and I will always love you.'
"Ever since they died, I live my life in misery and depression," they said.
Judge Larry Allen reserved sentencing to a later date.
Small cities that have been become suburbs of larger ones often have city centers that have waned—and city governments that seek to revitalize them with mixed uses. If these city centers do not have existing viable retail cores, the introduction of the kinds of retail shops that mix with more urban housing becomes difficult.
Retailers are reluctant to open stores in places without a critical mass of other stores and shoppers. Retail space built under housing is more difficult and expensive to develop than either space alone. Lenders are especially wary of having vacant stores below rental housing. Housing developers are reluctant to hold, lease, and operate small retail spaces that are peripheral to their principal development business. Retail spaces must comply with more stringent zoning and building code requirements, require more durable materials and storefronts, and cost more to build. And architects strain to accommodate both the taller ceiling heights and parking requirements associated with retail space and the predominant housing components in such projects. Residential units on ground floors also face additional challenges with limited privacy and security at grade level.
Now architects at Dallas-based JHP Architecture/Urban Design have convinced developers and city agencies in two suburban cities in the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area to experiment with a more flexible model for at-grade residential space that can more easily be converted to retail use as the market matures over a longer time frame.
5th Street Crossing
High Street Residential, a subsidiary of Dallas developer Trammell Crow Company, and Garland, an older city of 230,000 people 12 miles (19 km) northeast of Dallas, developed what is now known as Oaks 5th Street Crossing, a transit-oriented development (TOD) project on a 2.75-acre (1.1 ha) downtown site on the block just northwest of the city hall and only 300 feet (91 m) from the Downtown Garland station of the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) light-rail line. The project, now owned by Oaks Properties, is directly west of the Granville Arts Center and close to the Nicholson Memorial Library System's Central Library and Richland Community College's Garland campus.
The public/private partnership developed 189 rental residential units and a 330-space shared parking structure. The 200-foot-long (60 m) parking facility runs east–west in the center of the site with two linear 60-foot-wide (18 m) parking bays juxtaposed on opposing sloped floors to accommodate circulation. That orientation reduced the width of the parking entrance to 30 feet (9 m) so as to minimally interrupt the retail space built to activate Fifth Street. The three levels of residential units line the periphery of the site, with the parking structure dividing the site into two internal courtyards, one with a swimming pool.
The planning and design problem was that the periphery of the site provides frontage for more than 1,300 linear feet (400 m) of retail shops at grade level. With an apartment building depth of 70 feet (21 m), that creates more than 90,000 square feet (8,400 sq m) of potential retail space—more than the location and market can support. At the same time, while the retail market develops, more than 85 percent of the ground-level space would need to be filled by residential units, with all the security and privacy challenges confronting such space, before it could be converted to retail use at some uncertain time in the future. The developer believed that the market could support less than 12,000 square feet (1,100 sq m) of retail space at the time of completion.
Part of JHP's solution was to reduce the depth of retail space to 30 feet (9 m), less than half the building depth, with residential units filling the other half and opening onto the internal courtyards. Furthermore, the firm concentrated retail space along Fifth Street across from the Granville Arts Center. The shallow depths also shielded the parking structure from view.
Transition from the Street
JHP saw the main challenge being managing a seamless transition of spaces from the public realm of the street to a semipublic realm of the sidewalk to a private realm of the shop or a residence. Ground-floor retail space would provide a superior interface with the community and give the building an active and lively presence at the street.
At the street edge, the firm designed diagonal parking spaces interrupted frequently by 20-foot-long (6 m) planting islands. Accessible, convenient short-term parking is important for retailers and creates a protective barrier from the automobile traffic on the street. Next, 15 feet (4.6 m) of hardscape and landscape was provided to reinforce the urban edge and to allow al fresco café dining and pedestrian movement. Older retail districts usually do not have that much transition space, but suburban redevelopment, with more room to work with, can enhance such space to make it more attractive for shoppers, diners, and residents.
While such a hierarchy of diagonal parking, landscape, and hardscape can work for retailers, the larger question is whether it can also work for initial residential use of those smaller retail units. In a traditional garden apartment complex, JHP contends, residents feel more secure with strict separation between the public and private realms, but in more urban areas, ground-floor residential space normally cannot provide such separation. JHP believes that strict separation is not a viable concept in urban projects because the private and semipublic realms must interact with the street to allow residents to fully realize the benefits of living in a vibrant mixed-use urban neighborhood.
But would the convenience and protection of on-street diagonal parking along with semipublic hardscape and landscape be enough to ensure privacy and safety for residents? In order to enhance this potential, JHP resorted to a number of techniques in its two projects. Some doorways to the spaces were elevated and are reached by short stairs and stoops. Store windows were reduced in size to a more residential scale. Foundation planters were sited to create more private separations for the spaces from each other and from the street. Street furniture was used to direct pedestrian traffic closer to the curb. One wonders whether small entry courtyards could have been used in a manner similar to that at Manhattan brownstone buildings.
While these exterior modifications can help make ground-floor units more attractive to residents, the fact they are on the ground floor has its own appeal. For example, residents and their pets can reach units and parking without having to use an elevator. Home offices are more accessible to daytime visitors. Ground-floor spaces can have significantly taller ceilings, which might accommodate small loft spaces and, when the market improves, retail conversion. Floors can be solid concrete, lending more permanence and providing more choices for floor finishes for residents. Balconies of units on the second floor can provide covered arcades for ground-floor units.
Retail in Flexible Sizes
Another problem with convertible retail or residential space is its size. Not all retailers can fit into a space that can accommodate a small residential unit. Others may need the flexibility to expand if they do well, or to contract if they do not. Fixed demising walls can unduly constrain needed flexibility. JHP provided flexibility by building retail units in modular sizes that can expand or contract while still fitting in with the housing modules above. They determined that neighborhood-scale, flexible retail spaces could share a 30-foot (9 m) depth and be built in modular frontage widths of 24, 36, and 48 feet (7, 11, 15 m). These 720-, 864-, and 1,420-square-foot (67, 80, 132 sq m) sizes could accommodate most prospective retail tenants while being more attractive for developers, retailers, and communities because they offer lower rents, require less parking, and integrate well into a mixed retail/residential development that seeks to cater to the smaller service, café, and specialty businesses that residents hope will serve their urban neighborhoods.
Building at such small sizes can incorporate strategies to reduce costs for design, construction, and tenant improvements. Retail construction costs rise with the use of steel structures or elevated concrete podium designs that are common in urban mixed-use buildings. JHP devised a method to use only less-expensive wood-frame construction. The parking at Oaks 5th Street Crossing is in a central bar structure that has no housing above or retail below, lowering fire protection and ventilation costs. JHP designed the structures using strategically placed engineered wood beams and columns to create open and flexible retail spaces within the modules while significantly reducing construction cost. In addition to increasing permissible spans, the depth of the engineered wood members can allow space for air intake equipment for retail spaces, which must occur at the front of the building. This method can also create a wider spandrel that is high enough to accommodate signs for the shops.
A more cost-effective way of creating flexibility in the space is building ten-foot-wide (3 m) wood headers beneath party walls. This allows retail tenants to knock out the drywall and link retail spaces, as well as limits the number of structural columns, further reducing cost. Sleeves under the slab leading to the plumbing cores can later accommodate grease trap locations beneath the front parking, allowing the space to house cafés and restaurants without demolition and disruption to install the traps. Floor-to-ceiling glazing systems can be easily modified to increase the size of front openings of cafés.
Public/Private Partnerships
To the extent that such projects are public/private partnerships, the public partner may choose to lease ground-floor retail space until the time is ripe to convert it to office space. Garland is considering doing so in connection with the second phase of Oaks 5th Street Crossing in order to operate the space efficiently in conjunction with city hall across the street.
Union at Carrollton Square
In Carrollton, 14 miles (23 km) northwest of Dallas and a similar distance west of Garland, is Union at Carrollton Square, a TOD flex retail project developed by Trammell Crow Company as a catalyst to spur development in a neglected part of the city. It is positioned on six acres (2.4 ha) adjacent to the city's historic downtown district and the rail station on DART's Green Line expansion. The project, positioned at the first of three DART stops in Carrollton, includes 295 residential units, 10,500 square feet (980 sq m) of flex retail space, and a 460-space, five-level parking garage. The public/private partnership project is on a former lumberyard that the city acquired, and the city is funding the public improvements and the parking garage. Here, JHP plans 60-foot-deep (18 m) retail spaces using a combination of wood framing and steel columns, which yielded significant savings compared with a typical concrete podium.
Half the ground-floor space was programmed as live/work units planned for cost-effective conversion to retail space as needed. Solid materials, tall ceiling heights, frequent pilasters, divided glazing systems, special light fixtures, and a covered arcade articulate spaces that can be either retail or residential at the Union at Carrollton. A courtyard with a bronze sculpture is accessible to the public through a controlled arcade.
Public/private partnership projects such as these do not address the decline in smaller retailers occasioned by the domination and consolidation of large retailers or the explosive growth in online retailing. But they do offer an alternative location for all those who value the growth of mixed-use urban places and lifestyles in more walkable environments in revitalized suburban cities. Though the retail components of such places are small, they can still house services like cafés, pubs, and bistros that online alternatives cannot, as well as offer these businesses a means to expand.

Skype even gave a small group of journalists, myself included, a look at a behind-the-scenes video in which Sir Paul taps on keyboard keys, strums their guitar, and murmurs sounds, all a part of the Moji creation process.
Apart from a label that states this group of Mojis was created by McCartney, they don't include any distinguishing characteristics of McCartney (or The Beatles). Skype says it went through many iterations of these emoticons and decided that it wanted to create new expressive content that paired with McCartney's original music, but did not want to overburden the message.
Skype first introduced partner-driven custom emoji in September of last year, rolling out around 150 different video clips and animation options from Universal Studios, BBC, and the Disney Muppets. And in October, it added clips from popular Bollywood TV shows and movies, along with emoji honoring Indian food, holidays, and traditions.
The inclusion of culturally-relevant and celebrity-branded content is clearly part of Skype's larger strategy to keep people using its messaging platform, which is still considered the go-to video chat application for many but on the mobile side has been surpassed by apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and WeChat. Skype doesn't break out user numbers for video, audio, and text messaging functions across desktop and mobile, but does say that its users have made more than 3 billion minutes of calls in one day on Skype.
The new Love Mojis become available on Skype today, and are free, because obviously you can't buy me love. (Sorry.)
Florida State coach Jimbo Fisher has shied away from comparing Deondre Francois and Jameis Winston, the most recent redshirt first-year student quarterback to start for the Seminoles.
But it is hard to avoid comparisons to their respective offenses.
FSU's Deondre Francois might not have quite as strong a receiving corps as Jameis Winston did when they started as a redshirt first-year student in 2013, but the Seminoles' running game should be better in 2016. Logan Bowles/USA TODAY Sports
Like Winston in 2013, Francois will not have to go it alone in their first career start. There are veterans at every position on offense, and that should not be underplayed headed into the Sept. 5 opener against Ole Miss. Fisher has said many times that having an experienced group around Winston helped their development (that 25-of-27 passing debut against Pitt was a huge help, too).
Let us take a look, then, at what Florida State returned on offense in 2013, and what it returns in 2016.
Running back: In 2013, Devonta Freeman and James Wilder returned as a nice 1-2 combo. In 2016, the Seminoles are much stronger here, with Dalvin Cook back after rushing for 1,691 yards and 19 touchdowns last season. In all likelihood, teams are going to try to load the box to slow down Cook and make Francois try and beat them.
But the Seminoles essentially return every single receiver who took a meaningful snap last season (more on them in a minute), and Francois showed during the spring game they have what it takes to make the clutch throws when the heat is on (caveat noted that spring games do not, by their nature, apply much heat). Fisher also reported Francois had “quite a few touchdown passes” during a scrimmage Wednesday.
Receiver/tight end: Rashad Greene, Kenny Shaw, Kelvin Benjamin and Nick O'Leary all returned to help Winston and the offense top 4,000 yards in the pass game. Greene and Benjamin each went over 1,000 yards that season; Shaw nearly did. While the group Florida State returns for 2016 is not as consistent, there is major potential. Travis Rudolph has the capability to be an All-ACC receiver; Bobo Wilson and Kermit Whitfield have a ton of experience, and Auden Tate reminds many of Benjamin. Ryan Izzo also returns at tight end, though they have work to do to get to O'Leary's level.
Offensive line: Florida State returned one of its best offensive lines in 2013, featuring ACC Jacobs Blocking Trophy recipient Cam Erving at left tackle. The Seminoles have all starters returning in 2016, headlined by ACC Jacobs Blocking Trophy recipient Rod Johnson at left tackle. Pretty important that both Winston and Francois have elite tackles blocking their respective blind sides. While the returning Florida State offensive line is not as good as the one the Noles had headed into the 2013 season, Fisher believes this will be a vastly improved group as 2016 goes on.
Florida State returns more starters on offense in 2016 than it did in 2013. And the expectations are higher for this team going into the season. Florida State started '13 at No. 11 in the preseason ranking. The Noles already are No. 4 in the coaches' poll.
There is no denying the amount of talent returning. And there is no denying the 2013 comparison, either. At least on offense.
Top earners, Kenneth Griffin and James Simons, made $1.7bn each despite ‘hedge fund killing field' on Wall Street where many companies lost billions or closed
The world's top 25 hedge fund managers earned $13bn last year – more than the entire economies of Namibia, the Bahamas or Nicaragua.
Kenneth Griffin, founder and chief executive of Citadel, and James Simons, founder and chairperson of Renaissance Technologies, shared the top spot, taking home $1.7bn each – equivalent to the annual salaries of 112,000 people taking home the US federal minimum wage of $15,080.
The earnings of the best-performing hedge fund managers, published by Institutional Investor's Alpha magazine on Tuesday, dwarfs the pay of top Wall Street executives who have been under fire for their multimillion-dollar pay deals. The best paid banker last year was JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who collected $27m.
The huge pay at the top comes despite a tumultuous year on Wall Street that has led many well-known hedge funds to lose billions of dollars and others to close down. Daniel Loeb, CEO of Third Point, a hedge fund that manages $17.5bn, has described market conditions as a “hedge fund killing field”.
Despite the challenges, Simons and Griffin managed to increase their earnings by $500m and $400m, respectively, compared with last year.
Both men have poured a lot of money into the presidential race, but both backed Republicans who dropped out. Griffin, who is the richest man in Illinois with a $7.5bn fortune according to Forbes, has donated more than $3m into the failed campaigns of Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush and Scott Walker.
Griffin, 47, who started from their dorm at Harvard University, was the biggest single donor to Rahm Emanuel's successful campaign for a second term as mayor of Chicago.
They have rarely spoken about their political inclinations, but in 2012 they described themselves as a “Reagan Republican” and said they thought the rich had “insufficient influence” on the political process. When Emanuel announced the closure of 50 schools, Griffin said they should have closed 125.
Griffin recently spent $500m buying Jackson Pollock's Number 17A and Willem de Kooning's Interchanged from the entertainment mogul David Geffen. They have loaned the paintings to the Art Institute of Chicago.
Simons, a string theory expert and former cold war codebreaker, has made an estimated $15.5bn from Renaissance Technologies the mathematics-driven “quant” hedge fund they set up 34 years ago.
The fund, which is run from the tiny Long Island village of Setauket where Simons owns a huge beachfront compound, has donated $13m to Cruz's failed campaign. With Cruz out of the race, Renaissance has switched donations to Hillary Clinton, with more than $2m donated so far. Euclidean Capital, Simon's family office, has donated more than $7m to Clinton.
Simons, 78, who retired as CEO of Renaissance in 2009, is the 50th richest person in the world, according to Forbes. Their earnings last year were so large that if they were a country it would rate as the world's 178th most productive nation, according to the World Bank's GDP rankings.
They have donated millions of dollars to maths and science education via the Simons Foundation they set up in 1994.
No woman has yet made it into the top 25 of the hedge fund highest-paid list, which has been running for 15 years. Hedge fund managers typically get paid based on a structure known as “two and 20”, in which they collect a 2% fee on the assets they manage and earn 20% of the profits they make for investors.
“What was I thinking!?”
It was the logical next step for my band Living Illusion. We had played tons of local shows, did some minor touring and gained a little buzz, so we decided it was time to get serious. Our first album was an experiment more than anything and considering it was self recorded & produced it sounded pretty good. For our next album, we wanted more. It was time to throw our best material out there and build a future for the band. Go big or go home.
To be honest we could have gone “bigger”, but seeing as I, solely was the financial backer on the project we kept going until I literally ran out of money. Initially when we decided to record our second album “Suffering” it was only supposed to cost around $10k, but once production started it became a never ending slew of unforeseen expenses. Going through 3 different mixers had to be the most expensive addition.
Ultimately, I learned a lot from the process but it's scary to look back at how naive I was. Full of piss and vinegar, I wanted to get the best product out there to the world, assuming that this would lead us to success. Knowing the production quality of our first album was so lackluster comparatively only further exasperated the ideals of “getting the best production”. It also didn't help when you get so far in over your head that you think, “What's another $3k I already spent $10k”.
If there were one thing I would've done differently it would've been to save some money for marketing and promotions. The life lessons I want to share with other aspiring musicians and bands out there is surrounding budgets and marketing. Knowing when and where to spend, or not spend your money. I recommend saving your money on production and make albums yourself or at small studios until you have a big enough following to justify spending the money.
We've hit a cross road where more quality music is being produced than ever before and a person interests & tastes can be more hyper specified then ever. Giving access to your music has become easier for indie bands, but that's not where the problem lies. It's about getting it in front of the right people that like your style, then making them a fan and hopefully a customer. You have to seek out your fans now. No one will be googling your band unless you give them a reason to.
Maybe I'm alone on this or maybe people just don't like my band and our style of music, and that's okay too. I just hope that I can provide insight to other bands out there based from my experience. When it comes down to it, I just want the people out there who enjoy hard rock to hear our songs and decide for themselves.
That being said here is a copy of the last Living Illusion album Suffering for all you awesome folks that read my blog to download and enjoy for free:
(Just click the link and the download will start / it may take a second / no need to right-click)
And here's the first Album because people were asking for it:

The continued support from you guys is what keeps us going.
Much love,

WASHINGTON/KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump publicly appealed on Saturday for Saudi Arabia to list national oil company Saudi Aramco's shares in New York, intervening in a battle among the world's top stock exchanges.

“Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Important to the United States!”
Trump did not say why they raised the issue at this time or whether they were responding to any information about the NYSE's bid. But by describing the listing as a priority for Washington, they could help sway the Saudis' decision.
The Saudi government, seeking to raise money as low oil prices strain its finances, plans to sell about 5 percent of Aramco next year in a sale officials say could raise about $100 billion, making it the world's largest initial public offer ever.
Saudi authorities have said they intend to list Aramco in Riyadh and on one or more foreign exchanges, setting off a competition among New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo and other bourses.
An Aramco spokesperson had no comment on Trump's tweet, while a spokesperson for the NYSE declined to comment.
NYSE Group president Thomas Farley said at a conference in Riyadh last week that they had not given up on the IPO and was in talks with Saudi authorities.
The London Stock Exchange has also received some government support for its bid, although that has been less public. Prime Minister Theresa May and the chief of the LSE pitched investments in Britain to the head of Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund on a visit to Riyadh earlier this year.
While Trump's tweet named the New York Stock Exchange, it did not mention rival Nasdaq Inc, which is also vying for the Aramco listing.
“Generally, public servants should be impartial, not give preferential treatment to anyone, and avoid endorsements,” said Scott Amey, general counsel for the government ethics watchdog Project on Government Oversight in Washington. “We have already seen violations in this administration, and it doesn't help that the president isn't leading by example.”
Nasdaq replied to Trump in a tweet, saying it agreed the United States was the “best destination for global companies” but that Aramco belongs on Nasdaq “with the 5 most valuable operating companies in the world.”
AWAITING A DECISION
Nearly two years after announcing their plan to sell Aramco shares, Saudi officials say they have not yet decided on foreign listing venues.
Sources told Reuters in August that Riyadh favored New York for Aramco's main foreign listing. But some financial and legal advisers have recommended London as a less problematic and risky option.
Aramco's lawyers warned about litigation risks associated with the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA. Passed last year, the law allows the Saudi government to be sued on the grounds that it helped to plan the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, an allegation which Riyadh denies.
Mohammed al-Sabban, who has been an adviser to former Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, told Reuters that Trump's intervention would not resolve the JASTA problem.
“President Trump has forgotten completely that the risks of implementing the JASTA law against Saudi assets are still there,” Sabban said.
“Probably during their administration they could prevent any case against Saudi Arabia. However, when President Trump's term ends, this will raise fears that the JASTA law could still be applied.”
Still, Trump may be able to wield diplomatic clout in Riyadh. Saudi leaders welcomed them warmly during a visit to the kingdom in May, partly because they have taken a tough stance against their nation's diplomatic archrival Iran, and Riyadh is eager for close military ties with Washington.
“President Trump's tweet indicates that, from the White House's perspective at least, a public listing of Aramco is not as dead as some recent reports indicated,” said Bob McNally, president of Washington-based energy market and policy consultant Rapidan Energy Group.

“The tweet suggests the White House believes Saudi Arabia may be approaching a decision on where to list and wishes to either claim credit or push a possibly wavering Saudi Arabia for a New York listing,” McNally added.
Exchanges hosting Aramco can look forward to a boost in fee income from trading the stock. The prestige associated with the company may help them attract more big listings, including IPOs of other state companies from the Gulf as governments there sell assets in an era of cheap oil.
Catholic Church hierarchy admits concerns over Maynooth seminary BelfastTelegraph.co.uk Ireland's Catholic Church hierarchy has admitted concerns about an "unhealthy atmosphere" at the country's main seminary amid claims trainee priests there are using the gay dating app Grindr. https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/catholic-church-hierarchy-admits-concerns-over-maynooth-seminary-34991914.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/article34991913.ece/f0b4a/AUTOCROP/h342/PANews%20BT_P-b0c074e5-b5f7-499c-ac26-2d6d2ed10cff_I1.jpg

Ireland's Catholic Church hierarchy has admitted concerns about an "unhealthy atmosphere" at the country's main seminary amid claims trainee priests there are using the gay dating app Grindr.
Church leaders have ordered a review on the "appropriate use of the internet and social media" at the centuries-old St Patrick's College in Maynooth, Co Kildare, as well as an overhaul of its approach to whistleblowers.
The college trustees - four Archbishops and 13 senior Bishops - met for crisis talks after the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin confirmed they were boycotting the seminary.
Dr Diarmuid Martin, the most senior Catholic in the Irish Republic, said earlier this month they are sending student priests to Rome rather than Maynooth - just 26 km (16 miles) from the capital.
The church leader said they made the decision some months ago because they were "somewhat unhappy" about "an atmosphere that was growing in Maynooth" exposed through anonymous accusations in letters and online blogs.
Dr Martin said allegations included "a homosexual, a gay culture, that students have been using an app called Grindr" which they said "would be fostering promiscuous sexuality".
The Archbishop said there were further allegations that whistleblowers trying to bring claimed wrongdoing to the attention of authorities were being dismissed from the seminary.
After a meeting in Maynooth, the four Archbishops and 13 Bishops that oversee the seminary said they acknowledged the controversy and the disquiet it has caused in the church in Ireland.
"The trustees share the concerns about the unhealthy atmosphere created by anonymous accusations together with some social media comments which can be speculative or even malicious," they said in a statement.
"Persons with specific concerns are encouraged to report them appropriately as soon as possible."
The trustees have vowed to carry out a review of whistle-blowing policies and procedures and will demand college authorities review the use of the internet and social media.
They will also call on the church to set up an independent audit into the running of both remaining Irish seminaries, Maynooth and St Malachy's in Belfast.
Founded in 1795, Maynooth College was once the largest seminary in the world.
It was built to train 500 trainee Catholic priests every year, but numbers have nosedived to just over 40 for the coming year with a fall-off in vocations.
Speaking earlier this month, Dr Martin also criticised the "comfortable" regime at the seminary.
"The people have their breakfast, dinner and tea served up to them," they said.
By now, you've probably stopped sobbing over this week's episode of The Walking Dead — probably! — and, if that's so, it means two things: 1) You need some Visine. And 2) you have questions.
To answer them, TVLine turns to Sarah Wayne Callies, whose final scenes as ill-fated Lori Grimes were as beautiful — and as horrifying — as any we've ever seen.
In the following Q&A with TVLine, the actor opens up about lying to the world for five months, their biggest regret about leaving the show, why they believe Lori's final wish was the right one, whether they will continue to watch the show and much more.
TVLINE | Your performance last night was amazing, but I have to say, what really impressed me was that you kept this secret for so long. You shot the episode in June, which means you had to basically lie your way through Comic-Con.
It was the single hardest thing of this entire process, knowing that I had to [keep quiet] from the middle of June until the middle of November. And then I had to work on another project, [the film Black Sky]. I got onto that set and there were a lot of people who were fans of the show that were like, “Aren't you shooting right now?” And I basically told them that every character this season has more episodes off than they've ever had, and the writers were kind enough to accommodate this schedule — all of which is true. But it was also deliberately misleading. It was by far the hardest thing. But [AMC] was very clear: You can tell your mom, you can tell your husband, and that's basically it. [Laughs] It was a real challenge. I think we were all very conscious of the ways in which Shane's death got out [before the episode aired]. And while it didn't diminish [Jon Bernthal's] performance, I think it diminished the experience of the audience watching it. So the publicity team at AMC said, “Look, we're going to keep working like you are still the leading lady of the show for the rest of the season. And then when you die it's going to be crazy.” And it seems like that worked. To be honest, I can't believe it. I'm floored.
RELATED | Walking Dead Exec Producer Robert Kirkman Reveals Why Lori Had to Die
TVLINE | I was looking back at the interview I did with you at Comic-Con [scroll down for video] and I actually asked you what it will be like when the inevitable day comes when Lori dies — and you lied to my face. Well done.
Well, I do lie for a living. [Laughs] I'm an actor.
TVLINE | I want to ask you about the choice Lori made to sacrifice their own life to save them child's. What would you say to those folks who think it was a selfish decision to saddle Rick with not one but two children in the apocalypse?
I think that's ridiculous. [Laughs] She's providing the most powerful symbol of hope and renewal that exists — which is this idea that life can go on and can grow, even in the midst of the end of the world. They were also losing about a cup of blood a minute. And if you can't deliver the baby and you can't stop the bleeding then she's dying one way or the other. As soon as the blood hit Maggie's hand Lori knows she's not leaving the boiler room. And if they die and the baby dies then the baby turns. So then someone's going to have to put a bullet in that baby. They realize that one of them could potentially come out of this alive or they could both die for sure. And given how hard Rick has worked to protect Lori and the baby, the greatest gift they can give them at that point is at least the success with the baby. They did it. They did it. They got them to term; they kept the baby alive.
TVLINE | Were you on set for the climactic scene in the prison yard where Rick learns that Lori died.
Andy [Lincoln] asked me not to be on set. But I couldn't leave, so I was at base camp with the trailers. I could hear them screaming and crying [while shooting the scene]. I was sitting there with IronE Singleton [T-Dog] kind of going, “Oh my God. This is horrible.” And then one by one as the scene ended they came back to the trailers to change and go home, and I put my arms around Andy. When they go down the rabbit hole they go all the way down. I put my arms around them and I was like, “Look at me. I'm right here. I'm alive! Andy and Sarah are just fine. Rick and Lori are over, but Andy and Sarah are just fine.” [Laughs]
TVLINE | What did you think of that particular scene when you saw it for the first time?
I thought it was brilliant. I thought it was brilliantly shot to have Carl strong and cold in the foreground and Rick collapsed. I know they shot it a bunch of different ways. There were a bunch of different ideas about how that scene could play. But it was beautiful because in some ways it's the apotheosis of Carl. It's this young boy having just performed a great act of both mercy and violence [against] their mother recognizing that dad's not going to be able to get me through this right now, so I'll be the strong one.
TVLINE | Is there any part of you that's bummed you never got to play a zombie?
[Hesitates]. No. [Laughs] Not really at all. The only regret that I have about that is that [Walking Dead special effects guru] Greg Nicotero has these amazing stylized posters made of the people who have left the show as zombies, and the one of Jon is phenomenal. And I asked him, “Do I get a poster?! I want a poster!” And they were like, “You didn't turn into a zombie.” But I remember Jon telling me that the zombie transformation is so hard. We spend the entire show hating them and running from them and trying to kill them. And to watch that transformation would be incredibly difficult. Greg has told me that they've had people weep in the chair. Some grown-up actors needed a scotch. It's an emotional transformation. And I think maybe I've had enough emotion already. [Laughs]
TVLINE | Will you watch the show as a fan now?
Yes. I'm kind of looking forward to it [because] it'll be the first time I'll be watching without knowing what's going to happen. I get really easily scared, so I may have to watch from across the room with a pillow over my eyes for some of it. [Laughs] But they are phenomenal actors. Especially David [Morrissey]. The stuff he's doing this season [as the Governor] is just blowing me away. One of my biggest regrets is that I don't get to work with him. We were both really looking forward to working together.
TVLINE | Are you interested in another TV gig? And, if so, would you be looking for something, um, a touch lighter?
My mom and my best friend have both asked that the next thing I'm in involve ponies and rainbows. [Laughs] To be perfectly honest, I can't imagine anybody casting a sitcom going, “I know — we need Sarah Wayne Callies!” [Laughs] If I was looking to star in the next 2 Broke Girls I don't think anyone would take me seriously. That said, a good script is a good script. And whether it's television or theater or feature films, you go where the writing is. I shot Black Sky over the summer and right now I'm not doing anything. [Laughs] I'm taking off for the holidays. But starting in January, they'll send me a bunch of scripts and I'll read them and see which ones I love and see which ones love me. And we'll figure out what comes next.

Yahoo on Thursday revealed a massive data breach of its services.
Yahoo "has confirmed that a copy of certain user account information was stolen from the company's network in late 2014 by what it believes is a state-sponsored actor," the company posted on its investor relations page.
The stolen data include names, email addresses, telephone numbers, birthdays, hashed passwords, and some "encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers." Yahoo says it believes no payment card or bank account information was stolen.
Yahoo said it believes that at least 500 million user account credentials were stolen, which would make it the biggest breach of all time — bigger than the Myspace breach of 360 million user accounts and 427 million passwords.
The breach has turned out to be larger than the 200 million accounts previously expected.
Recode's Kara Swisher reported on Thursday that the breach could have implications for the $4.8 billion sale of Yahoo to Verizon, and that some shareholders may fear that it could change the price of the transaction.
Verizon released this statement:
Yahoo says there is no evidence that the hacker still has access to Yahoo's network or internal services.
Here's the entire message from Yahoo:
"A recent investigation by Yahoo! Inc. has confirmed that a copy of certain user account information was stolen from the company's network in late 2014 by what it believes is a state-sponsored actor. The account information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords (the vast majority with bcrypt) and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. The ongoing investigation suggests that stolen information did not include unprotected passwords, payment card data, or bank account information; payment card data and bank account information are not stored in the system that the investigation has found to be affected. Based on the ongoing investigation, Yahoo believes that information associated with at least 500 million user accounts was stolen and the investigation has found no evidence that the state-sponsored actor is currently in Yahoo's network. Yahoo is working closely with law enforcement on this matter.
"Yahoo is notifying potentially affected users and has taken steps to secure their accounts. These steps include invalidating unencrypted security questions and answers so that they cannot be used to access an account and asking potentially affected users to change their passwords. Yahoo is also recommending that users who haven't changed their passwords since 2014 do so.
"Yahoo encourages users to review their online accounts for suspicious activity and to change their password and security questions and answers for any other accounts on which they use the same or similar information used for their Yahoo account. The company further recommends that users avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails and that they be cautious of unsolicited communications that ask for personal information. Additionally, Yahoo asks users to consider using Yahoo Account Key, a simple authentication tool that eliminates the need to use a password altogether.
"Online intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry. Yahoo and other companies have launched programs to detect and notify users when a company strongly suspects that a state-sponsored actor has targeted an account. Since the inception of Yahoo's program in December 2015, independent of the recent investigation, approximately 10,000 users have received such a notice.
"Additional information will be available on the Yahoo Security Issue FAQs page, beginning at 11:30 am Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) on September 22, 2016."
Why the Kickstarted Project “Red” Makes Me See Red.
William Blocked Unblock Follow Feb 22, 2014
I first heard about Kickstarter through my love for the Delaware St. John adventure series back in April 2012. That campaign did not succeed, unfortunately.
The next time I visited Kickstarter was for “Red”, a movie that was going to star Jodelle Ferland and have Claudia Christian in a supporting role. The director, Danielle Colman (more often known as Director Dani or DirectorDaniC), was an unknown factor and I didn't know the production company either. But based on those two actores I decided to pledge to the campaign.
The campaign was the second one for this movie as the first one didn't generate the $50k intended. The second campaign, the one I pledged to, was launched with a target of $25k. During the first campaign and most of the second (less than with the first campaign) the director was active on the project pages with vlogs, interviews with the stars and such to keep every backer up to date. At the end of the second Kickstarter that changed: no countdown livestream, due to the director being unwell. Them final vlog was a few days before when the project crossed the $25k line. On August 24, 2012, the project was successfully funded and had raised $28,075.
After that, updates became almost non-existent. On October 13, 2012, Dani mentioned on Twitter that there was a lot going on behind the scenes. After that they didn't post a new update until the end of February 2013 after former producer Ben Yennie of Films by Neptune mentioned on Kickstarter that their company had parted ways with Ms. Colman months before and that they felt they had an obligation to mention that they and their company had nothing to do with the movie anymore. In their update, Dani admitted that Films by Neptune isn't involved anymore and that it is proving difficult to get enough money for the film. Nowhere did they acknowledge that they had the obligation of keeping the backers informed about crucial information like changing production companies and failing to secure enough funds to get it made. In fact, they implied that they didn't have any intent of keeping the backers informed of what was being done behind the scenes when they said, “ It's slow, boring, frustrating work — and it doesn't lend itself well to frequent updates…”
Since then they haven't posted a single update to the Kickstarter page and never mentioned the film again on their Twitter feed. Sognetto Films' website (it only had a second-rate copy of the original Films By Neptune page on “Red”) was left to expire. And recently, Dani deleted their personal Facebook page and deleted the films Facebook page.
Finally getting fed up with the lack of any news from her, I asked them on Twitter if there was any news on the project, since I noticed on IMDB that the status of the movie was in post-production since July 2013. In their reply dated October 21, 2013, they mentioned they might have some information to share after the American Film Market (AFM) in November 2013. When I asked them about any news after the AFM was over they never replied and blocked me from following them on Twitter.
Meanwhile on the Kickstarter page two people, who themselves are involved in filmmaking, started wondering about the lack of updates. One even offered Dani help in getting the movie made. However, they did not receive any reply whatsoever from them Another started to ask some very valid questions:
‘I'm feeling incredibly frustrated with this project. I've reached out repeatedly for the past two months to the director, Dani Colman, and have not received an answer. I decided to look again at the home page of the Kickstarter project to see if they have kept them promises.
First off, this is what was promised regarding updates:
“Anyone can pledge to the project, and in return we keep you informed about our efforts….”
To date, there has been NO effort to keep us informed about the efforts being made with this project.
Here's what they said they were going to do with the money we gave her:
“$25,000 is only a fraction of our full budget, and it's not enough to make the whole film. But what it is enough to do is take care of a few key things that will persuade our other investors to come on board. Firstly, we'll be using the money to attach an actor to the lead male role and round out our amazing cast. We'll also use the money to kick pre-production into high gear, so that by the time we get to shooting we'll be ready to put something truly incredible on film.”
Pre-production should have been kicked into high gear long ago. So where are the storyboards? Where are the designs for sets and costumes? What locations have been scouted and/or secured? Has “Red” been promoted at fan conventions to gain more support? Where is the website for “Red”? Where is the Facebook page for the movie? Does the movie have a Twitter feed? Where can supporters sign up for the mailing list for the movie? What efforts are being made to raise the rest of the funds?
These are just a few of things that should be happening during pre-production. Why aren't we being informed?'”
Dani still couldn't be bothered to reply. After posting their grievances via Facebook, Amanda Rogers managed to get their money back.
Inspired by this I embarked on a quest for a refund. Mailing via Kickstarter yielded no reply. When I sent a message via Amazon Payments, I got a reply from Films By Neptune that Dani had all the funds, but that the Amazon Payments info still pointed to Films By Neptune and couldn't be changed. After some searching I found Dani's email address online while researching their defunct website.
In December 2013, I e-mailed Dani about a refund, citing the rules regarding Kickstarter they had violated:
“After months of little to no updates about the project and you're banning me from following you on Twitter I have reached the end of my patience with this project. I request a refund on the grounds of a failure to comply with reasonable expectations re: communication on project status. The lack of communications leads me to believe that the project is not expected to be completed at all.
From the Kickstarter 101 faq:'
'What should creators do if they're having problems completing their project?
If problems come up, creators are expected to post a project update (which is emailed to all backers) explaining the situation. Sharing the story, speed bumps and all, is crucial. Most backers support projects because they want to see something happen and they'd like to be a part of it. Creators who are honest and transparent will usually find backers to be understanding.
It's not uncommon for things to take longer than expected. Sometimes the execution of the project proves more difficult than the creator had anticipated. If a creator is making a good faith effort to complete their project and is transparent about it, backers should do their best to be patient and understanding while demanding continued accountability from the creator.
If the problems are severe enough that the creator can't fulfill their project, creators need to find a resolution. Steps could include offering refunds, detailing exactly how funds were used, and other actions to satisfy backers.'
‘and'
'Is a creator legally obligated to fulfill the promises of their project?
Yes. Kickstarter's Terms of Use require creators to fulfill all rewards of their project or refund any backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. (This is what creators see before they launch.) We crafted these terms to create a legal requirement for creators to follow through on their projects, and to give backers a recourse if they don't. We hope that backers will consider using this provision only in cases where they feel that a creator has not made a good faith effort to complete the project and fulfill.'
‘I hope to receive a reply and/or a refund in a timely manner.”
Initially, I received a reply from them asking for my Paypal address and the amount pledged. After that I neither received a refund nor did they e-mail me back, not even when I started sending frequent reminders. In January 2014, I got so fed up with the constant disrespect of the so-called director towards me, one of the backers they so desperately sought during the Kickstarter campaign, that I e-mailed them that I would report them to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3.gov). That got them attention. They replied that they had filed a report on me for harassment, claiming that since they didn't give their e-mail address to me it was inappropriate for me to use it to contact them (However, I acquired it on a publicly visible website detailing the registration information they used while setting up sognettofilms.com; so any privacy was waived by them as they should have known any such registration data is publicly visible).
Dani claims the money is in a high interest savings account to “best protect the interest of the backers”, (something they obviously don't give a darn about since they had been keeping everyone in the dark for months). They then gave an “explanation” for why the refund had stalled: the type of account meant there was no quick way to get at the money, and the holiday season stalled it even more. (Really? From my initial e-mail to this reply there were only two Federal holidays: Christmas and New Year). They then said my “harassment” of them hadn't given them an incentive to hasten the procedure. They also mentioned they would no longer receive any mail at their e-mail address.
After that I never heard from them again. From the posts on their Twitter account it seems their only activities on the social media front is writing essays on medium.com.
Them total disregard of and disdain towards their backers is astounding and not befitting a director and/or writer — alienating the people they want and needs to make their films a success. Them IMDB page has some dubious credits that cannot be backed up by reliable (or even unreliable sources).
Where does this leave the “Red” project? It might have started out as a legitimate Kickstarter project, but it seems that after parting ways with the original production company it was abandoned. The lack of updates as well as Dani's efforts to shut down every means of communication from their backers makes me suspect fraud. If they treat their Kickstarter backers this way, how can they expect to attract high net worth investors (that would never put up with this kind of behavior)? My guess is that they never will. Them only chance of redeeming themselves is to admit their failures and refund all monies to all their backers.
If Dani Colman ever tries another crowdfunding campaign, avoid it like the plague as they are not interested in keeping backers informed and is not interested in being accountable in any way.
