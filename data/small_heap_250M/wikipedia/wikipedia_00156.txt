The 1995–96 Pittsburgh Penguins season saw the return of Mario Lemieux after missing an entire season due to injuries. The Penguins improved to first in the Northeast Division and second overall in the Eastern Conference. In the 1996 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Penguins progressed to the Conference Finals before losing to the Florida Panthers.
Off-season
Regular season
Mario Lemieux's return to the NHL after missing the entire 1994–95 season energized the Penguins and re-instituted the team's finesse game for the 1995–96 season. The Penguins finished second in the Eastern Conference with 102 points, leading all League teams in goals (362), even-strength goals (235), power-play goals (109), power-play percentage (25.95%) and shooting percentage while scoring 362 goals on just 2,645 shots (13.7%). Despite missing 12 regular-season games, Lemieux led the NHL in goals (69), assists (92), points (161) power-play goals (31) and shorthanded goals (8). Czech superstar Jaromir Jagr had a career year, scoring 62 goals (second in the League), 87 assists (third in the League) and 149 points (second in the League). The third 100-point scorer on the team was Ron Francis, who tallied 27 goals and 92 assists (tied for first in the NHL with Lemieux) for 119 points. Petr Nedved scored 45 goals and had 54 assists for 99 points in 80 games—he finished second in the NHL in shooting percentage, with 22.1%. Despite missing over a quarter of the season, Tomas Sandstrom also had a strong year, scoring 35 goals and picking up 35 assists for 70 points in 58 games.
Lemieux scored three goals or more in a game six times, and four goals or more in a game twice. On March 26, 1996, he scored five goals in a home game against the St. Louis Blues. Lemieux tallied two even-strength goals, two power-play goals and one short-handed goal in the game, which the Penguins won 8–4.

In 1954, one of them, a dentist named Ray Paull, adopted Shin and took him home to Salt Lake City, Utah. Despite never having been educated in Korea, and knowing little English, Shin completed a GED in 18 months. Shin went on to earn a BA in political science from Brigham Young University, an MPIA from the University of Pittsburgh, and an MA and PhD from the University of Washington.
Political career
After being elected to the Washington State House of Representatives in 1992, Shin ran for the United States House of Representatives in Washington's 2nd district in 1994 and for Washington lieutenant governor in 1996, losing by a narrow margin in each race.

Daisies () is a 1966 Czechoslovakian surrealist comedy-drama film written and directed by Věra Chytilová. Generally regarded as a milestone of the Czechoslovak New Wave movement, it follows two young girls (Jitka Cerhová and Ivana Karbanová), both named Marie, who engage in strange pranks. Originally planned as a satire of bourgeois decadence, the movie targets those attached to rules and was referred to by Chytilová as "a necrologue about a negative way of life." Daisies also inverts the stereotypical ideas of women and redraws them to the heroines' advantage. The film is considered critical of authoritarianism, including communism and patriarchy, and it was banned from theaters or export in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.
Plot
The title sequence intersperses shots of a spinning flywheel with shots of airplanes strafing and bombing the ground.
The first scene shows Marie I and Marie II sitting in bathing suits. Creaking sounds accompany their movements and their conversation is robotic. They decide that, since the whole world is spoiled, they will be spoiled as well.
The Maries dance in front of a tree that has many different types of fruit on it. Marie II eats a peach from the tree and the Maries appear in their apartment.
Marie I goes on a date with an older man. Marie II shows up, saying she is Marie I's sister, and eats a lot of food while mocking the date and interfering with his amorous intentions. She asks when the man's train is leaving, and the trio go to the train station. Marie I gets on the train with the man before sneaking off and going home with Marie II.
The Maries go to a Prague nightclub where they upstage a 1920s-style dancing couple's floor show and annoy the patrons with their drunken antics.
Marie II attempts suicide by filling their apartment with gas, but fails because she left the window open. Marie I chastises her for wasting gas.
The Maries flirt with another man to get him to pay for their meal before seeing him off on his train. They cry when he leaves, but then break into laughter.
Marie II goes to the apartment of a man who collects butterflies. He repeatedly declares his love to her, but she just asks if there is any food around. The Maries rob a friendly female bathroom attendant.
Back at their apartment, they cut up various phallic foods while the butterfly collector declares his love for Marie II over the telephone.
When the Maries try to send off a much older man on a train, he gets off, so they board the moving train and end up leaving him at the station.
The Maries look at all of the names and phone numbers written on the walls of their apartment and try to pick a man to call. A man knocks on the door for Marie II, but Marie I teases her and she does not let him in. At a pool, each Marie tells the other that she does not like her anymore.
At their apartment, the Maries soak in a bathtub full of milk and philosophize about life and death, existence and non-existence.
In the country, a farmer fails to notice the Maries. When a group of workers riding by on bicycles ignore them, Marie II begins to wonder if they have disappeared. They decide they must exist when they pass a mess they made with stolen ears of corn. Back in their apartment, they cut each other apart with scissors.
The Maries sneak into the basement of a building. They take a mechanical dumbwaiter up several floors and find a feast that is all laid out, though no one is around. They eat the food, make a mess, and destroy the room. They swing from a chandelier, which falls from the ceiling, and are dropped into open water. They call out to a nearby boat for help, and unseen sailors reach out large logs for the Maries to grab onto. They are repeatedly lifted and dunked back in the water before they lose their grip. They say they do not want to be spoiled anymore.
The final scene shows the Maries returning to the dining room. They sweep off the soiled tablecloth, set the table with shards of plates and broken glasses, and pour the food back onto platters, while whispering about being good and hardworking so everything will be wonderful and they will be happy. When they finish, they lie on the table and say they are happy. Marie II asks Marie I to repeat this, and Marie I asks if they are pretending. Marie II says they are not. The chandelier falls on them and the film cuts to war footage, over which appears a statement dedicating the film "to those who get upset only over a stomped-upon bed of lettuce."

At the time of production, neither Karbanová nor Cerhová were professional actresses, the former being a salesclerk and the latter a student. Co-writer Ester Krumbachová described the protagonists as "a pair of silly young girls but they could just as well have been two generals."
Themes and style
Throughout the film, the two main characters serve as hyperbolical pawns for Chytilová's satirical approach to female stereotypes. There is a tangible anti-patriarchy sentiment in the film, observed through the two Maries' interactions with the men in their lives. Chytilová's extensive use of the "doll" metaphor is a means to show a male-dominated society's absurd expectations of women by overplaying their stereotypical attributions. In the beginning of the film, we see Marie 1 and Marie 2 sitting down and as they move, we hear creaking sounds as if coming from an unoiled hinge. The opening establishes the metaphor of the women behaving as marionettes. A further use of the metaphor is depicting the protagonists as shallow and empty creatures, devoid of any human quality. Usually observed in sexist narratives, women are portrayed as lesser beings and by blowing these assumptions out of proportion, Chytilová aims to show the absurdity of the "patriarchal idea of femininity". Film writer Ela Bittencourt notes that Chytilová uses "the stereotype of how women are often infantilized and as a weapon right here in this film".
The heroines as "infantilized women" with high-tone voices and their childish mannerisms is what is "expected of them" by the men in their lives as they do not realize the deliberate act both women put on.
The film was state-approved and had limitations in its production. Many conservative supporters of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia criticized the film for its appropriation of gluttony and the alleged support it shows for the heroines. In an era of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia, Chytilová was "accused of nihilism” at the time of the release of Daisies. The film was condemned to be unfit for the socialist ideas of the time. A visiting professor at Staffordshire University and author of The Czechoslovak New Wave, Peter Hames commented that the officials "objected primarily to its avant-garde form, the fact that the girls didn't provide a moral example, and they no doubt correctly saw it as an attack on establishment values". The food-fights and immense consumerism that Marie 1 and Marie 2 instigate were believed to be unrepresentative of the political agenda of the state.
The film has very little in the way of plot structure, and scenes proceed from one to the next chaotically, frequently switching between black and white, color, and filtered or tinted footage. These stylistic choices in Daisies tie back to some of its themes. Both women are seen to generate destruction anywhere they go and this is reflected in the editing and montaging of the film. This kind of editing and collage-work may also indicate the multi-facedness of the marionettes, not as the simple creatures that patriarchal societies may make them out to be.
Reception
Domestic
The film was positively received by Czech audiences and critics. Film critic Antonín J. Liehm wrote that Daisies was "a remarkable film not only for the viewers that appreciate its artistic significance, but also for those who just want to be entertained and might miss its magnitude on the first viewing". Author Milan Kundera called the film "masterly made" and wrote that the "monstrosity of the main characters was depicted elegantly, poetically, dreamlike and beautifully, but without becoming any less monstrous".
The Czech Film and Television Union awarded it the Trilobit Award for Best Czechoslovak movie of 1966. However, after being criticized by the communist MP Jaroslav Pružinec during interpellations in May 1967, the film was pulled from all major cinemas for "depicting the wanton" and was subsequently only screened in smaller venues.
International
The film was very well received in Europe. French journalist Pierre Billard, writing for L'Express, compared Daisies to Mack Sennett and Marx Brothers movies and called it "a grand celebration of absurdities with technical finesse and marvellous art direction so rarely achieved".
In the American press, the reception was mostly negative. Bosley Crowther described it in the New York Times as a "Pretentiously kookie and laboriously overblown mod farce about two playgirls who are thoroughly emptyheaded. Its stabs at humor and satire simply don't cut."
It is the highest ranked Czech film in They Shoot Pictures Don't They, an online aggregator of critic best-of lists. It was also ranked the sixth greatest film directed by a woman in a 2019 BBC poll.

The 2015 Memorial Cup (branded as the 2015 Mastercard Memorial Cup for sponsorship reasons) was a four-team round-robin format tournament that began on 22 May and ended on 31 May, 2015. It was the 97th Memorial Cup championship and determined the champion of the Canadian Hockey League (CHL). The tournament was hosted by the Quebec Remparts of Quebec City, Quebec, who won the right to host the tournament over a bid by the Chicoutimi Saguenéens. They were joined by the WHL champion Kelowna Rockets, the OHL champion Oshawa Generals, and the QMJHL champion Rimouski Océanic.
Since the inclusion of the host team in the Memorial Cup format in 1983, the 2015 edition of the Memorial Cup is the only tournament in which all four of the participating teams had previously won the Memorial Cup. The Oshawa Generals won four in 1939, 1940, 1944 & 1990, the Quebec Remparts won two in 1971 & 2006, the Kelowna Rockets won in 2004, and the Rimouski Océanic won in 2000.
The tournament ended with the Oshawa Generals winning their fifth Memorial Cup with an overtime win over the Kelowna Rockets 2–1 in the championship game. This final game of the tournament was also the last competitive hockey game played in the Colisée Pepsi before the Remparts move to the Videotron Centre in September 2015.
Round-robin standings
Kelowna, Rimouski, and Quebec finished tied for second in points. Based on the rules for 2015, the tiebreaker was a two-step process. Results from the games against Oshawa were removed and the teams' remaining goals for, divided by the sum of their goals for plus goals against, were calculated. This resulted in Kelowna (10/[10+7]=0.59) advancing directly to the semi-final (and receiving home ice advantage). In the second step, Quebec defeated Rimouski in a sudden-death tiebreaker game to advance to the semi-final.

Laura Barton – The wife of Clint Barton in the Ultimate Marvel reality. Laura had long known Clint Barton and had married him sometime prior to The Ultimates 2. Together they had three kids: Callum Barton, Lewis Barton and baby Nicole Barton. Clint would call them before every mission in case he never came back. Laura and their three children were killed when a traitor (later revealed to be Black Widow) sold them out to a black-ops team.
Laura Barton makes her live-action debut in the MCU films Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), and the Disney+ series Hawkeye (2021), portrayed by Linda Cardellini. She has three children with her husband (Cooper Barton, Lila Barton, and Nathaniel Pietro Barton).
Laura is introduced in Avengers: Age of Ultron, in which she provides Steve Rogers, Tony Stark, Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, and Thor sanctuary at her and Clint's home. Later, she greets Clint when he returns home.
In Avengers: Endgame, Laura disintegrated due to the Snap, but five years later, is restored to life. She reunites with Clint at their home, and later attends Stark's funeral.
In Hawkeye'', Laura regularly contacts Clint to check up on him while he's in New York, partially aware of his dealings with the Tracksuit Mafia, who Clint made enemies of while he was Ronin.

The CONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central American, and Caribbean Association Football) qualification stage for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa consisted of 35 national teams competing for the three berths given automatically to CONCACAF by FIFA. The United States, Mexico and Honduras qualified. The fourth-place finisher, Costa Rica, played a two-game playoff with the CONMEBOL fifth-place finisher, Uruguay, for a possible fourth berth.
Format
The First and Second Rounds reduced the 35 entrants to 24 and 12 teams, respectively. The remaining 12 teams were then placed into three Third Round groups of four, with the top two teams in each group advancing to the Fourth and final qualification group. The Third Round began in August 2008 and ended in November 2008. The top 3 teams from the Fourth Round group of 6 (held from February to October 2009) qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The 4th place team competed in a home-and-away playoff against the 5th-place team from CONMEBOL.
Seeding
The draw took place on 25 November 2007 in Durban, South Africa and it determined the fixtures for the preliminary rounds. In addition, because second round winners are paired off for the third round, the top 13 seeds have been subdivided as follows:
Pot A: The top 3 teams, who would be top seeds of each third round group.
Pot B: The next 3 teams, who would be the seconds seeds of the third round groups.
Pot C: The next 6 teams, who would receive a bye to the second round, and would not be drawn against a Pot A or Pot B team in that round.
Pot D: St. Vincent and the Grenadines, who also receive a bye in the first round, but would be paired against one of the top 12 teams in Round 2.
In the 2nd round, the 13 top-ranked CONCACAF teams from the May 2007 FIFA World Ranking joined 11 winners from the 1st Round.
First round
The 22 teams ranked 14 to 35 competed in the First Round. Teams ranked 14th–24th were randomly drawn against teams ranked 25th–35th. Teams played home and away against their opponents, except three ties: Puerto Rico–Dominican Republic, Grenada–U.S. Virgin Islands and Montserrat–Suriname, which were played over one leg in late March due to several Member Associations failing to meet the new FIFA Stadium standards and being unable to secure a home venue. The winners advanced to the Second Round.

1 Belize moved their home leg to Guatemala.
2 Both legs played in the Bahamas.
3 Played as one leg due to a lack of acceptable grounds for FIFA competition.
4 Played as one leg at Trinidad and Tobago because neither side are able to provide a suitable venue according to FIFA's guidelines.
5 Played in the United States because Anguilla's stadium is not a suitable venue.
Second round
In the Second Round, the 11 first round winners joined the 13 teams which received a bye to the Second Round. Teams ranked 1st–12th were randomly drawn against the unseeded teams (the 11 first round winners plus Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, which was ranked 13th). Teams played home and away against their opponents and the winners advanced to the next round. Matches took place in June 2008.

Third round
The winners from the Second Round were placed into three groups of four teams, where they played a double round robin home and away schedule. The top two teams from each group advanced to the Fourth Round.
Group 1
Group 2
Group 3
Fourth round
The six teams that reached the fourth round formed one double-round-robin, home-and-away group nicknamed the "Hexagonal." The top three teams qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The fourth place team qualified for a home-and-away play-off against the fifth-place team from CONMEBOL.
The allocation of teams in the draw took place in Johannesburg, South Africa on 22 November 2008.
Inter-confederation play-offs
The 4th place team played the 5th place team from the CONMEBOL (South American Zone) Qualification in a home and away play-off. The winner of this play-off qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
The draw for the order in which the two matches were played was held on 2 June 2009 during the FIFA Congress in Nassau, the Bahamas. The CONCACAF side played the first leg at home.

A Day in the Life of Dennis Day is an American old-time radio situation comedy. It was broadcast on NBC from October 3, 1946, to June 30, 1951. It is also sometimes referred to as The Dennis Day Show (not to be confused with the television program of the same name).
Format
For most of the program's time on the air, Dennis Day played a soda jerk who sang as he worked. His character was naive, innocent, and prone to making wisecracks, much like the character Day played on The Jack Benny Program. Radio historian John Dunning wrote, "His [the character's] name was Dennis Day, but not, he emphasized, the same Dennis Day as that bright young man on the air with Jack Benny." Plots often derived from problems with his girlfriend and her parents. Before the show ended, it changed to a variety format.
Being the star of his own program was a departure from Day's previous experience as a regular on Benny's show. "I'm just as scared as I was in 1939 [when he joined Benny's show]," he said. "You know, you get used to being a stooge. This one I'll have to carry myself."
Personnel
Day starred as himself in the program, which began after he was discharged from the Navy in 1946. Mildred Anderson (played at different times by Bettie Miles, Barbara Eiler, and Sharon Douglas) was Day's girlfriend. Mildred's parents, Herbert and Clara Anderson (played by Francis "Dink" Trout and Bea Benaderet, respectively), owned the boarding house in which Day lived. Homer Willoughby (played by John Brown) owned the drugstore in which Day worked.
Announcers were Frank Barton, Verne Smith, and Jimmy Wallington. Ken Carson sang for commercials. Instrumental music was by Robert Armbruster and Charles Dant. The producer was Bill Harding.

A reticule, also known as a ridicule or indispensable, was a type of small handbag or purse, similar to a modern evening bag, used mainly from 1795 to 1820.
According to the American Heritage Dictionary, the name "reticule" came from the French réticule, which in turn came from the Latin reticulum, a diminutive of rete, or "net".
The reticule became popular with the advent of Regency fashions in the late 18th century. Previously, women had carried personal belongings in pockets tied around the waist, but the columnar skirts and thin fabrics that had come into style made pockets essentially unusable. When the reticule first appeared, it was made of netting. As time went by, they were made from various fabrics, including velvet, silk, and satin.
A reticule usually had a drawstring closure at the top and was carried over the arm on a cord or chain. Reticules were made in a variety of styles and shapes and sometimes trimmed with embroidery or beading. Women often made their own reticules.

Skattejakten (in English The Treasure Hunt; this novel has been translated into English) is a Norwegian novel containing clues to a real-world treasure hunt. It is written by the author Margit Sandemo. The novel is only 124 pages long, and is possibly the shortest book the author has written. Skattejakten has not been reprinted after it was first published in 1999.
Below is an English translation of the Norwegian cover text:
Oslo, 1958. Mattis is a poor student from Lofoten. Then he meets Flora, daughter of the manager Flaten, and he falls in love with her. The manager promises that he will get Flora, if he can find the gold treasure from the days of the Second World War. Mattis didn't suspect that he was being used. But during his mission he runs into Ina, and is thrown into an incredible hunt for both treasure and love. Hidden mysteries in the novel contains the answer to the hiding place of a real treasure. This novel contains all you need to find it.Come along to the exciting treasure hunt by Margit Sandemo. You may even find a gold treasure worth 250,000 kroner!''
The book was written as a set of riddles that would lead the treasure hunters to the treasure hidden by Bladkompaniet AS, the publisher of the novel. Competitors searched for the treasure, which had been hidden somewhere in Norway. In the "treasure", a telephone number was hidden, which the lucky winner called to claim the prize. The treasure was found 11 October 1999. Margit Sandemo said in a TV-interview that even she hadn't known where the treasure had been hidden.

Prize money has long been among that of Australia's leading harness races and has often included bonuses for speed.
History
The race was held twice in 1986 due to a change of dates from January to November/December, and again in 1996 due to the postponement of the 1995 race caused by track redesign and construction. When the new track opened in 1996 the race distance was changed from one mile (1609m) to 1760m. The 2007 running was abandoned due to the Equine Influenza outbreak. The 2012 race was also delayed until April 2013 due to renovations.
Since 2009, the race has been run at Menangle Park, once again at the metric mile distance. The 1400m track length and improved design allowed for faster times. The first winner at the new circuit was New Zealander Monkey King in a track record time of 1:50.8. In 2010 Victorian pacer Smoken Up, who ran 2nd the previous year, won the race and broke the Australasian record in at time of 1:50.3 (Smoken Up has subsequently lowered that record to 1:48.5 in the Len Smith Mile, also at Menangle).
The fastest ‘miles' at Harold Park were 1:55.6 by Westburn Grant in 1990, 1:56.1 by Master Mood and 1:56.2 by Chokin. When the race distance became 1760 metres the fastest mile rates were 1:54.2 by Iraklis and 1:54.4 by Christian Cullen.
The Miracle Mile proved elusive to legendary reinsman Brian Hancock who trained one winner in Our Sir Vancelot but due to suspension was unable to drive the three-times Inter Dominion champion on the night of his win in 1997. As set out below there have been several dual winners of the flying mile - notably Smoken Up, Be Good Johnny, Sokyola, Holmes DG, Chokin, Westburn Grant and Village Kid. Champion drivers Lance Justice, Vic Frost and Tony Herlihy have won the race three times each. Kellie Kersley became the first female driver to win the race in 1996. The oldest horse to win the race was 12-year-old Double Agent.
The running of the 2022 Miracle Mile was forced to be delayed for a week from the 5th March to the 12th March after the track suffered damage due to a heavy downpour of rain between the Ainsworth Free For All (Group 1) and the Miracle Mile.

Giovanni Battista Averara (1508 – November 10, 1548) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance period. He was born in Bergamo. Little is known of this landscape painter who died at a young age from a dog bite. He painted in the style of Titian. He is mentioned by the biographer Tassi, and may be confused with Giovanni Battista de Averara.

Franz Schubert began thirteen symphonies, of which up to ten are generally numbered, but only completed seven; nonetheless, one of his incomplete symphonies, the Unfinished Symphony, is among his most popular works.
Early symphonies
By 1818, Schubert had completed 6 symphonies:
, Symphony No. 1 in D major (1813)
, Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major (1814–1815)
, Symphony No. 3 in D major (1815)
, Symphony No. 4 in C minor, Tragic (1816)
, Symphony No. 5 in B-flat major (1816)
, Symphony No. 6 in C major, Little C major (1817–1818)
There is also an early unfinished symphony:
, Symphony in D major [formerly D 997] (1811?, fragment of the first movement is extant)
Late symphonies
Apart from the Great C major (D. 944), all of Schubert's late symphony projects remained unfinished.
, Sketch of a Symphony in D major (1818, piano sketches of two movements are extant)
, Sketch of a Symphony in D major (after 1820, piano sketches of all four movements are extant)
, Symphony (No. 7) in E major (1821, sketches of all four movements are extant)
, Symphony (No. 8) in B minor, Unfinished (1822, unfinished – two complete movements and a fragment of a "Scherzo" third movement are extant; the "Entre-Acte nach dem I. Aufzug", D 797 No. 1 is possibly the fourth movement)
, Sketch of a Symphony (No. 10) in D major (1828?, piano sketches of all three movements are extant)
, Symphony (No. 9) in C major, Great C major (1825? and 1828, identical to the so-called "Gmunden-Gastein" Symphony, )
Despite the Deutsch number, D 936A is a later work than D 944.
Numbering issues
Confusion arose quite early over the numbering of Schubert's symphonies, in particular the Great C major Symphony. George Grove, who rediscovered many of Schubert's symphonies, assigned the following numbering after his 1867 visit to Vienna:
No. 7: E major, D 729 (completely sketched but not entirely scored by Schubert, with multiple historic and modern completions)
No. 8: B minor, D 759 Unfinished
No. 9: C major, D 944 Great C major
Breitkopf & Härtel, when preparing the 1897 complete works publication, originally planned to publish only complete works (which would have given the Great C major No. 7), with "fragments", including the Unfinished and the D 729 sketches, receiving no number at all. When Johannes Brahms became general editor of that project, he assigned the following numbers:
no number: E major, D 729
No. 7: C major, D 944 Great C major
No. 8: B minor, D 759 Unfinished
Some of the disagreement continued into the 20th century. George Grove in his 1908 Dictionary of Music and Musicians, assigned the Great C major as No. 10, and the Unfinished as No. 9 (it is unclear from his article which symphonies, fragmentary or otherwise, are Nos. 7 and 8).
The 1978 revision to the Deutsch catalogue leaves the order as follows:
no number: E major, D 729
No. 7: B minor, D 759 Unfinished
No. 8: C major, D 944 Great C major
As a consequence, generally available scores for the later symphonies may be published using conflicting numbers.
Grove and Sullivan also suggested that there may have been a "lost" symphony. Immediately before Schubert's death, his friend Eduard von Bauernfeld recorded the existence of an additional symphony, dated 1828 (although this does not necessarily indicate the year of composition) named the "Letzte" or "Last" symphony. Brian Newbould believes that the "Last" symphony refers to a sketch in D major (D 936A), identified by Ernst Hilmar in 1977, and which was realised by Newbould as the Tenth Symphony. The fragment was bound with other symphony fragments (D 615 and D 708A).
In conclusion, the resulting and most current order followed by the English-speaking world is:
No. 7: E major, D 729
No. 8: B minor, D 759 Unfinished
No. 9: C major, D 944 Great C major
No. 10: D major, D 936A
Completions
D 708A, D 729, D 759, and D 936A have been completed by Schubert scholar Brian Newbould. D 729 has additionally been completed by John Francis Barnett and Felix Weingartner. Brian Newbould additionally orchestrated the existing sketches for D 615.

The Turi and Bangash tribes staged a sit-in protest near Shaheed Park for eight days following two explosions in Parachinar. The sit-in began after the two bombs went off on 23 June 2017 Friday evening, as shoppers were out buying supplies in preparation for the breaking of the fast on one of the last days of the holy month of Ramadan.This incident followed the callous sectarian terror attack in Parachinar. The Parachinar's sit-in was named as Sadae Mazlomeen Dharna (Voice of Victims Sit-in)
The relatives and people of Parachinar have put forth the demand that Chief of Army Staff, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar and other high-level officials should visit the area. The protesters had been holding a peaceful demonstration following twin blasts, the latest in a series of bloody attacks that have targeted Shia Muslims in Parachinar the Kurram tribal area. Earlier, following last week's attacks, the protesters had come under fire from the government's security forces, in an attempt to force them to disperse. Reports indicate that several were killed in that firing.
Thousands of protesters in the northwestern Pakistani city of Parachinar have ended a week-long sit-in following twin blasts that killed at least 100 people, after the military acceded to their demands for better security, according to protest leaders and the military.
Reason behind sit-in
The demonstrators had demanded that the commandant of the paramilitary regiment responsible for firing on the protesters be dismissed, and that a new security plan be enforced for the district with input from local leaders.
Protest leaders also demanded that local tribesmen be inducted into the paramilitary forces that secure the district, and that a local militia be officially recognised in the new security plan. Greater compensation for the families of those killed was also demanded, equivalent to that announced for people killed in a devastating oil tanker fire in central Pakistan last week.
The paramilitary Frontier Corps policy in Parachinar is clearly discriminatory," reads the list of demands. "Instead of providing protection to the people they are involved in murdering them. As a result, the return of the Kurram (Turi) militia be guaranteed and Parachinar's security be immediately handed over to them.
Those demands related to security, the army chief has immediately given the order for them to implement. And you would see the additional army troops that have arrived," Major-General Asif Ghafoor, the military's spokesman, told reporters on Friday.
The tribal leaders said that unlike the other areas, the injured were given only Rs 0.1 million rupees while the relatives of those martyred are given only Rs0.3 million. Protesting tribal elders have rejected the compensation offered by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to the families of Parachinar bombing victims, saying that they needed to be recognised as human beings first. Until the approval of demands, the protest would continue, added the protesting members of the community.
Mehdi Hussain Turi said, a local government employee. Children and young men are standing out there around the protesters for security, through the heat, through the rain, through everything."
For Shafiq Ahmed Turi, the protest was a last resort, to get the government to pay attention to the needs of Parachinar's citizens.
"We live peacefully, we bury our dead every time. But this time we were forced to come out to the road, just so that the government and the army chief would listen to us."
Negotiation with Army chief
COAS General Qamar Javed Bajwa visited Parachinar, Kurram Agency on Friday 30 June 2017 after the two blasts on Friday 23 June 2017. On the occasion, he was briefed about the security situation in the area, according to a statement issued by Pakistan Army's public affairs department. The Army chief also held a meeting tribal elders and the heirs of those killed in Parachinar blasts.
The locals and tribal leaders expressed full confidence and trust in Pakistan Army and its leadership, saying, "We, the people of Parachinar stand behind Pakistan Army, We are Pakistanis and Muslims only. Our blood is for Pakistan."
COAS also met representatives of sit-in and listened to their concerns. After meeting with the Army Chief, the following demands were approved.
Victims will get compensation equivalent to compensation given in Punjab. Family members of relatives will be given government jobs.
Army Public School Parachinar is named after Maj Gulfam Shaheed and it will be upgraded to Cadet College in due course.
Agency headquarter hospital Parachinar will be upgraded to "A" Category, however, the CoAS has decline request for CMH because Parachinar is a border area.
Colonel Umar removed from his post.
Firing by FC troops while handling mob situation post blast is being inquired and those responsible shall not be spared. FC commandant has already been changed. Notwithstanding the irreparable loss, four Shaheeds and injured due to firing have been given separate compensation by FC.
While there are clear evidences of hostile foreign hands in recent incidents, local facilitators and abettors have been apprehended who will be tried in military courts.
Additional Army troops have been moved in Parachinar to enhance its security while FC troops are being beefed up on Pak-Afg border to seal it effectively. Toori Razakars are also being dovetailed on check posts.
Safe city project for Parachinar by installing CCTV cameras in line with the ones in Lahore and Islamabad will be undertaken.
Fencing of border is already in progress. More sensitive areas of FATA are being fenced in Phase 1 while complete Pak-Afg border including in Baluchistan will be fenced in Phase 2.
Trauma Centre will be established at Parachinar by Army while local civil hospital will be upgraded for better medical care by civil administration.
Army fully supports mainstreaming of FATA which is being pursued and its early implementation is essential for enduring peace and stability.
Govt. has now announced compensation for Parachinar victims at par with other such victims elsewhere in the country. All Pakistani's are equal.
Solidarity
Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen's leaders and Secretary General Allama Raja Nasir Abbas,Shia Ulema Council leaders and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan have visited Parachinar to express his grief and solidarity with the families of victims of twin bombings on June 23, 2017. While PPP leaders Rehman Malik, Faisal Karim Kundi and media journalists, claimed that their helicopter was not allowed to land in Parachinar city.
Civil activists Jibran Nasir, Talha Rehman, Mahim Maher, Meena Gabeena, JDC Secretary General Syed Zafar Abbas and Saad Edhi (Grandson of Edhi) came from Karachi to join Parachinar sit-in. Shia Ulema from Sindh, Hangu, Kohat, Peshawar and Quetta visited Parachinar to express solidarity with families of victims and join Sadae Mazlomeen Dharna. Christian community also joins sit-in protest for solidarity with victims of twin bomb blasts.

Modern Art is the eleventh studio album by alternative rock musician Matthew Sweet. It was released on Missing Piece in 2011.
Release
The album, available as a CD, 2-LP vinyl set, and digital download, was met with little commercial success, but with favorable reviews. Amazon.com wrote, "Defiantly unorthodox, but often playfully so, Modern Art features 12 new compositions of Sweet's trademark wistful, yearning pop that recall some of Sweet s touchstones: the Beatles, Beach Boys and Big Star", and even notes the work of Sweet's side-players: "Longtime musical cohort Ric Menck (Velvet Crush) does all the drumming on the album (except for "Ivory Tower", which is built on a random drum pattern supplied by Sweet's friend, actor/musician Fred Armisen). Dennis Taylor's deft and urgent guitar lines serve as a running commentary to Sweet's introspective singing. Finished by mastering engineer Glenn Schick, Modern Art promises to be another trend-setting release by Sweet."

Doom RPG is a mobile phone game developed by Fountainhead Entertainment and published by JAMDAT Mobile. It combines the Doom first-person shooter franchise with role-playing video game elements. The storyline incorporates many similar events of Doom 3, but involves different characters than those in the third game.
The website for Doom RPG states that the protagonist in Doom RPG is the same character from Doom, Doom II, and Doom 3.
Gameplay
The game retains many of the elements of Doom, and is shown in the first person like the original. It is also visually similar to the original Doom. However, the game is fundamentally different in that it is a turn-based role-playing game, rather than a shooter, with greater emphasis on the plot. Combat and movement are turn-based, allowing the player time to select their responses in combat. The player turns at 90 degree angles and moves space by space. It is very important to speak to the scientists and access computer terminals to attain vital information in order to progress through the game, similar to Doom 3.
Many features of the original are retained, including the status bar face, sound effects and the majority of the weapons and monsters. Notably absent are the Chainsaw, Arachnotrons and Spider Mastermind. A difference from the original is that each monster is one of three levels of difficulty, and is colored to indicate this.
The game also adds several new elements. New weapons include the fire axe and fire extinguisher which are useful in combat against certain enemies. The dogs from Wolfenstein 3D appear as a new enemy, known as Hellhounds. A dog collar-styled mind-control device allows the hellhounds to be captured as pets, which can then act as both a melee weapon and a shield.
Plot
The story occurs on a Martian Union Aerospace Corporation installation similar to Doom 3. The player is addressed to by NPCs in the game as Marine.
The game is divided into section based on Sectors in the base. The sectors are Entrance, Junction, Sector 1 through Sector 7, and Reactor. The Junction is the staging area or main town for the game.
Guerard was not on good terms with Jensen. Three weeks prior to the start of the game, Guerard asked Graff to perform a security audit on Jensen. Jensen failed the security audit and was dismissed for this security breach. Jensen suspected that Guerard was involved in his dismissal. During the same time, demons started to invade the installation, appearing out of nowhere. It is around this time that the game begins.
Early on in the game, the Marine meets Dr. Jensen when he was accessing a computer terminal investigating his dismissal. During the exploration of first few sectors of the installation, the Marine receives help from Dr. Guerard in gaining access to various locked down areas. In Biological Research Facility, the Marine meets Dr. Nadira who quarantines his weapons claiming security measures. Dr. Nadira then commands his mind-controlled hellhounds to attack the Marine and disappears in the process. Eventually, Marine meets Jensen again. This time he is incarcerated in a prison cell. After freeing Jensen, he informs the Marine that Guerard and Nadira are into an evil scheme and directs the Marine to the next section of the installation.
The next time the Marine meets Guerard and Nadira, it is known that Guerard was behind the invasion and has been attempting to open a portal to Hell in the Reactor Sector. Guerard promptly orders demons to attack the Marine and Nadira. Nadira dies and Guerard escapes. The Marine proceeds through the remaining two sectors, acquiring the BFG 9000 and the key to the Reactor sector. By then, a major invasion devastates the Junction. With the help of Kelvin and Jensen, the Marine gains access to the Reactor sector. Kelvin and Jensen both die in the process.
In the Reactor sector, Guerard reveals himself as Kronos and transforms into demonic form. By this time, he has succeeded in opening the portal to Hell. After defeating Kronos, the Marine closes the portal by destroying the reactors powering it. The Cyberdemon slips through before the portal closes. The game ends with the defeat of the Cyberdemon. The Cyberdemon is likely to be Kronos' creation referred to by other NPCs.
Development
The game's engine was later used for another Fountainhead Entertainment title, Orcs & Elves, Orcs & Elves II, and was also followed by Wolfenstein RPG and Doom II RPG.
Supported platforms
The game was released for three platforms:
Java
Low-end BREW
High-end BREW
Symbian OS never received a dedicated port of game.
A fan version was released for PC.
Reception
The game received some awards including "2005 Mobile Game of the Year", "2005 Adventure/RPG of the Year", "Editor's Award", "Game of the Year", "Editor's Choice Award" and "Best Wireless Adventure Game". GameSpot gave Doom RPG a score of 8.6 out of a possible 10 in their review of the game.

Typhoon Gay, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Seniang, was the strongest and longest-lasting storm of the 1992 Pacific typhoon season and most intense globally in 1992. It formed on November 14 near the International Date Line from a monsoon trough, which also spawned two other systems. Typhoon Gay later moved through the Marshall Islands as an intensifying typhoon, and after passing through the country it reached its peak intensity over open waters. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak winds of 295 km/h (185 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of . However, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), which is the official warning center in the western Pacific, estimated winds of 205 km/h (125 mph), with a pressure of . Gay weakened rapidly after peaking because of interaction with another typhoon, and it struck Guam with winds of 160 km/h (100 mph) on November 23. The typhoon briefly re-intensified before weakening and becoming extratropical south of Japan on November 30.
The typhoon first affected the Marshall Islands, where 5,000 people became homeless and heavy crop damage was reported. The nation's capital of Majuro experienced power and water outages during the storm. There were no fatalities among Marshall Islands citizens, although the typhoon killed a sailor traveling around the world. When Gay struck Guam, it became the sixth typhoon of the year to affect the island. Most of the weaker structures had been destroyed during Typhoon Omar earlier in the year, resulting in little additional damage from Gay. Because of its substantial weakening, the typhoon had a disrupted inner-core and produced minimal rainfall. However, strong winds scorched the plants on Guam with saltwater, causing extensive defoliation. Further north, high waves from the typhoon destroyed a house on Saipan, and heavy rainfall in Okinawa, Japan, caused flooding and power outages.
Meteorological history
The origins of Typhoon Gay were from a tropical disturbance east of the International Date Line along a monsoon trough that extended west to the South China Sea in mid-November 1992. The same trough had earlier spawned Tropical Storm Forrest and would later create Typhoon Hunt. The tropical disturbance moved westward across the dateline and gradually became better organized with increased convection. On November 14, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. At 1800 UTC that day, the agency initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 31W, located to the east of the Marshall Islands. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) also assessed that the depression had developed by that time. The next day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Gay.
For most Typhoon Gay's existence, a strong anticyclone to its north steered the storm to the west or west-northwest. The JTWC upgraded the storm to typhoon status early on November 17, and the JMA followed suit the next day. Gay first affected Mejit Island and eventually crossed the central portion of the Marshall Islands. Owing to favorable sea surface temperatures and upper-level wind patterns, the storm entered a phase of rapid deepening similar to other November typhoons near that location. On November 19, the JTWC upgraded Gay to a super typhoon, which is a typhoon with 1-minute sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph). Gradual intensification ensued, and based on satellite estimates, the JTWC estimated that Typhoon Gay attained peak winds of 295 km/h (185 mph) at 0000 UTC on November 21. The agency also estimated that the typhoon reached a minimum barometric pressure of , which would have made Gay the most intense typhoon since Typhoon Tip in 1979, tying with Hurricane Patricia in 2015 for the second-strongest tropical cyclone worldwide. At the same time, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph), with a pressure of .
After Gay attained its peak intensity, outflow from Typhoon Hunt to its northwest increased the wind shear over the typhoon. The wind shear deteriorated Gay's northern eyewall, causing the typhoon to weaken. In the 24 hours after Gay reached its peak intensity, the JTWC estimated that the winds had decreased by 65 km/h (40 mph) to below super typhoon status; such rapid weakening is uncommon for a storm over open waters. Tropical cyclone forecast models had anticipated Gay to make a turn to the north and northeast, but it maintained a west-northwest track toward Guam. Despite weakening steadily, the typhoon maintained a large size with a wind diameter of . Around 0000 UTC on November 23, Gay made landfall on Guam, becoming the third typhoon in three months to strike the island—the others were Typhoon Omar in August and Typhoon Brian in October. Both the JTWC and the JMA estimated the typhoon to have had winds of 160 km/h (100 mph) at landfall. The influence from Typhoon Hunt diminished after Gay affected Guam, allowing it to begin restrengthening. Late on November 25, the JTWC estimated that the typhoon attained a secondary peak intensity of 215 km/h (135 mph). Gay subsequently slowed while moving along the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, and it turned north while gradually weakening. On November 28, the JMA downgraded Gay to a tropical storm, and the JTWC followed suit the next day. The JMA assessed that Gay became an extratropical cyclone at 0000 UTC on November 30; however, the JTWC continued issuing advisories until December 1, making it the longest-lasting typhoon of the season with 63 advisories. The remnant of Gay accelerated and turned to the northeast, passing to the southeast of Japan and crossing the International Date Line.
Preparations and impact
Marshall Islands
Typhoon Gay first affected the Marshall Islands, striking several atolls in the archipelago with typhoon-force winds. On Mejit Island, the first island to be affected, the typhoon destroyed every wooden structure and left most of the islanders homeless. High winds downed all of the island's trees and destroyed 75% of the crops. Nearby, Ailuk Atoll experienced similar winds, though house damage was minor despite similar crop losses. The large wind field extended to the south, affecting Maloelap and Aur atolls with winds that damaged 30% of the houses and crops. Further south, the Marshall Islands capital city of Majuro experienced lightning strikes from the typhoon, which caused an island-wide power outage and cuts to the water supply and radio communication. Debris from the storm closed the Marshall Islands International Airport for two days. On Ujae Atoll, the typhoon destroyed an automated meteorological observing station that had been installed in 1989. The typhoon left over 5,000 people homeless across the country, but there were no native deaths and only one injury in the archipelago owing to well-executed warnings and preparations. However, large waves from the typhoon sank a boat in a small lagoon, killing one of the boat's two sailors.
Guam and Northern Marianas
After affecting the Marshall Islands, Gay tracked toward Guam and became the fifth typhoon to come within of the island in six months. Extensive preparations were made, including the sending of ships to mitigate damage and flying United States Air Force planes to other bases in the region. The schools, government buildings, airport, and port were closed, and about 4,300 people evacuated to storm shelters. Further north, 1,639 people evacuated to storm shelters on Saipan, which set the record for the most storm evacuees at the time.
Despite weakening greatly from its peak intensity, Gay struck Guam with sustained winds of 160 km/h (100 mph), with gusts to 195 km/h (120 mph) on Nimitz Hill. The winds were strong enough to disrupt power and water utilities, as well as destroy a few houses. As a result of its weakening, Gay had a disrupted inner-core with little precipitation, which prompted the JTWC to label it as a "dry typhoon"; rainfall totals on the island ranged from only 40–90 mm (1.5–3.5 in). Despite the extreme winds, little wind-thrown trees or snapped branches were observed. The combination of the winds and light rainfall, however, sprayed saltwater over the island's vegetation, leading to near island-wide loss of leaves. Majority of the local dicots withered and lost their leaves within two days after the storm, while other plants such as palms, cycads and gymnosperms retained their foliage but turned brown. The defoliation led to significant losses for crop farmers; in some locations, the crops did not recover for four years. Along the east coast of Guam, Gay produced a storm surge of 1.2–1.8 m (4–6 ft). The surge reached 3.4 m (11 ft) on Cabras Island in northern Guam, washing sand and water onto coastal roads and breaking a boat from its moorings. The JTWC estimated that damage would have been worse had Typhoon Omar not destroyed the weaker structures three months earlier; little additional damage occurred to the island's capital of Hagåtña. The typhoon destroyed four iron roofs on Tinian Island, located north of Guam. On Saipan to its north, the storm surge destroyed one house and threatened the foundation of several others; twelve families required rescue by emergency workers. The storm caused power outages, and one house sustained fire damage due to candles and kerosene lamps.

While Gay was becoming extratropical, Okinawa Prefecture experienced heavy rainfall. The highest total was , and one station recorded in a ten-minute period. The rains flooded four buildings and inundated crop fields. Rough winds with gusts peaking at caused isolated power outages and the cancellation of two airline flights.
Aftermath
Marshall Islands president Amata Kabua declared nine islands as disaster areas. United States president George H. W. Bush also declared the Marshall Islands a disaster area on December 16. Despite being an independent nation, the Marshall Islands were eligible to the same funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency as a U.S. state or territory. The United States provided a loan of $508,245 (1994 USD) for emergency assistance and to train locals to mitigate future events. After the storm, workers near Majuro planted seeds to regrow the damaged crops.
The rapid succession of typhoons in 1992 caused a significant drop in tourism in Guam. During typhoons Omar and Gay, there was little communication between residents on the island. As a result, the Guam Communications Network was created to facilitate future relief efforts during storms.
A research paper published ten years after the storm suggested that Gay could have been stronger than Typhoon Tip, which attained the lowest barometric pressure ever recorded. While at its peak intensity, Gay registered a rating of 8.0 for nine consecutive hours using the Dvorak technique, indicating sustained wind speeds of at least (315 km/h) 195 mph. In addition, the cyclone had a significantly colder band of clouds around the eye. Typhoon Angela in 1995 presented similar features and could have been stronger than Gay. Neither of the two had direct observations into their eyes, however, making it impossible to confirm such intensity.

"Cherish" is a song by American R&B band Kool & the Gang, released in April 1985. It was the third single released from the band's sixteenth studio album, Emergency. It was certified Gold by the RIAA and held the number 1 position on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart for six weeks running. It would ultimately rank as the biggest Adult Contemporary chart hit of the 1980s.
The song is a romantic ballad that proved to be extremely popular when it was released and has since been a wedding song staple of sorts.
The song was composed in the key of B minor, though the chorus shifts to D major (the relative major of B minor).
Different mixes
There are several different mixes of "Cherish". The original album version (length: 4:47) begins with the sound of a wave crashing on the beach followed by a (solely) keyboard intro. The entire first verse is sung without drums and percussion, which do not begin until the first chorus.
The single (and video) version of "Cherish" (length: 3:58) adds additional "beach" effects at the beginning and combines an acoustic guitar with the original keyboard introduction. Additional drumming, which this time starts immediately after J.T. Taylor begins singing the first verse, is also added throughout the song. Whereas the chorus is repeated (sung twice) after the first verse in the album version, it is only sung one time on the single; several bars of music are also cut from the outro.
There is also an extended 12-inch version of "Cherish" (length: 5:43) which includes the same flourishes that were added to the single/video version of the tune, plus saxophone parts during various sections of the song (introduction, bridge, etc.), including a whole additional sax interlude after the first chorus.
Furthermore, there is an edited mix of this 12-inch version (length: 4:22), where the bridge that appears in all of the other versions of the song is replaced by the same saxophone interlude that is included in the full 12-inch version.
Chart performance
"Cherish" peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in September 1985, remaining in the runner-up position for three weeks, behind "Money for Nothing" by Dire Straits. It was a number-one hit on both the R&B and adult contemporary charts in the US, spending one week atop the R&B chart and six weeks atop the AC chart. In the UK, the song reached number four on the UK Singles Chart and remained there for three weeks.

Chen Gui (; born October 1956) is a former Chinese politician who spent most of his career in North China's Hebei province. As of March 2015 he was under investigation by the Communist Party's anti-corruption agency. Previously he served as the Communist Party Secretary of Hengshui.
Life and career
Chen was born and raised in Zhuolu County, Hebei. He graduated from Hebei Normal University in 1981, majoring in Chinese language.
He was appointed to the vice-county governor and deputy Communist Party secretary of Huaian County in February 1993, and Communist Party secretary, the top political position in the city, from February 1996 to December 1997.
Chen was vice-mayor of Zhangjiakou in December 1997, and deputy Communist Party secretary, in February 2003. In June 2006 he was transferred to Qinhuangdao as the deputy Communist Party secretary, a position he held until March 2008.
In November 2008 he was promoted to become the Communist Party Secretary of Hengshui. However, he was dismissed for "disciplinary violations" in April 2010, for reasons that were never made public. He then left public view.
Downfall
Chen was placed under investigation by the authorities in March 2015, again for unknown reasons. He was the second Hebei official to be announced to be under investigation since an anti-corruption campaign began following the 18th Party Congress. It is notable that his predecessor as Hengshui party chief Jing Chunhua was also investigated for corruption.
In January 2016, he was expelled from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and dismissed from public office.

The Blanchard River is a tributary of the Auglaize River in northwestern Ohio in the United States. It drains a primarily rural farming area in the watershed of Lake Erie.
It rises in central Hardin County, on the northern outskirts of Kenton. It flows generally north for its first into eastern Hancock County, where it turns sharply to the west. It flows west through Findlay and past Ottawa. It joins the Auglaize from the east in western Putnam County approximately north of Cloverdale at .
History
The river is named for Jean Jacques Blanchard (1720-1802), a French tailor who settled among the Shawnee along the river in 1769. Fort Findlay, an American outpost in the War of 1812, was constructed along the river in 1812 at the site of the present-day city of Findlay.
In 1908, Tell Taylor wrote "Down by the Old Mill Stream", a popular song of the early 20th Century and a barbershop favorite, while sitting on the banks of the Blanchard River.
Around 1939 numerous projects by the Works Progress Administration improved the river near Findlay, including construction of two major bridges, clearing substantial existing pollution, and building a sewage treatment plant to reduce ongoing pollution.
Flooding
In August 2007 flooding along the Blanchard River caused more than $100 million in damage in Findlay and an estimated $12 million in damage in Ottawa. Flooding in Ottawa is aggravated by the low bridge carrying County Road I-9 in Putnam County. It traps debris, forming a dam during floods. Flooding also caused damage in Findlay in March 2011.
On November 28, 2012, officials from Hancock and Putnam counties traveled to Washington D.C. to lobby for $1.7 million in federal funding to complete phase three of the Blanchard River Flood Mitigation study.

Hendersin Knob () is an ice-covered knob rising between the heads of Craft Glacier and Rochray Glacier in the southwest part of Thurston Island, Antarctica. It was first plotted from air photos taken by U.S. Navy Operation HIGHJUMP, 1946–47, and was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for aviation radioman Wendell K. Hendersin, U.S. Navy, a member of the expedition who lost his life in a seaplane crash at Thurston Island on December 30, 1946.

The Bikaner State Railway (BSR) was formed in 1924 and took over responsibility for working the Bikaner section of the Jodhpur–Bikaner Railway.
History
Earlier named the Jodhpur Railway the first section opened as a metre gauge line in 1882, later becoming the Jodhpur–Bikaner Railway (JBR) in 1889. In 1908 the JBR operated 828 miles (1325 km) in the territories of Sind (under British control) and in territories of the States of Jodhpur and Bikaner. By 1918 the ‘JBR System' had expanded to 1355 miles (2180 km), which comprised 1106 miles (1179 km) plus a further 249 miles (401 km) which JBR was working and operating under agreements with other railways. A further 210 miles (400 km) were sanctioned or under construction by JBR in 1918.
In 1924, the JBR was divided into its two constituent parts, with two new systems, the Jodhpur State Railway (JSR) and Bikaner State Railway (BSR) formed to take over responsibility for working the railway. The exact mileage of BSR comprising the "Bikaner Section" of JBR is not known but in 1918 it was 630 miles (1013 km). In 1936-37 the route mileage for the BSR had expanded to 796 miles(1281 km) of metre gauge lines. By 1943 the BSR was operating a network of 883 miles (1421 km)
In 1947, the British section of the Jodhpur-Hyderabad Railway and the western portions of Jodhpur State Railway and Bikaner State Railway was ceded to the government of Pakistan becoming part of Pakistan Railways. The remaining portions of the Jodhpur State Railway and Bikaner State Railway became part of the Northern Division of Indian Railways in 1952.
Conversion to broad gauge
The network was converted to broad gauge progressively in the 2000s and 2010s.

The Boy's Doin' It is the seventeenth studio album by South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela. It was recorded in New York City and in Lagos, Nigeria, and released in June 1975 via Casablanca Records label. The album was re-released on CD in 1998 on Verve Records with six additional tracks.
Reception
John Bush of Allmusic noted: "Recorded in Lagos, Nigeria and dedicated to Fela Kuti, The Boy's Doin' It has six extended jams, each of which does an excellent job of playing off deep grooves against ensemble vocals and catchy hooks, with plenty of room for Masekela's own trumpet and every note polished to a fine '70s sheen. It didn't matter what type of music fan you were: pop, disco, funk, world music, and any but the most hidebound jazz purist could get into these tracks."

Kazakhstan joined the World Bank in 1992 after it had gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Kazakhstan has one of the fastest growing economies of all Post-Soviet states, and as a result had its classification changed from a lower-middle income state to and upper-middle income state in 2006. Because of this, Kazakhstan has begun to rely less on international financing as it had in previous decades; however, Kazakhstan still takes out loans from the world bank, primarily relating to the countries environmental issues.
History
Upon leaving the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan showed impressive growth due to its governments willingness to accept Market liberalization and widespread banking reforms. Spearheaded by its booming oil industry, Kazakhstan was able to produce 60% of the GDP of Central Asia while it experienced an average of 10% growth rates from 1996 through 2006. The rapid growth in the economy has meant that World Bank efforts in Kazakhstan have been primarily focused on fixing issues related to the countries dire environmental issues. Specifically, early World Bank efforts had focused around replenishing the dried Aral Sea which had been reduced to nearly 10% of its original size since Soviet irrigation projects had begun in the area in the 1960s. It is in the view of the World Bank that efforts to bring water back to the North Aral Sea have largely been successful thanks to the construction of the Kok-Aral Dam which raised the water levels by 4m. Along with projects to restore the Aral Sea, early on in Kazakhstan's reemergence post-Soviet Union, the World Bank also invested in infrastructure projects. World Bank investments in infrastructure in Kazakhstan were primarily loans given to supplement ongoing projects such as the construction of an electricity grid and thousands of Kilometers of planned roads.
Current World Bank Loan Efforts
IBRD
Currently the branch of the World Bank which provides the most funds to Kazakhstan is the IBRD. The IBRD has had 48 projects in Kazakhstan and has committed more than 8 billion USD to infrastructure, developmental, and environmental projects. The most recent major project that has been funded by the IBRD was a 1 billion dollar loan given for programmatic development policy financing. The goal of this major project, contradictory to the World Banks primary goal of environmental reform in Kazakhstan, is to help Kazakhstan reorient its economy so that it is less reliant on the Oil Industry. The loan, which was approved in 2015, is currently being repaid by Kazakhstan.
IFC
The International Finance Corporation has also had major involvement in Kazakhstan's development efforts. It has directly invested in 26 projects worth over 1 billion dollars, and has been an adviser on 5 projects totaling nearly 10 million dollars. Most recent investment from the IFC have been to financial institutions with the goal of providing support for small enterprise in remote parts of Kazakhstan. Some recent projects have also targeted Agribusiness, in order to increase the countries food production and decrease its reliance on foreign imports.
MIGA
MIGA has also given two loans to Kazakhstan, although MIGA does not participate much in the growth of Kazakhstan as its focus is primarily on lower-income developing countries. MIGA's only involvement in Kazakhstan was two loans of 190 million dollars given to the ATF Bank in Kazakhstan in the effort to alleviate stresses from the Global financial crisis. Both of these loans aimed to allow the ATF Bank to diversify its portfolio to include more small and medium enterprises.
Reception
Overall trends for the economy in Kazakhstan indicate that World Bank efforts to help the development of Kazakhstan have been a net positive for the country. This is reflected in the rising life expectancy and decreasing poverty ratio of the country. However, evidence suggests that the World Bank has failed to effectively tackle one of its main goals in Kazakhstan, protecting the environment. Although efforts to revitalize the Aral Sea have largely been successful, Carbon dioxide emission in the country have rapidly increased since the year 2000.

The Klaarkampstermeermolen or Klaarkampstermolen is a polder windmill in Rinsumageast, Friesland, the Netherlands. Built in 1862 the smock mill was relocated to its current position in 1893 and has been restored several times. Worked by volunteers it still drains the Klaarkampstermeer as of 2022. The mill is listed as a Rijksmonument since 1970 and can be visited by appointment.
History
De Klaarkampstermeermolen was originally built in 1862 at the Juckemavaart canal. It was moved to its current site in 1893 to drain the Klaarkampstermeer. The mill was restored in 1975 and an electric pump was installed. During a further restoration in 1991 the wooden windshaft was replaced by a cast iron one, cast by Gieterij Hardinxveld of Hardinxveld-Giessendam, South Holland. A further restoration was undertaken in 2009. The mill is listed as a Rijksmonument, №11695.
Description
De Klaarkampstermeermolen is a grondzeiler, the mill can be set to the wind from the ground: as the sails almost touch the ground no stage is needed. It is a two-storey smock mill on a single-storey brick base. The mill is set to the wind by tailpole and winch. The smock and cap are thatched. The common sailssit on wings with a span.
The windshaft carries the 47 cogs brake wheel that drives the wallower (24 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft that has two crown wheels at the bottom end called the upper and the lower crown wheel. The upper crown wheel has 35 cogs and drives an Archimedes' screw. The lower crown wheel, which has 34 cogs is carried on the axle of an Archimedes' screw that drains the Klaarkampstermeer polder. The axle of the screw is diameter and long. The diameter screw is inclined at 25.7° and each revolution lifts of water.
Visiting
As per 2020 the Klaarkampstermeermolen was open to the public by appointment and on the first Saturday morning of each month.

The See Clearly Method was an eye-exercise program that was marketed as an alternative to the use of glasses, contact lenses, and eye surgery to improve vision. Sales were halted by legal action in 2006. The method is not supported by basic science, and no research studies were conducted prior to marketing. The program is based in part on the Bates method, an alternative therapy devised in the early 20th century, which lacks clinical evidence to support the claim that it can improve eyesight.
History
The See Clearly Method was created by four individuals who called themselves the "American Vision Institute": optometrist David W. Muris, optometrist Merrill J. Allen, psychologist Francis A. Young, and nuclear chemist Steven Beresford. In 1996, they authored a book titled Improve Your Vision Without Glasses or Contact Lenses: A New Program of Therapeutic Eye Exercises, on which the later system was based. When Fairfield, Iowa, businessman Cliff Rose saw the book, he asked that the authors develop the program. Along with attorney David Sykes, Rose created Vision Improvement Technologies, which owned and marketed the See Clearly Method, which was heavily advertised on radio and television from 2001 to 2006, with the endorsement of actress Mariette Hartley.
The See Clearly Method has been described as "amply critiqued and debunked."
Both the Journal of the American Optometric Association and the Journal of Behavioral Optometry declined to publish a study by the American Vision Institute purportedly demonstrating the efficacy of the method. The AVI then self-published the paper on their website.
Techniques
Some of the program's techniques were adapted from the Bates method, a collection of techniques developed by William Bates in the early 20th century. These techniques were based on Bates' own unorthodox theories, which have been consistently rejected by the scientific and medical community. Still, no evidence suggests that the Bates method, in whole or in part, is effective.
Some of the See Clearly Method's techniques are:
"Tromboning" involved holding a small object at varying distances from one's eyes, inhaling as it was moved in and exhaling as it was moved out. The program's manual stated, "Tromboning exercises the focusing mechanism, improves control of the extraocular muscles, and stimulates the flow of nutrients inside the eyes".
The Scanning Chart exercise involved moving a chart just out of focus, then jumping from dot to dot in time with the music on the program's exercise video.
The program recommended Acupressure, in essence a massage for muscles surrounding the eye.
"Blur reading" entailed turning a magazine upside-down at a distance from which the words were unclear, selecting a word and running one's gaze around it, and then around any letters one could recognize.
Personal affirmations such as "I am seeing better each day" or "I can see without my glasses" were suggested.
Light therapy, a variation of Bates's "sunning", involved sitting with one's eyes closed and the face six inches from an unshaded 150-watt bulb, just far enough to make the eyes "pleasantly warm but not too hot", according to the manual.
"Palming", another technique adapted from Bates, involved closing the eyes and resting them against the palms.
"Hydrotherapy", involved alternately placing hot and cold water-soaked towels over the eyes.
Legal action
Iowa State Attorney General Tom Miller filed a consumer fraud lawsuit against Vision Improvement Technologies, the promoter of the See Clearly Method, in 2005. The lawsuit alleged that "Vision Improvement Technologies uses a combination of misleading and unfair marketing tactics to sell their kits, including exaggerated claims of effectiveness, false implications of scientific validity, and misleading consumer testimonials in advertising." In February 2006 an Iowa court issued a temporary injunction restricting certain aspects of the company's marketing. A November 2, 2006, press release from the Iowa Attorney General's office announced a consent decree with Vision Improvement under which the company will halt sales, offer restitution to customers, clear customers' credit records of any filings related to See Clearly purchases, and halt operations as of December 2006.
On December 18, 2006, the company's web site stated, "As of November 1, 2006 The See Clearly Method is no longer available for sale." In response to a 2007 complaint by the California Attorney General's office concerning David Muris' involvement with the See Clearly Method, Muris was placed on probation for five years in 2008 by the state Board of Optometry.

Offending religious feelings () is a blasphemy law in Poland. According to Article 196 of the Penal Code: "Whoever offends the religious feelings of other persons by publicly insulting an object of religious worship, or a place designated for public religious ceremonies, is liable to pay a fine, have their liberty limited, or be deprived of their liberty for a period of up to two years."
Constitutionality
A law forbidding blasphemy was included in the original 1932 Polish penal code.
The Constitutional Tribunal has ruled that the law is not in conflict with the Constitution of Poland and is not overbroad. The European Court of Human Rights has also allowed other blasphemy laws under margin of appreciation doctrine, as individual countries have broad ability to set moral standards.
Polish law has no provision which exempts or reduces the scrutiny applied to artistic expression alleged to violate the law, although many artists who have been accused of violating it say that their work should be protected as artistic freedom.
A separate law, Article 256, criminalizes incitement to hatred based on religious belief.
Cases
The majority of cases in which charges of Article 196 are made do not lead to actual convictions. About 55 prosecutions on average were brought each year between 1999 and 2016. Since Poland is a predominantly Catholic country (around 87% of Poles say they were baptized as Catholics), most Article 196 cases concern that religion.
In 2000, Polish artist Dorota Nieznalska juxtaposed Greek cross with male genitalia in an artistic exhibition. In 2009 she was finally acquitted after lengthy legal proceedings, due to the court not finding an intent to offend religious feelings.
In 2008, musician Adam Darski tore up a Bible during a performance, referring to it as "the book of lies". He was acquitted after the performance was deemed not to be sufficiently public, the audience had bought tickets and consented to the performance, and only one audience member complained. After his acquittal, Darski announced his intention to hold "Satanist communion" during performances.
In 2009, singer Dorota Rabczewska (Doda) referred to the Bible as "something written by individuals high on alcohol and weed". She was convicted and fined. The case Rabczewska v. Poland is currently pending before the European Court of Human Rights.
In 2015, Robert Biedroń, mayor of Słupsk, was investigated for removing a portrait of John Paul II from his office after PiS activists reported him for allegedly offending religious feelings.
In 2019, Elżbieta Podleśna was arrested for displaying a Rainbow Madonna adaptation of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa. In July 2020, Podleśna and two other activists were formally charged with offending religious feelings; they pled not guilty. Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights and Amnesty International criticized the use of the law.
In October 2019, Bishop Szymon Niemiec of the United Ecumenical Church was interrogated by police under suspicion of offending religious feelings "by insulting the object of worship in the form of a Roman Catholic Mass"; police had received more than 150 complaints regarding the incident. He had held an ecumenical, LGBT-inclusive religious service in connection with Warsaw's 2019 Equality Parade, which was criticized by the Roman Catholic Episcopal Conference of Poland and Law and Justice politicians. Niemiec previously held similar services every year since 2010 without controversy. Niemiec and Julia Maciocha, president of the committee which organizes Equality Parade, stated that the complaint against Niemiec violates the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion.
Calls to toughen the law
In 2022 United Poland called for tougher blasphemy laws in Poland, such as three-year jail terms for insulting church or interrupting mass.
Repeal attempts
The law is controversial in Poland. Lawyers have noted that it is excessively vague, not stating what actions count as "offending religious feelings", leading some to call for repeal of the law. Opponents of the law say that it has a chilling effect on legitimate free speech and criticism of religion. It has been criticized for violating free speech by human rights watchdogs such as Article 19, Human Rights Watch, Freedom House, End Blasphemy Laws, and Amnesty International. The Council of Europe's Recommendation 1805 urges member states to repeal blasphemy laws. Anne Ramberg and Michael Kirby of the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute stated that the law was overbroad, conflicting with Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and was used unfairly to target LGBT rights advocates.
In 2019, MP of Modern submitted legislation that would have abolished the offense. Referencing Podleśna's arrest, he said that Article 196 "has become a political tool today" and was an "oppressive article that has repeatedly limited creative freedom". Robert Biedroń, leader of Spring, said that his party aims to repeal the offense if elected. Biedroń added that the law and arrest of Podleśna made Poland internationally "famous for the idiotic attitude of today's rulers who go after artists and those who enjoy freedom of speech".

Ainsworth was an unincorporated community in Ross Township, Lake County, Indiana.
The Grand Trunk Railroad was extended to Ainsworth in 1880.
In the early 1990s the area containing Ainsworth was annexed by the city of Hobart. A failed attempt to fight the annexation would have seen the area incorporated into the town of Ainsworth, thus bringing back the name of the old village. It is located near the intersection of Indiana State Road 51 and the Canadian National Railway (formerly the Grand Trunk Western Railroad).

KNOM (780 AM) and KNOM-FM (96.1 FM) are non-commercial Catholic radio stations in Nome, Alaska. The station owners and licensees are KNOM Radio Mission, Inc., a 501(c)3 nonprofit entity with seven board members. The FM signal has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 1,000 watts and covers the city of Nome and adjacent communities. KNOM AM 780 is considered a Class A station. By day, its signal is powered at 25,000 watts and can be heard as far north as Barter Island and as far south as the Alaska Peninsula, with regular coverage of approximately . With a good radio, it can be heard into the Russian Far East. At night, power is reduced to 14,000 watts.
In addition to its local news, weather, public affairs and religious programming, KNOM broadcasts a wide range of music in various formats. It also broadcasts some nationally syndicated programming, such as the Christian 20 The Countdown Magazine and the secular American Top 40: The 70s.
The station's newsroom is staffed by one full-time news director and several volunteer reporters. An Associated Press member station since 1971, the station dropped its AP affiliation in 2014.
In April 2015, the station was awarded "Best Daily News Program, Radio" in Alaska by the Alaska Press Club.
History
KNOM is the oldest Catholic radio station in the United States, and has been broadcasting in western Alaska for over four decades.
The idea for the station came from James Poole, S.J. While serving at the Jesuit mission in the village of St. Mary's in 1959, Poole created a makeshift "radio station" by wiring 30 homes with speakers linked to the public address system. He was reassigned to Nome in 1966, with fundraising for the station beginning in December of that year.
In 1970, Tom Busch, a young broadcast engineer, moved to Nome, becoming the chief engineer and eventually the station's general manager. After several years of work, Busch and a large team of volunteers gathered the money for the equipment, filled out paperwork with the Federal Communications Commission, built the station, and assembled its original broadcasting equipment. KNOM first went on the air on July 15, 1971. Busch was the general manager of KNOM for more than 30 years.
Poole left KNOM and Alaska in 1988 when he was reassigned to work in Tacoma, Washington. (Although not involved with the mission at that point, his name was used to thank donors. into the late 1990s.) In 2004 the first of what would become dozens of allegations began to emerge of Poole's sexual abuse of Alaska Native women during his time in rural Alaska from the 1960s through the 1980s. Tom Busch personally mailed every person who had donated to the station, explaining that the allegations were true, and detailing the steps the station would make. For several years after, the station actively aired spots aimed at helping victims of sexual abuse.
By April 2005, Busch became development director and part-time engineer. Longtime program director and former volunteer Ric Schmidt became general manager. Tom was a past two-term president of the Alaska Broadcasters Association. Busch died on his 63rd birthday in November 2010 at his home in Anchorage, Alaska.
After the Diocese of Fairbanks declared bankruptcy in February 2008, Busch (until his passing) and Schmidt worked toward incorporating the radio station as a non-profit entity independent of the Catholic Bishop of Northern Alaska. In March 2010 the station emerged as a 501(c)3, under the name "KNOM Radio Mission, Inc.".
In 2019, after an article from the Center of Investigative Reporting described Poole being allowed to retire at the Gonzaga campus after his abuse became publicly known, KNOM's Board of Directors published a statement where they again renounce all of Poole's actions and commit to transparently carrying on with the mission of bringing news, inspiration, and encouragement to Western Alaska.
Current operations
KNOM is able to operate from the dedication of full-time volunteers who move to Nome and support the station in various ways as part of a year of service. In recent years those volunteers have lived in a volunteer house next door to the station building. In addition to healthcare coverage, volunteers are given a small monthly stipend for personal use and split a monthly stipend for food, utilities, and other bills. Upon completing one year of service, volunteers are given an education stipend and a small relocation bonus. Volunteers also have the option to re-apply for a second year.
Currently, KNOM is staffed by a combination of paid staff and volunteers. People who are interested in public service, or professional broadcast training (especially college-age students and senior citizens), are encouraged to apply.
Awards and recognitions
KNOM has won several awards for community service from the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB). It received the Crystal Service award in 1987, 2000, 2003, 2005 and 2012. In 2013 it became the fourth radio station in the United States to receive the Crystal Heritage Award. The station has also won 19 Gabriel awards, as well as honors from the Catholic Academy for Communication Arts Professionals (CACAP), the Alaska Broadcasters Association (ABA), and other organizations.
KNOM has also received recognition from the State of Alaska, the City of Nome, and the Alaska National Guard.

Robert Emile Mabro (26 December 1934 – 2 August 2016) was an academic who specialised in oil and energy issues. He founded the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, and in the late 1990s brokered a historic production cut between OPEC and its rivals in the wake of a slump in the price of oil.
Early life and education
Mabro was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in December 1934, the son of Greek Orthodox parents who had migrated from Tripoli, Lebanon in the 1860s. He graduated with a BSc in Engineering from Alexandria University in 1956, after which he worked as a civil engineer in Egypt for a number of years. In 1960 he joined a Jesuit seminary near Paris and spent the next four years studying philosophy; he then went to London to study economics as a post-graduate student at the School of Oriental & African Studies. He took his MSc in 1966, and then became a researcher in economics at SOAS, where he met Judy, whom he married in 1967.
Career
In 1971, Mabro was made a Fellow of St Antony's College, Oxford. Throughout the 1970s, Mabro's interest in oil- and energy-related matters grew, and he wrote his first monograph on the subject - "Oil Producers and Consumers: Conflict or Cooperation" - in 1974. He founded the Oxford Energy Policy Club in 1976; the club continues to meet biannually and gives oil industry executives and senior government officials from around the world the opportunity to hold informal, off-the-record talks. He set up the Oxford Energy Seminar, which has been held annually since 1979 and is widely recognised as an important international forum on energy. In 1982, Mabro founded the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, an educational charity devoted to researching the economics, politics and impact on international relations of oil, gas and other energies. He served as the institute's Director until 2003, and was made its Honorary President in 2006.
In the 1995 New Year Honours Mabro was appointed a CBE. He was elected a Fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford in 2006. He is widely held in libraries worldwide. He died on Crete, Greece, on 2 August 2016.
1997 oil production cut
In the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, oil prices plunged sharply to below $10 a barrel, which had significant negative effects on the economies of crude oil producers around the world. However, a history of distrust and a desire to protect their own market share was preventing any cooperation to counter the price fall amongst the nations affected. In early 1998, following a meeting in Oxford with Adrian Lajous, the head of Mexico's state-owned oil company Pemex, Mabro held a series of meetings and phone calls in which he acted as an intermediary between officials from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, and their Mexican rivals. This initiative led to joint production cuts in late 1998 and early 1999, the effect of which was that by mid-2000 the price of crude oil had recovered to more than $30 a barrel. Lajous later recalled, "Robert Mabro played a key, if unaccredited, role in the secret negotiations that brought together these three countries." Mabro himself later suggested that OPEC should change its logo to a tea-bag “because it only works in hot water.”

Packera bolanderi is a species of flowering plant in the aster family known by the common names Bolander's ragwort and seacoast ragwort. It is native to the west coast of the United States from Washington to northern California, where it grows in wet coastal forests and woodlands. There are two varieties of the species which differ slightly in morphology and habitat occupied; these varieties have been considered separate species by some authors. The var. bolanderi has thicker leaves, occurs farther south (into California), and occupies more open types of habitat, than does var. harfordii. This plant in general is a perennial herb producing one to three stems up to half a meter tall. The basal leaves have blades up to 12 centimeters long which are divided into several lobes and borne on long, thin petioles. Leaves growing farther up the stem are smaller and have more lobes on their blades. The inflorescence contains several flower heads, each lined with dark green phyllaries. The head contains many golden yellow disc florets and generally either 8 or 13 yellow ray florets each over a centimeter long. The fruit is an achene tipped with a pappus of bristles.

The Kids from Room 402 is an animated series produced by CinéGroupe and Saban Entertainment that premiered on October 9, 1999 on the Fox Family Channel in the USA, and on August 29, 2000 on Teletoon in Canada. It consists of 52 half-hour episodes, the last of which aired in 2000, with reruns airing until 2005. The series was also seen in Latin America and Europe on Fox Kids, with the latter region still airing the series after the Fox Kids channels were purchased by Disney and changed their name to Jetix; remaining on their schedule until the Jetix channels were once again rebranded as Disney XD.
The series is focused primarily on a group of elementary school students. Miss Graves, their teacher, is usually shown as an interlocutor in the issues and injustices that are inflicted upon the students, whether the dilemmas be internal or external. Each episode usually ends with a substantiated moral or lesson resulting from such aforementioned situations.
The series is based on the 40-page children's book Gracie Graves and The Kids from Room 402 by Betty Paraskevas and Michael Paraskevas, published in 1995. This was retitled in 2000 as simply "The Kids from Room 402" to match the series.
The animated series was developed for television by Lesa Kite and Cindy Begel, who wrote all 52 episodes.

He has auburn hair and wears a blue suit. He is smart, clever and practical but also has a very shy personality. He often tries to profit from others, but usually his plans fail.
Freddie Fay (voiced by Bryton McClure) - Freddie is basically classified as a nerd boy in the school and he often bemoans that fact. He has glasses, black hair, wears a yellow shirt and sticks out as an easily found school nerd. He works very hard to have good results and is an A− student. Being silly is frequently mocked by the others, especially Vinnie and Jesse, or fooled by Arthur who sometimes uses him in his plans. E.g. in one episode everyone picked on him because they thought he had wet his pants, when actually the water fountain sprayed him by accident.
Charlie (voiced by Crystal Scales) - An African-American boy who looks slightly similar to Sanjay, with dark hair and a red shirt. He often wins what Nancy should have won. In one episode, the class switched seats to fool Mr. Besser when he became a substitute teacher, and when Nancy's report was worth an A, Mr. Besser mistook her for Charlie due to the seating arrangement plans (since he knew few of the students' names except for Jesse and Vinnie, whom he often put in detention). And when Jesse got glasses that he couldn't see with, he was the swing vote between Nancy and Charlie, and, while intending to vote for Nancy, voted for Charlie by mistake because he couldn't see the names clearly.
Jordan (voiced by Tara Strong) - A Chinese-American girl who is very rich, but keeps that in a secret. Nancy finds out in one episode, promising Jordan to keep the secret out of fear her friends will think she's a snob. To keep them from knowing, she did not invite anyone to her house, which caused some people to think she's poor. However, when Nancy bragged so much about having a wealthy friend (without telling anyone she was referring to Jordan) her other friends started avoiding her like Jordan feared would happen to her if they knew she was wealthy.
Gabrielle (voiced by Olivia Hack) - A girl who is usually seen with Jordan and Nancy. She mostly goes along with everything Jordan thinks or does, and although she is Nancy's friend, sometimes argues with her.
Tillie (voiced by Tifanie Christun) - Another of Nancy's friends, a tall girl with brown hair who is somewhat self-absorbed.
Jenny (voiced by Jane Woods) - A girl with red glasses who doesn't have much participation in the class.
Piggy McCall (voiced by Justin Jon Ross) - A slightly fat boy with glasses who is also a minor character, and doesn't interact much with the others.
Melanie Bellanchof (voiced by Debi Derryberry) - A new student to the school, she is Mrs. Bellanchof's daughter, her parents are either divorced or split up, as Melanie comes to town to live with her mother. She doesn't like living with her, and when referring to anything that she doesn't like will say either "Don't know", "Don't care" or "Smells". At her house, she is mostly seen on the phone talking to a friend from her old school named Gloria.
Other kids
Sanjay (voiced by Tara Strong) - An Indian-American student with dark brown hair, a maroon shirt, and speaks with an accent, who looks slightly similar to Charlie. He is often irritated by Polly.
Mary-Ellen (voiced by Colleen O'Shaughnessey) - A girl who is one of Nancy's friends. Doesn't have much participation in the series.
Joey Tuna - A tall boy who is often seen sitting next to Jesse in the series. Another character that doesn't have much participation in the series.
Zack (voiced by Sam Saletta) - The bully of the school and a recurring antagonist.
Adults
Miss Gracie Graves (voiced by April Winchell) - Miss Gracie Graves is a really good teacher. She acts as the voice of reason, which is why most of her students go to her whenever they seek help or advice.
Mr. Stuart Besser (voiced by Rodger Bumpass) - Mr. Stuart Besser is the incompetent principal of the school. Noted for his stupidity and overweight stature, he is often satirized, whether it be vocal or written, by his students. His negligence and ignorance serves as recurring comic relief within the television show. Mr. Besser was once married to Vinnie's aunt, much to the shock of both males (Vinnie didn't know Mr. Besser was his aunt's husband and Mr. Besser didn't know Vinnie is his wife's nephew until the two of them met during the wedding party) but the wedding ended when she learned he expected to live at her expenses. Mr. Besser was oblivious to the fact Vinnie didn't like being his nephew.
Nurse Pitts (voiced by Lori Alan) - The school nurse. She's obsessed with illness and also talks a lot about death. The kids, as well as the teachers, are scared of her.
Coach (voiced by Bruce Dinsmore) - The school gym teacher.
Roberta McCoy (voiced by Edie McClurg) - Jesse's overprotective mother. She usually treats Jesse like a baby and embarrasses him near his friends who sometimes mock him.
Mrs. Amy Bellanchof (voiced by Pauline Little) - Melanie's mother who is a teacher attending Melanie's new school. However, as she didn't have a lesson plan, her students made a bit of progress, which put her on the verge of getting fired. Although Miss Graves helped her improve her class by sharing her lesson plan, Mrs. Bellanchof dishonestly passed Miss Graves' plan as her own to win an award. In other acts that show her lack of honesty, she got custody of her daughter by lying to the judge about which parent Melanie would rather live with, and used her position at the school to have her daughter join the cheerleading squad despite Melanie trying to tell her she doesn't want to be a cheerleader. She also loses her temper easily, especially when Melanie complains and tells her she wants to go back to live with her father, pulling her hair and screaming when she is overly angry or stressed.
Mrs. Francis (voiced by April Winchell) - Nancy's mother.
Cameo adults
Mrs. Myerson (voiced by April Winchell) - She is a stout woman with a very pleasant and respectable disposition. She wears a pink dress and has blonde hair. She lives in a neighborhood around the school. She briefly appears a few times in the episode "Bing, Bing, Bing, and a Shot".
Mr. Miller (voiced by Mel Brooks) - He is the pool official of a pool in Miami that Nancy goes to visit. He gives her a hard time about things like hygiene. He appears in the episode "Squeezed Out".

John Earle Sullivan (born ), also known as Activist John, is an American political activist and self-identified photojournalist who participated in the 2021 United States Capitol attack.
Before the January 6 attack, Sullivan organized and participated in protests relating to the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, though a few other BLM organizers explicitly disavowed him, even expelling Sullivan from rallies and warning fellow activists to avoid associating with Sullivan.
On January 6, Sullivan entered the Capitol and broke a window. He repeatedly shouted encouragement to fellow rioters. Sullivan captured footage of the attack, his own interactions with law enforcement, and the shooting of Ashli Babbitt.
After Sullivan participated in the Capitol attack, some theories accuse Sullivan of being affiliated with antifa, though federal authorities had not identified him as such and he has stated that he has no relationship to the antifa movement. By May 2021, Sullivan faced eight charges for his involvement in the January 6th events.
Early life and family
Sullivan was adopted into a conservative Mormon family. His father, John Sullivan Sr., was a lieutenant colonel in the US Army. Sullivan has three younger brothers. Sullivan grew up in Stafford, Virginia. Around 2013, the family moved to Utah.
After graduating from high school, Sullivan applied to be a police officer.
Sullivan got involved in speed skating and in 2016, Sullivan was featured in a commercial blog post on Uber's site, describing him as "searching for a way to earn money that fit with his busy training schedule". Sullivan participated in the 2018 Olympic trials but failed to qualify; Despite this, he has claimed to have "competed in the 2018 Olympic Games".
Activism prior to the 2021 Capitol attack
In June 2020, Sullivan began to attend Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests. According to Lex Scott, the founder of Black Lives Matter-Utah, none of the activists knew him before this time.
Civilized Awakening and Insurgence USA
Conservative activist James Sullivan, John's brother, reports that John was conservative "until recently". James Sullivan founded "Civilized Awakening", part of the greater far-right Patriot movement.
In June 2020, John Sullivan founded "Insurgence USA", a group participating in protests against police violence. Sullivan was accused of exploiting the racial justice movement for self-gain. The Salt Lake Tribune observed that Sullivan had been selling merchandise and indulging in self-promotion on many websites; his Insurgence USA website sells protest-related gear, such as black clothing, gloves, and gas masks, branded "bloc gear collective".
Car protest, shooting and arrest
On June 29, 2020, Sullivan led his first protest event, in Provo, Utah. BLM leader Lex Scott recalled: "His very first protest he held was the one someone got shot". The event was a counter-protest against a pro-police event where a Back the Blue group drove vehicles driving around the Provo police station. Meanwhile, Sullivan and others organized a counter-protest blocking vehicles and interfering with traffic on a busy street. One man affiliated with Sullivan, Jesse Taggart, was charged with attempted murder for shooting and injuring a driver who had slowly moved through the crowd of protestors. The shooting victim was not affiliated with either protest group.
Sullivan was arrested and charged with rioting, making a threat of violence and criminal mischief. According to a police affidavit, Sullivan damaged vehicles and cooperated with Insurgence USA to recruit protesters for a protest. Sullivan indicated that he thought the driver Taggart shot was trying to run over protesters, a claim police disputed based on video evidence of the event.
Ties to Proud Boys
Sullivan organized events in Provo, Utah that were controversial with BLM. Sullivan experienced greater skepticism after a July 1, 2020 event where he invited speeches from the Proud Boys, an American far-right, neo-fascist organization that promotes and engages in political violence. Sullivan's close relationship with the Proud Boys led to BLM activists refusing to work with him. Sullivan later got his group firearms training. On September 26, Sullivan's brother James had addressed a Proud Boys rally in Portland on behalf of James's far-right group Civilized Awakening.
Criticism for armed protest
On July 22, 2020, Sullivan held a solo, armed protest at the Utah State Capitol, carrying an AR-15. The protest lasted a few hours, during which he was confronted by twenty armed men from Utah Citizens' Alarm. As he began carrying assault rifles to protest, this invited hostility from both the right and the left.
In August 2020, Sullivan was filmed giving a speech outside the US Capitol. Sullivan spoke of "burning this shit down" and told the crowd "we gotta rip Trump out of that office right over there" while pointing to the White House; he added "we ain't fucking waiting til the next election". Lex Scott said that Sullivan seemed to have "a death wish" as he thought it would be "cool, or amazing, if he was killed at a protest and it started a revolution". She has also denied Sullivan is a member of BLM-Utah and expressed suspicions of his seeking fame, adding he never attended any BLM meetings nor worked alongside them to advance their agenda.
Work with Jade Sacker
According to James Sullivan, by October 2020, he and his brother John were subjects of a documentary being filmed by Jade Sacker. Sacker reportedly used two teams to document the brothers' efforts. Sacker would later accompany John Sullivan into the Capitol on January 6.
Denounced and expelled
An activist from Portland warned people not to trust him, after he managed to get local activists arrested in September 2020 by leading them down a wrong route and into a police kettle; Sullivan was widely-suspected of being a double agent working for law enforcement. In Signal chat groups, Sullivan would use various sock puppet accounts to create the illusion that others were defending the reputation of John Sullivan. Labor activist Talia Jane said Sullivan is "reviled throughout the activist space".
On September 16, James Sullivan and Civilized Awakening held a counterprotest against BLM. James brought a bodyguard to a BLM protest; that individual was arrested on charges of brandishing a firearm.
On November 26, 2020, Seattle activists published a memo accusing John Sullivan of being an agent provocateur seeking to undermine the Black Lives Matter movement:
"John has been kicked from the #SaltLakeCity and #Portland protest scenes due to alarming behaviors including grifting/profiteering, self-promotion/clout chasing, sabotage of community actions, threats of violence, and — maybe most disturbingly — ties to the far-right ... John's brother, James, is the co-founder of a pro-Trump org called 'Civilized Awakening,' and has strong ties to Proud Boys — even having spoken at a Proud Boy rally. The brothers' polarized political stances conveniently bolster the other's public personas. Activists in these cities recommend that he be barred from community actions and totally avoided."
On December 12, Pro- and Anti-Trump activists traveled to Washington DC. Brawls broke, four people were stabbed. That day, John Sullivan was escorted from an event at Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington after he was identified by activists aware of the accusations against him.
That same day, James Sullivan was similarly evicted from a Pro-Trump event in Washington.
Participation in the 2021 Capitol attack
John Sullivan participated in the storming of the United States Capitol. He wore a ballistic vest and gas mask, entering the building through a broken window. Sullivan took extensive video, including video of the shooting of Ashli Babbitt. Sullivan could be heard saying "Dude, this shit's gonna go viral" after Babbitt's death.
Sullivan filmed himself chanting "we about to burn this shit down" and "we accomplished this shit. We did this together. Fuck yeah! We are all a part of this history", "We gotta get this shit burned", and "It's our house, motherfuckers!" He also used a megaphone and shouted support.
Speaker's Lobby
Outside the Speaker's lobby, Sullivan filmed himself telling others in the crowd that he has a knife. He later denied having a knife, claiming he "used that to navigate myself to the front of the crowd".
Upon reaching the front of the crowd, he told a law enforcement officer guarding the barricaded door: "We want you to go home. I'm recording and there's so many people and they're going to push their
way up here. Bro, I've seen people out there get hurt. I don't want to see you get
hurt."
Public interviews
Moments after Babbitt was shot, Sullivan gave an impromptu interview with a streamer identifying as working for Infowars. Later that night, Sullivan and Jade Sacker appeared on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360°, showing Sullivan's footage of the Babbitt shooting.
Detention and FBI interview
On January 7, Sullivan was reportedly detained by DC Metro police.
On January 7, Sullivan was interviewed by FBI agents about the shooting. Sullivan said he is not affiliated with BLM or antifa, nor with the pro-Trump crowd, although he supports Black Lives Matter. When asked about the use of antifa hashtags in his social media posts, he rejected being associated with the group, but has stated that he, along with his group, is anti-fascist. He admitted to shouting support during the attack, but claimed he only did these things to "blend in" with the pro-Trump mob. His brother, James Sullivan, said that he sent the FBI tips about John Sullivan about a week after the attack.
On January 13, 2021, an arrest warrant with three counts related to the Washington DC riot was signed by a magistrate judge. The affidavit was based on work by the Counterterrorism Section of the United States Department of Justice National Security Division and the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia. The affidavit stated that Sullivan entered the Capitol's west side by climbing through a broken window. He later approached another window and a knocking noise was heard, after which it was broken. Sullivan stated, "I broke it. My bad, my apologies. Well they already broke a window, so you know, I didn't know I hit it that hard. No one got that on camera." One charge, "40 U.S.C. § 5104(e)(2)(D)", is a specific crime of entering or remaining in the House of Congress without authorization.
Arrest and charges
Sullivan was arrested in Tooele County, Utah, and appeared before a judge on January 15, 2021. Two computers, two cell phones, and camera equipment were seized by the FBI. He was released with strict pre-trial conditions. He was released as the authorities did not have sufficient proof to keep him in custody, and under the conditions that he keeps a job where he has to work full-time; remains at home except to go to work, church or court; only posts to social media to request jobs; does not leave Utah and surrenders his passport to the authorities; does not work anymore with Insurgence USA though still being allowed to handle its financial transactions and tax returns; has a mental health evaluation; does not possess firearms.
Antifa conspiracy theory
Sullivan's involvement in the riots was cited by pro-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and The Gateway Pundit as part of a false theory alleging antifa's involvement in the riots.
Giuliani published a screen shot of a message from James Sullivan reading "I'm currently working with the FBI to expose and place total blame on John and the 226 members of antifa that instigated the Capitol 'riot'".
Federal authorities had not identified Sullivan as a member of antifa and the FBI had announced on January 8 there was no evidence of antifa involvement in the siege. BLM Utah had for months disassociated itself from Sullivan on concerns that he might be associated with the Proud Boys.
Claims of being a journalist
Sullivan has called himself a citizen journalist and claimed he was at the Capitol attack only as a photojournalist. An FBI affidavit disputes the claim he was a photojournalist, as he had no press credentials. Prosecutors allege that in December 2020, Sullivan publicly denied being a journalist.
Sullivan's own recording is a described as a first-person documentary film he released on YouTube under the title Shooting and Storming of the US Capitol in Washington DC. J. Hoberman, a film critic writing in Artforum, reviewed Sullivan's film, describing it as "cinema as forensic evidence" and comparing it to the Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination, while also characterizing it as a "gonzo reportage". Parts of the footage were used in the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump. CNN, NBC News, Australian Broadcasting Corporation and The Washington Post were among the media outlets that paid Sullivan for his video.
When entering the capitol, Sullivan was accompanied by Jade Sacker, a Los Angeles-based independent documentary filmmaker, who was filming John Sullivan as part of a documentary on him and his brother, James.

The Dacia 1300 () is a medium-sized family car that was built during the Cold War by Romanian automaker Dacia. The "1300" stands for the engine displacement.
The first Dacia 1300 left the assembly line on 23 August 1969. On 21 July 2004, the last Dacia 1310 (sedan version), number 1,959,730, rolled out the gates of the Mioveni production facility, just one month before its 35th anniversary.
History
Dacia 1300
The Romanian government of the 1960s had decided to acquire the tooling and basic design of a western car to decrease Romania's reliance on imported consumer goods. Terms stated that the vehicle had to be inexpensive, large enough for a family, and powered by an engine displacing not more than 1.3 litres. Offers came from Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Austin, DKW, Peugeot among others, but the winner was the Renault 12. The choice of a French design was not only political but also technical; Romania was attempting to cultivate economic relationships with Western Europe, particularly France, and to demonstrate its economic capabilities.
Part of the resulting vehicles were sold to consumers in the Eastern Bloc, and in export markets such as South America, Canada, China, and North Korea, but also Great Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands. When automobile production started at the Mioveni factory, the Renault 12 was still a prototype; for this reason, Renault offered CKD kits and tooling for the older Renault 8 Major as a temporary surrogate. This resulted in the Dacia 1100, which was built for a few years until the 1300 would arrive. Both the R12 and its licensed copy were launched in 1969, although the 1300 was launched 9 days before the R12, on the 23 August parade. During the first few years of production, the plant assembled CKD kits imported from France. At the time of its launch, the 1300 was a modern car offering good comfort, safety, good performance and reliability, and even more so by Eastern standards of the time, set by 1960s and 70s Eastern Bloc vehicles.
The 1300 was subject to multiple facelifts in an effort to maintain consumers' interest in the model, but the basic design was kept for its entire 35-year lifespan. Although performance and fuel consumption were gradually improved, quality didn't always meet the standard once they had stopped importing CKD kits. Body panel corrosion became the model's primary problem. Air conditioning, airbags and anti-lock brakes were never offered.
The estate version, Dacia 1300 Break, went into production in 1973, and in 1975, the Dacia 1302, a pickup truck derived from the 1300 platform, was introduced.
Dacia 1310 series
After the cooperation with Renault ceased in 1978, Dacia presented a revised version of the 1300 at the 1979 Bucharest Auto Show. In 1982, its name was changed to Dacia 1310, and later also came "1210", "1410" and a few other versions.
In 1983, the whole range was facelifted for the 1984 model year. A coupé version of the car, the 1410 Sport, with two doors and a lowered roof, was also released in 1983. In 1987 the Dacia 1320 liftback was introduced.
In 1989, a new generation Dacia 1310 was launched in estate and sedan versions. It was a minor modification of the previous generation with new headlights. A new liftback version named Dacia 1325 Liberta was introduced in 1990. The 1310 van was also launched in 1990. The fully facelifted Dacia 13xx range was introduced in 1993.
By the 1980s, the model was becoming dated and its chassis was no longer able to meet safety standards of the era, prompting Dacia to start work on a replacement. However, financial and political setbacks caused that replacement, the Dacia Nova, to be delayed until 1994, by which time it was already outdated. Although the newer Nova range (later evolving into Dacia SupeRNova and Dacia Solenza) sold well and displayed better road manners, it never replaced the 1310 range, due to its higher price, smaller interior and other disappointing factors (such as being offered only in a liftback body).
Therefore, Dacia was forced to facelift the 1310 model yet again, in 1998. The last 1310 model was simply named "Berlina" or "Break", for sedan or estate respectively. In an effort to keep up with modern standards, the last version was equipped with fuel injection and a catalytic converter, meeting Euro2 emission standards.
Since the original model in 1969, constant change in automobile size meant that the 1310 was a compact sedan by the end of its production, despite having started life as a mid-size car. For a few months in 2004, Dacia offered three different small sedan models simultaneously.
The model scored solid sale numbers right up to its last day of production, mainly due to its low price, value for money, and easy and inexpensive maintenance. The sedan ("Berlina") and the estate ("Break") had €4,100 and €4,250 price tags respectively in 2004. The Liberta liftback had been dropped in 1996, but production of the sedan and estate was over in 2004. The "Pick-Up" range ended production in December 2006. The Dacia Logan replaced the 1300/1310 model in 2004.

Mentmore Towers, historically known simply as "Mentmore", is a 19th-century English country house built between 1852 and 1854 for the Rothschild family in the village of Mentmore in Buckinghamshire. Sir Joseph Paxton and his son-in-law, George Henry Stokes, designed the building in the 19th-century revival of late 16th and early 17th-century Elizabethan and Jacobean styles called Jacobethan. The house was designed for the banker and collector of fine art Baron Mayer de Rothschild as a country home, and as a display case for his collection of fine art. The mansion has been described as one of the greatest houses of the Victorian era. Mentmore was inherited by Hannah Primrose, Countess of Rosebery, née Rothschild, and owned by her descendants, the Earls of Rosebery.
Mentmore was the first of what were to become virtual Rothschild estates in the Vale of Aylesbury. Baron Mayer de Rothschild began purchasing land in the area in 1846. Later, other members of the family built houses at Tring in Hertfordshire, Ascott, Aston Clinton, Waddesdon and Halton.
Much of the estate was sold in 1944, but the mansion, its grounds, formal gardens several farms and the majority of the village of Mentmore remained in the ownership of Harry Primrose, 6th Earl of Rosebery, until his death in 1974. The Earl's executors explored the possibility of Mentmore Towers along with its contents being preserved intact as a heritage property and opened to the public, as has been the case with some other National Trust properties. Despite prolonged discussions between the Executors and Government representatives over the following three years, no agreement to save the house for the nation was reached. Thus, in 1977, the contents of the house were sold at public auction by Sotheby's. The following year the empty mansion with its formal gardens and 80 acres were sold to the Maharishi Foundation who occupied it for the next two decades. In 1999, it was again sold, to investor Simon Halabi, who planned to build additional hotel and conference facilities. In 1992 the Mentmore Golf and Country Club opened, with two 18-hole courses.
Mentmore Towers is a Grade I listed building, with its park and gardens listed Grade II*.
Architecture
Baron Rothschild commissioned Sir Joseph Paxton, who was then designing and supervising construction of the much-admired Crystal Palace, to design Mentmore. Paxton was responsible for the ridge and furrow glass roof which covered the central hall, designed to imitate the arcaded courtyard of a Renaissance palazzo, while Stokes was co-architect and clerk of works. The builder was the London firm George Myers, frequently employed by members of the Rothschild family.
In keeping with the contents intended to be displayed within, the interiors take their inspiration principally from the Italian Renaissance, although the house also contains drawing rooms and cabinets decorated in the gilded styles of late 18th-century France. The external design is closely based on that of Robert Smythson's Wollaton Hall.
Earls of Rosebery
Baron Mayer de Rothschild and his wife enjoyed the house for over twenty years before their deaths, his in 1874 and the Baroness's some eighteen months later. The house and estate were then inherited by their daughter Hannah, later Countess of Rosebery. Following her death from Bright's Disease in 1890 at age 39, the house became the home of her widower Archibald Philip Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, later Prime Minister for two years from 1894. In 1922, the fifth earl gave the estate to his son Harry Meyer Archibald Primrose, Lord Dalmeny, who in 1929 on the death of his father, became the sixth Earl.
Both earls bred numerous winners of classic horse races at the two stud farms on the estate, including five Epsom Derby winners. These were Ladas, Sir Visto, and Cicero from the Crafton Stud; plus Ocean Swell and Blue Peter from the Mentmore stud. Both stud farms were within a kilometre of the mansion and together with the stable yard were designed by the architect George Devey, who also designed many cottages in the estate's villages of Mentmore, Crafton and Ledburn.
Second World War
The second wife of the sixth Earl, Eva Primrose, Countess of Rosebery (DBE), was interested in the arts and was acquainted with Kenneth Clark and other national art museum directors. As a result of Lady Rosebery's friendships, Mentmore was chosen by the British government to store part of the British national art collections during the Second World War. The collections of the National Portrait Gallery were subsequently stored at Mentmore for the duration of the war, along with pieces from the Royal Collection, including the Gold State Coach. Further works transferred to Mentmore included the portraits from Speaker's House in the Palace of Westminster, and tapestries, furniture and Grinling Gibbons carvings from Hampton Court Palace.
The royal coach was stored in the "battery room" subsequently nicknamed the "refuge", part of the "gas house", a group of outbuildings where gas and electricity had once been produced for the estate. Four men guarded the refuge at night, and two during the day.
Sale and dispersal
The possible purchase of Mentmore for the nation through the government's National Land Fund was the desire of Roy Strong, the director of the V&A, who hoped that Mentmore would become a "branch" of his museum devoted to 19th-century decorative arts as Ham House was for the 17th century and Osterley was for the 18th century. The government refused to spend such large sums from the fund, and the sale fell through.
Following the death of the sixth earl in 1974, the Labour government of James Callaghan refused to accept the contents in lieu of inheritance taxes, which could have turned the house into one of England's finest museums of European furniture, objets d'art and Victorian era architecture. The government was offered the house and contents for UK £2 million () but declined.
After three more years of fruitless discussion, the executors of the estate sold the contents by public auction, and the large collection was dispersed. The estate made over £6,000,000, but a tiny fraction of its estimated worth today. Among the paintings sold were works by Gainsborough, Reynolds, Boucher, Drouais, Moroni and other well known artists, and cabinetmakers, including Jean Henri Riesener and Chippendale. Also represented were the finest German and Russian silver- and goldsmiths, and makers of Limoges enamel. This Rothschild/Mentmore collection is said to have been one of the finest ever to be assembled in private hands, other than the collections of the Russian and British royal families. The sale of Mentmore has been described as a "turning point for the preservation movement".
Several family portraits, sculptures and furnishing were relocated from Mentmore prior to the sale by the Roseberys to their ancestral Scottish home, Dalmeny House, near Edinburgh. Items from Mentmore at Dalmeny include tapestries, Sèvres porcelain, and an equestrian statue by Joseph Boehm of "King Tom", the foundation stallion for Baron Mayer de Rothschild's Mentmore and Crafton Studs.
Maharishi Foundation
Mentmore became the headquarters for Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's educational charity, the Maharishi Foundation, in 1978. As of 1997 the Natural Law Party also rented rooms there. The building was put up for sale in 1997 but did not change owners until 1999 when it was purchased by investor Simon Halabi.
Simon Halabi
Under the ownership of Halabi the property was renamed Mentmore Towers Ltd with the intention of converting it into a luxury hotel with 171 suites, including 122 in a new wing on the slope below the house. However, in September 2004 Jonathan Davey, a local resident, won a last-minute injunction in the High Court to halt work on the hotel while a judicial review investigated if the planning permission granted had followed the correct procedures. In March 2005 the High Court ruled that Aylesbury Vale District Council's decision to grant planning permission to the developers was "unimpeachable" and legally sound.
However, with Halabi's property empire in serious trouble due to the housing market's collapse, the project seems to have stalled. English Heritage has placed it on the "At Risk register" and the house needs urgent work on the roof and chimneys. There is concern that weather will penetrate to the interiors, considered among the finest examples of Victorian design and craftsmanship in Britain. Halabi's property company, Buckingham Securities Holdings, was also proposing to develop the In & Out Club at 79–81 Piccadilly, London, also known as Cambridge House, before it became the Naval and Military Club and once occupied by Lord Palmerston. The intention was to turn both properties into Europe's first six-star hotels, one located in town and the other to be the sister Country Manor hotel with 36 hole private golf clubs. The original architects, EPR were replaced by AFR in 2005 but the development stalled in 2007. In 2004 Hotel Design Inc were retained as interior designers for both projects leading to a 2005 launch event for the marketing of the properties as a private members' club with hotel facilities (the PM Club).
The latest proposal after the sister, Piccadilly property was sold to the Rueben Brothers in 2009, was to renovate the original Mentmore Towers building and not construct the new extension containing guest-room suites, conference facilities and a large spa.
Golf courses
Much of the historic estate was sold off in 1944 and reverted to agricultural use before becoming the Mentmore Golf and Country Club, established in 1992, which had two eighteen-hole golf courses designed by Bob Sandow, the Rothschild Course and the Rosebery Course. The club ceased trading in 2015.
Film location
The house has appeared in many films, including Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985), Slipstream (1989), Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut (1999), Philip Kaufman's Marquis de Sade biographical film Quills (2000), The Mummy Returns (2001), Ali G Indahouse (2002) as the Prime Minister's residence Chequers, Johnny English (2003), and Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005), where it was used as the Gothic Wayne Manor. It was used extensively in the 2021 film Infinite with Mark Wahlberg.
In 1982 director Howard Guard filmed the Roxy Music video to "Avalon", starring Sophie Ward, at the house. It also served as the filming location of Mike Oldfield's Alex Proyas-directed "Magic Touch" (1987/88), Enya's Dan Nathan-directed "Only If ..." (1997), the Five Max and Dania-directed "Until the Time Is Through", the Spice Girls Howard Greenhalgh-directed "Goodbye" (1998) and ATC's Patric Ullaeus-directed "Thinking of You" (2000) music videos. It was also featured as the location of the rave party in the Inspector Morse episode "Cherubim and Seraphim".

The 464th Bombardment Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force unit. Its last assignment was with 382d Bombardment Group at Camp Anza, California, where it was inactivated on 4 January 1946. From 1942 the squadron served as a replacement training unit for heavy bomber aircrews. It was inactivated in the spring of 1944 in a general reorganization of Army Air Forces training units. The squadron was activated again in 1944 as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress unit.
History
Heavy bomber replacement training
The 464th Bombardment Squadron was first activated in July 1942 at Salt Lake City Army Air Base, Utah as one of the original squadrons of the 331st Bombardment Group. In September it moved to Casper Army Air Field, where it conducted Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress replacement training until 1943, when it converted to the Consolidated B-24 Liberator. Replacement training units were oversized units which trained aircrews prior to their deployment to combat theaters. However, the Army Air Forces found that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization, were not proving to be well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, it adopted a more functional system in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit, while the groups and squadrons acting as replacement training units were disbanded or inactivated. This resulted in the 462d, along with other units at Casper, being inactivated in the spring of 1944 and being replaced by the 211th AAF Base Unit (Combat Crew Training Station, Heavy), which assumed the 331st Group's mission, personnel, and equipment.
Very heavy bomber operations
Redesignated as a B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombardment Squadron in August 1944; trained under Second Air Force. Training considerably delayed due to equipment shortages, received B-29 aircraft in Salina, Kansas in late spring 1945. Ground echelon deployed to Northern Mariana Islands by ship in early August 1945; air echelon remained at last training base in Kansas after Japanese Capitulation. Ground echelon remained in Marianas supporting other units aircraft and demobilization; air echelon demobilized with new B-29 aircraft remaining in Kansas, eventually being assigned to postwar units. Entire unit inactivated by December 1945.

Umagico is a town and coastal locality in the Northern Peninsula Area Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , Umagico had a population of 427 people.
Umagico is one of the five communities which collectively form the Northern Peninsula Area, also known as the NPA. The landmass of the NPA consists of 1,030 km2 in the northernmost region of Cape York Peninsula, Injinoo, New Mapoon, Seisia and Bamaga communities make up the remainder of the NPA. There is an undeveloped town Aloa () located on the coast.
History
Umagico, originally and still locally known as Alau, was one of several traditional Aboriginal camping sites on the western beaches of Northern Cape York Peninsula. The Gumakudin people are thought to have traditionally occupied Alau prior to first contact.
In 1897, Archibald Meston submitted a report on the Aborigines of Queensland in which he suggested the population between Newcastle Bay and Cape York had decreased from 3,000 to less than 300 people. By 1900, Aboriginal populations in the Cape York Peninsula area had been decimated as a result of introduced disease, exclusions from traditional hunting grounds, and by the brutality of the Native Police and Somerset's Police Magistrates, most notoriously Frank Jardine.
By 1915, remnants of the Aboriginal population had autonomously regrouped at Red Island Point (later known as Seisia) and Cowal Creek (known then as Small River and later than Injinoo). Both communities approached the Queensland Government for land to establish gardens, leading to the creation of an Aboriginal reserve at Cowal Creek in 1915.
By 1918, the Cowal Creek community was functioning as a self-sufficient community, managed by a self-elected council. The community grew during the 1920s and 1930s with the inclusion of Aboriginal groups who moved from the McDonnell Ranges, Red Island Point and Seven Rivers. In 1923, Anglican missionaries and school teachers arrived at Cowal Creek and increasingly took on administrative functions in the community.
To accommodate the Saibai Islanders and other Torres Strait Islander people who had decided to move to the NPA, the government created a reserve at Red Island Point in 1948. This reserve was amalgamated with the adjoining Cowal Creek Reserve. After the amalgamation, the reserve consisted of 97,620 acres populated by around 350 people.
During the 1950s, many of the Saibai Islanders who established themselves at Muttee Heads and Red Island Point moved to Bamaga as the government developed the township, erected accommodation and developed agricultural and sawmilling industries. Bamaga was established as the administrative centre for the NPA.
Umagico was established in 1963 when the government relocated 64 Aboriginal people from Lockhart River Mission to the area. After the Anglican Church relinquished responsibility for the Lockhart River Mission in 1960, the government proposed closing down the mission and resettling residents at Bamaga. The majority of residents rejected this proposal and remained at the old mission site. Those resettled at Umagico accepted the site as an alternative.
After the Lockhart River community was re-established at the current site by the government in 1970, some of the people who had been relocated to the Umagico area in the 1960s returned to live at Lockhart. At this time, people from Moa Island in the western Torres Strait were also resettled at Umagico.
Population
After World War II, populations in Northern Cape York Peninsula were again transformed, as Torres Strait Islanders began resettling in the area. The government began developing the area to accommodate this settlement and encouraged other Islanders to come. Saibai Islanders affected by a storm surge that inundated their island in 1948, had also established communities at Red Island Point at Muttee Heads.
Facilities
The Northern Peninsula Area Regional Council operates the Umagico Indigenous Knowledge Centre at 8 Charlie Street.

The Rag-Time Four was an American Quartet performance group circa 1898 to 1899, they were known for popularizing a version of the cakewalk dance. The four members of the group were Saint Suttle, Gertie Brown, John Brewster, and Maud Brewster. Suttle and Brewster were called the "Blackville Twins", while their female partners were called "their best girls". The group performed vaudeville in Chicago, along with in Milwaukee and Duluth. One of the groups cakewalk events was named Coontown 400.
History
The origin of the cakewalk was a way for enslaved people to mock their masters, during the Antebellum South-period.
"The Two Real Ragtime Coons" was a name given to Suttle and Brown when they performed Vaudeville. The two were involved with many different projects together, with performance and minstrel shows in Chicago, including their involvement in the film Something Good – Negro Kiss (1898).

Tharik Hussain (; born 1979) is a Bangladeshi-born, British-Muslim author, travel writer, journalist and broadcaster, specialising in Muslim heritage and Muslim travel.
Early life
Hussain was born in Golapganj Upazila, Sylhet District, Bangladesh, and grew up in Tower Hamlets, London, England.
Education
Hussain attended Raine's Foundation School and Newham Sixth Form College, before graduating from Middlesex University with a bachelor's degree in Media and Cultural Studies with Journalism. He trained as a Lecturer of Further Education with Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills at the University of Greenwich and holds a Master of Arts in Islamic Studies from Birkbeck, University of London.
Media career
Hussain began his media career as a news reporter, before developing his specialism through his travels exploring Europe's forgotten Muslim heritage.
Between 2001 and 2006, Hussain held the roles of journalist at Eastern Eye, chief editor at bilingual local newspaper Stepney Voice and copyeditor at Saudi Gazette. Since 2014, he has been freelancing as a journalist, travel writer and broadcaster.
In January 2016, Hussain became a destination guide writer for Lonely Planet after working on the first-ever Hajj Guide in the fifth edition of the Oman, UAE and Arabian Peninsula travel guide. Shortly after, Hussain left for America to record his two part radio documentary for the BBC World Service called America's Mosques, a story of integration, which tells the story of Islam in America through some of its mosques, both old and new. During his travels, Hussain visited two of the country's oldest mosques and spent time with the American-Bangladeshi community.
In July 2016, an exhibition of Hussain's travel photography called Don't Forget About Us: a Journey Through Europe's Muslim Heritage at the London Muslim Centre was London's first on Europe's Muslim heritage. Hussain is a regular contributor to travel platforms like Lonely Planet and Culture Trip.
In January 2018, he returned to the USA to record Muslims in Trump's America, also for the BBC World Service. This time he looked at life for Muslim Americans in states like Iowa and West Virginia a year into the Donald Trump presidency.
Books
In 2018, he travelled to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia to research and write the travel guides in the sixth edition of Lonely Planet's Oman, UAE and Arabian Peninsula.
His debut travel narrative book Minarets in the Mountains: A Journey into Muslim Europe is about a road trip Hussain and his family took in the summer of 2016 through the Western Balkans in search of Europe's indigenous Muslim communities, history and heritage. In the book, he also traces the footsteps of the Ottoman traveller Evliya Celebi.
Heritage Work
In 2019, Hussain created Britain's Muslim Heritage Trails in Surrey, England for the Everyday Muslim Heritage and Archive Project, Britain's first self-guided trails dedicated to Islamic heritage.
The two trails he created are called The Woking Trail and The Muslim Cemetery Walk. These were launched in July 2019 by Sir Laurie Magnus, the Chairman of Historic England. The Woking Trail links three of Britain's most important Muslim sites: the country's first purpose-built mosque and only Grade I listed mosque, the Shah Jahan Mosque, and the country's only Muslim military burial ground, The Woking Muslim War Cemetery (now known as the Peace Garden) in the town of Woking, and Britain's first Muslim burial site, The Muhammadan Cemetery (now known as the Muslim Burial Ground) in Brookwood Cemetery.
The Muslim Cemetery Walk takes visitors to some of the most important graves in The Muslim Burial Ground. This includes the grave of the founder of the Muhammadan Cemetery and the Shah Jahan Mosque, Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner, convert Qur'an translator, Muhammad Marmaduke Pickthall, convert founder of the Woking Muslim Mission, Lord Headley, Sufi leader, Idries Shah, one of the last Ottoman princesses, Dürrüşehvar Sultan, and the celebrated architect, Dame Zaha Hadid. The trail also includes the forgotten grave of a Meccan princess and direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, HRH Musbah Haidar, whose father was the last Sherif of Mecca and whose mother was a British-Irish woman. Hussain personally rediscovered the grave during his research for the trails. The maps for both trails are available free online or at the trail sites.
At the launch of The Muslim Cemetery Walk, Hussain along with the Everyday Muslim team also unveiled a blue plaque to recognise the historic Muhammadan Cemetery as Britain's first Muslim burial site and the oldest Muslim ‘space' in the country.
Hussain is a Fellow at the Centre of Religion and Heritage at the University of Groningen.
Teaching
During his teaching career, Hussain has taught English in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and Sociology and Media Studies in London and the Sydney Russell School in Essex, England.
Awards and nominations
In June 2016, Hussain's documentary America's Mosques won an award for the World's Best Religious Program at the New York Festivals (NYFF) Radio Programs Awards. In November, it was also shortlisted for the Radio Creative Feature award at the Association for International Broadcasters Awards.
In 2020, Hussain's guide to Saudi Arabia for Lonely Planet's Oman, UAE and Arabian Peninsula travel guidebook was a finalist in the Best Guide, Book, Online and App category at the Travel Media Awards.
In 2021, Hussain's book Minarets in the Mountains: A Journey into Muslim Europe was longlisted for the Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction.
Personal life
Hussain lives with his wife Tamara and three daughters in London.

Ilha de Boipeba () is an island in the Cairu municipality in Brazil, near the Ilha de Tinharé and part of the Cairu Archipelago. It is surrounded on the east by the Atlantic Ocean and on the west by the Rio de l'Enfer estuary.
It is a popular tourist destination due to its scenic beaches and rainforest, which makes up the majority of the island's economy along with fishing.
The island covers 88 square kilometers and had a population of 3,256 in 2010. There are four villages: Velha Boipeba, São Sebastião, Moreré, and Monte Alegre. Its beaches are Praia da Boca da Barra, Praia de Tassimirim, Praia da Cueira, Praia de Moreré, Praia de Bainema, Praia da Cova da Onça, and Praia da Ponta dos Castelhanos.
Ilha de Boipeba was first settled in 1537 by Jesuits from Portugal, making it one of the oldest settled places in the state of Bahia. The Church of Divino Espírito Santo, built in 1610, is its most important monument.
The name Boipeba comes from the word "M'boi pewa" (literally "flat snake") in the Tupi language, the native name for the sea turtle.

Fannett is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Jefferson County, Texas, United States. The population was 2,363 at the 2020 census. It is about southwest of Beaumont and is part of the Beaumont–Port Arthur metropolitan area.
The community is named after B. J. Fannett, a local landowner who opened a general store there in the 1890s. When Japanese immigrants brought rice farming to the area, Fannett grew to meet the farmers' needs.
Although oil has been discovered near Fannett, the town's population has remained small.
In 1993 and again in 2004, Fannett was the center of a controversy over the naming of Jap Road (now Boondocks Road). The road had been named in the early 20th century to honor immigrant rice farmer Yoshio Mayumi. However, the meaning of the word "Jap" had changed over time, transforming an honor into an ethnic slur.
Fannett is home to the Clifton Steamboat Museum, which features a large exhibit on Lieutenant Commander Harry Brinkley Bass (after whom the United States Navy destroyer was named).
Demographics
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 2,363 people, 871 households, and 588 families residing in the CDP.
Education
In 1961, the Fannett Independent School District was combined with that of neighboring Hamshire, forming the Hamshire-Fannett Independent School District.
Hamshire-Fannett ISD is assigned to Galveston College in Galveston.

The establishment and evolution of Kolkata Municipal Corporation followed a long process starting from around the middle of the 19th century. The Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 and certain steps taken thereafter saw the addition of peripheral areas in the eastern and southern parts of the city to the corporation area. In 1888, there were 75 commissioners, 50 of whom were elected, 15 appointed by the government and 10 nominated from bodies like Chambers of Commerce, Trades Associations and the Port Commissioners. The Calcutta Municipal Act of 1923 brought about important changes. The adjacent municipalities of Cossipore, Chitpore, Manicktola and Garden Reach, as well as the New Dock Extension area, were amalgamated with Kolkata. Garden Reach was later taken out.
Post-independence developments saw the introduction of adult franchise in municipal elections in 1962. The number of wards increased from 75 to 100. Tollygunge was merged with Kolkata in 1953. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act 1980, which came into effect in 1984, extended the boundaries of Kolkata by including South Suburban, Garden Reach and Jadavpur municipalities in Kolkata.

Abba Pitirim of Porphyry () was an Egyptian Christian monastic and saint of the fourth century, and a disciple of Anthony the Great. His feast day is November 29 in the Orthodox Church.
Life
Pitirim was an abbot of many monks, was the third successor of Anthony the Great in his hermitage, and was said to have received Anthony's virtues. He lived on Mount Porphyry () in the Thebaid, which was probably named after its proximity to the Roman quarry of Mons Porphyrites that mined a rare stone by the same name.
Pitirim continued the work of Anthony by instructing Christian monks along the Nile in the Thebaid, and lived with his followers in austere asceticism. It was said of Pitirim that he only ate water mixed with a little bit of flour twice a week, and that sometimes he would fast from food entirely.
Pitirim passed away peacefully in the late fourth or early fifth century.
Meeting with Isidora
A story of Pitirim is related in chapter 34 of Palladius' Lausaic History (written 419-420). According to Palladius, Pitirim one day received a vision from an angel while praying in the mountains.Now an angel appeared to the holy Pitirim, an anchorite of high reputation who dwelt in Porphyrites, and said to him: "Why are you proud of yourself for being religious and dwelling in a place like this? Do you want to see a woman who is more religious than you?"The angel told him to visit the monastery at Tabennisi (founded by Pachomius the Great), and there to find a woman who was more holy than himself. Pitirim did so and met Isidora, a woman of extreme humility among her fellow nuns. Pitirim admonished the other nuns for treating Isidora unkindly.They were all amazed and said to him: "Father, do not let her insult you, she is dumb." Said Pitirim to them all: "You are dumb. For she is am Amma both of me and you."
Verses
Troparion on Tone 8
Ode 6
Hymn of Praise
From the Prologue of Ohrid by Saint Nikolaj Velimirović.
Teachings
Pitirim taught that to each person's passions there are corresponding demons which incite that passion in the person through different [[. To escape from these demons and from evil thoughts, one must first free the heart from passions.
Monks often told Pitirim of visions of demons appearing to them. He would say, "I am most afraid of demons, which nest pride, avarice, sensuality and other similar passions. These are the most dangerous demons and great care must be taken towards them."

Vanloo lived in Paris as a child and was attracted to the theatre. As a young student he began writing plays and opéra comique libretti, notably with Eugène Leterrier who remained his main collaborator until the latter's death in 1884. He also worked with the writers William Busnach, Henri Chivot and Georges Duval.

Mollisol is a soil type which has deep, high organic matter, nutrient-enriched surface soil (a horizon), typically between 60 and 80 cm in depth. This fertile surface horizon, called a mollic epipedon, is the defining diagnostic feature of Mollisols. Mollic epipedons are created by long-term addition of organic materials derived from plant roots and typically have soft, granular soil structure.
Mollisols also occur in savannahs and mountain valleys (such as Central Asia, and the North American Great Plains). These environments have historically been strongly influenced by fire and abundant pedoturbation from organisms such as ants and earthworms. It was estimated that in 2003, only 14 to 26 percent of grassland ecosystems still remained in a relatively natural state (that is, they were not used for agriculture due to the fertility of the horizon). Globally, they represent ~7% of ice-free land area. As the world's agriculturally most productive soil order, the Mollisols represent one of the most economically important soil orders.
Though most other soil orders known today were formed at the beginning of the Carboniferous Ice Age 280 million years ago, Mollisols are best known from the paleopedological record as early as the Eocene. Their development is very closely associated with cooling and drying of the global climate that occurred during the Oligocene, Miocene and Pliocene.
Suborders
Albolls—wet soils; aquic soil moisture regime with an eluvial horizon
Aquolls—wet soils; aquic soil moisture regime
Cryolls—cold climate; frigid or cryic soil temperature regime
Gelolls—very cold climate; mean annual soil temperature < 0 °C
Rendolls—lime parent material
Udolls—humid climate; udic moisture regime
Ustolls—subhumid climate; ustic moisture regime
Xerolls—Mediterranean climate; xeric moisture regime
Soils which are mostly similar to Mollisols but contain either continuous or discontinuous permafrost, consequently affected by cryoturbation are common in high mountain plateaus of Tibet and the Andean altiplano. Such soils are called Molliturbels or Mollorthels and provide the best grazing land in such cold climates because they are not acidic like many other soils of very cold climates.
Other soils which have a mollic epipedon are classified as Vertisols because high shrink swell characteristics and relatively high clay contents dominate over the mollic epipedon. These soils are especially common in parts of South America in the Paraná River basin receiving abundant but erratic rainfall and extensive deposition of clay-rich minerals from the Andes. Mollic epipedons also occur in some Andisols but the andic properties take precedence.
In the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB), Mollisols are split up into Chernozems, Kastanozems and Phaeozems. Shallow or gravelly Mollisols may belong to the Leptosols. Many Aquolls are Gleysols, Stagnosols or Planosols. Mollisols with a natric horizon belong to the Solonetz.

The Bermuda Flying School operated on Darrell's Island from 1940 to 1942. It trained Bermudian volunteers as pilots for the Royal Air Force and the Fleet Air Arm.
During the First World War, roughly twenty Bermudians had entered the Royal Flying Corps and its successor, the Royal Air Force (RAF), as aviators and many others as groundcrew. Other than aircraft on visiting ships, there were no aircraft based in Bermuda 'til after the war, when returning military aviators, Majors Hal Kitchener (son of the late governor, Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Walter Kitchener, and nephew of Field Marshal Earl Kitchener) and Hemming, created a small company offering local flights in seaplanes operating from Hinson's Island. In 1936, Imperial Airways built an air station on Darrell's Island. This operated as a staging point on scheduled trans-Atlantic flights by flying boats of Imperial Airways and Pan American. At the time, no land planes could operate from Bermuda, there being no airfields.
With the start of the Second World War, the RAF in Bermuda took over Darrell's Island for use by RAF Transport Command and RAF Ferry Command.
Although the Royal Navy had a dockyard in Bermuda (which included an air station, RNAS Boaz Island (HMS Malabar) for flying boats), and Canadian and American naval and airbases would be established during the war, the only local units were the part-time army units, the Bermuda Militia Artillery (BMA), Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps (BVRC), Bermuda Volunteer Engineers (BVE), the Bermuda Militia Infantry (BMI), and Home Guard. These, along with a regular army detachment of infantry at Prospect Camp, formed the Bermuda Garrison, tasked with defending the various facilities of importance to the war effort. Although a contingent from the BVRC, with attachments from the other units, was sent to join the Lincolnshire Regiment in England in 1940, no further drafts were allowed to be sent for fear of weakening the defences. By 1943, this was no longer a concern and the moratorium was lifted.
It was decided to create a flying school on Darrell's Island to train local pilots for the Air Ministry in Britain, which would assign them to the RAF or the Fleet Air Arm. The school was in operation by the summer of 1940. It operated a pair of Luscombe seaplanes, paid for by an American resident of Bermuda, Mr Bertram Work, and a Canadian, Mr Duncan MacMartin. The school was under the command of Major Cecil Montgomery-Moore, DFC, who had served as a fighter pilot during the First World War. Between the wars, he had returned to Bermuda and became the Commanding Officer of the BVE, a position he would maintain throughout the Second World War. The chief flying instructor was an American, Captain Ed Stafford. The first class, of eighteen students, was in training by May 1940. On 4 June, Fenton Trimmingham became the first student to solo. Ten Bermudian companies agreed in June 1940, to defray the expenses of ten of the students. Those companies were the Bank of Bermuda, the Bank of N.T. Butterfield, Trimmingham Bros., H.A. & E. Smith, Gosling Bros., Pearman Watlington & Company, the Bermuda Electric Light Company (BELCO), Bermuda Fire & Marine Insurance Company, the Bermuda Telephone Company (TELCO), and Edmund Gibbons.
The BFS only accepted applicants who were already serving in one of the part-time units, which had been mobilised for the duration of the war. Successful students were released from their units and allowed to proceed overseas. With the moratorium against sending drafts overseas, this meant local soldiers came to see the BFS as the easiest way of reaching sharper ends of the war. Although the local units were allowed to send drafts overseas in 1943, the preceding state of affairs meant that a disproportionately high number of aviators appears on the list of Bermuda's war dead (ten out of thirty-five). In fact, the first Bermudian killed in the war was Flying Officer Grant Ede, DFC, a fighter pilot killed in the Battle of Norway in 1940 (although Ede had joined the RAF in England before the war).
By 1942, the Air Ministry had a glut of trained pilots. This had resulted from the fear created by the Blitz, and the Battle of Britain, when the RAF had assumed pre-eminence in Britain's defence against a feared Axis invasion. Desperate for pilots, too many had been allowed to train, or had been placed on backlists to await slots for induction and training. This would continue to be a problem as late as 1944, when the British Army was forced to disband a division after Operation Overlord due to a shortage of manpower. At the same time, the Air Ministry had the equivalent of a division of civilians waiting aircrew training slots, and already had more aircrew than it had aircraft available for them to man. This would lead to pilots being transferred to the Army's Glider Pilot Regiment, and to the lists of civilians reserved for aircrew training being cleared of men who were then able to be conscripted by the Army.
In Bermuda, the excess of pilots meant that the BFS was advised in 1942 that no further pilots were required. By then, eighty pilots had been sent to the RAF and Fleet Air Arm. THE BFS was included in the Empire Air Training Scheme. Its graduates included eight Americans, who had volunteered for the RAF in the US, and had then been sent to the BFS for training.
Although the school was closed, Bertram Work and Major Montgomery-Moore oversaw the conversion of its administration into a recruiting arm, the Bermuda Flying Committee, for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), sending sixty aircrew candidates to that service before the War's end. Sixteen Bermudian women were also sent to the RCAF to perform roles including Air Traffic Controller.
Flying instructor Captain Stafford moved to RAF Transport Command, and was later shot down, becoming a prisoner-of-war in Germany. He was piloting a Catalina on a flight from Darrell's Island to Largs in Scotland, on 7 April 1943. Nearing Britain, the crew were advised by radio to divert to RAF Mountbatten, near Plymouth, due to bad weather. Evidently due to a navigational error, they found themselves over occupied France and were shot down near Landéda, Brittany, by anti-aircraft artillery and two Luftwaffe fighters. The first officer was killed outright, and the navigator wounded. Stafford succeeded in landing the aeroplane two miles offshore, still under fire. Three, including Stafford, were pulled from the water by French fisherman. The bodies of two other crewmen washed up two days later, and the third three weeks later. As a POW, Captain Stafford headed a team of Allied orderlies in a wing of the Hohemark hospital, in Hesse, which was dedicated to the care of Prisoners of War from the Dulag Luft POW Camp in Oberusel (which was to become Camp King of the United States Army after the war).
The two Luscombe aircraft remained at Darrell's Island, being used by the RAF as station hacks. After the war they were used by the short-lived Bermuda Flying Club, created by returning pilots.

Mount Holt is a mountain rising to about at the terminus of Palestrina Glacier, Lazarev Bay, on Alexander Island, Antarctica. It is situated 9.2 km southeast of Piyanets Ridge, 19.2 km south-southwest of Mount Pontida and 7.4 km northwest of Galerius Peak. The mountain was photographed from the air by the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition, 1947–48, and was mapped from the photos by D. Searle of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey in 1960. It was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for Commander Fred C. Holt, U.S. Navy, Commanding Officer of Squadron VXE-6 during Operation Deep Freeze in 1976, and an LC-130 aircraft commander in 1975.
Commander Holt died peacefully at his Columbus GA home, surrounded by his family, on 26 OCT 2020. Acute kidney failure was the cause of death.
Fair winds and following seas, Commander.

Down with the Ship is the first extended play from xLooking Forwardx. Facedown Records released the EP on June 19, 2012.
Critical reception
Awarding the EP three stars from HM Magazine, David Stagg writes, "I think that's a good place for a old-school hardcore band testing the waters with a new EP." Michael Weaver, giving the album four and a half stars for Jesus Freak Hideout, states, "they are still legitimate after twelve years." Rating the album four stars at Jesus Freak Hideout, Scott Fryberger describes, "If you've been a fan of the band or you like hardcore punk in general, you'll love Down With The Ship". Steven Cosand, awarding the album four stars by Indie Vision Music, says, "Some might argue that Down With The Ship doesn't do anything to challenge the current wave of trends in hardcore."

Guidance Patrol (; ) is a 2012 Iranian comedy film directed by Saeed Soheili. The movie depicts three urban working poor young men who impersonate crew of a Guidance Patrol to earn money.
Dealing with a national issue, the movie soon sparked controversy in Iran and eventually was pulled from screens.
Ahmad Khatami called it "obscene" and "immoral" in Tehran's friday prayer speech. Ansar-e Hezbollah protested outside the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance building and set a 48-hour deadline for suspending the screening of the movie. Islamic Propagation Organization's Art Center, one of main proprietors of movie theatres in Iran, refused to screen the movie in its all 62 cinemas in order to "observe its duties in the protection of social and ideological values" because the movie "targeted Islamic morality and family decency".
Though it was only able to screen in 15 movie theatres, it enjoyed a strong opening and became the box office number-one for Nowruz before getting banned after 31 days. Surpassed by Kolah Ghermezi and Bache Naneh and I Feel Sleepy, it became the third highest-grossing film screened in Iran in 1391 SH.
Sequel
Saeed Soheili made two sequels for this movie, Guidance Patrol 2 and Guidance Patrol 3 in 2017 and 2020.

Electronic Arrays, Inc. was a United States integrated circuit (IC) manufacturer of the 1960s and 70s. The company originated when Jim McMullen and other employees of General Microelectronics left to form McMullen Associates, which was later renamed Electronic Arrays, Inc. in 1967.
They were best known for their series of electronic calculator chipsets, starting in 1970 with the EAS100 four-function calculator. Implemented in six chips, rapid improvements in semiconductor fabrication allowed them to progressively combine them in versions with five, four, two and finally a single chip. Although the EAS series was successful for a time, other vendors with more advanced processes entered the market and introduced single-chip systems before Electronic Arrays' own versions. They lost market share to companies like Mostek and Texas Instruments, and later to a slew of Japanese companies entering the market, including Hitachi, NEC, and Toshiba.
The company attempted to change markets with the Electronic Arrays 9002, an 8-bit NMOS logic microprocessor released in 1976. The company struggled with production issues and gave up marketing the design in November 1977. The company was sold to NEC in 1978.

Linslade is a town in the Central Bedfordshire unitary authority area of Bedfordshire, England. It borders the town of Leighton Buzzard, with which it forms the civil parish of Leighton-Linslade (where the 2011 Census population was included). Linslade was transferred from Buckinghamshire in 1965. Before then, it was a separate urban district. It remained a part of the Diocese of Oxford until 2008 when it joined Leighton Buzzard in the Diocese of St Albans.
Etymology
The name Linslade is Anglo Saxon in origin, and may mean "river crossing near a spring". (Though other plausible meanings exist.) The original form, recorded—for example—in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of 966, was Hlincgelad; then linchlade, pronounced lince-lade but by the time of the Domesday Book, in 1086, it had become Lincelada. The name continued to evolve, e.g. Lynchelade, in 1396, first appearing in its modern form in the 16th or 17th century, but with variations continuing into the 19th century.
History
Old Linslade
The earliest records of Linslade are of an Anglo-Saxon Manor, at the site of present-day Old Linslade, in 975 belonging to "Azelina", Ralph Tailbois' wife. The original Anglo-Saxon settlement of Linslade—prominent during the 13th century—was not located at the modern site, but was further north. It later became the hamlet of Old Linslade, superseding the original location of the 1840s. This transpired after massive growth associated with the construction of the Grand Union Canal and—particularly—the London and Birmingham Railway (now known as the West Coast Main Line). Linslade underwent a second major period of expansion, again associated with the railways, during the 1970s.
After the 1066 Norman Conquest, the manor was taken over by the de Beauchamp family. In 1251 a royal charter was granted to William de Beauchamp to hold a weekly market in Linslade, as well as a yearly 8-day fair. This grant was made on account of a Holy Well or Spring, located to the north of the village, which was a site of major pilgrimage. The holy well, which was a fabricated miracle to bring souls to the shrinking congregation of Old Linslade, was where the canal is sited today not far from the church.
In 1299, however, Oliver Sutton, Bishop of Lincoln, warned pilgrims off by threatening those who did not desist with excommunication. His reason for this is either that the well was unconsecrated or that the miracles being attested to happen at the well were in fact fraudulent. The vicar of Linslade—who did not dissuade the pilgrimages from visiting the spring because of the offerings they made—was forced to appear at the bishop's court.
Without the pilgrims, the importance of Linslade declined. But in the 15th century, the original 12th-century church, dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, was rebuilt.
Chelsea New Town
A second settlement—known as Chelsea New Town—began growing to south of the original Linslade on the Buckinghamshire-side of the crossing into Leighton Buzzard.
At the beginning of the 19th century the parish population was 203, but in
1805 the Grand Union Canal was opened on the Linslade-side of the River Ouzel, and in 1838 the London & North Western Railway built a railway line alongside the canal. This precipitated a rapid growth in population around the station, so that by 1840 the parish of Linslade had 869 residents. This prompted the vicar of Linslade, the Rev. B. Perkins, to set about fundraising for a school for the parish's poor, and a church for the New Town.
Fundraising for the church was only completed by the Rev. Perkin's successor, Rev. Peter Thomas Ouvry; and its completion in 1849 marks the point that the New Town had become Linslade.
Bideford Green
From the 1840s, Linslade grew steadily, although dipping during the Wars. But at the end of the 1960s a sustained period of development began which saw major housing estates added, so that by the end of the 1970s the town had over doubled in size.
Amenities
The expansion of Linslade during the 1970s added more amenities to the town. The principal Leighton-Linslade facilities within Linslade are Tiddenfoot Leisure Centre, which includes a swimming pool and indoor sports courts; Leighton Buzzard Golf Club and Leighton Buzzard railway station.
Commercial
Linslade has no high street. Small, family run shops are clustered at the "Centre of Linslade", where three arterial roads converge to cross the canal and river. Many of these buildings are Victorian in origin, as are all pubs, and the Hunt Hotel.
Education
Bedfordshire operates a three-tier education system, with Lower-, Middle and Upper Schools. Linslade has three Lower Schools (Linslade Lower, Southcott Lower, and Greenleas Lower) distributed relatively evenly across town; with a Middle School (Linslade School) and an Upper school (The Cedars) located opposite each other, on the edge of town.
Catchment areas for the Leighton-Linslade mean that some Linslade children attend Middle School in Leighton Buzzard and some Leighton children attend Upper School in Linslade, adding to traffic problems.

Community facilities
The 1970s expansion added one community centre on Bideford Green, run by a Residents Association; this includes a small bar. This can be hired out for public use, and is used for dance lessons and martial arts, as well as a polling station. Dance classes can also be taken at another community centre – the Forster Institute; and the Leanne Hughes dance school next to the station. Linslade Parish Hall (St Barnabas' Church Hall – a school until 1961) is used by many Leighton-Linslade organisations, including Tai Chi groups. Nyamba Scout Hut is home to 1st Linslade Scouts and Guides, as well as playgroups.
Parks and playgrounds
Linslade has two play areas and parks at Mentmore Road on the way to Cedars School and St Barnabas opposite the railway station.
Linslade has two semi-wild park areas. Linslade Wood (colloquially called Bluebell Wood) is a mature woodland dating back to at least the 16th century. Tiddenfoot Pit, a former quarry, turned into a lake and wildlife area. Both are managed by Greensands Trust.
Stockgrove Country Park and Rushmere Country Park are nearby.
Sport
As well as being home to several junior football teams, Linslade is represented at senior level by local 5-a-side team, Sporting Linslade. Sporting Linslade are the current Division 3 champions, their only domestic trophy to date. Sporting Linslade were chosen as the 5-a-side team of the year in the national Carling One-All Awards 2009.
Notable inhabitants

The album's 3,000 copies that were pressed were only sold in Australia, making it very valuable – and only available – on the second hand market. The album was released with the Every Day single on some pressings. This is the band's only studio album to feature Chris Mileski on drums.
Pre-release
The band entered the Triple J Unearthed band competition in 2000 with a demo of their song, "Nothing Really Matters", and went on to co-win the Sydney-region along with Blue and Ariels.Spans.Earth. which led to a management deal with Paul Stepanek Management. This deal enabled the band to release the full album of Welcome to the Real World. Along with "Nothing Really Matters", two other singles were released before the full album was made available; "Every Day" and "Rock Kids".
Music videos
Two music videos were produced for this album, the first being for the demo version of "Nothing Really Matters", which was released in 2000, and the other being for "Every Day", which was released with the album.
The music video for "Nothing Really Matters" is composed of live footage from 2000 of the band playing in Sydney. The music video for "Every Day", on the other hand, shows the band playing in an old hallway, with cuts to the band members dressed in different occupational attires such as a clown, an astronaut, a boxer and a policeman, with other shots of them dressed in straight jackets.
U.S. Release
Welcome to the Real World was released in the United States in early 2016. With no official word from the band, the record was added to the Apple Music iTunes store. Single releases for Rock Kids and Every Day also appeared for purchase. This came after the departure of vocalist/guitarist Shimon Moore and on the heel of their record, Fury, with new vocalist Bryan Scott.
Track listing
Outtakes
The album was initially supposed to feature a humorous cover version of Destiny's Child's hit single "Say My Name", characterized by turntable samples and heavy Flea-esque bass lines. The song "Brain Stew" by Green Day is used as background music. The cover contains additional lyrics with coarse language; for example, the chorus invariably ends with "You're acting kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby/So what the fuck?". The song, however, was not included due to the threat of a lawsuit by Destiny's Child's record label. The cover was later leaked on the internet and is regularly played at Sick Puppies' concerts.

Aminetou Mint El-Moctar (born 13 December 1956) is a Mauritainian politician and women's rights activist. She was shortlisted for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2015 and is the first Mauritanian woman to be considered for the award.
Early life
El-Moctar was born in Nouakchott on 13 December 1956 and grew up in an upper-class family of eight children. At the age of eleven, her father arranged marriage for her, which she strongly objected to, however the marriage went ahead and her first child was born when she was 14.
As a teenager she was involved with Marxist protests and was arrested several times by police. At this point, she also stood up for the rights of her family's slaves, encouraging them to take their own freedom and to leave. After leaving her husband, and unable to attend school, she worked in a variety of low-paid jobs, including: cigarette seller, switchboard operator, and as a social worker.
Activism & Feminism
El-Moctar's activism was formed early - standing up for the rights of others from a young age. Activism, speaking out against the government, especially by women, is unpopular with the authorities in Mauritania. IN 1974 she set up the Association of Mauritanian Women Democrats. Between 1989 and 1991 she was a member of The International Democratic Movement to Defend the Oppressed. In 1991 El-Moctar was arrested and tortured because she spoke out against the massacre of black minority Mauritanians in Nouadhibou. Her involvement led to the creation of the Committee on Solidarity with the Victims of Repression in Mauritania. She has lobbied for a quota in government for the involvement of women in political decision-making - it stands at 20% in 2019.
In 2009 she spearheaded protests against the sex trafficking of young women to the Arabian Peninsula. She has spoken out against the early marriage of girls and especially the cultural practice of force-feeding young women to become fat ready for marriage, leading to obesity and diabetes. In order to further the cause of human rights she states that: "We need to continue to raise taboo issues in order to break them, to make people aware of their rights and duties and, above all, to denounce all inhuman, degrading and discriminatory practices towards people, especially women and children". El-Moctar considers herself a feminist and wants to encourage women from across Africa to come together in the fights against male domination.
Fatwa
In 2014, a fatwa was launched against her by the imam of a Mauritanian radical Islamist movement, who call themselves Ahbab Errassoul (The Prophet's Friends). The order was issued against El-Moctar because she's publicly defending a blogger who was accused by Ahbab Errassoul of apostasy. The fatwa called for the killing and gouging out of El-Moctar's eye, simply because she demanded a fair trial for the blogger.
The Association of Women Heads of Households
On 17 April 1999, El-Moctar founded The Association of Women Heads of Households (AFCF, ), which she chairs. From its outset, the AFCF has been designed to reflect the diversity of Mauritania, including Arab, Berber, Haratin, Pulaar, Soninke and Wolof women. The AFCF has 12,000 members, six rescue centres for victims, 168 social workers, four lawyers and a contact person in every city in Mauritania. In 2019, the AFCF proposed new legislation to the Mauritanian government to defend women rights, in particular to introduce harsher sentences for rape. The proposal was rejected by the Mauritanian government as it did not comply with Sharia law.
Awards and honours
El-Moctar was awarded the Human Rights Prize of the French Republic in 2006. In 2010 she was awarded the Legion d'Honneur for her work in defending human rights in Mauritania. In 2015, El-Moctar was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, along with other anti-slavery campaigners Biram Dah Abeid and .

Paul Gautsch Freiherr von Frankenthurn (26 February 1851 – 20 April 1918) was an Austrian statesman who served three times as Minister-President of Cisleithania.
Biography
Paul Gautsch was born in Döbling (a Vienna suburb incorporated in 1892), the son of a civil servant. He attended the elite Theresianum boarding school and, having obtained his Matura degree, went on to study law at the University of Vienna. Gautsch achieved the promotio sub auspiciis Praesidentis, the highest possible honor for the country's best students, and began his career as a government official in the Austrian Ministry of Education.
In 1881 Gautsch became head teacher of the Theresianum school. On 5 November 1885 Emperor Franz Joseph I appointed him Minister of Education in the second cabinet of Minister-President Eduard Taaffe, an office he held until the downfall of Taaffe's government in 1893. Ennobled to the rank of Freiherr in 1890, he again served as Minister of Education in the Cisleithanian government of Kasimir Felix Badeni from 1895 to 1897.
After Badeni's resignation amidst the national crisis of the German-Czech language conflict, Gautsch was appointed Minister-President on 30 November 1897. He delayed the convening of the Imperial Council parliament, declared a state of emergency in Prague, and largely ruled by emergency decrees. His attempts to resolve the conflict by attenuating the language ordinances made by Badeni finally failed and Gautsch resigned on 5 March 1898, after only three months in office. The Badeni ordinances were finally revoked under Minister-President Manfred von Clary-Aldringen in October 1899, nevertheless the language dispute remained insuperable.
After his resignation, Gautsch served as president of the Austrian supreme audit institution (Oberster Rechnungshof) until on 1 January 1905 he was again appointed Minister-President. However, his second term in office too did not last long; preparing the way for universal male suffrage he met with resistance in the Austrian parliament and again resigned 1 May 1906. It was Minister-President Max Wladimir von Beck who could implement the electoral reform in December.
Gautsch returned to the Court of Auditors, until he was named Minister-President for the third time on 28 June 1911, again in troubled times when upon the Cisleithanian legislative election the government of his predecessor Richard von Bienerth-Schmerling had lost its majority in parliament. After violent rioting in Vienna as a result of high prices in September followed by shots in parliament, Gautsch resigned his office on November 3. He was succeeded by Karl von Stürgkh, who held the office for almost five years, leading Austria-Hungary into World War I.
Gautsch remained politically active as a peer of the Austrian Herrenhaus and confidant of the Emperor. He died in Spring 1918, a few months before the dissolution of the Monarchy.
In 1908, the SS Baron Gautsch passenger ship of the Austrian Lloyd had been named in his honour; the vessel sank in the first days of the Great War on 13 August 1914, when it hit a mine field laid by the Austro-Hungarian Navy near the Istrian coast. 147 people lost their lives in the sinking.

Curiosities
Kazuki Kitamura and Kenichi Endō have already performed together in 2014 in The Raid 2, as well as Yakuzas: Kenichi Endō as Hideaki Goto, head of Goto Family, a powerful yakuza family from Japan and one of two mob bosses that control Jakarta and Kazuki Kitamura as Ryuichi, the main Goto lieutenant and interpreter.
Yuko Oshima, the protagonist of this drama, is a former member from AKB48, one of the biggest groups of J-pop and Japan.
Before Isao Tachibana, Kenichi Endō had already been portrayed/interpreted two notorious fictional yakuza bosses in previous films: Joji Yazaki in Crows Zero and Crows Zero 2 and Hideaki Goto in The Raid 2: Berandal. In the first two films, he is the main antagonist, and in The Raid 2 he is a kind of anti-hero / anti-villain.
Actors with previous experiences in productions involving Yakuza: Kazuki Kitamura (Dead or Alive (film), Like a Dragon and The Raid 2), Ryo Katsuji (Crows Explode), Tetsushi Tanaka (Get Up! and Outrage Beyond), and Kenichi Endō (Like a Dragon, Crows Zero, Crows Zero 2, The Raid 2: Berandal, Dead or Alive 2: Birds and more).
It is possible that Senichi Mizuta, one of the bosses of the Yakuza and one of characters of this series is Zainichi Korean, mainly because he is interpreted by a Korean Zainichi, Kim Sung-Rak. With that it is quite possible that he was inspired by Machii Hisayuki, "The Ginza Tiger" and founder of Toa-kai or Tokutaro Takayama, one of bosses of Aizukotetsu-kai.

Frans Van Damme (1858 – 1925) was a Belgian painter.
Biography
Frans Van Damme was born in Hamme on 19 July 1858. He is best known for his work as a marine painter. Until the age of 12 he attended primary school in Sint-Niklaas. He lived in Waasmunster in his youth. At the age of 27, in 1885, he became Professor at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, and in 1887 at the Royal Academy in Brussels. He won the Prix de Rome and was awarded gold medals in Tunis, Paris and Saint Petersburg, whose Hermitage Museum owns two of his works.
Van Damme was a virtuoso and his work in keeping with the 19th-century tradition of Impressionist realism. He may be compared to Louis Artan. Within this emerging tradition he was nonetheless able to develop his own style. He had several residences and his work is very scattered. His life had a tragic end: his studio in Zeebrugge was destroyed by a bombardment in 1914. He was held captive for a year and came out of the war ruined. He died in Brussels on 30 April 1925.

NOAAS Reuben Lasker is a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) fishery research vessel. The ship's namesake, Reuben Lasker, was a fisheries biologist who served with the Southwest Fisheries Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, and taught at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. This class of NOAA ships is very similar to, and based in part upon, the Neil Armstrong-class Oceanographic Research (AGOR) ships owned by the Office of Naval Research and operated by various US Universities.
Construction and commissioning
Reuben Laskers construction was funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
Marinette Marine Corporation was awarded a $73.6 million contract to build her in April 2010. Reuben Lasker was laid down at the Marinette Marine Corporation shipyard in Marinette, Wisconsin, on 21 June 2011 and by February 2012 was 60% complete. Four months later, on 16 June 2012, Pamela A. Lasker, Reuben Lasker's daughter, christened the ship and Reuben Lasker was side-launched into the Menominee River. Marinette Marine delivered the ship to NOAA at Norfolk, Virginia, on 8 November 2013.
After a 20-day, 5,000-nautical mile (9,260-km) voyage from Norfolk via the Panama Canal, Reuben Lasker arrived at San Diego, California, her home port, on 29 March 2014. NOAA officially commissioned her on 2 May 2014 during a ceremony at the Navy Pier in downtown San Diego, California.
Characteristics and capabilities
Capable of conducting multidisciplinary oceanographic operations in support of biological, chemical, and physical process studies, Reuben Lasker was commissioned as the fifth of a class of five of the most advanced fisheries research vessels in the world, with a unique capability to conduct both fishing and oceanographic research. She is a stern trawler with fishing capabilities similar to those of commercial fishing vessels. She is rigged for longlining and trap fishing and can conduct trawling operations to depths of 3,500 meters (11,483 feet). Her most advanced feature is the incorporation of United States Navy-type acoustic quieting technology to enable NOAA scientists to monitor fish populations without the ships noise altering the behavior of the fish, including advanced quieting features incorporated into her machinery, equipment, and propeller. Her oceanographic hydrophones are mounted on a retractable centerboard, or drop keel, that lowers scientific transducers away from the region of hull-generated flow noise, enhancing the quality of the data collected. To take full advantage of these advanced data-gathering capabilities, she has the Scientific Sonar System, which can accurately measure the biomass of fish in a survey area. She also has an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler with which to collect data on ocean currents and a multibeam sonar system that provides information on the content of the water column and on the type and topography of the seafloor while she is underway, and she can gather hydrographic data at any speed up to 11 knots (20 km/hr).
Reuben Lasker has a traction-type oceanographic winch with a maximum pull weight of 30,000 pounds (13,608 kg) which can deploy up to 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) of 17.3-mm (0..681-inch) electromechanical cable. She also has two CTD winches with a maximum pull weight of 7,700 pounds (3,493 kg), each of which can deploy 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) of 9.5-mm (.375-inch) electromechanical cable, two trawl winches with a maximum pull weight of 50,000 pounds (22,680 kg), each of which can deploy 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) of 25.4-mm (1-inch) wire, and a net sonde winch with a maximum pull weight of 8,100 pounds (3,674 kg) which can deploy 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) of 11.4-mm (.450-inch) electromechanical wire. She has a 65-foot (19.8-meter) telescopic boom with a lifting capacity of 1,000 pounds (454 kg) at full extension and of 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) when extended 23 feet (7 meters) and a 23-foot (7-meter) telescopic boom with a 1,000-pound (454 kg) lifting capacity. She has a movable A-frame on her starboard side with a maximum safe working load of 2,000 pounds (907 kg) and a large A-frame aft with a maximum safe working load of 8,000 pounds (3,629 kg) that serves as a stern gantry. The oceanographic winch and large after A-frame work in conjunction to serve her stern sampling station, while two winches work with the starboard-side A-frame to service her side sampling station, and Reuben Laskers configuration allows her to have three scientific packages ready for sequential operations. One of her winches also can deploy lines and equipment over her stern. In addition to trawling, her sampling stations can deploy smaller sampling nets, longlines, and fish traps. Her winches can deploy CTD instruments to measure the electrical conductivity, temperature, and chlorophyll fluorescence of seawater. Reuben Lasker also can deploy specialized gear such as Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS) frames, towed vehicles, dredges, and bottom corers, and she can deploy and recover both floating and bottom-moored sensor arrays. While trawling, Reuben Lasker uses wireless and hard-wired systems to monitor the shape of the trawl net and to work in conjunction with an autotrawl system that sets trawl depth and trawl wire tension and adjusts the net configuration.
Reuben Lasker has a 630-square-foot (sq. ft.) (58.5-square-meter) (m²) wet laboratory, a 300-sq.-ft. (27.9-m²) dry laboratory, a 287-sq.-ft. (26.7-m²) biology and chemistry laboratory, a 445-sq.-ft. (41.3-m²) electronics and computer laboratory, and an 85-sq.-ft. (7.9-m²) hydrographic laboratory. She also has a 57-sq.-ft. (5.3-m²) climate-controlled space, a walk-in scientific freezer, a 360-sq.-ft. (33.4-m²) staging bay, and a 134-sq.ft. (12.4-m²) scientific ready room. She has open deck space aft for fishing and scientific operations and another area of open deck space at the side sampling station on her starboard side. All of her discharge pipes empty off her port side so that fluids discharged will not contaminate samples collected at the station on her starboard side. She has an ice-strengthened hull for operations in polar waters.
Reuben Lasker carries two 26.4-foot (8-meter) rigid-hulled inflatable boats (RHIBs), each with a 270-horsepower (201-kilowatt) motor and a capacity of 18 people, and a SOLAS-approved 15.5-foot (4.7-meter) rescue boat with a 32-horsepower (23.9-kilowatt) motor and a capacity of six people.
In addition to her crew of 24, Reuben Lasker can accommodate up to 15 scientists.
Service history
Officially classified as a "fisheries survey vessel," Reuben Lasker replaced NOAAS David Starr Jordan (R 444), decommissioned in 2010 after over 44 years of service and the last NOAA ship based at San Diego. Like David Starr Jordan before her, Reuben Lasker operates in support of the Southwest Fisheries Science Center in La Jolla, California – a component of NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service – and primarily conducts surveys of fish, marine mammals, and sea turtles off the United States West Coast and in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. Her commissioning in 2014 freed the NOAA fisheries survey vessel NOAAS Bell M. Shimada (R 227) from these duties, freeing Bell M. Shimada to focus on other high-priority projects – including studies of the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem and of salmon populations all along the U.S. West Coast – that prior to Reuben Laskers arrival had been allocated no dedicated sea time.

Marian Różański was born on 2 July 1864 in Padniewo, Kingdom of Prussia, German Confederation. In 1908 he moved to Rybnik.
He was co-organizer of the First Silesian Uprising in 1919. After the fail of the uprising, he got beaten and arrested by Germany, being imprisoned in Nysa, Free State of Prussia. In 1919, he had established the office of the Polish Red Cross. He was a manager of the Polish Plebiscite Committee, which in 1921 had handled the Upper Silesia plebiscite. After the plebiscite, when Rybnik was transferred to Poland, Różański had become a member of the Citizen Council, the provisional government of Rybnik.
He was awarded the Knight's (1923) and Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, Cross on the Silesian Band of Bravery and Merit, Star of Upper Silesia and Silesian Uprising Cross.

Ayetoro Gbede (Ayetoro-Gbede) is a town along the Ilorin – Kabba federal highway in Ijumu, a kingdom and local government area in Kogi state, Nigeria. Ayetoro Gbede is located in central Nigeria, approximately 420 kilometers northeast of Lagos, while it is 315 kilometers away from Abuja, the nation's capital. It is 21 kilometers away from Kabba Town. It is in the Kogi west senatorial district and Kabba/Ijumu federal constituency. The town was established over ninety-one years ago. The inhabitants of the town speak their local dialect of Okun and Gbede, which is a Yoruba dialect. The current traditional ruler is Oba Sunday Ehindero.
The first house in Ayetoro Gbede was built beside the old market and was owned by the founder, Oba Ajileye Daniel Alaa Bello. Ayetoro is also blessed with cashew seed, cocoa, vegetables, palm wine, and farming influence. The first community high school in Ayetoro gbede was established in September of 1979.
History
Ayetoro-Gbede was founded in 1927 by Oba Ajileye Daniel Alaa Bello who ruled as the first Oba from 1927 until his death on March 27 1964. Oba Alaa was a Christian and as such, used his influence with the missionaries to found the first church in Ayetoro-Gbede - Church Mission(ary) Society (CMS), where he was the Baba Ijo (Church Patron). Oba Alaa founded the town and persuaded many of the smaller neighboring Gbede settlements to join so they could create a bigger town with better economic opportunities and more effective protection from Slave Raiders (a practice that was prevalent at the time). The town consists of 10 communities and is believed to be the largest in the Ijumu Local Government Area of Kogi State.
Unlike many other Okun-Yoruba speaking communities, Ayetoro is one of the few towns with no known traditional festivities or deities being worshipped by the people. This is most likely due to its Christian origins.

"Dolerme" () is a song by Spanish singer and songwriter Rosalía. It was released through Sony and Columbia Records on 24 March 2020. The song release was supported by a lyric video which shows a cartoon picture of the singer and her pet chihuahua lying in a blue bedroom.
Background
The song was a surprise-release with no previous announcement by Rosalía. Instead, the singer took to Instagram to explain that she was in self-isolation due to COVID-19 at the time of the release and that she had lost track of time. She was hoping to make people feel better with the song, the same way making music supports her own mental health. Before the coronavirus pandemic, Rosalía was scheduled to release a "very aggressive and powerful single" alongside an American artist in March but ended up releasing "Dolerme" because she fell it matched more her current mood and the worlds', she told El Hormiguero. The song has not had any radio impact so it must not be classified as a single. Rosalía is spending quarantine in her manager's house in Miami since she was recording her new album when flights to Europe from the US and vice versa where banned on March 13.
Composition
The song was described as a "mid-tempo ballad" dealing with a "heartbreak", which, being "built on that guitar and keyboard loops, is distinctly pop as well, though Rosalía applies her flamenco tendencies". Lyrically, the track talks about "a fiery on-again, off-again relationship" which is not "helping this whole "isolated" thing", according to Vulture writer Zoe Haylock.
Critical reception
Patrick Johnson of Hypebeast thought that the song "finds Rosalía gracefully searching for balance between her traditional Flamenco roots with a modern, pop-infused vibe" while her vocals are characterized by "faint auto-tune with echoing layers". Suzette Fernandez at Billboard labeled it a "stark departure from her previous material" with Rosalía proving "herself to be a chameleon".

The Bengal Tenancy Act 1885 was an enactment of the Bengal government that defined the rights of zamindars lords and their tenants in response to a widespread peasant revolt.
Background
Eighteenth century
The Permanent settlement of 1793 gave absolute rights to the zamindars, who were hereditary landholders and ruled as such, but the rights of tenants were not defined. With time, in the nineteenth century, the land demand increased and the lords increased rents and land revenues. The Raiyots (tenants) refused to accept the zamindari rent increase beyond the customary rates.
This time period also saw a rise in the lesser-landed nobility (Chowdhurys and Taluqdars), whose existence did not fall under the Permanent Settlement laws. The Madhyasvatvas, as they were called (literally Subinfeudation), received their rights by purchase, and not by inheritance like the lords. The government tried to accommodate this class by enacting the Rent Act in 1859. But the issues remained.
Nineteenth century
Uprisings such as that in Pabna caused great problems. The Rent Commission of the Bengal Legislative Council, therefore, enacted the third Act of 1885.

The men's 85 kilograms weightlifting event was the fifth men's event at the weightlifting competition, limiting competitors to a maximum of 85 kilograms of body mass. The whole competition took place on August 15, but was divided in two parts due to the number of competitors. Group B weightlifters competed at 10:00, and Group A, at 19:00. This event was the seventh Weightlifting event to conclude.
Each lifter performed in both the snatch and clean and jerk lifts, with the final score being the sum of the lifter's best result in each. The athlete received three attempts in each of the two lifts; the score for the lift was the heaviest weight successfully lifted.
Tie-breaking rules determined the winner. Andrei Rybakou of Belarus it seemed set a world record. He lost out in the gold medal as Lu Yong of China tied this but weighed in slightly lighter – and per Olympic rules, the lighter lifter won. The record rules first meant the earliest lifter's mark counted as to record entries, but Rybakou's world (and Olympic) records were later annulled due to doping.

Jordi Garcia Fernàndez (born 22 November 1963, Barcelona) is a biologist whose research focuses on how the novelties present in the key evolutionary transitions arouse during metazoan evolution. He is the current vice-rector of research at the University of Barcelona, and a Honorary Research Professor at the University of Oxford.
Life and career
After finishing his grade studies, in 1992 he published his doctoral thesis under the supervision of Emili Saló i Boix in the University of Barcelona. Then he moved to Oxford for his Postdoctoral research to the lab of Peter Holland. In 1998, he published his research about the ParaHox gene cluster in a Nature paper with Peter Holland and Nina Brooke.
In the year 2000, Jordi Garcia refused leading the European amphioxus genome project due to the poor state of research in Spain. In 2003 he obtained the position of full professor of genetics and in 2007 he was awarded the Honorary Research Professor of Merton College position (Oxford). After being elected as Head of Genetics Department in the University of Barcelona in 2015 and (after the departments fusion) of the Genetics, Microbiology and Statistics Department of the University of Barcelona in 2016, he became vice-rector of research of the University of Barcelona after the team led by Joan Guardia won the elections in December 2020. Alongside his career he has stablished long-term (national and international) collaborations such as with Peter Holland (Oxford), Manuel Irimia (Barcelona), Hector Escrivá (Banyuls-sur-mer) o Jaime Carvajal (Sevilla).

Ruth Harriet Bleier (1923–1988) was a neurophysiologist who is also one of the first feminist scholars to explore how gender biases have shaped biology. Her career consisted of combining her academic interests with her commitment to social justice for women and the lower-class.
Early life and education
Bleier was born in New Kensington, Pennsylvania on November 17, 1923. She was also the daughter of Russian immigrants and was raised in New Kensington, Pennsylvania. She received her B.A. from Goucher College in 1945, and subsequently received her M.D. from Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1949. She married Leon Eisenberg, and together they raised 2 children and ran a medical clinic for the impoverished population of Baltimore.
Career
Medicine and Scholarship
Following medical school, Bleier interned at the Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland and then practiced general medicine in the inner city of Baltimore for ten years. Due to her lack of cooperation when subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAAC), she was placed on the HUAAC blacklist resulting in Bleier losing her hospital privileges. Bleier gave up her medical practice in order to teach psychiatry and physiology at the Adolph Meyer Laboratory of Neuroanatomy. Since she lost her legal ability to practice medicine, Bleier went to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1957 to study neuroanatomy with Professor Jerzy Rose, completing her post-doctoral fellowship in 1961. She then joined the University of Wisconsin-Madison department of Neurophysiology in 1967; at the same time Bleier was also working with Weisman Center of Mental Retardation and the Wisconsin Regional Primate Center. As a result of her neuroanatomy work, Bleier is a known authority on the animal hypothalamus.
In the 1970s, Bleier began to see how the biological sciences were affected by sexism and other cultural biases, and thus devoted herself to the application of feminist analyses and viewpoint to the practices and theories of science. Bleier helped establish the Woman's Studies Program at the University of Wisconsin in 1975, and served as chair from 1982 to 1986. She also began to focus on improving women's access and station in higher education. Bleier argued against the idea of sociobiology as an explanation of conventional gender roles. In her work she demonstrated how gender, sexuality, and science, are constantly changing in response to social values and ideas rather than being static and judgment-free. She published work that brought together feminist theories and natural sciences: Science and Gender: A Critique of Biology and Its Theories on Women and Feminist Approaches to Science.
Activism and Advocacy
Bleier advocated for civil rights with the Maryland Committee for Peace in the early 1950s. She also advocated for the end of the Korean War; this work lead to the subpoena from HUAAC, which was run by Senator Joseph McCarthy at the time period. At the hearing, Bleier reported the Committee for Peace had no members and would not confirm that she was head of the committee.
Sticking to her activist routes, Bleier was a founding member of the Association of Faculty Women (AFW) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The Association challenged the administration to reassess the status and salaries of female instructors campus-wide and to rectify inequalities. The Association succeeded in equaling pay for men and women university workers and also succeeded in integrating gymnasiums by having the women faculty have a group shower in the men's locker room. Bleier was chair of the AFW when Title IX was signed in to law and was pivotal in achieving more equitable conditions for women's athletics at Wisconsin.
Publications
Bleier has published works detailing the anatomy of the cat, guinea pig, and rhesus monkey hypothalamuses. Her books regarding biology and feminism, Science and Gender: A Critique of Biology and Its Theories on Women (1984) and Feminist Approaches to Science (1986), have become prominent readings for women's studies to explore the biological differences of sexes and the origins of gender differences.
Personal life
Bleier came out as a lesbian after her marriage to her husband ended in divorce and began her work to create lesbian rights within the women's movement. She created a lesbian-friendly restaurant, called “Lysistrata.” She also organized lesbian social events, a feminist bookstore. Additionally, Bleier advocated for abortion rights with her partner, Elizabeth Karlin.
Death and legacy
Bleier died at home in Wisconsin on January 4, 1988 from cancer at sixty-four years old. The University of Wisconsin annually awards the Ruth Bleier scholarships in order to encourage young women to go into careers studying the natural sciences, medicine, or engineering, and the University of Wisconsin's Department of History of Medicine has an endowed chair in her honor.

Walter Jesse Jackson (16 March 1870 – 1 December 1958) was an English rugby union and professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1890s. He played representative level rugby union (RU) for the British Isles, and England, and at club level for Gloucester, and Halifax, as a forward, or wing, and club level rugby league (RL) for Halifax (Heritage No. 9), as a forward.
Rugby career
Jackson was born in Gloucester, Gloucestershire, and he died aged 88 in Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire.
Rugby career
Jackson first came to note as a rugby player while representing Gloucester. In 1891 Jackson accepted an invitation to join the British Isles on their tour to South Africa, the first official tour by the team that later became the British Lions. It is unknown if Jackson joined the tour party late, was unwell or just not chosen to play, but he missed the first four matches of the tour, not playing until the team faced Griqualand West at Kimberley on Monday 20 July 1891. From there he played in four of the next six games though missing the First Test against South Africa. His last match of the tour was against a King William's Town & District team, played on 6 August, despite there being a further 11 matches remaining.
On returning to Britain Jackson continued playing rugby, but between 1891 and 1894, switched from Gloucester to Halifax, who were at the time still a rugby union club. It was while representing Halifax that Jackson was selected for his one and only appearance for the England national team. Played away against Scotland, Jackson was brought into the England team for the last match of the 1894 Home Nations Championship, but after playing in the pack for the British Isles, was placed on the wing for England. The match ended in defeat for England, their first loss in five visits to Scotland; and the English selectors reacted by never selecting nine of the England players again, Jackson being one of them.
Rugby League
When Halifax converted from the rugby union to the rugby league code on Thursday 29 August 1895, Walter Jesse Jackson would have been approximately 25 years of age. Consequently, he became both a rugby union, and rugby league footballer for Halifax.

Hanuman Patal Vijay (, "Hanuman's Victory Over Hell") is a 1951 Hindi mythological film directed by Homi Wadia for his Basant Pictures banner. Meena Kumari starred in this devotional film with S. N. Tripathi playing Hanuman. Following her career as a child actress, Meena Kumari did heroine roles in mythologies made by Basant Pictures and directed by Homi Wadia. She had an extremely successful career for some years playing goddesses before her big commercial break in Baiju Bawra (1951). S. N. Tripathi, besides acting in the film, also composed the music. His costars were Meena Kumari, Mahipal, Niranjan Sharma, Dalpat and Amarnath.
The story was about Hanuman's devotion to Ram and his battle with the two demon brothers Ahiravan and Mahiravan.
Plot
The story is about Hanuman and his confrontations with The King of Patal, Ahiravan, and his brother Mahiravan, who have been asked by Ravan to kill Ram and Lakshman. Mahiravana kidnaps Naga princess chandrasena who is devoted to Rama. The film follows Hanuman's encounter with Makari, the daughter of the sea, who wants to marry him, but instead through the swallowing of a bead of his sweat she gives birth to Makardhwaj who guards the gates of Patal (Hell) where Ram and Lakshman are taken when kidnapped. Hanuman gets the better of Makardhwaj and rescues Ram and Lakshman. A major battle ensues and Ahiravan and Mahiravan are killed, but somehow they keep regenerating. Hanuman manages to find out the secret of their regeneration and puts a stop to it with the help of Ahiravan's wife Chandrasena. In the end, Rama tells Chandrasena that he will marry her in Dvapara Yuga when he will incarnate as Krishna and marry her as satyabhama.

Conspecific song preference is the ability songbirds require distinguishing conspecific song from heterospecific song in order for females to choose an appropriate mate, and for juvenile males to choose an appropriate song tutor during vocal learning. Researchers studying the swamp sparrow (Melospiza georgiana) have demonstrated that young birds are born with this ability, because juvenile males raised in acoustic isolation and tutored with artificial recordings choose to learn only songs that contain their own species' syllables. Studies conducted at later life stages indicate that conspecific song preference is further refined and strengthened throughout development as a function of social experience. The selective response properties of neurons in the songbird auditory pathway has been proposed as the mechanism responsible for both the innate and acquired components of this preference.
Neural mechanisms
The mechanism responsible for the ability to distinguish song types has not yet been fully characterized by researchers in the field of neuroethology, but it has been demonstrated that at least five different structures within the auditory pathway contain neurons that preferentially respond to conspecific song. The structure of neural networks, the morphology of neurons, and the receptor and ion channel complement of pre-synaptic connections cause some neurons to respond maximally to a particular stimulus frequency, phase, amplitude or temporal pattern, and this is known as spectral-temporal tuning. Tight spectral-temporal tuning in the auditory pathway provides the central nervous system of songbirds with the ability to discriminate between conspecific and heterospecific songs. Tuning characteristics of auditory neurons have been best characterized in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), canary (Serinus canaria), European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) and barn owl (Tyto alba).
Learning and motor pathways
The conventional song system of songbirds has two parts: the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) involved in song learning, and the posterior forebrain pathway or "song motor pathway" (PFP/SMP) involved in song production. Both of these descending pathways contain neurons that are responsive to conspecific song. Female Canaries lost the ability to discriminate between conspecific and heterospecific song after bilateral lesions to the high vocal center HVC, a nucleus that sits at the apex of both pathways. In males, however, most song system neurons respond maximally to the sound of the bird's own song, even more than they do to the tutor's song or any other conspecific song. In HVC, neurons switch from responding best to tutor song (35–69 days post-hatch) to responding best to the bird's own song (>70 days post-hatch). Song preferences of neurons in these pathways are important for sensorimotor learning, however several lines of evidence suggest that the specific ability to discriminate conspecific from heterospecific song does not reside in the AFP or the SMP. Most importantly, gene expression studies have demonstrated that, as a broad unit, neurons in the AFP and SMP show increased activation when a bird is singing, but not when it is simply listening to song. With the exception of female Canaries, the neural substrate for conspecific song preference is thought to reside outside the conventional song system, in the auditory pathway.
Auditory pathway
Cochlea
Avian hair cells have been extensively studied in the cochlea of the barn owl, and it is now known that both the morphological structure of hair cell papillae and the ion channels that characterize hair cell membranes confer spectral tuning properties. Ca2+ dependent K+ channels are produced as splice variants of the cSlo gene, and different isoforms cause the hair cell to preferentially respond to different resonant frequencies. Species-specific differences in cSlo isoforms of hair cell membranes may therefore play a role in the discrimination of conspecific and heterospecific notes in songbirds.
Auditory thalamus
Studies on zebra finch have shown that nuclei in the auditory thalamus, two steps up from the cochlea, do not passively relay input from peripheral sensory structures into higher forebrain structures. Thalamic nuclei show different patterns of gene expression in response to different stimuli, implicating them in the process of acoustic discrimination. Neurons in the nucleus ovoidalis (Ov) have receptive fields that are tuned to respond to the specific combination of spectral and temporal features present in syllables of conspecific song. Stimulus-selective tuning is determined by the receptor proteins and ion channels characterizing synapses of these neurons. Neurons can selectively respond to time-based differences between songs (e.g. syllable length or syllable-interval length) if they are post-synaptic to either fast-release (ionotropic) or slow-release (metabotropic) glutamate receptors.
Auditory forebrain
Strong conspecific-selective responses have been most consistently demonstrated in neurons of the higher-level structures of the auditory system: The caudomedial neostriatum (NCM), the auditory thalamo-recipient subfield (Field L: L1, L2a, L2b, L3), and the caudal mesopallium (CM: CMM and CLM). NCM and CM have been known to be discussed in conjunction with one another being as they are functionally similar. Recent studies have begun to show that while that is true, CM seems to respond in a manner relative to whether or not the stimulus is personally significant to the bird.
In European starlings, neurons in NCM habituate to a particular stimulus, and “remember” individual characteristics of songs to which a bird was exposed. This indicates that NCM functions in individual recognition, through the strategic recruitment of N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) to synapses that receive repeated patterns of excitation. In fact, NMDARs are thought to be the unit broadly responsible for synaptic memory in the central nervous system. NMDARs in NCM neurons, therefore, might be a compelling target for selection when song functions in discrimination among conspecific songs, for neighbor recognition and territorial defense, but NCM is unlikely to play a role in the discrimination of conspecific from heterospecific songs.
In male zebra finches, neurons in Field L and CM do not exhibit a preference for different types of conspecific songs (in contrast to neurons in NCM, and those that participate in the AFP and SMP). Field L and CM neurons do not discriminate between the tutor song, the bird's own song, or individual conspecifics. Instead, they demonstrate a higher-order preference for conspecific song over heterospecific song or other types of sound. When male and female European starlings are trained to recognize conspecific song, there is an associated change in the response of CMM neurons, and female zebra finches experience a reduced ability to discriminate between conspecific and heterospecific song following lesions to the region. However, CMM neurons in females also show increased activation in response to their father's song over a novel conspecific song, demonstrating that this nucleus also participates in some selectivity among conspecific songs in females.
Neurons in both Field L and CM have sophisticated filter properties, selective for both the spectral-temporal modulations and phase relationships of conspecific songs. Furthermore, different neurons are selective for different features of syllables and songs. In Field L, neurons have one of four different tuning strategies—they are either tightly tuned a particular frequency, or they are sensitive to frequency edges, frequency sweeps or combined frequencies. When exposed to natural song as a stimulus, different ensembles of these of neurons respond to different components of sound, and together they demonstrate the ability to perform sensitive discrimination between conspecific and heterospecific syllable types. As in nucleus ovoidalis, the spectral-temporal filter properties of Field L and CM neurons are a function of the particular ion channels and receptor proteins driving their synaptic dynamics. The complex and sophisticated tuning of these higher order processing centers for conspecific sounds may rely on the integrated inputs from the entire ascending auditory pathway, from the hair cells through the thalamus and forebrain, but this challenging synthetic question remains to be investigated.
Evolutionary significance
In an evolutionary context, neural mechanisms of conspecific song preference in the auditory pathway are important for species recognition. Species recognition traits play a central role in both the origin and maintenance of reproductive isolation. Furthermore, a shared neural mechanism for conspecific song preference has implications for the coevolution of male song and female preference, which may help explain the dramatic diversity of song phenotypes in extant songbirds<.

China Forbes (born April 29, 1970) is an American singer and songwriter who has been the lead singer of the band Pink Martini since 1995.
Life and career
The daughter of Peggy (née Woodford) and Donald Cameron Forbes, China Forbes was born and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her father was of French and Scottish descent, and her mother is African-American. She attended Phillips Exeter Academy ('88), then studied visual arts at Harvard University, where she met Thomas Lauderdale, a classically trained pianist. They became friends and met regularly to play music together. At Harvard, she won the Jonathan Levy Prize for acting.
After graduating in 1992, Forbes worked as an actress for several years, performing Off-Broadway in New York City. She then became a musician, forming a band and recording a solo album. She sang the song "Ordinary Girl" for the television series Clueless and "Que Sera Sera" over the credits for the movie In the Cut. While living in Portland, Oregon, Lauderdale asked her to sing with Pink Martini, a band he had assembled to play at political fundraisers. After three years commuting from New York, she moved to Portland in 1998 to work full-time with the band. Forbes and Lauderdale co-wrote the band's hit "Sympathique (Je ne Veux Pas Travailler)" among many other band originals.
Apart from her work with Pink Martini, she has released solo albums, including Love Handle (November 1995) and 78 (Heinz 2008) which includes her song "Hey Eugene" in its original version. She is featured on Michael Feinstein's album The Sinatra Project, singing a duet of "How Long Will It Last?". She recorded two songs in French with Georges Moustaki for his album Solitaire.
She is a cousin of former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and indie-rock musician Ed Droste of Grizzly Bear. Her sister is Maya Forbes, a screenwriter and director.

Walery Łoziński (15 January 1837 - 30 January 1861) was a Polish writer and publicist.
Biography
Łoziński was born into a lowly noble family, his father Walerian working as postmaster and mandate administrator. He was the brother of Władysław, a historian and journalist, and the cousin of Karol Szajnocha, a historian, and Polish independence activist.
His family moved from Mikołajów to Smolnica near Sambir, which inspired his later pseudonym Walenty from Smolnica. He attended a gymnasium in Sambir, where he first started writing, and it was there that he finished his first, never published novel titled Kamień w Spasie. He was expelled from school in 1855 with a wolf ticket for his patriotic activity. Not wanting to be a financial burden to his parents, he moved to Lviv where his cousin, Karol Szajnocha, took him in and found him a job in the official editorial office of the Lviv Gazette where he furthered his writing career.
His novels appeared as periodical episodes in Lviv newspapers. Łoziński's work often commented on national issues, and maintained a patriotic tone; he also strongly criticised and ridiculed Austria, and for this reason his works were subjected to strict censorship.
He often integrated historical elements into his novels, often referring to the bloody events of the Galician massacre in 1846 and the Spring of Nations in 1948.
His most well known work was The Enchanted Mansion (1859), which is considered to be the first Polish gothic style adventure novel.
Death
Łoziński was known for his bellicose inclinations, his love of quarrels, and from a certain point - of duels. On January 10, 1861, Łoziński entered a saber duel with Karol Cieszewski - a well-known and popular journalist from Lviv, his editorial colleague. The disagreement was over a woman, also working in the editorial office Aniela Przyłęcka. Łoziński was wounded in the temple and died less than three weeks later as a result of post-traumatic meningitis and blood poisoning (an old wound from the previous duel with Jan Dobrzański got reinfected). The writer, heavily indebted, was buried at the city's expense. His funeral, which took place on February 2, became a great patriotic demonstration attended by the entire Polish intelligentsia of Lviv.

Sinna was a Roman era civitas of the Roman province of Africa Proconsularis.
This ancient city is tentatively identified with ruins at Calaat-Es-Senan in modern Tunisia.
The ancient town was also the seat of a Christian bishopric (in Latin Rite Sinnensis) suffragan of the Archdiocese of Carthage. The only bishop known of this diocese is Victor, who attended the Council of Constantinople in 553. Sinna survives today as a titular bishopric. Its current bishop is Arūnas Poniškaitis of Vilnius.

Janusz Boleslaw Pawliszyn (born May 16, 1954) is a Polish chemist. He is a Canada Research Chair at the University of Waterloo and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Industrial Research Chair in New Analytical Methods and Technologies.
Early life and education
Pawliszyn was born on May 16, 1954, in Gdańsk, Poland. Pawliszyn began his education in Poland by attending the Gdańsk University of Technology for his Bachelor of Science degree in engineering and Master's degree in bioorganic chemistry. Following this, he moved to the United States for his PhD in analytical chemistry at Southern Illinois University.
Career
Following his PhD, Pawliszyn joined the faculty at Utah State University where he attempted to get funding for research on polymer-coated optical fibers that could extract both volatile and nonvolatile analytes from complex media in the liquid or gas phase. After failing to secure funding from United States-based funding agencies, he left Utah to join the University of Waterloo with support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council. Through this support, he invented the Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technique which "uses a solid coating on a sample probe to selectively extract chemical substances from blood, saliva, urine, and even plasma. After a simple washing step, the probe can then be placed in front of the mass spectrometer for analysis." As such, the SPME technique began to be used in a large range of chromatographic methods, including environmental, forensic, bioanalytical, as well as clinical studies. Chemist Daniel W. Armstrong later stated that SPME "revolutionized many areas of sampling and analysis."
As a result of his discovery, Pawliszyn was appointed the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Industrial Research Chair in New Analytical Methods and Technologies. He also earned numerous honours including the 1995 McBryde Medal, the 1996 Tswett Medal, the 1996 Hyphenated Techniques in Chromatography Award, the 1996 Caledon Award, and the 1998 Jubilee Medal from the Chromatographic Society. Following the September 11 attacks, SPME was used to test for toxins in the air at Ground Zero at the World Trade Center. In 2008, Pawliszyn was honoured for his invention of SPME with the EnCana Principal Award as someone who has made a significant impact in the world outside the lab. He also earned the American Chemical Society's Separations Science and Technology Award.
In March 2010, Pawliszyn was promoted to the rank of University Professor of Chemistry at the University of Waterloo. A few months later, he was recognized for "innovation leadership" as part of the Ontario Premier's Innovation Awards for 2010. Through the same year, Pawliszyn was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada for "developing state-of-the-art, integrated and automated analytical methods and instruments for on-site analysis and monitoring of living and environmental systems." Upon becoming a fellow, Pawliszyn received the 2011 Dal Nogare award from the Chromatography Forum of Delaware Valley as a scientist who has made a significant contribution in the field of chromatography. The following year, Pawliszyn was honoured by the Canadian Society for Chemistry with the 2012 E.W.R. Steacie Award as a scientist who has made a "distinguished contribution to chemistry while working in Canada."
In 2019, Pawliszyn was ranked the 9th most influential person in analytical science across the globe by Analytical Scientist. He also received the 2019 Talanta Medal for his numerous contributions to analytical chemistry and for his pioneering work in SPME.

Dysphania militaris is a species of moth of the family Geometridae that is found from in the tropical regions of South and Southeast Asian countries such as China, India, Myanmar, Andaman Islands, Sumatra and Java. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae.
Description
Its wingspan is about 80–96 mm. Forewings of male produced, long and narrow. The fovea strongly developed. Head, thorax and abdomen golden yellowish with purplish bands. Forewings with golden-yellow basal half, the outer half deep purplish with its inner edge irregularly sinuous. Two oblique basal purple fasciae, where the lower fascia sometimes having a spot detached from it. Two spots found on costa near base. There is an oblique antemedial series of three spots often conjoined. The outer area with two pale blue maculate bands, where the outer ending found at vein 3. Hindwings golden yellow, with a large purple discocellular spot and a spot below the cell. A postmedial lunulate band excurved between veins 3 and 5. A submarginal spot series becoming large conjoined lunulate patches at apex. The spots on the yellow area are very variable.
Ecology and recognition
It flies during the day and because of its bright colours it is often mistaken for a butterfly. Several similar species, including Dysphania subrepleta, occur in the region and some are very closely related. Dysphania alloides, which was described from the Andaman Islands, was originally considered a subspecies.
Larvae have been reported to feed on Carallia species, Kandelia candel and Rhodomyrtus tomentosa plants.

is a 3D eroge video game made by Illusion, released on April 21, 2006, in Japan. Compared to Illusion's previous games, the main story is shorter, it features an improved 3D engine and is mainly played through mouse control. The game centers on a male character who stalks and rapes a mother and her two daughters. Three years after its initial release, the game garnered international attention and controversy for its content, resulting in it being banned in several countries.
Gameplay
RapeLay is played from the perspective of a chikan named Masaya Kimura, who stalks and subsequently rapes the Kiryū family (a mother and her two daughters).
Plot
In Story Mode, the player controls a sex offender with a history of previous arrests. The protagonist sexually assaults two minors and an adult woman in the order of 12-year-old Manaka, 42-year-old Yūko, and 17-year-old Aoi. After the player finishes raping all three women, they unlock Free Play mode.
Aoi Kiryū catches Masaya Kimura groping a woman on a subway train, leading to his arrest by the authorities. The next morning, Aoi and her younger sister Manaka help their mother, Yūko, find a wallet she lost around their home while talking about Aoi's incident the previous day. Unknown to them, Kimura secretly eavesdrops on their conversation while waiting outside their house. It is revealed here that his father, a well-known influential politician, managed to release him from custody. When Kimura discovers that Yūko is widowed, he decides to exact revenge, starting with Manaka.
After following Manaka to the subway station, he gropes her on a train. Leaving the train at the next stop, he traps Manaka in a public bathroom, rapes her and takes photos of her naked, semen-covered body with his mobile phone. Masaya instructs Manaka to feign sickness and stay in her room the next day.
The following day, Masaya follows Yūko from her house to the subway before fondling her on a train. He then follows her to the city park. As instructed by Masaya, Manaka calls Yūko on her mobile phone, telling her that she is in the bushes at the park. When Yūko walks towards the bushes, Masaya ambushes her, ties her up, and rapes her. He takes photos as he did with Manaka previously, before handing her over to his gang of henchmen, who detain her for him.
On the third day, Masaya follows Aoi to the subway and shows her a picture of her tied-up mother. Shocked, she can only follow his orders as he gropes her on a train. After getting off the train, she asks Masaya the reasons for his actions, at which point she recognises him as the same man she reported for molesting a woman earlier. Getting in a vehicle, Masaya and his henchmen take Aoi to a hotel owned by his family. He violently rapes her in a mini-suite room and again photographs her after withdrawing.
After Masaya has had his way with Aoi, Yūko and Manaka are taken into the room via a secret door. With all three captured, Masaya reveals his plans to make them his sex slaves. Yūko tries to cover for her daughters and pleads with him to take her instead. He considers this and tells Yūko he might spare her daughters if she can prove her worth. Yūko gives him fellatio while her daughters watch. When Masaya seems pleased at her performance, Yūko thinks she has won her daughters' freedom. However, Masaya reveals that he will never change his mind and that they are all there to stay. Yūko breaks down in the end, Manaka breaks next and finally Aoi as well. The main story ends with an ominous title card stating that as a new day starts, the Kiryū family horror has just begun.
Endings
There are two possible endings. Regardless of the ending achieved, it results in Masaya's death.
Black Ending – Masaya impregnates either Manaka or Aoi or Yūko and decides to keep the child. A few days later, Masaya is at the subway when he falls onto the train tracks and is killed by a moving train.
Red Ending – If the cowgirl position is used with Aoi before she breaks, the game will show a cutscene of Aoi brandishing a knife and stabbing Masaya many times while hysterically laughing. The scene goes black and Aoi's voice is heard. The game ends with Aoi being questioned by the police for Masaya's murder.
Characters
– The player character of the game. A scion of an influential politician, Masaya becomes a chikan who stalks and subsequently rapes the Kiryū family after his release from prison. He lacks a voice actor, instead communicating exclusively through text before and after rape game sessions.
– the younger Kiryū sister at 12 years old. She has short black hair and wears a blue dress. The player can give her cat ears, which make her meow. Voiced by Natsumi Yanase (credited as "Izumi Maki").
– the older Kiryū sister at 17 years old. She has long brunette hair and wears a school uniform. The player may choose to have her hair in a ponytail (default setting) or down and free-flowing. Voiced by Mao Enokizu.
– the widowed mother of the two sisters. Yūko is a 42-year-old woman with short brown hair who wears a green top and a beige skirt. Yūko also has the largest breasts and the player can give her glasses to make her produce virgin/geek sound effects. Voiced by Akari Tomiyama (credited as "Kaori").
Controversy
Critics of violent imagery in video games, such as British Member of Parliament Keith Vaz, have cited games involving rape as an example of why video game content needs to be more strictly regulated. RapeLay in particular had come to Vaz's attention in 2009, three years after its initial release, as it was sold on Amazon.com, despite not being officially distributed nor supported outside of Japan, and he vowed to bring the issue into the British Parliament to prevent the game from being sold. Amazon subsequently removed the game from sale on its website. Equality Now urged activists to write to Illusion and then-Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso in protest, arguing the game breaches Japan's obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. In May 2009, these actions culminated in the restriction of the sale and production of RapeLay by the Ethics Organization of Computer Software (EOCS), an independent Japanese ratings organization for adult games, making it impossible to purchase the game even in Japan.
The distribution of RapeLay has been banned in Australia due to a campaign run by Women's Forum Australia, under the directorship of Melinda Tankard Reist. RapeLay is also the only video game to be effectively banned in Argentina. Citing RapeLay as an example, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, in his concurring opinion vis-à-vis the case Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association wrote, "It ... appears that there is no antisocial theme too base for some in the video-game industry to exploit."
Articles in defence have also been written, many noting that rape is considered a lesser crime than murder, yet there are thousands of legal video games in which the goal is to kill enemies. Illusion's response to the controversy was one of bewilderment and a reiteration that the game passed Japanese laws and was not sold outside Japan. Illusion later removed references to the game from their website and ceased distribution of the game, citing concerns over the impact on the industry.
As an immediate aftermath, several eroge publishers and studios began to ban foreigners from their official websites. Companies like Minori, Navel and VisualArts banned foreign IPs and chastised foreigners to move to Japan to play their games. In a controversial move, Minori also began to send cease and desist letters to translation groups and vandalized a translation wiki to enforce their ban. Users in the eroge community saw those acts as heavy-handed and xenophobic.

Vincent Carsten Maria Müller (born 23 August 2000) is a German professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for MSV Duisburg.
Career
Early career
After taking his first steps in youth football with local club SG Köln-Worringen, Cologne native Müller was accepted into the 1. FC Köln youth academy at the age of six.
Müller grew into first choice in goal in both the U17 and U19 teams of Die Geißböcke. With the U19 team, he finished third in the Under 19 Bundesliga West group in his final season and narrowly missed participation in the final round of the championship. That season he also appeared twice for the reserve team in the Regionalliga despite being a backup to Jan-Christoph Bartels and Brady Scott.
Würzburger Kickers
For the 2019–20 season, 19-year-old Müller signed a two-year contract with 3. Liga club Würzburger Kickers. From early-October onwards, Müller, originally planned as the third goalkeeper, replaced regular starter in goal Eric Verstappen, who had conceded 27 goals by then. Müller featured as a starter from then on and kept a clean sheet for four games, but broke his jaw on 2 June 2020 in a 0–1 home loss to 1. FC Magdeburg which sidelined him for two games. From 13 June and until the end of the season, Müller would continue as the starter in goal for the Kickers, keeping a clean sheet twice. Würzburger Kickers won promotion to the 2. Bundesliga at the end of the season.
PSV
After signing Fabian Giefer, who won the starting spot in goal in pre-season for Würzburg, Müller moved to Dutch Eredivisie club PSV in late-September 2020. There, he was united with German head coach Roger Schmidt and three other compatriots, including fellow goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall.
MSV Duisburg
Müller joined 3. Liga club MSV Duisburg on 21 June 2022, signing a two-year contract. He made his competitive debut for the club on the opening day of the 2022–23 season, playing the full game as his club lost 1–0 to VfL Osnabrück. On 21 August 2022, he scored the second goal in a 3–0 victory against SV Meppen, with a free-kick from his own half.

The 2013 season was the Baltimore Ravens' 18th in the National Football League (NFL) and their sixth under head coach John Harbaugh. The Ravens entered the season as the defending Super Bowl champions from the previous year, but failed to improve on their 10–6 record from 2012, and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2007 and for the first time in the Harbaugh/Flacco era. For the first time in franchise history, Ray Lewis was not on the roster, as he announced his retirement before the playoffs began the year prior. He retired as a champion of Super Bowl XLVII and was the last remaining player from the team's inaugural season. Lewis also helped the Ravens win Super Bowl XXXV over the New York Giants and is believed by many as the greatest Baltimore Raven of all time. Including Lewis, the team parted ways with a record eight starters from the Super Bowl-winning squad; no other defending Super Bowl champion had lost more than five.

Week 1: at Denver Broncos
NFL Kickoff game
Due to a conflict involving the Orioles' schedule, the Ravens opened the regular season on the road against the Broncos, the first time a defending Super Bowl champion team had done so since the Buccaneers in 2003 when they opened their regular season against the Eagles. This was being a rematch of the previous year's AFC Divisional game also known as the Mile High Miracle.
The Ravens drew first blood when Joe Flacco found Vonta Leach on a 2-yard touchdown pass to take the lead 7–0 in the first quarter for the only score of the period. The Broncos tied the game in the 2nd quarter with Peyton Manning finding Julius Thomas on a 24-yard pass to take the game to 7–7. The Ravens moved back into the lead when Ray Rice ran for a 1-yard touchdown to make the score 14–7. Peyton found Julius again on a 23-yard pass to make the score 14–14 for another tie before the Ravens kicker Justin Tucker nailed a 25-yard field goal to make the score 17–14 at halftime. In the 3rd quarter, the Broncos went right back to work as Peyton found Andre Caldwell on a 28-yard touchdown pass to take a 21–17 lead followed up with finding Wes Welker on 2 consecutive passes from 5 yards and 2 yards out for an increase in the lead first to 28–17 and then to 35–17. Later on in the quarter, Peyton found Demaryius Thomas on a 26-yard pass to increase the lead to 42–17. The Ravens tried to rally a comeback in the last quarter, with Flacco finding Marlon Brown on a 13-yard pass to shorten the Broncos' lead 42–24 followed up by Tucker's 30-yard field goal to make the score 42–27. However, the Broncos wrapped things up in the game when Peyton found D. Thomas again on a 78-yard pass to make the final score 49–27. The Ravens began their season 0–1 for the first time under John Harbaugh as head coach and Joe Flacco as their starter. They also lost their first regular season opening game since 2007 as well as becoming the 2nd straight defending Super Bowl champion team to lose their season opener.
Week 2: vs. Cleveland Browns
With their 11th straight win over the Browns, the Ravens improved to 1–1.
Week 3: vs. Houston Texans
Despite playing without star running back Ray Rice and a few other key starters, the Ravens were able to hold Houston to just 9 points, despite several trips on Baltimore's side of the field, including three red zone trips. With the win, the Ravens avenged their 30-point blowout last year to Houston, improved to 2–1 overall and 7–1 all time against the Texans, including playoffs.
Week 4: at Buffalo Bills
With the loss, the Ravens fell to 2–2.
Week 5: at Miami Dolphins
The Ravens won on the road for the first time in their 2013 season and improved to 3–2.
Week 6: vs. Green Bay Packers
With the loss, the Ravens fell to 3–3.
Week 7: at Pittsburgh Steelers
This was the first loss against the Steelers at Heinz Field since the 2010–11 NFL playoffs. With the loss, the Ravens headed into their bye week at 3–4.
Week 9: at Cleveland Browns
The Ravens lost their third straight game and fell to 3–5. It also snapped the team's 11-game winning streak over the Browns. Harbaugh and Flacco's records against the Browns dropped to 11–1.
Week 10: vs. Cincinnati Bengals
The Ravens were ahead 17–0 at half time, but the Bengals scored 17 unanswered points in the second half to force overtime.

However, about five minutes into overtime, Justin Tucker kicked the winning field goal (46 yards), and the Ravens improved to 4–5.
Week 11: at Chicago Bears
The game was interrupted in the first quarter for about two hours as a result of a torrential downpour at Soldier Field. After a slow start to the season, Ray Rice rushed for 131 yards and a touchdown. The Ravens were able to get the game to overtime, but the Bears won on a Robbie Gould field goal. The Ravens fell to 4–6.
Week 12: vs. New York Jets
The Ravens improved to 5–6.
Week 13: vs. Pittsburgh Steelers
Thanksgiving Day game
The Ravens won consecutive games for the first time since September and improved to 6–6. Additionally, they also improved to 2–0 in Thanksgiving Day games.
Controversy erupted in the third quarter when Steelers' head coach Mike Tomlin stood on the field along the his team's sideline as Jacoby Jones broke free on a kickoff return for a potential game breaking touchdown. Tomlin, with his back to the approaching play, appeared to glance over his shoulder then place his foot briefly onto the field as he jumped out of the way, causing Jones to veer inside where he was tackled. Several Ravens players claimed Tomlin had intentionally interfered with Jones; if officials had agreed, a touchdown could have been awarded to the Ravens based on the palpably unfair act. However, no penalty was called for interference or for standing in the white border area reserved for the officiating crew. On December 4, 2013, the NFL fined Tomlin $100,000.
Week 14: vs. Minnesota Vikings
In an eventful game, Vikings running back Adrian Peterson appeared to injure his ankle in the second quarter, and did not return to the game.

Week 16: vs. New England Patriots
With the loss, the Ravens fell to 8–7 and back to seventh place in the playoff hunt, enabling their division rivals Bengals to secure the AFC North title.
Week 17: at Cincinnati Bengals
With this defeat, the Ravens were eliminated from post-season contention, assuring the NFL of a new Super Bowl Champion for the ninth straight year. The Ravens finished the season with a record of 8–8. This was also the last NFL game for running back Ray Rice as he was indefinitely suspended by the NFL and released by Ravens the following season.

Teletouch is the trade name for the transmission controls found on many Edsel brand automobiles manufactured by the Edsel and Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln (M-E-L) Divisions of the Ford Motor Company. The significance of the Teletouch systems lies in its conception, design and symbolism for American automobiles produced in the 1950s, and the gadgets designed into them. The main distinguishing feature of the system was its use of push buttons on the steering wheel to shift gears as opposed to a gear stick.
Conception
Conception of the Edsel began in the early 1950s when Ford Motor Company attempted to outflank industry leader General Motors through altering its production, pricing and its make and model ranges. One of the results of this plan was the E-car program that resulted in the ill-fated Edsel.
From the beginning, the Edsel was promised to be something very different from the cars that Detroit was turning out at the time. However development costs required that Edsel share the basics of other established Ford brands on the market. In this climate, the Edsel emerged as a five-model, three-wheelbase automobile line. Senior Edsels would share their chassis with Mercury, junior models would share their chassis with Ford passenger vehicles, and station wagons would share their chassis and body structure with Ford's station range.
The distinction offered by the Edsel, therefore, was in the styling details. While the famed 'horse collar' grille and 'boomerang' tail lights made the Edsel visually unique, the Teletouch transmission and saucer-like spinning speedometer emerged as two of the better-remembered interior details.
Design
The first electrical gear shift mechanism sold on new automobiles was the Vulcan electric gear shift system, a solenoid-driven transmission shift device for a standard sliding gear gearbox introduced in the summer of 1913. Among the automakers to offer the Vulcan system were the Haynes Automobile Company of Kokomo, Indiana; the S.G.V. Company of Reading, Pennsylvania; and the Norwalk Motor Car Company of Martinsburg, West Virginia. While the Vulcan shifter was often advertised as standard equipment on the Haynes car, a common floor shift was also available for $200 less. Norwalk made the Vulcan system available on their products, such as the Underslung Six, as an option; approximately 25 of those cars were so equipped. A large nickel-plated box was attached to the right side of the steering column which housed the push button mechanism. It utilized six buttons – first through third gear, reverse, neutral and park. There was also a "signal" button which was the horn. A housing containing four large solenoids was mounted at the transmission which acted on the steel transmission shift control rods. The driver was free to select any gear at will, enabling the bypassing of gears, such as jumping from first to third gear without going through second gear. There was a cautionary advisory with the car that one must use care when placing the selector into reverse, only doing so when the car was completely stopped. Pushing a button on the shift control preselected the chosen gear. The electrical circuit was closed only after the driver fully depressed the clutch pedal. This energized the appropriate transmission mounted solenoids necessary for returning the transmission to neutral and then completing engagement of the preselected gear; the driver would then release the clutch pedal to continue onwards. These seemed to have been very advanced automotive systems. The Vulcan Electric Shift Company was located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and was eventually bought out by Cutler-Hammer. The model year 1914 was the only year that Norwalk used this system. Only one known Norwalk Motor Car survives today, which is owned by the friends of the Norwalk Foundation, Inc. in Martinsburg. Haynes was evidently the only automaker of note to place the push-buttons in the center of the steering wheel. The Vulcan electric gear shift system probably didn't survive past the early 1920s, since nothing regarding it has been found in the automotive engineering literature past 1921, and a 1919 Haynes print ad has been found with no mention of the electric shifting system.
Chrysler Corporation automobiles introduced pushbutton automatic transmission controls for their PowerFlite and Torqueflite transmissions for the 1956 model year. Instead of the traditional placement of a gear selector on the column, Chrysler's system mounted the gear buttons in dashboard pods to the left of the steering wheel, becoming the first U.S. carmaker to offer such a system. This system was mechanical. Packard also introduced a steering-column-mounted electro-mechanical pushbutton transmission control pod in its "Touch Button Ultramatic" in 1956, placed off to the right of the column about . Using technology that it purchased from a Packard supplier, Auto-Lite, this push-button system proved problematic as the electric motor was insufficient to move the car out of Park on a steep hill, and would pop the circuit breaker; electrical contact problems, wiring problems and other issues were prevalent even when new; and the problems worsened with age.
The Mercury Division of Ford Motor Company (later, in 1957, the Lincoln-Mercury Division), followed suit with its purely mechanical push-button transmission control system in 1957 called "Keyboard Control" then in 1958 it was revised and called "Multi-Drive".
When the 1958 Edsel launched in the late summer of 1957, the Edsel became the first and only Ford division to launch an electro-mechanical push-button transmission system, which it trademarked as Teletouch. Teletouch placed the transmission buttons in a ring within the center of the steering wheel. Edsel's marketing department promoted the Teletouch as a logical progression in the process of making the steering wheel the central command center for controlling cars. Marketing also pointed out that more of the dashboard view was unrestricted to the driver with the gear handle removed. Edsel even issued a Teletouch "face-mask" for dealers to wear and pass out as an advertising premium promoting the system to would-be buyers.
While a standard gear selector was available as a reduced-cost option for the automatic transmission on the Edsel Ranger, Pacer and station wagon models, Corsair and Citation models came standard with Teletouch.
Execution
In theory, the idea of the Teletouch system made sense, but in its execution, the system quickly became the bane of the Edsel and its owners. Many new car buyers, and most automotive writers, found Teletouch to be a gimmick, while others found it distracting or confusing. Despite its marketing talking points, it required the driver to remove a hand from the steering wheel rim to push a center-pod button.
Reliability proved poor due to the servo motor's hot, wet and dirty operating environment between the bell housing and the exhaust pipe just above the road surface, and the somewhat troublesome associated relays, switches, wiring and connectors. On the other hand, the wiring inside the steering column did not move and was extremely reliable, since the pod containing the buttons did not turn with the wheel. The electric control current flowed through a set of slip rings and brush contacts, while the Teletouch buttons were held in the correct position with Neutral at 12 o'clock through a set of planetary gears in the steering column. The steering wheel was directly coupled to the steering linkage as with conventional steering columns.
Eventually, all push-button transmission selectors became a safety issue due to lack of industry-wide standardization. In addition, since the 1920s the center of the steering wheel had typically held the horn button. While some cars of the late 50s had horn rings, some drivers instinctively hit the steering wheel center in an emergency, sometimes causing them to either damage the controls or cause an unexpected, hazardous gear change (occasionally causing transmission damage). The Edsel's system included an electro-hydraulic inhibitor switch activated by transmission fluid pressure which virtually eliminated the possibility of this happening.
The single circumstance under which a Teletouch could be put into gear with the car moving at greater than three to five miles per hour was if the neutral button was depressed first, thereby removing hydraulic pressure from the inhibitor switch, and then the reverse or park button pushed. These actions would, as a result, either shear off the parking pawl or suddenly set the rear wheels turning in the reverse direction, effectively locking them up against the road surface and possibly damaging the reverse bands in the transmission. Ironically, the failed Autolite Packard system protected against this set of circumstances by locking out not only reverse and park, but also neutral while the car was moving with any significant speed.
For the 1959 model year, Edsel dropped Teletouch as an option, and began the process of abandoning the automotive market by dropping its Mercury-based cars, and eliminating the Citation, and Pacer cars as well as the Bermuda and Roundup station wagons.
Steering wheel-mounted transmission controls have made a comeback since the mid-1990s introduction of Porsche's Tiptronic system, although the controls for the selection of park, reverse, and neutral are almost always located elsewhere. They also invariably have the buttons or "paddles" for the functions that are on the steering wheel quite near the rim, for true "both-hands-on-the-wheel" functionality.

Paul Merton's Secret Stations is a British travel documentary television series, first broadcast on 1 May 2016 on Channel 4. Presented by Paul Merton, the series focuses on some of the little used stations in Great Britain which operate as request stops. Reviews were largely positive but not overly so, focussing on both the subject matter and Merton's contribution to argue how the series elevated itself above other series in the genre.
Genesis
The series was one of a number of new commissions by More4 which focused on "traditional Britain" with series fronted by celebrities.
Synopsis
The series was inspired by travel writer Dixe Wills' 2014 book Tiny Stations, and Wills is interviewed in the first episode. The introduction to the series explains that the railway network of Great Britain has a total of 152 request stops, "tiny, out of the way stations", a relatively small total (around 6%) of the total number found on the network's of track. It argues that these are often the most overlooked stations in terms of travelogues, and so deserve to be visited to explore their secrets, many of which will be unknown as they are by definition, not on the tourist trail. Merton visits 17 stations (listed below), some of which are on the same line - and while most are in remote rural areas (by virtue of the fact that request stops are for little used stations), the series also includes some urban locations. During a visit, Merton covers both the history of the station, and of associated people or places.
Stations
As the first series ended, Dixe Wills writing in a piece for The Guardian said there were still more than enough interesting request stops to justify a second series, pointing to the examples of Bootle, Buckenham, Conwy, Dolgarrog, Dunrobin Castle, Llanfairpwll, Lympstone Commando, The Lakes and Penychain.
Production
The series was made by Brown Bob Productions Ltd for Channel 4, executive produced by Jacqueline Hewer, and directed by Ewen Thomson. The series makes extensive use of aerial filming.
Presenter
Although Merton is primarily known as a comedian and as a panelist on Have I Got News For You, he had also been presenting travel documentaries since 2007. In the introduction to the series he explains he "loves railways and everything about them", and that his fascination with rail travel stemmed from the fact his father was a train driver on the London Underground (Merton himself preferring journeys with a view). Despite his love of train travel, he stated he hadn't known about the concept of request stops until making the series. The spokespeople for the campaign group Friends of Reddish South Station, who featured in the series, praised Merton's level of knowledge and evident research into their campaign.
Broadcast
The series was first broadcast on Channel 4 in the 8pm-9pm slot on Sunday nights.
Episodes
Reception
According to Claire Webb of the Radio Times, Merton was "in his element pootling around railways with a flat cap and a boyish grin". Sam Wollaston of The Guardian, attracted to the series by Merton as opposed to love for travelogues, also observed that Merton pootles about, in the process producing a gentle but rather nice addition to the genre. Ben Arnold of the same paper stated that "Beneath a curiously niche premise....is a fairly standard, albeit charming, British travelogue show". Gerard O'Donovan of The Telegraph gave it three out of fives stars, arguing that Merton's role was obviously to wring out something worth saying from unpromising prospects, also observing that he tootled about, concluding that the outcome was worth a look, but was unlikely to become destination viewing. According to the Press Association it was the combination of the obscure subject matter and Merton's comedic style that elevated this series above the many similar celebrity presented travelogues before it, arguing also that it is Merton's sheer enthusiasm for the subject matter that makes it engaging viewing. Matt Baylis of the Daily Express was less enthused, claiming the show's content was not always that interesting and even missed out pertinent details, leading him to lament that the show had not been presented by the expert, Dixe Wills, who featured in episode 1.

Founding and early years
The channel's origins are traced as far back as 1959. Pedro Bonilla, owner of Radio HIN, expressed the will to launch a private television station and launches Rahintel (Radio HIN Televisión) on February 28, 1959 in a shop located near the grounds of the Fair of Peace and Fraternity of the Free World, which had recently opened at the time.
The initial purpose of the creator and, therefore, of the TV company in general were, initially, to contribute to the education of the population and to serve the economic and industrial sectors as a vehicle for promoting their products.
Artistically, Rahintel was a little more liberal in contrast to La Voz Dominicana (the current 4RD). However, this climate of artistic freedom that opened in Rahintel bothered Jose Arismendy Trujillo (Petan), director of La Voz Dominicana (and brother of tyrant Rafael Leonidas Trujillo). But Petán couldn't remove the plant - or even acquire it - given the links between Pepe Bonilla and Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Martinez (Ramfis).
Because of that, shows like "La hora del moro" (Hour of the Chow) were created, which opened the doors to many young artists who tested their talents. This program was run by the Dominican musician Rafael Solano and he gave the start of the careers of singers such as Nini Cáffaro.
At this time, coverage was limited to the capital and some nearby towns and their programming only ran from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM and, on rare occasions, until 11. In addition to live programs, its programming consisted of American series and comedies.
Growth and expansion
Several years later, in 1966, their coverage extended into the country via channels 7 and 11 and its signal was extended to the north and northwest. Notably, in the city of Santiago de los Caballeros, Rahintel operated on channel 11. However, they managed to create another frequency to transmit channel 7 in Santiago. This channel was known as Canal 7 Cibao.
During the decade, Rahintel made their first satellite transmission, becoming the first channel of the Dominican Republic to do it.
Golden Age
In 1983, Pedro Bonilla sold the TV station to Grupo Financiero Universal, controlled at the time by Leonel Almonte, who would expand the plant and their television programming, along with Milton Peláez, who launched offers to several shows on Color Visión. The episode of the "war of the ballots" had begun.
At the time, Rahintel won this "war" and managed to move several famous and competitive programs to the channel, having also included cartoons and anime like Force Five, Candy Candy, Thundercats, among others.
In the late 80s, Grupo Financiero Universal collapsed and several of their acquired artists and shows left the channel. However, Rahintel continued broadcasting normally, still airing animated shows with good ratings.
Decline, reboost and shutdown
In the early 90s, a program called "Sabadíssimo" was created and was led by José Guillermo Sued but was later removed from the schedule. Telenovelas like Mari Amor and shows like Mission: Impossible, Tarzan, MacGyver, Freddy's Nightmares and other popular shows like Nubeluz were also transmitted.
By the very end of the decade, Rahintel in decline. Still, ratings surprisingly increased with reruns of Candy Candy, and managed to obtain the rights to broadcast Tigres de Licey and Leones del Escogido matches for the 1998-1999 Dominican baseball season. These two teams came to compete for the championship that season and all occurrences of that final series were transmitted by channel 7. However, despite the transmission of the matches gave them an increase in ratings, their fate was sealed. After 40 years of operations, Rahintel silently shuts down in April 1999. The frequency was sold for a sum of $15.000.000 to Grupo Mercasid, who, in October, launched a new channel, Antena Latina.

One Good Friend is the third studio album by Canadian country music artist George Canyon. It is the first album released by Canyon since he competed on Nashville Star 2, and his first release in the United States. In 2005, the album won Canyon a Juno Award for Country Recording of the Year. The album was produced by Steve Mandile of the band Sixwire, who also wrote three of the songs on it, including a co-write with Andy Childs, another member of the band.
Fellow Canadian country musician Paul Brandt sings back-up for the track "Letting Go".
Content
The album's title comes from the track on the song that was pitched to George the day before he began recording. "I immediately thought of my wife Jennifer and had to have it on the album. She is my one good friend."
The album's most well known track, "My Name" co-written by Canyon, was written from the perspective of an unborn baby. "A close friend and his wife had a miscarriage and I witnessed the pain they went through losing a baby. I wanted to write a song to help people cope with that trauma and somehow bring a positive light to the subject." The music video for that song continues the theme.

The Fernleigh Track is a multi-use rail trail near Belmont in New South Wales. The track was constructed in the way of the former Belmont railway line. The project is a joint venture between Newcastle City Council and City of Lake Macquarie. The track extends from Adamstown to Belmont over an approximate distance of . The former railway closed in December 1991. The first section between Adamstown and Burwood Road opened in 2003. Construction has continued in stages with the final section between Jewells and Belmont completed in March 2011.
The abandoned Belmont railway line was a coal haulage and passenger rail line from Adamstown to Belmont. In 1880 a rail line was built to Redhead with the line being extended to Belmont in 1916. At one stage there was talk of extending the line to Swansea.
A feature of the conversion of the former railway to a multi-use trail is the retention of many industrial heritage features. The trail passes through the brick-lined Fernleigh Tunnel under the Pacific Highway.
At the site of the former Kahibah station, the cycleway is crossed by the Great North Walk, a walking trail connecting Newcastle and Sydney. The track also passes through the centre of the Glenrock Lagoon catchment.

Thinethavone "Tim" Soutphommasane ( ; born 1982) is an Australian academic, social commentator and former public servant. He was Australia's Race Discrimination Commissioner at the Australian Human Rights Commission from 2013 to 2018. He has previously been a political staffer for Bob Carr, a columnist with The Age and The Australian newspapers, a lecturer at Sydney and Monash Universities, and a research fellow with the Per Capita think tank. He is a member of the board of the National Australia Day Council, and an ex officio member of the Council for Multicultural Australia.
Early life
Soutphommasane was born in Montpellier, France in 1982 to Chinese and Lao parents who had fled Laos as refugees in 1975.
His family was resettled by the Family Reunion Program of the Australian Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to Sydney's south-western suburbs in 1985, where he was raised. He was educated at Hurlstone Agricultural High School.
Academia
Soutphommasane graduated from the University of Sydney with a first-class honours degree. He was then a Commonwealth Scholar and Jowett Senior Scholar at Balliol College of the University of Oxford where he completed a Master of Philosophy with distinction and a Doctor of Philosophy in political theory.
From 2010 to 2012 he was a Lecturer in Australian Studies and a Research Fellow at the National Centre for Australian Studies of Monash University. He was one of six chief investigators on an Australian Research Council Linkage project studying the history of ANZAC Day.
In 2019, he was appointed Professor of Practice in Sociology and Political Theory at the University of Sydney to teach human rights related theory.
Journalism
Soutphommasane was a regular writer for The Australian newspaper, to which he contributed feature articles and the Ask the Philosopher column each Saturday. He also wrote for The Monthly magazine. While living in England, Soutphommasane was a freelance journalist, contributing blog entries to The Guardian and The Financial Times, as well as opinion pieces and reviews to The Spectator, The Australian, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.
Writing
Soutphommasane's first book Reclaiming Patriotism: Nation-Building for Australian Progressives was published in 2009. Loosely based on research undertaken toward his doctoral thesis, the book argues that people with progressive politics must re-engage with ideas of patriotism and national identity, which Soutphommasane claims were surrendered to the right during the Prime Ministership of John Howard.
His The Virtuous Citizen: Patriotism in a Multicultural Society was published in 2012 and Don't Go Back To Where You Came From: Why Multiculturalism Works, published the next year, won the NSW Premier's Literary Award in the 'Community Relations Commission Award' section.
He was also co-editor (with Nick Dyrenfurth) of All That's Left: What Labor Should Stand For (New South Books, 2010).
Other roles
Soutphommasane was appointed to the Council for Multicultural Australia in August 2011.
Political activity
Soutphommasane joined the Australian Labor Party in 1998, aged 15. He later worked on the speechwriting staff of then New South Wales Premier Bob Carr, and in late 2007 he returned from Oxford to work as a research officer in the office of Kevin Rudd during that year's federal election campaign.

Edgar Paul Boyko (October 19, 1918 – January 1, 2002) was an Austrian-born Alaskan attorney. He served as Attorney General for the State of Alaska under the administration of Governor Walter Hickel from 1967 to 1968.
Biography
Edgar Boyko was born in Vienna, Austria, on October 19, 1918 to Myron David, an eye doctor, and Florence Boyko, an opera singer. He attended the University of Vienna, but after the German annexation of Austria in 1938, he moved to Scotland. Boyko completed a degree in chemistry at St. Andrews University where he married his high school girlfriend Blanka Kohn. In 1939, the couple emigrated to the United States, where Boyko worked several jobs before receiving a law degree from the University of Maryland in 1945.
Boyko moved to Alaska in 1952 to work as an attorney for the Bureau of Land Management. The next year, he entered private practice, eventually practicing law in both Alaska and California. He became known for mounting daring defenses in difficult cases, as well as for his theatrical and idiosyncratic style. Boyko said a trial should be a performance for the jury. He wore a pinstripe suit, a vest and gold jewelry, and in later years added a cane. He was known to use astrology in the process of jury selection.
In 1956, Boyko defended Jack Marler, a former Internal Revenue Service agent accused of tax evasion. Despite a prosecution by later-Senator Ted Stevens, Marler was acquitted on a defense of "no taxation without representation", with Boyko citing the Territory of Alaska's lack of representation in the U.S. Congress.
Boyko was appointed Attorney General for Alaska during the first administration of Governor Walter J. Hickel, from 1967-1968. Boyko helped to form the Governor's Task Force on Native Land Claims which led to the passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971
Back in private practice, Boyko's clients included Wesley Ladd (brought into the Boyko office by Boyko associate Robert T. Stange who was at one point called as a prosecution witness), accused in the 1972 murder of Ferris Rezk. Ladd was acquitted despite eyewitness testimony but later charged with the 1973 murder of Johnny Rich, who had testified for the prosecution in the Rezk case. When Ladd called Boyko/Stange to represent him in the Rich case, Boyko responded, "Sorry, only one miracle per customer."
Boyko wrote a newspaper column and hosted a radio talk show, both called The Roar of the Snow Tiger, which offered his political views and commentary. Boyko was a lifelong Democrat, but in 1990 he joined the Alaskan Independence Party (AIP) to assist former governor Walter Hickel in taking over AIP's spot on the ballot and winning the governorship.
After suffering a series of strokes in 1998, Boyko moved to the Seattle area in 1999. He died January 1, 2002 in a Des Moines, Washington hospital.

Helcystogramma helicopis is a moth in the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1922. It is found in Peru and Amazonas, Brazil.
The wingspan is 12–13 mm. The forewings are blackish with the extreme base grey and with a narrow irregular grey subbasal fascia, which is metallic blue on the costa. Beyond this is an irregular metallic-blue transverse line not reaching the costa. There is also an oblique metallic-blue streak from a white dot on the costa at two-fifths to the middle of the wing, as well as an irregular zigzag metallic-blue transverse line at three-fifths, not reaching the costa. A nearly straight grey line runs from a white dot on the costa at three-fifths to the dorsum at three-fourths and there is a pale iridescent-grey marginal line around the apex and termen, preceded by an irregular-edged narrow metallic-blue fascia. The hindwings are dark fuscous.

The G1 Aviation G1 is a French STOL ultralight aircraft, designed and produced by G1 Aviation of Tallard. The aircraft is supplied as a kit for amateur construction or as a complete ready-to-fly-aircraft.
Zenith Aircraft considers the G1 an unauthorized copy of the Zenith STOL CH 701.
Design and development
The aircraft is derived from the Alisport Yuma and was designed to comply with the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale microlight rules. It features a strut-braced high wing, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit, fixed tricycle landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration.
All G1 models have a fuselage made from welded steel tubing, with the wing made from aluminum, all covered in doped aircraft fabric. The Gelinotte variant has a span wing with an area of and features leading edge slots. The SPYL model uses vortex generators in place of the slots, has the same wing span, but a slightly smaller wing area of . All models are equipped with flaps and have optional folding wings for ground transport and storage. Standard engines available are the Rotax 912UL and the Rotax 912ULS four-stroke powerplants. The company also offers a new exhaust system for the Rotax 912 that is quieter than the stock Rotax-supplied system.
The aircraft has also been equipped with the JLT Motors Ecoyota engine.

Frederick Dennis Cambria (born January 22, 1948) is a former baseball player, a right-handed pitcher who appeared in 6 games — five as a starting pitcher — for the 1970 Pittsburgh Pirates. He stood tall, weighed and attended St. Leo University.
He was born in Cambria Heights, Queens, New York, and graduated from St. Pascal's High School in neighboring St. Alban's. Chosen by Pittsburgh in the third round of the 1969 Major League Baseball draft, Cambria was initially assigned to the Double-A York Pirates, where he won nine of 11 decisions with a low 2.16 earned run average. In his 14 appearances, he threw three shutouts. The following season he won 12 of 19 decisions for the Triple-A Columbus Jets before his recall to Pittsburgh in August 1970.
On Wednesday, August 26, he made his Major League debut as a starting pitcher against the Padres at San Diego Stadium. The first-place Pirates were embroiled in a three-team race with the Chicago Cubs and Cambria's boyhood team, the New York Mets, for the National League East Division championship. But Cambria responded, pitching six scoreless innings before allowing two runs, only one earned, on a home run by San Diego's Ed Spiezio in the seventh frame. The runs were decisive, as the Pirates lost the contest, 2–1. He followed his debut effort with seven innings of one-run baseball against the San Francisco Giants, although he did not earn a decision in that game. His lone Major League win followed six days later, as he defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 7–4 at Three Rivers Stadium, although he allowed ten hits and four earned runs in his 7⅓ innings pitched that day.
A rough outing against the St. Louis Cardinals followed on September 9, pinning Cambria with his second career defeat. But eleven days later, Cambria faced his hometown Mets in his home borough, as the starting pitcher in the second game of a doubleheader at Shea Stadium. The Mets had won the opening game to climb within 2 games of the first-place Pirates, and Cambria drew reigning Cy Young Award winning pitcher Tom Seaver as his opponent in the nightcap. But Cambria outpitched Seaver, allowing only two earned runs in 5 innings. He left the game with his team ahead 5–3, and although the Pirate bullpen allowed the Mets to tie the score at five in the seventh inning, denying Cambria the win, Pittsburgh came back to win 9–5. They eventually won the division title by five games over the second-place Cubs. Cambria did not appear in the 1970 NLCS, which the Pirates dropped in three straight games to the Cincinnati Reds.
The 1970 campaign proved to be Cambria's one trial in Major League Baseball. An arm injury forced him to alter his delivery and he left baseball after the 1973 minor league season. He graduated from St. Leo's, and later became its baseball coach and also was a minor league instructor in the Padres' organization. He also served as commissioner of the Atlantic Collegiate Baseball League.
Cambria was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the Baseball Category with the Class of 2014.

RockGen Energy Center is a 460 megawatt natural gas fired peaking power plant located near Rockdale, Wisconsin. According to Calpine, it was the largest peaking plant in Wisconsin at the time it was constructed.
Construction
In July 1998, the town of Christiana was announced as one of the possible sites for a new peaker plant in Wisconsin. The site is just east of a limestone quarry and west of a large electrical substation on land previously used for row crop farming. Shortly after the announcement, an opposition group named "Responsible Use of Rural and Agricultural Land" (RURAL) was formed to block its construction. Other sites were ruled out as more expensive and the decision was made to proceed at the Dane county location west of Rockdale. Starting in January 1999, several lawsuits were filed by RURAL and the village of Rockdale to block the construction and invalidate the air permit. The Environmental Protection Agency declined to overturn the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources issued air permit. In March 2000, tensions were high and gunshots were fired at a nearby electrical substation damaging a transformer and circuit breaker. No one was ever charged in the incident, but it was considered to be connected to the construction dispute by police. Construction began in April 2000, ten months behind schedule. In December 2000, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ended the remaining challenge allowing construction to finish. In May 2001, the $190 million facility was completed.
Around the same time period, the announcement of plans for generating stations near Edgerton (just south of the Dane / Rock county line) and Sturtevant in Racine County, "generated huge public outcry." Those plans were quickly scrapped and as of 2008, no other power plants have been constructed in Dane County. Calpine would later construct Riverside Energy Center, a larger base load, combined cycle natural gas-fired plant farther south in Rock County in the town of Beloit.
Operation
The facility began operation May 2001. In February 2003, there was a fire that placed one of the turbines temporarily out of service. The fire was caused by a high pressure air line breaking loose and catching insulation on fire. It was extinguished by plant workers with a hand-held extinguisher and local emergency crews responded without lights or sirens.
Chapter 11
Starting in 2006, the continued operation of the facility was in doubt due to the Chapter 11 filing by parent company Calpine. CIT Group, one of Calpine's creditors, took control of the facility and considered closing it in 2007, but it remained operational through the peak generating season. Natural gas prices greatly increased after the facility was constructed affecting its profitability.

History
Japanese Government Railways (JGR) had opened the Shibushi Line from to Sueyoshi (now closed) in 1923. By 1925, the line had been extended eastwards to the east coast of Kyushu at . The line was then extended northwards in phases, reaching by 1937. The track was extended further north with Kitagō opening as the northern terminus on 28 October 1941. Uchinoda was one of several intermediate stations opened on the same day on the new track. The route was designated the Nichinan Line on 8 May 1963. With the privatization of JNR on 1 April 1987, the station came under the control of JR Kyushu.
Passenger statistics
In fiscal 2016, the station was used by an average of 10 passengers (boarding only) per day.

Piatt County is a county in Illinois. According to the 2020 United States Census, it had a population of 16,673. Its county seat is Monticello.
Piatt County is part of the Champaign–Urbana, IL Metropolitan Statistical Area.
History
The first settler was George Haworth, a Quaker, followed by James Martin, Abraham Hanline, Solomon Carter and William Cordell.
Piatt County was formed in 1841 from Macon and Dewitt counties. Two local residents, James A. Piatt and Jesse Warner, were instrumental in forming the county. It was named after James A. Piatt after winning a coin flip against Jesse Warner.
Abraham Lincoln practiced law in Piatt County as a circuit lawyer. Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas planned their presidential debates in Piatt County in 1858, one of which is ornamented by a marker just south of Monticello.
The first courthouse was built in 1843. It was replaced by the current courthouse in 1904.
Illinois Power Company was a major electric utility in Central Illinois, centered in Decatur, to the west of Piatt County. At one time, Illinois had a "personal property tax", an ad valorem tax levied by the counties on property that was not real estate. The personal property tax was a major expense for the electric utilities, since their generators and transmission lines were "personal property". Under Illinois law, a corporation, such as Illinois Power, paid personal property tax to the county in which the corporate headquarters was located. Because Piatt County offered a low tax rate, Illinois Power moved its corporate headquarters to that county. This allowed Piatt County to tax utility assets over half of the state, providing a rich source of revenue which was responsible for much of the wealth of this tiny county.
Geography
According to the US Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.06%) is water.
Climate and weather
In recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Monticello have ranged from a low of in January to a high of in July, although a record low of was recorded in January 1999 and a record high of was recorded in July 1966. Average monthly precipitation ranged from in January to in August.

The Man with the Rubber Head (), also known as A Swelled Head, is a 1901 French short silent film by Georges Méliès. The film stars Méliès himself as an apothecary who blows a copy of his own head up to enormous dimensions, but who is unable to get his assistant to perform the stunt as expertly. The special effect of the inflated head, made with a novel combination of purpose-built moving equipment and multiple exposures, evokes the modern close-up and enjoys an iconic place among Méliès's works.
Plot
In a laboratory, an apothecary plans a novel experiment. Putting a living duplicate of his own head on a table, he uses a bellows to swell the head up to gigantic size. The head enjoys itself by making faces and laughing with the apothecary, who then completes the experiment by letting the air out and returning the head to normal.
The apothecary then attempts to have his assistant reproduce the experiment, but the assistant inflates the head too much, and it explodes in a bang of smoke. The angry apothecary throws the assistant out of the room.
Production
Méliès appears in the film as the apothecary and as his duplicate head. To create the illusion of the expanding head, Méliès surrounded himself with a black background and used a specially built ramp to move himself gradually closer to the stationary camera. The head was then superimposed onto the rest of the image using the multiple exposure technique. The other special effects used are substitution splices and pyrotechnics.
Release and reception
The Man with the Rubber Head was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 382–383 in its catalogues, where it was advertised as a grande nouveauté. The film was sold in American catalogues as The Man With the Rubber Head and in British catalogues as A Swelled Head.
The film is one of Méliès's best known works, and some historians have argued (though others have disagreed) that it represents a very early version of the close-up.

The Flute Concerto is a concerto for flute and orchestra by the American composer Christopher Rouse. The work was jointly commissioned by Richard and Jody Nordlof for flutist Carol Wincenc and by Borders Group for the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. It was completed August 15, 1993 and premiered October 27, 1994 at Orchestra Hall in Detroit, with conductor Hans Vonk leading Carol Wincenc and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. The piece—specifically the third movement—is dedicated to the memory of James Bulger, an English toddler who was infamously murdered in 1993 by two ten-year-old boys.
Composition
Structure
A performance of the Flute Concerto lasts approximately 23 minutes. The work is composed in five movements:
Amhrán
Alla Marcia
Elegia
Scherzo
Amhrán
Style and influences
The work contains a number of Celtic music influences. In the program notes to the score, Rouse commented on the particularly Irish influences, saying:
Instrumentation
The concerto is scored for a solo flute and orchestra comprising three flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons (2nd doubling on contrabassoon), four French horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, harp, timpani, percussion (three players), strings (violins I & II, violas, violoncellos, and double basses).
Dedication
Regarding the dedication of the piece to James Bulger, Rouse wrote:
Reception
Geoffrey Norris of Gramophone praised the piece, saying, "It expresses the shock and incomprehension that we all experienced at that appalling, senseless crime, but at the same time it enshrines the beauty and innocence of an infant life so cruelly snuffed out." Michael Tumelty of The Herald lavished the work with praise, saying "...not only is it a brilliant concert piece [...], but it is actually a masterpiece." Tumelty specifically praised the third movement, adding, "In the achingly poignant music of that Elegy, there are two purely orchestral moments, where first the music subsides then, gathering its passion and strength, resumes its statement in a huge crescendo with the entire orchestra piling in at what amounts to an anguished, collective protest at the horror. It is a shattering moment." James R. Oestreich of The New York Times also noted the third movement, calling it "the big, pulsating heart of the piece" and writing, "This is a deeply stirring monument, carried for long moments by the strings and, eventually, the whole orchestra, as the flute basically steps aside." BBC Music Magazine'''s Stephen Maddock praised the influence of Celtic music, commenting, "The outer movements – both entitled ‘Ànhran', Gaelic for song, in recognition of the composer's Celtic roots – are especially likeable, while the central Adagio confronts the terrible Bulger case more in sorrow than in anger."
Michael Dervan of The Irish Times was somewhat more critical of the concerto and called it "all a bit self-consciously accessible." Steve Metcalf of the Hartford Courant called the piece "a slighter work" in regards to Rouse's repertoire, but nevertheless described it as "nicely put together." In 2006, David Patrick Stearns of The Philadelphia Inquirer'' lauded the relevance of the concerto in a post-9/11 world, despite describing Rouse's use of Celtic influences as "without irony" and noting similarities to Henryk Górecki's Symphony No. 3. Stearns ultimately called the concerto "an island of truth" and complimented the flute writing, saying, "The five-movement piece positions the soloist more as a protagonist than a competitor with a series of dialogues and soliloquies."

The Super League (formerly known as SuperLeague and Premier League) is the top tier men's basketball league in Ireland. The league has 12 teams (11 in the Republic of Ireland and one in Northern Ireland). The league is an active member of Basketball Ireland, which is recognised by FIBA (also known as the International Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for basketball in Ireland. Neptune holds the record for most league titles, having won the competition 11 times.
Teams
History
Early years
In 1973, the Irish Basketball Association established a national basketball competition for men with two divisions. This saw many Dublin-based clubs enter their Men's A team into the top flight league, with the likes of Killester, St. Vincent's Dublin and Marian competing for supremacy against Cork-based clubs Blue Demons and Neptune. After six seasons, Kerry-born Killarney player Paudie O'Connor felt that Irish basketball was short of quality. O'Connor wanted to add glamour to the game and make it more appealing, believing showmanship and skills such as slam dunking would bring basketball to a new level in Ireland. Despite objections from the governing body and other clubs across the country, the first American players, Greg Huguley and Cornel Benford, arrived in Killarney in September 1979. Two months later, Brian Ulmer replaced Benford and St. Vincent's Killarney went on to clinch the national league title in the 1979–80 season. The addition of Americans transformed the Irish game. As a result, the league brought in regulations to limit the number of foreign-born players to two and thus prevent the full professionalisation of the league, as had happened in Britain.
A golden era
O'Connor went back to the States in 1981 and recruited Arnold Vesey and Tony Andre, the latter becoming Irish basketball's first superstar. The pair helped Killarney win their second title in three years, and their success paved the way for further American success in the top flight league. Both Cork teams, Blue Demons and Neptune, began recruiting Americans as a result of Killarney's rise, and Neptune found one of their best ever imports – Terry Strickland. Strickland helped Neptune become the ultimate powerhouse throughout the 1980s, as they won four titles in a row between 1984–85 and 1987–88. Blue Demons and Neptune had a fierce rivalry during the 1980s – every title between 1980–81 and 1990–91 was won by one of those sides (except 1981–82). Terry Strickland of Neptune and Jasper McElroy of Blue Demons led their sides to success, but had fierce competition coming up against the likes of Kelvin Troy and Mario Elie (Killester), Dave Hopla (St. Gall's), and Deora Marsh (Ballina).
While the local Irish players were all amateurs, the American imports had to register as professionals. To afford such players, sponsors were a big part of every club. The IBA promoted a scheme whereby investors put money into clubs, and in return, the players will be walking billboards for their brand. However, there were instances when the lack of big sponsors and talent led to clubs struggling to keep up with the increased competition. Marian were champions in 1978, but the new semi-professional era of the league saw them get left behind, and following the 1982–83 season, the team was relegated from the top flight league. They had a very successful campaign in Division 2 in 1983–84, finishing a close second behind Liam McHale's Ballina, and earned promotion back to the top flight. However, following the 1985–86 season, Marian were relegated for a second time, returning again for the 1987–88 season.
In 1986 and 1987, plans were put in place to reduce the number of imports a team can have. 80% of the clubs agreed that the number should be reduced from two to one, and with the support of the IBA, the ruling came into play for the 1988–89 season. There was a very negative reaction to the change in Cork, as they felt they were being unjustly treated and punished for being successful. The two main arguments made for the change was to give local Irish players more opportunities and to cut costs, with it becoming too expensive to pay two imports for some clubs. As a result of the change, the hype of Irish basketball began to wear down and the public became disinterested in the sport throughout the 1990s.
Post-halcyon
Neptune continued to be the dominant team throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Belfast's Star of the Sea began to challenge them in the late 1990s as they collected three National Championships between 1996 and 1998, and won two league titles in 1998 and 1999.
In 1998, the league's long association with sponsor Budweiser came to an end, and thus ESB became the new sponsor. In addition, a new format was introduced for the 1998–99 season. A relaunch of the league was inevitable with the change of sponsor but the IBA also took the opportunity to devise yet another new format, which resulted in the expansion of the Superleague to 14 teams – effectively, an amalgamation of the two men's national league divisions from 1997–98.
Due to the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak, the 2000–01 season was abandoned in March 2001. The 2001 title was originally not awarded to any team, despite the fact that Killester were leaders at the time of abandonment. The National Championships, due to be held on 24/25 March, were also abandoned. The following month, an IBA panel declared that Killester were the winners for 2001.
In 2003, North and South Conferences were introduced into the league. As a result, the league champion would be determined by the team who made it through to and won the grand final. Prior to 2003–04, the league title was awarded to the team who finished on top of the ladder and the runner-up was who finished second on the ladder; a post-season tournament was then held to determine a National Champion. Past National Champions include St. Vincent's (1995, 1999 and 2003), Star of the Sea (1996–98), Notre Dame (2000) and Tralee Tigers (2002). In 2012–13, the league reverted to the old model and removed conferences, re-establishing league champions as the top of the ladder finishers, and established a Champions Trophy tournament for the final two weeks of the season.
New era
In 2013, Basketball Ireland rebranded the competition and changed the name from SuperLeague to Premier League.
With the introduction of the Champions Trophy tournament, UCC Demons began to dominate the Premier League. They won the inaugural Champions Trophy title in 2013, which set them on a string of titles over the succeeding three seasons. Behind American import Lehmon Colbert and player-coach Colin O'Reilly, Demons won seven out of nine possible trophies between 2013–14 and 2015–16.
In 2015, Neptune withdrew from the Premier League following a major loss of player personnel and joined the second-tiered National League Division 1 for the 2015–16 season. That same off-season, Basketball Ireland entered a representative team into the newly established FIBA Europe Cup for the 2015–16 edition. The team was named Hibernia and was created with the sole purpose of playing in European competitions, with the team's roster filled with Premier League players.
In 2016, Basketball Ireland renamed the competition "Super League" for the 2016–17 season.

The Church of Saint-Cyr-Sainte-Julitte () is a Roman Catholic church located in Villejuif, Val-de-Marne, France. It is listed as a Historic Monument.
Location
The church is located on the town hall square. It is adjacent to the town hall.
History
The church was dedicated to Saint Cyricus and his mother Saint Julitta, two martyrs of the 4th century.
The church was founded in the 13th century and was completely renovated with dimension stone and rubbles in 1535. The bell tower has the inscription "Memento mori 1549". In 1870, the church was occupied by the Communards.
The church was listed as a Historic Monument in 1928. The organ, made by manufacturers Hippolyte Loret and Gabriel Cavaillé-Coll, is a listed monument since 1991. The stained glass windows were made by Louis-Charles-Marie Champigneulle. The bell tower was restored from 1981 to 1988.
On April 19th, 2015, a student, Sid Ahmed Ghlam, was arrested following a murder and was found to have been planning a shooting in the churches of Saint-Cyr-et-Sainte-Julitte and of St. Theresa during a Sunday Mass. According to the priest of Saint-Cyr-Sainte-Julitte, the arrest prevented a massacre, since 300 hundred people were present in the church on that day. Villejuif had already been targeted by Islamist terrorist Amedy Coulibaly during the January 2015 attacks.

In marine navigation, a pelorus is a reference tool for maintaining bearing of a vessel at sea. It is a "simplified compass" without a directive element, suitably mounted and provided with vanes to permit observation of relative bearings.
The instrument was named for one Pelorus, said to have been the pilot for Hannibal, circa 203 BC.
Ancient use
Harold Gatty described the use of a pelorus by Polynesians before the use of a compass. In equatorial waters the nightly course of stars overhead is nearly uniform during the year. This regularity simplified navigation for the Polynesians using a pelorus, or dummy compass:
Reading from North to South, in their rising and setting positions, these stars are:

| S || Southern Cross
|}
The true position of these stars is only approximate to their theoretical equidistant rhumbs on the sidereal compass. Over time, the elaboration of the pelorus points led to the modern compass rose.
Modern use
In appearance and use, a pelorus resembles a compass or compass repeater, with sighting vanes or a sighting telescope attached, but it has no directive properties. That is, it remains at any relative direction to which it is set. It is generally used by setting 000° at the lubber's line. Relative bearings are then observed. They can be converted to bearings true, magnetic, grid, etc., by adding the appropriate heading. The direct use of relative bearings is sometimes of value. A pelorus is useful, for instance, in determining the moment at which an aid to navigation is broad on the beam. It is also useful in measuring pairs of relative bearings which can be used to determine distance off and distance abeam of a navigational aid.
If the true heading is set at the lubber's line, true bearings are observed directly. Similarly, compass bearings can be observed if the compass heading is set at the lubber's line, etc. However, the vessel must be on the heading to which the pelorus is set if accurate results are to be obtained, or else a correction must be applied to the observed results. Perhaps the easiest way of avoiding error is to have the steersman indicate when the vessel is on course. This is usually done by calling out "mark, mark, mark" as long as the vessel is within a specified fraction of a degree of the desired heading. The observer, who is watching a distant object across the pelorus, selects an instant when the vessel is steady and is on course. An alternative method is to have the observer call out "mark" when the relative bearing is steady, and the steersman note the heading. If the compass is swinging at the moment of observation, the observation should be rejected. The number of degrees between the desired and actual headings is added if the vessel is to the right of the course, and subtracted if to the left. Thus, if the course is 060° and the heading is 062° at the moment of observation, a correction of 2° is added to the bearing.

Lord and Lady Algy is a lost 1919 American silent comedy film directed by Harry Beaumont and starring Tom Moore, Naomi Childers, and Frank Leigh. It is based on a play of the same name by R.C. Carton.
The film's sets were designed by the art director Hugo Ballin.
Plot
As described in a film magazine, Lord Algy (Moore) is addicted to betting, which causes an estrangement with his wife, Lady Algy (Childers). They part under an informal arrangement, although each continues to admire the other. Lord Algy determines to retrench his fortune by backing a certain horse in a race. Lady Algy, knowing the horse cannot win, makes friends with Jethroe (Stuart) to get a tip on the race, hoping to win enough to recoup her husband's losses. Mrs. Tudway (Ballin), wife of a friend of Lord Algy, plans to run away with another man. Algy learns of the plan and cooperates, allowing the elopers the use of his chambers as a rendezvous, hoping to persuade Mrs. Tudway to stay with her husband. Scandal then connects the names of Lady Algy with Jethroe and of Lord Algy with Mrs. Tudway. Algy's horse loses the race while Lady Algy's wins. Brabazon Tudway (Burress) discovers his wife in Lord Algy's chambers and suspects him of stealing her affections. Lady Algy arrives, grasps the situation at a glance, and diplomatically smooths things over. She tells Lord Algy of her success with the race and they are reunited.

Florida Forever is a land conservation program in Florida. In 1999, the Florida Legislature passed the Florida Forever Act which was signed into law by Florida governor Jeb Bush, which would lead to the creation of the Florida Forever program. Since the program was created in July 2001, the state of Florida has purchased more than 818,616 acres of land with a little over $3.1 billion (as of July 2020). Approximately 2.5 million acres have been purchased under the program and its predecessor, Preservation 2000 (P2000).
According to one 2011 poll, the program is popular and few Floridians favor cutting the funding for it.
In 2020, the program received $100 million as part of HB 5001.

Gloria Ida Joseph (1927/1928 – August 6, 2019) was a Crucian-American academic, writer, educator, and activist. She was a self-identified radical Black feminist lesbian writer who synthesized art and activism in her work. Joseph's scholarship centered race, gender, sexuality, and class. She is known for her pioneering work on Black feminism and her activism on issues concerning Black women across the diaspora, including in the Caribbean and South Africa.
Early life and education
Born Gloria Ida Joseph to Daniel Joseph and Ida David Joseph, they emigrated from Saint Croix to New York City, where Joseph was raised. She was a strong student and also played basketball and field hockey in school. She was the great-niece of philosopher Casper Holstein.
Joseph attended New York University and received her bachelor of science degree in Health, Physical Education & Recreation. Later she received her master's degree in Psychological Services at City College of New York and then worked as a guidance counselor in New York City. Joseph went on to receive her doctoral degree in educational psychology at Cornell University in 1967.
Career
Joseph worked at Hampshire College as a professor in the School of Social Sciences, where she co-founded the school's the Black studies department in 1969. Joseph also worked for COSEP, a committee where she helped recruit and retain Black and Latino students to the school. During her career she was a prolific writer and engaged the topics of feminism, race, sexuality, and activism. Joseph also founded Sisterhood in Support of Sisters in South Africa, an advocacy group for women in Soweto.
After her retirement from Hampshire College in the 1980s, she moved back to St. Croix with her life partner Audre Lorde, and continued to write and lecture at various universities as a professor emeritus for another two decades. While there, the couple founded the Che Lumumba School for Truth and the Women's Coalition of St. Croix in 1981, which focused on eradicating local gender-based violence. Joseph also founded the Doc Loc Apiary for local honey production.
After Lorde's 1992 death Joseph published The Wind Is Spirit: The Life, Love and Legacy of Audre Lorde (2016), "a compilation of essays, photos, and recollections by a diverse group of contributors ruminating on how Lorde impacted their life, work, and activism." She and Lorde discussed the project extensively before Lorde's death. Joseph used Kickstarter to help fund the writing and publication. The anthology-biography received a 2017 Lambda Literary Award and the Association for Women in Psychology's 2017 Distinguished Publication Award.

Encounters of the Spooky Kind () is a 1980 Hong Kong martial arts comedy horror film directed by and starring Sammo Hung, who also wrote the film with Huang Ying, and produced by Hung's production company Bo Ho Film Company. Released as Spooky Encounters in the United States and also known as Close Encounters of the Spooky Kind, the latter title more blatantly mimicking the title of the film Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Encounters of the Spooky Kind was the progenitor of the jiangshi film genre and one of Hong Kong's first action horror comedies.
The film was followed by a stand-alone sequel starring Hung and Lam Ching-ying, Encounters of the Spooky Kind II (also known as Close Encounters of the Spooky Kind 2) in 1990, which has no relation to Encounters of the Spooky Kind.
Plot
The film starts with Bold Cheung having a nightmare about two ghosts, an elder and the young adult, first in a wine jar and then as a human. Cheung narrowly escapes the two ghosts, but they still pursue him.
Bold Cheung is challenged to spend the night in an abandoned house where he must peel an apple in front of a mirror. If he breaks the skin then something bad will happen. Upholding his mantle as the boldest he accepts. However, that night whilst peeling the apple his friends trick him. Whilst scolding his friend for the prank a real ghost appears and snatches Cheung's friend away. The ghost reaches for Cheung but he cuts its hand off and then quickly shattering the mirror, causing the house to collapse.
The next day Cheung overhears a story about a promiscuous wife from a sweet tofu seller (who admits that something similar happened to him and his wife); he goes to his home to check on his wife and finds two peeping toms outside his door. He scolds them, causing his wife and employer, Master Tam, to hear. Tam escapes but leaves his shoe which Cheung finds and confronts his wife with. His wife pulls a tantrum and makes Cheung feel guilty.
Master Tam is worried Cheung will find out about the affair so he hires a Mao Shan witch, Chin Hoi, to get rid of him. When Chin mentions this to his junior disciple, Priest Tsui, Tsui gets angry stating that it is against the rules of their sect and is then kicked out by Chin. Cheung is tricked into spending the night in a temple, but he encounters Tsui who tells him that he must sleep on the roof. Cheung does so. A coffin in the temple opens and a jiangshi, a hopping corpse, begins looking for him but he is safe. Chin gives up when he cannot find Cheung (he is controlling the jiangshi) just as Cheung falls down. Chin and the cadaver look for Cheung again. He hides under the coffin but is found, the two fight but by this time the sun was rising so Chin had to move the corpse back into the coffin.
Cheung is tricked into spending another night in the temple. Again he meets Tsui who tells him to collect fifty chicken eggs to throw into the coffin. If he runs out of eggs he must throw dog's blood over the jiangshi. However, the egg seller puts in ten duck eggs. That night Cheung throws in eggs when the coffin begins to open and it works. However, when he throws a duck egg inside, the corpse escapes so Cheung throws the dog's blood onto it which sends Chin flying into Tam's roof severing his control of the jiangshi.
Cheung goes back to town but an Inspector arrests him for murdering his wife even though it is a set-up. Cheung is thrown in prison but escapes by pretending to be sick, he beats up the guards and runs into a forest where he trips over a coffin exposing the corpse within. As Cheung sleeps it comes to life and mimics his actions before an evil force causes it to attack and chase him. Whilst on the run from the corpse Cheung bumps into the Inspector and his men. The jiangshi collapses onto the Inspector giving Cheung time to escape.
Cheung meets up with Tsui who wants to take Cheung as his disciple. As they stop to eat, the Inspector shows up and sends his men after Cheung. Chin is also there and manipulates Cheung's right arm to beat up the people around him and himself however Tsui stops him in a sword fight and Chin escapes. To help Cheung, Tsui uses his magic to manipulate the Inspector's men to fight the Inspector whilst he and Cheung escape.
Tsui initiates Cheung as his disciple at an abandoned Taoist altar drawing talismans onto Cheung's body. He also gives Cheung his undergarment as protection. Meanwhile Chin sends a vampire after Tsui and Cheung but they defeat it and Tsui uses his magic to force the corpse to tell them where Chin was hiding. They then go to Tam's house to challenge Chin. Both sorcerers use magic to instill spirits into their disciples. Cheung is possessed by the monkey god and Chin's disciple by the Dragon Taming Arhat. The two possessed apprentices fight with Cheung winning. Chin then forces Master Tam to be possessed with the spirit of Lu Dong Bin but Cheung who is possessed by Hong Hai Er kills him. Then the two sorcerers unleash their magic on each other and Tsui is badly injured with Chin's sorcery because he gave his magic undergarment to Cheung. Just as it looks like Chin will win Cheung cuts the legs off his altar which causes Chin to lose balance giving Tsui a chance to hit him with magical fire, Chin is set ablaze and falls off his altar to burn to death. However, Tsui is badly hurt by Chin's magic and he too falls off his altar dead. Cheung's wife steps forward in all the madness and tries to convince Cheung that Tam was about to rape her. However, Cheung is not deceived and he punches her over and over again, then throws her.

Informationist poetry was a literary movement of the 1990s in Scotland. The poets usually associated with this movement are: Richard Price – who coined the term in 1991 in the magazine Interference – Robert Crawford, W. N. Herbert, David Kinloch, Peter McCarey and Alan Riach.
The anthology Contraflow on the SuperHighway (Southfields, 1994), edited by Price and Herbert, set the parameters for the movement; Vennel Press published collections by the Informationists; and the magazines Verse, Gairfish and Southfields addressed Informationist concerns. Iain Bamforth, Kathleen Jamie, Alison Kermack and Don Paterson, though not included in the anthology, are referenced in Price's introduction as contemporaries with similar interests and aesthetics.
One of the features of Informationist poetry is its engagement with and deliberate mixing of different linguistic registers, and the interrogation of language's power-bearing qualities in the process. Informationism can be seen as a descendant of Oulipo for its creative use of rules-based procedures, notably in the work of Peter McCarey's monumental Syllabary project, which attempts a poem for every spoken syllable in the English language, randomising the presentation on its dedicated website. All the poets are also translators of poetry and internationalism and translation itself are arguably themes in their work.
Informationism can also be fruitfully grouped with the later flarf movement as both explore technological innovation, jargons of various kinds and the interconnectedness of the "information society" in an often irreverent and perhaps subversive mode. However, the combination of lyric and experimental aesthetics probably bears better comparison with American Hybrid poets such as Peter Gizzi and Harryette Mullen (after the anthology edited by Cole Swensen and David St. John in 2009). The twentieth-century poets Hugh MacDiarmid and Edwin Morgan were particularly influential on the Informationists.
In 2013 and 2014, Kinloch, McCarey and Price toured with Iain Bamforth as Informationists in "The Last Men on Mercury" tour, reading in Manchester, London, Geneva, Strasbourg and Glasgow.

Phyllonorycter celtisella is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from Ontario in Canada and Connecticut, Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Texas in the United States.
The larvae feed on Celtis species, including Celtis occidentalis. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a blotch mine on the upperside of the leaf. The larva, of the cylindrical type in the later stages, enters the leaf on the lower surface, and makes a narrow linear mine, then cuts through the parenchyma to the upper side, where the mine broadens into an elongated blotch, made tent-like by a longitudinal ridge in each epidermis. The larvae eat the entire parenchyma, leaving merely the dark discoloured cuticles of the leaf.

Color quality scale (CQS) is a color rendering score – a quantitative measure of the ability of a light source to reproduce colors of illuminated objects. Developed by researchers at NIST the metric aims to overcome some of the issues inherent in the widely used color rendering index (CIE Ra, 1974).
The color space used in CIE Ra (CRI) is outdated and nonuniform, and CQS uses CIELAB as a replacement.
The Von Kries chromatic adaptation transform used by Ra does not perform as well as other available models. CQS uses CMCCAT2000.
CIE Ra is based on desaturated samples, and a lamp's performance in rendering these samples fideliously is not necessarily linked to how it may perform with samples of higher saturation. CQS uses higher saturation samples.
‘Pure' fidelity (where all deviations are considered bad) does not account for desired chromaticity changes. Increased saturation might be preferred. CQS does not penalise against increases in saturation.
In CIE Ra the arithmetic mean is taken of the color differences for the individual samples. In CQS the individual results are combined through a root mean square instead, so that a small number of poorly rendered objects reflects with greater strength in the overall result.
Negative values of CQS are made impossible due to their potential for consumer confusion.
CCTs of lower than 2800K are penalised so that the CQS is more representative of their actual color rendering as opposed to their fidelity.
The CQS generates the general index Qa. Several manufacturers are beginning to publish data on CQS scores of their products, including some who claim light sources with CQS scores up to 97.

Prince Ludwig Rudolph of Hanover (Ludwig Rudolph Georg Wilhelm Philipp Friedrich Wolrad Maximilian Prinz von Hannover; 21 November 1955 – 29 November 1988) was a member of the House of Hanover and a music producer.
Early life and career
Ludwig Rudolph was born in Hanover, Lower Saxony, Germany, the third child and second son of Ernst August, Prince of Hanover, Hereditary Prince of Brunswick (1914–1987) and his wife Princess Ortrud of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (1925–1980). Ludwig Rudolph was a great-great-great-great-grandson of George III of the United Kingdom and a great-grandson of Wilhelm II, German Emperor.
Ludwig Rudolph had trained to become a music producer in Los Angeles and London.
Marriage and death
Having obtained the consent of Elizabeth II by Order in Council on 15 September 1987 pursuant to the Royal Marriages Act 1772, Ludwig Rudolph, a Lutheran, married the Roman Catholic Countess Isabella Maria von Thurn und Valsassina-Como-Vercelli (born 1962 in Gmunden, Upper Austria), a former fashion model at her father's ancestral Austrian estate, Bleiburg Castle, Carinthia on 4 October 1987. She was the daughter of Count Ariprand von Thurn und Valsassina-Como-Vercelli (1925-1996), whose family, a branch of the Della Torre dynasty, ruled Milan in the 13th century, and his wife, née Princess Maria von Auersperg (born 1929). Ludwig Rudolph and Isabelle had one son:
Prince Otto Heinrich Ariprand George Johannes Ernst August Vinzenz Egmont Franz of Hanover (born 13 February 1988)
In the early hours of 29 November 1988, after the couple had entertained guests at their home, Königinvilla (The Queen's Villa) in Gmunden, a house left to them by Ludwig's brother Ernst August, the prince went to the bedroom where his wife had retired before midnight, and found Isabelle sprawled fully dressed across their bed. The efforts of her husband and friends to revive her proved futile. As authorities later removed her body and investigated the scene, discovering syringes, cocaine and heroin, Ludwig Rudolph, who had been investigated previously on suspicion of illegal drug purchases, placed a call to his elder brother, Ernst August, in London, imploring him to take care of the couple's 10-month-old son. Then he slipped away. Several hours later Ludwig Rudolph was found near his family's hunting lodge several miles away, on Lake Traun. He was in his car with the motor running. He had the muzzle of a rifle in his mouth and was dead of a gunshot wound.
The case was closed without further investigation. Ludwig Rudolph and Isabelle were interred on 2 December 1988 at Grünau im Almtal, Austria, having been married less than 14 months. Custody of their infant son Otto Heinrich was awarded, contrary to the expressed wishes of Ludwig Rudolph, to the child's maternal grandparents. He grew up at their castle, Schloss Bleiburg, in Austria, and then studied art at Braunschweig University of Art in Brunswick (Braunschweig). He lives with his maternal grandmother in Salzburg.

The Cuckooland Museum, previously known as the Cuckoo Clock Museum, is a museum that exhibits mainly cuckoo clocks, located in Tabley, Cheshire, England. The collection comprises 300 years of cuckoo clock-making history, since the very earliest examples made in the 18th to the 21st century.
Establishment and foundational reasons
The museum was set up in 1990 by brothers Roman and Maz Piekarski after bringing together a collection of antique Black Forest cuckoo clocks that has been continuously increased ever since. Both men were trained as clockmakers in Manchester from the age of 15, which is when their fascination with these timepieces began.
It became apparent to them that an important part of European clock-making history was liable to disappear if surviving examples fell into irretrievable disrepair. Their guiding principles have always been to purchase objects only of the highest museum quality and which held an important significance in the historical development of cuckoo timekeeping.
In Roman Piekarski's own words: When we started collecting in the 1970s no one wanted them because battery and electric clocks were all the rage. We picked many up for next to nothing.
The collection
In the past, the exhibition also included other kind of timepieces such as longcase, wall and bracket clocks but now focuses on cuckoo clocks especially.
The museum also hosts a range of Black Forest cuckoo and quail clocks, trumpeter clocks, monks playing bells and other associated musical movements.
Cuckooland has nowadays more than 700 cuckoo clocks on display of different styles, sizes, manufacturers and ages. Many of the timekeepers are very rare and the collection contains the best examples of the cuckoo clockmaker's art:
They have a "cuckoo and echo" clock that emulates the whistles and bellows the bird makes in the wild and is thought to be one of only six in the world.
The museum also displays many timepieces made by Johann Baptist Beha, one of the most reputed, innovative and creative Black Forest clockmaker of all times.
Examples in Art Nouveau, Arts and Crafts and other unusual styles.
Other rarities include; picture frame cuckoo clocks, several timepieces with a life size automaton cuckoo bird on top of the case, models combined with paintings of people or animals with blinking or flirty eyes, etc.
Designer cuckoo clocks, a series of avant-garde 21st-century creations autographed by foremost international designers such as (in alphabetical order): Christie Bassil, Lorenzo Damiani, Mattia Cimadoro, Raffaele Darra and Riccardo Paolino & Matteo Fusi.
Research and conservation
Throughout the years, the attendance of the two brothers at clock fairs and auctions, the purchasing of specialized bibliography, trips, the internet, their own research, etc., have led them to acquire many of the clocks, gaining experience and knowledge on the subject. They document all of the aspects related to every piece of the collection in terms of: age, history, manufacturer, style, technical aspects and provenance.
One of the aims of the museum is to restore and preserve the most unusual, outstanding and unusual exemplaries to be enjoyed by future generations, as well as to contribute to the appreciation and estimation of this timepiece through its importance in horology and historic significance in the Western culture.

CUTE-1.7 + APD (Cubical Tokyo Tech Engineering satellite 1.7 plus Avalanche Photodiode) or CO-56 (Cubesat-Oscar-56) or just OSCAR 56 was an amateur radio satellite in the form of a double CubeSat. The satellite used commercial off-the-shelf components extensively, in particular, it used the Hitachi NPD-20JWL PDA as a control computer, and it used a USB hub for sensor communications. At the end of its mission, the satellite was supposed to deploy an electrodynamic tether to help it deorbit. The satellite failed early into its mission, so the electodynamic tether experiment probably did not happen. It was launched on February 21, 2006 on board a Japanese launcher M-V.
On 16 March 2006, the communication system malfunctioned so that it was transmitting unmodulated carrier wave and unable to communicate. The satellite decayed from orbit on 25 October 2009. A follow-up mission, CUTE-1.7 + APD II, was launched in April 2008 and remains operational.

Marco Vinicio Cerezo Arévalo (born 26 December 1942) is a Guatemalan politician and the current Secretary General of the Central American Integration System (SICA). He served as President of Guatemala from 14 January 1986 to 14 January 1991.
Career
Cerezo was born in Guatemala City, the son of the Supreme Court judge Marco Vinicio Cerezo Sierra, and came from a well-known liberal family. In 1962 he was a member of the student body of the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala (USAC) that played an important part in the national protests against the government of Miguel Ydígoras. In 1964 he joined the Guatemalan Christian Democrats (DCG), a party that was banned from standing in the 1966 elections. He graduated in Judicial science from USAC in 1968, the same year in which the DCG was formally legalized, and was made its Secretary in 1970. From that time, and with a very tense political situation, Cerezo was forced to hire permanent protection. In February 1981, in the worst of 3 assassination attempts, his vehicle was attacked with hand grenades and machine gun fire in the center of the capital.
In 1974 the DCG formed part of the coalition that backed General Efraín Ríos Montt for president. Amidst allegations of fraud Ríos Montt lost to Kjell Eugenio Laugerud. Cerezo was elected a deputy in the National Congress where the DCG, with 14 seats, became the largest party within the opposition.
In 1978 General Ricardo Peralta Méndez, the DCG candidate came second to Fernando Romeo Lucas García. During the Lucas García era 150 members of the DCG were murdered. The three surviving members of the Congress and the party were forced into hiding, not because of a ban but in fear of their lives. Yet Cerezo appeared at the March 1982 elections to support the opposition candidate Alejandro Maldonado Aguirre who lost out to the official candidate Ángel Aníbal Guevara. Suspecting fraud Maldonado and Cerezo and their followers launched a campaign denouncing the result. The result became academic when Efraín Ríos Montt took power in a coup, which the DCG and Cerezo initially supported. When it became clear that the repression in the countryside was becoming more indiscriminate, and, perhaps more importantly, that Ríos Montt was fanatically preaching an evangelical, messianic born again type of Christianity, Cerezo withdrew his support for the regime and demanded new elections. In 1983 General Óscar Humberto Mejía took power in another coup, which Cerezo cautiously supported. The DCG gained 21.2% of the vote in the 1984 National Congress elections, and with 20 of the 88 seats was the largest party. With this success behind them the DCG decided to postulate Cerezo for the 1985 presidential election. He began to promote the idea of talking to the United Guatemalan National Revolutionaries (URNG), an umbrella group containing the main three guerrilla groups.
President (1986–1991)
In the first round of the 1985 presidential elections on 3 November, Cerezo came first with 38.6% of the popular vote, and in the second round on 8 December he defeated Jorge Carpio with 68.4% of the vote. The DCG gained 51 of the 100 seats in conference, and also gained a majority in many municipalities across the country. He was both the first democratically elected president and the first civilian to take office since 1966. In his inauguration, which was met with great hopes amongst the population, he promised to ensure that what he called the dark forces of the right would not be able to break the public order or the state. He promised to change Guatemala within his first 126 days. Some of his first actions as president were to force army chief of staff and suspected human rights abuser Rodolfo Lobos Zamora to retire from the military, and to name Jaime Hernández Méndez as Minister of Defence, in what was described as a "test of wills" with the Army.
The response was a new wave of terror, with many extrajudicial killings being committed by Guatemalan security forces. This battle against the forces of terror operating in the country was to be the dominant theme of his rule. According to NGO Americas Watch in 1986, 100 people a month were dying in the conflict at that time. He declared Guatemala neutral in the civil wars that were occurring in neighboring El Salvador and Nicaragua. He was a great supporter of the idea of a Central American Parliament. There were two important conferences on Central American integration in Esquipulas—the second of which, in August 1987, established the Procedure for a firm and lasting peace, the most important milestone in re-establishing peace in the region.
On 11 September 1987, he established the National Commission for Reconciliation (CNR), and on 7 October negotiations between the URNG and the government began. When they failed two days later, with the government refusing to accept the URNG's terms, Cerezo asked the United States of America for more military aid to further the counter insurgency efforts of the armed forces. On 28 October, Congress passed a general political amnesty. Amidst rumors of plots and possible assassination attempts against Cerezo, many also began to consider him as powerless and ineffective. After a farcical attempt by two colonels to take power on 11 May 1988, on 19 May an Air force unit made a series of demands of the government, including breaking ties with pro-USSR countries and stopping any contacts with the URNG, as well as more money for better equipment and the removal of many local politicians. Cerezo admitted that he had had to submit to some of the military's demands in order to avoid a coup taking place. In August there was a three-week general strike in protest against the liberalization of petrol and other sources of fuel.
1989 saw a worsening of the political situation, with 1,600 assassinations and 800 kidnappings or disappearances in the first half of the year. These were attributed to the political violence and the covert war between suspected extrajudicial right-wing forces and the URNG. On 9 May another attempted coup failed, and though the perpetrators were sentenced to long terms in jail that November, they were released on appeal the following January. On 1 August, DCG Secretary General Danilo Barillas was assassinated, but on 25 August Cerezo came back with a new promise to renovate the public administration by consolidating democracy within the 500 days he had left as president. Guatemala has remained a democracy ever since.
In May 1990, an important agreement was signed in Madrid with the URNG in which they promised not to disturb the forthcoming elections. With this success behind him, Cerezo felt able to give a positive recapitulation of his presidency, and he was able to hand power over to his successor Jorge Serrano in the first democratic transition of power since 1951. The DCG performed poorly in the presidential elections, with its candidate, Alfonso Cabrera Hidalgo, not getting past the first round. Despite this, they still managed to win 27 seats in the National Congress.
That same year, as part of a thaw in Soviet–Guatemalan diplomatic relations, Cerezo invited the noted Russian linguist and epigrapher Yuri Knorozov to Guatemala to present him with a medal. Knorozov had been instrumental in the decipherment of Maya hieroglyphics, and this was the first opportunity for the scholar to visit the lands and sites of the former Maya civilization.
Then on 1 December, a troop of soldiers massacred 24 campesinos in Santiago Atitlán in the department of Sololá. In the resulting outcry, the US suspended military aid to Guatemala. Despite having supported the previous coups that lead to human rights abuses in the countryside, President Cerezo claims to have stopped the massacre himself.
Post-presidency
In 1991 Cerezo became a deputy in the Central American Parliament in its first five-year term. He was accused of hiding behind the immunity conferred here and in his role as ex-President in order to avoid a variety of charges, including fraud in the buying of a Jordan island, the covering up of the murder of Myrna Mack Chang and the concession of a large piece of land to a conservation group owned by Cerezo's son Marco Vinicio Cerezo Blandón.
In the 1999 elections, the first for which the DCG did not offer a presidential candidate, Cerezo won one of the two National Congress seats gained by his party. He was re-elected to Congress for the 2004-08 period in the November 2003 election, this time as the DCG's sole deputy.
At the 2007 election Cerezo lost his seat in Congress and his party gained no seats. His son, also named Vinicio Cerezo, ran for president but received less than 1% of the vote.
Vinicio Cerezo is currently building an NGO (nongovernmental organization) named Esquipulas after Esquipulas Procedure for a firm and lasting peace and a new Esquipulas conference called Esquipulas III (to follow the previous Esquipulas I and II) to further the integration of Central America, directed by Olinda Salguero. He also is a political consultant.
His appointment as Secretary General of the Central America Integration System (SICA) was announced on 29 June 2017, during the 49th gathering in San Jose, Costa Rica. He was named Peace Ambassador by the Guatemala Government on 7 August 2017, in the anniversary of the Esquipulas II agreements.

Park Bum Shin (박범신; born August 24, 1946) is a South Korean writer.
Life
Park Bum Shin was born in Nonsan, Chungcheongnam-do. He graduated from Jeonju National University of Education, Wonkwang University and Korea University. While working as a Korean language teacher at a middle school, he made his literary debut in 1973 with the short story Remains of the Summer (Yeoreum ui janhae), which won him the JoongAng Ilbo's New Year's Literary Contest. In the same year, along with the poets Kim Seung-hui and Jeong Ho-seung, Park founded a literary group called the 73 Group.
After 28 years of teaching in Myongji University's creative program, he retired in 2011. Upon his retirement from the academe and the release of his 39th novel My Hand Turns into a Horseshoe, Park moved back to his hometown, where he concentrates only on writing. He also writes his diaries, which he plans to publish.
Work
In 1979, Park began serializing his first novel Lie Like a Leaf of Grass (Pullipcheoreom nupda) in the JoongAng Ilbo, which would become known as his signature work. For the work's sensitive, even poetic, descriptions of the losses sustained by the Korean people in the period of rapid urbanization, Park received the 1981 Korean Literature Prize.
More serialized novels followed, which exhibited Park's lyrical but realistic style, which details the dreams and frustrations of average citizens adrift in a world of base materialism and brutal opportunism. Of special note are Fire Nation (Bul-ui nara) and Water Nation (Mul-ui nara), which appeared in The Dong-a Ilbo in the early and mid-1980s and won critical recognition. The stories are satirical portrayals of the upsets, ambitions and disappointments of two country boys Baek Chan-gyu and Han Gil-su, who move to Seoul as it rushes toward industrialization and urbanization. The novels reflect the author's own experience of urban life as a young man.
In 1979, Park began serializing his first novel Lie Like a Leaf of Grass (Pullipcheoreom nupda) in the JoongAng Ilbo, which would become known as his signature work. For the work's sensitive, even poetic, descriptions of the losses sustained by the South Korean people in the period of rapid urbanization, Park received the 1981 Korean Literature Prize.
In addition to his two hit novels, Park also wrote other works set against the period of South Korea's economic rise, such as The Forest Never Sleeps (Supeun jamdeulji anneunda) and I Listen to Mozart on Wednesdays (Suyoil ein Mochareuteu leul deudneunda). These works describe the dreams of city dwellers frustrated by powers beyond their control, but are narrated in a style close to that of popular romantic or detective novel. The more popular his novels became, however, the more Park resented being characterized as an author catering to public taste. In 1993, with over 20 years of best-selling literature to his name, Park suddenly announced in a newspaper article that he was unable to continue writing his novel, then in progress. The author, whose two suicide attempts as a youth speaks to deep thirst for communication with the world, could not endure criticism and discontinued writing for three years until 1996, when he published The Cart Pulled by the White Cow (Heuin so ga ggeuneun sure).
Park's return to novel writing led to more highly developed artistic works, including re-workings of some of his older novels. More recently, he has written penetrating recollections of his own life as an author, as well as passionate works about nature and life based on his travels and experiences in foreign cultures and spaces. In A Filthy Desk (Deoreoun chaeksang, co-winner of the Manhae Prize for Literature in 2003), Empty Room (Bin bang) and Namaste (Namseute), Park confirmed his position as a veteran author who incorporates both artistic value and popular elements into his writing.
Amid the crisis of publishing in a post-industrial society, in 2008 Park became the first South Korean veteran novelist to post his novel on the Internet before publishing it in print. His novel Cholatse was serialized in top internet portal Naver for five months where it received 1 million hits. Through the new technology, Park said it was a great pleasure for him to learn the readers' responses to his work.
The popularity of his novels led to 20 subsequent film and television adaptations, which made Park a household name. Among them, Park said he was most excited about the 2012 film A Muse. Adapted from his provocative 2010 novel Eun-gyo in which a poet in his 70s who falls for a high school girl, Park said it reflected his own personal thoughts on aging, human psychology and desire.
"I've always gone for the second best options in my life," Park told reporters at a press meeting held in central Seoul in 2011. "It was the only way to compromise. I had too many things to take care of at once. But from now on, I want writing to be my top priority, nothing else."

Bouea macrophylla, commonly known as gandaria or plum mango or mango plum in English, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. The tree belongs to the family Anacardiaceae which also includes mango and cashew.
Description
The evergreen tree grows to heights of 25 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate to elliptic in shape (see: Leaf shape), and range from 13 to 45 cm (5 to 17 inches) long and from 5 to 7 cm (2 to 3 inches) wide.
The fruit (resembling a mango) are green in colour and mature to an orange/yellow, with the seed being pink. They grow to roughly 2 to 5 cm (0.7 to 1.9 inches) in diameter. The entire fruit, including its skin is edible. The fruit range from sweet to sour in flavor similar to the Alphonso mango, and have a light smell of turpentine. When ripe, the fruit is soft and has fibrous mango-like seeds.
Flowering and fruiting times differ for Thailand and Indonesia.
Thailand : flowers in November to December, and fruit appears from April to May.
Indonesia : flowers in June to November, and fruit appears from March to June.
Distribution
The tree is native to Indonesia, and Burma. It is also found in Thailand, Laos, and Malaysia, where it is commercially grown.
Uses
Consumption
Both the leaves and fruit from the tree can be eaten. The leaves can be eaten raw when they are still young, and can be used in salads. While the seed is edible, the endosperm is generally bitter. The fruit is very acidic and has a mango-like flavour. It can be eaten raw, or made into dishes such as pickle, compote, or sambal. Unripened fruit can be used to make rojak and asinan.
Functional
The entire tree can be used as an ornamental fruit bearing shade tree due to its dense foliage.
Other names
Bouea macrophylla is commonly known in English as the "marian plum", "gandaria", "plum mango" and "mango plum". In Malay, the tree is known as kundang in Malay and its fruit buah kundang. The Malays differentiate between two varieties:
Kundang daun kecil ("small-leaf kundang") also known as remia, remnia or rumenia.
Kundang daun besar ("large-leaf kundang"), also known as kundang hutan ("jungle kundang) or setar. This usually refers to Bouea oppositifolia, and is the origin of the toponym Alor Setar (with alor meaning "small stream").
In Indonesian, it is known as ramania and gandaria. It is also known in Thai as maprang (มะปราง), mayong (มะยง) and mayong chit (มะยงชิด). In Burmese as mayan-thi (မရန်းသီး); and in Vietnamese as thanh trà.
In 2015 a major retailer introduced the fruit to the British public under the name plango, apparently a portmanteau word for "plum" and "mango". At the time the announcements noted the resemblance of the fruit to plums and mangoes, and some of the local press deliberately or naively announced that the fruit was a cross between a plum and a mango, which is not botanically plausible as plums and mangoes are not in the same family.

2021 Azerbaijani Mil Mi-17 crash, also known as Garaheybat helicopter crash () occurred on 30 November 2021, during military drills of Azerbaijani State Border Service (SBS) Mil Mi-17 helicopter in the Garaheybat training zone located in the Khizi District. Fourteen people were killed and two were injured in the helicopter crash. This was the largest aircraft crash in the history of Azerbaijan's law enforcement agencies.
Immediately after the accident, the representatives of the SBS and the Prosecutor General's Office arrived at scene. An investigation was launched under the leadership of Deputy Chief of the Prosecutor General's Office Elchin Mammadov. The cause of the accident is still being investigated.
President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev and Vice President Mehriban Aliyeva, President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and other political figures in the country, foreign embassies in Azerbaijan, as well as international organizations expressed condolences to the victims.
Background
The deadliest helicopter crash in the history of Azerbaijan took place on 20 November 1991, near Karakend, in Khojavend District, which resulted in the deaths of 22 people, including senior government officials. Furthermore, on 24 July 2019, an Azerbaijani Air Force MIG-29 aircraft carrying out drills suddenly disappeared from radars. The pilot, Lieutenant Colonel Rashad Atakishiyev, went missing as the plane crashed into the Caspian Sea. His body was recovered after a long-running search.
Crash
On 30 November 2021, at about 10:40 local time, an Azerbaijani State Border Service Mil Mi-17 helicopter took off from the Sangachal airfield and crashed during drills at the Garaheybat training zone, located within the Khizi District.The head of the State Border Service of Azerbaijan, Elchin Guliyev, stated that the pilot was experienced and that he was a participant in the First Karabakh War, that the helicopter was almost new and had recently been repaired. Guliyev stated that the flight recorder of the helicopter was found, adding that no outside forces were involved in the incident. Emil Jafarov, a lieutenant colonel among the event's two survivors, said that there were no signs prior to the incident that the plane could crash.
According to preliminary reports, two colonels, three majors, four captains, two lieutenants and a civilian contractor were killed, while a colonel and a captain were injured in the crash.
Aftermath
Immediately after the incident, the representatives of the State Border Service and the Prosecutor General's Office arrived at scene. A criminal case under Article 352.2 of the Criminal Code (violation of flight or flight preparation rules caused the death of two or more people through negligence) and other articles was initiated by the Prosecutor General's Office and the investigation was taken under special control by the Prosecutor General. The investigation team investigating the helicopter crash was headed by Deputy Chief of the Investigation Department of the Prosecutor General's Office Elchin Mammadov. The cause of the accident was not immediately clear. The bodies of the victims were brought to the Forensic Medical Expertise and Pathological Anatomy Association of the Ministry of Health in Baku, and after examination they were handed over to their families.
The head of the State Border Service of Azerbaijan Elchin Guliyev stated that the soldiers died in the accident would be given the status of "martyrs", noting that President Ilham Aliyev instructed to clarify the details of the incident, bury the fallen and do everything necessary to treat the wounded. Guliyev said he spoke on the phone with the two servicemen injured in the accident and that their state was normal.
Azerbaijan initially did not release the names of the victims, in accordance with the practice of most countries, which do not release the names until the victims' closest relatives have been alerted. The lack of more detailed information as the time passed since the incident, and the fact that the accident occurred immediately after the meetings in Ashgabat and Sochi, raised questions and misinformation in the Azerbaijani public. Political scientist Zardusht Alizadeh rejected the conspiracy theories, and added there were no suspicious case in the incident. He also stressed that this was not the first accident in the history of Azerbaijan, adding that such accidents occur all over the world.
President of Azerbaijan along with several domestic and foreign officials mourned the loss and shared condolence messages.

In cryptography, an interpolation attack is a type of cryptanalytic attack against block ciphers.
After the two attacks, differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis, were presented on block ciphers, some new block ciphers were introduced, which were proven secure against differential and linear attacks. Among these there were some iterated block ciphers such as the KN-Cipher and the SHARK cipher. However, Thomas Jakobsen and Lars Knudsen showed in the late 1990s that these ciphers were easy to break by introducing a new attack called the interpolation attack.
In the attack, an algebraic function is used to represent an S-box. This may be a simple quadratic, or a polynomial or rational function over a Galois field. Its coefficients can be determined by standard Lagrange interpolation techniques, using known plaintexts as data points. Alternatively, chosen plaintexts can be used to simplify the equations and optimize the attack.
In its simplest version an interpolation attack expresses the ciphertext as a polynomial of the plaintext. If the polynomial has a relative low number of unknown coefficients, then with a collection of plaintext/ciphertext (p/c) pairs, the polynomial can be reconstructed. With the polynomial reconstructed the attacker than has a representation of the encryption, without exact knowledge of the secret key.
The interpolation attack can also be used to recover the secret key.
It is easiest to describe the method with an example.
Example
Let an iterated cipher be given by
where is the plaintext, the output of the round, the secret round key (derived from the secret key by some key schedule), and for a -round iterated cipher, is the ciphertext.
Consider the 2-round cipher. Let denote the message, and denote the ciphertext.
Then the output of round 1 becomes
and the output of round 2 becomes
Expressing the ciphertext as a polynomial of the plaintext yields
where the 's are key dependent constants.
Using as many plaintext/ciphertext pairs as the number of unknown coefficients in the polynomial , then we can construct the polynomial. This can for example be done by Lagrange Interpolation (see Lagrange polynomial). When the unknown coefficients have been determined, then we have a representation of the encryption, without knowledge of the secret key .
Existence
Considering an -bit block cipher, then there are possible plaintexts, and therefore distinct pairs. Let there be unknown coefficients in . Since we require as many pairs as the number of unknown coefficients in the polynomial, then an interpolation attack exist only if .
Time complexity
Assume that the time to construct the polynomial using pairs are small, in comparison to the time to encrypt the required plaintexts. Let there be unknown coefficients in . Then the time complexity for this attack is , requiring known distinct pairs.
Interpolation attack by Meet-In-The-Middle
Often this method is more efficient. Here is how it is done.
Given an round iterated cipher with block length , let be the output of the cipher after rounds with .
We will express the value of as a polynomial of the plaintext , and as a polynomial of the ciphertext . Let be the expression of via , and let be the expression of via . The polynomial is obtained by computing forward using the iterated formula of the cipher until round , and the polynomial is obtained by computing backwards from the iterated formula of the cipher starting from round until round .
So it should hold that
and if both and are polynomials with a low number of coefficients, then we can solve the equation for the unknown coefficients.
Time complexity
Assume that can be expressed by coefficients, and can be expressed by coefficients. Then we would need known distinct pairs to solve the equation by setting it up as a matrix equation. However, this matrix equation is solvable up to a multiplication and an addition. So to make sure that we get a unique and non-zero solution, we set the coefficient corresponding to the highest degree to one, and the constant term to zero. Therefore, known distinct pairs are required. So the time complexity for this attack is , requiring known distinct pairs.
By the Meet-In-The-Middle approach the total number of coefficients is usually smaller than using the normal method. This makes the method more efficient, since fewer pairs are required.
Key-recovery
We can also use the interpolation attack to recover the secret key .
If we remove the last round of an -round iterated cipher with block length , the output of the cipher becomes . Call the cipher the reduced cipher. The idea is to make a guess on the last round key , such that we can decrypt one round to obtain the output of the reduced cipher. Then to verify the guess we use the interpolation attack on the reduced cipher either by the normal method or by the Meet-In-The-Middle method. Here is how it is done.
By the normal method we express the output of the reduced cipher as a polynomial of the plaintext . Call the polynomial . Then if we can express with coefficients, then using known distinct pairs, we can construct the polynomial. To verify the guess of the last round key, then check with one extra pair if it holds that
If yes, then with high probability the guess of the last round key was correct. If no, then make another guess of the key.
By the Meet-In-The-Middle method we express the output from round as a polynomial of the plaintext and as a polynomial of the output of the reduced cipher . Call the polynomials and , and let them be expressed by and coefficients, respectively. Then with known distinct pairs we can find the coefficients. To verify the guess of the last round key, then check with one extra pair if it holds that
If yes, then with high probability the guess of the last round key was correct. If no, then make another guess of the key.
Once we have found the correct last round key, then we can continue in a similar fashion on the remaining round keys.
Time complexity
With a secret round key of length , then there are different keys. Each with probability to be correct if chosen at random. Therefore, we will on average have to make guesses before finding the correct key.
Hence, the normal method have average time complexity , requiring known distinct pairs, and the Meet-In-The-Middle method have average time complexity , requiring known distinct pairs.
Real world application
The Meet-in-the-middle attack can be used in a variant to attack S-boxes, which uses the inverse function, because with an -bit S-box then in .
The block cipher SHARK uses SP-network with S-box . The cipher is resistant against differential and linear cryptanalysis after
a small number of rounds. However it was broken in 1996 by Thomas Jakobsen and Lars Knudsen, using interpolation attack. Denote by SHARK a version of SHARK with block size bits using parallel -bit S-boxes in rounds. Jakobsen and Knudsen found that there exist an interpolation attack on SHARK (64-bit block cipher) using about chosen plaintexts, and an interpolation attack on SHARK (128-bit block cipher) using about chosen plaintexts.
Also Thomas Jakobsen introduced a probabilistic version of the interpolation attack using Madhu Sudan's algorithm for improved decoding of Reed-Solomon codes. This attack can work even when an algebraic relationship between plaintexts and ciphertexts holds for only a fraction of values.

Jacques Martin (25 September 1921 – 21 January 2010) was a French comics artist and comic book creator. He was one of the classic artists of Tintin magazine, alongside Edgar P. Jacobs and Hergé, of whom he was a longtime collaborator. He is best known for his series Alix. He was born in Strasbourg.
Biography
After pursuing engineering studies as a young man, Jacques Martin began in 1942 to draw his first comic stories. In 1946, following the end of the War, he travelled through Belgium in search of an editor for his work. Soon afterwards he met Georges Remi (aka Hergé) with whom he collaborated on several albums of The Adventures of Tintin (and more specifically on Tintin in Tibet and The Red Sea Sharks) while working on his own albums. It was from Hergé that he learned of the ligne claire style and, under Hergé's guidance, began to use it in his own work. He would later be considered one of the great five of the ligne claire style, along with Hergé, Edgar P. Jacobs, Bob de Moor and Willy Vandersteen.
In 1948, he created Alix, his most famous series, published in the magazine Tintin, whose adventures - extremely well researched - occur in Roman antiquity. This historic comic soon became one of the most popular of the genre and went on to be published in several countries worldwide.
The story Le spectre de Carthage won the award for best French realistic comic book at the 1978 Angoulême International Comics Festival.
Martin went on to create other characters, beginning with the contemporary journalist Lefranc in 1952. Much later he created others in collaboration with various partners, namely the medieval architect Jhen (initially entitled Xan) in 1978, the French revolutionary officer Arno in 1984, the Athenian Orion in 1990, and the Egyptian Keos in 1992. In 2003, he also started a new series - Loïs set in the court of Louis the sun king of France.
In 1998, due to failing eyesight, Martin left the drawing of Alix to Rafael Morales. Alix continues running with great success. Martin died on 21 January 2010.

In visual arts, a model sheet, also known as a character board, character sheet, character study or simply a study, is a document used to help standardize the appearance, poses, and gestures of a character in arts such as animation, comics, and video games.
Model sheets are required when multiple artists are involved in the production of an animated film, game, or comic to help maintain continuity in characters from scene to scene. In animation, one animator may only do one shot out of the several hundred that are required to complete an animated feature film. A character not drawn according to the production's standardized model is referred to as off-model.
Model sheets are also used for references in 3D modeling to guide proper proportions of models.
Purposes
Model sheets have also been used in the past to maintain graphic continuity over the years for long lasting cartoon productions of short or short features such as the Looney Tunes or Merrie Melodies series.
Model sheets are drawings of posed cartoon or comic strip characters that are created to provide a reference template for several artists who collaborate in the production of a lengthy or multiple-edition work of art such as a comic book, animated film or television series. Model sheets usually depict the character's head and body as they appear at various angles (a process known as "model rotation"), includes sketches of the character's hands and feet, and shows several basic facial expressions.
Model sheets ensure that, despite the efforts of several or many artists, their work exhibits unity, as if one artist created the drawings (that is, they are "on model"). They show the character's structure, proportions, attire, and body language. Often, several sheets are required to depict a character's subtler emotional and physical attitudes.
Depending on the whim of animation direction, deviations from the model may be permitted in the course of final animation; this "tightness" of model is a major distinguishing factor in overall animation style, as it constitutes a tradeoff between expressiveness and smoothness/consistency. As such, the usage of models varies widely between studios and projects.
Model sheets can also be used in the construction of costumes or sculpted figurines.
Specific annotations
Model sheets also provide notes that present specific information about how to develop particular features of the character, such as his or her head shape, hair length and style, size and position of the eyes and the mouth.
Examples
Some model sheets are specific to particular completed or ongoing projects, whereas others are more general and inclusive of a studio's entire collection of characters. Animation studios besides Disney and fans also post model sheets on their Internet Web sites. Larry's Toon Institute provides a generic model sheet for the purpose of introducing the concept of model sheets.
Copyright and fair use
Model sheets are not typically in the public domain, but are copyrighted material owned by the animation studio which created it.
Although model sheets originally are intended for artists who work for the studios that own the characters for which these templates are developed, other artists, such as those who create fan art, profit from them by adapting their characters to their own uses.

Plaza San Martín (English: San Martín Square) is a park located in the Retiro neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Situated at the northern end of pedestrianized Florida Street, the park is bounded by Libertador Ave. (N), Maipú St. (W), Santa Fe Avenue (S), and Leandro Alem Av. (E). Its coordinates are .
History
A succession of colonial Spanish governors had their official residences built on what today is the plaza and, in 1713, the land was sold to the British South Sea Company. The South Sea Company operated their slave trade out of the former governor's residence and a fort and bullring were later built nearby. The land was the site of Gen. John Whitelocke's 1807 defeat upon Britain's second attempt to conquer Buenos Aires, whereby the area became known as the "Field of Glory". The Revolution of 1810 brought an autonomous government to Buenos Aires, which entrusted the Mounted Grenadiers to José de San Martín and allowed him to establish his main barracks at the plaza. An 1813 resolution abolished the slave trade in the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata and the slave quarters were shuttered. Following his decisive military victories, Gen. San Martín was forced into exile in 1824 for political reasons; but a reappraisal of his place in history led to his becoming nearly eponymous in Argentina after his death in 1850. Accordingly, French sculptor Louis-Joseph Daumas was commissioned in 1862 to create an equestrian statue of the hero of the Wars for Independence and the square was renamed in his honor in 1878, upon the hundredth anniversary of his birth.
Following remodeling works by British architect Edward Taylor and Argentine architect José Canale, the fort, bullring and other buildings were demolished in 1883 by order of Mayor Torcuato de Alvear, converting the area into a plaza. Numerous Ombú, Linden and Floss Silk trees were planted. The same administration also shaped the Plaza de Mayo, nearby and in 1889 French urbanist Charles Thays was commissioned to give the plaza its approximate current form (among numerous other designs he left Argentina over the next twenty years). The plaza became the preferred surroundings for some of Argentina's wealthiest landowners around 1900. Three architecturally significant mansions facing the plaza surviving today were the Beaux Arts San Martín Palace (today the ceremonial annex of the Foreign Ministry), the Second Empire Paz Palace (today the Military Officers' Association) and the Neogothic Haedo Palace (today the offices of the National Parks Administration).
The park was the site in 1909 of the inaugural of both the first premier hotel in Argentina (the Plaza) and of the new National Museum of Fine Arts, for which the glass and steel pavilion used at the 1889 World's Fair in Paris was enlisted; structurally inadequate, the pavilion was demolished in 1932, however. Plaza San Martín and its surroundings acquired their current physiognomy in 1936, when Charles Thays' son, Carlos León Thays, designed the esplanade surrounding the monument and when the 33-story Art Deco Kavanagh building was completed. Though the surrounding area has since seen much of its older architecture replaced by high-rises (notably the 1975 Pirelli building), the plaza has remained timeless. Its western section was separated to make way for a rerouting of Maipú Street in 1972; but President Néstor Kirchner ordered the change reverted in 2004, in response to long-standing appeals by neighbours and friends of the park.
Events
In spring 2009 an exhibition of the "United Buddy Bears" was held in the park, for the first on the American continent. The exhibition consisted of more than 140 bear sculptures, each two metres high and designed by a different artist.

Lieutenant John Albert Edward Robertson Daley (5 February 1898 – 8 July 1918) was a British World War I flying ace credited with six aerial victories.
Daley was born in Kingston, Jamaica, the son of George E. Daley of New Market, St. Elizabeth, Jamaica, and attended the Potsdam School. He enlisted on 19 January 1916 as a private in the 2nd Jamaica Battalion, British West Indies Regiment, and on 6 March 1916 he was confirmed as a temporary second lieutenant.
The same day he was one of 25 officers and 1,115 other ranks of the Third Jamaica Contingent who embarked on at Kingston. Due to enemy submarine activity Verdala was routed to England via Halifax, Nova Scotia. En route she ran into a blizzard. Verdala was not properly heated and the soldiers had not been issued with enough warm clothing, causing 600 cases of exposure and frostbite, and five deaths. On arrival at Halifax 106 men were hospitalized.
On 6 April 1917 Daley was appointed a flying officer (observer) in the Royal Flying Corps, with seniority from 27 December 1916, serving in No. 13 Squadron. On 27 December 1917 he was appointed a flying officer, serving in No. 24 Squadron, flying a S.E.5a. Between March and July 1918 he shot down five aircraft and a kite balloon, but was killed in action only a week after his final victory.
Awards
His award of the Distinguished Flying Cross was gazetted a month after his death.
T./Lt. John Albert Edward Robertson Daley (formerly British West Indies Regiment.)
This officer has destroyed five enemy aeroplanes and two kite balloons, displaying marked skill and daring in these several actions, and also in attacking troops close to the ground.

The Manhattan Brewing Company was a brewery founded in Chicago, United States in 1893 which had associations with Al Capone and organized crime during and after prohibition. Manhattan later changed its name to the Canadian Ace Brewing Company and operated as such through the 1950s and 1960s until closing in 1968.
History
The Manhattan Brewing Co. was founded in 1893.
According to the book After Capone, Chicago mobster Johnny Torrio and partner veteran brewing magnate Joseph Stenson (of Stenson Brewing Company) purchased Manhattan in 1919. Not long after the purchase, pal Louis Greenberg (finance man for Al Capone) assumed management responsibilities and held a significant stock position in the brewery. Greenberg was seen as a perfect fit given his experience in the booze businesses and as a money-man.
During Prohibition, Torrio, Greenberg and other underworld elements reorganized the brewery under the Malt Maid name and in 1925 the name was changed to Fort Dearborn Products Company. Beer was produced illegally on the premises, and the brewery was occasionally searched.
In 1932, with pal Greenberg's help, Chicago mob boss Frank Nitti, purchased the brewery. Manhattan returned to regular beer production after prohibition was repealed. In 1933, likely in anticipation of legal 3.2% beer, the name was changed from Fort Dearborn to back to Manhattan.
Up to January, 1936, Manhattan Brewery confined its distribution to the states immediately adjacent to its locale. During that period, "Old Manhattan" was their flagship brand. With the advent of the Keglined beer can, Manhattan dramatically expanded their distribution and brand offerings.
In 1938, Manhattan boasted of being second to the Pabst Brewing Company in canned beer production.
Manhattan had business relationships with many brewing companies. Manhattan records indicate they owned stock in the Prima-Bismarck brewing company, and advanced cash to a number of brewing companies (Food City, Whitewater, Ann Arbor). Manhattan would can and bottle brands under contract for such breweries.
According to After Capone, when Nitti committed suicide in 1943, he owned 85 percent of the stock in Manhattan and also owned an interest in the Prima-Bismark brewing company.
The Manhattan brewery was demolished in 1976.
Organized Crime
Individuals with ties to organized crime had both direct and indirect involvement with the operations of Manhattan. During prohibition, Johnny Torrio was the primary owner, and later Al Capone was associated with illicit activities at the brewery during the Malt Maid Products / Fort Dearborn Products era. During and after the Prohibition era, Lou Greenberg (finance man for Al Capone) was a primary owner and manager of Manhattan. In April, 1933 respectable Arthur Lueder was installed as President.
According to the book After Capone, when Frank Nitti committed suicide in 1943, he owned 85 percent of the stock in Manhattan and also owned an interest in the Prima-Bismark brewing company.
Manhattan had run-ins with federal authorities, mainly for deceptive marketing practices which often suggested beer produced at their brewery in Chicago was produced by different breweries, or in different locations. The ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30 1944 mentions the following case pending in the courts: "Manhattan Brewing Co., Chicago.--Seventh Circuit (Chicago), misleading use of words "Canadian" and "Wisconsin" in brand or trade names for beer or ale not brewed in Canada or Wisconsin." The Canadian (Ace) issue drags on through 1945 and 1946.
Manhattan was also known to pressure the Chicago bartenders union to push Manhattan products.
Athletic sponsorship
The brewery sponsored the Chicago Manhattan Beer soccer team, one of the top midwest teams in the early twentieth century. Such great players as Fabri Salcedo and Billy Gonsalves spent time with the team which won the 1938 Peel Cup and finished runner-up in the 1939 National Challenge Cup.
Breweriana
Besides the link with organized crime, interest in the Manhattan Brewing Company is due to the variety of brands and related breweriana for which they were directly or indirectly responsible. Cans are sought after Manhattan breweriana including the most desired beer can by collectors in existence is that of what was called Tiger Beer. There is only one known example and it is the Holy Grail of collectable beer cans. Although company records indicate many cases were shipped , only one example was ever found
Canadian Ace Brewing Company
Manhattan changed their name to Canadian Ace effective January 2, 1947, and discontinued producing any brands bearing Manhattan in the name. The likely rational was an attempt "clean-up" the post-war image of the brewery by retiring the Manhattan flagship brand and relying upon the well established Canadian Ace brand to be the bellwether for the future.
The link to organized crime remained as Lou Greenberg was a principal owner of the Canadian Ace Brewing Company.
As Canadian Ace, the brewery used various brewery names on their cans matching the label or brand (Essex was Essex Brewery Ltd., Jester was the Jester Brewing Co., and so on. The Canadian Ace produced brewery closed in 1968.

Bonner County is a county in the northern part of the U.S. state of Idaho. As of the 2020 census, the population was 47,110. The county seat and largest city is Sandpoint. Partitioned from Kootenai County and established in 1907, it was named for Edwin L. Bonner, a ferry operator.
Bonner County comprises the Sandpoint, Idaho Micropolitan Statistical Area.
History
Bonner County was formed on February 21, 1907. It was named for travel entrepreneur Edwin L. Bonner, a ferry operator.
In 1864, the Idaho Legislature created the counties of Lah-Toh and Kootenai. Kootenai County initially covered all of present-day Bonner and Boundary counties and a portion of present-day Kootenai County. It also overlapped part of the existing boundary of Shoshone County. Sin-na-ac-qua-teen, a trading post in present-day Bonner County on the south shore of the Pend Oreille River near Laclede, was named county seat. The government of Kootenai failed to organize due to lack of settlement within the county boundary. In 1867, the legislature repealed the act that created the two counties and consolidated them into a county that retained the Kootenai name. Rathdrum became the county seat when Kootenai County organized in 1881.
The tiny portion of Bonner County south of the 48th parallel and east of Shoshone County was not in any of Idaho's counties from 1863 to 1907, the longest time frame any non-county area existed in the State of Idaho. The Idaho panhandle north of the Clearwater River's basin was in Spokane County, Washington, prior to Idaho's creation as a territory in 1863. When Idaho defined its original counties by February, 1864, it attached the former Spokane County area to Nez Perce County for judicial purposes. Legislators creating Kootenai County in December 1864 lacked knowledge of the geography of the area and failed to fully include the non-county area within the county boundaries of Kootenai or Lah-Toh. The non-county area was fully included within Bonner County when it was formed in 1907.
Boundary County was formed from Bonner County in 1915.

Yellowknife Bay is a geologic formation in Gale Crater on the planet Mars. NASA's Mars Science Laboratory rover, named Curiosity, arrived at the low lying depression on December 17, 2012, 125 sols, or Martian days, into its 668-sol planned mission on the planet. Primary mission goals of the Mars Science Laboratory were to assess the potential habitability of the planet and whether or not the Martian environment is, or has ever been, capable of supporting life.
The site was chosen after much study of the region by previous missions. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter observed morphological features created by the presence of liquid water, suggesting the presence of an ancient lake which could have sustained microbial life. The geologic depression takes its name from the city Yellowknife, capital of the Canadian Northwest Territories, in honor of the 4 billion year old rock in the region surrounding the city, which matches the approximate age of the uncovered rock in Gale Crater.
Gale Crater
Yellowknife Bay is a 5-meter geologic depression located in the large impact crater known as Gale Crater. The Crater is located on Mars near the northwestern part of the Aeolis quadrangle just south of the planet's equator. The crater's central feature is a mountain called Aeolis Mons, nicknamed Mount Sharp. Geologic units in the interior of the crater offer a wide range of relative ages of the impact and provide a detailed geologic history of activities within the crater.
Gale Crater is the landing site of the Mars Science Laboratory rover, which was launched from Cape Canaveral on November 26, 2011, and landed at the site designated Bradbury Landing on August 6, 2012. The rover is equipped with a more advanced suite of instruments than has ever landed on an extraterrestrial planet, perfect for assessing the geology of the target regions. From its landing point, Curiosity drove half a kilometer northeast to the low lying depression. A flatter and more lightly colored region than the previous terrain, this region was designated Yellowknife Bay. A top mission priority for the Mars Science Laboratory team was to capture a 360-degree, color panoramic image of this region. This image was then to be used to select drilling locations of the rock samples, John Klein and Cumberland, taken from Yellowknife Bay.
Habitability
Conditions on Mars during its first billion years were dramatically different from the present day. Whether or not the conditions were once habitable depends largely on the volatile content, specifically water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), of the surface. The greatest source of evidence for the presence of these volatiles comes from observations of surface morphologies. Previous observations of Gale Crater show that the strata exposed at Yellowknife Bay are most likely fan or down slope equivalents, such as lacustrine deposits. Curiosity used its ChemCam and Mastcam instruments to analyze the chemistry and layering of a geological outcrop designated as Shaler. This geologic formation displayed cross-bedding features, clear indicators of past interactions with water flows. Yellowknife Bay was chosen by the Mars Science Laboratory team as the first major site for exploration because the exposed strata was inferred to be a shallow fluvial-lacustrine deposit. These aqueous environments are believed to preserve evidence of paleo-habitability and potentially, Earth-like microorganisms capable of breaking down rocks and minerals for energy, known as chemolithoautotrophs.
Until Curiosity had arrived on Mars, all surface age dating of Mars had been through relative techniques using geomorphology and crater counting methods in order to determine an estimated age of the rock layering. The Mars Science Laboratory team used the rover to collect samples from the mudstone at Yellowknife Bay then, using the mass spectrometer, from the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument package
measured argon isotopes for an absolute radiometric date of the rock member, and an approximate age of its exposure to the surface. The age of the lake bed rock was dated to 4 billion years old, and exposed by wind erosion between 30 and 110 million years ago, giving us the first absolute age of a rock on another planet. Still, a more ideal location to search for evidence of life on Mars would have been a member exposed more recently, as few as a million years or less, so it could have been better preserved from the harsh surface radiation.
Yellowknife Bay geology
The primary composition of most terrestrial bodies in our solar system is igneous rock, but it has long been speculated that sedimentary rock exists in great quantity on Mars, as it does on Earth. The Curiosity rover has confirmed the presence of sedimentary rock composed of fine-, medium-, and coarse-grained sandstone basalt. This exposure is about thick and is divided into three unique strata. From bottom to top, these strata have been designated: the Sheepbed Member ( thick), the Gillespie Lake Member ( thick), and the Glenelg Member ( thick); the assemblage of members is known as the Yellowknife Bay formation.
Active erosion, attributed to both aeolian and fluvial events, has caused the Gillespie Lake Member to weather away, revealing the underlying Sheepbed layer and creating a topographic step observable in HiRISE images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The Gillespie Lake bed appears massive and is composed of poorly sorted, angular to well-rounded grains, which make up sheetlike sandstone basalt. These characteristics further support a model of fluvial transport and deposition. In addition, sandstone beds associated with the Gillespie Lake Member seem similar to microbially induced sedimentary structures (MISS) found on Earth, according to one study.
It was from the Sheepbed layer that Curiosity took two drilling samples from the mudstone sedimentary rock. These drill samples were named John Klein and Cumberland and were, respectively, the second and third drilling samples Curiosity retrieved from the martian regolith. The first being an eolian deposit, named Rocknest, sampled from an area to the west of Yellowknife Bay. The two samples were drilled apart and within of the same stratigraphic level.
John Klein and Cumberland samples
A number of different instruments were used by Curiosity in attempts to assess the mineralogy of the mudstone sampled from the Sheepbed strata. The CheMin XRD, Mastcam, Chemcam, alpha particle x-ray spectrometer (APXS), and the Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) were all used to obtain the most complete picture possible of the chemistry and mineralogy of the two samples, which were used to describe the region as a whole.
A large amount of phyllosilicates, clay minerals such as smectite, were found to be major constituents in the two samples. Clay minerals are hydrous aluminum phyllosillicates and form only in the presence of water, further supporting the claim that an ancient crater lake once existed in this region. Other silicates were detected as well, such as the magnesium-rich end-member of olivine called forsterite, pigeonite, plagioclase, augite, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene. These detected minerals are all indicative of a potential mafic source for the origin of the deposition.
After Yellowknife Bay
With the Mars Science Laboratory's primary goal of establishing whether a habitable paleo-environment could have existed on Mars accomplished while within Yellowknife Bay, the team of NASA scientists then directed Curiosity out of the Yellowknife Bay formation and toward the original destination of Mount Sharp, which rises from the base of Gale Crater. On July 4, 2013, Curiosity drove away from the Glenelg Member and began its journey to Mount Sharp. ASA scientists estimated this drive would take the rover a year to complete.

The 1st Missouri Infantry was an infantry regiment that served in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. Originally commanded by Colonel John S. Bowen, the regiment fought at the Battle of Shiloh, where it was engaged near the Peach Orchard on April 6, 1862. On April 7, during the Union counterattacks at Shiloh, the regiment was instrumental in preventing the Washington Artillery from being captured. The regiment was next engaged at the Second Battle of Corinth, where it outflanked several Union positions. On the second day at Corinth, the regiment was only minimally engaged. On November 7, the 1st Missouri Infantry was combined with the 4th Missouri Infantry to form the 1st and 4th Missouri Infantry (Consolidated), as a result of heavy battle losses in both regiments.
Organization
The regiment was the first Missouri unit to officially enter the Confederate States Army. After recruiting efforts by Colonel John S. Bowen, who had been captured during the Camp Jackson affair, in early June 1861, the unit was officially mustered on June 22, near Memphis, Tennessee. Bowen was the regiment's first colonel, Lucius L. Rich was appointed the first lieutenant colonel, and Charles C. Campbell was the first major. Some of the men recruited were from outside of Missouri, including many from Memphis and New Orleans, Louisiana. Most of the Missourians were from St. Louis or the Missouri Bootheel area. The company organization at the date of organization was:
Company A: New Orleans, Louisiana and St. Louis, Missouri. Commanded by J. Kemp Sprague
Company B: St. Louis, Missouri. Commanded by Robert J. Duffy
Company C: Memphis, Tennessee, and St. Louis, Missouri. Commanded by David Hirsch.
Company D: St. Louis, Missouri. Commanded by Martin Burke
Company E: Mississippi County, Missouri, New Madrid County, Missouri, and St. Louis, Missouri. Commanded by Olin F. Rice
Company F: St. Louis, Missouri. Commanded by Hugh A. Garland
Company G: Pemiscot County, Missouri. Commanded by John A. Gordon.
Company H: New Madrid County, Missouri, and Pemiscot County, Missouri. Commanded by Tilford Hogan.
Company I: New Madrid County, Missouri. Commanded by Thomas J. Phillips.
Company K: Pemiscot County, Missouri. Commanded by John E. Averill.
Service
1861
In August 1861, the regiment was transferred from the Memphis area to New Madrid, Missouri, where it was part of the force of Brigadier General Gideon Pillow. While at New Madrid, the regiment became known for its skill at drill. In September, the unit was again transferred, this time to Columbus, Kentucky. The regiment was issued weapons on September 23. In late December, the regiment was sent to Bowling Green, Kentucky.
1862
Shiloh
After the Battle of Fort Donelson in early 1862, the regiment participated in the destruction of Confederate property during the abandonment of Nashville, Tennessee. The 1st Missouri then joined General Albert Sidney Johnston's Army of Mississippi. The regiment was stationed at Corinth, Mississippi, for some time. Bowen was promoted to brigadier general on March 14, and was replaced as regimental commander by Lieutenant Colonel Rich, who was officially promoted to colonel on April 1. In early April 1862, the 1st Missouri was part of Brigadier General John C. Breckinridge's Reserve Corps of Johnston's army, and would be in Bowen's brigade along with the 9th Arkansas Infantry, 10th Arkansas Infantry, 2nd Confederate Infantry, Hudson's Mississippi Battery, Watson's Louisiana Battery, and a company of Kentucky cavalry.
On April 6, the first day of the Battle of Shiloh, the 1st Missouri and the rest of Bowen's brigade attacked a Union defensive position known as the Peach Orchard. After heaving fighting, the Confederate charge drove the Union troops from the Peach Orchard, although Johnston was mortally wounded during the fighting. On April 7, the 1st Missouri participated in the Confederate defense against Union counterattacks, and played a significant role in preventing the capture of a portion of the Washington Artillery. Eventually, the Confederate army retreated from the battlefield, and the 1st Missouri was part of the army's rear guard on the march back to Corinth. At Shiloh, the regiment lost 48 men killed, 130 wounded, and 29 missing, for a total of 207; the regiment had begun the battle with around 850 men. Colonel Rich had been wounded on April 6; he died on August 9. Lieutenant Colonel Amos Camden Riley replaced Rich at the head of the regiment; Riley was officially promoted to colonel on August 2.
Corinth
After the Confederates abandoned Corinth in the summer of 1862, the 1st Missouri was transferred to the Vicksburg, Mississippi, area. The regiment, as well as the rest of Bowen's brigade, was expected to be part of the Confederate assault at the Battle of Baton Rouge, but arrived too late for the fighting. By early October, the 1st Missouri was part of Major General Earl van Dorn's Army of West Tennessee. The regiment was part of Bowen's brigade of Major General Mansfield Lovell's division. Bowen's brigade also contained the 6th Mississippi Infantry, 15th Mississippi Infantry, 22nd Mississippi Infantry, Caruther's Mississippi Battalion, and Watson's Louisiana Battery. On October 3, at the Second Battle of Corinth, the 1st Missouri was part of the Confederate assault on the Union's outer defensive works. The 1st Missouri, along with the 33rd Mississippi Infantry, broke the line of the 15th Michigan Infantry, contributing to the collapse of the initial Union line. During the fighting, the 1st Missouri became separated from the rest of Bowen's brigade, and fought with the brigade of Brigadier General John C. Moore for the rest of the day. The 1st Missouri outflanked a Union position commanded by Brigadier General John McArthur, helping Moore's brigade break the line. Moore's brigade then ran against Union reinforcements commanded by Colonel Marcellus Crocker. The 1st Missouri outflanked the 15th Iowa Infantry, which, accompanied by Moore's primary assault on Crocker's line, led to the collapse of the Union position. However, Moore's brigade was not reinforced, and the Confederate assault died down. The next day, Bowen's brigade was only briefly engaged during Confederate attacks on the stronger interior Union position, as Lovell's division was mostly inactive on October 4.
The regiment reported a total loss of seven men at Corinth, although historian James McGhee believes this total is incomplete. The 1st Missouri was part of the Confederate rear guard after Corinth, and participated in skirmishing. On November 7, the 1st Missouri and the 4th Missouri Infantry were combined, as both regiments had suffered heavy losses. The new regiment was known as the 1st and 4th Missouri Infantry (Consolidated). After the consolidation, the Missourians joined the First Missouri Brigade. Colonel Riley commanded the new regiment. Companies A, D, F, G, and K of the 1st and 4th (Consolidated) were from the 1st Missouri, while Companies B, C, E, H, and I were from the 4th.
Legacy
The 1st and 4th Missouri Infantry (Consolidated), which contained many men from the 1st, was assigned to the First Missouri Brigade. The new regiment was engaged in several battles in the 1863 Vicksburg campaign, including the Battle of Champion Hill. In 1864, the regiment fought at the battles of New Hope Church and Kennesaw Mountain in the Atlanta campaign, and saw further action at the Battle of Allatoona. After suffering heavy casualties at the Battle of Franklin, the regiment was transferred to Mobile, Alabama, where it surrendered at the Battle of Fort Blakely on April 9.
Over the life of the regiment before the consolidation, about 1,045 men fought in the regiment; 338 of the regiment's men died while serving with the regiment. Of the deaths, 141 were related to combat.
Commanders
Before the consolidation with the 4th Missouri, the 1st Missouri was commanded by Colonels Bowen, Rich, and Riley. Rich and Riley also served as lieutenant colonels before their promotions. Campbell and Garland were the regiment's majors. After the consolidation, the 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated) was commanded by Riley and Garland. Garland had served as lieutenant colonel for the regiment previously, and the consolidated regiment's majors were Garland and Bradford Keith.

Plot
The story revolves around Hania ( Armeena Rana Khan), an innocent unmarried girl who is full of life. She is a typical young girl who has been spoiled by her parents, mostly her mom (Saba Faisal). She gets anything she asks for and loves to shop! Despite being wealthy, she and her family shift to a house on rent. Hania, due to her bubbly nature, quickly becomes friends with a girl Aina (Madiha Zaidi) who's her neighbor. She visits Aina's house very often and when she comes across her brother Hamza (Adnan Siddiqui) she starts having feelings for him. Hania starts to become very serious about Hamza but he on the other hand doesn't seem to even take notice of her. Basically they are two opposites. Hamza is a serious, practical, and mature guy while Hania isn't. Hania tells her mom how much she's in love with Hamza and wants to marry him.
Hania's mother takes the word materialism to a whole new level! Since Hamza and his family are not financially as sound, she keeps forcing her to not make the "mistake" of marrying him. "Aap ke sar pe tou ishq ka bhoot sawaar hai. Aap bohat barri ghalati kar rahi hain Haniaa!!" says her mom. Hania doesn't change her mind and married to him.
Hania has been treated like a princess all her life and she expects the same treatment from Hamza and his family too. But Hamza has a lot of responsibilities of his family already and doesn't have the resources to treat Hania that way, but promises to keep her happy despite that too. But little does he know, just happiness is not what Hania's mom wants for her. Hania at this point argues with her mom that she's happy with Hamza, but her mom keeps forcing her that he hasn't given her enough "gold jewelry" or money so she can't be happy.
To cut a very long story short, Hania's mom was never in favor of Hamza becoming her son in law so she goes to every extent to ruin Hania's happiness. Hania also starts doubting Hamza's cousin Aaliya as she finds out that she used to like him a long time ago yet she had no intentions of creating problems for the two. Hania's mom however fills her brain with so many false accusations about Hamza and Aaliya that she eventually starts hating them. Her mom becomes so successful in her plan that she causes the two to get divorced.
Hania was expecting at the time of their divorce so she threatens Hamza to kill the child but it was only a threat. After the divorce Hania and her family shift to another house to help Hania start a new life. She gets blessed with a baby girl whom she hides from Hamza, but later he finds out about it and files a case to take her custody, but fails. Hania's mom had always wanted Hania to marry Faisal who happens to be her bhabi's cousin. Of course, Faisal is rich. Hania starts working and ignores Emaan (her daughter). When Hamza finds out he tells Hania to either give proper time and care to Emaan or to hand her over to him forever and then go marry Faisal. Hania has yet to decide what option she's going to pick!

Alberto Machimbarrena Aguirrebengoa (31 March 1888 – 19 July 1923) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder.
Biography
During his career he alternated between two clubs: hometown team Real Sociedad and Real Madrid, known at the time as Madrid FC. While he played for Real Madrid, he was also studying architecture in the Spanish capital.
He became the leader of Real Madrid, captaining the team which won the Copa del Rey in 1917. He played for Real Madrid in eight official matches, all of them in the Copa del Rey, without scoring. For Real Sociedad he played 30 official matches between 1910 and 1922.
After retirement, in 1922, he returned to play some matches for Real Sociedad, which was in need of footballers.
He died prematurely in 1923 in Guadarrama (Madrid), because of tuberculosis.
In 1925, a statue of Machimbarrena and Sotero Aranguren (a Real Madrid teammate, who also died prematurely) was erected at the entrance of the team's dressing room at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.

Kassapa Buddha (Pāli), known as Kāśyapa (काश्यप) in Sanskrit, is one of the ancient Buddhas whose biography is chronicled in chapter 24 of the Buddhavamsa, one of the books of the Pāli Canon.
According to Theravāda Buddhist tradition, Kassapa is the twenty-seventh of the twenty-nine named Buddhas, the sixth of the Seven Buddhas of Antiquity, and the third of the five Buddhas of the present kalpa.
The present kalpa is called a mahabhadrakalpa (great auspicious aeon). The five Buddhas of the present kalpa are:
Kakusandha (the first Buddha of the bhadrakalpa)
Koṇāgamana (the second Buddha of the bhadrakalpa)
Kassapa (the third Buddha of the bhadrakalpa)
Gautama (the fourth and present Buddha of the bhadrakalpa)
Maitreya (the fifth and future Buddha of the bhadrakalpa)
Life
Kassapa was born in Isipatana Deer Park. This place is located in Varanasi, a city in the modern-day state of Uttar Pradesh in northern India. His parents were the Brahmadatta and Dhanavatī.
According to legend, his body was twenty cubits high, and he lived for two thousand years in three different palaces. They are Hamsa, Yasa, and Sirinanda. (The BuA.217 calls the first two palaces Hamsavā and Yasavā). His chief wife was Sunandā, who bore him a son named Vijitasena.
Kassapa gave up his worldly life travelling in his palace. He practiced austerities for only seven days. Just before attaining enlightenment, he accepted a meal of milk-rice from his wife and grass for his seat from a yavapālaka named Soma. His Bodhi tree (the tree under which he attained enlightenment) was a banyan, and he preached his first sermon at Isipatana to an assembly of monks who had renounced the world in his company.
Kassapa performed the Twin Miracle at the foot of an asana tree outside Sundar Nagar. He held only one assembly of his disciples; among his most famous conversions was that of Nāradeva, a Yaksha. His chief disciples among monks were Tissa and Bhāradvāja, and among nuns were Anulā and Uruvelā, his attendant being Sabbamitta. Among his patrons, the most eminent were Sumangala and Ghattīkāra, Vijitasenā, and Bhaddā.
Kassapa died at the age of sixteen thousand years, in the city of Kashi, in the Kashi Kingdom (now known as Varanasi, in the modern-day Indian state of Uttar Pradesh). Over his relics was raised a stupa one league in height, each brick of which was worth one crore (ten million) rupees.
The Stupa of Kassapa Buddha
There was initially a great difference of opinion on what should be the size of the stupa and of what material it should be built. Construction of the stupa was begun after these issues were finally settled. But then the citizens found they lacked sufficient funds to complete the stupa. An anāgāmi devotee named Sorata travelled throughout Jambudvipa, requesting money from the people for the completion of the stupa. He sent the money as he received it, and on hearing that the work was completed, he set out to go and worship the stupa. However, he was seized by robbers and murdered in the forest, which later came to be known as the Andhavana.
Upavāna, in a previous birth, became the guardian deity of the stupa, hence his great majesty in his last life (DA.ii.580; for another story of the building of the shrine see DhA.iii.29).
Among the thirty-seven goddesses noticed by Guttila when he visited heaven was one who had offered a scented five-spray at the stupa (J.ii.256). Alāta offered āneja-flowers and obtained a happy rebirth (J.vi.227).
The cause of Mahākāśyapa's golden complexion was his gift of a golden brick to the building of Kassapa's shrine (AA.i.116).
At the same stupa, Anuruddha, who was then a householder in Varanasi, offered butter and molasses in brass bowls, which were placed without any interval around the stupa (AA.i.105).

The men's discus throw event at the 2000 Summer Olympics as part of the athletics program was held at the Olympic Stadium on Sunday, 24 September and Monday, 25 September. Forty-five athletes from 28 nations competed. The event was won by Virgilijus Alekna of Lithuania, the nation's second victory in the men's discus throw. Lars Riedel of Germany took silver, becoming the 13th man to win multiple discus throw medals. Frantz Kruger earned South Africa's first medal in the event with his bronze.
The qualifying athletes progressed through to the final where the qualifying distances are scrapped and they start afresh with up to six throws. The qualifying distance was 64.00 metres. For all qualifiers who did not achieve the standard, the remaining spaces in the final were filled by the longest throws until a total of 12 qualifiers.
Background
This was the 24th appearance of the event, which is one of 12 athletics events to have been held at every Summer Olympics. The top nine finishers from the 1996 Games all returned, along with the last finalist: gold medalist Lars Riedel and sixth-place finisher Jürgen Schult of Germany, silver medalist Vladimir Dubrovshchik and bronze medalist Vasiliy Kaptyukh of Belarus, fourth-place finisher Anthony Washington and twelfth-place finisher Adam Setliff of the United States, fifth-place finisher Virgilijus Alekna and eighth-place finisher Vaclavas Kidykas of Lithuania, seventh-place finisher Vitaliy Sidorov of Ukraine, and ninth-place finisher Alexis Elizalde of Cuba. Schult was the world record holder and had medaled twice before (gold in 1988, silver in 1992). Riedel had won four of the last five world championships; Washington had won the latest. But Alekna had the best results in 2000 so far, hitting the second- and third-best throws to date (Schult's 1986 record still stands as of 2020).
Turkmenistan and Qatar each made their debut in the men's discus throw. The United States made its 23rd appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the boycotted 1980 Games.
Qualification
Each National Olympic Committee was permitted to enter up to three athletes that had thrown 63.50 metres or further during the qualification period. The maximum number of athletes per nation had been set at 3 since the 1930 Olympic Congress. If an NOC had no athletes that qualified under that standard, one athlete that had thrown 62.00 metres or further could be entered.
Competition format
The competition used the two-round format introduced in 1936, with the qualifying round completely separate from the divided final. In qualifying, each athlete received three attempts; those recording a mark of at least 64.00 metres advanced to the final. If fewer than 12 athletes achieved that distance, the top 12 would advance. The results of the qualifying round were then ignored. Finalists received three throws each, with the top eight competitors receiving an additional three attempts. The best distance among those six throws counted.
Records
Prior to the competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.
No new world or Olympic records were set during the competition.

"Om" is a song by the British progressive rock band the Moody Blues that was released in July 1968 as the final track of their album In Search of the Lost Chord. It was composed by the band's keyboardist, Mike Pinder. "Om" has a heavy Indian influence and sound to it.
The word "Om", which is chanted repeatedly throughout the song, represents Aum, a sacred mantra in the Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Buddhist religions.
On the album, "Om" is preceded by a short spoken-word interlude titled "The Word". "The Word" was written by drummer Graeme Edge and is recited by Pinder. "The Word" explains the album's concept, and that the mantra "Om" is the lost chord referenced in the album's title, which concludes with:
To name the chord is important to some.
So they give it a word,
And the word is "Om"
Like many of the album's preceding tracks, "Om" make use of a variety of instruments. "Om" features both Pinder and Ray Thomas on lead vocals, and playing their usual instruments, Mellotron and flute, respectively. The remaining band members are featured on instrument other than their usual instruments, which includes Justin Hayward on sitar, John Lodge on cello, and Graeme Edge on tabla, a popular Indian percussion instrument used in the classical, popular and devotional music of the Indian subcontinent and in Hindustani classical music.
"Om" is one of several songs in the raga rock style on In Search of the Lost Chord. It has a very similar influence and sound to "Within You Without You", which was written by George Harrison and included on the Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
While "The Word" and "Om" are generally played together, "The Word" was released on the band's 1974 compilation This Is The Moody Blues without "Om". However, the final word of "The Word", which is also the first word of "Om", was included.
Personnel
Mike Pinder – lead vocals, tambura, Mellotron, mantra chant
Ray Thomas – lead vocals, flute, mantra chant
Justin Hayward – sitar, acoustic guitar, backing vocals, mantra chant
John Lodge – cello, bass, backing vocals, mantra chant

Crescent Toys was a British toy manufacturing company in operation from 1922 to 1980.
Overview
Crescent Toys manufactured lead [hollow-cast] figures and animals, die cast metal vehicles, toy guns, hollow cast and later plastic figures and toy soldiers of various historical periods. The firm was founded by Henry Eagles and Arthur Schneider and was located at 67, DeBeauvoir Crescent, Kingston Road, London.
Henry George Eagles was one of seven children born of William Eagles, a lifebelt maker, and his wife Emily. At some point in the 1930s, one of Henry's brothers, Arthur, joined the Company under the name of Mr. Harvey (to avoid suspicion of nepotism) and worked as a foreman in the lead casting shop. It was understood that during the early part of the Second World War, Arthur Schneider went to America because of the connotation with Germany that his surname gave. Henry's health deteriorated and Arthur (Harvey) carried more of the responsibility of running the factory aided by Doris Eagles, one of Henry's four children. Henry, known to most of us as 'Harry', died in 1942 and his brother, my father, known as Mr. Harvey, continued to manage the business, which by now was manufacturing munitions' parts. At the end of the war, Henry's two sons, Harry and Ernie, who had served in the armed forces, joined Crescent along with their younger brother Frank and they together with their sister Doris, the Company Secretary, held the controlling interest.
History
Mr. Harvey was given 1,000 shares in Crescent Toy for his caretaker role and purchased a house of some standing in Potter Street, Essex. Die Cast Machine Tools, a small company in Green Lanes, Palmers Green had supplied Crescent with Die Casting Machines and took on casting work subcontracted from them. They soon realised that there was more to be made from selling the finished product than just the parts. In consequence, they used what knowledge they had gained to become fierce competitors in every field that they could.
Meanwhile, with an eye to the development grants then available for industry to move to Wales, Crescent decided to open a factory and my father spent over two years travelling to, and working in, Cwmcarn until the factory was opened in 1949. His co-directors, my cousins, loved Wales and all decided to shut the Tottenham factory and move there. Having spent two years in an area where he said the rain came at you horizontally, dad said he wouldn't move but would continue in Tottenham and supply Crescent with toys cheaper than they would be able to make them in Wales.
Discord between the families got rather bitter and 'Mr. Harvey' set up The Harvey Toy Company in Commerce Road, Wood Green, in the name given to him by his brother many years before. He then sought an alliance with the old enemy - Die Casting Machine Tools - who by then were Trading as Lone Star Products, Californian Screen Blocks, A.G.M. Industries, and several other names. His House in Potter Street had to go and we moved to Abbey Road in Bush Hill Park. Of his three children, Ronald, the youngest, worked in Lone Star's Tool Room alongside 'Smith & Odell' (later of 'Matchbox' fame) my Brother Anthony eventually went into the 'Church', and I ran a Rotational Moulding and Vacuum Forming Company and in more recent years developed a plastics assembly process marketed as PHASA.
The Toy Soldier and Toy Gun Markets seemed as though they were really killed off in America as a consequence of the Vietnam War
Prior to the war, Crescent acquired moulds and stock from C.W. Baker which traded as Reka. Crescent manufactured a series of dioramas depicting various shops and a classroom from 1950s Britain. The company also manufactured Dan Dare sets of figures and Thunderbirds toys.

Helena Czaplińska (died 1651), was the second wife of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, Hetman of Zaporizhian Host (r. 1648–1657). She was an influential figure among the Ukrainian Cossacks and known as "Helen of the Steppe". Initially married to Daniel Czapliński, her influence was seen as a threat as she was suspected to betray her second husband the hetman in favor of her loyalties of her former marriage. She was famously executed for treason by her stepson Tymofiy Khmelnytsky during the absence of her spouse.

The Dial Press was a publishing house founded in 1923 by Lincoln MacVeagh.
The Dial Press shared a building with The Dial and Scofield Thayer worked with both. The first imprint was issued in 1924.
Authors included Elizabeth Bowen, W. R. Burnett and Glenway Wescott, Frank Yerby, James Baldwin, Roy Campbell, Susan Berman, Herbert Gold, Thomas Berger, Vance Bourjaily, Judith Rossner, and Norman Mailer.
In 1963, Dell Publishing Company acquired 60% of the Dial Press stock but the Press remained an independent subsidiary. It was jointly owned by Richard Baron and Dell Publishing; E. L. Doctorow was editor-in-chief. In 1969 the Dial Press became wholly owned by Dell Publishing Company. In 1976 Doubleday bought Dell Publishing and the children's division of Dial Press (Dial Books for Young Readers) was sold to E. P. Dutton. The children's division of Dial Press published books under the Pied Piper imprint. Dutton would be bought by New American Library, which in turn became a part of the Penguin Group, a division of Pearson PLC. When the Penguin Group obtained the rights to children's books published by the Dial Press, some were published in paperback under the imprint Puffin Pied Piper (because Puffin has been the longtime paperback imprint for the Penguin Group). Doubleday dissolved Dial Press in 1985. The adult imprint was revived by Carole Baron the publisher of Dell at the time part of Bantam/Doubleday/Dell under the leadership of Susan Kamil. It went on to gain awards and bestsellers. It was bought when BDD was sold to Random House. Penguin and Random House merged in 2013, forming Penguin Random House, with the main division part of Random House and the Young Readers division part of Penguin.

A tremulant (from Latin: tremulus, "trembling"; , , ) is a device on a pipe organ which varies the wind supply to the pipes of one or more divisions (or, in some cases, the whole organ). This causes their amplitude and pitch to fluctuate, producing a tremolo and vibrato effect. A large organ may have several tremulants, affecting different ranks (sets) of pipes. Many tremulants are variable, allowing for the speed and depth of tremolo to be controlled by the organist. The tremulant has been a part of organ building for many centuries, dating back to Italian organs of the sixteenth century.
The tremulant should not be confused with the celeste, which consists of two distinct ranks of pipes, one tuned slightly sharp or flat from the other, producing an undulating effect when they are used together.
Construction
The simplest kind of tremulant is a weighted electric motor affixed to the top of the reservoir for the division. When activated, the spinning of the motor causes the reservoir to shake, altering the wind pressure. This type of tremolo appeared first in the twentieth century, when the electric motor became available.
The tremblant fort (French: "strong tremulant") allows an escape route for some of the wind in the wind trunk. The loss of wind creates the tremulant effect.
The tremblant doux (French: "sweet tremulant") was illustrated by Dom Bédos de Celles in his monumental L'art du facteur d'orgues. It consists of a spring-loaded flap that is mounted inside the wind trunk of a division. When the tremulant is engaged, the flap drops into the wind trunk and bounces as the wind passes by it. The spring allows the flap to rebound repeatedly back into the wind supply, which creates the undulation. Both the tremblant fort and the tremblant doux were commonly seen on German organs of the 17th and 18th centuries.
Austin Organs, Inc. builds a proprietary kind of tremulant for its Universal Windchest. The Austin tremulant consists of a large blade that spans the length of the windchest above the pipes. When the tremulant is activated, the blade turns on its longitudinal axis, disturbing the air over the sounding pipes and creating a tremulant effect. It does not affect the air pressure of the pipes. Normal tremulants cause pipes to go out of tune quicker.

[Sound] "Very quiet and effective."
[Mechanism] "The tremulant copied from memory from the one in the Paul Fritts organ at Notre Dame University. This tremulant gets its wind directly from a valve on the main bifurcation windline, through a 1" copper tube about 6" long. It is almost identical to the one in the organ in Marquand Chapel, Yale University."

Chinese Poetry Congress () is an ongoing game show on China Central Television that tests competitors' memory and reciting of Chinese poetry, including classical and modern forms of shi, ci and qu. It is related to several other game shows such as Chinese Characters Dictation Competition and Chinese Idioms Congress.
Opening poetry
Every episode of the show starts with quotations from a piece of classical Chinese poetry. In the first season ten pieces were quoted. Note: the following pinyin tones show original, or standard pronunciation, not including tone sandhis on special syllables.
In the second season, the off-stage contestants no longer read poems, and the presenter of the show read instead.
Gameplay
The show follows a two-part game. In the first part, there are 105 contestants competing, 5 that have done best in the previous episode on stage and 100 off stage (called "百人团", lit. a hundred people team). The ones on stage select their set of ten questions one by one, and answer them in order. Off-stage contestants answers simultaneously on iPads. If they answer correctly in 10 seconds, the number of other participants that answers incorrectly adds to their score, otherwise their game is over. When a contestant's score surpasses another's, the latter is eliminated.
The second part sees the best of the five challenging the contestant that has done best during the season, and they have to answer a series of more tough questions in order to win the challenge. One such segment is the fei hua ling (飞花令, lit. "flying flower game"), a section where the two contestants must constantly think of and recite verses that contain a particular character or reference a particular theme. The intensity of this section has contributed to the show's popularity.
The second season introduces a more "reasonable" gameplay: every episode four contestants are selected from the hundred-contestants team, and follow part one from the first season; then the best of them has to challenge the fastest and most correct off-stage contestant to decide who would be the best of the episode, and may accept challenge from people that competes later. The first four contestants (in the opening episode) were chosen as the best performers of a non-broadcast written test and subsequent auditions.
In the fourth season, the questions are related to a certain keyword. If a contestant answers a question wrong, he or she is given a 'redemption' opportunity through succeeding any of 3 challenges: completing a game of fei hua ling against 12 other participants from the entire off-stage participant panel, answering guessing game-style questions about poetry, or managing to recite one verse relating every of 12 given themes. The challenge for the contestant is chosen randomly. This opportunity is not presented on the second incorrect answer.
Question format
Round 1
The first round contains nine questions:
Identify the line. Choose the correct characters from 9 or 12 characters to form a line of a poem.
Missing character/line. Fill in the missing character or complete the missing line.
Multiple choice.
Round 2
Each of the two contestants must alternatively give two poem lines, containing a chosen character. The game ends when one of the two contestants cannot name another sentence.
Championship Round
Winner of Round 2 and the returning champion play a best-of-nine final, all the questions are on the buzzer. The first 3 questions are related to drawings, where contestants are required to identify a line related to the paintting. The next 6 questions are guessing questions related to four cues. 1 point will be given for each correct answer, and for each wrong answer, the opponent score. First to score 5 points will be determined as the champion, and return for the next episode.
Cast
Presenter
The presenter of Chinese Poetry Congress is Dong Qing, known for co-hosting CCTV New Year's Gala for years. She serves as both a host and a narrator. During a re-recording, Dong, by accident, fell off the stage and hurt her kneecap; however she insisted to continue recording under a cold compression, and eventually completed the show. Dong also performed reciting a poem in Shanghainese, singing Su Shi's Shui diao ge tou, and quoting numerous Chinese idioms on air.
Judges
Li Bo () is a Nanjing Normal University literature professor, having been giving lessons at CCTV's Lecture Room, a program on which scholars share their works and make statements of various subjects. Li was also a judge on Chinese Idioms Congress.
Meng Man () is a master-advisor of Minzu University of China, working on ancient Chinese women. Meng was also a lecturer on Lecture Room and a judge on Chinese Idioms Congress.
Wang Liqun () is a Henan University professor and Doctor-advisor and a pioneer on studying ancient Chinese literature and culture.
Kang Zhen () is a Beijing Normal University professor and Doctor-advisor.
The Hundred Contestants Team
The people that answer questions off-stage are from all walks of life such as teachers, students, peasants and the police, not restricted to Chinese residents. The age ranges from 7 to 55. They follow the narrator's reciting opening poetry and count to the points that an on-stage contestant gets if their answer is incorrect. Due to the limited time of 10 seconds to answer on a tablet computer, a large quantity of contestants failed to complete verses that are usually taught in China's primary schools, for example Meng Haoran's Ode to the Willow (), leading to criticism on the team, as they were described as "The regular studio audience".
In the fourth season, the team is divided into four groups: children, teenage students, workingpeople from various employments, and duos (formed from friends, family, lovers, or other close relations).
Awards
In the 22nd Shanghai Television Festival, Chinese Poetry Congress is awarded the best variety show.

Esther Caukin Brunauer (July 7, 1901 – June 26, 1959) was a longtime employee of the American Association of University Women (AAUW) and then a U.S. government civil servant, who with her husband was targeted by Senator Joseph McCarthy's campaign against U.S. State Department officials whose loyalty to the U.S. he questioned.
Early years
Esther Delia Caukin was born on July 7, 1901, near Jackson, California, to parents born in California. Her father, an electrician, had left-wing political views. Her mother worked as a clerk, supported women's suffrage, and campaigned for Woodrow Wilson in 1914. The family moved frequently during Esther's childhood. She graduated from Girls' High School in San Francisco in 1920 and then attended Mills College, graduating with a B.A. in history in 1924. She earned a doctorate from Stanford University in 1927, financing her education in part with a fellowship from the American Association of University Women (AAUW). She moved to Washington, D.C., to work on the AAUW staff and headed its international affairs program until 1944.
Marriage
Esther Caukin married Stephen Brunauer (1903-1986) on July 8, 1931. He was an immigrant to the U.S. from Hungary, trained as a chemist, who had belonged to the Young Workers' League, a Communist front, until 1927. In the 1930s he worked as a research scientist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. During World War II he joined the U.S. Naval Reserve and led its high explosives research group. He gained the rank of commander before changing his status to that of a civilian employee of the U.S. Navy in 1944. The Atomic Energy Commission denied him a security clearance because of his earlier membership in the Young Workers' League, but he continued to work as a scientist for the U.S. Navy.
The Brunauers had a son who lived only a few months in 1934 and two daughters who were born in 1938 and 1942.
American Association of University Women
The Brunauers spent time in Germany on fellowships in 1933, during the Nazi seizure of power. Returning to the U.S., Esther Brunauer became an advocate for collective security in opposition to the pacifism of many women's rights advocates of the period. She headed a National Defense Study Commission that published a study of national defense in 1937 that the U.S. Chief of Naval Operations assessed in 1950 as "largely responsible for converting various pacifist organizations in this country and thus making possible an immediate program of rearmament". On behalf of the AAUW, she became a key figure in such organizational alliances as the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies and the Women's Action Committee for Victory and Lasting Peace. She campaigned on behalf of the AAUW for the relaxation of the U.S. Neutrality Acts. In 1941 she authored an attack on isolationism and appeasement, "Relationship of Foreign Policy to National Defense", that said:
State Department
Brunauer joined the U.S. State Department in March 1944 where she was responsible for international organizational affairs. She first worked on planning for post-war international cooperation, helping draft plans for the United Nations and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). In 1945 she served as an adviser to the U.S. delegation at the conference that founded the United Nations. She was promoted to the rank of minister, the third U.S. woman to hold that State Department rank, and represented the U.S. at preparatory meetings of UNESCO and several of its overseas conferences.
The isolationist Chicago Tribune criticized Esther Bruanuer for her internationalism as early as 1941. In 1947, Representative Fred Busbey attacked her by name when denouncing "pro-Communist fellow travelers and muddle heads" in the State Department. She passed a government security review in 1948. In 1950, when Senator Joseph McCarthy launched the anti-Communist crusade known by his name, he identified her as one of the State Department employees whose disloyalty he could prove. On March 13, 1950, when he narrowed his suspects from his early list of 81, he included her as one of nine he named to the Senate's Subcommittee on the Investigation of Loyalty of State Department Employees, commonly known as the Tydings Committee, which was investigating his charges. Among her defenders were Eleanor Lansing Dulles, a State Department official from a politically prominent family. and several AAUW officials. Milton Eisenhower wrote a letter in support of her, as did her neighbor former U.S. Senator Joe Ball, a Minnesota Republican, who wrote that Brunauer was "perhaps the most violently anti-Communist person I know".
Brunauer herself had long supported the government's loyalty-security review program. In 1948 she had written:
Testifying in front of the committee, she reported receiving anonymous telephone calls with "death threats and profanity". She said: "My husband is a loyal American ... an outspoken foe of Communism. I am a loyal American. I am not a Communist. I have never engaged in Communist activities. I never had any sympathy for a doctrine which conflicts with the basic principles of our American democracy." The committee exonerated her in July, but she found some of her activities at the State Department curtailed.
During her husband's years of federal government service, he had passed four security clearance investigations. In April 1951, while working as a high explosives expert, the U.S. Navy suspended his security clearance to conduct another review. As a consequence, the State Department suspended his wife and subjected her to another security review along with him. Stephen resigned from the Navy rather than allowed himself to be found disloyal or labelled a security risk. Esther persisted with the review and was forced from the State Department on June 16, 1952. News of her ouster only became public several months later. She showed the press the letter that said the action was based on the fact that she was a "security risk" but did not specify the grounds for that determination. She said she thought the "official reason" was her marriage but the real reason was "political expediency". She said she hoped the incoming Eisenhower administration would review the federal government's loyalty-security program "fearlessly and thoroughly".
She once commented on the role of gender in her loyalty-security review after facing an all-male panel:
Later years
After leaving government service, she worked briefly for the Library of Congress and then relocated with her husband to Evanston, Illinois, in September 1952. She worked as associate director of the Film Council of America and then in publishing at Rand McNally and Follett Publishing. She died of a heart condition in Evanston on June 26, 1959.

Sir Aulay MacAulay of Ardincaple (died 1617) was a Scottish laird, knight, clan chief, and a shire commissioner. He was the son and heir of Walter MacAulay Ardincaple, who was the laird of Ardincaple and chief of Clan MacAulay. The MacAulay estate of Ardincaple was situated in the location of the modern village of Rhu and Helensburgh, which both lie on the eastern shore of the Gare Loch, in Argyll and Bute. As chief of his clan, he entered into a contract with the chief of the MacGregors, pledging service and assistance to their chief. His clan feuded with the Buchanans, and his marriage to the widow of a deceased Galbraith chief brought forth feuding with that clan. He also feuded with the Campbells, particularly the Captain of Carrick. The Campbells made several attempts on his life and he was wounded one such encounter. Towards the end of his life he was knighted for his services. On his death he was succeeded by his first cousin.
Personal
Aulay MacAulay was born in the 16th century; the son and heir of Walter MacAulay, laird of Ardincaple, and chief of Clan MacAulay. According to the 19th-century historian Joseph Irving, Walter and his elder half-brother, Alexander, were likely the first of the clan to take the surname MacAulay. Aulay MacAulay's mother—the wife of Walter MacAulay of Ardincaple—was Margaret Drummond, the eldest daughter of Alexander Drummond of Carnock. Aulay MacAulay of Ardincaple was married twice. His first wife was Joanna Cunningham, daughter of Cuthbert Cunningham of Corsehill. He later married Margaret Crawford, sometime before 24 April 1592, who was from the family of the Crawfords of Kilbirnie. Margaret Crawford was also the widow (and cousin) of James Galbraith of Culcreuch, 16th chief of Clan Galbraith. Ardincaple's marriage caused tension between him and his new son-in-law—Robert Galbraith of Culcreuch, 17th chief of Clan Galbraith.
Chief of Clan MacAulay
After the death of his father, Ardincaple became chief of Clan MacAulay. The clan was centred at Ardincaple Castle—which according to Irving, was erected by Aulay's father. The Ardincaple estate was located in what is today the village of Rhu, and town of Helensburgh, in Argyll and Bute. The area was within the Lennox district, which was then controlled by the dukes of Lennox. In the Roll of Landlords and Baillies of 1587, Ardincaple was listed as one of the principal vassals of the Duke of Lennox.
Bond of manrent with the chief of Clan Gregor
In the 15th and 16th centuries, the 'native' clans of the Lennox—the MacAulays, MacFarlanes, and Colquhouns—raided and plundered each other's lands and combined to sweep the lowlands of its flocks and herds. However, around this time period other clans entered the district—among them were the MacGregors, Campbells, Camerons and Buchanans.
On 27 May 1591, Ardincaple and Alexander MacGregor of Glenstrae, chief of Clan Gregor, signed a bond of manrent. In the bond, Ardincaple acknowledged Glenstrae as his chief and of being a cadet of the House of MacGregor, and therefore promised to pay the MacGregor chief his calp. The giving of calp—a tribute of cattle or the best eighth of a part of goods to a superior lord or chief—was a significant custom in Gaelic society. According to historian Ronald Williams, the contract between Ardincaple and Glenstrae gave the MacGregors some temporary relief from the Buchanans and Galbraiths. Also, at around this period in time, the MacAulays were feuding with the Buchanans. According to Irving, prior to this contract, Ardincaple did not appear to have been involved with Clan Gregor in any way. Irving went on to state that even though the Ardincaple was at feud with the Buchanans, it is unclear how such an alliance would benefit his own clan. Irving wrote that Ardincaple must have known that any connection with Clan Gregor "would end (as it actually did) in a manner most disastrous to all connected with the turbulent Macgregors".
Feuding with Galbraith of Culcreuch
In 1593, Robert Galbraith of Culcreuch was given a Commission of Justiciary to pursue the outlawed Clan Gregor. The MacAulays and Colquhouns were, however, suspicious of Culcreuch's real intentions. On 3 May 1593, the chiefs of the two clans complained to the Privy Council that Culcreuch had only purchased the commission under counsel from George Buchanan, and that Culcreuch had no intention of harassing the MacGregors. The MacAulays and Colquhouns feared that it was much more likely that the Galbraiths, allied with the Buchanans, would direct their vengeance against themselves under the guise of hunting and clearing Clan Gregor from the Lennox. Due to the influence of the Ardincaple's superior, Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox, the letters of Fire and Sword were taken from the Galbraiths and Buchanans. According to Williams, Ardincaple had been sparing of the entire truth, for no mention was made of the bond of manrent between himself and the now outlawed Clan Gregor chief. Williams was of the opinion that it was unlikely that the Privy Council was aware of such an agreement between the two chiefs. Even so, the Privy Council demanded securities of Ardincaple to insure that he not assist Clan Gregor.
Feuding with the Campbells
Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll pursued a violent feud with Ardincaple during the late 16th and early 17th century. Argyll's lieutenants in the area were Duncan Campbell, Captain of Carrick and Neil Campbell of Lochgoilhead, who led raids into Ardincaple's lands attempting to slay the MacAulay chief. The Campbells of Carrick were seated at Carrick Castle on the shores of Loch Goil (about northwest of Ardincaple). In 1598, Carrick registered a bond of 300 merks for each of his men in Rosneath to keep from harming Ardincaple. At the same time, Robert Sempill of Foulwood registered a bond of 2,000 merks for Carrick not to harm Ardincaple and his followers. The following year, the Duke of Lennox legally evicted Donald Campbell of Drongie and several of his followers from the lands of Mamoir, Mambeg, and Forlancarry along the banks of the Gare Loch. The Campbells of Drongie were close supporters of the Campbells of Carrick, and in retaliation a combined force of Campbells of Carrick and Drongie assembled at Rosneath (on opposite shore of the Gare Loch from Ardincaple Castle) and laid waste to the duke's new acquisitions. When the case was presented to the Privy Council on 17 May 1600, both Campbell of Carrick and Campbell of Drongie were denounced as rebels.
On 25 November 1600, evidence was brought forth to the Privy Council of an attempt on Ardincaple's life on 24 September 1600. The evidence pointed to Carrick's men coming at night to Ardincaple and attacking followers of the laird and killing one—Malcolm Galbraith. A second attempt on Ardincaple's life was carried out at night as he was staying at Nether Greenock. On this occasion, Ardincaple, Patrick Dennestoun (one of Ardincaple's servants), and Archibald Connel were all shot in the encounter. Again the Privy Council denounced Carrick and his men as rebels. At the end of November 1600, Carrick and 100 followers invaded the lands of Ardincaple armed with "hagbuts, pistolets, bows, darlochs and habershons". The force hid in the woods of Ardincaple for one night, taking several prisoners before fleeing. In the morning, a rider making towards the house of Ardincaple was presumed to be Ardincaple himself and nearly killed, before he was identified as a Campbell (servitor to the Earl of Argyll). Carrick's force, for fear of being pursued by men of the district, left the area after destroying houses, hamstringing animals, and making off with livestock belonging to other tenants of the duke. In the process the Carrick men "spuilyeit the houssis of John Dow McAula in Garelocheid and Patrik McCaula in Aldonit". For their actions, the participating Campbells were again denounced as rebels.
Suspicions of aiding Clan Gregor
Following the Battle of Glen Fruin, between Clan Gregor and Clan Colquhoun in February 1603, there was much public outcry against the rebellious MacGregors. By an Act of the Privy Council, on 3 April 1603, it was made an offence to bear the name MacGregor, or to give add and shelter to one. The Earl of Argyll, who was responsible to the Privy Council for the actions of the MacGregors, was entrusted to bring the force of the law against this lawless clan. Being deeply suspicious of Ardincaple's dealings with Glenstrae, one of Argyll's first moves was to bring acts against Ardincaple.
On 17 March 1603, John Stewart of Ardmaleish, Sheriff of Bute, became surety for Ardincaple; that he would appear in Edinburgh, on 17 May 1603, and answer to the charges of aiding, supplying, and inter-communing with Alasdair MacGregor of Glenstrae and other MacGregors. Ardincaple was also to answer for not "rising ye fray" and pursuing the outlawed clan in the Lennox. Ardincaple was accused of bringing the MacGregor "thevis and rebells" to the Colquhoun lands of Luss and for their part in stealing from the Colquhouns of Luss. Again the influence of the Duke of Lennox saved Ardincaple and his clan from the same fate as Glenstrae and his. On 7 April 1603, James VI wrote from Berwick to the Justice General and his deputies, declaring Ardincaple to be innocent of the alleged crimes and that he was to accompany the king to England with the Duke of Lennox. By the time the king's letter was received, Ardincaple had already left the Lennox district as part of the Duke of Lennox's train, which accompanied James VI on his way to England to be declared King James I of England.
The outlawed Glenstrae was finally apprehended by Argyll on 18 January 1604 after almost a year in hiding. and brought to Edinburgh to stand trial. The illiterate Glenstrae consented to give a preliminary statement which was titled a 'confession' and which convicted him out of his own mouth. Within his 'confession', Glenstrae accused Argyll of trying to persuade him to kill Ardincaple: "I Confess, before God, that he did all his craftie diligence to intyse me to slay and destroy the Laird Ardinkaippill, Mckallay, for ony ganes kyndness or freindschip that he mycht do or gif me. The quhilk I did refuis, in respect of my faithfull promeis maid to Mckallay of befor". Glenstrae and several of his leading men were then executed.
Despite Ardincaple's pledge of allegiance to Glenstrae in 1591, Irving noted that once Clan Gregor was outlawed Ardincaple turned against the clan, making "himself conspicuous by the energy with which he turned against them". The 19th-century historian William Anderson stated that Ardincaple probably intended to avert suspicions upon himself, for his prior dealings with the clan.
Later life
In 1597, Ardincaple was suretor to Lachlan Maclean of Coll who had to give up Breachacha Castle when required by the king. He was knighted before 1610. In 1608 he served as Commissioner for Dumbartonshire (as a minor baron). He was one of two commissioners who were tasked with regulating the price of boots and shoes. When in 1614, Angus Og MacDonald of Dunyvaig had seized Dunyvaig Castle—which had been held by the Bishop of the Isles—Sir Aulay MacAulay of Ardincaple, with twenty of his men, accompanied the bishop to Islay to demand the surrender of the castle. Sir Aulay MacAulay of Ardincaple died in December 1617. He left no issue by either of his two wives. He was succeeded by his first cousin, Alexander MacAulay of Durling (son of Aulay MacAulay of Durling, Sir Aulay's uncle).
Personal heraldry
No coat of arms of a MacAulay chief has ever been matriculated by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, the head of the heraldic authority in Scotland. Aulay Macaulay of Ardincaple's seal, in 1593, is blazoned: a fess chequy and in chief a buckle. These elements are also used in the heraldry of 'MacAulays' to this day. According to the 19th century heraldist Robert Riddle Stodart, these elements are ultimately derived from the heraldry of the Stewarts.

Rémy Roy (born 1958), known as The Minitel Killer (), is a French serial killer who killed three gay men from 1990 to 1991 out of a self-admitted hatred towards homosexuals. He earned his nickname due to the fact that he messaged prospective victims through the "pink Minitel" (, a term referring to the use of the Minitel, a telephone-based French Videotex, for erotic purposes) and offering to engage in BDSM in order to lure them.
Biography
Rémy Roy was born in an indeterminate region of France in 1958. He grew up pampered by his parents and studied at a religious school, the Brothers of Saint-Vincent de Paul, but was considered a mediocre student. After graduating, he went to a sailing school and eventually became a skipper, with his profession allowing him to meet people such as Florence Arthaud, Philippe Poupon and Olivier de Kersauson, and even worked with a close companion of Nicolas Hulot. During this time, he also met his future wife, Françoise, the owner of a local bookstore, whom he later married and moved in with at a house in Villejuif, where they soon had two children together.
According to Roy's wife, he was a kind, generous father who always looked after his family and even actively helped her run the bookstore, refusing to accept a salary for his efforts. This changed in 1988, when his wife hired a friend to help out, which left Roy with nothing to do. Now left with much free time, he decided to open a promotional video company based in his home, but this failed to generate any interest. Due to the failure of his business, Roy became depressed and started spending most of his time in bed eating, eventually growing to 120 kilograms in size. Around this time, he started to frequently use Minitel, spending more and more time on it, up to several hours a day.
Murders and investigation
On the afternoon of October 11, 1990, Roy made an appointment with 46-year-old insurance agent Paul Bernard to meet up at a marina in Draveil, near the edge of the Seine. Bernard lived in Issy-les-Moulineaux with his widowed, retired mother and frequently used his Minitel to look for hook-ups to satiate his masochistic tendencies. After allowing Roy to gag him with a scarf, tie his hands behind his back and his testicles with a string, he was left to suffocate before Roy crushed his head with a large stone. Bernard's naked body was found on the following morning by a fisherman, with a pair of pants covering his head. His car was found in a parking lot about a kilometer away from the marina. An autopsy determined that he had been asphyxiated or strangled, as there were traces of a tie around his neck.
During the night of October 19 to 20, Roy went to the house of 48-year-old Gilbert Duquesnoy, an astrologer who lived in Champigny-sur-Marne and practiced under the name "Nathaniel the Magician". Like the previous victim, he used the Minitel to look to cruise for people who would indulge into his masochistic tendencies. The pair eventually went to Duquesnoy's office in Paris's 9th arrondissement, where they drank a few glasses of port wine before Roy covered his sex partner's head with a leather hood and tied his ankles and hands behind his back. Now left with nothing to defend himself, Roy proceeded to hit Duquesnoy at least seven times on the head with a hammer, which he then stole along with the glass of wine, his victim's diary and address books, and promptly leaving the apartment. For some time, Duquesnoy's dachshund followed him, but eventually returned to the apartment. Roy eventually threw the hammer into the Marne and later disposed of the remaining items at the Nogent-sur-Marne station. Approximately two days later, Alain, Duquesnoy's partner, asked some neighbors to go and check on him since he was not answering his phone calls. After entering the apartment, they found the man lying naked on his bed, an open briefcase with sex toys next to him, and the house ransacked.
On November 17, at about 11 AM, Roy went to the home of 41-year-old Hugues Moreau, the manager of a walling company based in Paris. Soon after, Roy smashed Moreau's skull using a large metal tap before stealing his checkbooks, bank cards and a fax machine. Moreau's wife discovered his body about two hours later, with the man being naked, his limbs bound and a chain tied around his waist. A bag full of BDSM-related items was found next to the bed. While an investigation was going on concerning this murder, Roy bought an underwater camcorder using the money he had stolen from Moreau's apartment.
Attempted murder and identification
On October 8, 1991, Roy went to the house of 32-year-old Bruno Giraudon, a civil servant living in Villeneuve-Saint-Georges who was looking for a companion and possible lover on Minitel. After drinking and talking for some time, Roy told Giraudon that he was a photographer specializing in the sailing world, and claimed that he was adept at sadomasochistic practices. He then took out his bag and showed some of his equipment as an offer to try it out, but surprisingly, Giraudon refused. Upon hearing this, Roy hit him on the head with a lamp stand, causing him to faint. Deciding to leave him for dead, Roy stole his checkbook and identity papers, leaving the accessories behind. Giraudon's friends later found him naked and covered in blood, in an apparent comatose state, and quickly drove him to the nearest hospital. He eventually recovered three days later, and gave a description of his assailant to authorities.
The following month, Roy went to a video store and bought a flatbed editor and a VCR, saying to the clerk that he had a camcorder for underwater filming and wanted an editor that was compatible with it. The price amounted to 14,000 francs, requiring that he provide an ID, for which Roy paid with Giraudon's money and used his identity to present himself. A few hours later, he makes another purchase in another video store using the exact same method, but this time, he was recorded on the store's surveillance cameras. Eventually, investigators managed to obtain the surveillance footage and supplied still images to several editors of newspapers specialised in sailing. This idea led to the editor-in-chief of Neptune Yachting, Alain Coroller, to identify the man on the footage as Rémy Roy.
Arrest, trial and imprisonment
On November 28, 1991, Roy was arrested at his home in Villejuif, with investigators finding Giraudon's checkbook and driver's license in his parka. While incarcerated in Fresnes Prison, he confessed responsibility for the crimes and explained in great detail what had transpired, but denied being gay and claimed that they had killed each victim because he was a homophobe. When interviewed by psychiatrist Jean Martel and psychologist Caroline Legendre, Roy made several revelations about his life that attracted interest: he claimed that he suffered a lot from the absences of his father, who travelled a lot, and was frequently whipped with a leather strap by his mother. As for his homophobia, Roy claimed several incidents led him to develop a seething hatred towards gay men:
when he was young, he was tied by the arm to a tree branch by some classmates, who then stripped him naked
at age 13, he went watch a movie in a theatre, but the man sitting next to him accidentally ejaculated on him while masturbating.
at age 17, while working as an apprentice repairman at an electronics shop, he was asked by a group of friends to repay them their money, as they thought that he charged too much for his services. When he was unable to pay, they instead told him to expose himself to an elderly man in a gym, which Roy refused to do and instead ran away. Angered by his refusal, the men then tracked him down and collectively gang raped him.
The authorities investigated each and every single one of these claims, finding that none of them had actually happened and that these were simply sadomasochistic fantasies that Roy falsely presented as memories. He was soon charged with the two counts of murder (Bernard and Duquesnoy), one count of manslaughter (Moreau) and the attempted murder of Giraudon. On June 26, 1996, Roy's trial began at the cour d'assises in Créteil. After two days of deliberations, he was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to a life term with 18 years of preventative detention.

The Chroococcales () are an order of cyanobacteria in some classifications which includes the harmful algal bloom Microcystis aeruginosa. Molecular data indicate that Chroococcales may be polyphyletic, meaning its members may not all belong to the same clade or have the same common ancestor.
Characteristics
The order is characterized by single, floating cells or colonies which are embedded to a matrix. Also, a lack of differentiation between apical and basal structures exists.

Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase 5 (MAP3K5) is a member of MAP kinase family and as such a part of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. It activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases in a Raf-independent fashion in response to an array of stresses such as oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and calcium influx. ASK1 has been found to be involved in cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.
MAP3K5 gene coding for the protein is located on chromosome 6 at locus 6q22.33. and the transcribed protein contains 1,374 amino acids with 11 kinase subdomains. Northern blot analysis shows that MAP3K5 transcript is abundant in human heart and pancreas.
Mechanism of activation
Under nonstress conditions ASK1 is oligomerized (a requirement for its activation) through its C-terminal coiled-coil domain (CCC), but remains in an inactive form by the suppressive effect of reduced thioredoxin (Trx) and calcium and integrin binding protein 1 (CIB1). Trx inhibits ASK1 kinase activity by direct binding to its N-terminal coiled-coil domain (NCC). Trx and CIB1 regulate ASK1 activation in a redox- or calcium- sensitive manner, respectively. Both appear to compete with TNF-α receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), an ASK1 activator. TRAF2 and TRAF6 are then recruited to ASK1 to form a larger molecular mass complex. Subsequently, ASK1 forms homo-oligomeric interactions not only through the CCC, but also the NCC, which leads to full activation of ASK1 through autophosphorylation at threonine 845.
ASK1 gene transcription can be induced by inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-α through the activation of the NF-kb protein RelA. Interestingly, TNF-α is also able to stabilize the ASK1 protein through deubiquitination. Thus, unlike other members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, the regulation of ASK1 expression is transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional.
Interactions
ASK1 has been shown to interact with:
C-Raf,
CDC25A,
DAXX,
DUSP19,
EIF2AK2,
GADD45B,
HSPA1A,
MAP2K6,
MAP3K7 and
MAPK8IP3,
PDCD6,
PPP5C,
RB1CC1,
TRAF2,
TRAF5, and
TRAF6.
Research
A paper published on 28 June 2022 demonstrated that MAP3K5 may be one of the potential targets of ALS. It is found that MAP3K5 is upregulated in both CNS fALS and sALS using an AI-enabled biological target discovery platform. With target discovery, several pathways and drugs and be further designed to treat ALS.

David Klein (1908 – 1993) was a Swiss human geneticist and ophthalmologist.
Klein graduating from the University of Basel in 1934. After graduating, he worked at the Rheinau Psychiatric Clinic, Zurich. He moved to Geneva as scientific assistant to professor Adolphe Franceschetti at the ophthalmological clinic. In 1970 he was appointed full professor. He retired in 1978 with the status of professor emeritus. After retirement, he was active as consultant in human genetics at the ophthalmological clinic, Geneva, and the school of amblyopic and blind children in Baar, Switzerland.
Klein made important contributions towards the understanding of Waardenburg syndrome, or more fully, the "van der Hoeve-Halbertsma-Waardenburg-Klein syndrome". In August 1947 Klein presented a deaf mute child, who was 10 years of age, and had partial albinism of the hair and body, blue hypoplastic irides, blepharophimosis and malformation of arms, to the Swiss Society of Genetics, and gave a full report of his findings in 1950.

Plasminogen, sold under the brand name Ryplazim, is a biologic medication for the treatment of hypoplasminogenemia (plasminogen deficiency type 1). It is purified from human plasma and is administered intravenously.
The most common side effects include abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, bleeding, limb pain, fatigue, constipation, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, joint pain, and back pain.
Individuals with hypoplasminogenemia lack a protein called plasminogen, which is responsible for the ability of the body to break down fibrin clots. Plasminogen deficiency leads to an accumulation of fibrin, causing the development of growths (lesions) that can impair normal tissue and organ function and may lead to blindness when these lesions affect the eyes.
Plasminogen, human-tvmh was approved for medical use in the United States in June 2021. It is the first therapy for hypoplasminogenemia approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Medical uses
Plasminogen, human-tvmh is indicated for the treatment of people with plasminogen deficiency type 1, also referred to as hypoplasminogenemia, a disorder that can impair normal tissue and organ function and may lead to blindness.
History
The effectiveness and safety of plasminogen is primarily based on one single-arm, open-label (unblinded) clinical trial enrolling 15 adult and pediatric participants with plasminogen deficiency type 1. All participants received plasminogen administered every two to four days for 48 weeks. The effectiveness of plasminogen was demonstrated by at least 50% improvement of their lesions in all 11 participants who had lesions at baseline, and absence of recurrent or new lesions in any of the 15 participants through the 48 weeks of treatment.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for plasminogen orphan drug designation, fast track designation, priority review, and a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher. The FDA granted approval of Ryplazim to ProMetic Biotherapeutics Inc.

In Hawaiian religion, the Kumulipo is the creation chant, first recorded by Westerners in the 18th century. It also includes a genealogy of the members of Hawaiian royalty and was created in honor of Kalaninuiamamao and passed down orally to his daughter Alapaiwahine.
Creation chant
In the Kumulipo the world was created over a cosmic night. This is not just one night, but many nights over time. The ancient Hawaiian kahuna and priests of the Hawaiian religion would recite the Kumulipo during the makahiki season, honoring the god Lono. In 1779, Captain James Cook arrived in Kealakekua Bay on the island of Hawaii during the season and was greeted by the Hawaiians reciting the Kumulipo. Some stories say Cook was mistaken for Lono, because of the type of sails on his ship and his pale skintone.
In 1889, King Kalākaua printed a sixty-page pamphlet of the Kumulipo. Attached to the pamphlet was a 2-page paper on how the chant was originally composed and recited.
Years later Queen Liliuokalani described the chant as a prayer of the development of the universe and the ancestry of the Hawaiians. Liliuokalani translated the chant under house arrest in Iolani Palace. The translation was published in 1897, then republished by Pueo Press in 1978.
The Kumulipo is a total of 2,102 lines long, in honor of Kalaninuiamamao, who created peace for all when he was born. There was a lot of fighting between his ʻI and Keawe family, who were cousins so his birth stopped the two from feuding. The Kumulipo is a cosmogonic genealogy, which means that it relates to the stars and the moon. Out of the 2102 lines, it has 16 "wā" which means era or age. In each wā, something is born whether it is a human, plant, or creature.
Divisions
The Kumulipo is divided into sixteen wā, sections. The first seven wā fall under the section of pō (darkness), the age of spirit. The Earth may or may not exist, but the events described do not take place in a physical universe. The words show the development of life as it goes through similar stages as a human child. All plants and animals of sea and land, earth and sky, male and female are created. Eventually, it leads to early mammals.
These are the first twelve lines of the Kumulipo, in Hawaiian, in Liliuokalani's English translation and in Bastian's German translation. Two other significant English translations - Rock's translation of Bastian and Beckwith's translation - appear in Beckwith's 1951 book The Kumulipo.

At the time when the light of the sun was subdued

The second section, containing the remaining nine wā, is ao and is signaled by the arrival of light and the gods, who watch over the changing of animals into the first humans. After that is the complex genealogy of Kalaninuiamamao that goes all the way to the late 18th century.
Births in each wā
The births in each age include:
In the first wā, the sea urchins and limu (seaweed) were born. The limu was connected through its name to the land ferns. Some of these limu and fern pairs include: ʻEkaha and ʻEkahakaha, Limu ʻAʻalaʻula and ʻalaʻalawainui mint, Limu Manauea and Kalo Maunauea upland taro, Limu Kala and ʻAkala strawberry. These plants were born to protect their sea cousins.
In the second wā, 73 types of fish. Some deep sea fish include Naiʻa (porpoise) and the Mano (shark). Also reef fish, including Moi and Weke. Certain plants that have similar names are related to these fish and are born as protectors of the fish.
In the third wā, 52 types of flying creatures, which include birds of the sea such as ʻIwa (frigate or man-of-war bird), the Lupe, and the Noio (Hawaiian noddy tern). These seabirds have land relatives, such as Io (hawk), Nene (goose), and Pueo (owl). In this wā, insects were also born, such as Peʻelua (caterpillar) and the Pulelehua (butterfly).
In the fourth wā, the creepy and crawly creatures are born. These include Honu (sea turtle), Ula (lobster), Moʻo (lizards), and Pololia (jellyfish). Their cousins on land include Kuhonua (maile vine) and ʻOheʻohe bamboo.
In the fifth wā, Kalo (taro) is born.
In the sixth wā, Uku (flea) and the ʻIole (rat) are born.
In the seventh wā, ʻĪlio (dog) and the Peʻapeʻa (bat) are born.
In the eighth wā, the four divinities are born: Laʻilaʻi (Female), Kiʻi (Male), Kāne (God), Kanaloa (Octopus), respectively.
In the ninth wā, Laʻilaʻi takes her eldest brother Kiʻi as a mate and the first humans are born from her brain.
In the tenth wā, Laʻilaʻi takes her next brother Kāne as a mate after losing interest in Kiʻi, she then had four of Kāne's children: Laʻiʻoloʻolo, Kamahaʻina (Male), Kamamule (Male), Kamakalua (Female). Laʻilaʻi soon returned to Kiʻi and three children are born: Haʻi(F), Haliʻa(F), and Hākea(M). Having been born during their mothers being with two men they become "Poʻolua" and claim the lineage of both fathers.
The eleventh wā pays homage to the Moa.
The twelfth wā is very important to Hawaiians because it honors the lineage of Wākea, whose son Hāloa is the ancestor of all people.
The thirteenth wā is also very important to Hawaiians because it honors the lineage of Hāloa's mother Papahānaumoku.
In the fourteenth wā Liʻaikūhonua mates with Keakahulihonua, and have their child Laka.
The fifteenth wā refers to Haumeanuiʻāiwaiwa and her lineage, it also explains Māui's adventures and siblings.
The sixteenth wā recounts all of Māui's lineage for forty-four generations, all the way down to the Moʻi of Māui, Piʻilani.
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, anthropologists Adolf Bastian and Roland Burrage Dixon interpreted a recurring verse of the Kumulipo as describing the octopus as the sole survivor of a previous age of existence. In her 1951 translation of the Kumulipo, ethnographer Martha Warren Beckwith provided a different translation of the verse, although she does discuss the possibility that "octopus" is the correct translation and describes the god Kanaloa.
Comparative literature
Comparisons may be made between marital partners (husband and wife often have synonymous names), between genealogical and flora-fauna names, and in other Polynesian genealogies.<ref>See Kumulipo spouse-names, terms for flora and fauna in the Kumulipo, and [http://00.gs/Maniapoto;Uriwera;Moriori;Hivaoa;Kumulipo.htm Maori and Rarotongan parallels with the Kumulipo]</ref>
Cultural impact
The supermassive black hole M87*, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope, was informally given the Hawaiian name "Pōwehi", a poetic description of generative darkness or the spirit world taken from the Kumulipo.
In 2009, the poet Jamaica Heolimeleikalani Osorio performed her poem, Kumulipo, at a poetry event at the White House.

Willandra Homestead is a heritage-listed homestead in the Willandra National Park, Carrathool Shire, New South Wales, Australia. It was designed by Laird & Buchan and built in 1918 by Frederick Coulson. The property is owned by the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.
History
Willandra Homestead was the residence of the former Willandra Station. Willandra Station had been settled in the 1880s by the partnership of Whittingham and Haynes, and had once consisted of 736,000 acres.
Willandra Station was the location of conflict during the 1890s shearing strikes, with Willandra shearers reportedly arming themselves to support the new shearers' union in 1890. Shearing at the station is referenced in the colonial folk song "Flash Jack from Gundagai".
It was subsequently owned by the London Bank of Australia before being sold to pastoral families the Fields and Vickerys in 1912. Under their management, it became one of the largest stud merino stations in Australia, running more than 90,000 sheep.
The current homestead was built in 1918. It uses some of the earliest asbestos fibrous cement sheeting manufactured in Australia.
The original shearing shed, which had 83 stands, burned down in the twentieth century and was replaced by a much smaller 12 stands shed.
The property was sold to the New Zealand Land Company in the 1950s and again to Dalgety & Company in 1960.
The Willandra National Park was created in May 1972 covering 13,000 acres of land, but did not initially include the homestead area. In 1974, the lease on the leasehold portion of the former station expired and was not renewed, and Dalgety decided to sell the freehold portion. Boral, whose managing director had been associated with the station, bought a 6,000 acre sections including the homestead and shearing precincts for $100,000, donated it to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, and donated $30,000 towards the cost of establishing the park.
Following the handover to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the fate of the homestead was initially unclear, and in 1977 it was described as "unoccupied and in bad repair" with no decision made about its future. It underwent stabilisation works in the 1970s and 1980s, before the homestead and shearing precincts were fully restored between 1996 and 2001. The homestead complex now serves as tourist accommodation, available in the homestead itself, cottage and men's quarters.
Description
The homestead buildings survive in what is now the Willandra National Park.
The 26-room weatherboard main homestead, dating from 1918, is laid out in a U-shape around a central courtyard, surrounded by verandahs. The homestead complex also includes a number of surviving outbuildings, including jackaroos quarters (1918), ram shed (1933) and cottages (1940s).
The shearing precinct includes the shearers' quarters, cook house and overseers' cottage, all dating from 1936, and the rebuilt shearing shed, dating from 1960.
The main house is now used as upmarket accommodation, with less expensive accommodation also available on site.
The overseers' cottage, sections of the jackaroo's quarters, workshop, stables and garage are used for staff and management purposes.
Heritage listing
The homestead is of state significance as a rare, intact and confident example of domestic rural architecture influenced by international trends in modern architectural design and aesthetics. The residence was designed by Laird and Buchan a well known and successful Victorian architectural firm. It is a modernist interpretation of a rural homestead form completely built with the most modern materials and restrained use of architectural decorations in vogue at the time. The building demonstrates the aspirations of the Willandra Pastoral Co., and their optimism for the future of the property buoyed by the end of World War One. The homestead is the centre piece of the homestead precinct situated in a formally landscaped context, complete with associational outbuildings, utilitarian and pleasure gardens and recreational facilities.
Willandra Homestead was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

National Cycle Route 75 runs from Edinburgh to Gourock via Glasgow. It is often known as the Clyde to Forth cycle route.
It then extends via the ferry from Gourock to Dunoon onto the Cowal peninsula to Portavadie from where another ferry connects on to the Kintyre peninsula
Route
Route 75 Map
Edinburgh to Bathgate
The route begins in Leith, Edinburgh at the north-eastern terminus of the Water of Leith until Warriston, then runs southward in Edinburgh City Centre before joining with the eastern terminus of the Union Canal at Fountainbridge. Just after the viaduct at Slateford, the route returns to the Water of Leith until its south-western terminus at Balerno. Thereafter it passes through Kirknewton, East Calder, Almondell and Calderwood Country Park, Mid Calder, Livingston and Bathgate.
Edinburgh | Kirknewton | Livingston | Bathgate
Bathgate to Glasgow
Between Bathgate and Airdrie the route follows alongside the newly reopened Airdrie-Bathgate railway line, passing Armadale, Blackridge and Caldercruix. Where the cycle route merges onto the A89 (Main street) [Plains] then through a short section of residential streets in Airdrie, (Craigneuk, Gartlea and Cairnhill) before proceeding into Coatdyke, the route joins a disused railway line between Airdrie and Coatbridge. The section into Coatbridge town centre is on the alignment of the former Monkland Canal. Beyond Coatbridge the route passes through Tannochside, Uddingston, Newton and Westburn to reach Cambuslang. From Cambuslang to Glasgow the route follows the Clyde walkway.
Bathgate | Airdrie | Coatbridge | Uddingston | Cambuslang | Glasgow
Glasgow to Gourock
The route runs along the north of the Clyde to the SECC, where it joins NCR 7 through Paisley to Johnstone. It then branches west, following a disused railway track through Bridge of Weir and Kilmacolm to Port Glasgow. After a short residential section, it rejoins the disused railway in an industrial estate, which it follows to Greenock. It then leads to the sea front, and along to Gourock.
A section of the route between Airdrie and Bathgate closed in October 2008 as part of a £300 million project to reopen the railway. Network Rail will build a replacement cycle path, due for completion in December 2010, although not now expected to open until May 2011.
Glasgow | Paisley | Kilmacolm | Greenock | Gourock
Dunoon to Portavadie
After catching the ferry from Gourock to cross the Clyde to Dunoon, the route continues on the Cowal peninsula past Loch Striven and Tighnabruaich to Portavadie from where another ferry connects on to the Kintyre peninsula

The Columbian Viceroyalty, Viceroyalty of India or First Viceroyalty in the Indies is the name that designates the number of titles and rights granted to Christopher Columbus by the Catholic Monarchs in 1492 on the lands discovered and undiscovered, before embarking on his first trip that culminated in the rediscovery of the Americas.
Origins
The titles and powers over discovered lands granted to Christopher Columbus were entered in the capitulations of Santa Fe agreed on April 17 of 1492.
Under them, the Catholic Monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand, awarded for the period of his life, and after his death, to be conferred on his heirs or Successors one after the other perpetually:
The title of Admiral of the Ocean Sea over all the islands and the mainland that discovered or won in this sea.
The titles, always referred to together, of "Viceroy and Governor General".
In addition, other powers and economic prerogatives.
These titles would be confirmed by the monarchs on his return from his first voyage in May 1493. Of these, the best known in Castile, which paid the most attention both Columbus and the monarchs, was the Admiral.
History
According to the capitulations of Santa Fe, all lands discovered by Christopher Columbus were part of his viceroyalty:
In his first trip to the Americas (it got to Guanahani on 12 October 1492), Columbus discovered the Bahamas, Cuba and The Hispaniola, exerting his position as viceroy and governor in them, leaving to return to Spain to 39 men in La Navidad in Hispaniola, which was founded on December 25, 1492. the fort was destroyed shortly then by the Indians of the island, killing all its occupants.
On his second trip in 1493 Christopher Columbus discovered Guadalupe and other islands located on the side of the Atlantic Ocean between it and Puerto Rico, where he arrived on 19 November 1493. Later he found Jamaica and explored Cuba. On his return to Spain in 1496 he discovered the Lesser Antilles located on the side of the Caribbean Sea between Puerto Rico and Dominica.
On his third trip in 1498 he discovered Trinidad, Paria Peninsula and the Island of Margarita, remaining until 1500 in Hispaniola.
The kings sent to the Spanish as pesquisador judge (with government functions) to Francisco de Bobadilla in 1500, which upon arrival (August 23) arrested Columbus and his brothers and sailed Spain, dismissing him from the government. Columbus refused to be removed the shackles around his trip to Spain, during which he wrote a long letter to the Catholic Monarchs. Upon arriving to Spain he regained his freedom, but had lost prestige, its powers and the viceroyality.
Bobadilla was also relieved of his government and replaced by Nicolas de Ovando in 1502.
On his fourth trip, in 1502, he found St. Lucia and Martinique. He then toured the Central American coast from the Bay Islands to Gulf of Urabá. He remained in Jamaica until 1504 and then returned to Spain died on May 20, 1506 in Convent of San Francisco of Valladolid.
Since 1499 the kings authorized other trips of discovery without the authorization of Columbus, including those of Alonso de Ojeda and Vicente Yáñez Pinzón, creating for them governments in the territories they discovered: the governorate Coquibacoa on the coast of Venezuela, except Paria discovered by Columbus was for De Ojeda and Pinzón the governor off the coast of Brazil between the Amazon river and the Cape Holy Mary of Consolation. These governorates were exempted from the Viceroyalty of the Indies.
The Viceroyalty after the death of Columbus
On Christopher Columbus's death his eldest son Diego Columbus inherited his father's rights in the Americas, including the viceroyalty. However, King Ferdinand refused at first to transfer all rights of his father and appointed him governor of Hispaniola in 1508. Diego began a series of lawsuits against the crown known as the Columbian Lawsuits, and in 1511 his rights as viceroy were recognized, but with limited jurisdiction over those territories that had been officially discovered by his father. Consequently, Diego Columbus became the second Viceroy of the Indies. He died in 1526 bequeathing his rights to the viceroyalty to his son Luis Colón.
During the minority of Luis Colón the transaction occurred and arbitration that ended Columbian Lawsuits with the Spanish crown and in 1537 he received the knighthood of this I Duke of Veragua and Manor territorial six hundred twenty-five square leagues, composed of lands of ancient Veragua and Castilla del Oro. He was also graced with the hereditary dignity of I Marquis of Jamaica and the lordship of the island, putting an end to the Viceroyalty of the Indies

The Mutual Burlesque Association, also called the Mutual Wheel or the MBA, was an American burlesque circuit active from 1922 until 1931. Controlled by Isidore Herk, it quickly replaced its parent company and competitor, the Columbia Amusement Company, as the preeminent burlesque circuit during the Roaring Twenties. Comedians Bud Abbott, Lou Costello (not yet a team), Harry Steppe, Joe Penner, Billy Gilbert, Rags Ragland, and Billy Hagan, as well as stripteasers Ann Corio, Hinda Wausau, Gypsy Rose Lee, and Carrie Finnell, performed in Mutual shows. Mae West appeared in Mutual shows from 1922 to 1925. Mutual collapsed during the Great Depression.
Formation
David Krause (a theater owner), Dr. George E. Lothrop (a physician who operated Boston's Howard Athenaeum), and Al Singer (who mounted shows on the Columbia wheel) incorporated the MBA in 1922. Most of the franchisees and producers came from the American Wheel, a subsidiary of the Columbia circuit that played less prestigious venues and went bankrupt. Isidore Herk, who had been president of the American Wheel, left to establish a vaudeville circuit with the Shubert organization. When that failed, Herk returned to burlesque the following year, replaced Singer, and eventually became Mutual's president. Mutual producers included Hurtig and Seamon, Al Reeves, Ed Rush, Ed Daley, John G. Jermon and Billy (Beef Trust) Watson.
Many performers and producers abandoned Columbia, which was seen as behind the times, for the new wheel, which took inspiration from fast-paced and sometimes risque Broadway revues like Earl Carroll's Vanities and the Ziegfeld Follies. Yet it was a 1925 Columbia show, "Powder Puff Revue," that was the first burlesque show to follow the precedent set by Ziegfeld and Carroll and feature female nudity.
In Herk's obituary, Variety recounted, "With the initial season of the MBA, Herk learned that burlesque fans still wanted rough shows. So he obliged with plenty of bumps and strip-teasing, naughty blackouts and stag jokes. Although Herk had placed a limit on the 'dirt' stuff, producers and comics went beyond it when on the road. Everybody made plenty of coin." Billboard claimed that Mutual "polluted public morals", but Herk defended it as the "jazz of American entertainment," and asserted that his shows were "clean, working class entertainments".
Mutual thrived for most of the 1920s. At its peak, up to 50 self-contained Mutual shows rotated through as many affiliated theaters each season. (A season ran from Labor Day to the following April or May.) Ann Corio recalled in her 1968 book, This Was Burlesque, "Most people may imagine a burlesque company to consist of only a few strippers, a couple of comics and a straight man; but in the days of the Mutual Wheel, a burlesque company was as big—or bigger—than most touring Broadway musicals of today. This was a typical company of the day: a striptease star, a prima donna, a soubrette, a talking woman, a boy and girl dance team, two comics, a straight man, a singing juvenile, twelve or fourteen chorus girls, a musical conductor, three stage hands, and an assortment of cats, dogs, monkeys etc. (the actors' pets). In other words, a minimum of 26 people — plus all of the [wardrobe], scenery and props."
With Mutual as legitimate competition, a bitter rivalry developed between Herk and his former boss, Sam Scribner, and Mutual and Columbia. But early in 1928, the two circuits were each losing customers to racier local stock burlesque shows like those of the Minskys. Columbia and Mutual merged to form the United Burlesque Association, but the new circuit was still referred to as Mutual, with Herk in charge.
Affiliated Theaters
Mutual shows rotated through the following theaters during the 1927-28 season: Gayety, Montreal; Garden, Buffalo; Corinthian, Rochester; Howard, Boston; Plaza, Worcester; Lyric, Newark; Orpheum, Paterson; Hudson, Union City; Gayety, Brooklyn; Star, Brooklyn; State, Springfield; Hurtig and Seamon's 125th Street, New York; Gayety, Scranton; Trocadero, Philadelphia; Academy, Pittsburgh; Gayety, Wilkes-Barre; Gayety, Baltimore; Strand, Washington, D.C.; Empire, Cleveland; Empire, Toledo; Grand, Akron; Lyric, Dayton; Empress, Cincinnati; Mutual, Indianapolis; Gayety, Louisville; Garrick, St. Louis; Gayety, Kansas City; Gayety, Omaha; Garrick, Des Moines; Gayety, Milwaukee; Gayety, Minneapolis; Empress, Chicago; Cadillac, Detroit. Shows were not routed around the wheel in this order, and the list was subject to slight change each year.
Show Titles
Mutual's shows for the 1927-28 season included Band Box Revue, Banner Burlesquers, Bathing Beauties, Big Revue, Bowery Burlesquers, Carrie Finnell's Show, Follies of Pleasure, French Models, Frivolities of 1928, Ginger Girls, Girls from Happyland, Girls from the Follies, Girls of the U.S.A., Happy Hours, Hello Paree, High Flyers, High Life, Hollywood Scandals, Kandy Kids, Jazztime Revue, Laffin' Thru, Moonlight Maids, Naughty Nifties, Nite Hawks, Nite Life in Paris, Parisian Flappers, Pretty Babies, Record Breakers, Red Hot, Social Maids, Speed Girls, Step Lively Girls, Stolen Sweets, Sugar Babies, and Tempters. Some titles were used year after year, although with different casts and content. (Sugar Babies was used as the title of an unrelated burlesque musical produced on Broadway in 1979.)
Decline
After the 1929 stock market crash, Mutual began a precipitous decline as its working-class audience became and remained unemployed and the number of stock (local independent) burlesque theaters multiplied. Herk cut salaries, budgets and casts, but many shows did not complete their tours in 1930 and 1931. In the spring of 1931, Herk pared the circuit down to 10 shows in as many weeks and theaters. This strategy was not successful in keeping Mutual afloat, and on June 9, 1931, Variety declared, "Mutual Officially Dead." Herk joined forces with the Minskys and organized a new wheel of 25 shows and theaters called the New Columbia Burlesque Circuit, but it, too, eventually crumbled. Large, organized wheel burlesque was replaced by stock burlesque, some with smaller, localized circuits.

Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi () or Chingphuron Konthousu () is a goddess in Meitei mythology and religion (Sanamahism) of ancient Kangleipak (ancient Manipur), in land that is currently the state of Manipur in India.
She was formerly a mortal being belonging to the Haorok Konthou clan (Konthoujam clan). She is a consort of the sky god Salailen (alias Soraren). Her only child is Khoriphaba.
Mythology
Konthoujamba and Konthoujambi were a couple with no child. They consulted maibas, but the maibas could not help them have a child. They prayed to the sky god Salailen to help them. Salailen heard their prayer and told the goddess Imoinu to help the couple. Imoinu implanted herself into the womb of Lady Konthoujambi.
When Konthoujambi was pregnant with a three month old fetus, Salailen instructed her that her child will be His wife in the future. Later, Konthoujambi gave birth to a baby girl. The couple named their daughter Chingphulon Konthousu (later known as Tampha).
As Chingphulon Konthousu grew up, she was known for her beauty and gentleness. She used to go to woods, lakes, and open meadows for fun. One day, while Tampha was out in an open field with her friends, a strong wind blew. Tampha was lifted up by a whirlwind towards the sky. Her friends could do nothing but watch. The wind took her to heaven, the abode of Salailen. He was waiting for her.
Tampha was unhappy about being far away from her parents and friends. To please her, Salailen promised her that the people of her native place would attain immortality and be safe from all diseases. Still, her parents, family and friends cried for the loss of her. Salailen told them that Tampha was safe with him. He told them about the promises he kept to her. Many years had passed and Salailen and Tampha had a son. She and Salailen named their son Khoriphaba.
Tampha's parents wanted to see her, so they planned to meet her. Men went on a hunting expedition with their hunting dogs across the Thangjing Hills. Unfortunately, they could not catch even one animal. The tired hunters rested under the shade of a tree. Meanwhile, one of their favorite hunting dogs wandered away. The dog saw a large python sitting in sun. It barked at the python. The python killed it. Later, the hunters found the dead dog and carried it home. They prepared a funeral for the dog. The smoke from the funeral rose up towards the sky.
Up in heaven, Tampha saw the smoke rising from her native place. She knew it was for a funeral. She worried about her people. Perhaps someone had died even though Salailen had promised to keep them safe from disease. She asked Salailen about his promises. Salailen told her that the funeral was only for a dog. She did not believe him and wanted to see her parents. Reluctantly, Salailen allowed her to meet people under some conditions. She should leave only after their son Khoriphaba had gone to sleep and should come back before he woke up. Also, she should not consume any earthly foods or drinks. Then, he placed a golden ladder (or golden stairs in another version) for her to climb down. She landed on the Thangjing Hill and then went to Konthoujam, her native land. She met her near and dear ones. Her mother offered Tampha delicious foods.
Tampha did not accept her mother's offers. However, her mother caught hold of her and tried to force her to eat. Tampha told her mother of the conditions with which she was leaving heaven to meet them on earth. Then, her mother arranged a shade with seven layers of false ceiling, enclosed by seven layers of drapery. Her plan was to block the vision of Salailen from above. Inside the shades, she served out delicious food for Tampha. Poor Tampha was compelled to eat what her mother had so lovingly prepared for her. But Salailen saw it happen even through the drapes. As Tampha started eating, Salailen proclaimed from heaven that she could not come back to his abode. He spat a blob of spit on her hand (or on her food in another version). The golden ladder (or golden stairs in another version) was also lifted up. Poor Tampha was abandoned from heaven. Salailen also took back his promises of immortality and immunity to disease.
Later, she lived in the outskirts of Konthoujam. Since then, she came to be known as Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi.

Søren Kierkegaards Plads is a harbourside public square on Slotsholmen in central Copenhagen, Denmark, named after Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. It occupies a strip of waterfront between the Black Diamond, whose main entrance faces the square, and the Frederiksholm Canal. Away from the water, the square is faced by Christian IV's Brewhouse as well as his old arsenal, now housing the Royal Military Museum. The thoroughfare Christians Brygge runs through the square which is connected to the water by "ghats" which also serve as seating for spectators for the occasional performances on a floating stage in the harbour basin.
History
It was laid out in 1999 in connection with the construction of the adjacent Black Diamond.
Artwork
Outside the Black Diamond is a fountain with a sculpture made by Mogens Møller and called the Monument of the Book. It was donated to the library in 1993 on the occasion of the library's 200 years anniversary as a public library.
In front of the arsenal building stands the Isted Lion but in 2009 it was decided that it will be returned to its original location in Flensburg, Germany.
In May 2009 a cast of Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen's sculpture of a mermaid from 1831 was erected in the square. The original is on display in the National Gallery.
There is also a sculpture by Elisabeth Toubro on the square

The Bury–Holcombe Brook line was a single-track railway line which ran between Bury Bolton Street railway station and Holcombe Brook railway station via seven intermediate stations, Woodhill Road Halt, Brandlesholme Road Halt, Woolfold, Sunny Wood Halt, Tottington, Knowles Halt, and Greenmount.
History
Opened in 1882 by the Bury and Tottington District Railway the line was taken over by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway in 1888. Initially the line had stations at Woolfold, Greenmount, Tottington and Holcombe Brook with additional halts opening at Woodhill Road, Brandlesholme Road, Sunnywood and Knowles Crossing in 1905.
Passenger services operated until 1952, while freight services continued to Holcombe Brook until 1960 and Tottington until 1963.
Electrification
In 1912 Dick, Kerr & Co.‘s Preston factory were considering tendering for a Brazilian contract and approached the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway to use the branch for test purposes at Dick, Kerr's expense. The line from Bury Bolton Street Station to Holcombe Brook was electrified with the overhead 3.5 kV dc system, rolling stock was also supplied at their cost. After prolonged trials the trains entered public use on 29 July 1913. The L&Y purchased the equipment and stock on the successful completion of the trials in 1916. During 1917 work started on the branch to convert to third rail to match the Manchester to Bury system. The third rail trains started to run on 29 March 1918.
Kirklees Trail
The section of the line from Greenmount to Bury town centre has been converted into a pedestrian and cycle route, the Kirklees Trail, forming part of National Cycle Route 6. Sustrans built a new long bridge over the Kirklees Valley to replace the demolished Woolfold viaduct.

Greifswalder FC is a German association football club from Greifswald, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
History
The club can be traced back to Greifswalder SC, which was founded in 1911, forcibly dissolved in 1945 and re-founded in 1990. Greifswalder SC had to file for insolvency in 2002 and was dissolved in 2003 after the insolvency proceedings were concluded; subsequently, Greifswalder SV was founded in 2004. Greifswalder FC was formed on 1 July 2015 through the merger of Greifswalder SV with Pommern Greifswald, after talks had already been held about a merger of the two clubs before the 2014–15 season. Pommern Greifswald's team was withdrawn from the NOFV-Oberliga Nord and the entire club was dissolved. The members joined Greifswalder SV, which was renamed Greifswalder FC.
Despite being eligible to play in the Oberliga, the club decided to take over the place of Greifswalder SV in the Verbandsliga Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. After two runner-up finishes in a row, Greifswalder FC was promoted to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord in the 2017–18 season. In the 2018–19 season, Greifswalder FC finished third behind Berlin-based clubs SV Lichtenberg and Tennis Borussia Berlin.

In Hawaiian mythology, the Kupua are a group of supernatural entities which might be considered gods or spirits (see also Atua).
Hawaiian myths and legends abound with such characters. They are traditionally described as monsters having the power of appearing in different kinds of bodies. They usually have cruel and vindictive characters and are ready to destroy and devour any persons they can catch. There are, however, many kupuas of kindly spirit who give watchful care to the members of their own families.
Many Hawaiian kupua are considered as gods having a double body, sometimes appearing as a man and sometimes being able to change shape, into an animal, vegetable, or mineral form. The latter form always possesses supernatural powers. William Westervelt mentions the following classification for kupua:
Ka-poe-kino-lau (the people who had leaf bodies)
Ka-poe-kino-pua (the people who had flower bodies)
Ka-poe-kino-manu (the people who had bird bodies)
Ka-poe-kino-laau (trees of all kinds, ferns, vines, etc.)
Ka-poe-kino-pupu (all shells)
Ka-poe-kino-ao (all clouds)
Ka-poe-kino-maani (all winds)
Ka-poe-kina-ia (all fish)
Ka-poe-kina-mano (all sharks)
Ka-poe-kina-limu (all sea-mosses)
Ka-poe-kina-pokaku (all peculiar stones)
Ka-poe-kina-hiwa-hiwa (all dangerous places of the pali)
Famous kupua in Hawaiian legends
Mamala the surf-rider was a chieftess of kupua character. She might appear as a shark, a lizard, or a woman. Her surfing skills were so impressive that people would gather on the beach to applaud her performance. She was married to the shark-man Ouha, but later left him for a chief named Hono-kau-pu.
In an old Honolulu legend, a kupua, who is a dog-man, overthrows the government of Kahanai and becomes the ruling power between Nuuanu Valley and the sea. He is a cannibal, and many of the people are killed and eaten by him. He can appear at will either as a man or a dog.
In Maui, the king once had a kupua, a rooster, which was very cruel and destructive. He could assume a different bird form for each magic power he possessed. This, with his miraculous human powers, made him superior to all the roosters which had ever been his antagonists in cock-fighting.
In Kauai, Akua-pehu-ale (god-of-the-swollen-billow) was a kupua who devoured his enemies and was greatly feared and hated even by his own tribe.
In the legend of the bread-fruit tree, Papa, one of the ancestors of the people living in all the islands now known as Polynesia, is described as a kupua. Her daughter Kap-ula-kinau also has kupua, or magic power.
Other Hawaiian kupua mentioned in the mythology include the famous trickster Māui, Iwa, Ono and Pekoi.

William Harvey Maddren (August 3, 1875 – January 8, 1909) was an American lacrosse coach and physician. He served as the fourth head coach of the Johns Hopkins University lacrosse team from 1897 to 1901 during which time his teams compiled a 25–6 record and captured three national championships.
Biography
The son of a doctor, Maddren was a native of Brooklyn, New York. He attended Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, from which he received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1896.
Maddren then studied medicine at Johns Hopkins University and received a medical doctorate in 1901. Maddren played lacrosse at Hopkins from 1897 to 1901, and in his first year there, was elected team captain and appointed as its player-coach. The Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association awarded Hopkins the national championship each year from 1898 to 1900.
In May 1904, Maddren returned to Baltimore to attend a medical clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and while there, also served as an assistant coach to Charles MacInnes for the game against Swarthmore College.
Alexander M. Weyand and Milton R. Roberts wrote in The Lacrosse Story that Maddren's efforts were largely responsible for "convert[ing] sedate Baltimore into a seething hotbed of lacrosse enthusiasm, the like of which had never been seen elsewhere in the United States."
Maddren died on January 8, 1909, at an age of 33. The National Lacrosse Hall of Fame inducted him in 1961.

Career
Mullin was born in Litherland, Merseyside. He spent time in the academies of both Everton and Liverpool and after a period in the Liverpool Foundation Football College, he moved to Huddersfield Town.
Huddersfield Town
Huddersfield Town's youth coach Frankie Bunn invited Mullin to the squad. Subsequently Mullin was signed to Huddersfield Town in 2012 after impressing at U18 and U21 level; he signed a one-year contract at the club. However, at the end of the 2013–14 season, Mullin was released by the club, without ever making a first team appearance.

He made his professional debut coming on as a second-half substitute in the League Cup first round defeat to Bradford City on 12 August 2014. Four days later, on his league debut, Mullin scored his first professional goal after coming on as a second-half substitute in the 3–2 win over Newport County, which he scored a winning goal. One week later, on 23 August, Mullin made his full debut scoring both goals in a 2–1 win away at Cambridge United. After scoring three goals in the first seven matches, Mullin signed a three-year contract with the club in mid-September. Then on 31 October 2014, Mullin would end his eleven games without scoring despite losing 2–1 to Accrington Stanley.

Tranmere drew Manchester United in the fourth round at home.
Cambridge United
Mullin signed for Cambridge United on a six-month loan deal on 31 January 2020, and scored his first goal for the club on 11 February 2020, away at Scunthorpe United. He scored again at Leyton Orient on 7 March, the last match before the season was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In July 2020, Mullin signed permanently on a one-year contract. On 20 October 2020, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–1 victory over Port Vale, taking his goal total to 11 in ten matches in all competitions. On 27 March 2021, Mullin scored his 25th league goal of the season in a 2–1 victory over Carlisle United, a goal which saw him break David Crown's record on the most league goals by a Cambridge United player in a season. As a gesture, club partners Mead renamed their stand the "Paul Mullin Stand", a name that would stay in place for the remainder of the 2020–21 season.
In April 2021, Mullin was nominated for the EFL League Two Player of the Season, before being announced as the winner at the EFL Awards on 29 April, where he was also named in the 2020–21 EFL League Two Team of the Season.Mullin was also awarded the League Two Golden boot after scoring 32 goals in Cambridge United's 2020–21 campaign, in which they secured promotion to the third tier of English football, a record number for the division since its rebranding in 2004.
Wrexham
At the end of the 2020–21 season Mullin rejected a new contract offer with Cambridge United and in July 2021 joined National League side Wrexham on a three-year deal. After scoring three goals across the course of the month, including a vital winner against FC Halifax Town, Mullin was awarded the league's Player of the Month award for November 2021. Mullin continued to have a successful first season at Wrexham, winning Wrexham Men's Team Top Goalscorer, Player of the Season, and Goal of the Season awards as well as the National League's Golden Boot and Player of the Season.

Czech Sign Language is the sign language of the deaf community in the Czech Republic. It presumably emerged around the time of the first deaf school in Bohemia (1786). It belongs to the French sign-language family and is partially intelligible with French sign language. Despite the similarity of oral Czech and Slovak, it is not particularly close to Slovak Sign Language.

The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute is a body at Karolinska Institute which awards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. It is headquartered in the Nobel Forum on the grounds of the Karolinska Institute campus. Originally the Nobel Assembly was not a formal body but rather the collective of all professors (holders of chairs, i.e. full professors) at Karolinska Institute. In 1977 the Nobel Assembly became a separate private organization hosted by Karolinska Institute. Until 1984 all Karolinska Institute professors belonged to the Assembly; from 1984 the membership is restricted to 50 Karolinska Institute professors.
The main work involved in collecting nominations and screening nominees is performed by the Nobel Committee at the Karolinska Institute, which has five members. The Nobel Committee, which is appointed by the Nobel Assembly, is only empowered to recommend laureates, while the final decision rests with the Nobel Assembly.
Background
The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was first awarded in 1901. For most of the 20th century the laureates were decided upon by all professors of the Karolinska Institute, collectively sometimes also referred to as the Nobel Assembly. In 1977 the Nobel Assembly was established as a separate private organization. The reason for creating a special formal body for the decisions concerning the Nobel Prize was the fact that the Karolinska Institute is a state-run university, which in turn means that it is subject to various laws that apply to government agencies in Sweden and similar Swedish public sector organisations, such as freedom of information legislation. By moving the actual decision making to a private body at Karolinska Institute (but not part of it), it is possible to follow the regulations for the Nobel Prize set down by the Nobel Foundation, including keeping the confidentiality of all documents and proceedings for a minimum of 50 years. Also, the legal possibility of contesting the decisions in e.g. administrative courts is removed. Until 1984 all professors at Karolinska Institute were members of the Assembly, but in 1984 the membership was restricted to 50 Karolinska professors.
The other two Nobel Prize-awarding bodies in Sweden, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Swedish Academy, are legally private organisations (although enjoying royal patronage), and have therefore not had to make any special arrangements to be able to follow the Nobel Foundation's regulations.

Colonel Ferdinand-Isaac de Rovéréa (Vevey, 10 February 1763 -- Baveno, 8 August 1829 ) was a Swiss military officer and counter-revolutionary, who fought in French and British service during the French Revolutionary Wars.
Biography
After serving in Erlachts' Swiss with the French army, Rovéréa enrolled in the service of the canton of Bern.
In February 1798, Rovéréa constituted a 600-man strong "Faithful Legion" (Légion fidèle) to defend Bern against Revolutionary influence from France. On 5 March, French troops invaded Switzerland, capturing the city of Bern, and Rovéréa gave battle near Nidau; he surrendered three days later in Thielle.
The next year, Rovéréa was exiled to Germany, where he constituted a 14-company regiment fighting with the British, comprising two chasseur companies. They took part in several battles, sustaining heavy casualties.
Rovéréa returned to Switzerland in 1801, and became one of the leaders of the Aristocratic Party of Vaud. He eventually came to terms with the independence of Vaud from Bern.

Bernhard VIII, Count of Lippe (6 December 1527 in Detmold – 15 April 1563 in Detmold) was from 1547 until his death in 1563 ruling the County of Lippe.
Life
Bernard's father, the reigning Count Simon V of Lippe, died in 1536, when Bernard was eight years old. Since he was too young take over at this age, the country was ruled by a regency council consisting of Landgrave Philip I of Hesse, Count Adolph of Schaumburg and Count Jobst II of Hoya. Bernhard was raised in the Lutheran faith.
In 1546 he joined the government of the county of Lippe and during his reign, he tried especially to strengthen the Lutheran faith in his county. This met with disapproval of the Emperor Charles V, whose troops occupied Lippe in the course of the Schmalkaldic War (1546–1547) and after the defeat of the Protestant side in 1548, began implementing the Augsburg Interim. As a result, Lippe became an imperial fief.
In 1555, Bernard visited the Diet of Augsburg in person, and in 1556, he convened a meeting of the Protestant clergy in his county. Also in 1556, he declared war on Count John II of Rietberg. Bernard besieged John's court in 1557. In 1559, Bernhard gave Sternberg Castle to his brother Herman Simon as a Paréage. This triggered an inheritance dispute with the County of Schaumburg.
Marriage and issue
His marriage to Catherine (1524–1583), daughter of the Count Philip III of Waldeck-Eisenberg produced following children:
Anna (1551–1614)
married in 1576 Count Wolfgang II of Everstein-Massow
Magdalene (1552–1587)
married in 1572 Landgrave Georges I of Hesse-Darmstadt (1547–1596)
Simon VI of Lippe-Brake (1554–1613).
married firstly, in 1578, Countess Armgard of Rietberg-Arnsberg (1551–1584)
married secondly, in 1585, Countess Elisabeth of Holstein-Schauenburg (1566-1638)
Bernhardine (1563–1628)

The C35 class was a class of steam locomotives built by Eveleigh Railway Workshops between 1914 and 1923 for the New South Wales Government Railways in Australia. Despite their elegant, somewhat English looking appearance, they suffered a long period of teething troubles and were poor performers, especially on long climbs.
In service
They took over hauling The Fish, from Sydney Central to Mount Victoria in June 1918 and the Caves Express on the same route in 1932. To operate this, 3506, 3526 and 3535 were painted in Caledonian Blue to match the carriages.
After being replaced by 36 class locomotives on Southern and Western services, they were transferred to operate North Coast and Northern Tablelands express and mail trains until replaced by diesels in the 1950s. The first was withdrawn in February 1959. During the last years of service, they were confined to working both passenger and freight trains north of Gosford on the Main North line. The last was withdrawn in August 1968.
Modifications
In May 1935, an ACFI feedwater heater was fitted to 3508. It was apparently not a success as it was removed in 1939 and no other member was so fitted.
From December 1937, the class was rebuilt with heavier frames, rebalanced driving wheels, new boilers and new cabs with more shelter, replacing their Great Western Railway look.

The Oakland Athletics are a Major League Baseball (MLB) team based in Oakland, California. They play in the American League West division. The club was founded in Philadelphia in 1901, moved to Kansas City, Missouri in 1955 and relocated to Oakland in 1968. The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day.
Since their arrival in Oakland, the A's home field has been the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, a multi-purpose stadium that has also been used for football, and soccer games. Commonly referred to as The Oakland Coliseum, or simply The Coliseum, it was formerly known as Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum (1966–1998, Present), Network Associates Coliseum (1998–2004) and McAfee Coliseum (2004–2008). The's played their 1996 Opening Day game at Cashman Field in Las Vegas, Nevada while repairs at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum were being completed, the first time in 39 years that a major league team played in a minor-league ballpark.
In Oakland, the A's have used 32 different Opening Days starting pitchers in their 52 seasons. The 32 starters have a combined Opening Day record of 16 wins, 19 losses and 17 no decisions. No decisions are only awarded to the starting pitcher if the game is won or lost after the starting pitcher has left the game or if the starting pitcher pitches fewer than five innings. Of the 17 no decisions, the A's went on to win seven and lose ten of those games, for a team record on Opening Day of 23 wins and 29 losses.
Since it moved to Oakland, the team has played 36 of their Opening Day games at home: 33 at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, 3 in Tokyo, and once in Las Vegas. Of the 33 games played in Oakland, the A's starting pitchers have a record of 12 wins, 9 losses and 12 no decisions (the team won seven and lost six of these no decisions). The 1996 game at Las Vegas' Cashman Field was a loss for starter Carlos Reyes. The 2008 game in the Tokyo Dome was a no decision for starter Joe Blanton that ended in an A's loss. The 2012 Tokyo Dome game resulted in a no decision for starter Brandon McCarthy and a loss for the team. Mike Fiers took the loss in the 2019 Tokyo Dome opener. Overall, the team's starting pitchers' record in home games is 12–11 (with 14 no decisions).
The's have advanced to the playoffs 18 times while in Oakland, winning the American League Championship Series six times and going on to win the World Series in 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1989. In the 18 seasons that the A's advanced to the playoffs, the team's Opening Day starting pitchers have had a record of eight wins, four losses and six no decisions; the team ultimately won three and lost three of the no decisions. The team's starters won four and lost one Opening Day game in the six seasons they advanced to the World Series.
Catfish Hunter was the team's first Opening Day starter after the team moved to Oakland, taking a 3–1 loss to the Baltimore Orioles at Memorial Stadium in 1968.

Video game
In the Game Boy action video game based on the film, the divorced father is looking for a Tasmanian tiger while trying to survive in the harsh wilderness of Tasmania. Players can choose between two "types" of levels; slow levels or fast levels. Either jumping on the enemies or using the bombs kills them instantly. Players are limited in the number of bombs that they receive in the game. Certain enemies are worth more than others when defeated. Other animals like koalas appear in the game as bonus characters. However, these bonus creatures tend to disappear very quickly.
This game is a port of Pony Canyon's Fruit Panic for the MSX which plays similar to the classic arcade game Mappy. All plants must be collected and animals must be cleared off the level before players can begin the next level; there are approximately ten levels in this game. While the "A" button is used to plant bombs on the screen; the "Select" button is used to choose the level (and make the Tasmanian tiger either slower or faster). It is possible to stun the Tasmanian tiger with a bomb attack.

Sporobolus heterolepis, commonly known as prairie dropseed, is a species of prairie grass native to the tallgrass and mixed grass prairies of central North America from Texas to southern Canada. It is also found further east, to the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada, but is much less common beyond the Great Plains and is restricted to specialized habitats. It is found in 27 states and four Canadian provinces.
Description
Prairie dropseed is a perennial bunchgrass whose mound of leaves is typically from high and across. Its flowering stems (culms) grow from tall, extending above the leaves.
The flower cluster is an airy panicle long with many branches. They terminate in small spikelets, which each contain a single fertile floret. When it blooms, the floret has three reddish anthers and a short feathery stigma. If it is pollinated, the floret produces a nearly round seed long.
At the base of the spikelet are two bracts (glumes), one of them long and the other long. The bracts each are long and tapered, with sharply pointed tips. Around the floret are a lemma and palea, each about long, though the palea is sometimes longer than the lemma.
Prairie dropseed is a fine-textured grass with long, narrow leaves that arch outward, forming attractive, round tufts. The leaves range in color from a rich green hue in summer to a golden rust color in the fall. Foliage is resilient enough to resist flattening by snow, so it provides year-round interest. From late July to mid-September, the grass blooms with rusty-tan flowers that rise in height.
It occurs in a wide range of soils, doing well in moist to dry conditions. It is much less common in wetlands.
Ecology
It is a larval host to the Poweshiek skipper.
Uses
The grass is cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens because of its attractive bunchgrass form. Because of its drought tolerance, it has been used on green roofs. The seedhead is sometimes described as having the vague scent of fresh popcorn, cilantro, or sunflower seeds.
Prairie dropseed is also used for roadside revegetation and prairie restoration projects. It is difficult to establish by direct seeding. Transplanting greenhouse-grown seedlings is a more effective method of establishing it.
Native Americans ground the seeds of the grass to make flour, and many species of birds eat the seeds.

The Learjet Model 35 and Model 36 are a series of American multi-role business jets and military transport aircraft manufactured by Learjet. When used by the United States Air Force they carry the designation C-21A.
The aircraft are powered by two Garrett TFE731-2 turbofan engines. Its cabin can be arranged for six to eight passengers. The longer-range Model 36 has a shortened passenger area to provide more space in the aft fuselage for fuel tanks.
The engines are mounted in nacelles on the sides of the aft fuselage. The wings are equipped with single-slotted flaps. The wingtip fuel tanks distinguish the design from other aircraft having similar functions.
Development
The concept which became the LJ35 began as the Learjet 25BGF (with GF referring to "Garrett Fan"), a Learjet 25 with a then-new TFE731 turbofan engine mounted on the left side in place of the 25's General Electric CJ610 turbojet engine. This testbed aircraft first flew in May, 1971. As a result of the increased power and reduced noise of the new engine, Learjet further improved the design, and instead of being simply a variant of the 25, it became its own model, the 35.
By 2018, 1980s Learjet 35As start at $500,000.
Operational history
In 1976 American professional golfer Arnold Palmer used a Learjet 36 to establish a new round-the-world class record of 22,894 miles (36990 km) completed in 57 hours 25 minutes 42 seconds.
Learjet 35s made the bulk of Escuadrón Fénix flights during the 1982 Falklands War mainly on diversion flights.
Production on the 35/36 series ceased in 1994.
, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board database lists 25 fatal accidents for the 35/35A, and two for the 36/36A.
Variants
Learjet 35
The original Model 35 was powered by two TFE731-2-2A engines and was 13 inches longer than its predecessor, the Model 25. First flight of the prototype Model 35 was on 22 August 1973, and the aircraft was FAA certified in July, 1974. It could carry up to eight passengers. There were 64 base-model 35s built.
Learjet 35A
The Model 35A is an upgraded Model 35 with TFE731-2-2B engines and a range of 2,789 miles, with a fuel capacity of 931 US gallons (3,524 L) with refueling accomplished at ground level through each wingtip tank. It was introduced in 1976, replacing the 35. Over 600 35As were built, with a production line that ended with serial number 677, in 1993.
On February 12, 1996, a Learjet 35A, N10BD, owned by Cable Television Founder Bill Daniels and piloted by Mark E. Calkins, Charles Conrad, Jr., Paul Thayer, and D. Miller completed an around-the-world flight in a record 49 hrs, 21 min, and 8 sec. The record remains standing . This aircraft is now on display in Terminal C of Denver International Airport.
Learjet 36
The Model 36 is essentially identical to the 35, except that it has a larger fuselage fuel tank, giving it 500 miles longer range, but reducing the passenger area's length by 18 inches (0.46 m). It was certified, along with the 35, in July, 1974.
Learjet 36A
Like the 35A, the Model 36A has upgraded engines and a higher maximum gross weight. It was introduced in 1976, replacing the 36.
Military variants
C-21A
The C-21A is a United States military designation for an "off the shelf" variant of the Learjet 35A for the United States Air Force, with room for eight passengers and 42 ft3 (1.26 m3) of cargo. In addition to its normal role, the aircraft is capable of transporting litters during medical evacuations. Delivery of the C-21A fleet began in April 1984 and was completed in October 1985.
There are 38 Air Force active duty aircraft, and 18 Air National Guard aircraft in the C-21A fleet. On 1 April 1997, all continental U.S.-based C-21As were realigned under Air Mobility Command, with the 375th Airlift Wing at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, as the lead command. C-21As stationed outside the continental United States are assigned to the theater commanders.
U-36
A Japanese military designation for a Combat support variant of the Learjet 35A for the Japan Air self Defense Force (JASDF). At least six built.
U-36A
A Japanese military designation not a U.S. military designation. Utility transport, training version of the Learjet 35A. Equipped with a missile seeker simulator in addition to a radar, avionics, firing training assessment devices, an ejector pylon, a special communications system, a target towing system and a jammer system. Four were built for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force.
Notable accidents and incidents
On 7 June 1982, during the Falklands War, a Learjet 35 of Argentina's Escuadrón Fénix was shot down by HMS Exeter. The aircraft had been participating in a reconnaissance mission when it was hit by a Sea Dart surface-to-air missile launched by the destroyer. All five crew were killed.
On 13 February 1983, a Learjet 35A carrying Sri Lankan business tycoon Upali Wijewardene disappeared over the Straits of Malacca (Malaysia). The wreckage has never been found, nor any trace of Wijewardene, his top executives, or crew.
On 17 September 1994, a Learjet 35A owned by Golden Eagle Aviation was accidentally shot down by the Republic of China Navy while being used as a target tug. All 4 crew on board were killed.
On 17 April 1995, a C-21 crashed into a wooded area near Alexander City, Alabama killing the two pilots and six passengers, including Clark G. Fiester, assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, and Major General Glenn A Profitt II.
The 1996 New Hampshire Learjet 35A crash on Christmas Eve, 24 December, lead to the longest missing aircraft search in that state's history, lasting almost three years, and eventually resulted in Congressional legislation mandating improved emergency locator transmitters (ELTs) be installed in U.S.-registered business jets.
On 29 August 1999, a U.S. registered Learjet 35A owned by Corporate Jets, Inc., was shot down near Adwa, Ethiopia, while flying from Luxor, Egypt, to Nairobi, Kenya, with the loss of three persons.
On 25 October 1999, professional golfer Payne Stewart was killed in the crash of a Learjet 35. The plane apparently suffered a loss of cabin pressure at some point early in the flight. All on board are thought to have died of hypoxia, lack of oxygen. The plane, apparently still on autopilot, continued flying until one engine flamed out, most likely due to fuel starvation. It crashed near Aberdeen, South Dakota after an uncontrolled descent. The exact cause of the pressurization failure and the reason behind the crew's failure or inability to respond to it has not been definitively determined.
On 9 March 2006 Argentine Air Force Learjet 35A serial T-21 struck terrain and broke up shortly after takeoff from El Alto International Airport in La Paz, Bolivia killing all 6 on board. The Learjet was sent to Bolivia to deliver humanitarian aid.
On 4 November 2007, a Learjet 35A crashed in São Paulo, Brazil, after a failed takeoff attempt. It destroyed a house in a residential area near the Campo de Marte Airport, killing the pilot, co-pilot and 6 family members who were in the house.
On 24 June 2014, a Learjet 35A of the Gesellschaft für Flugzieldarstellung (GFD) was involved in a mid-air collision with a Eurofighter Typhoon of the German Air Force and crashed at Olsberg, Germany.
On 9 November 2014, a private Learjet 36 crashed in Freeport, Grand Bahamas, Bahamas. The jet struck a shipping crane at the Grand Bahama shipyard, exploding on impact and crashing into the ground near a junkyard area. The plane was en route from the Lynden Pindling International Airport with nine people on board heading to Grand Bahama International Airport. All nine persons perished, including Myles Munroe, a Bahamian pastor.
On 15 May 2017, Learjet 35A aircraft N452DA was on a repositioning flight from Philadelphia to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, near New York City. The two pilots were killed after the aircraft stalled and crashed into a warehouse while circling to land. The NTSB investigation cited pilot error in continuing an unstable approach.
On 27 December 2021, Learjet 35 aircraft N880Z was en route to Gillespie Field (KSEE) in El Cajon, California, near San Diego when it crashed onto a nearby street, killing all four occupants.
On July 1, 2022, a sanitary Learjet 35A, registration LV-BPA suffered an accident at the Río Grande Gob. Ramón Trejo Noel airport, in the Province of Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica and South Atlantic Islands, Argentina, killing all four occupants.

Pitshanger (sometimes referred to as Pitshanger Village) is a small but busy local suburb, centred on the shops in Pitshanger Lane, located about 1 mile north of Ealing Broadway in west London. First mentioned in 1493, possibly meaning an area of sloped woodland frequented by birds. It contains numerous small independent shops, several cafes, two pubs, two churches, a school, and a park (Pitshanger Park), and is often taken to also include parts of the nearby Brentham Garden Suburb.
Amenities
Pitshanger Lane (originally Pitshanger Road) is one of the busiest roads in Ealing, and provides a wide range of shops. The Pitshanger Village Library has recently been improved and the Lane is furnished with touch-screen computers. A Methodist and an Anglican church are both located at the end of the Lane. Due to its large size and possession of a Bösendorfer grand piano, St. Barnabas (Church of England) is the venue for, besides the usual services, a series of classical music concerts given by local musicians and others. These include regular recitals every Friday lunchtime. Attendance is free with a retiring collection. The current vicar of St Barnabas is Father Justin Dodd; the Director of Music is Kavi Pau and the Assistant Director of Music is Henry Tozer who runs a gospel choir. Away from Pitshanger Lane, the Pitshanger area features Pitshanger Park, which includes allotments for locals' use. Featuring two children's playground areas, football goalposts, a bowling green and several tennis courts, Pitshanger Park caters for both children and adults.
Schooling also exists on Pitshanger Lane, with North Ealing Primary School located at one end of the Lane. The school is a comprehensive, co-education school for pupils up to the age of eleven. St. Gregory's R.C. School is also coeducational and located just off Pitshanger Lane.
In May 2016, Pitshanger Lane was named London's best high street by The Great British High Street, and a plaque was unveiled.
Transport
The area is served by buses E2 and E9 and night bus N7.

Haji Mohammad Rosanan bin Abdullah Samak (born 18 July 1965) is a Bruneian football coach and former player, who played as a striker most notably with the Brunei team that played in the Malaysian league in the 1990s. He was a member of the team that won the 1999 Malaysia Cup, which is regarded as Brunei football's crowning achievement.
Club and coaching career
Rosanan started his career with the Bruneian team Kota Ranger FC, the team won the domestic championship in 1987 and participated in that year's Asian Champions' Cup (an early edition of the AFC Champions League). Kota Ranger also won the BAFA-Standard Chartered Football League in 1992 and Rosanan was the top scorer. At the turn of the decade, he was selected to play for the Brunei team competing in Liga Semi-Pro Malaysia. His 10-year career with the Wasps culminated in the shock 2-1 win against Sarawak in the final of the 1999 Malaysia Cup. This achievement was chronicled in FIFA 192: The True Story Behind the Legend of Brunei Darussalam National Football Team, a book by British author Stanley Park.
Rosanan left the national representative side in 2000. He returned to Kota Ranger as player-coach a year later, and was also given opportunities to coach Bruneian exhibition sides at the time. He hung up his boots in 2003 and moved to AH United a year later, starting a six-year tenure in which he won the Brunei FA Cup in 2006.
Hired by BAFA as a coach in 2009, Rosanan was assigned various coaching positions since, such as the Brunei Youth Team that played in the domestic league (2009–2011), the Under-21s (2012), and the Under-15s as assistant coach (2013). He was assistant to Kwon Oh-son for the Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy competitions for the U21s in 2012 and 2014. He received the Order of Setia Negara Brunei Fourth Class for his part in winning the competition in 2012.
In the 2021 Brunei Super League season, he coached Panchor Murai FC.
Between March and September 2022, he was the head coach of the Brunei national football team, taking charge of friendlies against Laos and Malaysia.
International career
Rosanan scored a goal against Thailand national football team in a 5–2 defeat at the 17th SEA Games in Singapore on 11 June 1993.
Rosanan played for Brunei's national team at the 1999 SEA Games held at home, and played all six matches at the 2002 World Cup qualifying campaign without scoring a goal.

The Massachusetts General Law Chapter 93H and its new regulations 201 CMR 17.00 require that any companies or persons who store or use personal information (PI) about a Massachusetts resident develop a written, regularly audited plan to protect personal information. Both electronic and paper records will need to comply with the new law. The regulations went into effect on March 1, 2010. The law was originally supposed to go into effect on January 1, 2009, but then was pushed to May 1 and then January 1, 2010 and then to March 1, 2010 due to the state of the economy and confusion about the law.
Identity theft and fraud are the major concerns at the core of the implementation of the 201 CMR 17.00. For example, if a Massachusetts resident's information is leaked or captured, there could be serious consequences for the business that allowed the breach and for the individual whose information was leaked. Therefore, making changes to keep residents' information secure will be required to avoid security breach and fines.
According to the regulations, companies will need a written security plan to safeguard their contacts' and/or employees personal information. It will need to be illustrative of policies that demonstrate technical, physical, and administrative protection for residents' information. The plan will need to be written to meet industry standards. Companies will have to designate employees to oversee and manage security procedures in the workplace, as well as continuously monitor and address security hazards. Policies addressing employee access to and transportation of personal information will need to be developed, as well as disciplinary measures for employees who do not conform to the new regulations. Limiting the collection of data to the minimum that is needed for the purpose it will be used for is also part of the new regulations.

His first television appearance was on the Discovery Kids reality show, Endurance. He appeared on the 4th season when he was 12 (making him the youngest contestant on the show) in the show, he made himself seem like a huge threat, which other contestants took seriously, although he was eliminated after the first elimination. Chris's talent was quickly recognized by talent agent, Joy Pervis, who also discovered child stars Dakota Fanning, Kyle Massey, and Lucas Till. He stayed busy working in the Atlanta market booking commercials, print, television, and films. Chris has been cast in several movies, including Big Momma's House 2, and he has a recurring role on Tyler Perry's television series, Meet the Browns. Chris's big break came when he was cast for the lead role of Lance in the Disney Channel original movie, Avalon High.

Mokhadarat Vatan Association (), was a feminist society that was formed in 1910 during the Iranian Constitutional Revolution and the national movements happening in the 1900s. The aim of this association was to organize various activities for Iranian independence from the sovereignty of foreign countries. The members of the association were active in the meetings and demonstrations of the constitutional movement. They also wrote protest letters to the Russian Government about their imperialist actions.
History
During the Constitutional Revolution, many secret and semi-congressional associations in Iran were established. Many women's associations were also secretly formed in the constitutional movement. (Later, in the years following the governmental assembly and in World War II, associations were set up that focused on women's rights).
Mokhadarat Vatan Association and similar organizations held massive meetings on the role of women in the 1911 National Movement to banish British Empire and Russia from Iran. They opposed the 1907 treaty, which imposed Iran under the influence of Britain and Russia, incite imports of imported goods, and went to cafes to reduce sugar imports. They even tried to stop them from using foreign sugar, and asked the cafes to shut down in order to reduce consumption.
The members of the Mokhadarat Vatan Association considered exploitation of foreign countries as the main cause of the underlying position of women in Iran at that time. Their main goal was not to only emphasize on women's rights, but also dominate Iran's independence from other countries.
For example, in one of the meetings between women's associations and the Russian delegation, the panel was trying to persuade women that they should not try to protect the independence of Iran since they did not have the Persian Constitution of 1906 of women's rights in Iran. But, the response of the women's groups was that they themselves were dissatisfied with their own circumstances, but the main culprit was the political complexity of the presence of foreign powers. This attitude was later seen in women's political activists of the 1979 Revolution.
Members
At the first meeting, the board of directors of this association was elected: Agha Bigam Najmabadi, daughter of Agha Sheikh Hadi Najmabadi as the chairman, Agha Shahzadeh Amin as the treasurer, and Sediqeh Dowlatabadi as the secretary.
Other prominent members that we can refer to were: Mirza Suleiman Khan Mikdah's wife, Dr. Mehdikhan Mikdah's mother, spouse of Malik Al-Mutkelimen (Senator Dr. Malikzadeh's mother), Nehzat Jahangir, Efat Al-Muluk Khaje Noori, Nazam Al-Muluk Khaje Noori, Mr. Sayed Kazem Rashti's wife, Zinat Aldoleh, Gulshan Al-Muluk Ghahramani, Iran Khanoom (Etela Al-Malek's wife, daughter of Mashhār Al-Saltanah Ghadimi), Mirza Kazem Khoshnevis's wife, Sedigh Al-Saltanah's wife, Sardar Afgham's daughter, Sepahsalar Tonekaboni's daughter, Mofakham Al-Mamalek's wife, Mirza Hassan Roshdieh's wife (Alavieh khanoom), Notagh Al-Nesvan (Sheikh Al Mamalek Orang's sister), Dorat Al Ma'ali (Founder of Dorat School), Homa Mahmoudi, Mahrokh Goharshenas (Sister of the Industrial Director), and Amirsahi Mahsoltan (Women's rights activists).

The Potez VIII was a French training aircraft which first flew in 1920. Originally it had a very unusual vertical inline engine and a four-wheeled undercarriage, though the production version was more conventional.
Design and development
The Potez VIII as first displayed, unflown, at the 1919 Paris Salon was a conventional small, single engine aircraft of its time apart from a most unusual engine and an unconventional undercarriage. It was a single bay biplane with rectangular plan wings mounted without stagger but with marked dihedral and braced with a pair of parallel, airfoil section interplane struts. A pair of inverted V cabane struts, parallel to each other, joined the central section of the upper wing to the upper fuselage longerons. There were ailerons on the upper wing only. The wings were duralumin two spar structures with fabric covering.
The Potez VIII had a simple, flat-sided fuselage with a wooden structure and plywood skinning. There were tandem open cockpits, the forward one under the upper wing, which was mounted well above it, and the other just aft of the trailing edge, which had a rounded cut-out to assist the pilot's upward vision. The empennage was conventional, with a tailplane on the upper fuselage and a broad chord, swept-edge fin wire braced to it. The tail structure was similar to that of the wing, with a metal frame and fabric covering.
The engine of the 1919 aircraft was also a Potez design, the A-4. This was a four-cylinder inline built to run with its crankshaft vertical. It was mounted with its exposed cylinders pointing forwards for cooling and had gearing that turned the output through 90° to drive a two-blade propeller. Although the Potez A-4 was unsuccessful, its configuration produced the high power line and low centre of gravity of later inverted inline engines, allowing a shorter undercarriage, easier access to the cockpits and a better forward view over a shorter, lower nose than its inline contemporaries. The high propeller shaft also allowed a shorter undercarriage; a four-wheeled unit protected the propeller tips from contact with the ground.
The A-4 engined Potez VIII first flew on 19 April 1920. When its engine was recognised as a failure the A-4 was replaced by a six-cylinder Anzani radial engine, mounted uncowled in the nose. An early version produced and a later variant . Initially the four wheel undercarriage was retained but when the Potez VIII appeared at the 1922 Paris Salon it had more conventional two wheel gear. The wheels were on a single axle. From each end of the axle a strut ran to the underside of the forward fuselage, acting together with a vertical telescopic, rubber damped shock absorber. At least one example flew as a floatplane, designated Potez VIII H (H for hydravion or water plane). It had a single, central float and a small, airfoil section stabilizing float under each wing.
A side-by-side version was also built and designated the Potez VIII R; it was a little heavier, with a wider fuselage and powered by a fully cowled Le Rhone 9C engine. It returned to the four wheel undercarriage.
Reconstructed pre-World War II civil registers suggest about fifteen powered Potez VIIIs were built. There was also a glider version, the Potez VIII P (P for planeur or glider) with a smooth aluminium nosecap in place of the engine. This was slightly () longer and lighter with an empty weight of compared with the of the Anzani powered version. It was the overall winner at the First Glider Congress, held in Clermont-Ferrand, which ended on 30 August 1922.
The powered version also had competition success, coming second in the first La Coupe de Consummation d'Aviation Zénith (The Zénith Cup for Aircraft Fuel Consumption), based on a return flight from Paris to Lyon flown over 21–22 August 1923. The deciding parameter was the ratio of weight of fuel used to payload. The Potez scored 0.616, the winner, a Farman F.90, 0.473.
Four Potez VIIIs were registered in Bulgaria.

Uet era Ngermeuangel (Ngermeuangel Lake, Big Jellyfish Lake) is a marine lake located on Koror island in Palau. There are about 70 other marine lakes located throughout the Rock Islands and Koror. Uet era Ngermeuangel is notable for endemic subspecies of golden jellyfish and is one of five marine lakes in Palau used for several scientific researches in evolutionary biology the other lakes being Jellyfish Lake, Clear Lake (Palau), Goby Lake, Uet era Ongael.
Golden jellyfish
Uet era Ngermeuangel is connected to the ocean through fissures and tunnels in the limestone of ancient Miocene reef. However the lake is sufficiently isolated and the conditions are different enough that the diversity of species in the lake is greatly reduced from the nearby lagoon. The golden jellyfish Mastigias cf. papua remeliiki and possibly other species in the lake have evolved to be substantially different from their close relatives living in the nearby lagoons. In the lake there is living also jellyfish Aurelia sp.
Lake stratification
Uet era Ngermeuangel is a deep, comparatively ancient (12,000–15,000 years old) lake, stratified into two layers, an oxygenated upper layer (mixolimnion) and a lower anoxic layer (monimolimnion). The oxygen concentration in the lake declines from about 6 mg/L at the surface to zero at 18 meters (at the chemocline). Stratification is persistent and seasonal mixing does not occur. The lake is one of about 200 saline meromictic lakes that have been identified in the world. Most of these lakes are of freshwater origin. Permanently stratified marine lakes are unusual, but in Palau there are eleven other such lakes. The most renowned one is Jellyfish Lake.

The Charlotte Checkers were a minor league professional ice hockey team based in Charlotte, North Carolina. The team began as the Baltimore Clippers in 1954, playing in the Eastern Hockey League. When the arena in Baltimore burned down, the team briefly played as the Charlotte Rebels, before permanently relocating to the Charlotte Coliseum in 1956, becoming the Charlotte Clippers. The team was renamed the Checkers in 1960, and played its final four seasons in the Southern Hockey League, before folding in 1977. The Clippers/Checkers franchise won five playoff championships in its existence, and were the first team to be based in the Southeast United States.
Baltimore, 1954–1956
The Baltimore Clippers began play in the Eastern Hockey League during the 1954–55 season, with Andy Brown as coach. Herve Lalonde led the team, scoring 22 goals, and 50 assists, winning the John Carlin Trophy, as the league's top scorer. In the playoffs, Baltimore defeated the Clinton Comets 3 games to 1 in the first round, but lost the finals in four straight games to the Washington Lions. On January 23, 1956, midway through the Clippers' second season, their home arena, Carlin's Iceland, burned down.
Charlotte Rebels, 1956
Without an arena, the Clippers searched for a temporary home to finish the season. Local businessmen in Charlotte offered the one-year-old Charlotte Coliseum as a temporary site. The Baltimore Clippers played six of their remaining 12 games in Charlotte, using the name Rebels. The first professional hockey game in Charlotte was played on January 30, 1956, attended by 10,363 fans, with approximately 3,000 more unable to find a ticket. The Rebels lost the game 6–2, to the New Haven Blades. The six games played in Charlotte by the Rebels drew more than 40,000 fans. By comparison, the Clippers typically drew 2,000 fans per game in Baltimore. The combined record of the Clippers and Rebels was 47 points for fifth place, missing the playoffs.
Charlotte Clippers, 1956–1960
Buoyed by the Rebels' strong attendance figures in Charlotte, owner Charles Rock chose to move the team there full-time for the following season as the Charlotte Clippers. In the 1956–57 season, the Clippers earned 101 points, to finish first place, and win the Walker Cup as regular season champions. The season included a winning streak of 21 games before the playoffs, and the team earning the nickname, "Dixie Dandies." Al O'Hearn lead the league in scoring with 46 goals, 71 assists, and 117 points, to win the John Carlin Trophy. In the playoffs, Charlotte defeated the New Haven Blades in six games in the first round, and defeated the Philadelphia Ramblers in seven games, to win the Atlantic City Boardwalk Trophy as playoff champions.
In the 1957–58 season, Charlotte repeated first place in the regular season with 77 points, and a second Walker Cup. In the playoffs, Charlotte defeated the New Haven Blades in seven games in the first round, but lost in the finals to the Washington Presidents in seven games.
In the 1958–59 season, Charlotte dropped to sixth place, and missed the playoffs. The team also ran into financial troubles, which led to the Charlotte Coliseum Authority taking over the team in 1959. A citizen's group raised $25,000 from stockholders, to keep the team on the ice.
In the 1959–60 season, coach Andy Brown moved on, and the EHL split into northern and southern divisions. Evel Knievel tried out with the Clippers in 1959, but decided that a traveling team was not for him. Pete Horeck led the team as a player-coach, the Clippers finished second place in the south, won the first round playoff series in three games versus the Greensboro Generals, and lost to the Johnstown Jets in the second round.
Charlotte Checkers
Eastern Hockey League, 1960–1973
The team was renamed the Charlotte Checkers, resulting from a name-the-team contest. Gordon Tottle became the player-coach, and despite the new name, Charlotte finished fourth place and missed the playoffs in the 1960–61 season. Joe Crozier was named coach in the 1961–62 season, but the team still finished fourth place and missed the playoffs. He returned for the 1962–63 season, and the Checkers placed third in the southern division. In the playoffs, Charlotte upset the second place Knoxville Knights in five games, then lost in five games to the Greensboro Generals in the second round. Turk Broda took over the coaching duties for the 1963–64 season, and led the team to a fourth-place finish in the south, and a first round playoff loss to Greensboro in three games.
Fred Creighton was brought in to coach for the 1964–65 season, beginning eight years at the helm of the Checkers. He improved the team to third place in the south, but the team still lost in the first round to the Nashville Dixie Flyers in three games. Creighton improved the team to 42 wins in the 1965–66 season, and second place in the south. In the playoffs, Charlotte defeated Greensboro in five games in the first round, then lost in four games straight to Nashville in the second round. Charlotte repeated a second-place finish in the 1966–67 season, then defeated Greensboro in three games in the first round of the playoffs, but lost to Nashville in five games in the second round. The Checkers won 42 games, and earned 93 points in the 1967–68 season, and finished second place in the south. Charlotte defeated Nashville in four games in the first round of the playoffs, and defeated Greensboro in six games in the second round. In the finals, the Checkers were swept in four games by the Clinton Comets.
Charlotte dropped to third place in the 1968–69 season, after many players moved up to higher leagues. The rebuilding effort was made easier by this being first season of an affiliation with the Toronto Maple Leafs. In the playoffs, Charlotte lost in three games to Nashville. The Checkers repeated a third-place finish in the 1969–70 season. Center Tom Trevelyan was named EHL Rookie of the Year for the south division. In the playoffs, Charlotte defeated the Salem Rebels in five games in the first round, then lost to Greensboro in six games in the second round. Creighton led Charlotte to its best results in the 1970–71 season, with 55 wins, and 117 points to finish first overall in the EHL, and win the Walker Cup. Goaltender John Voss led the league in goals against average, and won the George L. Davis Jr. Trophy. In the playoffs, Charlotte defeated Nashville, then Greensboro both in four games, to reach the finals. The Checkers won the Atlantic City Boardwalk Trophy in five games over the New Haven Blades.
In the 1971–72 season, Charlotte switched affiliations to the Buffalo Sabres. Defenceman Don Brennan was voted the EHL Rookie of the Year for the south division, and goaltender Gaye Cooley led the league in goals against average to win the George L. Davis Jr. Trophy. The Checkers repeated the first-place finish and the Walker Cup in the regular season, with 47 wins and 102 points. In the playoffs, Charlotte defeated the St. Petersburg Suns in six games in the first round, and Greensboro in five games in the second round. Creighton and the Checkers won a second consecutive Atlantic City Boardwalk Trophy, defeating the Syracuse Blazers in four games in the finals. Creighton and many players moved on after the two championships, and Charlotte struggled in the 1972–73 season. Jack Wells was named player-coach, and the team finished fourth place in the south, missing the playoffs.
Southern Hockey League, 1973–1977
The four teams in the EHL's Southern Division, including the Checkers, broke away to form the Southern Hockey League in 1973. In the new league, Patrick J. Kelly took over coaching duties in all four seasons. Garry Swain led the SHL in scoring with 98 points. Charlotte finished second place in the 1973–74 season, then defeated Greensboro in six games in the first round of the playoffs, but lost the finals in seven games to the Roanoke Valley Rebels.
In the 1974–75 season, Charlotte began secondary affiliations with World Hockey Association teams, and the California Golden Seals, in addition to the existing agreement with Buffalo. Steve Hull led the SHL in scoring with 114 points. The Checkers finished first place in the regular season with 101 points, defeated Roanoke in four games in the first round of the playoffs, and defeated the Hampton Gulls in six games in the finals, to win the Crockett Cup.
In the 1975–76 season, Charlotte repeated first place in the regular season with 94 points. Yvon Dupuis led the SHL with 52 goals scored. In the playoffs, Charlotte defeated Roanoke in six games in the first round, and then won a second consecutive Crockett Cup in five games over Hampton.
The 1976–77 season was cut short when the SHL folded due to financial issues. The final Checkers game was played on January 30, 1977 against the revived Baltimore Clippers. Charlotte was in third place at that time, and folded along with the league.

A quantum sensor utilizes properties of quantum mechanics, such as quantum entanglement, quantum interference, and quantum state squeezing, which have optimized precision and beat current limits in sensor technology.
The field of quantum sensing deals with the design and engineering of quantum sources (e.g., entangled) and quantum measurements that are able to beat the performance of any classical strategy in a number of technological applications. This can be done with photonic systems or solid state systems.
Characteristics
In photonics and quantum optics, photonic quantum sensing leverages entanglement, single photons and squeezed states to perform extremely precise measurements. Optical sensing makes use of continuously variable quantum systems such as different degrees of freedom of the electromagnetic field, vibrational modes of solids, and Bose–Einstein condensates. These quantum systems can be probed to characterize an unknown transformation between two quantum states. Several methods are in place to improve photonic sensors' quantum illumination of targets, which have been used to improve detection of weak signals by the use of quantum correlation.
Quantum sensors are often built on continuously variable systems, i.e., quantum systems characterized by continuous degrees of freedom such as position and momentum quadratures. The basic working mechanism typically relies on optical states of light, often involving quantum mechanical properties such as squeezing or two-mode entanglement. These states are sensitive to physical transformations that are detected by interferometric measurements.
Quantum sensing can also be utilized in non-photonic areas such as spin qubits, trapped ions, flux qubits, and nanoparticles. These systems can be compared by physical characteristics to which they respond, for example, trapped ions respond to electrical fields while spin systems will respond to magnetic fields. Trapped Ions are useful in their quantized motional levels which are strongly coupled to the electric field. They have been proposed to study electric field noise above surfaces, and more recently, rotation sensors.
In solid-state physics, a quantum sensor is a quantum device that responds to a stimulus. Usually this refers to a sensor that, which has quantized energy levels, uses quantum coherence to measure a physical quantity, or uses entanglement to improve measurements beyond what can be done with classical sensors. There are 4 criteria for solid-state quantum sensors:
The system has to have discrete, resolvable energy levels.
You can initialize the sensor and you can perform readout (turn on
and get answer).
You can coherently manipulate the sensor.
The sensor interacts with a physical quantity and has some response to that
quantity.
Research and applications
Quantum Sensors have applications in a wide variety of fields including microscopy, positioning systems, communication technology, electric and magnetic field sensors, as well as geophysical areas of research such as mineral prospecting and seismology. Many measurement devices utilize quantum properties in order to probe measurements such as atomic clocks, superconducting quantum interference devices, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. With new technological advancements, individual quantum systems can be used as measurement devices, utilizing entanglement, superposition, interference and squeezing to enhance sensitivity and surpass performance of classical strategies.
A good example of an early quantum sensor is an avalanche photodiode (APD). APDs have been used to detect entangled photons. With additional cooling and sensor improvements can be used where photomultiplier tubes (PMT) in fields such as medical imaging. APDs, in the form of 2-D and even 3-D stacked arrays, can be used as a direct replacement for conventional sensors based on silicon diodes.
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) launched a research program in optical quantum sensors that seeks to exploit ideas from quantum metrology and quantum imaging, such as quantum lithography and the NOON state, in order to achieve these goals with optical sensor systems such as lidar. The United States judges quantum sensing to be the most mature of quantum technologies for military use, theoretically replacing GPS in areas without coverage or possibly acting with ISR capabilities or detecting submarine or subterranean structures or vehicles, as well as nuclear material.
Photonic quantum sensors, microscopy and gravitational wave detectors
For photonic systems, current areas of research consider feedback and adaptive protocols. This is an active area of research in discrimination and estimation of bosonic loss.
Injecting squeezed light into interferometers allows for higher sensitivity to weak signals that would be unable to be classically detected. A practical application of quantum sensing is realized in gravitational wave sensing. Gravitational wave detectors, such as LIGO, utilize squeezed light to measure signals below the standard quantum limit. Squeezed light has also been used to detect signals below the standard quantum limit in plasmonic sensors and atomic force microscopy.
Uses of projection noise removal
Quantum sensing also has the capability to overcome resolution limits, where current issues of vanishing distinguishability between two close frequencies can be overcome by making the projection noise vanish. The diminishing projection noise has direct applications in communication protocols and nano-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.
Other uses of entanglement
Entanglement can be used to improve upon existing atomic clocks or create more sensitive magnetometers.
Quantum radars
Quantum radar is also an active area of research. Current classical radars can interrogate many target bins while quantum radars are limited to a single polarization or range. A proof-of-concept quantum radar or quantum illuminator using quantum entangled microwaves was able to detect low reflectivity objects at room-temperature – such may be useful for improved radar systems, security scanners and medical imaging systems.
Neuroimaging
In neuroimaging, the first quantum brain scanner uses magnetic imaging and could become a novel whole-brain scanning approach.
Gravity cartography of subterraneans
Quantum gravity-gradiometers that could be used to and investigate subterraneans are also in development.

Pehr Hilleström (18 November 1732 – 13 August 1816) was a Swedish artist. He served as a professor and director at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts.
Biography
Hilleström was born on the island of Väddö in the district of Roslagen, Sweden where his uncle who was the vicar. He was the eldest of twelve children. He was first trained by landscape artist Johan Philip Korn (1727–1796).
He received training at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts from artist Guillaume Taraval (1701–1750) and architect Jean Eric Rehn (1717–1793). Between 1757 and 1758, Hilleström made a study trip abroad. The journey went to Paris, Belgium and Holland. He furthered his education in the tapestry techniques and became a master tapestry weaver.
From 1759, he operated a weaving workshop in Stockholm. In 1773, Hilleström became a member of the board of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts. The academy appointed him a professor in drawing in 1794. In 1805 he received the post of Vice-Chancellor of the academy and in 1810 he succeeded Louis Masreliez (1748–1810) as Director.
Style
Hilleström painted some thirty portraits. He also performed a large number of depictions from the environments of the time.
He produced numerous genre paintings of people at their daily tasks inside upper- and middle-class homes in Stockholm. Dresses and furniture were painted exactly the way they looked and provide a valuable source of information about what life was like in those days. In addition to this, he painted craftsmen in action at mills and other early industrial workplaces. In later years, he also began to paint historic paintings and religious motives.
Personal life
In 1759 he married Ulrica Lode (1737–1779). Hilleström was the father of the artist Carl Petter Hilleström (1760-1812). His descendants included author and museum curator, Gustaf Hilleström (1911-1994).

The Laurel was the third English gold coin with a value of twenty shillings or one pound produced during the reign of King James I. It was named after the laurel that the king is portrayed as wearing on his head, but it is considerably poorer in both quality and style than the sovereign and unite which preceded it. The coin was produced during James I's third coinage (1619-1625), five different busts of the king being used in these years. All the coins were produced at the Tower Mint in London. The laurel weighed 140.5 grains (9.1 grams or just under 0.3 troy ounce), less than the previous Unite but almost exactly the same as to Unite issued under Charles I.
The earlier busts show considerably more detail of the king, who is looking to the left of the coin and has the value "XX" to the right, behind the kings' head. The legend on the obverse reads IACOBUS D G MAG BRI FRA ET HIB REX -- James by the grace of God, of Britain France and Ireland King. The reverse shows a long cross over a crowned shield which shows the arms of the four countries, and the legend FACIAM EOS IN GENTEM UNAM ("I will make them one nation", from Ezekiel 37:22)

Young Left ( ) is a socialist, Marxist, and feminist youth organisation. It is the official youth wing of the Swedish Left Party. The organisation calls themselves a "revolutionary youth organisation with roots in the communist part of the labour movement, anchored in the women's movement and influenced by the environmental- and peace movement."
Ideology
Young Left is a socialist, Marxist, and feminist political youth organisation committed to organising young people to work for social change that evolved out of the labour movement, with influences from environmentalism, the peace movement, and the feminist movement. Young Left works for social justice and a society characterised by equality, secularism, generous welfare provisions for all citizens, generous immigration policies, and respect for the environment. As its mother party, the Left Party, as well as the Social Democratic Party, Young Left is a strong supporter of the Swedish labour unions and the Swedish model, with conditions of work such as wages being regulated in branch-level collective agreements between the unions and the employers, rather than on individual basis. Ung Vänster has had various names and political alignments over the years, but is continuously characterised by the issues that have been at the centre of its history, such as antifascism, social justice, equality, and justice. During the past years, the main focus of the organisation has been the struggle against growing xenophobia in Sweden (as they mean been witnessed by the electoral success of the Sweden Democrats during the national elections of 2010) and criticism of the right government, and in particular on its privatisations of welfare services and priorities of tax reductions, rather than increased public spending on welfare and investments in infrastructure and renewable energy.
The Young Left, unlike the Left Party, are a revolutionary socialist organisation, which differentiates them from the more reformist left party in that they want to implement societal changes by revolution, and not reform.
Organisation
Young Left works together with and supports the Left Party and Vänsterns Studentförbund, but makes, on the basis of its own analyses, independent decisions regarding organisational and political issues.
History
Young Left was founded in 1903 as Socialdemokratiska Ungdomsförbundet (SDUF, Social Democratic Youth League). However, the youth league has clearly attached itself to the left-wing within the Social Democratic Party. At the outbreak of the First World War, the tensions within the party aggravated. In May 1917, the youth league together with the left-wing faction within the party took the initiative to form a new party, Sverges socialdemokratiska vänsterparti (Social Democratic Left Party of Sweden). SDUF became the youth wing of the new party. SSV joined the Communist International in 1919, and was renamed to Sveriges kommunistiska parti (Communist Party of Sweden). Following that, SDUF was renamed to Sveriges Kommunistiska Ungdomförbund (Young Communist League of Sweden), and became the Swedish section of the Communist Youth International.
In 1952, Democratic Youth was founded on the initiative of the party, in order to be a broader youth movement. Until 1958, SKU and DU existed as parallel organisations. In 1958, the two organisations merged and took the name DU.
In 1967, ultra-left elements took over the organisation, and broke away to form Marxist-leninistiska kampförbundet (Marxist–Leninist Struggle League). Reconstruction work started rapidly. In 1970, the organisation was re-baptised as Kommunistisk Ungdom (Communist Youth). By 1973, there was a national organisation in function, and, by 1975, an ordinary congress was held.
Young Left have published the youth magazine Röd Press since 1982, when Young Left lost the rights of its magazine Stormklockan to the Maoist MLK in a trial.
In Sweden, Young Left was one of the many forces behind the large 15 February 2003 anti-war protest.
Under the later years of the 2010s, different members of the Young Left have been excluded because of strong couplings to the Revolutionary Front and the AFA. The national executive board have been doing both official exclusions and cut-offs in these cases. This is because these groups are not deemed compatible with the democratic socialism and anti-racism fight that the Young Left are driving. The party board of the Left Party has also been strongly advising for hard consequences in these situations.
After having had a stable membership of between 1,500 – 2,800 for a number of years, the membership of the youth organisation had declined to 964 in 2016 according to the Swedish Agency for Youth and Civil Society.

Michael Diamond Resnick (; March 5, 1942 – January 9, 2020) was an American science fiction writer and editor. He won five Hugo awards and a Nebula award, and was the guest of honor at Chicon 7. He was the executive editor of the defunct magazine Jim Baen's Universe, and the creator and editor of Galaxy's Edge magazine.
Biography
Resnick was born in Chicago on March 5, 1942. He was a 1959 graduate of Highland Park High School in Highland Park, Illinois. He sold his first piece of writing in 1957, while still in high school. He attended the University of Chicago from 1959 to 1961 and met his future wife, Carol L. Cain, there. The couple began dating in mid-December 1960 and were engaged by the end of the month. They were married in 1961.
In the 1960s and early 1970s, Resnick wrote over 200 erotic adult novels under various pseudonyms and edited three men's magazines and seven tabloid newspapers. For over a decade he wrote a weekly column about horse racing and a monthly column about purebred collies, which he and his wife bred and showed. His wife was an uncredited collaborator on much of his science fiction and a co-author on two movie scripts they sold, based on his novels Santiago and The Widowmaker. His daughter Laura Resnick is a science fiction and fantasy author.
Resnick lived in Cincinnati from 1976 until his death following a battle with cancer on January 9, 2020.
Work and themes
Two notable motifs are evident in much of Resnick's science fiction work—his love of fable and legend. The other main subject of his work is Africa, especially Kenya's Kikuyu people, their history, traditions and culture and colonialism and its aftermath. He visited Kenya often and drew on his experiences there. Some of his science fiction stories are allegories of Kenyan history and politics; other stories are actually set in Africa or have African characters.
Resnick's style is known for its humor. He enjoyed collaborating with other writers, especially on short stories. Through 2014 he had collaborated with 52 different writers on short fiction, three on screenplays, and three on novels. Late in life, he began writing and selling a series of mystery novels as well, featuring detective Eli Paxton. He had also sold screenplays based on his novels to Miramax, Capella, and Jupiter 9, and often had multiple properties under option to Hollywood studios.
His work has been translated into: French, Italian, German, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Hebrew, Russian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Czech, Dutch, Latin, Swedish, Romanian, Finnish, Portuguese, Slovakian, Chinese, Catalan, Danish, Croatian, and Greek. Resnick's papers are in the Special Collections Library of the University of South Florida in Tampa.
Editing
Resnick worked as an editor for National Insider from 1966 to 1969, and also as editor-in-chief of National Features Syndicate from 1967 to 1968. He was a publisher and editor for Oligarch Press from 1969 onwards. From 1988 on Resnick edited over 40 fiction anthologies. He was an editorial consultant for BenBella Books from 2004 to 2006 and executive editor of Jim Baen's Universe from 2007 through 2010. From 2011 he was the series' editor for The Stellar Guild series published by Phoenix Pick. The series pairs lesser-known science fiction and fantasy authors with best-selling veterans of the genre. Beginning in 2013, he was the editor of the bi-monthly magazine Galaxy's Edge, published by Arc Manor, which reprints work by major names in the field along with new stories by new and lesser-known writers.
Fandom
Resnick and his wife were participants in science fiction fandom from 1962. As of 2012 Resnick had been the guest of honor at some 42 science fiction conventions and toastmaster at a dozen others. Resnick's wife created costumes in which she and Resnick appeared at five Worldcon masquerades in the 1970s, winning four out of five contests.

In Māori and Polynesian mythology, Ikatere, also spelled Ika-tere, ('fast fish') is a fish god, the father of all sea creatures, including mermaids.
He is a son of Punga, and a grandson of Tangaroa, and his brother is Tū-te-wehiwehi (Grey 1971:1–5).
Disagreements between brothers
When Tāwhirimātea (god of storms) made war against his brothers for the separation of Rangi and Papa (sky and earth), Ikatere and Tū-te-wehiwehi were among those who had to flee from his wrath for their survival. The two argued over whether they should stay in the sea or go to the land. Ikatere chose to keep his children, the fish, to the sea, while Tū-te-wehiwehi chose to take his children, reptiles, to the land. A saying that refers to the choices they made for their descendants goes as such:

The global headquarters for Novus International is located in St. Louis, Missouri in the US and is Platinum LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified, which is a designation that is offered by the United States Green Building Council and is available to buildings that demonstrate energy efficiency and sustainability. Prior to the new construction, Novus had two facilities in St. Louis, located 12 miles (19 km) apart; one was the administration building and the other was the research lab.
When being considered for certification, the Council uses several criteria in determining eligibility, which include: energy savings, water efficiency, emissions reduction, improved indoor environmental quality, and stewardship of resources and sensitivity to their impacts. In order to achieve Platinum LEED certification, a building must score between 52 and 69 points. Novus' project totals, according to pre-certification estimates, were 69 points.
Features of the Novus International global headquarters facility which contribute to the achievement of Platinum LEED certification include:
Electricity
The second largest array of solar panels in Missouri (5,000 square feet).
Three percent of the building's electricity comes from the 35-kilowatt photovoltaic panels. They provide 44,835 kilowatt hours of energy annually.
Exchanged all of the outdated, inefficient fluorescent light fixtures with new, more efficient models.
Fitted with floor-to-ceiling windows and skylights in order to take advantage of the natural day lighting.
Certificates have been purchased for 100% electricity from renewable wind sources on the Blue Grass Wind Farm in northwest Missouri and a wind farm in Texas.
Recycling
98% of the original building was reused, including walls, doors, and flooring.
98.4% percent of the on-site construction waste was diverted from landfills and recycled.
Masonry was sent to an aggregate recycler. When it returned, it was reused on the site as fill under the parking lots.
Drywall waste was ground up and used as soft material in the sculpted landscaping soil surfaces.
Metal was sent to a metals recycler and wood went to a composter in St. Louis.
Cardboard, plastics, and paper all were recycled in traditional methods.
All of the old lighting fixtures, including the lamps and the ballasts, were sent to recyclers.
One paper recycling container is available at every work station, and in copy rooms, lab offices, and the mail room.
Glass, metal, and plastic recycling containers are located at coffee stations adjacent to men's and women's changing rooms.
Cardboard recycling stations are located by the loading dock and in the mail room.
10% of the total materials cost came from salvaged materials. Novus purchased a large shipment of salvaged raised flooring from an old computer center.
31% of the total materials cost came from recycled content. Examples include countertops made from recycled milk jugs and scrap aluminum, fitness room floor made from recycled tires, and carpet containing recycled yarn.
Landscaping
The landscaping was designed to restore 53.4% of the area to its original, natural Missouri habitat.
Landscape using Missouri native grasses and plants such as grasses, sedums, and low ground cover designed to require no irrigation, equating to thousands of gallons of water saved each year.
A storm water system that will greatly reduce the environmental impact of runoff and improve water quality to receiving streams and eventually the Missouri River. More specifically, the addition of vegetated bioswales that divert stormwater from the municipal wastewater system.
Other
The HVAC was installed as an under-floor air distribution system that is extremely efficient with controls at individual workstations.
In the restrooms, exchanging all the older 3.5-gallon (13.2-L) toilets with dual-flush 1.6-gallon (6.1-L) tanks reduced the quantity of sanitary wastewater by 50 percent. In addition, urinals and lavatories were replaced with low-flow fixtures.
Preferred parking for numerous employees who drive low-emitting or fuel efficient vehicles that have scored above a 40 on the scoring system on the greenercars.org website.<ref>
Materials used
3Form 100 percent – Surface material made from recycled milk jugs and is used on countertops in the reception area.
Alkemi – Surface material made from recycled scrap aluminum and is used on a desk in the reception area.
IceStone – Surface material containing recycled glass is used in the reception area and the coffee bar.
PaperStone – surface material made from recycled paper and used for countertops at the coffee bar.
Bamboo – The Fastest growing hardwood in the world and is used on many of the wood surfaces in the building including doors and cabinets.
Wheat board – Engineered from straw fibers and was used instead of plywood.
Linoleum – Plant based material made from linseed oil and pine resin and used in flooring.
Cumaru – The Forest Stewardship Council standards ensure that this wood is harvested in a responsible fashion. The FSC-certified Brazilian hardwood is used in the reception area and accounted for 66.76% of new wood-based costs.

Steve Kaufmann (born 8 October 1945) is a Swedish-born Canadian polyglot. As of , he has an understanding of 20 languages, to varying degrees.
Background
Kaufmann was born in Sweden in 1945 to Jewish parents from the town of Prostějov in Czechoslovakia, now in the Czech Republic. His parents were bilingual in both Czech and German. At the age of five, in 1951, the family moved to Montreal, Canada, where he grew up. In June 1962, Kaufmann quit his construction job and looked to find a ship in the docks he could work on in exchange for taking him to Europe. On his third attempt at asking, he was given a job aboard the German tramp steamer, the Gerda Schell, which had lost a sailor in Quebec City. He arrived in London ten days later. After a week there he caught a ferry at Dover and landed in Ostend, Belgium, before heading to France. After a year living in Grenoble, he continued studying politics at the L'Institut d'Études Politiques (Institute of Political Studies, commonly known as Sciences Po) and learning French in Paris.
Kaufmann hitchhiked through Europe after his studies, picking up basic language skills in Spain, Italy and Germany. He went on to join the Canadian diplomatic service, where he began learning Mandarin in Hong Kong in 1969, and became fluent in it within a year of full-time studying. When re-posted to the Canadian embassy in Japan in the early 1970s, he had to learn Japanese.
Moving from his role as a trade commissioner, he then used his language ability in commercial trade, living in Japan for 9 years. Eventually, mainly later in life, he started learning more languages.
Current work
Kaufmann appears at conferences to speak on his language learning techniques and abilities. He also runs a number of social media channels discussing his experiences of language learning and suggested techniques, both of which focus on language learning techniques and assisting people who are learning language.
He was one of the founding organisers of the North American Polyglot symposium. Kaufmann travels to learn languages, and has given numerous interviews in native languages on various television channels around the world, in languages such as Chinese, Russian and Ukrainian. He has been a regular contributor to the Huffington Post.
Language learning
Kaufmann has spent over 50 years studying languages. He advocates total immersion in the learning process. He places great emphasis on absorbing the language by reading texts and by not worrying too much about unfamiliar words, believing that they will gradually be acquired through repeated reading. Though he supports using techniques such as flashcards for memorizing difficult words, most of his learning time goes into listening to native speakers and reading texts. He is particularly fond of reading books on the history of the country or region of the language he is learning in the native language. Kaufmann prefers not to have a fixed daily schedule when learning a language. He enjoys listening to content in his target languages while performing other tasks. He states that age is not necessarily an impediment to learning a language, and that it is possible for older people to learn languages as well as younger people. He also recognizes mistakes as a natural part of the learning process, and believes that people can still be considered fluent even while making some mistakes.
Kaufmann started to learn Russian, his 9th language, when he was 60. As of , he has an understanding of 20 languages, though his ability to speak and write in them to a highly proficient level varies considerably. He has stated that he rarely writes in the languages, and that revisiting acquired languages he is out of practice in can be challenging initially when interacting with a native speaker. The languages he speaks aside from English are: French, Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Swedish, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Ukrainian, Czech, Slovak, and Romanian. He also learned some Greek and Turkish and is currently learning Arabic and Persian. As of , he stated that after studying Turkish he will focus on learning Arabic and Persian, and spends time listening to Arabic TV series and Al Jazeera news, and reading books on Arabic and Persian history.
The prominent scholar of language acquisition Stephen Krashen has studied Kaufmann's approach to language learning as well as that of other polyglots such as Kató Lomb. Krashen claims the success of Kaufmann and other polyglots as independent support for his own ideas on second language learning, and sees Kaufmann's approach as a model for other language learners. He has praised Kaufmann as "really good, no question" and has said that "he has been my language therapist, helping me."

Rockne Lee Brubaker, II (born June 21, 1986) is an American former competitive pair skater. With Keauna McLaughlin, he is the 2010 Four Continents silver medalist, the 2007 World Junior champion, and a two-time (2008–2009) U.S. national champion. With Mary Beth Marley, he is the 2012 Four Continents bronze medalist and 2012 U.S. silver medalist.
Personal life
Rockne Brubaker Jr was born in St. Louis, Missouri. His younger brother Collin Brubaker is a competitive ice dancer. He was named after his father, Rockne Brubaker Sr., who had been named after Knute Rockne.
Brubaker graduated from Harry D. Jacobs High School in Algonquin, Illinois. He is a student at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs majoring in business administration and sports marketing.
Brubaker became engaged to Italian pair skater Stefania Berton on February 2, 2013. The couple married on June 5, 2015, in Wisconsin.
Career
Early years
Rockne Brubaker began skating at the age of five or six. He originally competed as a single skater, reaching the level of novice. He competed as a pair skater at the same time and eventually gave up singles to focus on pairs around age 12. At 17, he left Chicago and moved to Colorado Springs to train with top pairs coach Dalilah Sappenfield.
With partner Stephanie Freitag, he placed 5th at the novice level at the 2001–2002 season Midwestern Sectional Championships.
In September 2003, Brubaker began skating with Mariel Miller, with whom he competed on the junior level. They won bronze medals at the 2004–05 ISU Junior Grand Prix Final and the 2005–06 ISU Junior Grand Prix Final. They won the junior title at the 2005 U.S. Championships. While originally intending to compete at the senior level at the 2006 U.S. Championships, Miller & Brubaker announced their split in December 2005 due to a lack of height difference that could lead to injury. They were coached by Dalilah Sappenfield and Tom Zakrajsek.
Partnership with McLaughlin
Sappenfield teamed up Brubaker with Keauna McLaughlin in May 2006. They were coached by Sappenfield and Lei Ina McLaughlin in Colorado Springs. The pair went undefeated in their first competitive season together (2006–07). In that season, McLaughlin and Brubaker competed on the 2006–07 ISU Junior Grand Prix circuit and won both their events and the Junior Grand Prix Final. They went on to win the junior title at both the 2007 U.S. Championships and the 2007 World Junior Championships. McLaughlin and Brubaker were the fourth American pair team in history to win the World Junior title. Because of the age difference between McLaughlin and Brubaker, this was their only junior-age-eligible season.
McLaughlin and Brubaker began the 2007–2008 season on the Grand Prix circuit at the 2007 Cup of China, where they won the silver medal. They won a second silver medal at the 2007 NHK Trophy. Their success at these two competitions qualified them for the 2007–08 Grand Prix Final, but they withdrew after the short program due to an injury to Brubaker.
Later that season, they competed at the 2008 U.S. Championships and won the senior national title, becoming the first U.S. pairs team in 51 years to win consecutive junior and senior national titles. Despite winning the U.S. title, McLaughlin and Brubaker were not assigned to the World Championship or World Junior Championship team due to ISU age restrictions. McLaughlin was too young for senior ISU championships and Brubaker was too old for the World Junior Championships. McLaughlin and Brubaker's win, combined with the wins of Jessica Rose Paetsch & Jon Nuss on the junior level, and Brynn Carman & Christopher Knierim on the novice level, gave their coach Dalilah Sappenfield a sweep of national pair champions for 2008, an accomplishment which led to Sappenfield being named Coach of the Year.
McLaughlin and Brubaker began the 2008–2009 season at the 2008 Skate America, where they won the silver medal. A week later they competed at the 2008 Skate Canada International, where they won the bronze medal. At the 2009 U.S. Championships, McLaughlin and Brubaker successfully defended their national title, which resulted in them being selected to compete at the 2009 Four Continents and the 2009 Worlds. They placed 5th at Four Continents and 11th at the World Championships.
In April 2009, Brubaker had hernia surgery to repair muscle tears in his lower abdomen.
In May 2009, McLaughlin and Brubaker changed coaches to John Nicks and relocated to California.
McLaughlin and Brubaker began the 2009–2010 season at the 2009 Cup of Russia, where they won the bronze medal. They continued their season at the 2009 Skate America, where they placed 4th. As the top American pair team on the international circuit, McLaughlin and Brubaker entered the 2010 U.S. Championships as the favorites to win their third consecutive national title and secure one of the two pair skating berths on the U.S. Olympic team. Despite several days of strong practices, they delivered an uncharacteristically rough short program, including falls on a triple salchow and a freak fall on a death spiral, leaving them in 7th place. The pair was able to move up to 5th place after the long program but it was not enough to win a place on the Olympic team.
Determined to rebound from their national result, McLaughlin and Brubaker competed at the 2010 Four Continents less than ten days later. There, they recorded a personal best score in the short program and ultimately won the silver medal.
In June 2010, McLaughlin and Brubaker announced the end of their partnership.
Partnership with Marley
Brubaker was uncertain whether to continue skating competitively but his coach arranged some tryouts. In August, he had a two-day tryout with Mary Beth Marley and he was impressed enough to cancel his other tryouts, although she had no pairs experience. Marley relocated to Aliso Viejo, California, and they began training together in earnest in September with coach John Nicks. Their first international competition was the Toruń Cup in Toruń, Poland, where they earned the minimum technical scores required to compete at an ISU Championship. They placed fourth at the 2011 U.S. Nationals and were named as alternates for Four Continents. They were assigned to the event after an injury led Caydee Denney and Jeremy Barrett to withdraw. Jenni Meno and Todd Sand became their main coaches for the 2011–12 season and Nicks also continued to work with the pair.
In the 2012–13 season, Marley and Brubaker were assigned to 2012 Skate Canada International and 2012 NHK Trophy, however, on August 14, 2012, the pair announced the end of their partnership. Brubaker said he planned to continue in competitive figure skating. In late August, he had a tryout with Amanda Evora, which did not result in a partnership because neither of them could move. Brubaker said he would not compete in the 2012–2013 season. In January 2013, he confirmed he had moved back to Chicago and was continuing his partner search.
Later career
On February 19, 2013, Brubaker announced his partnership with Lindsay Davis. They competed together for one season. In March 2014, he became the skating director at the Fox Valley Ice Arena in Illinois.

Lt.-General Sir William Warre (15 April 1784 – 26 July 1853) was an English officer of the British Army. He saw service in the Peninsular War and was colonel of the 94th Foot.
Early life and education
Warre was born in Porto, Portugal, the eldest son of wine merchant James Warre, a partner in Warre & Co., and his wife, Eleanor Greg, daughter of Thomas Greg of Belfast. The Warres had been settled in Porto for generations as exporters of the region's famed Port wine. The company is still operating as Warre's, and Sir William's portrait hangs in the city's famed Factory House.
He was educated at Harrow School, but apparently left early to return to Portugal and join the family business. The boy was placed in the office of his uncle, also named William Warre, to learn the trade. However, a mischievous prank, in which he used sealing wax to affix the ponytail of the Portuguese member of the firm to his desk, ended his career as a merchant. He was sent to Bonn to study with a private tutor.
His nephew Edmond Warre, who later published a collection of his letters, Letters from the Peninsula, 1808–1812, shared a story in the preface about his uncle's adventures in Bonn. He and another student decided to join the Austrians in their war against France and were promptly taken prisoner. They were brought before a French general who realised they were mere boys and English to boot. The French General told them they were lucky they were not brought before "The Iron Marshal" Louis-Nicolas Davout, "for he would have hanged you without mercy on the nearest tree. Now go back to your books and your tutor and don't meddle with affairs which do not concern you." Edmond places the story shortly before 1803 but identifies the French general as General Custine, who was briefly the commander of the Army of the North (28 May – 16 July 1793) before he was executed by guillotine, when William was not yet 10 years old.
Career
On 5 November 1803, Warre was commissioned as an ensign in the 52nd Foot. He purchased a promotion to lieutenant on 2 June 1804, followed by a commission on 25 April 1806 in the 98th Foot. Four months later he exchanged into the 23rd Light Dragoons.
Warre attended Royal Military College, Sandhurst in the summer of 1807 and the following May was appointed aide-de-camp to Major-General Sir Ronald Craufurd Ferguson. A few months later, Warre returned to his native Portugal where he saw action at the battles of Roliça (17 August) and Vimeiro (21 August) before falling ill with dysentery. He was sent to recover in Lisbon, where Major-General William Carr Beresford welcomed him into his house. After his recovery, Beresford installed Warre in his staff and he served throughout Sir John Moore's campaign, ending with the Battle of Coruña in January 1809.
When Beresford was appointed Commander in Chief of the Portuguese Army in March 1809, Warre was appointed his first aide-de-camp and promoted to Major. Warre took part in all the operations of Beresford's division in 1809–10, including the Crossing of the Douro and the capture of Porto as Arthur Wellesley.
However, he fell ill with rheumatic fever during the retreat to the lines of Torres Vedras in September 1810, forcing him to return to England to recuperate. He rejoined Beresford in May 1811 after the Battle of Albuera, and took part in the Second Siege of Badajoz in May and June.
He was promoted to be brevet major in the British Army in 1811, and lieutenant-colonel in the Anglo-Portuguese Army on 3 July. He was at the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812, at the third siege and capture of Badajoz in April, and at the battle of Salamanca on 22 July, where Beresford was wounded.
Warre served as deputy quartermaster-general at the Cape of Good Hope from 1813–21. In 1823, he was appointed a permanent assistant quartermasters-general, and served in Dublin until 1826, when he was transferred to Portsmouth. In December 1826, he was appointed assistant quartermaster-general under Lieutenant-General Sir William Henry Clinton. He was sent back to Portugal, where he stayed until 1828, to support the Portuguese against Spain in the War of the Two Brothers.
Warre was promoted to colonel in 1830. Two years later, he was transferred from Portsmouth to Cork as permanent assistant quartermaster-general, and in 1835 returned to Dublin. He served as commandant of the garrison at Chatham, Kent from 1837–41, after which he promoted to major-general. In 1847, he appointed colonel of the 94th Foot and promoted again to lieutenant-general in November 1851.
Honours
For Warre's service in the Peninsular War, he received the medal and six clasps from the British Army. For his many years of service in Portugal in the Peninsular War and War of the Two Brothers, he was knighted in the Order of the Tower and Sword by Queen Maria II of Portugal. He was also a Commander of the Order of Aviz by the Portuguese.
He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1838 Coronation Honours of Queen Victoria, and was knighted the following year.
Personal life
On 19 November 1812, he married Selina Anna Maling, the youngest daughter of Christopher Thompson Maling. They had two daughters and four sons:
William James Warre (October 1813 – 11 January 1815), died in childhood
Capt. Thomas Maling Warre (20 October 1814 – 15 September 1851) of the East India Company
Lieut. John Frederick Warre (27 November 1815 – 3 July 1847) of the Royal Navy, died while serving in China
Selina Eleanor Warre (January – 3 September 1817), died in childhood
Sir Henry James Warre (1819–1898)
Julia Sophia Warre (1820–1873), died unmarried
His wife's elder sister Sophia married Henry Phipps, 1st Earl of Mulgrave, and was the mother of Constantine Phipps, 1st Marquess of Normanby.
He died in York in 1853 and was buried at Bishopthorpe.

Virginia Estelle Randolph (May 1870 – March 16, 1958) was an American educator in Henrico County, Virginia. She was named the United States' first "Jeanes Supervising Industrial Teacher" by her Superintendent of Schools, Jackson Davis, and she led a program funded by the Jeanes Foundation to upgrade vocational training throughout the U.S. South as her career progressed. Her work is widely associated with vocational education. Two schools of the Henrico County Public Schools system were named in her honor and in 2009 Randolph was posthumously honored by the Library of Virginia as one of their "Virginia Women in History" for her career and contributions to education.
Early life and education
Born in May 1870, she was the daughter of former slaves Sarah Elizabeth Carter Randolph and Edward Nelson Randolph. Her mother was a domestic worker from Campbell County and her father was a bricklayer. Virginia had three sisters: Mary, Sarah, and Emma, the latter of whom was one month old when her father died in 1874. Her mother remarried twice. Her second husband was Joseph Anderson, a carpenter. She then married a laborer, Joseph Minor. The family attended the Moore Street Missionary Baptist Church, which operated the Moore Street Industrial School. The school taught black children academic and manual arts, like printmaking, carpentry, and sewing. Randolph was a member of the church throughout her life. She was taught handiwork by her mother.
Raised during the Reconstruction era following the American Civil War (1861–1865), Randolph was educated in schools in Richmond, Virginia. The state formed a public school system in 1870. She attended Baker School, the first public school built for black students in Richmond. Her second school, Richmond Colored Normal School (now Armstrong High School), was founded by the Freedmen's Bureau in 1867. A "noted secondary school", its curriculum included botany, civil government, physical geography, map drawing, and physiology. It also prepared interested students to be teachers. She was a teacher at the age of 16.
Career in public education
Randolph began her career as a school teacher. After a short teaching experience in Goochland County, she taught in Hanover County in 1893. She secured a teaching position with the Henrico County School Board the next year. She opened a one-room schoolhouse, the Mountain Road School. She fixed up the dilapidated building and traveled throughout the county to recruit students. As a teacher there, Randolph taught her students woodworking, sewing, and gardening, as well as academics. She believed that manual arts helped students had opportunities for employment if they were unable to acquire secondary education. She involved members of the community members—while also instilling pride and pro-activity—she established school improvement leagues and the Willing Worker Clubs. Beyond the importance of academics and learning skills, Randolph also thought it was important to promote healthy spirits and hearts. Towards that end, she established Sunday afternoon classes at the school, with the assistance of Virginia Union University faculty and students and her minister, Reverend R. O. Johnson. Her programs were financially supported by Bryan and Steward families and were promoted by Henrico County Schools's supervisor Jackson Davis.
In 1908, Davis named her to become the United States' first "Jeanes Supervising Industrial Teacher." Anna T. Jeanes, a wealthy Philadelphia Quaker, had set aside $1 million to establish a fund to maintain and assist rural schools for African Americans in the South. Among its projects, the Jeanes Foundation provided funds to employ black "supervisors" dedicated to upgrading vocational training programs for black students. Jeanes supervisors sought to improve schools throughout communities until 1968.
As the overseer of twenty-three elementary schools in Henrico County, Randolph developed the first in-service training program for black teachers and worked on improving the curriculum of the schools. With the freedom to design her own agenda, she shaped industrial work and community self-help programs to meet specific needs of schools. She chronicled her progress by becoming the author of the Henrico Plan which became a reference book for southern schools receiving assistance from the Jeanes Foundation, which became known as the Negro Rural School Fund. Randolph's teaching techniques and philosophy were later adopted in Great Britain's African colonies.
On March 30, 1908, following a proclamation by Virginia Governor Claude A. Swanson, Randolph founded the first Arbor Day Program in Virginia. She and her students planted twelve sycamore trees. Some of the trees remain standing as living monuments, but over the years, some of the trees were lost to disease. In 1976, the remaining ones were named the first notable trees in Virginia by the National Park Service.
In 1915, Randolph opened the Virginia Randolph Training School and later expanded the facility to include dormitories for future teachers. It was later renamed to Virginia Randolph Education Center. Randolph was appointed to the Industrial School Board of Colored Children after the death of another noted Richmonder, Maggie L. Walker. She also served for many years on the Inter-Racial and Health Board for the Commonwealth of Virginia.
After a 57-year career with Henrico County Public Schools, Randolph retired in 1949. A foundation to honor her and award scholarships was formed in 1954.
Personal life
Randolph, who remained single throughout her life, took in children whose parents were unable to care for them to board at her house. She adopted Carrie B. Sample, one of fifty children that she took in and raised. She died in Richmond on March 16, 1958, at the age of 84.
Legacy
The Virginia Randolph Fund was founded in 1936 as a tribute to her. The Southern Education Foundation, a not-for-profit foundation, was created in 1937 from four funds intended to support education for blacks: the Peabody Education Fund, the John F. Slater Fund, the Negro Rural School Fund, and the Virginia Randolph Fund.
The Virginia Randolph Home Economics Cottage was made into a museum in memory of Randolph in 1970. The Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission designated the museum a State Historic Landmark. In 1976 the museum was named a National Historic Landmark by the United States Department of Interior, National Park Service. Randolph reportedly had an office in the building. Her gravesite is on the grounds.
The Academy at Virginia Randolph, formerly Virginia Randolph Community High School, in Glen Allen, Virginia is named in her honor.
The Virginia Randolph Foundation, Inc formed in 1954, annually awards scholarships to Henrico County high school students who will be attending a four-year college or university.

Successors to Ikarus are all those companies, created after 2003 and sooner or later started producing vehicles under the brand of the original company.
Prelude
Ikarus was a bus manufacturer based in Budapest and Székesfehérvár, Hungary, established in 1895. Ikarus later became a prominent factory in Hungary and was able to dominate most of the Eastern Bloc countries' markets. In 2003, due to numerous financial struggles and a change in ownership, the company was shut down. Ikarus was outlived by one of its subsidiaries called Ikarus EAG, but it was also shut down in 2007 by the then parent company Irisbus.
The last chairman of the main company Ikarus, was called Gábor Széles. Under his leadership, Ikarus was sold to Irisbus. Széles, a successful businessman and close partner of the Hungarian government increased his wealth while the company slid towards bankruptcy. In 1998, Széles bought some of the shares from the Hungarian state and in return promised to provide work for the companies' employment for the next ten years or otherwise he'll have to pay back hundreds of millions of forints to the state.
Since 2003, Széles has constantly tried reviving the Hungarian bus manufacturing, without any major success.
Hungarian Bus Kft.
After only two months since the shut down of Ikarus in 2003, Széles established a new company called Hungarian Bus Kft. and promised to start producing new vehicles. Yet the production did not start until 2007. In this company 50% share belonged to Széles' other company called Műszertechnika Holding Rt. The latter managed to buy back the factory in Székesfehérvár and the rights to produce buses from Irisbus, but not the brand.
The "new" vehicle was heavily based on the Ikarus C56 model, which was basically an Ikarus 256 and therefore 30 years old construction with modern design. The model was called IK HB 122L, in which "IK" refers to "Ikarus". It was Széles' way to bypass the agreement with Irisbus. After all, Hungarian Bus only managed to build five units and in 2007 it already ceased to exist. Széles has been widely criticized for only creating the company to avoid paying back an enormous amount of money to the state as compensation for his unfulfilled promise.
Magyar Autóbuszgyártó Kft.
Auto Rad Controlle Kft.
The Auto Rad Controlle Kft. or ARC, was originally established in 1989 and was serving as one of the many suppliers of Ikarus. Later on, they started to repair autobuses and in 2005 they developed and produced their first vehicle the ARC 187, an 18,75 metres long 5-doored, articulated bus. The company soon released two other models, the ARC 127 and 134, as well.
Széles and his proposal
In 2010, Széles, who by this time managed to license the Ikarus brand from Irisbus, proposed a deal to ARC, which consisted of the following: the Műszertechnika Holding Rt. and Auto Rad Controlle creates a new company called Magyar Autóbuszgyártó Kft. (eng.: Hungarian Autobus Manufacturer Ltd.). The former gives the Ikarus name for the vehicles and provides orders from Hungarian and Russian customers, while the latter builds the units.
The "new" models were produced without any modification, but the changing of ARC logo to Ikarus. However, they did receive new modell names on the following patern: ARC 187 became Ikarus V187, where V stands for Városi (eng.: City). Still in 2010 a trolleybus prototype, called ARC-SZKT Tr187, was created from an earlier agreement disclosed by ARC. This vehicle was co-constructed by the Szegedi Közlekedési Társaság and was essentially the articulated trolleybus version of the Ikarus V187. Later a total number of 13 vehicles were delivered to the SZKT. These units were the first facelifted units of the Ikarus-ARC cooperation. The model also received a new name: Ikarus-Škoda Tr187.2, as the electrical systems were provided by the Czech manufacturer. The new design, which was later adopted by the autobuses as well, was created by János Tóth, a former designer of the NABI.
In 2013, a series of 18 units of the Ikarus V127 V2 model was ordered by BKV Zrt. in PKD construction, meaning that ARC-Ikarus only produced the major parts of these vehicles, while the operating company had to finish them. Later 50 more units were ordered by BKV in 2014.
Departure from Széles
In 2014, Auto Rad Controlle decided to break the agreement with Gábor Széles, because he failed to provide them with the promised orders and the company came close to closing down.
MABI-Bus Kft.
Lanta Consulting Kft.
The Lanta is a small company, which's main area of expertise and works are restoring older Ikarus modells. This manufacturer managed to buy back the rights to build the modells of Ikarus EAG and to use the brand from Irisbus.
Evopro Holding Zrt.
Evopro is in the hands of Csaba Mészáros and was producing a variety of products, including small, Electric buses with composit, modular build, under the model name Modulo Medio Electric 20 of these vehicles were sold, after renaming the modell to Modulo C68e, to the BKV in 2014, but they proved to be severely unreliable by 2016. After 75% of them were constantly incapable of leaving the garage and 100% were useless during winter time, BKV even decided to dispose one of them in 2018.
MABI-Bus Kft.
In 2015, the Evopro Holding bought the earlier closed down Hungarian plant of NABI and then with Auto Rad Controlle and Lanta Consulting established a new company called MABI-Bus Kft. At this point, the new company could have produced:
E-series Ikarus buses, since Lanta had the rights of Ikarus EAG.
NABI Sirius buses, because Evopro had the rights for these.
the Ikarus V187/V127 models without the Ikarus brand, because Széles only provided the brand name, while the vehicles were developed by ARC.
However MABI decided not to use the Ikarus brand on its vehicles, yet later the company was renamed to Ikarus Egyedi Kft. Ever since there is a constant litigation between Mészáros' Ikarus Egyedi and Széles' Műszertechnika Holding which still licenses the original parent company's Ikarus name.
In 2016, more than 50% of the company's shares were bought by the Austrian VIECAP Gmbh.
In 2018, after failing to produce 180 units of the Modulo M168d model (the successors of Ikarus V187), the company got dangerously close to bankruptcy. The limited number of vehicles that were delivered to BKV on the other hand, were all suffering from serious design flaws and differed from the construction that was ordered. These proved to be incapable to serve in traffic.
On the 9th of July, Csaba Mészáros, chairman of the Ikarus Egyedi Kft. asked for bankruptcy protection from the government, as the company became insolvent and production was ceased.
Ikarus Global Zrt.
In 2017, Széles started to promote his new company, called Ikarus Global Zrt., which was to produce new, LNG heavily based on Ikarus V127 model. Even though the rights to produce those vehicles remain with Auto Rad Controlle. However, no such or any vehicle was produced by the company as of June 2018.

Succimer, sold under the brand name Chemet among others, is a medication used to treat lead, mercury, and arsenic poisoning. When radiolabeled with technetium-99m, it is used in a number of types of diagnostic testing. A full course is 19 days of medications by mouth. More than two weeks should pass before a second course is given.
Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and low blood neutrophil levels. Liver problems and allergic reactions may also occur with use. Whether use during pregnancy is safe for the baby is unclear. Dimercaptosuccinic acid is in the chelating agent family of medications. It works by binding with lead and a number of other heavy metals, allowing them to leave the body in the urine.
Dimercaptosuccinic acid has been used medically since the 1950s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In the United States, no generic version was available as of 2015.
Medical uses
Dimercaptosuccinic acid is indicated for the treatment of lead poisoning in children with blood level measured above 45 µg/dl. The use of dimercaptosuccinic acid is not approved for prevention of lead poisoning in anticipation of exposure in known lead-contaminated environments. Dimercaptosuccinic acid can cross the blood–brain barrier of mice, but it is not known if this is also the case in humans. Even if dimercaptosuccinic acid cannot reverse the damages done to the central nervous system, it might prevent further deterioration.
Dimercaptosuccinic acid facilitates urinary excretion of lead, and with sufficiently aggressive treatment, can reduce lead content in the brain. It also increases urinary excretion of copper and zinc. Dimercaptosuccinic acid improved cognitive function in rats that had been exposed to lead, but reduced cognitive function in rats that had not been exposed to lead.
Chemistry
It is the organosulfur compound with the formula HO2CCH(SH)CH(SH)CO2H. This colorless solid contains two carboxylic acid and two thiol groups, the latter being responsible for its mildly unpleasant odour. It occurs in two diastereomers, meso and the chiral dl forms.
The 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid molecule has two stereocentres (two asymmetric carbon atoms), and can exist as three different stereoisomers. The 2S,3S and 2R,3R isomers are a pair of enantiomers, whereas the 2R,3S isomer is a meso compound and thus optically inactive.
Preparation and reactivity
Dimercaptosuccinic acid may be prepared by reacting acetylenedicarboxylic acid with sodium thiosulfate or thioacetic acid followed by hydrolysis. The dimethyl ester is also known.
Meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid binds to "soft" heavy metals such as Hg2+ and Pb2+, mobilizing these ions for excretion. It binds to metal cations through the thiol groups, which ionize upon complexation.
History
Dimercaptosuccinic acid was first synthesized by V. Nirenburg in the Urals Polytechnic Institute, commissioned by one of the electrical enterprises of Sverdlovsk, which consumed many tons of mercury and was looking for a medicine to prevent poisoning of personnel. In 1957, Chinese scientists found that dimercaptosuccinic acid can effectively treat antimony poisoning due to overdose of tartar emetic. Pronounced protective effect in animal poisoning with arsenic and mercury was first shown by I. Okonishnikova in 1962. In 1984, the now-defunct Bock Pharmaceutical Company requested the FDA grant approval for orphan drug status under the brand name Chemet and the FDA approved of this in 1991, providing exclusivity until 1998 which was conveyed to the successor Sanofi in 1996.

The Chemehuevi Mountains are found at the southeast border of San Bernardino County in southeastern California adjacent the Colorado River. Located south of Needles, California and northwest of the Whipple Mountains, the mountains lie in a north-south direction in general, and are approximately 15 miles in length.
Geography
The mountains are located between U.S. Route 95 and the Topock Gorge of the River, just south of Interstate 40. Whale Mountain, at , is found at the northern end of the range about five miles east of Lobecks Pass. The Chemehuevi range reaches at its highpoint, Chemehuevi Peak, located at the range's extreme southwest, bordering Chemehuevi Valley and Wash, where the valley turns due-east to meet the Colorado River.
Chemehuevi Mountains Wilderness
The Chemehuevi Mountains Wilderness Area encompasses the rugged, granitic Chemehuevi Mountains. The mountain range is horseshoe-shaped, with the open end facing eastward toward the Colorado River. Contained within the arms of the horseshoe is a large central valley with low rolling hills covered by dense stands of cholla and other cacti, ocotillo, and an occasional agave.
Viewed from the west, the striking light, almost white, granite peaks contrast sharply with the rich green creosote and cactus-covered bajadas. A few miles from the Colorado River, the mountains change dramatically from light-colored granite to dark red and gray volcanic spires and mesas.

A chalcogel or properly metal chalcogenide aerogel is an aerogel made from chalcogenides. Chalcogels preferentially absorb heavy metals, such as mercury, lead, and cadmium, from water. Sulfide chalcogels are also very good at desulfurization.
Metal chalcogenide aerogels can be prepared from thiolysis or nanoparticle condensation and contain crystalline nanoparticles in the structure. The synthetic method can be extended to many thioanions, including tetrathiomolybdate-based chalcogels. Different metal ions have been used as linkers Co2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Bi3+, Cr3+.
When the gels are dried aerogels with high surface areas are obtained and the materials have multifunctional nature. For example, chalcogels are especially promising for gas separation. They were reported to exhibit high selectivity in CO2 and C2H6 over H2 and CH4 adsorption. The latter is relevant to exit gas stream composition of water gas shift reaction and steam reforming reactions (reactions widely used for H2 production). For example, separation of gas pairs such as CO2/H2, CO2/CH4, and CO2/N2 are key steps in precombustion capture of CO2, natural gas sweetening and postcombustion capture of CO2 processes leading ultimately at upgrading of the raw gas. The above mentioned conditioning makes the gas suitable for a number of applications in fuel cells.
Chalcogels were shown to be very effective at capturing radionuclides from nuclear waste such as 99Tc, and 238U, and especially 129I.

In enzymology, a chalcone isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
a chalcone a flavanone
Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, a chalcone, and one product, a flavanone.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically the class of intramolecular lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is flavanone lyase (decyclizing). This enzyme is also called chalcone-flavanone isomerase. This enzyme participates in flavonoid biosynthesis.
The Petunia hybrida (Petunia) genome contains two genes coding for very similar enzymes, ChiA and ChiB, but only the first seems to encode a functional chalcone isomerase.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
Chalcone isomerase has a core 2-layer alpha/beta structure consisting of beta(3)-alpha(2)-beta-alpha(2)-beta(3).

The 2022–23 East Asia Super League will be the first regular season of the East Asia Super League, an international basketball club competition involving teams from domestic leagues in Japan, South Korea, Philippines, and Taiwan as well as a well as a franchise team representing Greater China.
Team allocation
Four leagues are represented for the 2022–23 EASL. The champions and runners-up of the Japan B.League and the Korean Basketball League as well as the champions of Taiwan's P. League+ Hong Kong based Bay Area Chun Yu Phoenixes, a franchise team not part of any domestic league will also participate. The league considers the P. League+ champions and the Phoenixes as representatives of "Greater China".
For the Philippines, the top two finishing teams of the 2022 PBA Philippine Cup qualified. Initially, the Philippine allocation was unclear since the Philippine Basketball Association holds multiple conferences or tournaments across a single season. Among the plans considered include: drawing of lots among the top four PBA teams, forming a selection team, or entering the national team.
Each team may have 12-men roster with two foreign players and an additional Asian player.
Qualified teams
Preparation
Original draw
The official draw for the 2022–23 EASL season was held on 28 June 2022 at the Shangri-La at the Fort, Manila in Taguig.
The teams were drawn in two groups. A coin flipping mechanic were used; each champion in each domestic league were made to choose a coin side. The winner of the coin flip were placed on Group A while the other placed in Group B. The identity of the Philippine representatives were yet to be determined at the time of the draw.
Each club was to play all the other clubs twice in home and away matches starting from 12 October 2022 to February 2023, with two EASL Group Stage games taking place every Wednesday night. The final four were to be play in a venue Metro Manila in the Philippines in March 2023.
Cancellation and Champions Week
A few weeks before the supposed opening day, the league announced the cancellation of the home and away season, instead pushing through with a "Champions Week" that will be held in Manila in early 2023. The COVID-19 pandemic was blamed for the cancellation.

Eosta is a multinational enterprise, based in the Netherlands, working in the field of organic food. The company specializes in the import, export and distribution of fresh organic fruits and vegetables. Eosta imports overseas fruits from Africa, South America, Oceania, Asia and North America. In 2017 Eosta's CEO, Volkert Engelsman, was elected Most Influential Sustainability Voice of the Netherlands in the yearly sustainability top-100 list by the newspaper Trouw, who called him "a greengrocer with a radical vision".
Name
The name Eosta contains the Greek word "Eos", the goddess of sunrise.
History
Eosta was founded in 1990 by Dutch entrepreneurs Volkert Engelsman and Willem van Wijk, in response to new rising demand in supermarkets for fresh organic food produce as well as the growth of the health food sector. Since then the company grew to be a major player in the European market for organic fruits and vegetables, exporting to Germany, the UK, Scandinavia, Belgium, France and other European countries, as well as the United States, Singapore and Hong Kong. In 2007 its subsidiary Soil & More Impacts was founded, an agricultural consultancy enterprise.
Transparency and Sustainability
Nature & More is a consumer trademark and online transparency system used by Eosta. Nature & More started out in 2004 as a nonprofit foundation, but was later integrated into the company. Products with the Nature & More brand carry a QR-code or a three-digit code, which buyers can enter on a website to access information about the organic grower behind the product. This allows them to inform themselves about the impact of the product on different aspects of ecological and social sustainability, which are measured by a GRI-based model called the Sustainability Flower. The transparency system won a Sustainable Entrepreneurship Award in Vienna, Austria, in 2013.
The Sustainability Flower is the model for sustainability that Eosta uses to, as they say, "measure, manage, market and monetise" the impact of production on natural capital and social capital. The model was developed by an international group of companies and NGO's in 2009. Other companies in the organic field such as SEKEM (Egypt) and Soil & More Impacts (Germany) use the same model, but with a different graphic interpretation. Eosta's version of the Sustainability Flower has seven petals which each stand for a different aspect of ecological and social sustainability. These are evaluated quantitatively by Key Point Indicators based on GRI standards. The Sustainability Flower is used to assess the performance of organic farmers and growers. Subsequently, True Cost Accounting is used to put a monetary value on these impacts. According to Volker Engelsman, the company "[...] serves an awareness elite, people who are concerned about health, the environment, social issues. We don't try to compete with the lowest prices but to capitalize on the benefits of our growers – they are not just organic, but also socially and environmentally responsible."
Campaigns and innovations
Eosta launched several innovations and campaigns in the field of sustainable food and packaging over the years. In 2018, Eosta won a European Business Award for the Environment for its True Cost of Food campaign, an awareness campaign about True Cost Accounting in food and agriculture. Another campaign in 2016 under the name "Natural Branding" introduced laser marking, whereby laser tattoos are applied to pieces of fruit and vegetables to reduce the use of plastic stickers and packaging materials. The Guardian reported on it.
True Cost Accounting
In 2017 Eosta released a True Cost Accounting report on its impacts. The report, named "True Cost Accounting in Food, Farming and Finance" was presented to Prince Charles. Eosta's pilot calculated the impact costs of soil erosion and water pollution for several products, including organic apples from Argentina and organic oranges from South Africa. These numbers were compared with non-organic products. The report also included an integrated profit and loss statement for Eosta; one of the first to be published for a SME company worldwide. Eosta's CEO Volkert Engelsman said in Der Spiegel: "Apples in the supermarket for 99 cents per kilogram are not really a bargain, when the true costs for growing these apples are eventually put on the shoulders of the government and the tax payer." Experts at FAO estimate the hidden environmental costs of worldwide food production at 1900 billion Euro per year.
Controversy
In 2016 Eosta's CEO, Volkert Engelsman, accused Dutch supermarkets, specifically Albert Heijn, of "criminal behaviour" in the Dutch financial daily paper Het Financieele Dagblad. Engelsman said: "Many supermarkets do not pay a realistic price to growers. By doing so, they avert health costs and environmental costs and put them on the shoulders of society. Academics call this a systemic failure, I call it criminal." Albert Heijn commented that it did not recognize itself in the description and would set up a meeting with Engelsman.

The 18th South African Parliament was the eighteenth Parliament of South Africa to convene since the unification of South Africa in 1910 and the sixth to convene since the adoption of the republican constitution in 1961. It was elected in the 1981 South African general election and consisted of the unicameral House of Assembly. The House of Assembly contained 165 members.
Three different parties were represented in this parliament; the National Party (NP), the Progressive Federal Party (PFP), and the New Republic Party (NRP). The majority party in the 17th parliament, the National Party retained its majority, although it was reduced to 131 seats, down from the 134 out of 165 seats it had in the previous parliament.

The Wetar figbird (Sphecotheres hypoleucus) is a species of bird in the family Oriolidae. It is endemic to forest, woodland and scrub on the Indonesian island of Wetar. The Wetar figbird remains poorly known, and although threatened by habitat loss, recent population estimates are greater than originally estimated, resulting in it being now listed as Least Concern by BirdLife International and the IUCN. The Wetar figbird resembles the better known Australasian figbird, but is much smaller and the male has entirely white underparts. Formerly, it has been considered a subspecies of the green figbird, but they are now classified as two separate species.

In molecular biology, Sphinx (spx) is a long non-coding RNA found in Drosophila. It is expressed in the brain, within the antennal lobe and inner antennocerebral tract. It is involved in the regulation of male courtship behaviour, this may be via olfactory neuron mediated regulation. Sphinx may act as a negative regulator of target genes. It is a chimeric gene, originating from a retroposed sequence of the ATP synthase chain F gene from chromosome 2 to chromosome 4. Nearby sequences were recruited to form an intron and an exon of this chimeric gene.

Linden Airport is a mile southeast of downtown Linden, in Union County, New Jersey. Also known as Linden Municipal Airport, it is next to U.S. Route 1&9. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a general aviation reliever airport.
History
During World War II General Motors automobile factory across the street from the airport called Linden Assembly, produced military aircraft.
When World War II started Grumman Aircraft Corporation contracted with the recently created Eastern Aircraft Corporation (a GM company) to take over the manufacture of the Wildcat and Avenger aircraft for the US Navy and its Allies. This would allow Grumman to focus on the development and production of Hellcat. The Wildcat was manufactured in Linden, NJ and towed across the street to the Linden Airport for test flying and delivery.
Construction of Linden Airport was started in the spring of 1942 and completed by October 1942. During the war Eastern Aircraft produced about 3,600 FM-1 and FM-2 Wildcats. After the war Linden Airport was turned over to the city of Linden which still owns and operates the airport under contract.
The original airport with its intersecting runways and large hangar remained intact until 1998 when the City of Linden, needing more tax-ratable property decided to divide up the underutilized airport to create a shopping center called Aviation Plaza on the north side of the field. A new airport was built on the south side complete with new taxiways, hangars and parking areas. The only remaining part of the original airport is the west to east (9-27) runway.
The airport is the only non-towered (no control tower) airport in the New York City metro area. Its close proximity to New York City and relatively light air traffic makes it an ideal location for basing news helicopters for New York's news channels. The airport is home to many sightseeing and commuter helicopters that fill the skies over New York.
In 2010 Linden Airport hosted the New York City round of the Red Bull Air Race World Championship.
Facilities
Linden Airport covers 188 acres (76 ha) at an elevation of 22 feet (7 m). Its asphalt runway, 9/27, is 4,140 by 100 feet (1,262 x 30 m).
In the year ending January 8, 2002 the airport had 42,925 aircraft operations, average 117 per day: 99% general aviation and 1% military. 91 aircraft were then based at this airport: 70% single-engine, 18% helicopter, 11% multi-engine, and 1% jet.
Racing venue
The airport served as a temporary road racing course for the eighteenth race of the 1954 NASCAR Grand National (now NASCAR Cup Series) season. Buck Baker qualified on the pole position for the race with a speed of . Al Keller won the 50-lap race over a course on June 13 in a field of 43 cars. The rest of the top five finishers were Joe Eubanks, Baker, Bill Claren, and Bob Grossman. Finishing sixth through tenth: Larry LaVois, Herb Thomas, Dick Rathman, Laird Bruner, and Lee Petty.

Savalde (also spelled as 'Sawalde', 'Sawalda', 'Savalda') is a village in Shahada taluka in Nandurbar district of Maharashtra state in India. Savalde village is situated around 5 km South-west of Shahada, situated on the bank of river Tapti(Tapi) and on state border of states of Maharashtra and Gujarat.
Village
Savalde village is situated around 5 km away from Nandurbar and around 1 km west from Maharashtra State Highway Number 1 on Shahada-Nandurbar road. It is situated just 1 km away from the official state border between Gujarat and Maharashtra states of India. Many houses in this border village are built on a single mountain on the bank of river Tapti. Occupation of almost all the villagers is farming or related work. For important shopping, health treatment or higher education villagers go to Shahada or Prakasha which are easily accessible by bus, private vehicle or stopping any on route to Shahada passenger riksha on Highway. Fresh vegetables and milk in Shahada town comes from villages like Savalde. It is slowly becoming an important point to enter Maharashtra from Gujarat.
Seismograph station
Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd has installed 9 seismograph stations around Sardar Sarovar Dam to monitor any seismic activity due to water in dam. These stations are Alirajpur Badwani Kooksi in Madhya Pradesh, Sagbara Ghabana Jeetgarh Kwant Naswadi in Gujarat and Shahada in Maharashtra. Out of these 9 seismograph stations around Sardar sarovar dam, only two seismograph stations, Shahada and Sagbara, are fully functional. Shahada is one of these 9 Seismograph Stations. As seismograph machines are installed away from ground vehicle traffic, seismograph machine is installed in the west direction of Savalde village, just outside the village. Seismograph station at Savalde was also worn out and was not in working condition until 10 November 2006 Savalde earthquake.
10 November 2006 earthquake
In the night of 10 November 2006, Savalde villagers reported to Shahada Police Station sounds coming from underground and ground vibrations. After verification, police vans alerted people in Shahada town and nearby villages to remain alert. Nothing happened in the night of 10 November. But in the afternoon of next day, tremors of magnitude 2.8 struck to Shahada tahsil region. No damage done to property or any life anywhere except cracks on the walls of few houses in Savalde village. Scientists from GSDA(Groundwater Surveys and Development Agency) and MERI (Maharashtra Engineering Research Institute) Nasik visited the Savalde village and concluded that underground sounds and tremors occurred because of pressure of weak lithosphere on air pockets in natural or human made cavities inside lithosphere. Due to heavy rain in August 2006, pressure over weak lithosphere mantle increased. Weak lithosphere mantle crashed in this cavity and hence on air inside cavity which caused underground sounds and tremors.

The Angel's Game (El juego del ángel, 2008) is a prequel to 2001's The Shadow of the Wind, by Spanish author Carlos Ruiz Zafón. The novel marks a return to The Cemetery of Forgotten Books in Barcelona's Raval district, and the Sempere & Sons bookshop. Like The Shadow of the Wind, it was translated into English by Lucia Graves and published in 2009.
Plot
The Angel's Game is set in Barcelona in the 1920s and 1930s and follows a young writer, David Martin.
In a once-abandoned mansion at the heart of Barcelona, Martín makes his living by writing sensationalist crime stories under a pseudonym. The survivor of a troubled childhood, he has taken refuge in the world of books and spends his nights spinning baroque, "grand guignol" tales about the city's underworld.
His own life begins to take on a dramatic bent, in the form of a number of complex relationships: with Pedro Vidal, his patron, with Cristina, the daughter of Vidal's chauffeur, and with Isabella, a young admirer of David and his work.
Furthermore, the history of the house he lives in begins to seep into his life - in a locked room within the house lie photographs and letters hinting at the mysterious death of the previous owner. At the same time he receives a letter from a reclusive but wealthy French editor, Andreas Corelli, who makes him an irresistible offer. He is to write a book unlike anything that has ever existed—an attempt at a new religious work with the power to change hearts and minds. Yet as David begins the work, he realizes that there is a connection between his haunting book and the shadows that surround his home.
Reception
The Canadian Press's Maclean's Magazine placed The Angel's Game as number one for their top ten hardcover fiction books for the week ending July 7, 2009. Marley Walker called it "Zafon's ambitious new historic melodrama." USA Today praised The Angel's Game as "a multi-layered confection that combines undying love, magical realism, meditations on religion, the importance of books and a love affair with the vibrant city of Barcelona."
Andrew Reimer said, "Here is more of the same from the author of The Shadow of the Wind " which "is bound to make his fans whoop with joy." However, he also added, "the climax of this new tale is a bit of a mess, with too many twists and turns and perhaps a few too many corpses." Terrence Rafferty wrote that "Ruiz Zafón's flamboyant pulp epic is something altogether sillier, a pact-with-the-devil tale whose only purpose is to give its readers some small intimation of the darker pleasures of the literary arts, the weird thrill of storytelling without conscience."
Aravind Adiga of The Age complained that there was "plenty that is ludicrous, clichéd and schematic," but explained that "[l]overs of Barcelona will enjoy Ruiz Zafón's skillful use of that city's architecture--Gothic and Modern."

Anytime! (A Live Set) is a live acoustic album by Steve Harley, released under the name The Steve Harley Band and featuring members of the Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel line-up of the time. It was released in 2004.
Background
Following the early 2003 release of the live album Acoustic and Pure: Live, Harley soon organised a new UK and Irish acoustic tour for May–June 2003, which would feature four members of Cockney Rebel - Barry Wickens, Robbie Gladwell, James Lascelles and Lincoln Anderson. In a June online diary entry, Harley revealed that several shows on the tour had been recorded for a future live CD. He commented:
Later in October, he announced the idea of using tracks from both the Huntingdon Hall and the Jazz Café concerts for the album. He also spoke of the possibility of including one or two newly-recorded studio tracks, as well as an unreleased studio track from Harley's sessions with Mickie Most in the mid-1980s. By November, Harley announced that he was considering mixing the live tracks and getting the album ready for a release in March 2004, to coincide with an upcoming UK tour.
During November, work commenced on the live recordings, with Harley working with engineer Matt Butler. Harley revealed in a diary entry that month:
In January 2004, Harley announced the new album was on schedule for being released at the beginning of the upcoming tour. By the end of that month, the album's title had been decided upon, while the artwork had also been completed. Harley commented: "I like it a lot. Matt Butler has done a fine job of re-mixing the sound and the Worcester and Jazz Café audiences do more than their bit. There is some really brilliant playing from the band. It will be on sale from the first night of the tour, in lobbies around Britain, from Southampton to, well, Glasgow, eh!" Anytime! (A Live Set) was released in 2004. It features eleven live tracks and a bonus track; "Sophistication", which was a previously unreleased studio recording from 1986. To date, it remains exclusive to the album.
In June 2005 interview with Record Collector magazine's Nick Dalton, Harley spoke of his current musical style: "Anytime! is seriously unplugged electro-acoustic. It's similar to original Cockney Rebel – violin, no electric guitar. But I still like playing with my electric band. I'm doing Glastonbury again, headlining the acoustic stage for the first time."
Sophistication
The previously unreleased track "Sophistication", from 1986, was produced by Harley and Mickie Most. Like much of Harley's output from the same period, the song was due to be released on Harley's solo album El Gran Senor. However, the album was shelved and left unreleased after RAK Records went bankrupt later in the year. Although many of the songs would later be re-recorded for Harley's 1992 album Yes You Can, "Sophistication" remained unreleased. Despite this, Harley frequently performed the song live during 1989, after Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel made a return to touring with the "Come Back, All is Forgiven" tour.
The song features Andrew Gold on keyboards. Harley later recalled in 2015,
While Harley was considering the release of a new live album, he had first mentioned the possibility of releasing "Sophistication" in an October 2003 diary entry. Speaking of an "old recording", he said: "Don't imagine even the most fervent and enterprising among you has the track I'm thinking of on bootleg! Only Mickie Most and I ever took copies and the master tapes are here in this house. Gotcha!" Later in November, Harley sent the song's quarter-inch tape to engineer Matt Butler. In a diary entry at that time, Harley revealed: "Waiting to hear from Matt regarding the state of the quarter-inch tape he's been sent. It's 17 years old and will need treating with kid gloves."
Release
The album was released by Gott Discs on CD in the UK only. Pinnacle Records handled the album's distribution. The album had been licensed to Gott by Harley's own Comeuppance Ltd. The album's photographs of Harley, including the front cover shot, had been taken by Manfred Esser during October 2003 in Germany. Today, the album is out of print.
Track listing
Critical reception
In 2005, Peter Makowski of Classic Rock reviewed Anytime! (A Live Set) and commented: "Mr Soft gets unplugged. A few months ago I saw Pete Doherty play a solo acoustic show at my local. Never a big fan of The Libertines, I must admit that he was spectacular. Solo and hype-free, you could see that he was actually a gifted songwriter. The same goes for Steve Harley who is a craftsman with a canny ear for a hook and catchy chorus. Both artistes have attitude and conviction; both are former buskers. Here 'live and unplugged' the former Cockney Rebel takes us through a tour of all the hits and more. But it's the lesser-known material like the emotive "A Friend for Life" that makes Harley sound fresh and edgy, like a latter day Libertine."
Joe Geesin of the webzine Get Ready to Rock! said: "Opener "Mr Soft" has an uptempo quirky offbeat, while the violin on "Mirror Freak" adds an interesting if moody touch. Ballads, rockers and acoustic strumming, all the styles explored do nod back to the pub rock roots, and many emphasise Harley's songwriting. Of course there's the obligatory "Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)" which does work rather well. Thoroughly enjoyable, but probably more for the fans." In the 2007 Italian book 24.000 Dischi (24,000 discs), Riccardo Bertoncelli and Cris Thellung stated: "An acoustic concert, new songs and interpretations of old classics, which are still beautiful and mostly performed by Harley with a passion and feeling really touching."

Juan Manuel Abal Medina (born March 1, 1945) is an Argentine journalist and politician who served as Secretary General of the Peronist Movement between 1972 and 1974. He later became a prominent lawyer in Mexico.
Early life and entry into politics
Abal Medina was born to a wealthy family of a conservative Catholic orientation. He enrolled at the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires and became a supporter of Julio Meinvielle's Nationalist Restoration Guard. Abal Medina joined the editorial board of Azul y Blanco, a weekly news magazine in Buenos Aires, in 1966. Directed by Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo and Ricardo Curutchet, both scions of traditional Argentine upper-class families, the nationalist publication supported the Argentine military, which had taken power in a 1966 coup. Azul y Blanco opposed the government of General Juan Carlos Onganía, however, which its editors believed to be subordinating national interests to those of foreign investors. Abal Medina married the former Cristina Moldes in 1966, and they had five children.
His younger brother, Fernando, worked in the periodical's circulation office, and in 1968, co-founded the Montoneros guerrilla organization, becoming its first leader. Fernando Abal Medina participated in the May 1970 abduction and subsequent murder of a former dictator, General Pedro Aramburu, and on September 4, was killed in a police raid in the Buenos Aires suburb of William Morris.
Perón and Peronism
Abal Medina was introduced to Perón in 1971. He had not been a Peronist; indeed, Meinvielle's GRN, to which he had belonged as a youth, was among the most anti-Peronist political groups in Argentina. He soon developed a good rapport with the leader of the Steelworkers' Union, Lorenzo Miguel, and the latter's close ally, CGT Secretary General José Ignacio Rucci, however. Perón had been in exile since the 1955 coup, and was represented in Argentina by a series of appointed delegates. Daniel Paladino, Perón's delegate since 1969, fell out of favor with much of the party machinery (as well as with their chief base of support, the CGT labor union) over differences in strategy as well as over his relatively conciliatory stance toward the dictatorship, and was dismissed by the national committee in November 1971. His successor, Héctor Cámpora, was supported by the left-leaning Peronist Youth, and assumed the post during a period of increasingly bold overtures toward the banned Peronist Movement by the dictator, General Alejandro Lanusse. Pursuant to an August 1971 announcement that preparations of elections would begin, and despite his original intent that Peronists be excluded, he allowed the courts to legalize Peronism on January 26, 1972.
Backed by labor, and in good terms with the military, Abal Medina was named Secretary of Operativo Retorno ("Operation Return") by Cámpora. Perón was 76, and rumors that he was suffering from both ill health and early signs of senility conspired with the myriad conditions imposed by President Lanusse on Peronists to make the exiled leader's return increasingly unlikely. The decision to field Cámpora as a stand-in candidate in elections announced for March 1973 resulted in Abal Medina's election as Secretary General of the Justicialist Party on June 25, 1972, and he became Perón's official delegate in September. Abal Medina's ties to the military and the right notwithstanding, Perón calculated that naming a brother of the late Fernando Abal Medina would do much to placate the restive Montoneros. A series of secret negotiations with military officers and Lanusse's Interior Minister, Arturo Mor Roig, ultimately led to Lanusse's permission for Perón's return, which took place on November 17.
Abal Medina led the selection process for the over 3,500 FREJULI candidates for Congressional, provincial, and local offices in these, the first elections in Argentina of any kind since 1965. He was, moreover, instrumental in persuading Rucci to drop his opposition to a number of key nominations, among them to the candidate for Governor of Buenos Aires, Oscar Bidegain, and to Cámpora, himself. Camporá was elected President in a landslide on March 11, and among the Peronist Youth, whose preferred candidates Abal Medina had retained on the ballot over Rucci's heated objections, the skilled young negotiator was now seen as a future leader.
He made the first serious mistake, however, when the candidate he chose for a Senate seat for Buenos Aires (his friend and former newspaper colleague, Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo), was defeated in an upset by the neophyte UCR candidate, Fernando de la Rúa. His choices for other offices also became complications for Abal Medina. Eight of the candidates he chose for the Lower House to represent Buenos Aires were, in fact, elected. One of these, Nilda Garré Coppello, began an extramarital affair with Abal Medina, resulting in the termination of both their marriages in 1973; Garré and Abal Medina married that year, and they had three children.
Garré, Santiago Díaz Ortiz, and the six others soon became known in Congress as the "Gang of Eight" for their increasingly vocal opposition to Perón's nomination of his right-wing wife, Isabel, as his running mate in snap elections called for September. Abal Medina's support of the Perón–Perón ticket, in turn, distanced him from the Montoneros, one of whose leaders, José Pablo Ventura, issued a public threat against him, shouting at a rally: "Abal Medina: your blood is a bargain in Argentina!"
The alliance of Montoneros with Perón had effectively ended when, in September 1973, Rucci was assassinated. The murder of numerous other public figures followed, and on March 23, 1974, Abal Medina suffered an attempt on his own life. He was convinced, however, that the attack had been carried out by a new threat sponsored from within the Perón government: the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (Triple A). The Triple A was secretly commanded by Perón's astrologer and closest adviser, José López Rega, who had been given the Social Welfare portfolio (and thus controlled 30 percent of the federal budget). Abal Medina's car was bombed shortly afterward in a second (unsuccessful) attack, and in May, he was removed as Secretary General of the party.
Exile and new associations
Perón died in July and was succeeded by his wife, whose government presided over spiraling violence and inflation. She was overthrown in a March 1976 coup. Most lawmakers and other political figures had advance knowledge of the March 24 coup, and Peronists (nearly all of whom were to be arrested) took added precautions, with some opting to leave the country. Abal Medina sought refuge in the Mexican Embassy, and he remained there for years. He shared the refuge with Cámpora, who in 1980 was allowed to leave to Mexico, where he died shortly afterward.
Abal Medina also sought exile in Mexico upon obtaining a safe conduct in 1982. Divorced from his second wife, he had a minor post at the Traffic and Transportation Secretariat and served as an agent of CISEN (Mexican State Intelligence) during the 1988–94 tenure of Interior Secretary Fernando Gutiérrez Barrios. He became close to the PRI (the ruling party in Mexico until 2000), maintained a close friendship with the leader of the rival PRD, Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, and frequently visited Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
He established a successful law practice in Mexico, and later opened offices in Spain and Argentina. The CEO of Telmex, Carlos Slim, hired Abal Medina as an adviser for his growing interests in Argentina, and in 2007, he was invited by outgoing Argentine President Néstor Kirchner to join the cabinet of his wife and successor, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. He cited worsening respiratory problems and refused, however.
Abal Medina visits Argentina often. His eldest son, Juan Manuel, served both Kirchner administrations in a number of significant political and policy posts.

Any Port in a Storm is the debut album released by the Reggae band The Dirty Heads in 2008. The Special Edition was released in 2010. This is the only album without Matt Ochoa as the band's drummer. Any Port in a Storm was initially set to be released on Warner Bros. Records until the label and band mutually separated. The Dirty Heads, having kept the master recordings, later released the album through Executive Music Group (EMG), a division of Universal Music Group.
Billy Preston plays keyboards on multiple tracks on the album, in what would be one of the final sessions he recorded before his death. "Lay Me Down" was released as a single from this album. It peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.
Reviews
Any Port in a Storm has received generally mixed reviews from music critics. Writing for Allmusic, Ritchie Unterberger said the band "comfortably combine hip-hop and reggae with somewhat lesser dollops of conventional rock songwriting and arrangements" on the album. Dan Raper of PopMatters called it a "scattershot debut" and remarked that the Dirty Heads' "simplistic rhyme schemes and disconcerting use of the F-bomb ... quickly demonstrate there are leagues between this dick-hop and the intelligent, twisted witticisms of Why?"

FMC Technologies, Inc. was a North American company that produced equipment for exploration and production of hydrocarbons. FMC Technologies was incorporated in 2000 when FMC Corporation divested its machinery businesses. It exists today as a part of TechnipFMC, after a merge with Technip in 2017.
History
FMC Technologies was a provider of systems and solutions to the oil and gas industry. The company was divided into three business areas: Subsea Technologies, Surface Technologies and Energy Infrastructures. FMC Technologies designed, manufactured and serviced systems and products such as subsea production and processing systems, surface wellhead systems, high pressure pumps and fluid control equipment, measurement solutions and marine loading systems.
FMC Technologies originally existed for decades as a division of Food Machinery Corporation, or FMC. The division's transition into a distinct business entity began in 2000, when FMC announced plans to restructure itself into two separate, publicly traded companies - a machinery business (FMC Technologies) and a chemicals business (FMC Corporation). FMC Technologies, Inc. began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on June 14, 2001. In 2008, FMC Technologies spun off its FoodTech and Airport businesses into a new, independent, publicly traded company called JBT Corporation. In 2009, the company acquired Multi Phase Meters (MPM), a Norwegian technology company that provides advanced instrumentation for the oil industry.
In 2014, FMC Technologies divested its Material Handling Products business to Syntron Material Handling, LLC, an affiliate of Levine Leichtman Capital Partners.
Globally, FMC Technologies had approximately 17,400 employees by 2015, consisting of approximately 5,700 in the United States and 11,700 in non-U.S. locations. The company had a total of 30 locations in 16 countries, including the United States, Norway, Brazil, Scotland, Singapore, Australia, Poland, Russia, India, Angola and Nigeria. Its headquarters were located in northern Houston, Texas. In Norway there were about 3800 employees, working at locations in Kongsberg, Asker, Bergen, Stavanger, Kristiansund, Floro and Notodden. On October 1, 2012, the company acquired Pure Energy Services. In the same year, FMC Technologies was named by Fortune (magazine) as the World's Most Admired Oil and Gas Equipment, Service Company.
On May 19, 2016, it was announced that FMC Technologies would team up with French Technip to create a new company called TechnipFMC. After the approval of regulatory authorities, TechnipFMC began operating as a unified company in Jan 17, 2017. The all-share deal resulted in a company with a market value of about $13 billion.
